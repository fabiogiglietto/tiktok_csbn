Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother, so one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling washed over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he Was one afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, he said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

It happened during an argument about her curfew. Carmen would let me stay out until midnight, she screamed. She actually understands me. I wish she was my real mom instead of you. I stood there in our kitchen holding the car keys she wanted, feeling something inside me shatter. Carmen, my ex husband's 26 year old wife, yoga instructor who bought my daughter designer clothes and let her drink wine at dinner. The cool mom who didn't enforce bedtimes or check homework. Your curfew is still ten PM, I said quietly slipping the keys into my pocket. I hate you, Natalie shouted. You're ruining my life, dad and Carmen treat me like an adult. She ran to her room and slammed the door. I heard her immediately on the phone. Mom's being a total bitch again. Can you come get me? 40 minutes later, my ex pulled up in his BMW, didn't even come to the door. Natalie dragged her overnight bag downstairs refusing to look at me. I'm staying at dad's this week, maybe permanently. Natalie, you have school. Carmen will drive me. She doesn't have a real job anyway. The job was intentional. I work 50 hours a week as a nurse to keep our apartment, pay for her braces, her phone, her life. Carmen teaches yoga three times a week and post motivational quotes on Instagram. After they left, I sat on Natalie's bed, looked Around her room, the walls still had the stars we painted together when she was 7. The bookshelf I built with my own hands, the quilt my mother made before she passed. But her Instagram was full of photos from her dad's house, Carmen's pristine kitchen, the pool, the shopping sprees, captions like with my favourite person, heart, eyes under, selfies with Carmen. Not one photo of us. I was the one up all night when she had pneumonia at 3. I taught her how to ride a bike, how to read, how to be kind. I worked doubles to pay for her dance classes while her father found himself in Thailand for six months. But Carmen was fun. Carmen was young. Carmen didn't make her eat vegetables or go to bed or study. Natalie stayed at her dad's for 2 weeks, posted constantly about her amazing bonus mom and their girls nights. Carmen taught her how to contour, bought her outfits. I'd said we're too grown up. Let her boyfriend sleep over. Then Carmen got bored. I got the call at 2:00am, Natalie crying, mom, can you come get me? What's wrong? Dad and Carmen went to Vegas. They left me here alone. I, I think someone's trying to break in. I drove 20 minutes in my pajamas, a baseball bat on the passenger seat, found her hiding in the bathroom shaking. The break in turned out to be tree branches scratching the window. But she'd been alone for Two days. I said I was mature enough to handle it, she whispered in the car. Carmen said it was good practice for college. You're 15. I know. Back home, I made her hot chocolate, real cocoa, not the sugar free kind Carmen buys. Natalie sat at.

Marry him anyway, my grandmother told me when I showed her the prenup my fiance's lawyer had drawn up. But first become exactly what they think you are. Everyone else said to run. My friends were horrified. My sister called me pathetic. The prenup basically said if we divorced, I'd get nothing. No alimony, no assets, no claim to anything acquired during marriage. Brian came from old money. His family was convinced I was a gold digger, a nurse marrying a tech CEO for his bank account. The prenup was their idea, protecting their precious son from the calculating poor girl. Sign it, grandma said, then go back to school. With what money? His. She was right. The prenup said nothing about education expenses during marriage, thing about him paying for my life while married. It only protected assets and divorce. So I signed it. His family celebrated. His mother actually said, so glad you understand your place. The day after our wedding, I enrolled in law school. Ryan thought it was cute. My little wife wants to be a lawyer. His friends laughed about how I'd never finish. I finished top of my class, law review, passed the bar, first try. His mother sneered at graduation. Such a waste. You'll be having babies soon. Anyway, I started my MBA next. Ryan paid for everything. We were married, shared finances. The prenup couldn't touch that. His family rolled their eyes at family Dinners while I discussed international business law. Seven years in, I had a law degree, an MBA and had started a consulting firm with the money Ryan gave me for shopping. Built it from nothing to six figures while being the perfect trophy wife at his events. His family still treated me like trash, still made jokes about the prenup protecting them from me. Ryan started believing them, getting cocky, cheating because what was I going to do, leave with nothing? Year 10, I filed for divorce. Ryan laughed. You get nothing. Remember that prenup you signed? Actually, I said I get everything I built. While the prenup protected his pre marriage assets and his income, it said nothing about businesses started during marriage with marital funds. My law degree taught me that. My MBA helped me build it. My consulting firm was worth $2 million. Started with his money? Yes, but legally mine. That's fraud, his mother screamed at mediation. That's marriage. My lawyer, my study partner from law school replied she used marital assets to build her own career. Completely legal. They tried to fight it at $300,000 on lawyers trying to break my business claim. But I documented everything perfectly, every dollar traced, every paper filed correctly. My grandmother's advice that everyone thought was stupid, become exactly what they think you are, then become something they never imagined. I thought I was a gold digger. Fine. I dug through their legal gold mine and found my own treasure. The best part was during the divorce proceedings, Ryan's lawyer tried to argue, I'd planned this all along.

My brother Ryan was marrying this absolute nightmare of a woman named Brianna. Nobody in our family could stand her, but Ryan was completely blind to it. She was controlling from day one. She told my mom she couldn't wear navy to the wedding because that was her color. She demanded our family pay for all the flowers, which cost, like $3,000. When I asked if I could bring my two kids to the wedding, she said absolutely not, because children would ruin her perfect day. But the worst part was when we found out she hadn't even sent an invitation to our grandma Helen. When my mom asked why, Brianna just shrugged and said grandma was boring and would probably fall asleep during the ceremony anyway. I was furious. Grandma Helen was 82 and had basically raised Ryan after our dad died. She taught him how to drive, helped him with homework every night, and even paid for his college textbooks when money was tight. When grandma found out she wasn't invited, she didn't yell or cry like I expected. She just sat quietly in her kitchen chair, nodding slowly. Then she looked up at me with this calm smile and said, well, we'll see about that, won't we? The wedding day came, and I was dreading every minute of it. The venue was actually this gorgeous old mansion that had been in our family for Decades. Grandma had let Ryan use it for free because she wanted his wedding to be special. I was standing there watching Brianna boss around the photographers, when suddenly I heard gasps from the guests. There was Grandma Helen walking up the main entrance in the most stunning gold gown I'd ever seen. She looks like royalty. She was carrying this leather folder under her arm and had the biggest smile on her face. Brianna spotted her immediately and marched over, her face turning bright red. What are you doing here? You weren't invited! Brianna screamed loud enough for everyone to hear. The entire wedding party stopped what they were doing to watch. Grandma didn't even

My neighbor, Mrs. Daniels, called 9 1 1 like it was her personal hotline. Monday she reported my kids for trespassing because their ball went in her yard. Wednesday she called the cops because my autistic son was making noise in our own backyard. Friday she called saying the kids were in danger because they were playing tag. The 9 1 1 operator probably recognized her voice better than her own family did. Things got worse as spring turned into summer and her calls went from annoying to actually dangerous. First, she called CPS and said we left our kids alone outside. I was sitting right there on the porch with a book when the social worker showed up. They close the case right away, but people had already started talking about us. Two weeks later, during my daughter's birthday party, she called the fire department about a gas leak. Five fire trucks showed up with their sirens going and scared all 12 kids at the party. The firefighters didn't find anything, but she went on Facebook saying we were probably making drugs. The worst thing happened in July when my autistic son had a meltdown in our yard. She called 9 1 1 and said a child was being beaten. Showed up ready for a domestic violence call and found me hugging my upset kid. Officer Martinez said something about her false reports, but Nothing happened to her. She started calling during my work zoom meetings on purpose. Other neighbors told me she kept notebooks full of made up complaints with dates and everything. She actually brag to people about making families like ours want to move away. Everything went crazy on a Tuesday in August when I got a letter from her lawyer wanting $15,000. She said we cause her emotional distress even though she was the one who called 9 1 1 53 times. I tried to talk to her like a normal person, but she said she'd add harassment to the lawsuit. That same day, my autistic son had his first friend from therapy come over to play. While the two kids were quietly playing with Legos, she called about suspicious people in my yard. Police cars surrounded my house, and both seven year olds were terrified.

Then boom, it hits 2:00am and a wave of sadness comes. I'll start crying, acting all depressed and watching videos that aren't even sad. Then start reposting some of them. Like I'll come across a video of a father and daughter and be like, huh, that could be me and my dad if he didn't leave. Then I'll come across one of those top 10 funniest moments on the Kevin Lang Show and I'm there cracking up, trying to hold in my laugh so I don't wake anyone up. Then suddenly I come across one of those gym motivation videos yelling at me through the screen, you want to be known as lazy your whole life and I'll be taking it serious, thinking, hell no. Then they say drop down and do 10 push UPS. So I do, but my noodle arms are so weak, I can't even do one. So the walk of shame, climbing back in my bed. But no, the adrenaline is still there. I set an alarm at 6:00am to go for a run. So then I decide to go sleep. Suddenly, I'm hit with the most embarrassing memories flooding my head. Every move shifts to a Different one. My brain is practically telling me, ha, remember this, you fucking loser. Eventually I fall asleep, then wake up from the fuck ass alarm I set and be like, who the heck did I think I was? And go back to sleep. So moral of the story, just go to bed early before the 5 stages of grief hit you. More stories coming soon.

After 12 hours of labor, the nurse handed me my son for the first time, and my brain completely rejected what my eyes were showing me. Sarah was destroyed from 12 hours of labor, her blonde hair plastered with sweat as she reached for our baby with shaking arms. But I stood paralyzed. The child in my white hands had deep brown skin and tightly coiled black hair that looked like someone had played the cruelest possible prank on us. Isn't he beautiful, Sarah whispered. And I forced myself to nod, even though my throat felt like it was closing. She must have seen something in my face because her smile faltered and she said, I know he doesn't look like what we expected, but remember what I told you about my great, great grandfather? I did remember vaguely some story about distant relatives with darker features, but this baby looked completely black. And my mind was racing with possibilities I didn't want to consider. The next few hours were a blur of nurses checking vitals and Sarah's family bursting through the door. They raced here for the emergency delivery while my family searched desperately for flights from Colorado. Her mother cradled our son like precious gold, and her sister kept touching his tiny fingers and saying he had Sarah's exact chin. Their pure joy made my doubts feel poisonous. Sarah watched me watching them and finally reached for my hand. Are you okay with this, she whispered. And her voice broke something open in me. I kissed her forehead and promised I'd be the best father this baby could have. This wasn't what we'd expected, but we were still a team. Nothing would change that. But the poison started seeping in. The moment I left the hospital to grab clothes from home, my phone exploded with messages from my mother, who'd seen the photos Sarah posted. That is not your child, her text said in all caps, followed by, I told you she wasn't good enough for our family. My best friend Jake called while I was driving and said, dude, I'm sorry, but there's no way. You need to get tested ASAP before you sign anything. Even my brother, who'd always loved Sarah, texted, man, the math isn't mathing here. By the time I got back to the hospital, my head was spinning with doubt. Sarah was nursing the baby and singing softly, looking like the perfect mother. But all I could think about was how she'd been working late so many nights during her pregnancy and how her phone was always face down on the counter. My mother called again while Sarah was sleeping and spent 20 minutes listing every time she'd caught Sarah in a lie, which were really just miscommunications, but suddenly seemed sinister. She played you for a fool, my mother said, and now she's trying to pass off another man's baby as yours. The Next morning, I couldn't even look at the baby without feeling sick. Sarah noticed immediately and asked what was wrong. But I just shrugged and said I was tired. She tried again, reminding me about her cousin Marcus, who had similar features, even pulling up photos on her phone. But my mother's voice kept echoing in my head, especially after her text that morning saying there were no flights left and she'd come when things were sorted out. When the discharge papers came, I told Sarah I needed air and walked out of the hospital. I sat in my car for an hour reading text after text from friends and family, all saying the same thing, that I was being scammed, that no genealogy could explain this, that I needed to protect myself. I didn't go back inside. Instead, I texted Sarah that I needed a paternity test before we were done, then turned off my phone and drove to my buddy's house to crash on his couch. My brother caught the first flight out when I finally called him, and we spent days feeding each other's doubts while I ignored Sarah's desperate attempts to reach me. She's probably scrambling to figure out her story, my brother said when we grabbed beers at some dive bar near. Thank god you didn't sign the birth certificate, my mother added during one of her hourly calls, her voice full of relief, like I dodged a bullet instead of abandoned my family when I finally agreed to meet for the test. I made.

I lost my son to the streets when he was 14. That was it. Deshawn started running with the nigeltron, stealing, carrying guns, disappearing for weeks at a time. His dad was in prison, so it was just me working double shifts at the hospital while watching my baby throw his life away piece by piece. But I fought like hell to get him back. I never stopped praying he'd come home alive. That year, everything changed completely. Deshawn got arrested on a weapons charge, facing ten years as an adult. But the feds made him an offer. Cooperate with their investigation, testify against his crew, and he'd get probation plus witness Protection. They promised me he'd be safe. We've done this hundreds of times, Mrs. Serena. Your son will be completely protected. This is his ticket out of this life forever. Deshawn took the deal without hesitation. When he was freed eight months later, something was different in his eyes. He looked at me and said, Mama, I'm done with this life. I wanna make you proud for once. The prosecutors relocated us across town. New apartment, new phone numbers, new identities. They said the gang thought he was still locked up. We were completely invisible. I went overboard helping him rebuild his entire future. Got him enrolled in GED classes, drove him to community college. Every morning at 7:00am sharp, he studied like his life depended on it. Which It literally did. Applied to Howard University for business administration. Talked constantly about opening an auto shop, helping kids like himself escape the streets. When the Howard acceptance letter came in March, full scholarship, he screamed so loud, the neighbors complained. First person in our family to go to university. He was blowing with pure joy and pride. His community college graduation was May 20th. Then Howard in the fall. I took my first vacation day in three years. Bought a new dress from the department store, got my hair done professionally. I wanted to look perfect when they called his name. Sean had his speech memorized. Practiced it every morning in the bathroom mirror. The night before graduation, Desean was trying on his cap and gown for the hundredth time, practicing his walk across an imaginary stage. I was making his favorite dinner, my grandmother's fried chicken recipe. We stayed up late talking about Howard. He hugged me tight and said, and tomorrow is our day, Mama. We made it. That morning, Deshawn woke me up at 6:00am, grinning ear to ear. Graduation day, he yelled. We had breakfast together. He put on his suit, and I took pictures of him in his cap and gown. He left early to get to the venue and practice his speech one more time. I was driving to the ceremony alone, singing along to the radio, when my phone rang. It was the hospital Miss

My 16 year old Sophie had been begging for AirPods Pro all summer, the new 300 dollar model. She'd researched every feature, watched countless unboxing videos, even created a detailed comparison chart showing why the Pro version was essential for her aesthetic. Her birthday arrived and I surprised her with the exact model. I was so proud finding them in stock when they'd been sold out everywhere. Her face dropped the second she opened the box. Um, these are the regular AirPods Pro. She held them like they were defective. I specifically said I need the AirPods Pro Max. Everyone at school has the Max version now. These make me look poor. The Max version. This kid wanted the $600 over ear headphones that cost more than my car payment. Her music career consisted of making 15 second TikTok dance videos to trending songs. The Pro version has the same sound quality I explained trying to salvage the moment. These are what actual musicians use for professional work. Mom, nobody cares about sound quality. It's about the look. These tiny earbuds are so basic. The max ones are a statement piece. Was already putting them back in the box. Can you just return these and get the right ones? It's only like 300 bucks more. Only 300 bucks more. Like I was made of money that's stung deep. I'd specifically researched which model music professionals recommended. I'd read reviews, compared features. Even asked my friend who works in audio production. I'll think about it, I said quietly, taking the box from her. She was already back on her phone. Thanks, mom. You're the best. Make sure you get the space grey ones, not silver. Silver looks cheap on camera. I just nodded and walked away. Next day, I'm at Apple store standing in the return line, still feeling terrible about the whole situation. The line was moving slowly and I could hear the customer service conversation happening ahead of me. I'm sorry, ma'am, your card was declined again. Do you want to try a different payment method? I looked up from my phone. A woman about my age wearing scrubs with Maria embroidered on them was standing there with her teenage son. He couldn't have been older than 15, wearing a faded band T-shirt and holding her hand supportively. Um, let me try this one, Maria said, pulling out a different card. Her hands were shaking slightly. Sorry, Miguel. I thought I had enough after paying rent. This one declined too, the employee said gently. The boy immediately stepped forward. It's okay, mom. I don't really need new earbuds for school. My old ones still work fine for online classes. Maria's shoulders sagged like someone had just crushed her dreams. Miho, you've been using those broken earbuds for two years. The left one doesn't even work anymore. And you need them for your virtual music lessons. Maybe next month I'll have Better tips from work, she said, her voice cracking. Your music teacher said you have real talent. You deserve proper equipment. Mom, sharing one earbud with my study group is fine. Besides, my music sounds better when we listen to.

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning, after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day, I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy, and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was. One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night. Just stood in the doorway, clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development. Their church pastor who believed homosexuality was a choice. And for three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires. Just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We Were constantly monitored. No privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One. One night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

The first time I walked in on it, I thought something was wrong. He looked at me all calm and said, I'm just mentally preparing. I've never looked at showers the same way. 2. I found out men treat fridges like treasure hunts. He'll open it five times in a row, stare like something new is going to spawn, sigh dramatically, and then eat plain cheese straight from the block. I once asked why he keeps checking. He said in case a snack magically appears. Three, I didn't know guys hum to themselves during the most random tasks. My boyfriend will be cleaning the sink humming what sounds like boss battle music, then suddenly switched to singing about how this sponge is my sword. I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said, but it still smells like me so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said, because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6, 10. They make sound effects for everything, opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7, they'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8, they'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes. And apparently that's normal to them. 9, they'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car, groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10, they can sit in total silence for an hour staring at the wall. And when you ask what they're thinking about, they say nothing. And somehow they really mean nothing.

After I caught her texting her ex, I didn't say a word. Just walked to the bedroom and started packing. She kept laughing from the couch. You're being dramatic, Michael. It's just texting. I pulled out my laptop, opened my banking app, and started clicking. Her laughter died when she heard the notification sounds. What are you doing? Still silent. Removed her from my car insurance. Cancelled her phone plan that I paid for. Click. Change the Netflix password she used Daily. Michael, stop. This isn't funny anymore. But I wasn't done. Logged into our shared Spotify account, change the password. Then Amazon Prime, then Hulu, then Disney Plus. Every single subscription she used but never paid for. Even changed the Wi Fi password on our router. Are you seriously going through every account right now? Next, I opened my credit card app, removed her as an authorized user. Then my gym membership cancelled her guest privileges. My Costco card revoked her access. This is insane. You're being psychotic. I grabbed my suitcase and headed for the door. She jumped up, panic setting in. Wait, where are you going? You can't just leave! Finally spoke. You asked what I was going to do. I'm showing you my phone. Buzzed Uber outside. Michael, I'm sorry. It meant nothing. Then neither does this. I walked out. The Uber driver was cool. Helped me load my stuff without asking. Questions. We drove away. I saw her standing in the doorway, still holding her dead phone, realizing she couldn't even connect to Wi Fi to call for help. Twenty minutes later, my phone exploded. Her number was already disconnected since I'd canceled the plan, but her friends started texting me. She's crying at Starbucks because she can't call an Uber without her phone plan. She tried to drive home, but remembered you took her off insurance. He's asking everyone for Netflix passwords because she was watching a show. She went to the gym, and they wouldn't let her in. Then came the really good stuff. Her sister called me. Michael, what did you do? Madison's at my place having a complete meltdown. I did exactly what she suggested. She says you cut off everything. Her phone, insurance, streaming accounts, gym access. That's petty. Petty is texting your ex behind your boyfriend's back for two months. Two months? She said it just started. I sent her sister a screenshot of the oldest text I'd found from March. It was now may. Oh, my God, Michael, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. Her sister called back an hour later. She's been lying to everyone. I read through more of those texts. She was planning to leave you. I know. Right after her ex said he wasn't ready for a relationship. So you were her backup plan. Exactly. Keep me around for bills while pursuing him emotionally. The next day, I got A call from an unknown number. Madison using her mom's phone. Michael, please.

I woke up to my teenage daughter Kayla's piercing screams. I ran into her bedroom and couldn't believe what I saw. She was completely bald, her blonde hair scattered across her pillowcase. She was sobbing, telling me her little sister Reese must have shaved her head while she was sleeping. She stumbled to the bathroom mirror and started screaming even louder when she saw her collection. Problem was in eight hours, and she was supposed to be a shoe in for Queen. Now it was ruined. Where's Reese? I demanded. And my husband found her sitting on her own bed in her unicorn pajamas with his electric razor on her nightstand. Reese, what did you do? I asked, trying not to scream while Kayla sobbed in the bathroom. I had to stop her from going to prom, Reese said in that small voice she uses when she knows she's in trouble but thinks she did the right thing. This was my baby, who still crawled into Kayla's bed during thunderstorms. The same little girl who Kayla taught to ride a bike last summer. The one who followed her big sister everywhere, asking endless questions about everything. I couldn't believe she would sabotage her sister's big night like this. Before I could respond, the doorbell rang. Kayla's boyfriend, Steven, let himself in like he always did on Saturday mornings. He. He Came upstairs calling about corsage colours, and stopped dead when he saw Kayla's bald head. What the hell happened to your hair? He asked, and quickly rearranged his face into concern. Baby, don't cry. We can fix this. Maybe get you a nice wig. You'll still be the prettiest girl there. Kayla was crying harder now. Steven pulled her against him while glaring at me like this was my fault. Did Reese do this? I always said that kid was weird. This is assault, Missus Adams! Reese appeared in the bathroom doorway, still in her unicorn pajamas. I cut off all her hair so she couldn't go to prom with you because you're mean to her, Reese! I yelled, but she kept talking in that determined little kid voice. You hurt my sister all the time, Devin. I see the purple marks on her arms where you grabbed her too hard. The bathroom went silent. Steven laughed, but it sounded forced. Kids make up crazy stories, Missus Adams. Tell her, Kayla. Tell your mom how good I am to you. Kayla wouldn't look at anyone. I felt ice spreading through my chest. I took pictures on Mommy's phone when Kayla was sleeping, Reese said, her voice getting stronger. You push her into walls, you hit her tummy where nobody can see. Then you buy her presents after so she won't tell. I pulled out my phone with shaking hands and opened my photos. There they were, close UPS of Kayla's Arms with finger shaped bruises. Her ribs with dark purple marks. I felt my stomach drop. Oh my god, I whispered. Kayla, is this true? Steven's face was getting red. Those could be from anything she plays.

As I walked across the stage alone, my phone buzzed. A text from my dad, you owe us an apology. Plus 37 missed calls. I didn't expect to graduate alone, but the empty chairs in the family section told me everything. Before I even walked across the stage, my name echoed through the auditorium. Applause blurred into static, and I gripped my diploma like a lifeline. Then my phone buzzed. A text from my dad, you owe us an apology. Followed by 37 missed calls. Apologize for what? For working three jobs to get here? For not being born? My sister, Claire. The air outside smelled of cut grass and balloons. Sat by a fountain alone, rereading that text until the words burned into me. Apologize. My parents hadn't just skipped my graduation. They had scheduled my sister's baby shower on the same day. And every time I brought it up, they brushed me off. Ryan, this is once in a lifetime for your sister, my dad said. You'll have other ceremonies, my mom added. That morning, I'd still held out hope. I kept checking the parking lot. Nothing. Not a single familiar face. Instead, I got told to apologize. When I finally went home, the living room looked like a pink explosion. Balloons, confetti, pastel mountains of baby gifts. Claire sat on the recliner like it was a throne. She didn't even look at Me? Did you bring something for the baby? We're still accepting gifts. I had nothing left after scraping together money for a graduation suit. No flowers, no balloons. Just the quiet hope that maybe my family would understand. Instead, my mom cut me off. Ryan, your attitude is unacceptable. We had to choose, and we chose your sister. She needed us more. I whispered. I needed you, too. My dad's face hardened. Walking across the stage isn't the same as bringing life into this world. Be grateful we're even celebrating you now. Claire laughed. Don't sulk. You'll get another graduation when you do your masters. This one was just practice. That was it. I left. The following weeks were worse. Relatives whispered about how selfish I was for missing her shower. At a barbecue, my uncle chuckled. You really should have been there for your sister. Months later, I tried again. My grandmother asked me to visit. I walked into the house to find another baby shower underway. The second shower. And the first words out of my dad's mouth were, you weren't invited. This is for family. Claire smirked. It's fine, dad. He can stay. Make himself useful. The gifts are heavy. I hauled boxes from the car while relatives whispered. He skipped the first shower out of jealousy. Poor Claire. The breaking point came with dessert. My dad tapped a glass. Claire, there. We are so proud of you. You've brought this family together. In a way, nothing Else ever has. You've given us purpose. Then he turned to me. Ryan, maybe one day you'll understand what it means to put family above yourself. Until then, we'll keep praying for you. The applause was thunderous. I stood there. Diploma erased. Years of sacrifice erased. While my family clapped for the daughter who had never lifted a finger. Something snapped. I didn't yell. I didn't argue. I just.

I saw my six year old daughter standing outside, freezing in the snow. I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently in just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key. Fury building with every, every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's Pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly. This whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me. He Picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear. From rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialled a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine, it's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we

The doctor said she had four months with brain cancer, so when she asked to try cigarettes and wine, I figured why not? She's 16 and dying. Normal rules don't apply. We spent three weeks bonding on the back porch. She'd smoke these little cigarettes I bought her and we'd split a beer while talking about everything she'd never get to do. It was beautiful. In this twisted way, she seemed more relaxed than since the diagnosis. Those evenings became sacred to us. She'd tell me about boys she had crushes on but never got to date. We'd talk about college majors she'd researched but would never pursue. She wanted to study marine biology, said she'd always dreamed of swimming with sharks. The irony wasn't lost on either of us that she was more afraid of living than dying. I watched my wife struggle with what we were doing. She'd see us through the kitchen window and her face would crumble, but she never said anything. How do you argue with a dying kid's last requests? How do you be the parent who says no when time is running out? She started taking longer shifts at work, I think to avoid watching us slowly poisoning ourselves. My daughter started sleeping better. The constant anxiety that had consumed her since the diagnosis seemed to fade. With each cigarette, she'd lean against my shoulder and we'd just sit in comfortable Silence, watching the sunset. I memorize those moments knowing I'd replay them forever after she was gone. She told me things during those sessions that broke my heart. How she felt guilty for being sick, how she worried we'd spend all our savings on treatments that wouldn't work. She was scared of the pain, but more scared of leaving us behind. I held her while she cried, both of us smoking and pretending it was helping. The strangest part was how normal it felt after a few days. This was just what we did now. Father, daughter bonding over beer and cigarettes because the universe dealt us the worst possible hand. The next morning, Dr Martinez called while we were having breakfast. She put it on speaker like always, turning the volume all the way up. He sounded strange, like.

I had to choose. I'm at work on a Tuesday morning when my wife texts, having contractions. Think this is it. Meet you at Memorial Hospital. I'm grabbing my car keys when my phone rings. It's my twin sister, and she's sobbing. My water just broke. I'm scared. I'm headed to Valencia Hospital. Please come. I freeze in the parking lot, holding the phone up to my ear. My wife is 39 weeks pregnant with our first baby. My sister is only 34 weeks, making this a high risk pregnancy. And her boyfriend left her two months ago after they found out the baby has down syndrome. The hospitals are 45 minutes apart in opposite directions. I stand there like an idiot while the two most important women in my life need me in two different places. I drive toward my sister first because she's alone and high risk. I call my wife from the car. When I tell her, she's crying, but says she understands. My sister texts, contractions getting stronger. Nurse says I'm 4 centimeters dilated. I think back to when my sister held my hand through our dad's death when we were 16. She's been there through my depression, my divorce from my first marriage, everything. She chose me as her birth partner months ago when her boyfriend bailed. My wife texts, contractions five minutes apart now. Then I'm scared, too. Then we promised We'd do this together. My wife has an anxiety disorder and she's been planning this birth for three years. The playlist, wrote letters to the baby. We practice breathing exercises every night. I'm driving when my breathing starts coming in faster and my hands are shaking so bad I swerve into the other lane. A truck horn blares and I yank the wheel back, nearly going off the road. I have to pull over on the highway shoulder just so I can gasp for air. Full panic attack. Head and hands on the steering wheel trying to breathe. My phone explodes with calls. I answer them one by one. My mother in law is screaming, we just got to the hospital. Where are you? How dare you leave her right now? My father in law texts, get back here now. Man up and support your family. Then my mom calls, we're getting on a plane, but that's five hours away. You need to step up as her big brother. Your sister has nobody. The baby might not survive. My dad texts, blood comes first. Your wife has family. Your sister has no one. I sit there for a moment longer, breathing. Then I call both hospitals. My sister's nurse says she's asking for you. She's terrified. My wife's nurse told me she's progressing fast. Where are you? My phone's at 5% battery from all the calls. At this point, the last thing I hear is my mother in law saying If you're not here when that baby comes, don't bother coming home. My phone dies right there in my hands, still vibrating. With another call coming in. I choose to go to my sister because she's alone and at higher risk. I speed toward her hospital, crying the whole way. I run into the emergency room, asking for her delivery room. The nurse looks confused.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight. Be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly, and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I turned onto our street, there was a black Infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walking up like he'd done it before. Becca opened. Before he could ring, they kissed. The kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too. I needed to do something else. Something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe. How was your night? Good. You know how it is. The next two Thursdays, I kept my routine, but part down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage, and that's when it hit me. The man was Mark. Mark, who supposedly moved to Seattle two years ago. My Knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped the bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for Boys Night, when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Yeah, Mark was great. You guys still text, though, right? Sometimes. The next morning, she woke up different, with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors. And since it was Thursday, during lunch she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew. The comment about Mark got her. Probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old after work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then picking it back up at 7:15. She practically pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time there was no car that showed up. And at nine fifteen, becca's own car pulled out. I followed her. First stop, o'malley's sports bar, where she thought i'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused. Check, taking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop? The dugout, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress, who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar, talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone. Probably my picture. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly Prime Sports Bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms, heard her say every

My husband came home from work last Tuesday with this look on his face that I knew meant trouble. He'd been on the phone with his ex wife all afternoon about Caleb, his 24 year old son. Caleb had overdosed again, fourth time this year. And this time they found him passed out in some gas station bathroom with a needle still hanging out of his arm. I was making dinner when my husband sat down at the kitchen table and just stared at me. My daughter Emma was upstairs doing homework, completely unaware of what was about to happen. He cleared his throat and said they needed $30,000 for an impatient rehab programme, 60 days, some fancy place up in the mountains that supposedly had better success rates. I stopped stirring the pasta sauce and turned around $30,000. We'd already blown through almost $14,000 on outpatient programs that didn't work because Caleb either didn't show up or relapse the second he got out. I'd personally paid a thousand bucks for his first detox. Maybe this time would be different. Then my husband paid 6,500 for another program. Then we split another sixty five hundred when Caleb swore on his dead grandmother's grave that he was ready to get clean. But here's the thing about Caleb. He stolen my wedding ring, my mother's jewellery, our t v, Emma's laptop and even loose change from Emma's piggy bank. The kid Had no problem looking a 15 year old girl in the eye and taking her birthday money. And every time it was the same story. He was sorry. He was gonna change. He just needed one more chance. So when my husband said they wanted to use Emma's college fund, I actually laughed, not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe he was serious. That money came from Emma's dad who died when she was 6. Her grandparents had been putting money in there since she was born, $180,000 that was meant to get her through whatever college she wanted without debt. Emma's crazy smart, like scary smart. Her teachers keep telling me she could get into Harvard or Yale if she keeps her grades up. But even with scholarships, those schools cost a fortune and our incomes too high to qualify for financial aid. That money was supposed to be her safety net, her ticket to whatever future she wanted. I told my husband absolutely not. The fund was off limits, period. That's when he lost it, started yelling about how I was choosing money over his son's life, how addiction was a medical condition, how we had a moral obligation to help family. He kept saying medical emergencies come before education, like Emma going to college with some luxury instead of her entire future. The worst part happened three days later. I came home from work early and found my husband and Emma sitting at the Kitchen table. She looks like she'd been crying. And there were all these pamphlets spread out about the rehab place. My husband had asked her directly if she'd be willing to give up 30,000.

Twice. So I let go completely. Two years later, I walked into that house party with a crowd that left her absolutely stunned. Regina ended it twice. First time at her apartment after dinner. I need space. You're always here, always texting, always needing to know where I am. Second time, when I tried to fix things a month later. You're too clingy. You have no life outside of us. That word destroyed me. Clingy. Like loving someone completely was a character flaw. Three days later, she was already posting stories with hunter, one of our mutual friends from the group. The same hunter who'd been at every game night, every birthday, every random Tuesday hangout. They weren't even subtle about it. Same coffee shop we used to go to, same booth, same drinks. Except now hunter was sitting where I used to be. Our entire friend group just rolled with it. Hunter and Regina just clicked. They'd say like I'd never existed. Like three years of being part of their circle meant nothing. Lorelai, who I helped move twice, suddenly couldn't text back. Graham, who'd crashed at my place countless times, acted like we'd never met. They chose sides without anyone asking them to. Was completely alone. No girlfriend, no friends, no weekend plans, no one to text stupid memes to. So I did the only thing I could. Started saying yes to everything. Coworker mentioned. A hiking group. Yes. Random gym buddy. Invited me to trivia night. Yes! Neighbor needed someone for their recreational basketball team. Absolutely yes. The hiking group LED to Anna, Declan, and Carlos, three people who actually wanted to hang out. Trivia night introduced me to an entire crew of movie nerds who did weekly screenings. Basketball connected me to guys who grabbed beers without making it feel like an obligation. Within six months, I had three different group chats going. Multiple invites every weekend. Inside jokes with people who didn't know Regina existed. He knew me as the guy who was always down for whatever, not the clingy ex who got dumped while I was building an actual life. Regina and hunter were imploding. According to Instagram, their posts went from constant to sporadic. Couple photos replaced with solo shots. Hunter's friends would occasionally mention drama when I ran into them. She's jealous of everyone. Can't handle him having other friends. Sound familiar? A year and a half in, I met Zoe at a concert my new friends dragged me to. She was there with her roommates, dancing like nobody was watching. We talked between sets about the most random things. She collected vintage postcards, had opinions about every food truck in the city, made me laugh until my sides hurt. When she asked for my number, she said it was because I seemed like someone with good friend group energy. Four months of dating before the universe decided to be hilarious. Her roommate Rachel was dating Someone named Graham? Yeah, that Graham. My former friend who'd ghosted me when Regina chose hunter. When Zoe mentioned meeting Rachel's boyfriend's

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together. I've been playing husband since year two. Paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent, while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down. Tears in her eyes, hand on her heart. Then some perfectly rehearsed excuse. We're not ready, let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal number five. And she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time. Convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere, and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it. When she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew. And she didn't even let me finish the speech. Just shook her head with this pitying smile. Like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke. Asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant. And the mask Came completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said, voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place? Eight years of building a life together. I was supposed to know my place? Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I'd spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. She didn't even notice until lunch, when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working. She texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said, I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic started. Creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night, acting extra sweet, made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said, kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

My sister called me a bad mom until her kid told me the truth. When Emma asked if she could dye her hair blue for her 13th birthday, I said, sure. It's just hair, right? She'd been begging me for weeks, showing me Pinterest photos of these gorgeous ocean blue highlights. At target, we picked out some semi permanent dye that would wash out in a month. She was so excited, she could barely sit still while I painted the streaks in our tiny bathroom. The next morning at breakfast, she kept flipping her hair and grinning at herself in the toaster reflection. I made her favorite blueberry pancakes, and she kept saying how the blue and her hair match the berries perfectly. It was honestly the happiest I'd seen her since her dad moved out last year. But when we showed up at my sister Beth's house for Sunday dinner, everything went sideways fast. Beth took one look at Emma, and her face just dropped. He pulled me into the kitchen while Emma was playing with her cousins and started going off about how irresponsible I was being. What kind of message does this send? She whispered harshly, gesturing toward the living room. She's going to look like some delinquent at school. I tried explaining it was just temporary hair dye, that Emma was still getting straight A's and playing violin, but Beth wouldn't hear it. She kept shaking her head and muttering about How I was clear really struggling as a single mom and needed to set better boundaries. The whole dinner was awkward after that, with Beth making passive aggressive comments about certain parenting choices every time Emma's hair caught the light. When we got home that night, Emma seemed deflated. She kept touching her hair and asking if I thought it looked stupid. I reassured her it looked amazing, but I could tell Beth's reaction had gotten to her. That's when I decided to call my mom to vent about the whole thing. Mom listened patiently while I ranted about Beth being judgmental. Then she got quiet for a moment. Honey, she said carefully, there's something you should probably know about your sister's situation. Apparently, Beth had been calling.

My college girlfriend's family owned half the restaurants in our city. Their house had more bathrooms than my apartment building had units. The first time I went to dinner there, I counted three different forks at my place. Setting in panic, her dad, Mr Richardson, made it clear from day one that I wasn't good enough for his daughter. What does your father do? He asked. During that first dinner, when I said he was a mechanic, the temperature in the room dropped 10 degrees. For months, I tried to fit in. I bought clothes I couldn't afford, Learned about wine I'd never drink again and pretended to understand their conversations about vacation homes and stock portfolios. I was drowning in debt just trying to keep up with their lifestyle. The breaking point came at Sarah's birthday party. Her parents threw this massive event at their country club. I showed up in my one good suit, feeling like a fraud among all the designer everything. Mr Richardson introduced me to his friends as Sarah's little project. That's when I snapped. I stopped trying to impress them. I started being myself again. The guy who worked two jobs, ate ramen for dinner and fixed his own car if they didn't like it. Tough. The weird thing, Sarah's younger brother, Marcus, started hanging around me more. He was 16, rebellious and clearly tired of his family's expectations while everyone else was networking. And name dropping, Marcus and I would sneak off to play video games in his room. One night, Marcus asked if I could teach him to change his car's oil. Dad just pays people to do everything, he said. I wanna actually know how stuff works. So we spent the weekend in my tiny garage getting our hands dirty and talking about real life. A few weeks later, Mr Richardson called me, not Sarah, me directly. I need to speak with you, he said in that cold voice I'd grown to hate.

When I was in ninth grade, I got stuck with our school's worst teacher, who was infamous for trying to make a Muslim girl take off her headwear to prove she wasn't wearing headphones in class. There were a lot of students who got away with cheating by wearing headphones during tests, so she was constantly checking. Since then, she didn't do anything too bad until we had to take our final exam at the end of the year, and she stood up to walk around the room. It was really hot that day, so I wore a lighter shirt. I also happened to have type 1 diabetes, so you could see my insulin pump. That day, my blood sugar was low, so I turned my pump on and walked into class. We were almost done taking the test, and she stood up to walk around the room. I was honestly focused on just passing until I heard her walk straight up behind me. In that moment, two things happened. She grabbed my paper off my desk and told me I failed, and I felt her grab the pump on my waist. I just sat there in shock as she walked away and had no idea what had just happened. However, it wasn't until I noticed she was holding Scissors that it clicked what she had just done. She had seen the wire. Hanging off my waist and assumed I had headphones in. When I looked down, the tube was cut. After a few seconds, my pump started beeping very loudly and everyone started looking at me. A few people sitting around me saw what happened and were in shock. She came over and when she realized what she did, I watched her face turn pale. She had messed up big time and had no idea what to do, and neither did I. She told me to go to the nurse, and on the way there, I started getting. I made it there. I could feel myself starting to pass out. The nurse called 9 1 1 and I had to go to the hospital. But since that day, I actually started wearing headphones in class because none of the teachers would try anything.

The compensation was $800 plus a hotel voucher. This businessman in an expensive suit storms over and taps my shoulder. Hey, you should volunteer. I have a million dollar deal closing tomorrow. I politely told him I had an important interview and couldn't give up my seat. His face turned red. Do you know who I am? I fly first class every week. You look like you could use that $800 more than I need this hassle. I said no again and put my headphones back on. But he wouldn't let it go. He sits down right next to me. Listen, I'm trying to be nice here. That interview can be rescheduled. My deal can't. I told him he didn't know anything about my situation and asked him to leave me alone. He laughs and pulls out his phone. What company? I probably know the CEO. I. I can make one call and get you a better position. I ignored him completely and moved to a different seat across the gate area. He actually follows me and sits down again. You're making this harder than it needs to be. I'm offering to help you out here. Other passengers started noticing this guy literally following me around the gate area. He starts talking loudly to anyone who listen. Can you believe this? I offered to compensate him personally. And he's being completely unreasonable. A woman with kids nearby asked him to keep it down because he was being, he turns to her and says, ma'am, I'm trying to solve a problem here. Then he goes back to the gate agent and I hear him say, that guy over there refuses to volunteer. Can't you just bump him instead? The gate agent explains that's not how it works and they need actual volunteer. He storms back over to me with this entitled smirk, fine. The gate agent suggested I negotiate directly with passengers. I told him the gate agent definitely didn't say that and he was lying. His voice gets even louder. I've been flying for 20 years and I've never met someone so stubborn. Now half the gate is watching this spectacle he's creating. He pulls out his business card and waves it around. I'm a senior partner at Donaldson and Associates. Look it up. Nobody cared about his business card, but he kept waving it anyway. Then he starts approaching other passengers, asking if they'll volunteer and pointing at me saying, he won't do it, so maybe you will. This college kid tells him, dude, leave him alone. You volunteer if it's so important. Snapped back, I'm in first class. They can't bump me. It has to be someone from economy. The college kid laughs and says, then deal with it like everyone else. He's getting more aggressive now, pacing around the gate area and complaining loudly. To anyone who'll make eye contact. Then he pulls out his wallet. Fine, I'll give you 1,000 cash right now.

I replied, follow your heart. Then I called her bestie, who'd been crushing on me for years. My girlfriend's reaction when she saw us at her favourite restaurant was priceless. Scarlett and I had been together for years. I was planning to propose next month. Already had the ring and her dad's blessing. Then Ben texted her ex, who ghosted her after graduation to find himself in Thailand, left her crying with packed boxes two years ago. I think I need to explore this, he says, staring at her phone dreamily. Give him another chance. I owe it to myself. Four years of helping her through law school, her dad's heart attack, everything, and she wants to throw it away for someone who already abandoned her. Follow your heart, Scarlet, I said quietly. She looked shocked. You're not going to fight for me. You just told me you want your ex back. What's there to fight for? She met Ben Friday night at some trendy bar. Came home at 2:00am, makeup smeared, hair messy, reeking of his Cologne. We just talked. She lied to my face. Here's what Scarlett didn't know. Her best friend, Paige, had been crushing on me since day one. Told me drunk. At Scarlett's birthday last year, Paige texted, heard about Ben. You okay? She's basically dating him while I pay rent. That's garbage. You deserve better. Want dinner Thursday? Bella Court at 8. Bella? Court, Charlotte's obsession, her favourite restaurant where she Instagrammed every visit. She made her choice time. I made mine. Thursday came. Scarlett left to meet Ben. I picked up Paige, looking running in a black dress. We got Scarlett's usual corner table by the window. Halfway through appetizers, my phone exploded. Are you serious right now, Paige posted from bellacort. That's our place. How could you take my best friend there? I showed Paige the messages. She laughed and raised her wine glass to new beginnings. I got home at eleven PM to find Scarlett pacing the living room like a caged animal, practically wearing a path in the carpet. Ben was sprawled on my expensive leather couch scrolling his.

A few weeks ago, my best friend, Courtney, called me sobbing. I lost my baby Kate exactly 10 weeks ago. My stomach dropped. Courtney had miscarried four times now, all at precisely 10 weeks. I'm a nurse practitioner. That timing pattern doesn't occur naturally. I drove straight to her house where her husband, Joe answered looking exhausted. She's resting. This one hit her hard. I need to see her maybe tomorrow. Joe, I'm her best friend and I'm a nurse. Let me help. He reluctantly let me in. Courtney was in bed, pale and Huggy. When I hugged her, I noticed bruising on her inner arm, fresh needle marks, multiple injection sites. Courtney, these marks. She looked confused. I don't remember getting any shots. I just, I woke up with them after I blacked out last night. You blacked out? Joe interrupted us from the doorway. She faints sometimes, stress from the pregnancy. Three days later, Courtney was feeling better. We met for coffee. I've been thinking, she said. I never actually saw my regular OBGYN during any of my pregnancies. Joe always said he found better specialists. That seemed wrong. Doctor Holly, you've seen her for years. Joe said she was too busy. He'd take me to appointments, but I'd always feel so drowsy in the waiting room. He'd go in to talk to the doctor. While I rested in the car, I called Doctor Holly's office. That afternoon, pretending to be Courtney, checking on my records. I need to verify my appointment history for insurance. Miss Roberts, our records show you called to transfer your care elsewhere last year and the year before, always after positive pregnancy tests. That evening, Courtney texted me again. Found something weird. Joe keeps a detailed calendar in his phone. It has all my periods marked and there are red X's. Exactly 14 days after each period starts. Going back three years, 14 days after period starts is ovulation peak fertility. Courtney, does anything happen on the red X days? She thought about it. Around then is when Joe makes me tea. I guess he says it's good for sleep and fertility. I always take it because I'm usually tired and we want to start a family. I was so suspicious that the next day I came over the next day while Joe was at work. That's when Courtney showed me something else. I found this tiny safe in his closet, like the kind doctors use for medications, but it's locked. We tried every code we could think of, but nothing worked. Courtney, think those nights he gives you the tea. What happens after she went pale? I always wake up feeling sore down there, Joe says. We tried for a baby, but I never remember it. My stomach turned. He was drugging her and assaulting her on her fertile days to get her pregnant. Oh, my god. Could the miscarriages Be him, she shot out. I thought back to my medical training. Courtney, does anything weird happen before each miscarriage? Any sort of pattern? She thought about it for a while. Now that I think about it, I get really sick. Days before each one. Way more sick than usual. Her eyes went wide. Joe makes me soup, some special recipe he says helps with morning sickness. Every single time. Every time she yelled. He's insistent I eat it all. We went back to the safe. Courtney remembered something. His ex girlfriend's name was Marie. Her birthday was October 15th. The safe clicked open. Inside were vials of medications, two types, one labelled with a fertility drug code, the other.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggs bells around her mood swings. Year 1 was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids'grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I've forgotten how To enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and be being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Ellen's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Ellen gasp from in the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for.

So my wife Emma came home last Tuesday with that look on her face. You know, the one all guilty and nervous, like she just got caught stealing candy. She sat me down on our ratty old couch and started crying before she even said anything. Turns out she'd been hooking up with her coworker Jake for, like, three months. Three months while I was working double shifts at the warehouse to save up for our anniversary trip to Florida. She kept saying sorry over and over, begging me not to leave her, promising she'd cut all contact with this guy. I just sat there staring at our wedding photo on the coffee table. The one where we're both laughing because my cousin Rick photobombed us making bunny ears. He looked so happy. So stupid. Emma grabbed my hands and asked if I could ever forgive her. And here's where I became a complete psychopath. I looked her dead in the eyes and said yes. I told her we could work through this, that our marriage was stronger than one mistake. All that bullshit you see in movies. But I was lying through my teeth. The next morning, I called in sick to work and drove straight to Jake's apartment. Found his address through Emma's Instagram. She tagged him at some restaurant last month. Dude answered the door in his boxers, looking all confused. I introduced myself as Emma's husband, and Watched his face go white. Then I very calmly explained that I knew everything and that he had exactly 24 hours to quit his job and move out of town or I'd be paying visits to his parents, his ex girlfriend Sarah, who he was apparently trying to win back, and his boss, who definitely didn't know he was screwing around with married co workers. Jake started stuttering about how sorry he was, how it meant nothing. I just smiled and handed him a printed email I'd already drafted to his entire office explaining the situation. Told him this would be sent if he wasn't gone by Thursday. Me meanwhile, at home, I was being the perfect forgiveness husband. Made Emma her favorite pasta dinner, bought her flowers, even suggested couple therapy. She was so relieved and grateful. Kept telling me how lucky she was to have such an understanding Husband. Thursday came and Jake was gone. Just like that. Emma came home from work all confused because apparently he'd quit without notice and moved back to Ohio or something. She kept asking why he just disappear like that. I waited exactly one more week. Let her think we were rebuilding our trust. Then last Friday, I casually mentioned over breakfast that I changed my mind about the whole forgiveness thing. Her face went from confused to terrified in about two seconds. I told her I'd known.

Jess came over to my place Friday night and I could tell something was bothering her by the way she kept sighing. You know what Brittany told me today? She said flopping down on my couch. Her boyfriend is so mysterious and she's obsessed with him. Meanwhile, you texted me 12 times about being nervous for your presentation. The way she said it made me feel like I was some kind of burden. I wish you were more mysterious, more of a challenge. I should have known this would end badly when three weeks later she'd be crying at my door. But that night I just felt hurt and said, fine, I'll be mysterious that night. I usually would have texted her goodnight, but I didn't and it felt wrong not doing it. She sent me three question marks right away and I just wrote back, all good and left it at that. Saturday morning came and normally I text her about my coffee and ask what she was up to, but I kept my phone in my pocket. By noon, she was texting you okay and I just sent a thumbs up, which killed me because I actually wanted to talk to her. Monday was the worst because I got the promotion I've been working for and all I wanted was to call her and celebrate. When we went to dinner that night, She asked about my day and I just said same old while scrolling through my phone even though inside I was bursting to tell her. She leaned across the table trying to figure out what was going on with me. You seem different, she said. Good, different. And the crazy part was she seemed more into me than she had in months, which made me feel powerful but also completely hollow inside. The second week, she started showing up at my place without calling first and cooking these fancy dinners, basically doing anything to crack me open. I can't figure you out anymore, she said. Wednesday night and she sounded excited about it. Britney so jealous. She as I got the mysterious boyfriend Jackpot. I wanted to tell her how dumb this whole thing was and how much I missed just talking to her normally, but I just shrugged and kept watching TV. my dad called because my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery and he was freaking out. I spent three hours calming him down while just sat next to me trying to figure out what was happening. After I hung up, she asked, is everything okay? And I wanted to fall into her arms and tell her everything, family, stuff. I said instead, it's handled. She killed me harder than she had in months and whispered, you're so strong. But I wasn't strong at all. I was just pretending. The third, Thursday night at eleven, PM Jess showed up at my door with her makeup running down her face, shaking.

And I owe $4,200 in back taxes. As if I don't pay immediately with gift cards, the police will arrest me within an hour. Now, here's the thing. I literally just got my tax refund two weeks ago. My accountant, Beth, handled everything perfectly, and I even got money back. So I knew this dude was full of it. But instead of hanging up, something clicked in my brain. My neighbour, Missus Kim, had fallen for this exact scam last month and lost $800. Time for payback. I started crying into the phone. Oh, no, I can't go to jail. My kids need me. The scammer ate it up. He told me to go to target and buy iTunes gift cards worth $2,000 as a first payment. I said I needed an hour to get the money together. First. I called my cousin Jake, who's a cop, told him what was happening, and he said to keep the guy on the line as long as possible. And I started my revenge tour. I called the scammer back an hour later, sobbing. I'm at target, but I'm so confused. Which gift cards do I buy? He walked me through it step by step. I pretended to be This helpless single mom who didn't understand technology. Sorry, can you repeat that? My hands are shaking so bad. For the next 20 minutes, I wandered around target asking him questions. Do I need the physical cards or the digital ones? Cashier is asking for I D. Is that normal? Sorry, my 4 year old is having a meltdown in the cart. Finally, I told him I had the cards. He was so excited. Probably thinking about his commission. I read him the first number.

My husband walked up to my eight months pregnant sister during her baby shower and punched her full force in the stomach. She folded in half and crashed backward into the gift table while 50 guests screamed. I shoved him backwards screaming what is wrong with you? While my mom called 9 1 1 sobbing about assault on a pregnant woman. My dad and brothers pinned my husband against the wall and I was hitting his chest calling him a psychopath while my sister lay on the floor holding her belly and crying that something was wrong. Her boyfriend was checking for blood and everyone was filming while my grandmother was having chest pains from the shock. My aunts grabbed their kids and ran while I dropped beside my sister trying to feel the baby kick but she kept pushing my hands away saying don't touch it hurts too much. The neighbour who was a midwife tried to come help but my sister curled into a ball screaming not to touch her stomach. My uncle was on the phone with his lawyer we needed to press charges for attempted murder of an unborn child while my sister's mother in law fainted and had to be laid on the couch. My sister kept her arms wrapped around her stomach so tight nobody could get close, crying that she could feel something was wrong inside. Look at her Stomach where I hit her. My husband yelled while fighting against the men holding him, and I wanted to kill him until I saw it. A deep dent in my sister's belly that wasn't popping back out. That's memory foam under her dress, not a baby. And I can prove everything she's been doing. I got to my sister before she could stop me and felt around the dent. My hands went numb, pressing against foam edges and Velcro straps where my nephew should have been. She's been buying different sized fake bellies online to fake the progression, stealing ultrasound photos from pregnancy forums and photoshopping her name on them. And scam everyone for $30,000 and medical bills for appointments that never existed because I checked with every OB in the city. I kept pressing on the dented foam while my sister tried to push me away, and everyone started grabbing at her stomach, finding more straps and padding underneath. I followed her after she said she had an OB appointment yesterday, and she went to a bar and drank for 2 hours, then bought 3 more fake bellies at a costume shop downtown. My sister was crying, screaming at him to shut up, but he didn't listen. My grandmother looked like she was about to faint. My husband showed us her laptop from when she'd left it at our house. Search history full of realistic pregnancy bellies and how to fake morning sickness and pregnancy symptoms by week. And What to say at baby shower. But here's why I had to stop this today, my husband said while struggling against my brother's grip, sweat pouring down his face. I saw her at the hospital last week following a teenage patient around the maternity ward. And security footage shows she's been going to the teen pregnancy support group pretending to be pregnant for two months. Our mother was sobbing while my husband showed us screenshots from the hospital cameras.

Within a week, his entire family moved three states away, ghosted me, blocked me, vanished like a coward in a Letterman jacket. But I wasn't going to be a statistic. My parents were furious but weirdly supportive. They helped me finish high school online and I gave birth to my son Tommy over Christmas break with jingle bells playing in the background. Cute, right? Tommy and I basically grew up together. I worked three jobs while getting my nursing degree. Mom watched him when she could. We ate so much ramen that he thought it was a food group. We lived in a tiny shoebox apartment with a couch I bought off Craigslist for $15 and dreams duct taped together. But it worked. By the time Tommy was 10, I was a pediatric ICU nurse. He was this funny, smart, ridiculous little human who made life fun even on two hours of sleep. Then I met Daniel. Daniel's a pediatric surgeon, smart, kind, didn't blink when I told him I had a 10 year old. On our third date, Tommy had a cold and Daniel brought over soup and comic books. I think I fell in love right then. Two years later, we got married and Daniel adopted Tommy. Tommy calls him dad like he was born to Because honestly, he kind of was. We had twin girls three years ago and Tommy is the sweetest big brother, straight a student, star pitcher for his high school and I mean star college scouts come to see him. And last month his team made it to the state championships. I was screaming my lungs out from the bleachers, phone in hand, filming every pitch like a full blown stage, mom. That's when I saw Jake. Same face, just older. He was staring at Tommy like he was.

I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and, and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor role. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three Years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we. I watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for.

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother, so one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his work bench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice. And I apologized over and over. I, I promised I would talk to him, but deep down, I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, I said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

I didn't know guys will just stand in the shower for 10 minutes doing nothing, no water running, just standing there like they're waiting for a download to finish. The first time I walked in on it, I thought something was wrong. He looked at me all calm and said, I'm just mentally preparing. I've never looked at showers the same way. 2. I found out men treat fridges like treasure hunts. He'll open it five times in a row, stare like something new is going to spawn, sigh dramatically, and then eat plain cheese straight from the block. I once asked why he keeps checking. He said in case a snack magically appears. Three, I didn't know guys hum to themselves during the most random tasks. My boyfriend will be cleaning the sink humming what sounds like boss battle music, then suddenly switched to singing about how this sponge is my sword. I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said, but it still smells like me so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said, because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6, 10. They make sound effects for everything, opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7, they'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8, they'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes. And apparently that's normal to them. 9, they'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car, groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10, they can sit in total silence for an hour staring at the wall. And when you ask what they're thinking about, they say nothing. And somehow they really mean nothing.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night, just stood in the doorway clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development, their church pastor, who believed homosexuality was a choice. And for three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp Restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires, just daily prayer sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We Were constantly monitored, no privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature, I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

He was rubbing it in my face. Oh, my God. I should have told you sooner. I feel so stupid. You're not stupid. I am. I fell for it. He's a good manipulator. I need to confront him. Be careful, Sarah. Thank you for telling me. I'm sorry this happened to you. We need to talk about what the bet? What bet? Don't play dumb. I don't know what you're talking about. Ryan told me everything. Ryan's a liar. No, you're the liar. Sarah. Calm down. Calm down. You married me for a bet. So what if I did? So what? Yes. Or what? You ruined my life. How did I ruin your life? You made me believe you loved me. Look at yourself. You look like an ad for antidepressant.

My girlfriend came home at 2:00am with her underwear and dress torn open screaming for me to help her. She collapsed into my arms and I could feel her whole body trembling. She kept throwing up and shaking all over our carpet. I helped her to the couch and got her a glass of water while trying to stay calm myself because I was sure my worst fear just happened. Luna is without a doubt the strongest person I know. She worked as a prosecutor and dealt with assailers, PDF files and slaughterers every day without flinching. But now she looked broken and small, literally rocking on our couch, kept apologizing for ruining my night, which made no sense. And I assured her she did nothing wrong. At the club, some guy had cornered her outside the bathroom when she was alone. According to her, he towered over her, was super muscular and his breath reek of whiskey. He pushed her against the wall and put his hands where they didn't belong while she screamed for help. The music was too loud and her friends were too far away. She tried to fight back but he already had his way with her. The worst part was what happened next. Luna found security and told them exactly what occurred. She pointed out the guy who was laughing with his friends near the VIP section. The bouncer just shrugged and said, what do You want me to do without any witnesses, lady? he leaned in close and told her that the guy was the owner's nephew, so maybe she should just go home and sleep it off and that it probably wasn't that bad. I felt rage building in my chest as Juna explained how the manager said the same thing, how her friends wanted to call the police, but the staff threatened to ban them, all of them, from every club in a 5 mile radius for causing trouble. Literally. Other women at the club whispered that the same guy had done this before, but nothing ever happened. Police protected him because his uncle owned three clubs in the city. Juno was a prosecutor who put criminals away for a living, but even she knew this would go nowhere. Rich guys with connections didn't face consequences for raping women in dark clubs. There would be no cameras in that hallway and no witnesses willing to testify. The system she worked for every day had failed her completely. I held her while she cried and felt more helpless than ever before in my life. I didn't know people who could handle this kind of thing. There was nothing I could do that would touch that man. But then I remembered that my father would know what to do. My dad had spent 30 years working construction in the roughest parts of the city. He knew people from a different world than mine. People who handled problems outside the law when the law wouldn't help. I spent my whole life trying to distance myself from that part of his past, but now I needed it. The next morning while Juno was sleeping, I drove to my parents house. My dad was drinking coffee in the garage like always, surrounded by his tools and old boxing trophies. I told him everything and watched his face go from confused to furious. He sat down his mug so hard it spilled everywhere. You know the guy's name? He asked in a voice I'd never heard before. I showed him the club's Instagram where the nephew was tagged in VIP photos flashing expensive watches and bottles. My dad studied the pictures like he was memorizing every detail of the guy's face. My father made some calls right there in the garage. I could only hear his side of the conversations, but they were short and serious. He used names I didn't recognize and mentioned favours that were owed. When he hung up, he told me to go home and take care of Junah. He said he would handle everything else. Three days later, the local news reported that the club owner's nephew had been found in an alley behind one of his uncle's properties. Both his hands were broken in multiple places. His ribs were all broken, his eyes were swollen and he had a 1,000 dollar bottle of tequila shoved up his bum, the report said. No witnesses came forward and no cameras covered that particular alley, so they couldn't prosecute anyone. The interesting part was what they found in his apartment during.

My billionaire uncle taught me his trick when I turned 25 and inherited his pharmaceutical company. He said, never let them see the real you first. Make them fall for broke you. So I created a fake dating profile as Mike the struggling musician, posted photos in my crappiest clothes, mentioned my time, any studio apartment, and ramen diet. I even got a part time job at Guitar Center to sell the story. I matched with Emma, who seemed perfect. She was studying to be a veterinarian, drove her mom's old Corolla, and always suggested cheap date spots like food trucks and free concerts in the park. She'd split, put every Bill down to the penny, insisting she knew how tight money was for musicians. After three months, I was falling hard. She'd bring me homemade lunches to Guitar Center, saying she made extra and didn't want it to go to waste. Never asked about my music career or pushed me to make it big. She just seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with Broke Mike. Then she started acting strange. She'd disappear for hours with vague excuses about studying at the library. She'd make secretive phone calls and step outside when I was around. Once I saw expensive designer shopping bags in her backseat that she quickly covered with a blanket when she noticed me looking. I was getting paranoid. Was she cheating? Was I just her bro boyfriend while she Had some rich guy on the side. I hired a private investigator thinking she was seeing someone else. The report came back with photos that made my jaw drop. Emma entering a massive mansion with a circular driveway. Emma stepping out of a brand new Tesla Model S. Emma in an evening gown, shaking hands with the mayor at some charity gala. I was curious. Here I was, pretending to be poor to avoid gold diggers, while she was living this secret rich life and playing me for a fool. I confronted her at what I thought was her small apartment near campus. Turns out it was just the guest house on her family's estate. Emma? Who the hell are you, really? She looked terrified and broke down crying. My dad owns the largest chain of veterinary hospitals in the state. My family's worth over $200 million. But every guy I've dated since high school only wanted me to fund their business ideas, introduce them to my rich friends. She wiped her eyes, mascara running. I've been living in the guest house and driving Mom's old car because I wanted to meet someone who'd like me when they thought I had nothing. You're the first person who never asked me for money or tried to impress me with expensive plans you couldn't afford. She looked at my shocked face. Please don't hate me, Mike. I know I lied, but I was just so tired of guys seeing dollar signs instead of Me? That's when I started laughing hysterically. Emma, I need to tell you something about my pharmaceutical company. Her confused expression was priceless. Remember how I said I inherited some money from my uncle? Well, he didn't just leave me money. He left me the entire company. I'm worth about $800 million. We just stared at each other in this ridiculous guest house. Two rich people who'd been pretending to be broke because we were both terrified of being used. She started laughing, too. So you're telling me I've been buying you lunch because I thought you were struggling, while you've been letting me pay because you thought I was a poor vet student. Pretty

He called for a second doctor, then a third. Their hushed conversations in the corner made my stomach drop. Severe preeclampsia. He finally said, we need to deliver today. But there was a complication. The baby's cord was wrapped around his neck three times. Any attempt to deliver naturally would likely put his life in serious danger. But a C section with my wife's blood pressure that high could have put her life at serious risk. The doctors explained our options in clinical terms that felt surreal. Emergency delivery with baby survival rates at 30% or wait for her condition to stabilize with baby survival dropping to near zero. How long do we have to decide? I asked. You don't, Doctor Sin said. I need an answer now. My wife grabbed my hand. Her grip was weak, but her voice was clear. Save him. I looked at the woman I'd loved for eight years, the person who made me coffee every morning, who still left me stupid love notes in my lunch, who was asking me to let her die for someone we've never even met. No, I said. The room went silent. My wife's eyes filled with tears. Save her, I told the doctors. Whatever it takes. They rushed her into Surgery for an emergency C section anyway, the safest compromise they could try. I sat in the waiting room for two hours, fearing that my decision might have cost our son his life to save my wife. When Doctor Sins finally came out, his scrubs showed the toll of the operation. Your wife is.

My friend Katie always had something to say about my face. Every time we hung out, she'd make these little comments like you'd look so much better with just some mascara or I have lipstick that would really help you out. I kept brushing it off because we've been friends since middle school and I figured she meant well. But then came her engagement party last month. I showed up in a nice dress, hair done, feeling good about myself. Katie took one look at me and said, oh, honey, you really should have told me you weren't doing makeup. I would have brought my kit. She said it loud enough for everyone to hear, including her fiance's family, who I was meeting for the first time. I felt my face turn red. Her mom even chimed in saying, Katie's right, dear, a little colour would really brighten you up. I spent the whole night feeling like everyone was staring at my bare face. Katie kept introducing me as her natural friend with this fake sweet smile. That night I texted my sister about it. She was furious and said Katie was being a total jerk. Then she offered to do my makeup for the wedding since she works at Sephora. I told her no at first because I didn't want to be petty. But she convinced me that looking good wasn't About Katie, it was about me feeling confident. Two weeks before the wedding, my sister and I went shopping. We got everything, foundation, concealer, eyeshadow, palettes, the works. She taught me how to do a full glam look that made my eyes pop and my skin look flawless. We practiced three times until I could do it myself. Morning of Katie's wedding, I woke up at 6:00am to start getting ready. I did my makeup exactly like my sister taught me, then put on this stunning blue dress I've been saving for a special occasion. When I looked in the mirror, I barely recognized myself. I looked amazing. I got to the church early and found my seat.

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his work bench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice. And I apologized over and over. I, I promised I would talk to him, but deep down, I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, I said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night, just stood in the doorway clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development, their church pastor who believed homosexuality was a choice. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp Restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires, just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We were Constantly monitored, no privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One, one night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night. Just stood in the doorway, clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development. Their church pastor, who believed homosexuality was a choice. Listen. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires. Just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We Were constantly monitored. No privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One. One night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

When I was 12, my parents had a strict rule. No video games during the week, only weekends. But my friends would get online every night after homework, and I was missing out on everything. My bedroom was directly above the living room, so they could hear every footstep. The PlayStation was in my room, but the second they heard any controller clicking or game sounds, I'd be busted. That's when I discovered something brilliant. The closed captioning setting. I realized I could play games completely silent with subtitles on. No sound effects, no music, no voice acting. Just pure visual gaming with text at the bottom. For two months, I played every night for about an hour after my parents thought I was asleep. I became a master of elf gaming. I'd wait until I heard their TV turn on downstairs, then carefully power up my PlayStation with the volume at zero. I was living my best secret life. Until the night my dad decided to check on me. I heard his footsteps on the stairs and had maybe 10 seconds. Just turn off the PlayStation. It made noise and took too long, so I did the only thing I could. I dove into bed, pulled the covers over my head, and left the game running. He opened my door, and I held my breath, pretending to be asleep. Through my blanket, I can see the light. From my TV screen. Still flickering. That's weird. I heard him mumble. He walked over to my. I was dead. Caught red handed. Game over. But then I heard him say, honey, come look at this.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years and I was supposed to be her maid of honour. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler who said she was being a total bitch. I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my fitness pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee With extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better. And she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

But now the truth came out. I was 22, just started my dream job as a mechanic, when my phone exploded with hate messages. My 16 year old cousin Sarah told everyone I've been sneaking into her room and got her pregnant. Nobody asked for my side. My mom screamed through tears that I was disgusting, asking how she such a monster. Dad just hung up on me. My sister Emma blocked me on everything without a word. Even my grandmother, who practically raised me after my parents divorce, hung up crying, saying she was too ashamed to talk to me. Sarah was the family princess. Straight A's, honor roll, church, youth group leader. Every Sunday, I was the high school dropout. Within 24 hours, the whole extended family had turned against me. My aunt posted these long Facebook rants about protecting our children from creeps hiding in our own family. My uncles were leaving voicemails threatening to beat the hell out of me if they ever saw me again. Cousins I grew up with were sharing screenshots of our old photos with comments like, can't believe I trusted this creep. I waited every single day for police to show up with handcuffs. Every knock on my door made my heart stop. Every unknown phone number sent me into panic attacks, thinking it was detectives or lawyers. I lost everything, piece by piece. A job at The auto shop because I couldn't focus. Kept making stupid mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss Mike, finally sat me down after three months and said whatever was happening at home needed to stay there. But I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment four months later when I couldn't make rent. Moved in with my buddy Jake, who let me crash on his couch. But even Jake started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Dude, where's your family? It's been six months and I've never seen a single relative. Made up lies about them living far away, being busy, having drama. Dating became impossible. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried seeing asked to meet my parents after two months. I panicked and told her they passed in a car accident. She was so sympathetic it made me sick. Second girl saw through everything when she noticed I had zero family photos in my apartment, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. When I couldn't give her a straight answer, she was gone by morning. Holidays destroyed me completely. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call, someone who cared they existed. I drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway. Knowing they were all inside laughing and eating together without me. I finally moved 3 states away to Colorado. And started completely over. New job at a different auto shop, new apartment, new friends who knew nothing about my past. For years I lived like I had no family. Like I just appeared out of nowhere as an adult. Never dated seriously, because I couldn't risk anyone digging too deep into my background. Built walls so high I forgot what it felt like to trust anyone. Then last month, my phone rang at eleven PM. Unknown Colorado number. Which was weird because nobody had

My parents were convinced that earning my own money was bad for me. I was 16 and just wanted to help with my sister's chronic medication. But they insisted work would distract me from my studies to one day become a doctor and save our family. I watched them skip meals to afford it. Mom cleaned houses until her hands cracked and bled, making me feel guilty about them. Look at these, she say, so yours can hold a scalpel, not a mop. Dad worked two jobs and his face would go blank whenever his card got declined. I couldn't afford the things my friends had, new shoes, games, but that was nothing compared to watching them drown. Every dinner came with the same guilt trip. We sacrificed everything so you won't have to. Or my favorite, other kids work because their parents failed them. We didn't fail you. They were drowning in bills but too how to admit it. But my friend's uncle owned a construction company and knew our situation. At a family BBQ, he pulled me aside. Listen, if you need work, show up at 7:00am, he said quietly. Tell your parents whatever. Everyone needs their own money. You never know what's going to happen That Saturday. I told them I got into free sat prep that met every Saturday morning. They were sus but accepted. For two years, I showed up at the construction sites. I showered on the side. And had my friend's uncle bring me my uniform. I saved most of what I earned, only spending money for my sister's medication, leaving it in the medicine cabinet so they think they had an extra refill. They never figured it out. I saved because I felt as if I knew something worse was coming. Well, one Saturday evening, I came home from sat prep covered in concrete dust. I tried to wash off at a gas station. My sister was on the couch groaning and holding her stomach. She looked pale, sweaty and was complaining to our parents. It's just your period, mom said. Maybe something you ate, dad added. I walked over and felt her forehead. She was burning up. We should go to the hospital. No, dad, snap. We're not made of money. Hospitals scam people for simple stomachaches. An hour passed, then two. My sister's groans turned into whimpers. Real tears were streaming down her face. Now I could hear her trying to muffle her cries so she wouldn't bother them. I grabbed my phone to call an ambulance, but then dad snatched it from my hand. Stop being dramatic. We're not wasting money on an ambulance for stomach pain. She'll be fine by morning, dad, look at her. Go study. They took my phone and sent me to my room. I sat at my desk pretending to read while listening to my sister suffer through the walls. Every few minutes, a new wave. Of pain would hit and she'd cry out. My parents turned up the TV. It had been almost three hours. That's when she let out this huge scream followed by silence and a loud crash. I sprinted out to find my sister collapsed on the bathroom floor, curled in the fetal position. Her face was gray now. My parents panicked. Dad immediately carried her to the car while mom grabbed her purse. I snatched my backpack on the way out, knowing exactly what was coming. The emergency room doctor examined her for less than two minutes. Appendix is rupturing. She needs surgery within the hour or it could be fatal. But you see, we grew up in China. Deposit payment is necessary before surgeries. If you don't have it, you're out of luck. Well, the doctor sent my parents to the payment desk on the first floor while nurses prepped my sister upstairs. I followed them down, watching their confidence evaporate as the clerk typed slowly on her computer, 30,000 RMB deposit required before we can begin surgery. My mom's voice cracked. We don't have that much. The woman just looked at her then. I apologize, ma'am, but our daughter is dying.

I've been tearing my apartment apart for three weeks looking for my grandfather's Rolex, the only thing I had left of him after he died, saving every penny for my college fund. My girlfriend, Serena, kept helping me search every corner, acting devastated about how much it meant to me, even crying when we couldn't find it. Then her best friend, Marcus, shows up to our anniversary dinner wearing it on his wrist like it's his prized possession. When I pointed it out, Serena immediately jumped to his defense like she'd been rehearsing. She said Marcus had been working double shifts at the warehouse for months, saving every penny to buy one just like mine. Marcus nodded enthusiastically, spinning some elaborate story about finding a crazy good deal from some desperate guy online who needed quick cash for rent. I didn't say anything. I just smiled and said it looked really good on him, even complimented the band. But something felt completely wrong. The way Serena's voice got higher, more defensive when she explained for him, the way Marcus couldn't look me in the eye while telling his story, the way they kept glancing at each other. That night I called my uncle, who's been a professional jeweler for 30 years. When I described the watch in perfect detail, he went completely quiet. Then he said, kid, that's not just any Rolex. Your grandpa had me personally engrave his Initials inside the band back in 1987. Took me three hours with my finest tools to get it perfect. Next day, while Serena was at her marketing job, I texted Marcus, told him I was really impressed with his watch and wanted to see it up close, maybe get the contact info of the seller since I was thinking about buying another one as a replacement for my missing one. We met at the downtown Starbucks. I complimented the watch extensively, asked about the band quality, the weight, how it felt on his wrist. Then I casually asked if I could examine the clasp mechanism because I was curious about the Pacific model year. Marcus handed it over without any hesitation, probably thinking he was being helpful. Sure enough, there they were, my grandfather's initials perfectly engraved inside the band, RT 1987, the same exact initials I traced with my finger a thousand times as a kid. Sitting on his lap. I took the crystal clear photo of the engraving and immediately texted it to Serena. Funny story about Marcus's brand new watch. Do these initials look familiar to you? Within seconds, my phone completely exploded. Serena calling over and over, texting frantically every few seconds. But she wasn't apologizing or acting shocked. She was defending Marcus aggressively, saying I was being paranoid and controlling, that it was just a weird coincidence and I needed to stop harassing her innocent best friend who worked so hard for that watch. She Knew she'd been in on it from the very beginning and was choosing his side even when caught completely red handed with undeniable proof. But here's the thing my grandfather taught me before he died. When someone steals from you, they.

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, he said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

Her friends in the gallery were practically grinning, waiting for the show. But here's what Lauren didn't know. Six months before I caught her cheating, I'd started noticing weird charges on our joint credit card. Expensive dinners at restaurants I'd never been to, hotel rooms booked During girls trips that didn't add up. Designer lingerie purchases that never made it home. The final straw was when I found an eight hundred dollar charge at a jewelry store downtown. When I asked Lauren

When I was 12, my parents had a strict rule. No video games during the week, only weekends. But my friends would get online every night after homework, and I was missing out on everything. My bedroom was directly above the living room, so they could hear every footstep. The PlayStation was in my room, but the second they heard any controller clicking or game sounds, I'd be usted. That's when I discovered something brilliant. The closed captioning setting. I realized I could play games completely silent with subtitles on. No sound effects, no music, no voice acting. Just pure visual gaming with text at the bottom. For two months, I played every night for about an hour after my parents thought I was asleep. I became a master of self gaming. I'd wait until I heard their TV turn on downstairs, then carefully power up my PlayStation with the volume at zero. I was living my best secret life. Until the night my dad decided to check on me. I heard his footsteps on the stairs and had maybe ten seconds. I couldn't just turn off the PlayStation. It made noise and took too long. So I did the only thing I could. I drove into bed, pulled the covers over my head, and left the game running. He opened my door, and I held my breath, pretending to be asleep. Through my blanket, I can see The light from my TV screen still flickering. That's weird. I heard him mumble. He walked over to my TV. I was dead. Caught red handed. Game over. But then I heard him say, honey, come look at this. My mom's footsteps came up the stairs. I was

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years, and I was supposed to be her maid of honour. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend, she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler, who said she was being a total bitch, but I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my Fitness Pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting Coffee with extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better, and she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

Half an hour later, she came storming in, yelling about how embarrassing it was when her cards got declined, how her friend had to pay for lunch. I was sitting on the couch with voice papers in my lap and boxes beside me. When she stopped yelling, I told her, real calm, yeah, I canceled the cards because you don't need them anymore. That's when she noticed the papers and boxes. I handed her the divorce papers and explained this was her graduation from practice marriage. The look on her face was worth every penny I'd spent on her. Pure shock, then panic, then desperate backtracking. She tried every approach, claiming it was a joke, apologizing, getting angry, making it my fault. But the damage was done. I'd heard exactly what she thought of our marriage. When she tried to argue. She couldn't be kicked out because it was her house, too. I showed her the prenup. You could see her face change as she realized how screwed she was. She signed away any claim to everything.

Haley acted completely normal while I sat there thinking how she basically admitted to using me as a financial safety net. Monday morning, I called in sick, went to my lawyer. Best decision I ever made was insisting on that prenup three years ago. Haley hadn't been happy about it. Kept saying it showed I didn't trust her. Turns out my paranoia was justified. The clean up was straightforward. Anything I owned before marriage stayed mine. Anything I earned during marriage stayed mine. Unless she could prove financial contribution. Since she'd quit working and hadn't contributed financially in two years, she had no claim to the house, savings, or car. I spent the week quietly preparing. Moved money from joint accounts, changed passwords, updated contact information. Haley never noticed because she never paid attention to finances anyway. I had divorce papers drawn up Thursday. Then I waited for the perfect moment. Saturday morning, as soon as she left for brunch with her girlfriends, I called to cancel her credit cards and froze our joint checking account. 30 minutes to cut off the financial pipeline.

I've been married to Haley for three years. Decent marriage, or so I thought. I made good money. She'd quit her job a year after we got married to figure out what she really wanted to do, and I've been supporting both of us ever since. Last Friday, she had her girlfriends over for dinner, like she did every month. I cooked, serve them, then went to clean up. That's when I heard my name and tuned in. Honestly, girls, Anthony's just my practice husband until I find someone better. I literally froze with a plate in my hand. Her friend asked what she meant by practice husband, and Haley started explaining how I was good for now because I paid all her bills and did the cooking, but she wasn't planning to stay with me forever. Said I was fine for practice, but not husband material long term. The problem was she couldn't leave me yet because I paid for everything. All three started laughing like it was the funniest thing ever. What hit me wasn't just what she said, it was how casually she said it. Like obvious accepted fact. She wasn't confessing some secret, just stating the situation, like commenting on the weather. After her friends left, I waited an hour before confronting her. When I asked about the practice husband comment, she acted confused at First, when I spelled it out, her whole demeanor changed. Oh, that? Yeah, I said that.

I didn't yell, I just smiled. The entire table went quiet because they knew that smile meant something was coming. Later, Amanda and mom were giggling in the kitchen. Don't look so serious, mom said. It was just a prank. You're acting like they burned down your house, Amanda said. I worked months of overtime for that laptop. Amanda shrugged. Then buy another one. Dad walked in. Have to let things go. They're just kids. That was it. They weren't going to apologize. Something shifted that night. I'd spent years being the bigger person, but watching Carla cry while everyone laughed broke something inside me. I started thinking about everything I'd done for this family. Bills I'd covered when Amanda forgot rent. Times I'd bailed them out. A month later, mom called. Amanda's in a tough spot. Could you help with rent? The same sister whose kids destroyed a two thousand dollar laptop while everyone laughed? You can't hold on to that forever. No. A week later, I checked my joint emergency account. Nearly $1,800 gone in a transfer to Amanda. I called mom. Why did two grand disappear? Amanda was about to get evicted. That wasn't your money to give.

I've been given three Grace periods in 12 months, I said calmly. Continuing without a payment plan would be a liability. Dad called, furious. Did you tell them to put us on prepaid? We'll go under! Maybe you should have thought about that before you laughed while my kid cried and stole from my account! When Amanda posted about people turning their backs on family, I sent her husband screenshots of her luxury purchases and the stolen money. Amanda called, screaming, how dare you! You went behind mine first! With been months, everything collapsed. Dad's business lost contracts. They sold the house below market value. Amanda's marriage was shaken. Mom finally called to apologize. We laughed when we should have defended Carla. We've paid for it. Amanda showed up weeks later, defeated. You ruined me! You ruined yourself! I just stopped cleaning up after you. That evening, Carla brought me a drawing. A big tree standing tall after a storm, with two figures smiling at the bottom. Looks like we made it through, she said. I framed it and hung it where the melted laptop used to Sit. When my family called to pull me back into their chaos, I didn't answer.

Yesterday, she gave them all back. When Heather was 18, she walked into the kitchen carrying an old Adidas shoebox and said, dad, I need to show you something. She set the box on the counter and lifted the lid. Inside were hundreds of napkins, post its index cards. They were every lunch note I'd ever written her. You kept these? I asked. She nodded. Every single one. I'd started writing them when she was 6. The divorce between her mom and I had been final for two months. Her mom got weekends and holidays. I got weekdays. I meant I did all the school stuff. The problem was, I didn't know how to do school stuff. That first Monday of kindergarten, I packed Heather a peanut butter sandwich, apple slices, and a juice box. She came home talking non stop about everyone else's lunch. Catherine's mom made sushi rolls that look like pandas. And Julie's mom cut her sandwich into a butterfly with cookie cutter. And Joyce had a note from her mom in her lunch box that said, I love you to the moon and back, with a drawing of a rocket ship. Did you like your lunch? I asked. It was fine, she said, but I could tell she was envious. That night, after she went to bed, I stared at her lunch bag. I couldn't make sushi. I didn't own cookie cutters. But I could write I Grabbed a napkin and wrote, you're braver than you know. Love, dad. The next morning, I tucked it under her sandwich. When she got home, she ran to hug me and said, I saw the napkin. Ellie asked if my mom wrote it, and I said, no, my dad did. Nobody else's dad writes notes. I love you, dad. So I kept writing them. At first they were simple. Have a great day, or, you're my favorite person. Then I started adding drawings. Terrible ones. A cat that looked like a potato. A son with sunglasses. Our dog if our dog was made of circles. My first grade, I was writing jokes. What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear. Told me her table laughed so hard, the lunch monitor had to shush them. Second grade, I started writing them based on what was happening before her spelling test. You got this. Those words don't stand a chance. After she'd fought with her friend. Being kind when you're hurt is the hardest kind of brave. Sit down, Heather said that morning in the kitchen. I need to show you how I organized them. She'd separated them into sections with rubber bands and labeled sticky notes. The first bundle said, funny. She pulled one from third grade. Why don't eggs tell jokes? Cracker. Another one had a drawing of me attempting to dance at her recital. This is still the worst drawing you've ever done, she said. Laughing. The next section was labeled Bad Days. These were thicker napkins, longer notes. She pulled one from seventh grade. You are exactly who you're supposed to be. Not who they say you are. Not who you think you should be. Who you are. That hey, Ruth had told everyone I was weird for not having a mom at home. That I was probably weird, too. How did you know? She said that I hadn't known. I just wrote what I wished someone would tell me. She pulled out another bundle. This one made my chest tight. The label said, saved me. This section is from eighth grade. Mostly. She said she pulled out a coffee stained napkin. You're not alone. You never have been. You never will be. Even when I'm not there, I'm there. She showed me another one from that year.

She could come back when she had a real plan. She ran to her room crying and my husband came in asking what all the yelling was about. When I explained, he said maybe I was being too harsh. Emma's always been a homebody and maybe forcing her out wasn't the answer. But I stood my ground. The next day, Emma's grandmother called me screaming. Emma had called her crying about how I was kicking her out for wanting to be a traditional wife. My mother in law went on this whole rant about how back in her day women didn't need careers and how I was being a terrible feminist mother for not supporting my daughter's choices. Then Emma's best friend's mom texted me saying I was wrong for not respecting my daughter's dreams. Apparently Emma had been telling everyone I was forcing her to abandon her values and become some kind of career obsessed woman who doesn't want kids. But that's not what I said at all. I never said she couldn't be a stay at home mom. I said she needed a backup plan. Some kind of skill or education or work experience. Even just working part time at target would give her basic customer service skills and show her what it's like to earn her own money. The whole thing came to a head last week when Emma announced she joined some online matchmaking group for traditional Wives. She showed me this website where women post profiles talking about how they want to be homemakers, and men look for wives who will stay home. Some of these women were 18, 19 years old, talking about how they're looking for older men who can financially support them immediately. I told her she was basically looking for someone to take care of her like a child, not a partner. That set her off again. She screamed that I didn't understand her generation, that I was stuck in some second wave feminist mindset, and that plenty of women choose to be traditional wives. My husband finally stepped in and said we needed family counseling. Emma refused. She said she'd rather move out than listen to some therapist tell her that her dreams were wrong. So I told her, fine, start packing. She's been staying with her grandmother for the past week.

My daughter Emma just turned 18 and graduated high school two months ago. Since she was about 15, she's been talking about how she doesn't wanna go to college or get a job. She wants to find a husband and be a stay at home mom, period. That's it. That's her entire life plan. At first I thought it was just teenage talk, like how kids say they want to be astronauts or YouTube stars. But she's been dead serious about it for three years now. No college applications, no job hunting, nothing. She spends most of her time watching these TikTok videos about traditional wives and reading blogs about homemaking. Last month she came to me with what she called her life plan. She was going to live at home with me and my husband until she found a husband. She figured she'd meet someone at church or maybe through friends, marry them within a year or two, then have kids right away. When I asked what she'd do if something happened to her hypothetical husband, she just shrugged and said she'd move back in with us. I lost it. I told her that wasn't happening. If she wanted to live at home after graduation, she needed to either get a job or go to school. Community college, trade school, something she didn't have to get a four year degree. But she needed some kind of plan that didn't involve sitting around waiting for Prince Charming. She started crying and said I was being mean and that being a mom was a real job. I told her I wasn't saying being a mom wasn't work, but what happens if her husband dies or leaves or gets disabled? What if they can't have kids? What if he turns out to be abusive? She needed something to fall back on. That's when she dropped the bomb. She said her backup plan was literally me and my husband. If anything went wrong, she just moved back home and we'd support her and any kids she might have. I asked what would happen if we died or couldn't help anymore, and she said, I don't know, mom. This is ridiculous. None of it is going to happen. I told her she was being naive and that I wouldn't enable this fantasy. I said if she graduated and didn't have a job or wasn't in school.

I had just been served divorce papers during my lunch break by someone named Sophia, citing abandonment after five years of marriage. The problem was that I had never been married and had definitely never met anyone named Sophia in my entire life. Maybe it's a different Ryan, my coworker suggested as he studied them more carefully. But then his expression changed. This has your Social Security number and your address and your parents names as in laws. I stared at the signature on the marriage certificate attachment, and my blood ran cold because it looked exactly like my handwriting, down to the way I always make my R's too narrow. This has to be identity theft, I said, but my voice sounded shaky. I dialed the law office with trembling hands, trying to explain that someone was impersonating me. The attorney listened patiently before responding, Mister Ryan, I understand this is emotional, but denying your marriage won't make this simpler. And we have extensive documentation, including wedding photos and joint tax returns. I tried to process that they supposedly had wedding photos of me that I'd never seen. Where are you claiming this marriage took place? I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. Vegas, five years ago. You've been living together in the marital home ever since, though apparently you haven't been there for the past two years, she replied. But five years ago, I was living alone in my current apartment. And I had the least to prove it. There must be some mistake. I've never even been to Vegas. I insisted the attorney side. Mister Ryan, your wife has photo albums and five years of documentation. Perhaps you should review the materials I'm sending before making

Three days after Grandpa died, my parents arrived at my door with flowers and a business proposal. They wanted guardianship of my unborn baby. Turns out Grandpa had left behind a trust fund that paid $100,000 a year to whoever raised his great grandchildren. My parents were claiming if I gave guardianship to them, we could all have access to it. It's a win win. They smiled sweetly. They left after I told them I needed time to think. They waited exact three days before going nuclear. I was making breakfast when mom called, crying. The cancer is back at stage 4. Treatment is $80,000 a year, and insurance won't cover it. Two hours later, Annika showed up at my house. She snuck in using the spare key and put her hands on my belly. Before I could react, I had to go through seven years of pain. She whispered, her fingers spreading across my skin like she was claiming territory. Seven years of needles and failure and empty cribs. She swore that with a trust fund, she would give my baby everything I was stressed about private schools, funds, a big backyard to play in. The baby kicked, and I wondered if I was being selfish by keeping her. When you've been trained since birth to put family first, setting boundaries feels like a trail. The breaking point came when mom sent a photo of herself in A hospital bed with an IV in her arm. Starting chemo tomorrow. The caption read. I wish I could afford the treatment that actually works. I arrived to granddad's funeral three weeks later with guardianship papers tucked in my purse. But as the last hymn ended and the funeral director cleared his throat, everything changed. He announced that our grandfather had left specific instructions for this moment.

There wasn't gonna be a 48. Everyone told me I was too lenient with my best friend Kathy, and always made excuses for her when she flaked out on plans to be with her boyfriend. And maybe they were right. I mean, two years ago, she had offered to take me out for brunch after I was feeling down over losing my job, when she suddenly texted me, can't make it. Jake surprised me with breakfast in bed. And the worst part of it was that I was literally already there at our reserve table ordering two mimosas. Then it was the birthday dinner where she showed up 90 minutes late, then left after 10 minutes because Jake asked her to come over. Same thing when I was moving apartments and when my mom was having surgery, and I really needed a friend. And you think that was the final straw, right? No. It wasn't until Kathy flaked out on my mom's no. That I realized I was chasing after someone who clearly didn't want me around like I wanted her. So I stopped inviting her to things, focused on myself, joined a climbing gym, made some new friends, and made space for old friends who actually wanted to be there. And by the time my birthday came around, my dinner table was full of people who cared and made time for me, too. But just as things started turning Around Kathy came back, I was packing up my climbing gear when I suddenly got a flood of texts. Jake cheated on me with crying emojis filled my notifications. I glanced at it, then went straight back to packing. Three more texts came through in rapid succession. Um, hello. I'm literally heartbroken. Then I'm coming over getting wine and ice cream. That only made me pack even faster. My phone rang, and I let it go to voicemail. A text instantly popped up. Are you seriously not gonna be here when I need you? Well, that was ironic. I wasn't sure if I should be angry or amused that she

The whole table stopped eating. I nearly choked on my sandwich because everyone had been thinking something was off, but nobody had said it out loud. She's just helping me with homework, I said, looking around to make sure no teachers were nearby. But Megan was already shaking her head at me. Roger sat down his juice box deliberately and said, stop defending her. She let you turn in your lab report a week late. A week? She gave me a zero for being one day late. I suddenly felt defensive of Miss White. Maybe he had a good reason, I said quickly. She's strict, but she's fair. There has to be an explanation. Megan's voice came out sharp. Roger, what exactly have you seen? Roger pulled out his phone. His movements quick, angry. I made a list. Look at this and tell me this is normal. He showed everyone his notes app. The list made me uncomfortable. Me sleeping in class without punishment. Me eating full meals during lectures. Me getting bathroom passes whenever I wanted. Me staying after school with a key to her classroom. Megan leaned forward, reading everything. This. This does look weird. What's your explanation? An explanation? I insisted. There's nothing to explain. She's just being helpful. Roger wasn't finished. He swiped to another page. This was yesterday. Tell me this isn't suspicious. The photo showed Miss White putting bags in my car after school. I stared at it, my mind racing. This is innocent. She was helping me with something. Helping you with what, exactly?

You're taller, way better than my boyfriend. The crowd cheered. I just left. The next morning, she realized she'd lost more than just me. My girlfriend Maya had this male best friend, Eric, who was always around, always touching her arm, always looking at her like she was his prize. Six months earlier, I'd laid it out clearly. Either put serious distance between you two, or we're done. She cried, promised he was just a friend. And for months, things seemed better. Then came the concert. I busted my ass to get expensive tickets to her favorite band. It was supposed to be our date night. We get through the gates, and the first person I see is Eric, standing there with this smug grin. What's he doing here? I asked, not hiding my irritation. Maya went defensive immediately. Oh, my god! God, Leo, don't start. He got a ticket from a friend. It's total coincidence. The look Eric gave me, that little victorious smirk, told me everything. This was no coincidence. This was a. She lied to me and broken the one promise I made. A deal breaker. But I paid for those tickets, so I decided to just ignore them. Stupid plan. Because Maya and Eric had other ideas. They were all over each other the entire time. Whispering, laughing at inside jokes I wasn't part of. She was putting on a performance, and I was the chump in the background. I wasn't her date. I was just the guy who drove her there. When the headliner came on, the crowd surged forward and Maya started complaining she couldn't see Leo. Let me get on your shoulders, she said, like nothing was wrong. You know I have a bad back, I told her, suggesting we move to the side instead. She gave me a five second pout, then turned to Eric with that bright fake smile.

Mason was six bites in when his face started swelling. Where's your Epipen? I asked. Already checking his backpack. His eyes went wide with panic. Jessica has it. She said she'd bring it. My stomach dropped. Jessica was supposed to meet us at noon. It was 12:17. I called her immediately. Restaurant noise and laughter filled the phone. This better be important. Mason's having a reaction. Where are you with his Epipen? I'm on a date. Finally, after three years. Jessica. He ate peanuts. Throat is closing. Are you kidding me right now?

Every time I try to be happy, something happens. Every single time. At 12:23, Mason collapsed. His lips were blue. A mom at the park, Called 9 1 1 while I held him, feeling his tiny chest barely moving. I called Jessica again. He's unconscious. He's turning blue. Stop being dramatic.

She laughed this loud, ugly sound that cut right through me. See? She shouted, making sure everyone around could hear. You're taller. Way better than my boyfriend. The crowd roared their approval. Eric just stared at me with that same smug, punchable face. He'd won. That's when everything went quiet for me. The music, the crowd. Everything just faded.

Chicken and vegetables. It only cost me three dollars to make, I said. Must be nice to know how to cook, he said while placing another forty dollar dinner order, including delivery fees and tip. I watched his side of the fridge stay completely empty except for energy drinks, while mine was organized with prepped meals and fresh ingredients. How much have you spent on food this week? I asked. I don't even want to look at my credit card statement right now, he admitted, while his phone showed another declined payment notification. The second week, Travis's side of the fridge remained completely empty except for a single jar of pickle juice with no actual pickles in it. Why aren't you buying groceries? I asked while unpacking my weekly haul. Grocery stores stress me out. I don't know what to buy that doesn't need cooking, he admitted. Friday night I came home to find him trying to cook spaghetti Eddie by putting dry pasta in a bowl with cold tap water and microwaving it for 15 minutes. The pasta had started smoking and set off the fire alarm. Travis, what the hell are You doing? I asked, while fanning smoke out the window. The box says cook for eight minutes in water, so I put it in water and set the microwave for eight minutes. It was still crunchy, so I added more time, he explained.

Oh, and Evelyn, if you're still watching this, your parking meter ran out 20 minutes ago. He kept going. And what he said next made my face drain of color. My mother's face went from angry to terrified. Turn it off! She screamed. She doesn't need to know. And after I found out, I was ready to destroy them in the same way they destroyed me. But worse.

He announced that our grandfather had left specific instructions for this moment. Suddenly, the screen behind the casket came to life, and there was a recording of Grandpa propped up in his hospital bed and staring directly at the camera. If my daughter Evelyn is perking up right now thinking this is about trust distributions, he said, and Mom's eager face shifted to confusion, then everything is going according to plan. What none of you know, Grandpa continued, is that I've been recording every conversation in my hospital room for the last six months because I needed evidence. Mom started to stand. This is ridiculous. Evelyn, sit down. Yes, you. I know. You're standing right now about to claim I was senile. She froze midstand and slowly sank back down. You told my granddaughter your cancer returned. Stage 4, right? Experimental treatment that cost exactly what the trust pays annually. Creative math. Mom was frantically scrolling through her phone while dad tried to grab it to see the documents himself. Wesley, are you still claiming you're losing the house? Dad spun toward the screen. The house I paid off in 2008. The remortgage that went straight to Prairie casino. I have the withdrawal records. Wesley. $400,000 in 18 months. Terrible blackjack player, by the way. Annika jumped up, already crying. He was clearly mentally compromised. Ah, Annika. Right on schedule. Let me guess. You're about to cry about your infertility. He chuckled to himself. Your abortion was 14 Months ago, $3,200 on my credit card! Monica screamed. That's a vicious lie! Also, you're not infertile. You're on birth control. The pills are in your medicine cabinet behind the vitamins. The funeral home erupted. Now, Grandpa's voice continued calmly my granddaughter, if you're holding guardianship papers right now, and I know you are, because you always want the best for everyone, read page 4, subsection C, out loud. My hands trembled as I flipped through the pages. Permanent and irreversible transfer of parental

Rebecca called 6 7 times between six PM and midnight. Messages progressed from confused to angry to desperate. She claimed Connor didn't mean it, was just showing off for friends, that I was overreacting to. Typical teenager behavior. I texted back once saying I needed space and would contact her when ready, then blocked her number to avoid the emotional manipulation building in her messages. Monday morning, I contacted my bank and removed Rebecca as joint account holder. Called the mortgage company. Thankfully, my name wasn't on the loan. Rebecca had refinanced in her name only six months before we moved in together. The mortgage was due the first. By the fifth, Rebecca contacted me through a mutual friend with a frantic message explaining she didn't have enough money to cover the mortgage, begging me to reconsider. She claimed she talked to Connor and he was very sorry, wanted to apologize personally. I responded that I appreciated her reaching out, but my decision was final. I'd already put a deposit down on a one bedroom apartment across town. Rebecca's sister called Thursday night saying Rebecca was having panic attacks about potentially losing the house. Tried guilting me about abandoning a single mother and her child. I calmly explained I've been financially supporting them for two years while being treated as an outsider in my own home. Friday evening, Rebecca showed up at my brother's place crying, begging to talk. Against better judgment, I agreed to Speak on the front porch. Rebecca looked like she hadn't slept in days. Admitted she'd been wrong. Undermine my authority with Connor. Gotten too comfortable with our financial arrangement. Offered to add my name to the mortgage. Suggested couples counseling. I listened to everything, then explained the issue wasn't just about chores or Connor's attitude. She created a dynamic where I was expected to provide without receiving respect or having any real say in household decisions. Told her I cared about them both, but couldn't continue being treated like a premium rent paying tenant.

Three days after Grandpa died, my parents arrived at my door with flowers and a business proposal. They wanted guardianship of my unborn baby. Turns out Grandpa had left behind a trust fund that paid $100,000 a year to whoever raised his great grandchildren. My parents were claiming if I gave guardianship to them, we could all have access to it. It's a win win. They smiled sweetly. They left after I told them I needed time to think. They waited exactly three days before going nuclear. I was making breakfast when mom called, crying. The cancer is back at stage 4. Treatment is $80,000 a year, and insurance won't cover it. Two hours later, Annika showed up at my house. She snuck in using the spare key and put her hands on my belly. Before I could react, I had to go through seven years of pain. She whispered, her fingers spreading across my skin like she was claiming territory. Seven years of needles and failure and empty cribs. She swore that with a trust fund, she would give my baby everything I was stressed about private schools, college funds, a big backyard to play in. The baby kicked, and I wondered if I was being selfish by keeping her. When you've been trained since birth to put family first, setting boundaries feels like a trail. The breaking point came when mom sent a photo of herself. In a hospital bed with an IV in her arm, starting chemo tomorrow. The caption read. I wish I could afford the treatment that actually works. I arrived to granddad's funeral three weeks later with guardian ship papers tucked in my purse. But as the last hymn ended and the funeral director cleared his throat, everything changed. He announced that our grandfather had left specific the constructions for this moment. Suddenly, the screen behind the casket came to life, and there was a recording of Grandpa propped up in his hospital bed and staring directly at the camera.

I moved out quietly. I'm 38. Been with my girlfriend Rebecca for three years. She has a 15 year old son, Connor, whose biological father moved states away when Connor was eight. The deadbeat sends maybe $200 monthly when he remembers. Rebecca works part time at a dental office making $30,000 while I pull $95,000 as a project manager. When we moved in together two years ago, I took over her 2 thousand two hundred dollar mortgage payments, plus utilities, groceries and Connor's expenses. Phone, clothes, sports equipment, everything. Rebecca insisted we keep separate finances, which I stupidly agreed to. Looking back, this arrangement only benefited her while I shouldered the financial burden. Connor and I had what I thought was a decent relationship. I never tried replacing his father, but expected base, take respect and help with household chores. Taking out trash, keeping his room clean, weekend yard work. Nothing unreasonable. Rebecca constantly undermined me, saying I was too strict or Connor needed time to adjust. Red flag I ignored. Last Saturday, I was in the kitchen making lunch when Connor's three friends came over. They were hanging out in the living room and Connor was complaining loudly about raking leaves that morning. Our house has thin walls and they weren't keeping voices down. One friend asked why Connor had to do chores when his Mom's boyfriend was home. Connor's response hit like a punch to the gut. My real dad would never make me do chores like this loser. This guy thinks he can boss me around just because he pays for stuff. My mom says I don't have to listen to him anyway. His friends laughed. Once said Connor was lucky having someone pay for everything while doing whatever he wanted. Connor agreed, adding that his mom told him I wasn't going anywhere because I was too.

It's a family event. He'll benefit from the happy occasion. Becky texted a wedding dress photo. Thanks for the deposit money. But even after stealing my son's savings, it wasn't enough. The venue still needed the final balance paid. Then the invitation arrived. Just Mister James plus guest. My son wasn't invited after they stole his savings. Mom said breckie wanted it. Small kids complicate things. After taking his money, he's not welcome. Time you focused on your life instead of being wrapped up in your child. That was the line. I pulled up years of records. Every time I bailed breckie out. Rent payments, emergencies. All documented. Friday, 4:45 p m. I emailed. If payment isn't received and the contract terminates, let me know. I'd like to reserve the venue for a private event. 5:01 p m. Reply? No payment received. Booking canceled, deposit forfeited. I called and reserved the same date. Paid the deposit myself. Family group chat. Since the venue was booked, I'm using it. Come if you can. Be civil. That day, I brought my son and real friends. We had dinner, laughed, and I served a custom Dinosaur cake. As he blew out candles, Ricky posted about the most painful day of her life. And being betrayed by her brother. I wasn't angry anymore. I was free. My son would know. His father never let anyone throw away what mattered. Not his cake, not his future, not his dignity. And that felt like winning

I stood there completely calm because I knew this wasn't real. It was a performance. I knew because I'd read the script a year earlier. I'd picked up our shared iPad to look up recipe.

The message below, can't wait until you're finally free from that boring project manager, and we can do this every day. I scrolled up and found a years worth of conversation. It wasn't just an affair. It was a detailed exit strategy. They mocked my job, my friends, my life. They had their future planned out. The scheme was simple. Megan would stay with me, enjoying my financial security while I saved for a ring. She'd push for a specific diamond. The moment I proposed, he'd manufacture a fight, break up with me, and after a few weeks, go public with Julian. The ring was their prize. Seed money for their new life.

I saw the cake missing from the dessert table, then found it in the trash, completely smashed. Becky was scrolling her phone with that smug smile. What happened? I asked, trying to stay calm. She didn't look up from her phone, just shrugged. He didn't deserve it anyway. My six year old was playing with friends, completely unaware his moment had been trashed. Relax, James. It's just cake, she said when I pressed her. It wasn't just cake. It was his excitement. Talking about his Dinosaur birthday for a month. Hours of decorations I set up alone because no one else helped. I grabbed my son and left. He asked why everyone went home early. I promised a new cake. Just us. No family called that night. Next morning, mom called, not about my son, her voice shaky with panic. James, please talk to the venue before they cancel Breckie's wedding. Stunned she was calling about Breckie's wedding 24 hours after ruining my son's birthday. Are you not gonna say anything about yesterday? Brecky can be harsh, but this is her big day. No drama with the venue. Something snapped. Every holiday, Brecky came first. Every photo, she got center stage. Every time I was told to let Things go. Mom explained the venue was canceling because Brecky hadn't paid. She wanted me to cover it. I hung up. Dad showed up, arms crossed. We need to talk about Brecky's wedding. I asked if he knew what happened. He drugged. Kids are resilient. What matters is your sister's wedding doesn't become a circus. My kid's birthday was just noise to him. You're good with people. You make more than brekkie. It's nothing to you. The family rule said out loud, James fixes

They were talking about books they'd read months ago that I hadn't even heard of. I didn't mention that friendship groups take time to develop, that you need to show up consistent instantly, that you need to do the reading. Then our friend Maria threw a dinner party. Katie saw it on Instagram. That night, everyone from our friend group was there, including me. Why wasn't I invited? She asked. When I got home, I felt terrible. Maria said she texted you two weeks ago asking if you were free Saturday the 15th. You never answered. Katie checked her phone. There it was, unopened, along with dozens of other messages she'd never read. Birthday wishes. She never acknowledged. Invites she never saw check in. She never answered. But I see everyone posting in the group chat all the time, she said. Do you ever respond? Silence. The truth was crushing her. She'd been so focused on making her own plans that she never participated in anyone else's. He only reached out when she needed something. Never gave anything back. After eight years of me handling the emotional labor, she didn't even know what friendship maintenance look like. Please, can we just go back to how things were? Katie begged. I'll apologize to Everyone, I'll fix this. Please help me fix this. They're at game night right now. I said quietly, your college roommate is hosting. She asked me to co host next month. Katie went silent. Her best friend of 12 years had replaced her.

Never asked about their lives, never remembered what they told her. We ran into our friend Jen at the store. Jen mentioned her dad's surgery. Katie had no idea what she was talking about.

I stood there holding the spatula I'd been using to grill everyone's food for the last six hours. The backyard was packed with 40 relatives, all of them staring at me. Now my three siblings suddenly found their phones very interesting. You can stay behind and watch all the kids, mom added with that fake, sweet smile she'd perfected over the years. Someone responsible needs to be here. The table went quiet, except for my nephew Tommy asking for more juice. I looked around at these people I'd sacrificed everything for. My entire 20s, gone. I paid Dad's mortgage when he got fired from the plant. Covered Lisa's entire wedding when she overspent by eight grand. Took care of Mark's three kids every single weekend for three years so he could find himself. Jin's car payments, Mom's medical bills, family emergencies that always seem to land on my doorstep.

Your college friends, my gym buddies. But we always invite each other along eventually. I want completely separate social lives. You plan your things, I plan mine. No overlap. What about our mutual friends? I asked. We each maintain those friendships separately. They can invite whoever they want. I wanted to warn her, but she seemed so sure of herself. Every instinct told me this would end badly. She had no clue what she was walking into. The woman honestly believed our social life just magically happened. I agreed anyway, knowing I'd been the one keeping every friendship alive for nearly a decade. Look at this, Katie said, waving her phone in my face. It says women who maintain independent friendships report higher relationship satisfaction. 68% say it improved their marriage. I tried once more. How exactly does this work? Simple.

She said the scar made me look like a warrior goddess and asked if I'd model for her portfolio about resilience and beauty. I thought she was mocking me until she showed me the test shots on her camera, where somehow the scar caught the light and made me look powerful instead of broken. Within a month, those photos went viral on Instagram, with millions of women sharing them and calling be brave and beautiful. A modelling agency called saying they wanted to sign me specifically because my scar told a story that resonated with people tired of perfect faces. My first campaign was for a major makeup brand with a tagline beauty isn't perfect, and my scarred face was on billboards in Times Square. Every interview asked about the scar, and I told the truth about Jackson. And suddenly I was getting invited to speak at conferences about domestic violence. The modelling money let me start a foundation for women hitting abuse. I was on magazine covers and women would stop me crying, saying my story gave them courage to leave their own abusers. Jackson lost everything once my story went public and his company fired him for reputational damage. His mother called, begging me to stop ruining his life, but I wasn't doing anything except telling the truth when asked. Sophie, my assistant, forwarded me screenshots showing he was living In his car after being evicted and getting rejected from every job. Once they googled his name. His new girlfriend had left him when she found out what he did, and his friends disappeared once the news article started circulating. He'd gone from a successful marketing executive to unemployed.

Now he's back to ruin it. My husband Jackson, has been an alcoholic for years, and today he'd been drinking since noon. His boss had sent him home early for being hungover, and somehow that was my fault. When he came home, the first thing he did was hurl his pint glass at me. No greeting, no hug or kiss. Just glass shattering against my cheek and blood running down my face. I ran to the kitchen and pressed a dish towel to my face, all while he screamed that no one would ever want me now that I was damaged goods. The ER doctor said the cut would leave a permanent scar running from my left temple to the corner of my mouth and asked if I wanted to file a police report. I'd covered for Jackson for years, but knowing that my face was ruined was the last straw. I'd always wanted to be a model, even though Jackson has forbidden it. Now that dream was dead and I was done. I said yes, I wanted to file a report, while Jackson's mother called me 46 times to say I was overreacting and ruining her son's future over a little accident. Six weeks later, I was living in a women's shelter with a restraining order and a face that made strangers stare then quickly look away. The scar had healed into A curved line that looked like a crescent moon had been carved into my skin. I wore hoodies with the hood up even in summer, and avoided mirrors because Jackson's voice saying damaged goods played on repeat in my head. But slowly I started going to the support group meetings where other women had their own scars, both visible and hidden. The counselor kept telling us we were survivors, not victims, but I still flinched whenever someone looked at my face too long. Then a photographer

Mary had to be invited, too. She's changed, he insisted. She deserves a second chance. Has she apologized? I asked. You shouldn't pester her for an apology. Let bygones be bygones. I put my foot down. No apology, no invitation. Dad's ultimatum was swift. If Mary isn't invited, I won't attend either, and I won't walk you down the aisle. He tried to guilt me, saying their absence would cause gossip and reflect poorly on me. Instead of caving, I disinvited him completely. I asked my paternal grandfather to walk me down the aisle instead. Grandpa immediately agreed and expressed his disappointment in Dad's behavior. He'd always known about the favor and blame dad placed on me. My wedding day was beautiful. Grandpa walked me down the aisle with pride, and we celebrated with people who truly cared about my happiness. But the real shock came during the reception. Grandpa stood up and made an announcement. He was gifting me his vacation house as a wedding present. Out of my son and granddaughters, he said, you're the one who truly appreciates family and will cherish this place. Dad had always assumed he'd inherit everything as Grandpa's only child, including that vacation house. When dad found out about the wedding and the gift, he lost it completely. He called me screaming, saying he couldn't believe I'd gone through with it without him. What really sent him over the edge was losing the inheritance. He'd count It on now. Dad and Mary are furious, demanding I return the house to him and claiming it's his legal right as the heir. Mary's been calling me an opportunist who manipulated Grandpa's generosity. Dad's favoritism and ultimatums didn't just cost him his daughter's wedding. They cost him the inheritance he was counting on.

So I refused to back down and asked my grandpa to walk me down the aisle instead. My father has always blamed me for my mother's death during childbirth, while my older sister Mary became his golden child who could do no wrong. I spent my childhood doing every household chore, being constantly ignored, and carrying guilt for something completely beyond my control. The breaking point came during a Thanksgiving visit when my sister met my then boyfriend of two years. Mary flirted shamelessly with him all night, constantly touching his arm, leaning into his personal space, calling him gorgeous while putting me down by saying she never thought her ugly duckling sister would land someone like him. When I pulled her aside and asked her to stop, she laughed in my face and called me pathetically jealous. At night, I went to bed early, emotionally and physically exhausted by the blatant disrespect in my own family's home. My boyfriend said he'd come up soon, but never did. The next morning, I found him in Mary's bed, both half naked with two empty wine bottles and glasses scattered on the floor. Mary's reaction when I caught them? Zero apology. She had the audacity to tell me to get out of her room so she can get dressed, like I was invading her privacy. Then she spent weeks bragging to Our cousins. About stealing my man in one night. And claimed he told her she was way better in bed than me. Dad's response when I told him what happened. They're both adults. You should have been more careful about the kind of man you brought around, Mary. He obviously has loose character. That's on you for not seeing it. He actually blamed me for bringing a cheater around his precious daughter. As if.

At one PM, the hospice nurse came back on. She's asking if her mommy is mad at her. My vision blurred with tears. I was still eight minutes away. Tell her mommy loves her so much. Tell her. Wait. She wants to say something. I heard rustling, then Rose's voice, barely a whisper. Tell Mommy it's okay. One o three PM, I burst through the hospice doors, taking the stairs three at a time. Room 5:32. Rose looks so small in that bed, her skin almost translucent. When I crashed through the door, completely out of breath, my keys cutting into my palm from gripping them so hard, her eyes fluttered open. Rose, I'm here. I love you so much. I'm so sorry. I squeezed my hand with what little strength she had left. Her lips moved. I leaned in close. I love. Her mouth formed the shape of you. But no sound came. Her hand went slack in mine. Beep! The nurse quietly entered to turn the machines off. Mom arrived at 1:35 p m, reeking of champagne and carrying two target bags. I stopped to get her a stuffed animal, she announced, pulling out a unicorn. Where is she? Saw roses still form the empty eyes, the silence where machines used to beep. Why didn't you try harder to get me here? She turned on me, her voice rising. You knew I was out. You should have sent a car service. Or. She asked for You. 17 times the nurse said, quiet. Your son held the phone to her ear so she could hear your voice. But Mom's face hardened. She was dying anyway. What difference would it have made? I held up Rose's last drawing, still on her bedside table. Stick figures labeled me and Mommy holding hands under a rainbow. You're trying to make me feel guilty. Mom spat. She didn't even know I wasn't here. I said nothing. I was ready to give my mom the same treatment she gave her daughter. Full story on channel link below.

My roommate, Rose's teacher from before she got sick. Weekend trip. All too busy to visit a nine year old on the brink of death. At 12:15 p m, the hospice nurse held the phone to Rose's ear again.

She expected that. I forgot to send crisis calls. I didn't answer. Then she showed up at my apartment on a Tuesday. Mascara smudged, hair messy. You're ignoring me, she said, voice trembling. No, I've been answering your texts. You know what I mean. This isn't how friends act. You're right. Friends don't owe each other Midnight Crisis calls. Friends don't scream at each other for having boundaries. Friends don't show up unannounced demanding emotional labor. Since when are you such an emotionless robot? Since you told me we were better as friends. This is what that looks like? For the first time, I saw it click. The realization that I wasn't playing some revenge game or tactic to win her back. This was just what was left. Don't get to hate me for treating you exactly how you asked to be treated, I said quietly. Tears spilled over. Not the pretty, performative ones that used to got me, but messy, real ones. You were supposed to. Her voice cracked. What, wait around as your backup plan? Stay on the hook in case things didn't work out with Mark? She didn't answer. The silence stretched between us, thick with everything she'd never admit out loud. Her last text came a week later. Maybe we could try again. I stared at it for a long moment before typing. Nah. We're better as friends, remember? Then I blocked her number. Six months later, I saw her at A coffee shop. Sitting alone by the window, staring into a half empty cup. No Mark, no friends. Just her. And that same vanilla perfume hanging in the air like a ghost. She spotted me. Her eyes widened with hope, panic, then shame. She opened her mouth like she might call out to me. I gave her a polite nod, the kind you'd give an acquaintance, took my coffee and walked out without looking back.

So I treated her like any other casual acquaintance. Now she's begging me to care like I used to, but I'm not interested anymore. We've been together for three years when she delivered the line over dinner in our apartment. We're better as friends, she said, swirling wine in her glass, like this was just another casual conversation. I need space to breathe, to figure myself out. The soft lighting made her look almost regretful, but I could see the nervous energy buzzing beneath her skin. Her foot tapped impatiently against the hardwood floor. She wanted a reaction. Tears, begging, maybe even anger. Anything to prove this mattered. Okay, I said, if that's what you want. Her eyebrows twitched. That wasn't the script she rehearsed. You're just too much sometimes, she continued, words tumbling out. I'll always love you, just not like that. She reached across to squeeze my hand with that old comforting gesture that used to mean something. I get it, I said, sliding my hand away. No hard feelings. Her face did something complicated. Confusion, then irritation, maybe even disappointment. She wanted a scene, wanted to be the one walking away from tears and pleading. Instead she was getting indifference. You're taking this really well, she said, accusation creeping into her tone. What's there to take badly? You said we're better as friends. I believe you. I just thought you'd fight for us. You're breaking up with Me and mad. I'm not arguing about it. She wanted to be the strong one, the one who walked away with dignity. Instead, I was perfectly composed while she fumbled for control. I just thought what we had meant more to you, she muttered. It did. But I'm not going to beg someone to stay who wants to leave. She left that night expecting me to chase her.

So I'm standing in the middle of a thrift store holding a note I just found in a vintage jacket's pocket, and my hands won't stop shaking. The note says Priya, wear this jacket to Meridian Park on June 10th at three PM. Stand in the red circle. Your life will change forever. My name is Priya. Spelled exactly like that. Not the Americanized Priya everyone always assumes. But I've never seen this jacket before, and I literally walked into this store 90 seconds ago. What's more, today is literally June 10th. It's currently two thirty PM, and the jacket fits perfectly. The rational part of my brain screamed this was obviously some elaborate prank, or maybe I was being recruited for one of those hidden camera shows, but the 23 year old part of me, who'd spent the last year in the most boring accounting job imaginable, couldn't resist the pull of whatever this was. I bought the jacket for $7, drove straight to Meridian Park, and arrived at 2:58 p. M. Wearing it like armor. The park was weirdly crowded for a Tuesday afternoon, with at least 40 people scattered around, seemingly doing normal park things reading, jogging, playing Frisbee. But something felt choreographed about it all. When I walked past a group of women on a blanket, they all simultaneously looked away. A jogger ran the same loop three times, checking his watch each time he passed. Me, two guys with obviously expensive camera equipment tried to look casual by pretending to film squirrels, but one of them was holding the camera backwards. I actually laughed out loud at that one, and he turned bright red. My heart was pounding like I was about to jump out of a plane. This was it. This was the adventure I've been waiting for my whole mundane life. I spotted the red circle spray painted near the fountain. Took a deep brass it tasted like possibility, and walked toward it, feeling like the main character. The second my feet touched the red circle, the world exploded into orchestrated chaos. Drums start beating from hidden speakers. Violins joined in with some classical piece I recognized but couldn't name. And suddenly, everyone in the park stood up and started throwing rose petals into the air. Amazing. It was like being inside a snow globe made of flowers. People formed a pathway behind me, all of them grinning and filming with their phones. My heart was doing gymnastics in my chest. This was happening. This was really happening. Something magical, something extraordinary was finally happening to me. A voice behind me, nervous but determined, said, Priya, will you marry me? I spun around, already laughing and crying at the same time, ready to see who had orchestrated this incredible moment. Ready to say yes to the adventure. Ready for my life to finally begin. A man I'd never seen before in my life. Was kneeling in front of me, holding out a ring box. But when he saw my face, his face went from hopeful to confused to horrified in about two seconds. The ring tumbled from his shaking hands. Who the hell are you? He whispered, still on one knee, while rose petals continued to fall around us like confused butterflies. You're not Priya. The music cut off abruptly. Someone in the crowd said, that's not her. Quinnie. The guy quinnie apparently stood up slowly with his face pale. You're wearing her jacket, he said. Um. I found this jacket.

I said, cancel the entire wedding? She gasped. But, sir, you're not the bride. No, but I own the venue, the catering company, and the hotel chain. They booked for guests. See, my brother James was marrying this entitled socialite, Melissa. Her mom, Eleanor, treated me like hired help. From day one. They made insane demands. Wanted me to remove a historic chandelier because it clashed with the aesthetic. My staff create 15 different sample menus before choosing, then demanded we redo them because the fonts were too common. The worst part, they'd schedule meetings with my venue coordinator at 6 a m, then cancel 30 minutes before my poor manager, Anthony, would drive across town for nothing. You're a saint for putting up with this. Told me after Eleanor demanded we repaint the entire ballroom because the current shade of ivory was too pedestrian. Eleanor also insisted we fire our head chef because he looked unprofessional, meaning he was Hispanic. I refused, but she kept pushing. I tolerated it because I love James. Growing up, it was just us two. After our parents divorced messily, I practically raised him while mom worked three jobs. When I built my hotel empire from nothing, starting as a waitress and working my way up, James was my biggest cheerleader. He'd brag to friends about his sister who made it big. But Melissa changed him completely. Suddenly, My new money was embarrassing. Eleanor would make comments about how some people think wealth means class. During one particularly nasty encounter, she looked around my flagship hotel's lobby and sniffed, it's very commercial, isn't it? Not quite the atmosphere for discerning clientele. When invitation time came, nothing arrived in my mailbox. I waited weeks, checking daily. I called other family members. Everyone got theirs. Gorgeous gold foil with handwritten notes from Melissa thanking them for being true family. At our family dinner, Eleanor made it crystal clear. There's a difference between serving the elite and being one of them. Don't you think, Natalie? She said my name like it tasted bitter. James just stared at his late. My own brother. Wouldn't defend me. That's when Melissa chimed in. The wedding is very intimate. We're keeping it to people who truly understand our vision. They saw me as the help, not family. Good enough to provide the venue, staff and accommodations, but not good enough, to wit, miss their special day. The wedding planners call was the last straw. They wanted me to pay, but not attend my own brother's wedding. We've decided the guest list needs to be more refined, she explained, and awkwardly. But, of course, all the vendor contracts remain in place, exactly as agreed. So I pulled the plug on everything. Ma'am, as of now, the venue is unavailable, catering is canceled, and all hotel rooms are released. Your clients will need to find new vendors. Immediately. You can't do that. The contracts are iron clad. Check the fine print carefully. All agreements are void if the vendor is excluded from the event without cause. My lawyers made sure of that clause. Three hours later, James called, sobbing hysterically. Melissa was having a complete meltdown. No!

But I felt more embarrassed for him. In the end, all the signs were there. My husband Rodney was coming home late from work. He started going to the gym on weekends, wearing expensive Cologne, buying all these expensive watches and shirts. Everything he constantly said was stupid and unnecessary. Now that we were married, I never really connected the pieces. Until one day it happened. My friend Millie and I were chatting on the phone while she was swiping through Tinder, when she gasped. Sam, she said suddenly, really loud, why is Rodney on Tinder? She instantly took screenshots and texted them over. I covered my mouth, too shocked to speak. They were my husband's old pictures, with where them fun girls at? In the description. Maybe this is old, I said. It says he's active two minutes ago, Millie said quietly, but I still couldn't believe it. Later, when Rodney stepped into the shower, I quickly checked his phone on the nightstand. The notifications told the whole story. New message from Laurel. New message from Melissa. Matched with Sarah. Dating apps I'd never heard of. Lit up his screen like a slot machine. When he came out of the shower, I was sitting on the bed with his phone. It's not what it looks like, he said immediately. It looks like you're on five dating apps while you're married. He snatched his phone from my hand. You went through my phone without my Permission? That's Psycho, Sam, he said, as if I was the villain here. This is. This is cheating, Rodney. This is your fault. You're too vanilla. You make cookies and sing songs about colors all day. I'm a guy. I need excitement. Excitement! I repeated in disbelief. Rodney, get out! You're seriously ending our marriage over this? He scoffed. I said, get out! He packed a bag, still ranting. Good luck finding someone who wants a boring wife with a boring job and boring life. He slammed the door on his way out. I changed the locks the next morning, and I thought that was it. That I'd never have to deal with that horrible man ever again. But I was so wrong. I was stuck in my house all week, crying and stuffing my face with ice cream, when my friend Millie showed up to my house with reinforcements. Three of our friends burst through my door with wine and my red dress. It's singles night, and you're coming with us, they said, already dragging me into the shower to get ready. Guys, I have appreciate you stopping by, but I'm really not ready. I sighed. Sam, you don't have to meet anyone. You just gotta get out, get some fresh air, be with friends. Remember just how amazing you were without him. I look at them, seeing how much they cared for me. I couldn't say no. The place was packed and I felt so out of place. Got dragged here by friends, too? A man asked, approaching me with a friendly smile. They were honestly doing me a favor, I said, smiling back. My friends happily watched us talk from a distance, almost tearing up when they saw me laughing again. But the man, Justin, a pediatrician who was really just that funny. His story about his nephew's show until disaster was heartwarming and wild, and the more I spoke with him, the more all the pain and heartbreak seemed to go away. But just as we started really hitting it off, Rodney entered the bar and started going around the room, approaching woman after woman. I felt my face pale until I saw something strange. All the women kept turning him away. One actually held up her hand in his face and walked off. Another looked at him, made a disgusted face, and turned back to her friends, and I almost felt embarrassed for him. Then he spotted me with Justin and stormed over. Hey, buddy, that's my wife! He grabbed my arm painfully. Justin pushed him away and looked at Rodney's left hand. I don't see a ring. Rodney's face went red. He turned to me. We're still married, you know. Wow! That's exactly what I told you when I found out you were on

Two years with Emma, and I thought we were rock solid. We moved in together after 18 months, split everything fifty fifty, supported each other's dreams, and genuinely talked about marriage. But her three single friends, complete relationship vultures who couldn't stand seeing anyone happy. Madison, Ashley, and Chloe. They found red flags in good morning texts and thought guys who don't immediately respond are emotionally unavailable. These three met twice a week for their wine nights at Madison's apartment. At first, Emma would come home with innocent questions. Madison thinks it's weird you don't get jealous when guys talk to me at the coffee shop. Or Ashley says most guys would have proposed by now if they were serious. I'd address these calmly, reassure her about our timeline and trust, and we'd move on. I thought it was just friend noise, but it escalated quickly. Emma started testing me constantly. She'd cancel our date nights last minute to see if I'd fight her on it or just accept it. She'd flirt with guys right in front of me at parties to see if I'd get possessive and stake my claim. She'd pick random fights about dishes or whose turn it was to buy groceries, then storm off to see if I chase after her and beg for forgiveness. I tried patience. I tried communication. I even suggested couples counseling to work through whatever was making her feel insecure. But Madison convinced her that suggesting therapy meant I thought she was crazy and that our relationship was already doomed. The breaking point came on our two year anniversary. I've been planning for weeks dinner at the same Italian place where we had our first date. I'd even reserve the same corner booth. After dinner, I had a surprise weekend getaway planned, complete with the Vineyard tour she'd been mentioning. Emma seemed off all day, checking her phone constantly. Jump when it buzzed. I figured she was planning her own anniversary surprise. Maybe finally ready to have that serious conversation about our future. We're at dinner. The ambiance was perfect. And suddenly, right as the waiter is setting down our bruschetta, Emma gets this dead serious look. Jake, I think we should break up. I literally choked on my water. I'm sorry. What? She launches into this clearly rehearsed speech about needing passion, intensity, someone who would fight for her. The words sounded completely foreign coming out of her mouth. Stilted, practiced, like she was reading someone else's script. I need to know you do anything for me, she said, staring at the bread basket instead of my face. I need someone who won't.

Monday morning, my boss, Veronica, called me into her office and closed the door behind me, which immediately made my stomach tighten. You need to stop helping other departments, he said. I was confused because I've been doing the quarterly investor reports for three years. Marketing, finance, legal can all handle their own sections now, she said, and her voice had this bitter edge that I'd never heard before. Yesterday, the CEO praised you at the board meeting. Not our department, you personally. She was actually trembling with jealousy, and it made me uncomfortable. That ends now, I reminded her. The CEO specifically asked me to create the quarterly report that investors needed next week. I'll handle that myself, she said confidently. But I knew something she didn't know. She didn't have access to any of the other department systems, and I've been given special permissions over the years that she'd never needed. I'm putting this in writing. She type an email right there and sent it to everyone, including HR. New policy. You will only do work I directly assign. No exceptions. She made me reply all confirming I understood. Perfect. Anyone asks for help, send them to me. I walked out, knowing this would end badly. The quarterly report was due next week. Over the next few days, each department called me about their sections of the quarter early report. I felt terrible telling them Veronica was Handling it now. But I had to follow her written policy. By Thursday, Veronica discovered her problem. She couldn't access any of the systems. I heard her on the phone with it, getting louder and louder. What do you mean, I don't have permissions? She slammed the phone down and came to my desk, looking down. I need your login credentials, she said quietly. That violates company security policy. I said, people get fired for sharing logins. She knew I was right, and her face got red. Then walk me through getting access. She tried your email. Said, I only do assigned work. I reminded her, teaching you isn't on my assignment list. She stood there for a full minute, just staring at me before storming off. By early next week, department heads were getting nervous about the approaching deadline. Veronica kept stalling them with excuses. Then Tuesday morning, the CEO called her directly, and I heard everything through our thin wall. I need the quarterly report tomorrow for the investor call. He said. She's straight up lied to him. Final touches. You'll have it tonight. But she had absolutely nothing, and we both knew it. That afternoon, she tried being clever. I'm assigning you to create the quarterly report, she said casually. I need that in writing, sent to everyone, like your first email, I said. She went pale because she couldn't do it without admitting she'd lied to the CEO. Just this once, she actually begged. Your policy, Says no exceptions, I reminded her. Wednesday morning, hours before the investor call, the CEO walked in with the CFO and HR director. Where's the report? He demanded. Veronica opened her laptop and showed them empty folders. I don't have system access, she finally admitted. The CFO looked shocked. You told us yesterday it was done. You lied. HR was taking notes furiously. Marketing's director appeared, looking angry. She told me she submitted our section. Another lie. Finance arrived next. Same here. The CEO's face turned dark. You lied to me about investor materials

Three months later she was begging me to stop dating. So I'm 26 and single and apparently that's a crime against humanity according to my family. Every Sunday dinner at my parents house turns into this interrogation about my love life. My mom keeps getting me screenshots of her co worker's sons with captions like he's an accountant, stable income. Meanwhile, my sister, who got married at 22, keeps going, your eggs are literally dying. Do you understand that? Every month you wait, is another dead egg. Like, okay, I didn't realize I was a walking cemetery. My dad's the worst, though. He'll literally pause the football game to announce, you know, this lady from church has a nephew who just moved back from dental school. And then my aunt chimes in with her theory that I'm too picky because I rejected her neighbor's son, who, by the way, lives in his mom's basement and collects anime body pillows. The breaking point was Thanksgiving when my grandma grabbed my face with both hands and goes, I want to see great grandchildren before I die. And I have diabetes, so TikTok. My cousin literally set up a Powerpoint presentation called why some people need to lower their standards with actual graphs showing the declining marriage rates for women over 25. My mom starts crying into the mashed potatoes saying she failed as a mother because she didn't teach me how to catch a man. That's when I decided if they want to see me dating so badly, I can date. I post on Craigslist offering 50 bucks plus free dinner for guys to pretend to be my boyfriend at family events. Then I hit up my college theater department's Facebook page. The responses are insane. First dinner I bring a guy who shows up in a full Renaissance Fair gear because I told him to be himself. He performs Shakespeare monologues between courses and calls my mom my lady. She keeps whispering, is he okay? Next week it's a guy from my economics class. He won't stop talking about cryptocurrency. He literally pulls out charts during dessert to explain why my family should invest their retirement in Dogecoin. My dad's eye is twitching the entire time. Week 4 is an older guy who shows up drunk and tries to sell everyone investment opportunities in his friend's food truck. He calls my dad bro 17 times before appetizers. My mom's face is frozen in horror. My favorite was week 6. Guy shows up in a full furry costume because I said dress casually. He keeps his wolf head on during dinner and asks if we have any raw meat. The word spreads through the family group chat that I'm apparently running through men like a common street walker. My mom starts leaving pamphlets for sex addiction on my bed, but I keep going. Week seven I bring this gorgeous guy from the gym who's actually Perfect. He brings wine, compliments my mom's cooking, talks sports with my dad. The whole family is literally glowing. My sister pulls me aside. Finally lock this one down. Then the next week, when I arrive with my date, my mom goes, we're so happy you're back. My date just goes, I've never been here before, ma'am. You must be talking about my twin brother. The silence is deafening. My aunt literally drops her fork and whispers, she's collecting them. After that, my family starts having pre dinner meetings about the situation. This continues for three months. I bring 23 different men total to all family gatherings, each one a calculated disaster. My mom cries and says I'm broken. My sister creates an intervention, complete with pros and cons lists. Where

The principal told him to check which year he was living in. My ex husband Sean had been planning this moment for weeks. Ever since I started dating again last month, he'd been texting his mother about how he was finally going to put me in my place. He even hired a lawyer friend to draft fake emergency custody papers that he kept showing off at his gym. The ink wasn't even dry on our three year old custody agreement before Sean started plotting. He drive by the school during my pickup days, taking photos through the fence and telling his girlfriend he was building evidence. Abigail thinks she owns those kids. He post on Facebook while sitting in his truck. Time someone taught her what real consequences feel like. So there I was, standing in the crowded pickup line at my daughter's school, the whole place buzzing with parents chatting about homework and soccer practice. Sean showed up with two police officers strutting across the parking lot in his pressed khakis and polo shirt, practically glowing with self righteousness. His brother Terry walked beside him, recording everything on his phone. Both of them moving through the crowd like they owned the place. Abby, I hope you're ready for jail, Sean announced loud enough for every parent to hear. You've kidnapped my children for the last time. This ends today. I kept my hands steady at my sides. Watching the other parents step back, let him make his scene. Officers approached slowly. Officer Walker was young, maybe 25, looking uncomfortable. His partner, Officer Lee, seemed tired already. Sean rushed forward before they could even speak. Officers, this woman has stolen my children. It's my custody week and she refuses to return them. I have proof right here. Terry nodded enthusiastically. We've been trying to reach her all week. She's completely unhinged. Officer Walker pulled out his notepad, glancing between us. Ma'am, can you explain what's happening here? Sean's face was already red. Don't let her manipulate you. She's a pathological liar who's been alienating my kids for years. Check her record. She's probably done this before. Mrs. Jones, the principal walked out right then. She was this tiny sixteen year old woman with silver hair and sensible shoes. She looked like she'd rather be inside finishing paperwork. Sean immediately pivoted toward her. Finally, someone with authority. Mrs. Jones, I need my children released immediately. Their mother is violating our custody agreement and I want her arrested for kidnapping. Mrs. Jones adjusted her glasses, looking genuinely puzzled. I'm sorry, Mr. Lewis, but what custody violation are you referring to exactly? Sean's neck veins started showing. My City Week. She took them during my scheduled time. I want them now, and I want her charged. Don't play games with me, Missus. Jones walked back to the entrance and returned with her laptop and a thick Manila folder. She set them On the picnic table near the flagpole, Officer Lee moved closer to look. Sean and Terry exchanged confident glances while I felt my heart hammering. Mister Lewis, she said, slowly opening the folder, according to our records, you haven't had a scheduled custody week in three years. The color in Sean's face went from red to white in seconds. What are you talking about? Mrs. Of Jones turned the laptop screen toward the officers. We maintain detailed custody calendars for all our divorced parents, digital and paper copies. She pulled out a spreadsheet with highlighted sections. You voluntarily gave up your alternating weeks in March

He demanded $500 rent from me. I had just turned 18, but was still in high school. Starting next month, you pay rent, he said, walking into my room without knocking. I looked up for my math homework. But I'm in high school. Doesn't matter. You're 18. Adults pay rent. My mom stood behind him, looking at the floor. Carl thinks it will teach you to be responsible, she said quietly. I only made $600 a month at my grocery store job. He wanted almost all of it. That. That's life, Carl said with a big smile. My son joined the army at 18. You're spoiled. He'd been saying this since he married my mom two years ago. His son was perfect. I was always wrong. If you don't like it, move out, he said. I looked at his smug face and got an idea. Okay, Carl, I'll pay rent. $500 on the first of every month. His smile got bigger. Good. Maybe now you'll grow up. He walked out, thinking he'd won. He had no idea what kind of tenant I was about to become. I gave Carl a check for $500 at breakfast. I need a receipt, I said. Why? Landlords have to give receipts. It's the law. He was annoyed, but wrote one on a napkin. That night I invited three friends over at. At night. We played video games loudly in the living room. Carl ran out in His underwear. What are you doing? It's midnight. I can have guests whenever I want. I pay rent. Mom came out looking tired. Please be quiet. We have work tomorrow. I have tenant rights, I said, turning the volume up. Carl's face turned purple. This is my house, and I'm your tenant. His mouth opened and closed like a fish. Mom them back to their bedroom. The next morning, I went to the hardware store while Carl was at work. I bought a doorknob with a lock for $30 and put it on my bedroom door. When Carl got home, he tried to walk into my room. The door was locked. What is this? Privacy. Tenants get privacy. Take it off. No. If you wanna come in, give me a day's notice. Mom watched from the hallway. Carl grabbed the doorknob hard. You're damaging my room, I said. I'll report you. He let go immediately. Later, the kitchen sink started dripping. I texted Carl, the sink is broken. Fix it in three days or I take the repair cost out of my rent. He showed the text to mom at dinner. Can he do that? Mom looked it up on her phone and nodded. Carl fixed the sink that night, angry the whole time. Then Carl's parents came for dinner. Mom cooked a big meal. Everyone sat down but me. I walked in with a sandwich from the gas station. Why aren't you eating Mom's food? Carl's dad asked. Food Isn't included in my rent. I'm just a tenant. Carl's dad put down his fork. You charge him rent? He's in high school. He needs to learn responsibility, Carl said quietly. His dad stared at him. You charge your wife's son rent while he's in school? Nobody said anything. Carl's dad shook his head. That's terrible. Carl looked at his plate. I ate my sandwich. Carl was losing his mind. He tried to get into my room every day. They fought every night.

My husband started slamming his laptop shut whenever I walked into the room, even when he was supposedly just checking basketball scores. 18 years of marriage, and suddenly this man was acting like a teenager caught watching porn. Every single time I entered the living room, Bam! Laptop closed, chin slam, bedroom shut so fast the screen probably cracked. At first I figured, okay, maybe he's planning some romantic anniversary surprise. But then weeks passed and the behavior got worse and worse. He actually installed one of those privacy screens that makes everything invisible unless you're sitting directly in front of it. Real subtle, honey. Then he installed a new secret browser I'd never seen before. Always full of weather websites whenever I did catch a glimpse. But the late night typing sessions were what really got me spiraling. Two, three, four, 4 in the morning, I could see that blue glow from under our door and hear the crazy fast keyboard typing that stopped the second I even moved in bed. One night, I pretended to be asleep and crept to the door to listen. He was actually whispering while he typed, and I distinctly heard him say, please don't do it under his breath. My thoughts immediately went to bad places, what else makes a grown man whisper desperately at his computer at 3:00am? Online gambling destroying our savings. Affair with someone threatening to expose him. At his firm. Something huge that could end our marriage. The next morning was when it started getting really bad. He started looking absolutely wrecked every morning with 1,000 yards air before he left for work. Our young daughter asked why daddy looks sick all the time. And his law partners called me asking if everything was okay because he'd been falling asleep at the desk. Then I found the sticky note that confused me even more. It was jammed in his jacket pocket. Said throw away kid 4 4 7 responded with yesterday's date. My heart sank because throw away accounts meant one thing. He was doing something he needed to hide. The username had kid in it, which made it so much worse. Was my husband talking to children online using fake names. If this got out, he'd lose his license, we lose everything, and he'd be on a registry. The thought made me wretch, but I needed proof before calling divorce lawyers. I didn't care anymore and went straight for his laptop and found an email account bookmarked and hidden in a folder labeled taxes. Apparently he forgot I do our actual taxes. The drafts contained half written messages starting with things like I know everything feels hopeless, but please wait until tomorrow. The recipients all had usernames with numbers and words like lost or ending in them. But the spreadsheet was what really messed me up. 47 rows of usernames tracking last posted and status. Some Said worried, while others were marked okay, all good and green. This man was maintaining a whole database of minors. And the paranoid secrecy suddenly made horrible sense. That evening when he came home, I wanted answers. After our kids went to bed, I completely lost it. Demanding to know what sick corner of the internet he was living in every night. The man stopped for 10 seconds, then completely broke down, sobbing uglier than I'd ever seen him cry. And finally opened that laptop to explain everything to me. Screen after screen of messages to teenagers on unalive forums. Kids posting goodbye notes at 2:00am. And my husband's paragraphs trying to convince them to stay alive. He'd been doing this every single night for months. Finding kids on the edge and messaging them resources, hotline numbers. He was

I was drawing basketball plays in detention when Mister Hugh picked up my notebook and said, you just mapped out vector physics and probability theory. I thought he was mocking me like everyone else, but his eyes were serious. I'm the dumb kid, I told him. Ask anyone. I've been the class idiot since kindergarten. Couldn't read properly, spelled my own name wrong on tests, got a zero in math once, and the teacher held it up asking, how is this even possible? Someone yelled, give him negative points! And everyone laughed, including her. During group projects, kids would literally cry when paired with me. One girl told her partner, just do his part. He won't understand anyway. She said it right in front of me like I wasn't even human. Parent teacher conferences for torture. Have you considered testing for learning disabilities? Maybe a special school? I've been teaching 20 years and I've never seen a case this severe. My mom would cry in the car afterward. You're not stupid, baby, you're not. But even she looked out for sometimes. By 8th grade, I'd stop trying. Why bother when teachers pre wrote F on my papers before I turned them in? Then Mister Hugh arrived as our substitute. While everyone warned him about the problem kids, he walked past my desk and stopped at my notebook full of diagrams and arrows. What is this? He Flipped through pages of plays I'd drawn from last night. Lakers game. Nothing. This isn't nothing. Explain this to me. He pointed at a complex play I'd mapped. That's where LeBron fakes the pick and roll. But actually, I explained the whole play. How the defense would shift where the opening would appear. You just described angular momentum and predictive analysis. No, I described basketball. He smiled. Same thing. Saturday, 9:00am. Gym. I coach youth basketball, and I need an assistant. I showed up thinking he'd realize his mistake. Instead, he had me analyze his team's plays. See how No. 7 keeps telegraphing his cuts? Said his shoulders dip left before he goes right every time. Mister Hugh started writing on his clipboard. You're describing biomechanical patterns and statistical probability. I'm describing basketball. Let me show you something. He drew a parabola on the whiteboard. What's this? A free throw arc. It's also a quadratic equation. He wrote numbers next to it. The optimal release angle is 45 degrees, but Steph Curry shoots at 50 degrees. Know why? His release point is higher, so he needs a steeper angle to maintain the same entry angle at the rim. You just solved for X in an equation PhD students struggle with. My brain broke, but I can't do math. You've been doing math your whole life. We just called it the wrong thing. He started teaching me everything through basketball. History became the integration of the NBA. Biology was about fast Twitch versus slow twitch. Muscle fibers in different positions. English essays analyzed game footage. If Curry shoots 43% from three, but 38% and guarded tight and the defender is two feet away, what's the expected value of the shot? I calculated it instantly. 1 14 points. So he should shoot. You just did statistics that college students fail. Six weeks later, I raised my hand in regular class and correctly answered a physics question. The room went silent. Someone whispered, did he just. The teacher looked stunned. That's correct. Exactly correct. Parent teacher conferences came. My parents walked in, already apologizing. We know he's struggling. Your son is gifted. Mister Hugh interrupted. My mom laughed nervously. I think you have the wrong student file. No, watch this. He turned to me, explained defensive rotation efficiency using mathematical principles. I lit up explaining help defense angles, rotation timing. How you calculate the probability of successful switches based on player speed and court positioning. My dad's mouth. Fellow, what is happening? Your son has been doing advanced mathematics for years. His brain just processes information through basketball. Once we translated it, everything clicked. My mom started crying. Not the sad tears from before, but something else. He tested into Advanced Placement. Mister Hugh continued all subjects. But mom grabbed my hand. All those teachers who said they were wrong. He was never dumb.

But he had no idea what was waiting for him inside my house. Should I have warned him? Nine years ago, Logan divorced me over a massive misunderstanding. He came home early and saw my gay best friend Julian, helping me try on bridesmaid dresses for his own wedding. Logan saw a man in our bedroom, jumped to conclusions and filed for divorce before I could even explain. I begged him to listen, but he blocked me everywhere. Julian tried, reaching out to nothing. Logan was convinced I cheated and refused to hear the truth. He wouldn't even let me speak at the divorce proceedings. His lawyer did all the talking while Logan sat there stone faced, treating me like I was some stranger who'd betrayed him. The worst part? We'd been together for six years. Six years of building a life together. And he threw it all away without giving me five minutes to explain. I lost everything. Our house, our dog, most of our mutual friends who believed his version of events. So I moved on, took a job at a law firm as a paralegal, worked my way up and eventually went to law school at night. It was brutal, studying until 2:00am while working full time. But I was determined to rebuild myself into someone stronger. That's where I met Asher. He was in my constitutional law study group. Unlike Logan Asher actually listened when I spoke, believed in me, supported my dreams, and never once made me feel like I had to prove my worth. We got married three years ago and now have twin boys who are 4 years old. Fast forward to last Saturday. I'm in my kitchen making pancakes for the boys when the doorbell rings through the peephole. There's Logan with a massive bouquet of roses, looking like he just stepped off a magazine cover. Still handsome, still that cocky smile that used to make my heart race. I opened the door and he launched into this speech. Reyna, I finally Learned the truth about Julian. I ran into him at a conference last month and he told me everything. I realize now that I made a terrible mistake. I'm ready to forgive you and start over. We can have the life we always planned. I stared at him in disbelief. Forgive me? After nine years of silence, after destroying our marriage over his own paranoia, he thinks he can just waltz back in and graciously forgive me for something I never did. That's when Asher appeared behind me, wiping flour off his hands from helping with breakfast. Everything okay, babe? He asked, putting a protective arm around my waist. Our twin boys came running up behind him. Mommy, who's that man? Little Jamie asked, chocolate chips still smeared on his face. Logan's expression went from confident to confused to absolutely horrified. His eyes darted. Between Asher, the boys, and the family photos visible on our hallway wall. You. You're married? You have kids? I smiled sweetly, feeling a satisfaction I didn't expect. Yes, Logan. To someone who actually believes in communication and trust. Someone who lets me explain before jumping to conclusions. Logan stammered. But I thought. I mean, I figured you'd wait, that you'd want to work things out once I Learned the truth. Wait? I laughed, and it came out sharper than I intended. You mean wait nine years for you to accidentally discover what five minutes of conversation could have told you? Wait for you to decide I'm worthy of basic human decency? Asher squeezed my hand, sensing my rising anger. The boys had lost interest and run back to the kitchen, but I could hear them chattering about the strange man with flowers. Reyna, please, Logan said, his confidence crumbling. I know I messed up. But we had something special. We can have that again. We did have something special.

But when my new partner turned out to be a perfect match, she demanded to close it. I should have seen this coming. After 10 years of marriage, our bedroom life had basically flatlined. We'd gone from passionate newlyweds to roommates who maybe got intimate once a month, if I was extremely lucky. Every attempt I made to discuss it got shut down or brushed off. When Sarah sat me down that Tuesday evening, I thought maybe she'd finally want to work on us. Instead, she dropped a bomb. I want to open our marriage. I just stared at her across our kitchen table. What? I'm bored. Honey, it's like eating the same meal every single day for a decade. I love you, but I need something fresh, something exciting again. My ego shattered into pieces. But honestly, part of me was actually relieved. I've been so starved for affection and real intimacy that I'd secretly fantasized about this exact scenario, though I'd never admit it out loud to anyone. We spent the next hour setting detailed ground rules. No one we know personally. Always use Protection without exception. Don't ask, don't tell about specific details. Keep emotions completely out of it. Sarah seemed absolutely giddy with excitement as we talked, like she was planning some amazing vacation. Within 48 hours, she was dressed to the nines in an outfit I hadn't seen in months, practically bouncing as she headed Out for her first tinder date, she came home at 2 a m. With messy hair and that satisfied, glowing expression I hadn't seen on her face in literal years. I pretended to be fast asleep. That's when I decided I absolutely wasn't going to be the pathetic husband sitting at home alone while she had all the fun. I reached out to Emma, someone I've been casually chatting with in my Lego discord server for months. It was funny, genuinely kind, and actually shared my supposedly nerdy hobbies that Sarah always mocked. Our first meet up was supposed to be completely innocent, building a new Lego architecture set together at her cozy apartment. But as we worked on the detailed statue of Liberty set, talking and laughing about everything, something just clicked perfectly. She actually listened intently when I explained the fascinating engineering behind the build. She asked genuine, thoughtful questions about my interests instead of rolling her eyes like Sarah always did. You know, Emma said softly, carefully placing a tiny brick, I've never met someone who can make Lego sound this AB. Totally fascinating. Three hours flew by, like mere minutes. When she leaned against me to get a better angle on the intricate build. My heart raced like I was 16 again and experiencing my first crush. For the next three incredible months, my entire life transformed completely. While Sarah went on her twice weekly dates with random strangers, I spent meaningful time with Emma. We Build complex models together, watch classic movies, have actual deep conversations about our dreams, fears, and future aspirations. She remembered tiny details about my work stress, surprised me with my favorite coffee, and genuinely seemed to enjoy every moment of my company. The physical intimacy was absolutely incredible, too. But it was so much more than just that. Emma made me feel genuinely wanted, truly appreciate. She did. Deeply valued as a person. These were feelings I completely forgotten I deserve to experience in a relationship. Then Emma asked the life changing question. Have you ever seriously thought about leaving your wife? I know the situation is incredibly complicated, but I'm falling hard for you. And I think you might be falling for me, too. She was absolutely right. Somewhere between building our 15th intricate model together and her falling peacefully asleep on my shoulder during a late movie night, I realized.

I told Serena immediately, okay, no problem. Friday night. I'm packing when Serena walks in holding her phone like court. Evident. We're going to brunch with my sister tomorrow, then bed, bath, and beyond. You're going? I said, I've got the trip. What trip? The one I told you about three weeks ago. Her face transformed. So you're ditching me for your little boy band? Pretty much, yeah. You'd rather sweat on some hill than support my family. Tyler doesn't ask me about throw pillows. That's when she deployed her favorite weapon. You know, plenty of guys would treat me better. I could walk out whenever I want. I slung my duffle over my shoulder. Okay, doors open. Not yelling, not sarcastic. Just fact. Serena wasn't used to that response. Normally, she'd drop the threat, I'd backpedal, promise dinner next week. This time, I grabbed my charger and walked past her. You're seriously choosing this over me? I'm choosing not to get ambushed. The night before plans I made Three weeks ago. You're selfish.

That's when it happens. A loud clatter comes from under the coffee table. Everyone turns and out walks a cat, a chunky, smug looking orange tabby, dragging a crushed mini quiche in its mouth like it just completed a mission. Amber gasps. Pickles! The cat! Pickles hops onto the counter, knocking over a napkin with three more stolen quiches underneath. Silence. Stunned silence. Amber rushes over and inspects the evidence. Then, like a true crime detective, realizing her entire theory just fell apart, she spins around to me and says, okay, but you could have train the cat. What? I nearly burst out laughing. So now I'm a criminal mastermind with a carb loving feline accomplice? Derek actually nods. Honestly, that'd be kind of impressive. At this point, even pickles looks offended. He knocks over a wine glass and saunters out of the room like he's done his part. Eventually, Amber gives a half apology. Okay, fine. Maybe it wasn't you. But just so you know, silence is suspicious. Cool. Glad to know being an introvert is now A federal offense. The party fizzled out shortly after. I left early with my soda and no keishes and pickles. He followed me to the door and winked.

You're taller, way better than my boyfriend. The crowd cheered. I just left. The next morning, she realized she'd lost more than just me. My girlfriend Maya had this male best friend, Eric, who was always around, always touching her arm, always looking at her like she was his prize. Six months earlier, I'd laid it out clearly. Either put serious distance between you two, or we're done. She cried, promised he was just a friend. And for months, things seemed better. Then came the concert. I busted my ass to get expensive tickets to her favorite band. It was supposed to be our date night. We get through the gates, and the first person I see is Eric, standing there with this smug grin. What's he doing here? I asked, not hiding my irritation. Maya went defensive immediately. Oh, my god, Leo, don't start. He got a ticket from a friend. It's total coincidence. The look Eric gave me, that little victorious smirk, told me everything. This was no coincidence. This was a setup. She lied to me and broken the one promise I'd made. A deal breaker. But I paid for those tickets, so I decided to just ignore them. Stupid plan. Because it's. Maya. And Eric had other ideas. They were all over each other the entire time. Whispering, laughing at inside jokes I wasn't part of. She was putting on a performance. And I was the chump in the background. I wasn't her date. I was just the guy who drove her there. When the headliner came on, the crowd surged forward and Maya started complaining she couldn't see Leo. Let me get on your shoulders, she said, like nothing was wrong. You know I have a bad back. I told hold her, suggesting we move to the side instead. She gave me a five second pout, then turned to Eric with that bright fake smile. Eric will do it. He's strong. Just like that, he's crouching down and she's climbing onto his shoulders. The crowd around us, a bunch of drunk kids, started cheering. She was loving it, playing to them, living her main character moment. And she looked down at me. Since Eric's a few inches taller, she was really looking down. She laughed this loud, ugly sound that cut right through me. See? She shouted, making sure everyone around could hear. You're taller, way better than my boyfriend. The crowd roared their approval. Eric just stared at me with that same mug, punchable face. He'd won. That's when everything went quiet for me. The music, the crowd. Everything just faded. It was this cold, hard clarity hitting me like a freight train. This was it. The final line. I didn't get angry, I didn't yell. I just.

Making a fool of me on another man's shoulders in front of thousands of people. And I smiled because I was done. I turned and walked away. The crowd parted like they could feel the energy coming off me. I didn't look back once I walked out of that venue into the cool night air and felt nothing but relief. The taxi ride home was the best 45 minutes I had in months. My head was completely clear for the first time in ages. I got I back to my apartment, my name on the lease, my furniture, and shot the deadbolt. Then I packed every single thing she owned, used her expensive luggage, did it properly. By midnight, it was like she'd never lived there. Around 2:00am, I heard them stumbling and laughing outside. Her key scraped the lock, then hit the deadbolt. Banging started. Leo let me in. The door stuck. I didn't move. Just watch them on the doorbell camera. Eric trying to shoulder the door like some tough guy and bouncing off like an idiot. Finally, she called my phone. Leo, what's wrong with the door? Nothing's wrong with it. It's locked. I'll unlock it. No! Silence! What do you mean, no? I mean you don't live here anymore, Maya. You found someone way better, so you can go live with him. Your bags are packed. Have a nice life. I could hear Eric yelling in The background. She started sputtering about how I was breaking up with her over a joke. You broke up with us? When you lied to my face and brought him to the concert, I said the rest was just you confirming my decision in front of a few thousand people. I hung up and blocked both numbers. Eventually, they gave up and left. Watch them go on the camera dragging her luggage down the hallway. The next morning, I moved everything to the building's hallway and sent an anonymous text. Your things are in the hall. Six months later, I haven't heard from her since. Their relationship imploded within weeks. their whole dynamic was based on him being the exciting alternative to me. Once I was gone, they had nothing to rebel against. Maya had to move back with her parents without me funding her lifestyle. Eric became the local joke after getting knocked out defending his girl. I saw her recently working as a waitress. When I was on a date, she turned white and immediately left her shift.

Got out slowly, because I've seen enough videos to know how this goes with cops like him. He immediately started destroying my car like a wild animal looking for food. You people are all the same, he said, while throwing my stuff everywhere, acting innocent. But I know you're dealing or stealing. He actually pulled out a knife and started cutting my seats open looking for hidden substances. Your kind is why I became a cop, to protect real Americans from animals like you. What this racist trash didn't know was that I was actually a federal agent. I've been working undercover for six months investigating him. Fifteen black families had filed complaints saying Owens planted evidence to arrest innocent people. One kid jumped off a bridge after Owens framed him and he lost his full ride to college. Another family became homeless fighting fake charges that Owens laughed about. In the station, I had cameras in my earring, my necklace, and even my shoes, recording everything. The investigation team was watching from A van two blocks away. He was about to find out that his most famous arrest would be the one that destroyed him. Owens grabbed his radio and called for backup. I've got a violent black female. She is acting aggressive and probably armed. I literally hadn't moved or said anything. Three cop cars came flying in with sirens, screaming like I was holding hostages or something. His partner Garrett jumped out already pointing his gun at my face and yelling, is this the substance dealer? They always made stuff up like this. Yeah, she matches the description perfectly.

Mom chose her boyfriend Rufus over me when I was 16. He claimed I stole his Rolex, which was ridiculous since he pawned it weeks earlier for casino money. Rufus gave mom an ultimatum that night. Either she goes or I go. Mom didn't even hesitate. She packed my clothes and trash bags while I was at school and changed the locks. When I got home, my stuff was on the lawn getting soaked by sprinklers. I spent three weeks sleeping in a 24 hour laundromat. The owner eventually caught me, but instead of kicking me out, he offered me a job cleaning his other properties. That's how I met Mister Thief, a 73 year old man who was more powerful than I could have thought. His daughter had died at 17 in a car accident years earlier. When he found me scrubbing his toilets at 2:00am for grocery money, something in his eyes changed with in a month, he moved me into one of his vacant luxury condos. Not some rundown unit, but a penthouse he usually rented for $5,000 a month. Mr. Thys brought me dinner every night, helped with homework, and taught me the property business. When other kids were learning to parallel park, I was learning to negotiate lease agreements and manage construction crews. He paid for my prom dress, my college tuition, even walked me down the aisle at my Wedding for five years. He was the father I never had. When he died of a heart attack, he left me everything. 47 rental properties worth $18 million. I was 21 and suddenly one of the largest property owners in the city. I tried reaching out to mom once during those years. Invited her to my high school graduation. She never showed. Drove by the house one Christmas Eve and saw her through the window laughing with Rufus. I knocked for 10 minutes. She looked right at me through the glass and closed the curtain. Mom's sister called me when I was 25. Said mom and Rufus were begging family members for money again, asking if I had anything to spare. They've hit up everyone.

So here's what's happening. I'll do all the talking during the presentation because I actually understand the nuances. So I had to deal with this pretentious douchebag for the next week. Great. He pulled out his phone and started scrolling. Your only job is to write down everything I say for the slides. Every single thing. You are too much of an idiot to think. Anyway, now here's the thing. This dumb kid had a habit of pausing his sentences to say nasty things about others. Like he just started dictating about the Cold War, but then paused to say, wait, hold on. Is that Jessica? Damn, she looks incredible today. Look at those tight jeans. I got a brilliant idea. Open Powerpoint and started typing, figuring I should do exactly what he says. So I transcribed everything he said, even that line about Jessica. In fact, for the next week, Marcus would corner me in the library and dictate while doing literally everything else as I transcribed it all into perfectly formatted slides. Monday session. The Marshall Plan represented. Damn, did you see Brian's outfit today? Looks like a highlighter threw up on him. Tuesday, I swear, Samantha Keeps staring at me. She's obviously down bad for me. Wednesday. Honestly, if I have to hear Peterson talk about his fake Yale degree one more time, I'll lose it by Thursday. I had 20 slides filled with all those comments. I. I asked if he wanted to review what was actually on the slides. His nasty ass comments, but he just said why would I need to review my own words? Just make sure they auto advance every 45 seconds.

My dad died believing I was in federal prison. That's what my stepmother Veronica told him during his final week in hospice care. She had convinced the hospice staff I was dangerous and shouldn't be allowed to visit. I found out because a nurse broke protocol and called me after dad died. She said Veronica had been telling him for weeks that I was in prison for fraud and couldn't come see him. The truth was I lived 20 minutes away and had been calling the hospice daily begging to see. Two weeks before he entered hospice, while he was still confused from pain medications, Veronica got him to sign a new will. Everything went to her. The house, his plumbing business, 400,000 in savings. All of it. At the will reading, the lawyer said, everything goes to my wife, Veronica. My son gets nothing because he betrayed my trust. I tried to fight it, but my lawyer said without proof of coercion, I had no case. Cost me 5,000 just to hear that. Within a month, Veronica sold dad's plumbing business for cash. While I was sleeping in my car, she posted photos from Miami with her trainer. While I work double shifts at a warehouse. She bought a seventy thousand dollar Mercedes. While I saved every penny. For three years, she was burning through dad's money on failed boutiques and younger boyfriends. I watched It all on social media. The shopping sprees, the ages, the parties. She went through 100,000 in the first year alone. Meanwhile, I bought my first condemned property for 30,000 using a hard money loan. Spent six months fixing it myself after my warehouse shifts. Kept it for 60. Used the profit to buy two more, started renting them. Year 5, she was selling dad's house to cover debts. Year 7, her latest boyfriend cleaned out her accounts and disappeared. Year 8, she had to take a retail job. By year 10, I own 22 rental properties, bringing in 300,000 annually. She was folding clothes at minimum wage. I built everything from nothing, while she destroyed everything.

They ordered three large pizzas. One pepperoni, one veggie, one pineapple, because apparently someone in HR hates. Now, there's an unspoken law when it comes to communal food. If you're not in the room when it arrives, your slice becomes part of The Hunger Games. That's not rudeness. That's survival. That's etiquette. That's biology. So when I walked into the break room and saw one last slice sitting there alone, looking sad, abandoned, practically whispering, take me, I took it like any good citizen of earth would. I folded it like a New Yorker with childhood trauma and took a bite. Then he walked in. Chris from sales. A man whose entire person Mellody is just protein powder and Bluetooth headsets. He entered the room like he just returned from a battlefield. Hair wind blown, shirt unbuttoned at the top like he'd fought a lion. On the way in, he froze when he saw me and the pizza. The room dropped 10 degrees. His eyes locked on mine like I had just eaten his first born. He goes, you. You ate it? And I, stupidly trying to be friendly, said, oh, yeah, hope that wasn't yours. Which is what we all say. When we absolutely hope it wasn't yours. But already

The house I bought. Your mother and I, we never meant for it to go this far. But you let it. For six months, you watched Brooke take credit for my sacrifice. Another call came through. Brooke herself, sobbing. Vanessa, I already hired caterers. I sent embossed invitations to the senior partners. They think I own a lakefront estate. You don't own anything, Brooke. I do, but this will ruin my career. These people are expecting elegance and sophistication. Maybe you should have thought about that before uninviting the person who actually owns the house. Beautiful part. Brooke had already booked the catering, hired servers, ordered custom linens. She'd positioned herself as the hostess of this prestigious lakefront estate, probably bragging about her family's success to colleagues for weeks. Now she had 30 days to explain why she was suddenly homeless. Next text was desperate. Vanessa, I'll pay you back. I'll get a loan. With what credit score, Brooke? After you destroyed mom and dad's? I booked my ticket to Bali that afternoon, first class. Naturally. The money I'd saved from not having to support Brooke's lifestyle anymore was finally working for me. The irony was perfect. While Brooke scrambled to find a new venue and salvage her professional reputation, explain meaning to her fancy law firm friends, Why? The lake front house was suddenly unavailable. I'd be watching sunsets over the Indian Ocean. My phone kept buzzing with increasingly frantic family messages, but I was already mentally checked out. Then came the final text from Brooke. Vanessa, they're all asking questions. My boss wants to know why I can't host anymore. What am I supposed to tell them? Tell them the truth.

Look, I love my family, but hosting Thanksgiving for five years straight has turned me into their personal servant. Last year was when I finally snapped. My sister Jen showed up three days early with two suitcases like she was moving in. She immediately claimed my couch, turned on Netflix, and announced she was on vacation mode. My brother Rick brought his twin boys, who are 7 and treat my house like it's Chuck E. Cheese. The first morning, I woke up to find chocolate fingerprints on my white walls and goldfish crackers ground into my carpet. When I asked Rick to clean it up, he just shrugged and said, kids will be kids. Then my mom arrived with a list of everything wrong with my house. The guest towels weren't fluffy enough, the dining room needed better lighting. She even made me drive to three different stores to find the exact cranberry sauce she wanted. But the absolute worst part was the Thanksgiving night. After I spent eight hours cooking a Turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, green bean casserole, and two pies, everyone ate and immediately scattered to the living room. I'm talking dirty plates everywhere, gravy spilled on my good tablecloth, and Turkey bones just left sitting there. My husband Jake and I cleaned for three hours while everyone else watched football and complained that the TV was too quiet. Next morning, Rick's Kids ate the entire leftover pie I was saving for Jake's parents who were coming that weekend. When I got upset, Jen rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic over dessert. That's when I lost it. I told everyone they needed to leave by noon, that I was done hosting. Fast Forward to this year in September. I told them I needed a break and suggested we rotate hosting or go to a restaurant. Mom immediately said my house was the most comfortable and I was being selfish. Jen said her apartment was

Six months ago, my parents nearly lost their lakefront house because my golden child sister Brooke, racked up massive debts on their credit cards. Who did they call? Me. I liquidated everything. My retirement and my investment portfolio, my rental property. $520,000 gone in one wire transfer to save the house I grew up in. You're our hero, Vanessa. We'll pay you back.

Brooks really blossomed into such a sophisticated woman. You understand, right? Brooke? The same sister who called me jealous when I asked about the $15,000 she borrowed last year. The same one who maxed out Mom's credit cards on networking trips to Cabo. But they didn't know about the paperwork my lawyer made them sign when they were desperate. The loan agreement with very specific terms they'd forgotten about. I opened my laptop and typed one word in the family chat. Okay. Then I called my attorney, Steven. Start the proceedings. They have 30 days. The next morning, I woke up to 17 missed calls. Brooks hysterical voicemail was The Vanessa? What is this? Eviction notice? This is my Thanksgiving dinner. I already sent invitations. Mom's text came next. Sweetie, surely we can work this out. Brooks worked so hard planning this event. Hard work?

Two officers arrived within minutes with paperwork for an emergency hold that he prepared in advance. Brain surgery patients often develop paranoia about their caregivers, he told them, while I tried to explain he'd broken into our house. The officers looked between us, confused. Doctor Eric pulled up medical files on his tablet, showing notes about Haley's increasing hostility toward necessary care. Haley was sobbing, and I moved toward her, but Doctor Eric stepped between us, holding a syringe, saying, this will calm the delusion, sweetheart. Something snapped in me, and I grabbed the baseball bat I kept under our bed with hands that wouldn't stop trembling. Get out of my house! I screamed while my heart slammed against my ribs. The officers put their hands on their weapons, but I, at the bat, raised until everyone backed into the hallway. Doctor Eric stood on our porch after they left and said in this dead voice, I own that brain. I carved every pathway she thinks through. Without me, she's just tissue dying in her. I held Haley on the bathroom floor until sunrise while she shook and asked if she was going to die without him. They revoked Doctor Eric's license after we proved he'd been drugging Haley to create symptoms that required his treatment. But the damage was done. We moved across the country using money I borrowed from my brother and Haley still won't let new doctors examine her. She takes aspirin for headaches that never stopped, and I catch her touching her scar when she thinks I'm not looking. Last month, a medical journal arrived with an article about her case published under a pseudonym. I burned it before she could see, but we both know who wrote it.

The monthly MRIs he insisted on made Haley claustrophobic, but he said skipping even one could mean missing something fatal. I started going to appointments with her after finding him in her office at lunch, checking her pupils because the afternoon light was optimal. My jaw would clench when he'd show other doctors videos of her walking without our permission, but speaking up felt like spitting on a miracle. The breaking point was when he told Haley she couldn't switch to a local neurologist for follow UPS because no one else could understand what he'd done inside her skull. That night, I told her we needed to get away from him, but she was terrified he might be right. Everything exploded the night I woke to find our bedroom door open and Doctor Eric standing over Haley with a portable MRI scanner. My body went cold as he slid the device over her sleeping head while whispering measurements into a recorder. When I shouted his name, my voice cracked, and he looked at me perfectly calm, saying, monthly scans aren't showing the micro changes in tissue density. Haley jolted awake screaming, and I reached for her, but froze when I saw the IV port taped to her arm. When did you put that in Her? I asked, and my hands started shaking as he explained he'd been injecting contrast dye during her sleep for better imaging. He said it like I should thank him for his dedication.

I've never hit anyone in my life, but hearing the crack of his nose breaking felt better. Than any therapy ever could. Will hit the ground hard. My mom screamed. But I wasn't done. 20 years of marriage, 18 years of fatherhood, all stolen from me. You wanna know what's really funny? I said, standing over him. I've been paying for Emily's college fund, her car, everything. Will was holding his nose. Jackson, please. I've been the uncle, I continued. You've been playing dad with my money. That's when Mara finally spoke. It wasn't supposed to happen like this. I turned to her. When did it start? Right after Emily was born, she whispered. You were working so much. Will was always around, helping himself to my wife. Emily came back out.

Figured you could afford it yourself. Or maybe take a train to a public park instead. Loser. What kind of son refuses to help his own family? The kind whose family thinks it's funny to abandon him at an airport, I replied and hung up. They cut their vacation short and showed up at my apartment. Dad threw a suitcase down, face red with rage. How dare you cancel everything? My golf membership, your mother salon, your brother's tuition. I leaned back in my chair. Thought it was funny to leave me stranded at the airport. Well, I'm just returning the favor. We are your family. Dad slammed my coffee table. We raised you. You owe us. I stood up, looking him in the eye. No, I don't. You treated me like a walking ATM and humiliated me. Congratulations. Now you're on your own. Mom started crying. Those crocodile tears. It was just a joke, sweetheart. And this is just a lesson, I replied, grabbing my keys. Good luck figuring things out, losers. Over the next months, reality hit hard. Parents bank account hit zero. They downsized to a smaller house. Dad got a job at a sporting goods store. Mom switched to a budget salon and picked up extra. Alex transferred to community college and got a barista job. They tried guilt trips, apologies, threats. None worked. My health improved immediately. Blood pressure down, better sleep, no headaches. I got promoted, started dating someone who appreciates Me for who I am, not what I provide. I finally took that Hawaii vacation solo. The helicopter tour I'd originally booked for the family was incredible. The pilot asked if I was sad seeing the islands alone. I just smiled. Not at all. For the first time in years, I'm exactly where I want to be. That airport prank was actually a gift. It showed me exactly how they saw me. Not as a son or brother, but as a resource to exploit and mock. Sometimes the healthiest thing you can do is step back and say enough. Real family doesn't treat you like

Mom calls saying my sister told her about the soul thing and maybe I should see a real therapist. I tell her I'm fine at work. My coworker pulls me aside because she googled Celestial Twins and that's not a real thing. Western Google wouldn't understand. I tell her the group chat is blowing up with people sharing psychology articles about shared delusions. My ex texts asking why three different people are asking him about his soul chart. I text back explaining what I told the others that we were Celestial Twins. He responds that I'm a genius because his roommate just asked if he needs cult de programming. However, they're not giving up. At coffee with my best friend, she brings her therapist sister as backup. The sister starts gentle, saying sometimes breakups can cause psychological breaks. It's not a break, we just can't risk the black hole. I explained simply. She insists there's no such thing as spiritual black holes, but I tell her that's exactly what someone who hasn't seen the charts would say. My best friend tries asking if I could date other people only if they're born at least 72 hours apart from my birth time. I explain that's insane. She says that's cosmic safety. I correct her. Game night rolls around again and everyone's there. My roommate announces she actually called the astrologer I mentioned. Everyone stares at her. She says she's never heard of Celestial Twins. She says triumphantly. I shake My head saying, that wasn't our astrologer. Ours doesn't advertise. She only takes clients through spiritual referral. Spiritual referral? She asks. Your Spirit Guide has to recommend you. I explain. My cousin's girlfriend stands up, shouting, this is crazy, and we're both in a cult! It's not a cult, it's just advanced astrology, I say calmly. But then my best friend suddenly shouts for me to stop. Just stop! This is insane! Just tell us the real reason, she begs. I look at my roommate, then at everyone else. Their faces are red, panicked, desperate for the truth. I start laughing, can't stop laughing. We broke up because we realized we're better as friends. I finally say. But the Celestial Twins!

So I'm at brunch, and my best friend starts in again, asking about my ex. Okay, but what really happened between you two? You were together for three years. My roommate jumps in, too, asking if someone cheated. No, nobody cheated. I told them. Then what? You can't just say it didn't work out. Every single hangout becomes the same interrogation. Later, my coworker corners me at work asking if we had some big public because that's what she heard from someone who heard from someone else. My sister calls me because mom thinks I'm hiding something traumatic and she's worried about me. Then my ex text me saying my friend won't get off my ass, asking if I'm okay. This whole thing is getting insane. The breaking point comes at game night at my apartment. Everyone's there, and they start asking if the breakup was about money or sex or some addiction. He doesn't have any addictions. Come on, nobody just breaks up. There's always a real reason. She's as my best friend, nods and adds that they're just trying to help me process everything. My roommate says we need to know whose side we're on. There are no sides, though. There are always sides, she insists. I look around the room, and everyone is staring at me, waiting like vultures for their piece of gossip. That's when I decide if they want the Truth so badly, I'll give them exactly what they deserve. I put down my drink and stand up. You know what? You're right. There is a real reason everyone literally leans forward in their seats. We both got really into astrology during lockdown. Like, really into it. My best friend nods slowly, waiting for more. And we discovered we have the same exact birth time, down to the minute. Same hospital, too. The room goes completely silent. The astrologer we consulted said we're celestial twins. Our souls are literally the same soul, split in half. My cousin's girlfriend says, what? But I keep going. Dating each other would be like dating ourselves cosmically. The astrologer said if we stayed together, we'd create a black hole in the spiritual realm. My roommate's mouth is hanging open. A black hole? She manages to say, in the spiritual realm. Yeah, she showed us.

Sunday evening I got home, Serena was on the couch, arms crossed. Fun weekend? Yeah. Hike, soccer, pizza. You couldn't text me back? Once I saw the texts, didn't have anything new to say. Normal boyfriends check in. Normal girlfriends don't schedule brunches on top of three week old plans. Do you even care if this relationship works? I care enough to want basic planning. No more last minute ultimatums. You make it sound like I'm controlling you. I shrugged. You tried to. I meant it. When I said the doors open, her mouth fell open like she didn't expect me to repeat it for weeks. Serena tried every angle. She'd show me texts from other guys. Brad says I should leave you, so leave. Her friend called. She doesn't mean that stuff about leaving. Then tell her to drop the weekly ultimatum. She tried being sweet. Pancakes, packed lunches, but mentioned soccer plans, and the threats returned. At Thanksgiving dinner with her family, Serena performed her usual speech about how I was distant and selfish. Normal couples spend time together, she told the whole table. Normal couples don't threaten to leave every week. I replied calmly. Her dad set down his fork. If you tell someone you can leave anytime, don't be surprised if they start believing you. Wow. Thanks, Dad. Serena snapped. She stormed out, started packing again. Same weekly performance. Suitcase threats about Brad's place, waiting for me to beg. I Didn't. Maybe I should leave anyway, just to prove a point. What point? That rent's expensive. Finally, she found a studio across town and actually moved out. Tyler moved into the unit next door. Life became simple. Gym, soccer, meal prep. No drama. Two weeks later, late night texts.

Then he ran back up, completely soaked from his waist below, and slapped Dad's face hard. Dad sat up abruptly with his eyes wide, angry at first, until he saw me and my brother burst into tears. Oh, god! What happened? Why are you both wet? Did you go out in the rain? My brother grabbed Dad's phone and handed it to him. Dad, please call 9 1 1 now! Our house is flooded! Dad stumbled out to see the water already creeping up onto the first three steps of the house. His face went completely white as he scrambled to call an emergency hotline. Dad covered us up in raincoats and dragged us all the way up into the attic while we waited for the rain to settle down. Hours later, we climbed onto the roof of The house and sat around while firefighters rescued us and our neighbors on boats and helicopters. They later told my parents that if the water had reached the electrical outlets, it could have been fatal. Your son saved you thousands in damages, maybe your lives.

Up to bed at 9 and slept while my parents drank down wine and did whatever it was adults like to do past 9. By 10:30, my brother confirmed that they passed out hard. He hopped onto the computer and booted it up to play with friends, while I went ahead and really slept. But a little past minute, my brother shook me awake. I saw him staring down at me, fear abundant in his eyes, his hands shaking. Do you hear that? He whispered. Yeah, it's raining a lot, I said. But he shook his head and pointed downward. I put my head onto the wooden floor and tried to find the sound, but it was muffled. He grabbed one of Mom's spare flashlights and peeked out from the room. He rushed back inside the room in a panic, his chest heaving up and down. Oh, god! What do we do? Water had begun seeping under our front door, spreading across the entry. My brother ran to the window and fell back. The entire street was flooded, some of the cars already half Buried in muddy water. The storm drain at the corner was completely blocked and water was rising quickly up our porch step. He ran to our parents room and shook dad hard. Dad! Dad, the house is flooding!

It's Kaliya Elliott and her husband Brian. Both senior partners here. Married 15 years. Usually the picture of professional composure. You forgot again, didn't you? Kalia's voice cracks. 15 years, Brian. Our anniversary. Brian runs his hands through his hair, looking desperate. Kalia, I didn't forget. I swear I didn't forget. Then where's my card? Where's literally anything that shows you remembered? Everyone in the office is tending to work while obviously eavesdropping. It's like watching a car crash in slow motion. That's when I accidentally knock over my toolbox. Screws scatter everywhere. I'm crawling around collecting them when Brian's voice gets quieter. I did remember, Kaylee. I wrote you something. Something real. But the printer ate it three days ago, and I thought it was gone forever. My brain stops. Three days ago, I'd found something wedge deep in the paper feed mechanism. A crumpled, coffee stained piece of paper with handwritten text that had been completely mangled. I glanced at it and tossed it in the trash, thinking it was someone's rough draft. But what if it Wasn't just notes. What if it was Brian's anniversary letter? I abandoned the printer repair and sprint toward the dumpster behind our building. I dive in head first, digging through coffee grounds, soggy sandwich remains, and what I really hope isn't anyone's.

Then the venue called him next day. The phone call came at 7:00am, three weeks before my wedding. Dad's voice was stern. Lily, come to the house now! I walked into my childhood home. Mom sat rigid. Dad stood by the fireplace. Jessica lounged with her smirk. Sit down, Lily, Dad commanded. I remained standing. What's this about your wedding? Mom said coldly. We're not paying for the circus anymore. Seventy five thousand dollars for one day? It's excessive, dad said. We agreed on the budget, I said quietly. Jessica looked up. That was before we realized how much you were wasting. Like that four thousand dollar dress, mom interjected. Who needs Crystal centerpieces? Dad crossed his arms. John works at a non profit. No ambition, no real income. Maybe you should reconsider, mom added. You want me to call off my wedding? Find someone who can actually afford the lifestyle you expect, dad said. Jessica snorted. Living in that tiny apartment really screams high expectations. Dad pulled out a folder. I've called the venue, canceled everything. Deposits are forfeited. My stomach dropped. You canceled my wedding venue? Our name was on the contracts, mom said. We had every right. The caterer, to Jessica added. And photographer and florist. Eight months of planning, all gone. I can't believe you did this. Next time, think before planning something beyond your means, dad said. Understood, I said simply. They expected tears. Arguments. Instead, I gave them nothing and left. The drive back was surreal. 23 years old, NBA from Northwestern, secretly running a 2.8 billion dollar hospitality empire. And my parents cancelled my wedding because they thought I couldn't afford it. I built Phoenix Hospitality Group from nothing. I own 17 luxury

I kept thinking about Hudson. How he helped me pass chemistry last year. How he always smiled and said hi even though we weren't friends. How excited he'd been lately, probably because he thought Angela actually liked him. Two days went by, and I watched Hudson at school. He was different, more confident. He actually raised his hand in class. He sat with people at lunch instead of alone. This fake relationship was the best thing that had happened to him, and Daniela was about to weaponize it. I couldn't let it happen. Four days before the party, I did something that would probably end my friendship with Daniella. I made my own anonymous Instagram account. I messaged Hudson, saying I went to Angela's school and needed to warn him. I told him Angela was fake, that someone from his school was catfishing him and planning something horrible for his birthday. Hudson didn't believe me at first. He said I was probably just jealous or trying to mess with him. So I did something I still feel guilty about. I sent him screenshots that Daniella had sent me. Screenshots showing the back end of the fake account with Daniela's email attached. Hudson blocked the Angela account immediately. He didn't come to school for three days. The day of his party arrived. Daniela still showed up with her laptop in her bag, hoping Hudson would show. But Hudson never came to his own birthday party. His mom apologized to everyone. Saying he had food poisoning. Daniela was pissed. Kept checking her phone to see if Hudson had unblocked Angela. That night, Daniela called me, furious. She figured out someone warned Hudson and suspected it was me. She asked if I was the one who ruined her plan. I said yes. She called me a traitor and said I chose some random loser over our five year friendship. I didn't even know who she was in that moment. I told her she was sick in the head, that she nearly drove an innocent kid to suicide because her ego got roused. I said she was a narcissistic psychopath who shouldn't be allowed near other humans. Monday morning, we were both called to the principal's office. Hudson had gone straight to the administration with all the evidence I'd sent him. He had the screenshots showing Daniella's email on the fake account. He had all their conversation.

The medical checkup started immediately. Blood tests every month, full physiques, detailed scans. They said it was normal for foster kids, but something felt off. Mrs. Smith would watch me eat like she was monitoring my nutrition. Any injury sent them into panic mode. Banning basketball when I scraped my knee, taking my bike when I bruised my arm. We have to keep you in perfect condition, she'd say, like I was some kind of investment. By 17, I'd noticed other things. Mister Smith's locked office drawers, missus Smith's red ink, medical appointments in her planner. Their daughter Lauren asking weird questions about my health and energy levels. On my 18th birthday, they finally revealed their plan. Lauren's kidneys are failing, Mister Smith said, sliding medical files across the dinner table. You're a perfect match. We've been preparing for this moment. The folder contained 3 years of my blood work, compatibility charts, genetic testing, everything needed for organ transplantation.

The guitar lessons, the medical Care the clothes. It's time you gave something back to this family. That's when I remembered the locked filing cabinet in the attic.

Daniela got rejected by Hudson three weeks ago. He's this quiet kid in our chemistry class who mostly keeps to himself. Daniela has been obsessed with him since September. She finally asked him to Winter Formal, and he politely said no. He wasn't mean about it. He just said he wasn't interested in dating right now. Daniela completely lost it. She's 17 like me, but she acted like a psycho ex girlfriend from a Netflix show. She came to my house that night sobbing and saying Hudson humiliated her. I tried to tell her it wasn't that deep, but she wasn't hearing it. She kept saying he thought he was better than her, that he needed to be taught a lesson. A week later, Daniella showed me something on her phone that disgusted me. She'd created a whole fake Instagram I'm account. Some gorgeous girl named Angela from our neighbouring school. She'd been messaging Hudson as this fake girl for five days already. Hudson had completely fallen for it. This kid who barely talks to anyone at school, was pouring his heart out to Angela. He told her about his anxiety, how his dad left when he was 12, how he felt invisible at school and wondered if anyone would ever actually want him. He sent her his artwork that nobody knew. He did these beautiful charcoal drawings of birds and landscapes. He even sent Her poems he wrote about being lonely. Daniela was screenshotting everything. She had hundreds of screenshots saved in a folder on her phone labeled Hudson's funeral. When I saw that folder name, I felt sick. I asked Daniela what she was planning. She got this creepy smile and told me the plan. Hudson's eighteenth birthday was next Friday. His mom had rented out the bowling alley and invited our whole chemistry class. She was trying to help him make friends since he struggled socially. Daniela was going to connect her laptop to the TV screens at the bowling alley. She was going to display all of Hudson's messages for ever. Everyone to see everything. His poems about wanting to disappear. His message about being scared he'd die a virgin. A voice note where he talked about his depression and medication. Photos of his artwork with deeply.

In my family, the eldest daughter was expected to raise every child born after her, not help with, not babysit, but become their actual mother from the moment they arrived home from the hospital. I changed my first diaper when I was 6 years old. You see, my mother was a former teen mom who treated pregnancy like catching a cold, something that just happened to you. My father worked construction, but somehow his paychecks always disappeared into new tools or nights at the bar. They both came from huge families where this was just how things worked. By the time I was 8, I had three siblings under my care. My parents would leave for their date nights while I heated bottles and rocked crying babies. Soon you'll get married and pass the burden onto someone else, my mother would say each time she announced another pregnancy, her eyes landing on me like I was hired help. Fast forward eight years later, when I turned 14, my mother sat me down at the kitchen table with this formal announcement. She was pregnant again. Nothing new, except this time she handed me a notebook labeled Household Schedule with my name listed as primary caregiver from 6:00am to eleven PM your old enough to handle night feedings alone now, she said. My father nodded from his recliner. We cancelled your after school activities. Family comes first. The worst part was when they told me I need to get a work permit to buy diapers because they couldn't afford extras. They called it giving me real world experience. This is what love looks like in our culture, they said. You're so much better with them than we are. My day started at 5:00am, making breakfast for four kids while my parents slept in. I fell asleep during a parent teacher conference. Once my parents told everyone I must be partying. The youngest started calling me Mama at the grocery store and people would give us looks. Came the breaking point. I'd worked so hard to get a full academic scholarship to my dream college. The acceptance letter arrived on a Tuesday. For once, I wasn't an underage mother. I was just Lisa, a normal girl going to a normal college. I was in the middle of happy tears when my mother walked in. I'm pregnant, she yelled. My face dropped. It was twins. That was the same week that my dad decided to be even more neglectful than usual. I had to be the one to hold my mom's hair when she vomited, to massage her feet to fix her pregnancy cravings, all while taking care of the kids. The counselor called the next week saying I needed to submit final paperwork by three PM the baby got sick and wouldn't stop screaming. I missed the deadline by 10 minutes. The scholarship was withdrawn for lack of commitment. My parents said college would have been Selfish anyway, I started planning my escape in secret, applied to community college and got accepted. Got a part time job at a grocery store and hid my money in a tampon box. My 16 year old sister Sarah found out but promised to keep quiet. For once, everything was going according to plan. And so my parents found the acceptance letter I'd hidden in my chemistry textbook. My mother cried about all their sacrifices. My father threatened to kick me out if I abandoned the family. I didn't say a word. And the next day I came home from work to find the house riddled with social workers. Apparently my parents told them I was the neglectful caregiver who was supposed to be watching everyone. The social worker saw through it but gave me an impossible choice. Either I stayed as the primary caregiver or my siblings would go into foster care. My parents stood there smirking like they'd won. But I had an.

I was 20, working graveyard shifts at a 7 11 when I got slammed with a 1,200 dollar DUI that would destroy my entire life. The citation claimed I was driving drunk at 3:00am on Saturday, weaving between lanes and refusing a breathalyzer test. One problem. I don't drink alcohol. I'm a recovering addict who's been sober for three years. Officer Thompson wrote that he pulled me over outside Miller's Bar on Fifth Street. He claimed I reeked of alcohol, had bloodshot eyes, and failed every field sobriety test. But I was restocking energy drinks at 7 11 during my overnight shift. My register transactions showed I sold $847 worth of merchandise between 3 and 4 a m. The security cameras captured me behind the counter at the exact time he claimed I was drunk driving. I couldn't afford a lawyer. A DUI conviction would mean losing my license, my job, and probably going back to jail. So I printed everything. Work schedules, register logs, security footage, time stamps, even my three year sobriety chip. I. I practiced my defense speech until my hands stopped shaking. This was life or death. The courthouse reeked of desperation and broken dreams. I watched person after person accept plea deals for things that would ruin their lives. When they called my name, Officer Thompson walked up looking like he'd done this a thousand times. He was massive, intimidating, with dead eyes. And a bored expression. Your honor, I observed the defendant's vehicle swerving erratically on Fifth Street. Upon contact, the and exhibited classic signs of intoxication. Slurred speech, alcohol odor, bloodshot eyes. He became combative and refused all sobriety tests. Combative? I was working at 7 11, Officer Thompson. When it was my turn, I started carefully. Officer Thompson, what kind of car was I driving? He looked confident. Blue Ford sedan. Your honor, I don't own a car. I've never owned a car. I take the bus to work every night because I can't afford insurance.

So my friend group had this one girl, Jenna, who always pulled this annoying move whenever we went out to eat. She'd order the most expensive thing on the menu, get appetizers, dessert, sometimes even multiple drinks. And then when the Bill came, she'd go, let's just split it evenly every single time. The rest of us would order like a basic pasta or sandwich, maybe share some fries, and we'd end up paying for her lobster tail or whatever fancy thing she decided she needed that night. We all complained about it behind her back, but nobody ever said anything to her face because we didn't want drama in the group. Last weekend, we went to this nice Italian place downtown for my birthday dinner. There were six of us total. I specifically picked somewhere that had good food but wasn't crazy expensive because I knew not everyone had tons of money to throw around right now. Everyone ordered pretty reasonably. I got chicken parmigiana for like 18 bucks. My friend Casey got spaghetti and meatballs. Tyler got a pizza to share with his girlfriend. Normal stuff that college kids order when they're trying to have a nice time without going broke. But Jenna, this girl, ordered the seafood platter that was $45, got two appetizers for the table that nobody asked for, ordered three different cocktails throughout the night and finished it off with some Fancy tiramisu that cost 12 bucks. I watched her racking up this massive Bill and I could already see where this was heading. When the server brought the check, Jenna immediately grabbed it and started doing her fake concerned math face. Okay, so with tip, this comes to about $320. So that's like $53 each, which honestly isn't too bad for a nice place like this. I looked around the table and everyone was just staring at their phones or suddenly very interested in their water glasses. Nobody wanted to be the one to call her out, even though I could tell they were all thinking the same thing I was. That's when I decided I was done enabling this behaviour. I pulled out my phone and opened the calculator app right there at the table. Actually, I'm just gonna pay for what I ordered plus my share of tax and tip. I started adding up my stuff out loud. So my chicken parm was 18. I had one Coke which was 3:50 and my portion of tax and tip comes to about $26 total. The whole table went dead silent. Jenna's face turned bright red and she started stuttering, but we always split everything evenly. That's how we do it in our group. I pulled out $30 cash and put it on the table. Well, I'm changing how I do it. This covers my food and I'm being generous with the tip. I grabbed my person, stood up. Thanks. For dinner, everyone, happy birthday to me, I guess. As I was walking out, I could hear Jenna frantically trying to recalculate the Bill for everyone else. Apparently, my $26 suddenly became everyone else's problem when they realised they'd have to cover her expensive taste. Tyler texted me later that night saying they ended up sitting there.

When I was 15, my older brother Eric left home after this huge screaming match with our dad. Dad had always been super strict about everything, grades, curfew, chores, you name it. But Eric was 18 and wanted to do his own thing. You know, they got into it over something stupid like Eric staying out past midnight on a weekend. I remember standing at the top of the stairs listening to them yell. Dad was going off about respect and responsibility and Eric was shouting back about how nothing he ever did was good enough. Then dad said the words that still give me chills. If you walk out that door, don't bother coming back. Eric grabbed his backpack, stuffed some clothes in it and slammed the front door so hard the whole house shook. Mom tried calling him that night, but his phone went straight to voicemail. She left like 20 messages. Dad just sat in his recliner watching TV, acting like nothing happened. But I could tell he was waiting for Eric to come crawling back. We all were. Days turned into weeks. Mom would set an extra plate at dinner out of habit, then quietly put it away. She'd leave Eric's bedroom door open and sometimes I'd catch her just standing there staring at his unmade bed. I had never talked about it, but he started checking his phone constantly, probably hoping for a text. Or something. I kept thinking Eric would show up for my birthday in October or maybe Thanksgiving when Christmas came and went with no word. I figured he was just being stubborn. Maybe he got a job somewhere. Maybe he had a girlfriend. Maybe he was living his best life and just didn't want to deal with family drama. Mom would cry sometimes when she thought nobody was looking. She sit at the kitchen table late at night staring at her phone waiting for a call that never came. Dad would find her there in the morning and they'd have these weird quiet conversations that stopped when I walked in. Years went by. I graduated high school, started college. Sometimes I'd wonder if Eric even knew I existed anymore. I used to imagine running into him at a gas station or something and he'd be all successful and happy and we'd laugh about how stupid that fight was. I pictured him having kids someday that I'd never meet. The hardest part was how dad changed. He got softer with me. Like he was scared I'd leave, too. He'd ask about my friends, my classes, even offered to help with homework. He didn't understand. It was nice but also weird because I could tell he was thinking about Eric the whole time. Then I turned 21 and everything fell apart. I was at my apartment when this cop showed up at my door with an envelope they've been trying to reach My parents but couldn't get through. The letter was from the state police and it had Eric's name on it. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely read it. They'd found remains behind this old abandoned gas station about two towns over. Dental records confirmed it was Eric. The estimated time of death was about a month after he left home. Six years. Been dead for six whole years and we never knew. I drove home and found mom in the kitchen making dinner like any other night when I told her.

I used to sneak into my college cafeteria at 2:00am to steal leftover pizza. One night I walk in expecting it to be empty and there's this cop sitting at a table drinking coffee and eating a donut like it's totally normal. Officer Jenkins just looks at me and goes, you're either really brave or really stupid. I freeze like a deer in headlights thinking I'm about to get arrested. But then he stands up and says, let's see how good you really are at this. I'm confused until he points to the kitchen and goes, you think you can sneak past me to get that pizza? Let's find out. This guy just turned my midnight snack run into some kind of weird game. He starts counting to 10 and tells me to run. I'm sprinting through the cafeteria like I'm in a spy movie, diving behind soda machines and crawling under tables. Jenkins is walking around pretending to look for me, but he's being super dramatic about it. He's checking the freezer going, hmm, where could she be, while I'm literally hiding behind a trash can three feet away. After like 10 minutes of this, he finds me crouched behind the salad bar. Instead of being mad, he starts laughing and slides a leftover donut across the counter. Not bad, kid, but you knocked over a chair. Work on your stealth. I thought that was the end of it. Wrong. Two weeks later, I find a sticky note on my dorm door that says, next time, bring a friend, OJ this man really just challenged me to up my game. So I convinced my roommate, Lisa, to come with me the next time. We show up at 2:00am and Jenkins is there again like he's been waiting. Ah, you brought back up. This calls for Level 2. He pulls out these fake handcuffs made from cafeteria straws and starts chasing us around the dining hall. Lisa is screaming and I'm dying laughing while we're running between tables. He arrests both of us and makes us sit in the corner for five minutes before letting us go with leftover cookies. This became a weekly thing. Jenkins would leave me notes with increasingly ridiculous challenges. Can you steal a banana without touching the floor?

You mean to tell me a star just randomly disappeared overnight? Look at this. Who invited Galactus to our universe? And scientists are saying a star 2.5 million times brighter than the sun just vanished from our scopes. Vanished with no supernova. Hell nah. We either got someone eating stars or there's a glitch in the universe. Take your pick. We're cooked either way. But hey, at least we know we're safe, right? Nope. Since it was so far, it happened 75 million years into the past, which means Galactus could already be in the neighborhood. We'd never even know what hit us. No supernova, no final moment, just lights out. And we're really out here buying matcha lattes and the boo boos while something out there is snacking on whole ass stars? And if it's eating stars like that, what do you think it does to planets? And we're out here thinking nukes make us powerful. We build rockets and pat ourselves on the back. Meanwhile, something's out there crushing suns like grapes. Our biggest flex is splitting atoms out there. They're splitting galaxies. Actually, to be fair, we have made something no alien could compete with, no matter how big the air fryer. So at least we have that while our son is getting burped up. Follow for more daily rants.

What do you mean by that? I stared at my Uber driver, Carlos. We just pulled up to my apartment complex after a long day at work. But instead of ending the ride, he was studying my building with genuine concern. Ma'am, I've driving for five years and something's not right here, he said quietly. There's a black sedan that's been following us for the past 20 minutes. Same car, keeping exactly three cars behind us the whole drive. He just pulled into your parking lot right after we did. I turn to look out the back window and my blood ran cold. There was indeed a black car parked under the street light near the entrance with someone still sitting inside watching our vehicle. Carlos continued while keeping his voice low. I first noticed him when we left your office building. I thought it was coincidence, but he followed us through eight different turns, including that detour when I missed the highway exit. Nobody takes that exact route by accident. When I tested him by slowing down, he slowed down. When I sped up, he matched my speed perfectly. My heart started pounding as Carlos pulled out his phone and showed me photos he'd taken at red lights. The license plate was clearly visible and the driver was definitely focused on our car rather than the road. This is going to Sound paranoid, but I think you should call someone before getting out, Carlos said urgently. I've seen this behavior before and people who follow others this systematically aren't planning anything good. The way he's been tracking us suggest he knows your routine and where you live. I tried to think of anyone who might follow me, but I lived quietly with no drama or enemies. Then I remembered recent things that hadn't seemed significant again, the feeling of being watched. The same dark car in my mirrors. My neighbor mentioning someone asking about my schedule. Carlos was scrolling through his driver history when his expression changed to confusion. Ma'am, this is strange. I've had three other ride requests to pick you up from your work address in the past two weeks. But when I arrived, you weren't there. Someone kept calling in rides under your name and then no showing. The realization hit me like ice water.

I said nothing and revealed what she'd hidden for years. When I was 19, my mom remarried Richard and suddenly decided I was too spoiled living in our family home. Time to learn independence, she said, kicking me out so Richard's son Tyler could have my room. My childhood bedroom became his gaming setup overnight. I'll never forget packing my stuff while Tyler lounged on my old bed, already planning where to put his new desk. Mom stood in the doorway with her arms crossed, explaining how this would build character. The same woman who used to make me hot chocolate when I had nightmares with now treating me like a burden she couldn't wait to get rid of. I crashed on couches for months. My friend Jake's mom let me sleep in their basement, but I felt like such a charity case. I worked three jobs. Morning shift at a coffee shop, afternoons at a retail store, nights doing delivery driving. I'd see families eating dinner together through restaurant windows and feel this hollow ache in my chest. Mom would post family vacation photos with Tyler in my old spot at the dinner table. Disney World trips, beach houses, fancy restaurants. Tyler wearing my old high school Letterman jacket in one photo. Really stung like I never existed. The worst part was running into them at the grocery store. Mom would get this awkward smile and ask how I was doing out there in the real world while Tyler stood behind her wearing brand new clothes. Meanwhile, I'm calculating if I can afford name brand pasta sauce. This week, I finally saved enough to rent a tiny studio apartment above a pizza place. The walls were thin, it smelled like pepperoni constantly, and the heat barely worked, but it was mine. I'd fall asleep listening to Tyler's Instagram stories about his awesome new room and best mom ever. During this time, I was the only one who visited grandma regularly. Every Sunday, I bring her groceries and we'd watch old movies together. She never asked why I looked so tired or why my clothes were getting loose from skipping meals. She just made sure I ate a real dinner every week and sent me home with leftovers. Grandma would tell me stories about growing up during the depression. How her family stuck together no matter what. Real family doesn't abandon each other when times get tough, she'd say, patting my hand. I always wondered if she knew what mom had done to me. Five years crawled by like this. I bounced between apartments, worked my way up to assistant manager positions, slowly built a small emergency fund. Mom would occasionally text on holidays. Generic thinking of you messages that felt more like obligation than love. Then grandma died suddenly. Heart attack in her sleep. At the funeral, mom cried dramatically while Tyler stood there checking his phone. I Was the one who held Grandma's hand during her final hospital visit. I was the one who knew she wanted to be buried next to Grandpa, wearing her blue dress. A week later, the lawyer called. Grandma had left me everything. Her house, her savings, her vintage jewelry collection that I'd always admired. The reading of the will was surreal. Mom kept shooting me confused glances, like there must be some mistake. But the real shock came when mom

I was 22, living my best life when my phone exploded with calls from my entire family. My cousin Eve, who was 16, told everyone I'd been sneaking into her room and that she was now pregnant with my baby. The whole family believed her instantly. My parents screamed at me over the phone, calling me disgusting. My siblings blocked me on everything. Even my grandparents who raised me wouldn't take my calls. I had zero proof it wasn't true. Eve was the family princess. I was just a black sheep cousin who barely came around anymore. The accusation spread like wildfire through our tight knit extended family. Aunts and uncles who used to invite me to barbecues suddenly acted like I didn't exist. My mom's sister, Eve's mother, posted critical Facebook statuses about protecting our children from predators in our own family. Within a week, I was completely erased from every family group chat, every holiday plan, every graduation announcement. The next year destroyed me completely. I waited every day for police to show up at my door with handcuffs. Every knock made my heart stop. Every phone call from an unknown number sent me into a panic attack. I lost my job at the auto shop because I couldn't focus, kept making mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss finally sat me down and said, whatever was going on? At home, needed to stay there, but I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment three months later when I couldn't make rent, moved in with a buddy who let me crash on his couch. But even he started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Started drinking heavily just to sleep, then drinking to get through the day, then drinking because breathing felt impossible without it. Dating became a nightmare. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried to date asked to meet my parents. After 2 months, I made up some story about them being dead. Second girl saw through the lies when she noticed I had 0 family photos, no childhood stories, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. And when I couldn't give a straight answer, she was gone by morning. The isolation was crushing. Holidays were the worst. Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call. I'd drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway knowing they were all inside without me. I finally moved three states away and started completely over. New job, new friends, new identity. Told everyone I met that my family lived far away and we weren't close. Simple, clean lie that people accepted. Got into therapy, got sober, worked my ass off to build something resembling a normal life.

I froze in the chair, Scissors still hovering over my head. What missing person poster? I asked, but Tony was already walking to the window. He pointed at a flyer taped to the glass outside his shop. That one missing guy named Jake Morrison. Same eagle tattoo on the left shoulder blade. Same scar through the wing from what I can see. My stomach dropped because my name was Jake Morrison, and I definitely had that exact tattoo. Tony, that's probably just a coincidence. Lots of people have eagle tattoos. But Tony was shaking his head, studying my reflection in the mirror. Jake, I've been cutting your hair for two years. Never seen your full name anywhere until today. And this poster says Jake Morrison went missing three months ago. He showed me his appointment book. But you've been coming here every month like clockwork. I twisted around to look at the poster through the window. The photo was grainy and taken from a distance, but it definitely looked like me. Same build, same hair color, same general features. This has to be some mistake, I said, but my voice sounded shaky even to me. Maybe there's another Jake Morrison with a similar tattoo. Tony pulled the poster off his window and brought it inside. Says here he disappeared from Portland, Oregon on March 15th. His family is offering a ten thousand Dollar reward. He looked at me. Care. Jake, where were you living before you moved here? I tried to remember, but my memories before arriving in this town were surprisingly fuzzy. I came from the East Coast, I said, but even as I said it, I wasn't sure if that was true. Been traveling around for work. Tony raised an eyebrow. What kind of work? I opened my mouth to answer and realized I couldn't remember what I told him before construction, I said finally, but if felt like a guest. Tony set down his Scissors completely. Jake, this is serious. If this is you on this poster, your family thinks you're dead or kidnapped. There are people looking for you. He pulled out his phone. Maybe we should call the number and clear this up. My heart started racing and I didn't know why. Wait, I said, grabbing his wrist. Let me think about this first. If I call that number and it's not me, I'll be wasting everyone's time. And if it is me? I trailed off because I couldn't finish that thought. If it was me, then I had no memory of having a family or disappearing from anywhere. Tony sat down in the chair next to me. Jake, when you first came to my shop, you paid cash, said you were new in town, starting fresh. But you never talked about where you came from or why you moved here. That seemed normal at the time. But now, he gestured at the poster. Now it seems like maybe you were running from something. Stared at my reflection, trying to remember my life before this town. I had an apartment here, a job at the hardware store, a routine. But when I tried to think further back, everything got blurry. I think I might have been in an accident, I said slowly. My head or something. My memory of the past few years is pretty foggy. That would explain a lot, Tony said gently. Head injuries can cause amnesia. Maybe you disappeared from Portland because you were hurt and confused. Ended up here without remembering who you are. He showed me the poster again. Says here you have a wife and two kids. They've been searching for you for three months. The words hit me like a punch to the. A wife and kids I couldn't remember. People who loved me and thought I was dead. Tony, what if I don't remember them? What if I call this number and these strangers claim to be my family? My hands were shaking now. What if I've built a life here that I have to give up for a life I can't even remember? Tony stood up and locked the front door of his shop, flipping the sign to closed. Jake, we need to figure this out properly. Let me call my brother in law. He's a cop. He can help us contact the right people and make sure This gets handled safely. He was already dialing. If you really are this missing person, there might be reasons why you left that have nothing to do with memory loss. While Tony talked to his brother in law, I studied the missing person poster more carefully. The physical description matched perfectly. 5 feet 10 inches, brown hair, Hazel eyes, 32 years old. Even the birth date was right. But the address listed was completely unfamiliar. 1,247 Maple street, Portland, Oregon. I've never heard of that street in my life. 20 minutes later.

Is Daisy Williams present in school today? My teacher, Mrs. Harra, clicked the intercom button. Yes, the principal's voice echoed. Lockdown now. This is not a drill. The way he said it made my blood freeze. Mrs. Harra shrieked under the desks. Lights off. Move, move, move. Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. I couldn't help but think he was after me. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Missus Harrah tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. The screaming got louder and it wasn't just one voice anymore. Multiple people in different parts of the building. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that the shooter was right outside and I believed them. Pia grabbed my hand and her palms were soaked with sweat. I could see Mister Kids class across the hall through our door window. Lights already off, no movement, just darkness where 20 kids should have been. I looked at our teacher and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids and told us it would be okay. But after a while, She got up again and walked back to her laptop. Then we heard it, footsteps running past our door. Thud, thud, thud. I couldn't help myself. I had to look. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall, pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops. Get, get away from the door, Daisy, Mrs. Harrah whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Even Mrs. Harrah stood up slowly and crept to the door to check the window before opening it. That's when it flung open. The principal stood there with an actual cop who had his hand resting on his gun. You, Daisy, come with us. Immediately, my worst fear confirmed. The tutor had sent them or maybe they thought I was involved somehow. Missus Harrah looked between them and me, confused. Get your things, honey, Missus Harrah said. And that scared me more than anything because in three years of chemistry class, she'd never called me honey. Every single person was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack with shaking hands. The hallway was complete chaos, more cops than I'd ever seen in one place. I heard a paramedic shout, we're losing him. Move as he flew past us. My classmates were pressed against the door windows in every room, watching me get escorted by police like I was a criminal. They steered me to the main office but passed reception. Into the conference room, the cop finally spoke. Your dad is here? Well, my parents are divorced and I hadn't seen him since I was 7. So now I was really confused. Dad. He grabbed me in a hug so tight I couldn't breathe and his whole body shook against mine. I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. My ex Marine father, who always encouraged me to be stoic and suppress my feelings, was crying his eyes out. Sorry for what? What's happening? Is there a shooter? Are people dead? I pulled back to look at him and he held my face in both hands. His hands were freezing. There's no.

The doctor said she had four months with brain cancer, so when she asked to try cigarettes and wine, I figured, why not? She's 16 and dying. Normal rules don't apply. We spent three weeks bonding on the back porch. She'd smoke these little cigarettes I bought her, and we'd split a beer while talking about everything she'd never get to do. It was beautiful. In this twisted way, she seemed more relaxed than since the diagnosis. Those evenings became sacred to us. She'd tell me about boys she had crushes on but never got to date. We'd talk about college majors she'd researched but would never pursue. She wanted to study marine biology. Said she'd always dreamed of swimming with sharks. The irony wasn't lost on either of us that she was more afraid of living than dying. I watched my wife struggle with what we were doing. She'd see us through the kitchen window and her face would crumble. But she never said anything. How do you argue with a dying kid's last requests? How do you be the parent who says no when time is running out? She started taking longer shifts at work, I think to avoid watching us slowly poisoning ourselves. My daughter started sleeping better. The constant anxiety that had consumed her since the diagnosis seemed to fade with each cigarette. She'd lean against my shoulder, and we'd just sit in comfortable Silence. Watching the sunset. I memorized those moments, knowing I'd replay them forever after she was gone. She told me things during those sessions that broke my heart. How she felt guilty for being sick. How she worried we'd spend all our savings on treatments that wouldn't work. She was scared of the pain, but more scared of leaving us behind. I held her while she cried, both of us smoking and pretending it was helping. The strangest part was how normal it felt after a few days. Like this was just what we did now. Father daughter bonding over beer and cigarettes. Because the universe dealt us the worst possible hand. The next morning, Doctor Martinez called while we were having breakfast. She put it on speaker like always, turning the volume all the way up. He sounded strange, like

Our chemistry teacher, Mr. Rodriguez, had this insane rule. If your phone made any sound during class, he'd lock it in his desk for a full week. Not the day, the entire week in your year. Everyone knew someone who'd lost their phone to him. He kept them like trophies in his desk drawer, grinning whenever kids begged to get them back. There was this quiet kid, Marcus, who worked nights at McDonald's to help his mom pay bills. His twelve year old sister, Lily, walked home from Jefferson Middle every day through this sketchy area near the auto shops on Fifth Street. She was supposed to text Marcus the second she got home. One Tuesday, during our midterm, Marcus's phone buzzed just once. A text. Rodriguez didn't even look up from his crossword puzzle. Just held out his fat hand phone. See? See you next Tuesday, Mr. Johnson. Marcus went pale. Please, Mr. Rodriguez, my sister should have put it on silent. Your poor planning isn't my emergency. Marcus actually got on his knees, begged, explained about his mom's double shifts at the hospital, about Lily being alone, about the creeps who hung around that neighborhood. Rodriguez just smiled and slid the phone into his desk. Maybe you'll think twice next time. That afternoon changed everything. Lily never made it home. Some freak in a white van had been watching Jefferson middle for weeks. When she tried calling Marcus first Like she always did when scared. His phone. Phone just rang in Rodriguez's locked drawer. She was missing for four hours. Four hours of Marcus pacing the McDonald's parking lot, checking the time, knowing something was wrong, but having no way to know what. Police found her behind the Valvoline on eighth three. Physically okay, but she wouldn't stop shaking. Wouldn't talk for three days. Marcus came to school the next morning looking like he'd aged ten years. He walked straight to Rodriguez's room during lunch. I need my phone back, he said, voice barely a whisper. Rodriguez was eating a Turkey sandwich. Didn't even look up. Rules are rules, Mr. Johnson. See you Tuesday. Marcus stared at him for a long moment, then walked to the unlocked chemical supply cabinet. Rodriguez was too lazy to secure it properly.

Womp, womp. What do you mean womp, womp? You don't even care. She was your girlfriend for 2 years, Justin. She loved you for 2 years. Listen, Tammy, this is not my problem. She overreacted and did something irrational. That's on her, not me. Justin, you literally broke her heart. How could you after the 2 years of her being there for you when big sis Jessica passed away? That hurt us bad. And she was there for you, making sure you were okay. When you couldn't take me to school because you were too sad to get out of the bed, Emma came to take me. She would always take care of me like how our big sister would before she passed. She would always buy me food, pack my lunch and would even come over to watch me and take care of me when nobody was home. She would stay home with me just to play barbies with me to make sure I wasn't scared being alone. She was the best girlfriend you ever had. She was the sister I needed after big sis passed away.

Yeah, everyone will miss her except Justin. Justin is so evil. How could he do that to her? I talked to your brother, Tammy, and what he did was absolutely terrible and unforgivable. He should be grounded forever. Sadly, I can't do anything since he's a 20 year old man. Mommy, I really think this is my fault. If I would have just shut my mouth, Emma would still be here. But I decided to be a loud mouth. This is all because of me, baby. No, you did the right thing. Don't ever feel bad about doing the right thing. Yeah. Mommy, could you at least take me to see Emma again? I miss her so much. I want to play barbies with her. I wish I could, Tammy, but I'm so tired and I have work tomorrow. Auntie, can you send me a rizzapp line so Mommy can take me? This will for sure make Mommy smile. Say this. My love for you will give you all the energy you need. My love for you will give you all the energy you need. Oh, that's so sweet. You're right. I do have enough energy for one more trip. Meet me at the car. Yay! I'm bringing my barbies. I'm bringing my new barbies to come play with you. Emma, I miss you so much. You were the best thing I had in my life. I will never forget you. And I'll keep that promise that we made at your grave that I will come play barbies with you every single day. I love you so much. Mommy, when will you be back from work? I have to go see Emma again today so we can play barbies. Yesterday was so fun with her. I was so happy I could spend time with her. Sorry, baby, I won't be able to make it home on time because of this snowstorm. But Mommy, I made a promise to Emma that I would never miss a day. I'm so sorry, Tammy, but I can't today. Don't be sorry, Mommy. I won't break my promise to Emma. Wait, honey, what do you mean by that? Tammy? Justin, where is Tammy? I don't know. Why are you asking me? You didn't watch over your little sister? I looked over the entire house and she's not here. And that's my problem. How, oh, my god. I think she went to Emma's grave. Wait. How would she even be able to walk all the way over there by herself in the snow? No time for questions. Get in your car and drive to the cemetery now. Whatever. Did you find anything, Justin?

That her selfish son is trying to leave her homeless while he sits in a house full of things he wouldn't even have without me? You contributed nothing to my success. Nothing! Fine. I'll let myself in. What? No. You really should have hidden your spare key better. How did you even. Oh, and don't bother hiding your bank cards. I already linked my shopping apps to them. You what? I needed a little retail therapy. It's exhausting being me. Where is all my furniture? Sold. I got a really good deal on all of it. Ha ha ha ha! 300 for the entire dining set and TV. Already booked my hair appointment. I'm so excited. No, no, no, no. No comment. Part 3 to see the sun get revenge.

Yesterday, my phone rang at 2:00am. It was the police. Ma'am, we have your 6 year old son, Tommy at the station. He walked here by himself, saying his mommy hurt his baby sister. I shot out of bed. What? Tommy's in his room sleeping. And I don't have a baby sister. Ma'am, please come down to the station immediately. I ran to Tommy's room. Empty bed, front door wide open. At the police station, Tommy was wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The moment he saw me, he screamed, don't let her take me! She killed my sister. My heart stopped. The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, Buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away, too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room while Tommy sobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My Stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. I spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. His little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. Psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy story never changed. Hours passed. Detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She. She showed me the room she made all pink. And pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us? But before I could answer,

And he's just short by a tiny bit. How much is he short? Only 48 thousand dollars. I already told him we'd help. We have plenty of money anyway. A 50 thousand dollar car and he's short forty eight thousand dollars? Is this some kind of joke? Why don't I just buy him the whole car then? Yes, yes. You're the best husband ever. Quick, give me the money! Hold on, he makes $200 a month. How's he going to maintain it? Gas, insurance, repairs. Besides, our own car only cost $20,000. He absolutely must have a car. He's getting married soon. A 50 thousand dollar car gives him so much face. I think when buying cars, you should go straight to the top. Mom, my brother and I already went car shopping and we all agree it's perfect. Hmm. A 50 thousand dollar car. I'm sure it's nice even without seeing it. Hurry up, babe. Give me the money. They need the deposit today. Why am I the one paying? Do you know why I don't let you handle our money anymore? It's precisely to prevent this. When you managed our finances, we were always in the red because you kept funneling money to your family. Now we finally saved a bit and you're pulling this again? You're his brother in law. He's buying a car for his wedding. Such an important event. Just help him out. When He has money later. He'll definitely take care of you. Ha! I'm going to call your brother right now. Call? What for? Hey, brother, your sister's husband here. Got something to discuss with you. What's up, bro? What's going on? So I spotted this great apartment, but I'm short $5,000 on the down payment. Wondering if I could borrow from you. Huh? Don't you already have two apartments? Why buy another one? Look, don't buy it right now. I'm trying to get a car and was planning to borrow $48,000 from you. What? You wanna borrow from me too? And $48,000? I've already paid the deposit on this place. I really don't have extra cash. Are you doing this on purpose? You knew I wanted to buy a car, and now you pull this stunt? Brother, don't get upset. I'm not targeting you. Just trying to understand something. From what you're saying, I should lend you $48,000 without question, but you can't lend me $5,000? Is. Is that the logic here? You've known about my car plans forever. How could I possibly have money to lend you? You won't even lend me $5,000, so why should I lend you $48,000? Isn't that a blatant double standard? Because you're my sister's husband. Oh, so just because I'm your sister's husband, I'm obligated to support you unconditionally? I have zero responsibility toward you. I spent a fortune on our wedding when I married your sister. This isn't even a life or death Situation. I'm done talking to you. I'll ask my sister directly. All our money is with me. Going to her won't help. Listen to me. You will give this money to my brother. Give me the money now! Amy, listen to yourself. This isn't healthy. You know what's not healthy? Watching my brother struggle while we sit in our comfortable house with money in the bank. I guess I finally see where your priorities lie.

Where did you hear that date? It was in the note with Dad's watch. The watch you said was destroyed. Emma, where are you right now? Still at Jessica's. Her mom's about to drive me home. Number? Go to Aunt Claire's instead. Don't come home. You're scaring me. What's going on with these texts from Dad's number? Someone is trying to manipulate you. Your father died in that accident last month. Then why is his watch here? Why does someone know about July 15th? Your father's former partner must have gotten access to his personal effects. What partner? You said dad worked alone. I needed to protect you from certain aspects of his work. There's another text. Ask about the offshore account in the Caymans. Don't respond to any more messages. They're trying to get information. Information about what? What was dad involved in? Your father was an accountant for some powerful people. He found discrepancies. Criminal discrepancies. Was dad in danger? We're in the car now. Jessica's mom is acting strange. She keeps checking her mirrors. Is she taking you to our house or to Claire's? Neither. We're heading toward the lakehouse where the text said to go. Emma, that's not Jessica's mother. The real Carol has a scar on her wrist. She's wearing long sleeves. I can't tell. Ask to use her phone. Say yours is dying. She refused. Said her battery is low, too. Try to get a look at her wrist. Find An excuse. I asked her to check the time. No scar. Mom, who is this woman? Listen carefully. When she slows down at the next intersection, unlock your door and run. She just locked all the doors from her control panel. Is there anything in the car you can use as a weapon? Jessica's field hockey stick is in the backseat. I'm 10 minutes from the lakehouse. Is she still heading there? Yes. She just got a call. She's speaking another language. Sounds Eastern European. Your father's files exposed an international money laundering operation. Dad was just an accountant. How did he get involved in this? He was recruited specifically because of his skills. He didn't know what they were hiding. She's pulling over at the convenience store. Says she needs cigarettes. This is your chance. Get out while she's inside. I can't. She took the keys and told me she'll be watching through the window. Check the glove compartment. Is there anything useful? There's a gun, mom. A real gun. Don't touch it. It could be a setup. She's coming back. She's talking to someone outside the car. Take a photo of them. Discreetly, if you can. Done. Sending it now. That's Andre Kozlov. He worked with your father's firm. We're driving again. They're taking me to the lakehouse. The watch, Emma, is there anything unusual about it? The back has a small SD card taped to it. I never noticed before. That's what they want. Your father must Have copied the evidence. Should I destroy it? No. It's the only leverage we have. It's evidence of their entire operation. We're at the lakehouse. There's a black SUV waiting. I'm two minutes away. Can you see who's in the SUV? It's Mister Peterson from Dad's office. The one who spoke at his funeral. He's the one who recruited your father. He's been leading this whole operation. She's making me get out of the car, stall, ask questions, keep them talking until I get there. Peterson says he just wants the watch and we'll be safe. He's lying. They can't leave witnesses. He's showing me a badge. FBI. Is that possible? Huh? Boost for part three.

My high school bully, Jake, tormented me for three years straight. He wasn't your typical bully who just shove you into lockers. No, Jake was calculated. He made sure none of the teachers ever saw anything while systematically destroying my social life. It started sophomore year when I transferred to Westlake High. I didn't know anyone, so I was already nervous. Jake was the star quarterback, student body president, and principal's son. The untouchable golden boy. For reasons I'll never understand, he decided I was his target. At first, it was small stuff. Accidentally knocking my books down, spilling soda on my homework, or spreading rumors that I had weird hobbies. But by junior year, he'd orchestrated my complete isolation. The few friends I'd made suddenly stopped talking to me after Jake told everyone I'd said horrible things about them behind their backs. I ate lunch alone for a year and a half. What kept me going was art. I poured everything into my sculptures, staying late in the art studio almost every day. Miss Porter, our art teacher, recognized my talent and even gave me a key to work weekends. Art became my refuge. In your year, everything changed when the state announced their annual art competition with a 20 thousand dollar college scholarship prize. This was my ticket out. My family couldn't afford college otherwise. Miss Porter encouraged me to enter, saying, my metal work sculptures, Were the best she'd seen from a high school student. For three months, I worked on my masterpiece, an intricate wire sculpture showing two hands breaking free from chains. It represented everything I've been through. The detail was incredible. Each link in the chain had tiny engravings of the words that had been used against me. Two weeks before the submission deadline, I walked into the art room and froze. My sculpture lay smashed on the floor, the hundreds of hours of work destroyed beyond repair. On my desk was a yellow sticky note. Oops. Clumsy me, Jay. I felt something break inside me, but not in the way Jake expected. Instead of crying or reporting it, which would have done nothing since his dad ran the school, I smiled and calmly cleaned up the mess. The next day, I started a completely different project. A technically impressive but intentionally bland wire figure of a tree. Basic, safe, uninspired. What Jake didn't know was that after the destruction, I'd convinced Miss Porter to let me install a small security camera in the art room to prevent further accidents. I also set up a second hidden camera, pointed directly at my supply drawer, where I kept all my original design sketches and concept art. For the next two weeks, I worked on my decoy project during school hours, making sure everyone saw me starting over. But at home in my garage, I was recreating my masterpiece. Been better than before. Three Days before the deadline, the security footage showed Jake sneaking into the art room at night using a key he must have taken from his dad's office. He went straight to my supply drawer, stealing all my original design sketches for my destroyed sculpture. The day before submissions were due, Jake unveiled his original creation in art class.

You always used to plan ahead. Why nothing for my birthday this year? You never liked the gifts I got before, right? Figured cash would be better. Money is what matters anyway. Better to focus on making more dollar than stressing over gifts. You've grown up. I knew you were the best. I'll be home early tonight, babe. Heading home now. I had a bit too much feeling dizzy. I'm home. Babe. You're not here. Where'd you go? Still at work. Overtime, tons to do. Deadline tomorrow. Go to bed. I'll be back when I'm done. Babe, my head's killing me. Okay, noted.

Why are you unhappy now? You've got it all wrong, babe. This isn't what I wanted. I want you to be your old self again. The girl who only had eyes for me.

You have until June to figure out who I am. Is this just a way to get me to talk to you all year? Maybe. Alright, sure. Why not? But I gotta let you know, I do have a crush on a girl already, so don't get your hopes up. That's okay. Let's just see what happens. Hey. You looked great today. You were watching me? You're creepy, you know that? Rizz app tells me to respond with how could I take my eyes off such a beautiful specimen such as yourself? How could I take my eyes off such a beautiful specimen such as yourself? Wow, that was actually a good one. Describe yourself to me a little. Why? So I can at least get a starting point to find out who you are. Okay, fair enough. I'm blonde. That doesn't help me. There are tons of blonde girls in our school. Be more specific. Alright. I have a birthmark on my left shoulder. Hmm. Interesting. Now all I have to do is go around looking at Blonde girls. Shoulders. Lol. So tell me about this girl you like. Her name is Sienna. She's beautiful, but we've never spoken. Do you know her? Yeah. Lol. I know her. She is pretty awesome. Maybe when I find out who you are, you can introduce me to her. Yeah, sure. Why not? Okay, well, I'm gonna get some sleep. Good night, mystery girl. Good night. What? I didn't get a message today. Ah. Does someone miss me? In your dreams. I was just surprised you haven't messaged me, that's all. I have a question for you. Sure, go ahead. How could you have loved me for so long if we have never even spoken? I think you're gorgeous. I see how you interact with people. You're such a gentle soul. You're polite, a gentleman. I just always knew you are exactly what I want. Wow, that's really sweet. I wish I could figure out who you are. Patience. Hey. Hey. Can I admit something to you? Of course. I don't think I'm interested in Sienna anymore. Oh, really? How come? She's beautiful. So beautiful that I've never been brave enough to even speak to her. But that's the problem. Physically, she's perfect in every way. But I've fallen for someone else. Someone who I do speak to. Someone who understands me. And I don't even know her name or what she looks like. The day you find out who I really am, I hope we can be together. Me, Too mystery girl? Honey, did you know a girl named Sienna in your school? Yeah, she's in my class. I used to have a crush on her. Lol. Why? I just saw on the news that she passed away. So sad. What? Are you kidding? No, honey. Did you know her well? No, we never spoke. That's so sad. She seemed really nice. I'm sorry, honey. Hey, did you hear about Sienna? Hello? Mystery girl, you there? Why aren't you replying? I could really use someone to talk to right now. Did you change your number? Why aren't my messages going through? It was you. It was you all along, Sienna. How could I have been so shlind? I wish I had spoken to you. I'm an idiot. I should have just picked up the courage and spoken to you. I love you, Sienna. I always will. Fly high, my mystery girl. James, I need your help.

I hope you slept well. If you count sleeping in the back of a van sleeping well, then I guess you could say I did. Oh yeah. Haha, I forgot about that. Hey, I have a question. Go for it. What's in your notes that is so important? Oh my god, stop! You can't look. I won't, but I'm curious now. Haha. Well, how about this? At the end of the trip, you can open my notes app on one condition. Which is? You tell me who your crush is. Oh, I think I could work with that. Yay! So where did you guys road trip to? We just got to Baltimore. No way! I have family there. Could they meet you and get my phone? Oh, I mean, we are just about to leave now. I don't think we can. Haha, I'm just messing with you.

Your message notification can wake up my whole house, let alone just me. Haha, yeah, it is a pretty loud one. So can I go on the notes app yet? Not just yet. Have some patience. You can do it when I'm an hour away from home. And how long is that gonna be? Well, for starters, I'm six hours out. Oh my god. So long. For what? This better be good. Hopefully you like it. Me? Why would I like it? Oh, I don't know. I mean, just like after the wait. I hope you like it. I see. Well, I never thought I would be texting myself, but I will say this has been pretty fun. Same to you, Adam. Yeah, I was going to complain to the school about getting our phones mixed up, but I guess I'll cut Them a break this time. Ha ha. This time. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. If it's with you, I wouldn't mind. Okay, Adam, we are going back to a no service area. I'll text you when I'm close. Okay. Hey, Adam, I'm one hour out. Omg! Yay! Can I open it? Yeah.

It was still very inappropriate, Alex. You're overreacting, Miss Chase. Also, you aren't allowed to leave my classroom until you're finished. Bruh, I thought when you said come prepared, you meant something else. You're making things worse for yourself. When you finish writing your apology, go home. I'll read over it tomorrow morning.

I do have one issue with your apology, though. What is it? I told you to staple the paper together, not glue it. Oh, right, yeah, that's my bad. I was really tired after writing that apology. It's fine. Although next time, use the glue in my classroom. The glue you used was almost impossible. To wash off. Sorry. Also, one more thing. Could you tell Crystal to start doing her math homework? Why can't you do it? Things are rough at home and she won't listen to me. I don't know about this. Please, Alex. If you do, I'll give you a special reward tomorrow. How does a private lesson sound after school? Wait, really? I promise. Okay. I just told her to start doing her homework. What did she say? She said she'll do it. So I guess I'll see you tomorrow after school. Miss Chase, comment for part three?

What's your emergency? Hi. Yes, I'd like to order a pizza for delivery. Pizza? I think you've dialed the wrong number, ma'am. I don't think so. Do you still have the cheesy crust? The address? Sure. It's 2 3 5 Haywood street, apartment 3F. Ma'am, are you in danger or someone making you feel like you can't speak freely? That's right. I understand. My name is Grace. Okay. And help is on the way. I need you to tell me how many people are in the apartment. Would a medium pepperoni pizza be big enough for two people? What are you doing? I said large. Uh, okay, so there's one other person with you. Is that who I'm hearing? Yes, that's right. Okay, you're doing really great. Can you tell me your name for the order? Um, the name on the card is Kristen. Smart. Okay, Kristen it. Is the person threatening you armed? Mm hmm. Move the pot. Come on. Okay, if he's armed with a gun, I want you to ask for extra pepperoni. Extra pepperoni would be great. And, Kristen, is this person known to you? Yes. Okay. Spouse? Ex spouse. The second one. How long until you get here? We're looking at about eight minutes. Uh, say peppers if there's somewhere safe you can get to. No. Definitely no peppers. It's a pizza, not a damn salad. Uh, listen, I might just have to cancel this order. My boyfriend's getting kind of mad. So. Okay, listen, Kristen, I will have officers at your door in under two minutes, okay? I really need you to try and stay on with me, okay? I think I can do that. Okay, good. Now, I need you to try to move as far away from the door as you can. Can you tell me if he's facing it? The door

Other families save money for medical expenses. This family has to save money for bail because I am raising a fucking criminal. Yesterday, I posted a video about how my 3 year old daughter stole candy from a store. And I. I know it could have been worse. But today it was worse when she tried to steal a whole fucking baby. I have a rule in the store. While we are shopping, if you are walking, you have to have your hands on the cart. My other daughter had two hands on the cart to trick me so that her sister could go get a baby brother. This poor woman was just trying to pick out the right type of toilet paper. My sweet, innocent little daughter just comes up and kidnaps her son. The worst part about all of it. Okay, it's gonna sound horrible, but the mother and her child were black, okay? So when my daughter come running up to me with this child, she says, Mommy, Mommy, can we keep the chocolate baby? I have never been so embarrassed in my life.

And if he hits you with that little, oh, I'm so sorry, I was busy, that is just the biggest excuse in the book. Because nobody is too busy to text the person that they like or love. Like me personally, I would never do that. Because here's the thing. Even if I am busy throughout the day, I'm going to check my phone because I have a priority, and that priority is you. If I am gonna be busy, and I know I'm gonna be busy, I'm gonna text you and be like, hey, if I don't reply that fast, it's because I'm going to be doing this. Because it goes down to that. Saying, if they wanted to, they would. It takes like five seconds for me to get on my phone and text you, hey, I'm going to be busy. If I don't reply, that's why I will text you back as soon as I get the chance. It's called communication. Because honestly, if I really like or love somebody, I'm not gonna let them overthink all day, because I'm not replying to them, because I wouldn't want that done to me.

Then why the fuck aren't we allowed to hit them? So let's not talk about fighting when you look like you could fit in my pocket. Especially cause I have shoes that are older than you. Every time we talk about women's rights, you wanna know why you can't hit us, but you're not allowed to hit anyone? Problem is, you're just not as enthusiastic about hitting men because you know you won't win. And if you need to hit a five foot tall girl to feel like a man, then you probably need to re evaluate yourself. But if you wanna talk about strength, let's do that. Because women can run entire households while shedding a lining of their uterus. Meanwhile, you can't peel yourself off the couch when you have a cold, she's got blood running down her leg, and you can't handle a runny nose. We are not the same. Have you ever had a yeast infection? Cause I'd love to see you work a 9 to 5 job when your labia itches so badly you can feel it in your ears. Or you ever seen a pregnant woman breastfeed a baby? Cause that means that every nutrient in her body is going to sustain other people's lives, but not her own. And yet somehow her husband's the one that needs a nap. So let's stop worrying about our strength and start worrying about your weakness.

I don't want you catfishing me, okay? That's the first thing. Step No. 4, you gotta have zero kids. I ain't taking care of nobody's kids. What the fuck do I look like?

The day before my daughter was going into kindergarten, her father and I listened to the worst news of our lives. We spent the next six months in the hospital with her before she passed away. My husband and I split up shortly after and I was alone for years. But one night after I got home from work, I sat on my back porch remembering how she used to play in our backyard. I noticed something stuck in a bush around the side of my house. And when I got closer, it was a pink balloon. I was just gonna throw it out but saw it had a note taped to the side. I opened it and could see a message written in crayon. It was really hard to read, but it said, happy Birthday, Mommy, I miss you. Please send me a sign. Love Callie. I was confused at first, but then I realized what it was. Whoever this little girl was had lost her mom and was sending her a message. I asked around my neighborhood later that week and found what house she lived at. I talked to her father and told him I found one of her balloons. He apologized and said she had been doing that for a while. She was 6 and lost her mom two years before. I told him about my daughter and how I would love to write back to her. Just in case it would cheer her up, I wrote her a note that said, hi, Kelly, I found your balloon. I miss you and I'm watching over you every day. Love, Mommy. The next night he called me and told me she was so excited she sent another balloon up. And he asked if I could do it again. After a week, he asked me to meet her. And she was the sweetest girl I've ever met. Five years later, she's now my stepdaughter. But this morning she said something I'll never forget. She told me she thinks she has two mommies, one up there and one who found her balloon.

I had a crush on a girl for five years and in high school I finally convinced her to go out with me on our first date. I quickly realized how insanely wealthy her parents were and I had no idea. I grew up with basically nothing. So I thought if she ever found out, she'd break up with me. I hit it pretty well for a few months and she literally had no idea I worked the night shift at McDonald's. When she asked what I did, I lied and told her I ran my own company, which made her like me even more. Almost every time we'd eat somewhere, she always made jokes about how the people working there were losers. So I knew she'd for sure leave me if she found out. I thought maybe she wouldn't care if I waited a few months. But before I could gain the courage to tell her, she asked me to meet her parents. I was extremely nervous that day and had to work an 8 hour shift before I went over. I was running on two hours of sleep and just barely made it to their house in time. I could tell they really liked me and when they asked about my company, I continued to lie and said I was already really successful, everything was going good. But when we sat down for dinner, they asked me to say a Prayer before we ate, my two hour sleep was really starting to hit me. So when I closed my eyes, my brain took over. I wasn't thinking at all. And in front of her entire family said, thank you for choosing McDonald's. May I take your order? I immediately realized what I said and looked up at them. They were confused at first but quickly figured it out. She broke up with me that night and I'm now dating her sister.

My parents were so worried about me dating a skater boy. They couldn't imagine he'd be the reason I'm still alive today. A few nights ago, my parents found out about my skater boyfriend, Gregs, when his message popped up on my screen at dinner. I love you, too. Who the heck are you talking to? My mom shouted, glaring at the screen of my phone. You're 14. No dating until you're 30. We were very clear. Dad pulled up Reggis's Instagram on his own phone. A skateboarder? Really? This is who you're risking your future for? I tried to reason with them, but they refused to listen and forced me to block him everywhere, right there, over dinner. You'll thank us when you're in college, mom said while I sobbed. My friends tried passing messages between us at school. Well. But my parents found out and threatened to call their parents. Eventually, everyone gave up, except for Gregus. Gregus showed up mysteriously in my valorant lobby. Hey, Mel. It's been a while, he said, his voice breaking. I miss you, Mel. I know we're not supposed to talk, but let's at least play like we used to. We started meeting in the lobbies every day after that, just playing and chatting about normal things. School friends, my strict parents. He never once tried to convince me to sneak around or meet up in person. He never complained. About my parents or tried to turn me against them. When I'd vent about how unfair they were being, he'd actually defend them. Sometimes they're just scared, Once my older sister got mixed up with some bad people in high school. Parents get paranoid. He still cared about me in all the ways that mattered. When I failed my chemistry test because I couldn't focus, he spent three hours teaching me balancing equations over discord. When my grandmother got sick, he stayed up until 3:00am just listening to me cry. You can always reach me here, he promised. I don't care what time it is. Mom almost caught us once when she walked by while discord was open. I clicked to my game lobby just in time. Homework break? She asked. I nodded and switched back to my essay, my heart pounding so hard I thought she'd hear it. After she left, Greg's messaged. Maybe we should stop. I don't want to get you in trouble, but I couldn't lose him again. He was the only person who I could rely on. And thank god I didn't lose him, because a couple of days later, my friend Sarah and I got caught up in some shady business. It was supposed to be a normal Saturday night sleepover. Her parents went out for their anniversary, leaving us to watch movies and eat junk food. I was on the phone messaging reggis on discord when Sarah's older brother Josh came Home from college, completely wasted with two other friends, Sarah immediately tensed up. Oh, hi, baby sis and baby girl. He winked disgust singly. He and his friends sat beside us on the sofa, placing his arm over my shoulder, constantly whispering things like, I know you're not as innocent as you act, and your parents don't have to know. I pushed his face away and stood up, glaring. Can you stop? Sarah was almost crying, begging me not to make him mad. He gets mean when he's drunk, she whispered. Just ignore him and he'll pass out soon. But when Joshua grabbed my waist and tried to pull me onto his lap, I grabbed Sarah's arm and ran to the bathroom. Quickly locking the door, he started pounding on it, laughing with his friends about how I was playing hard to get and needed to loosen up. Sarah hopped into the tub, hugging her knees to her chest. I patted my pockets, realizing I had left my phone in the living room. Soon the knocks on the door became angrier. Hitting the door harder, jiggling the handle aggressively, Sarah meekly handed me her phone. I'm so sorry. I had no idea he'd be home. She tried calling her parents, but they didn't pick up, and I didn't have my own parents number.

We got a big table. Everyone started ordering appetizers, entrees, desserts, the works. One friend, Tiffany, ordered an eighty five dollar bottle of wine for herself. Within an hour, the Bill was at six hundred dollars and climbing. Her friends were treating this like their personal party, ordering rounds of 18 hour cocktails like water. I pulled Kendra aside. Hey, what's the deal? This. This is getting expensive. She laughed. Don't worry about it. Who's paying for all this? That's when she dropped it loud enough for everyone to hear. Obviously you are. If you can't pay for all my friends drinks, you're not a real man. That's basic boyfriend stuff. The whole table went quiet. Tiffany smirked and said, yeah, my boyfriend always covers everyone when we go out. I looked at Kendra. She was dead. Serious? Good to know, I said. I stood up, walked to the bar and closed out my tab. Just what I'd ordered. Two beers, $24 with tip. Paid it. What are you doing? Kendra asked. Fused being real with myself, I said. Then I walked out. My phone started blowing up before I reached my car. I didn't answer. Just drove home. Ten minutes later, Kendra sent a frantic voice message. She was screaming. The moment I left, her friends suddenly remembered they had other places to be. Every single one vanished, leaving her with an 800+ Bill that was still growing because they'd ordered more drinks right before I left. The best part? She didn't have her credit card. She'd left it at home because, quote from her text, I knew you'd be paying like a real man should. She had to call her roommate to bring her card. At ten PM on a Friday. Saturday morning, I woke up to 52 missed calls. Not just from Kendra, but from her mom. Her mom left a voicemail. You abandoned my daughter at a restaurant with a Bill she couldn't pay. You need to Venmo her $863 47 and right now and apologize. 863 fourty 7 sub 7. They calculated it down to the penny. Then Kendra texted from her roommate's phone. I had to use my rent money to pay that Bill. You need to pay me back. This is literally theft. I'm giving you one chance. 863 o 47+ $200 for emotional distress. Emotional distress? She wanted damages because I wouldn't pay for her friends drinks. Sunday afternoon she showed up at my apartment with her roommate and some guy trying to look intimidating. They were banging on my door. I watched through my ring camera as

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently in just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key. Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's Pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favourite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly. This whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me. He picked Up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear. From rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialled a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine, it's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed months ago? File everything tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my daughter. I hit another number. Dad, it's happening. Can you come get us? Bring the truck. Caroline, you can't just take her! Jonathan jumped up from the couch. I smiled.

I was only 4 and remember sitting there crying while my mom covered my ears. We couldn't see what was going on because the window was covered in snow, but soon saw the police lights reflecting off of it. I was really scared because my dad wasn't coming back down. But a few minutes later, he walked back downstairs with Santa Claus. My sister and I instantly forgot all, all about the shouting and got really excited. He told us not to worry and that his sleigh had crashed into the snow outside. The shouting were just kind police officers that were helping him dig it out of the snow. He brought us presents to open and sang Christmas songs until the sirens were gone. he said he had to go back to delivering presents for the other kids. I went to sleep that night thinking I was The luckiest kid ever. But it wasn't until I was 17 that I Learned what really happened. Gang tried to break into the house across the street from mine and a few people died right outside that window. The older man who lived next to us knew we had undoubtedly scared kids and happened to have a Santa costume. He put it on and tried to keep us calm until it was over.

Wish I could help. I say genuinely meaning it. I liked the Hollowgate team. By 10:45, Marcus, our CEO, is calling me personally. Randy, there's been a misunderstanding. Can you come in? No misunderstanding. I was terminated yesterday effective immediately. Look, maybe Jessica was hasty. We can work this out. Sorry, Marcus, but I can't legally represent the company anymore. I'm not an employee. As a consultant, then name your rate. I'm not available. Which was true. I had a phone interview with Drift Shade limited at two PM, Hollowate's biggest competitor. According to Beth's increasingly frantic texts, the hollowate team gave Jessica exactly 23 minutes to use the technical documentation they'd specifically flown into review. When she couldn't deliver, they politely excuse themselves and said they'd reassess their partnership options. At noon, Jessica calls me directly, voice shaking. Randy, you have to help me. This is sabotage. This is consequences. Jeff, I can report you for withholding company information. What information? I took my personal belongings when you terminated me. All official files remain on your servers. Those notebooks contain proprietary data. Those notebooks contain my personal work. Notebooks purchased with my own money. Check my employment contract. She hung up. Two hours later, my wife forwards me a screenshot from LinkedIn. Jessica had posted about exciting restructuring opportunities, trying to spin the disaster as strategic plan. The comments were brutal. Three former clients asking where I'd gone, two competitors offering condolences. Even our supplier in Germany asking If we were still operational by four PM after a promising interview with Drift Shade, I had my answer to Jessica's sabotage accusation. I hadn't sabotaged anything. I'd please taking my knowledge with me when they showed me the door. Monday morning, I accepted drip shades offer, Senior Director of Client Relations, 35% salary increase, equity options and a signing bonus. Wednesday, Beth texted me, hollowgate canceled their contract. They're switching to Drift Shade. Also, Jessica got fired. Marcus discovered she'd been inflating her performance metrics for months. Thursday, my new phone at Drift Shade rang. Randy, this is Tom Chen from hollowgate. We heard you joined the team. When can we schedule that technical review? Sometimes the best revenge is simply stepping out of the way and letting people destroy themselves.

Growing up, my sister Kayla made everything about her. My birthday parties. She got gifts, too, because I wouldn't exist without her. Every graduation, every achievement hijacked. When I won the science fair in eighth grade, she convinced my parents to throw her a supportive sister party the same night. When I got into college, she announced her engagement at my Celebration dinner. When I graduated with honors, she showed up in a revealing red dress and spent the whole ceremony flirting with professors. The pattern never stopped. Kayla had this way of making herself the victim whenever I achieved anything. You're so lucky, she'd say. I sacrificed so much for you growing up. Meanwhile, I was the one babysitting her kids while she partied through her 20s. I was the one lending her money she never paid back. I was the one covering for her when she bailed on family obligations. When I got engaged to my Indian fiance. Yeah. I was terrified Kayla would find a way to ruin it. Sure enough, at our engagement party, she immediately joked about wearing white to our wedding. It'll be so funny. She laughed. Like in the movies. I'll be the mysterious woman in white. She even made this dramatic pose, hand on her forehead like some soap opera actress. I pulled her aside and told her, absolutely not. This is my one day. Kayla, please. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic, that it was just a joke. God, you're so sensitive. It's not like anyone would actually confuse me for the bride. But she seemed to agree to drop it. Two weeks later, I found out she'd gone behind my back and asked. Yeah, directly. Your sister seems really excited about her dress choice. Priya mentioned casually over dinner. She kept asking about fabric and styles. My blood ran cold. I knew exactly what that meant. I freaked out on Priya explaining Kayla's entire history of stealing my moments. She did this at my high school graduation. Wore this attention grabbing red dress, and flirted with all the dads. At my college graduation, she announced her pregnancy. She'll definitely show up in some elaborate white gown designed to make everyone look at her instead of us. That night, I had a complete breakdown. Sobbing, hyperventilating. 28 years of suppressed resentment came pouring out. I was convinced Priya would see my toxic family dynamics and run for the hills. Who wants to marry into that kind of drama? Instead, she held me and said something. Gene

They wrote, we cannot be associated with this type of insensitivity. Campaign terminated, $12,000 gone, just like that. The next morning, Chloe Facetime me. Her face was tanned, hair braided with beads, but her tone was frantic. You ruined everything. That was my biggest deal yet. I just looked at her and said quietly, you laughed at me when I needed help getting home from surgery. What did you expect? Her mouth opened, then closed. Finally, she whispered, I didn't think you'd actually do it alone. Exactly. Mom showed up at my door later that week, eyes red, clutching her purse like a shield. I didn't know, she said softly. Yes, you did, I replied. She broke down crying right there on the mat. But I didn't comfort her. I was done being the family's backup plan. And now, weeks later, Chloe's sponsorships have dried up. Her Instagram is dark and Me? I'm healing from surgery and from years of being the invisible one, because here's the truth, sometimes family isn't who shares your blood, it's who shows up when you're weak and can't even drive yourself home. And they didn't. So I closed the group chat, archived it, and whispered to myself, my mistake, but never again.

I've never been pregnant. But I'm starting to believe them. Six months ago, my neighbor knocked on my door holding tiny pink shoes with glittered toes and sequin flowers for your little one, she said, beaming. I thanked her and threw them in my bedroom closet with all the other baby stuff people kept giving me. The thing is, I don't have a baby. I've never been pregnant, never given birth, never even had a serious boyfriend. It started when the grocery store clerk asked how my Newborn was adjusting to formula. I thought he had me confused with someone else, but I was too polite to correct him. the mailman asked if the little angel was sleeping through the night. My landlord reduced my rent because babies are expensive. Everyone in my small Connecticut town suddenly believed I had a daughter. At first, I played along because it was easier than arguing. When neighbors asked about her, I'd smile and say she was doing great. But then things got strange. I came home from work and found formula in my cabinets that I never bought. Baby clothes appeared in my laundry that I never washed. A crib showed up in my bedroom while I was at the grocery store, already assembled by the window. Three weeks in, a woman at the coffee shop asked about our playdate. Our daughters had such fun yesterday. She showing me a photo on her Phone your. Holly looks precious in that blue dress. I stared at the picture. It showed only her baby, a chubby infant in a red shirt. No second child. But she kept pointing an empty space beside her son, describing my daughter's bright blue eyes. That night I called my mom for the first time in months. How are you and my grandbaby, she asked before I could even say hello, mom, I don't have a baby, I said. She got quiet, then angry. Don't play games, Pearl. I know I haven't visited yet, but denying Holly exists is cruel. The thing is, I never told anyone that name, but Holly was always what I planned to name a daughter someday. After Holly go lightly from my face book, I went to my bedroom and froze. The crib I shoved in the closet was back by the window, perfectly positioned. A changing table sat beside it. I know I didn't set them up, but there was a bruise on my shin from where I hit the table leg. I remember doing it, but I so remember the furniture wasn't there five minutes ago. The next morning, I found myself making a bottle without thinking. I caught myself halfway through warming it and threw it in the sink. What the hell was I doing? I looked in the crib and saw a stuffed elephant. I picked it up and for a second I could swear it smelled like baby powder and Milk like Holly, but I don't have a Holly. I started finding evidence everywhere. My phone had alarm set for Holly feeding at 2:00am and 6:00am. My credit card showed purchases at Baby Gap that I couldn't remember making. My neighbor mentioned hearing the baby crying at night, but my apartment was silent. Or was it? Sometimes I wake up exhausted like I've been up all night but couldn't remember why. Yesterday was when everything shifted. I was at the coffee shop exhausted again and the barista asked if the baby kept me up. I don't have a baby, I said firmly. The entire shop went quiet. Everyone stared at me like I'd said something horrible. A woman rushed over and whispered, postpartum depression is serious. Where's Holly right now? There is no holly, I shouted. But even as I said it, I felt wrong, like I was lying. A man ran in from the parking lot. Lady, you left your baby in the car. I sprinted outside and ripped open my back door. Empty. No car seat, no baby, nothing. But I could have sworn I heard crying. I drove home in a panic and searched my apartment. The crib had a pink blanket I never seen before. The changing table had fresh diaper. My phone had 42 photos of empty rooms that were labeled Holly's first smile, Holly sleeping, Holly's First Bath. In every photo I saw nothing but empty spaces. I remembered taking them. I remembered her Weight in my arms last night, I decided to stay awake and watch. At 2:00am, I heard crying from the nursery. Not the bedroom, the nursery. When did my bedroom become a nursery? I walked in and saw the crib rocking slightly. The mobile above it was spinning. The crying.

I thought staying out late was about personal freedom. That's different. Poker is basically gambling and wine bars isn't basically drinking. Friday came. I kissed her goodbye at seven PM don't wait up. These games run really late. What if I need you for something? Like what? You manage fine when you're out until 3:00am. The poker game was actually fun. Around ten PM, my phone started buzzing. Sarah, how's it going? Winning anything? I waited 30 minutes, down 20, but having fun. Eleven PM, what time do you think you'll wrap up? Eleven forty five PM it's getting pretty late for a work now.

The room went quiet. Sarah laughed nervously. Why would we need to? Because I already took one six months ago, I said, pulling out my phone. And according to 23 and me, I have a half sister named Jessica. Been looking for her biological family. I showed them Jessica's profile. Same last name as Mom's Maiden name.

Mom's face went white. Dad stopped laughing immediately. Oh, it gets better. I continued scrolling through my phone. Jessica wasn't the only surprise. I have three half siblings from Mom's various work conferences. I showed them photos. This is Michael from Denver, born in 1998. Ring any bells about that marketing seminar you attended? Alone. Sarah grabbed the phone. That's not possible. And here's little Emma from Portland. Born in 2,001. Funny how she has the same rare eye condition as Mom. Dad's face was turning red, but not from laughter anymore. Linda, what the hell is this? The best part? I pulled out a thick envelope from my jacket. I've been in contact with all three of them for months. They all want to meet their biological mother. In fact, they're driving here right now. Mom stood up shakily. You didn't. I did. Jessica should be here in about an hour. Michael's flying in from Denver tonight. Emma's parents are bringing her tomorrow morning for Christmas brunch. I looked at Sarah, who was still holding the DNA kit. So. Oh, tell me again about not being part of this family. Because it looks like you're about to have a lot more family than you bargained for. Dad was staring at mom like he'd never seen her before. 26 years, Linda. 26 years of marriage, and you've been lying about three children. Actually, I said checking my messages

My son had just gotten his driver's license and we just bought him his first car for his 16th birthday. I was so proud and waved to him as I watched him drive off. That morning, I remember finally getting some alone time when my wife called me. I answered it and heard her crying and dreaming, but I couldn't understand anything she was saying. She told me just to get in my car and start driving because there was an accident on the way to school. The police called her and told her someone ran a red light and hit him. Remember driving there thinking she was overreacting and he'd be okay. But when I saw his car completely crushed, I couldn't breathe. I watched them pull him out and I couldn't even look. We ended up waiting at the hospital for 10 hours and they were the longest of my life. Eventually, when the doctor finally came out to see us, he told us our son was alive. He was breathing, but he wasn't awake. He was in a coma and they weren't sure when he'd wake up. So we sat with him for a few days. We played his favourite music and talked to him. And I like to think he could hear us. Then we got the worst news ever. He had severe brain damage and that he'd never wake up. We decided to turn off his life support. And said goodbye forever. However, a year later, the craziest thing happened. We got a card in the mail thanking us and thanking our son. We had no idea, but they actually used my son's heart to save this guy's life. We agreed for him to be an organ donor. And a month later, we met the guy and got the best gift we've ever received. We got to listen to our son's heartbeat one more time.

I'd been the family disappointment for 23 years, while my perfect older brother, Kyle got everything handed to him. When Grandpa died and left me his house in his will, dad absolutely lost it. There's no way that senile old man left you anything, he snarled, pacing around our kitchen like a king aged animal. You're probably not even my real son anyway. Your mother was sleeping around before we got married. My brother Kyle smirked from the corner. Yeah, remember how wild mom was back in college? Dad's got a point. My stepmother Linda chimed in with that fake sweet voice she always used. Honey, we just want what's fair for the real family. You understand, right? They gave me 48 hours to take a paternity test or they challenge the will in court. The whole extended family was already texting about it in the group chat, calling me a fraud and a bastard. Here's what none of them knew. I've been secretly taking care of Grandpa for the past two years while they all ignored him. Every single doctor's appointment when his arthritis got bad, every grocery run when he couldn't drive anymore. Every lonely evening when he just wanted someone to talk to about grandma. I also knew about the second will he'd written just three months before he died. The next morning, dad changed the locks on Grandpa's house. When I showed up with my key. I couldn't get in. My stuff was piled on the front lawn in garbage bags. You're trespassing! Dad yelled from the window. This is family property until you prove you belong here. I called the police. Within an hour, Officer Ortiz was standing in the driveway reading the will. Sir, according to this legal document, your son owns this property. You're the one trespassing. Dad's face went red as they made him give me the new keys. The neighbors were all watching from their windows. Test day arrived at the family lawyer's office. The whole crew showed up like it was some kind of Celebration. Dad wore his best suit and kept checking his Rolex, probably already planning how to spend what he thought would be his inheritance money. Kyle brought his new girlfriend to show off. You're about to see how we handle fake family members, he told her loudly. Linda kept taking selfies, probably planning to post about their victory later. Uncle Robert and Aunt Deborah drove in from two states away just to witness my humiliation. The family group chat had been buzzing for days about this showdown.

She can keep them for her Victorian cosplay group. I'll send them some tea biscuits. This isn't funny. Can't you just compromise? Let's do Agatha as her first name and something modern as the middle name. Compromise? Sure. Aila as her first name, Agatha as the middle. They're solved. That's not compromise. That's just you winning. And naming her Agatha isn't you winning? What's next? You naming our future dog Horace Jr? You're impossible. Fine. Let's talk about this more later. But no Moonbeam, okay? Ever. Deal. But only if you admit that horse and Agatha sound like a haunted couple in a Scooby Doo episode. Fine. But you're still not off the hook. Bring it on, horse.

My five year old daughter's neighbor. Carlos was a 19 year old who worked three jobs to support his younger siblings. Every morning, he'd wave to Lily on his way to work, and she'd run to the fence to show him her drawings. Lily called him her best grown up friend. One Saturday morning, police cars surrounded Carlos's house. There had been a break in six blocks away, and someone gave them Carlos's name as a suspect. The elderly victim, Mrs. Patterson, was in intensive care, fighting for her life after being brutally attacked during the robbery. The evidence seemed overwhelming. Carlos match the description. Young Hispanic male, about six feet tall. He'd been doing odd jobs in that neighborhood. Most damning, they found Mrs. Patterson's stolen jewelry in his work truck. Though Carlos swore someone planted it there. Carlos was arrested and charged with aggravated robbery and attempted murder. His family couldn't afford a good lawyer. The prosecution painted him as a dangerous criminal targeting vulnerable elderly victims. He. I was looking at 25 years to life for a crime I was certain he didn't commit. I knew Carlos was innocent. I'd seen him that Saturday morning working in our shared garden. But the timeline was tight. That's when I remembered. Lily had been playing in our backyard that entire morning, chattering non stop to Carlos while he worked. She'd been helping him plant tomatoes and asking him a Million questions called Carlos's lawyer about Lily's potential testimony. He was skeptical. Child witnesses are unreliable. But I insisted we try. We spent hours preparing Lily, explaining she needed to tell the truth about that Saturday morning when Carlos was planting vegetables. The prosecution had presented their case with confidence, DNA evidence, witness descriptions, and stolen jewelry. When the defense called Lily to the stand, the courtroom went silent. As this tiny girl walked up to the witness box, the judge adjusted the microphone down to her level. Lily, the lawyer began gently, do you remember Saturday morning when Carlos was working in your garden? She nodded seriously. We were planting the tomato babies. She said clearly. Carlos was very careful with them because baby plants can die if you're not gentle. What else do you remember? She brightened. Carlos taught me about bugs, and he showed me how his hands were all dirty from the special plant food. And he said he couldn't touch anything clean until we wash them. The lawyer asked, did Carlos wash his hands that morning? Oh, yes, she I said proudly. We washed them together at the garden faucet with the special soap. Carlos said dirty hands make everything dirty, so we scrubbed until they were super clean. But then Lily added something that changed everything. And Carlos was very sad about his work gloves. The lawyer asked her to explain.

This mom is adjusting to her new normal after losing her hands and legs because of all things, a dog lick. Marie Trainer woke up from a 10 day coma to find her limbs had been amputated. She cried the hardest I ever cried in my life. The life changing tragedy had its origins during a vacation in the Caribbean with her husband. Marie says she was using her key card to access her hotel when she accidentally nicked herself on her wrist. It was a tiny little scratch, a silly accident. It hardly hurt. When Marie came home, her dog Taylor greeted her with lots of kisses. But the dog also licked Marie's scratch. Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders. It turns out that her dog's saliva carried a bacteria called capnocytophaga. It's quite common in dogs, but what happened to Marie is a very rare occurrence. Her husband Matthew is doing his best to lift her spirits. I love her to death. She's everything to me.

He pulled out several hundred dollar bills and handed them to the cashier, and he actually used the counterfeit pens on them, which worked. Um, once he did that, it appeared that another male that was with them, possibly a lookout, um, he signaled to another girl that was with them to, you know, hey, come up here and do your transaction. That woman and used another several hundred dollar bills to buy a visa gift card. A counterfeit pen also showed that the bills were real. All three walked out of the store and nobody realized anything was wrong. And later on, when they were counting the cash in there using a actual cash counter, those bills were all flagged, um, as counterfeit. Detective Nate Lean with the Danville Police Department said the trio scammed the store out of $800 Teen Kroger stores in Indiana, mostly in the Indianapolis area, and has cost the supermarket chain nearly $12,000. In all 14 cases, $100, uh, counterfeit bills were used. Um, they're using them to buy the Green Dot cards, the visa gift cards and what not.

I can't live like this. This mom is adjusting to her new normal after losing her hands and legs because of all things, a dog Lick. Marie Trainer woke up from a 10 day coma to find her limbs had been amputated. She cried the hardest I ever cried in my life. The life changing tragedy had its origins during a vacation in the Caribbean with her husband. Marie says she was using her key card to access her hotel when she accidentally nicked herself on her wrist. It was a tiny little scratch, a silly accident. It hardly hurt. When Marie came home, her dog Taylor greeted her with lots of kisses. But the dog also licked Marie's scratch. Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders. It turns out that her dog's saliva carried a bacteria called capnocytophaga. It's quite common in dogs, but what happened to Marie is a very rare occurrence. Her husband Matthew is doing his best to lift her spirits. I love her to death. She's everything to me.

He pulled out several hundred dollar bills and handed them to the cashier, and he actually used the counterfeit pens on them, which worked. Um, once he did that, it appeared that another male that was with them, possibly a lookout, um, he signaled to another girl that was with them to, you know, hey, come up here and do your transaction. That woman and used another several hundred dollar bills to buy a visa gift card. A counterfeit pen also showed that the bills were real. All three walked out of the store and nobody realized anything was wrong. And later on, when they were counting the cash in there using a actual cash counter, those bills were all flagged, um, as counterfeit. Detective Nate Lean with the Danville Police Department said the trio scammed the store out of $800 Teen Kroger stores in Indiana, mostly in the Indianapolis area, and has cost the supermarket chain nearly $12,000. In all 14 cases, $100, uh, counterfeit bills were used. Um, they're using them to buy the Green Dot cards, the visa gift cards and what not. And as long as they can get them to pass, that money now turns into legitimate money because it's now on a gift card.

Sarah McKinley, a young mother, noticed a group of suspicious men loitering around her house, one of whom was holding a crowbar. She recognized that one of them was the person who had been following her recently. Her husband passed away on Christmas Day, leaving only her and her three month old child at home, which made Sarah more and more anxious. She called 9 1 1 for help, but just as she was calling the dispatcher, those men began to try to force their way through the front door. Worried about her and the child's life safety, Sarah picked up her weapon and loaded it. She kept asking the 9 1 1 operator if she was allowed to protect herself with a weapon. The dispatcher comforted her calmly, saying that she had the right to do everything possible to protect her child. When one of the intruders finally broke in, Sarah immediately pulled the trigger and K I L L. Him. The others were panicked and fled the scene after seeing their companions fall. Sarah remained highly vigilant, holding the child in one hand and a weapon in the other until the police arrived.

A haunting viral video shows what allegedly appeared like the boy was cowering after being handed a box at a supermarket with many parental experts saying it was not a flinch but seemingly a brace for impact. Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing with many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all. Many to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flipped with even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house and many allege the situation might be much worse than now.

Gregory told us last year when this all came to light that she believed she'd been drugged the night she was arrested. The 22 year old also said Officer Nager left her with bald spots from the forced removal of the hair weave. This kind of behavior is not tolerated at the warm police department. In the case of Gregory's cut off hair weave, arbitrator Nora Lynch issued this 26 page opinion ordering Warren to not only give major her job back, but to give her more than $86,000 in back pay bounded by the taxpayers. But Bernadette Major wanted her job back so her police union appealed her termination through something called binding arbitration. Instead of fighting it out in court for employment matters, an arbitrator can listen to both sides and make a decision. The arbitrator does admit that that cannot be seen in the video and Nature's boss didn't see it either.

Judge Kevin Mullins was shot and killed by the town sheriff in front of the camera in his office. He once turned the prison in Lectola County into a brothel to satisfy his and his nauseating friends filthy fantasies. Bollins and his friends organized such parties in the county prison and other buildings in town, selecting the female prisoners they wanted. As a reward for these women, he will shorten their sentences or alleviate any punishment they face. If these women are unwilling to participate or refuse, he will threaten them, either sentencing them to the maximum sentence or kicking them to their most painful place. On March 12th, Sheriff Marshall was invited to a party and discovered that his wife and daughter were also involved. His wife was beaten by Mullen's for disobedience and Sheriff Marshall angrily questioned Mullen's before taking his wife and daughter home. Two days later, his daughter ended her life due to her inability to accept reality. Furious, Marshall rushed into Mullins's office, pulled out his weapon and fired three shots in a row. He died before the police arrived. Now Marshall is accused of first degree murder. He may never see his family again. Do you think he is a hero or a criminal?

And you're telling me this because? Might not make it home. Whatever. Wait, what do you mean? Aren't you gonna ask what I'm up to? Why I'm not coming home? What's there to ask? You're out drinking with the boys, right? Staying at a buddy's place if it gets late. You're so smart. Babe, we've got a work dinner thing tonight. I know. Don't wait up for me, okay? No need to leave the door unlocked. Got it. Babe, can I ask you something? You're so chill about this. Aren't you worried I might do something I shouldn't? If that's what you wanna do, could I stop you? Anyway, it's your call. You've changed so much. Feel like I barely know you lately. The old you would have made me come home no matter how late. Can I ask you something, too? Did the old me annoy you? If we're both gonna be miserable, might as well let you have your fun. Babe, I love you. Don't worry. I won't nag you to come home anymore. No more overthinking, either. If you drink too much, crash at your buddies. I get it now. No more micromanaging you or fighting over little things. Babe, I'm touched you feel this way. I'll love you more and more. Hmm. Have a good time with your friends. Hey. We'll do. Babe. Just got off work. You didn't forget what day it is, right? It's my birthday. Going out with Co workers. Wanna join? I'll pass. Don't know your work friends would be awkward. Happy birthday. Thanks, babe. Love you. You sure you won't come? I'm sure. Alright. Did you get me a birthday gift? Nope. You always used to plan ahead. Why nothing for my birthday this year? You never liked the gifts I got before, right? Figured cash would be better. Money is what matters anyway. Better to focus on making more dollar than stressing over gifts. You've grown up. I knew you were the best. I'll be home early tonight, babe. Heading home now. I had a bit too much feeling dizzy. I'm home. Babe. You're not here. Where'd you go? Still at work. Overtime, tons to do. Deadline tomorrow. Go to bed. I'll be back when I'm done. Babe, my head's killing me. Okay, noted. Did you hear me? My head hurts. Can't talk. Busy. We'll discuss when I'm back. Changed? You don't care about me at all anymore. So cold and distant. Nothing like when we first met. I go out now. No calls, no texts. Let me ask you. Isn't this what you wanted? Not prying, giving you space. This is what you told me before. I'm doing it now. Isn't that enough? What more do you want? Why are you unhappy now? You've got it all wrong, babe. This isn't what I wanted. I want you to be your old self again. The girl who only had eyes for me. Back to how We were when we first fell in love. It's too late. We can't go back. I'm numb now. I see things clearly. Let the past be the past. There's something I've wanted to tell you for a while.

Despu√©s, me inscribi√≥ en un concurso de belleza. En la primera Ronda, el reto era comer hamburguesas. La competidora, frente a m√≠, ajust√≥ su cintur√≥n antes de agarrar la primera hamburguesa. Pero con mi marido como mi superpoder, no estaba nada preocupada. Tom√© la hamburguesa y empec√© a devorarla con estilo. En poco tiempo, limpi√© todas las hamburguesas de la mesa. Lo m√°s incre√≠ble es que no solo no engord√©, sino que incluso perd√≠ un kilo. Mi rival no tuvo la misma suerte, comi√≥ tanto que engord√≥ y su cintur√≥n se rompi√≥. As√≠, gan√© la primera Ronda con facilidad. En la segunda Ronda, el reto era saltar barras. Con la ayuda de mi marido, pas√© la primera barra sin problemas, pero para otra competidora eso tampoco era un desaf√≠o. La segunda barra, del tama√±o de una hoja 4, la hizo dudar. Se quit√≥ algunos accesorios y logr√≥ pasar. Yo, como siempre, no me preocup√©, pero no esperaba que la aspiradora de mi marido fuera tan d√©bil. Intent√© pasar la barra con esfuerzo, pero no pude sin opciones. Mi marido apret√≥ los dientes, subi√≥ la potencia de la aspiradora y absorbi√≥ la mitad de mi peso. As√≠ pas√© con facilidad. Luego puso la aspiradora al m√°ximo, casi convirti√©ndome en un rayo de delgadez. Gracias a eso, pas√© la tercera barra sin esfuerzo. Mi competidora estaba t√≥nica, pero ella tambi√©n ten√≠a sus ideas locas. Se meti√≥ en una Bolsa de vac√≠o sac√≥ todo el aire y logr√≥ pasar la tercera barra con ese m√©todo. Mi marido, viendo un oponente tan fuerte, estaba furioso. La Ronda final consist√≠a en atravesar rayos infrarrojos en la entrada de un banco para conseguir el premio en efectivo. El problema era que el pasaje ten√≠a solo 30cm de ancho, imposible para una persona normal. Pero mi rival, con un m√©todo extremadamente directo, logr√≥ pasar. Mi marido con los ojos rojos de rabia, us√≥ la aspiradora para succionarme directamente a trav√©s del pasaje. Ese superpoder era realmente impresionante. Corr√≠ a tomar el premio, pero al alejarme de la aspiradora volv√≠ a ser la mujer gorda de 100 kilos. Mi marido me pidi√≥ que le entregara el premio, pero aunque soy gorda, no soy tonta, as√≠ que me negu√© furioso. Intent√≥ tomar el dinero por la fuerza, pero antes de tocarlo fue exposado. La competidora en realidad era una polic√≠a encubierta. Marido fue arrestado por obligarme ilegalmente a participar en el concurso y termin√≥ siendo llevado a la c√°rcel. A reflexionar en ese momento, un volante vol√≥ hacia mi cara. Dec√≠a, las chicas grandes tambi√©n tienen su propia belleza

He treated himself like a relay baton, passing himself between horses. As soon as the little horse got the postman, it switch to high gear. Speed instantly shot up to 370 and even steep, dangerous cliffs felt like flat ground. As the ace of the postal world, the man's goal was always to deliver the letter as fast as possible. But there was one thing that limited his speed, the stamina of the horse under him. So whenever the horse started slowing down, he would contact the post office ahead of him to prepare a new horse. When they heard the ace postman was on his way, a rookie horse immediately volunteered. Though inexperienced, he had a passion for the Postal Service. Seeing the little horse so eager, the boss couldn't wait to approve him. After a few friendly words of advice, the little horse, full of energy, went to the roadside, warming up and getting into the zone. Now starting the ninth set of calisthenics. March in place. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Stop! At that moment, the postman's old horse, eager to clock out, saw the little horse and quickly handed the man over like a baton. The little horse grabbed him and pressed him against his back, activating turbo mode and shooting off. Experienced old horses watching this couldn't Help but smirk. The little horse, fresh to the job, was fearless and reckless, speeding insanely fast. But he was distracted, not watching the road, and both he and the postman plunged off a cliff. Luckily, a pond below softened their fall. More fortunately, they had two and a half years of breath holding training. But the bad luck didn't stop there. Just as they resurfaced, they fell into an even deeper pool. As bubbles floated to the surface, the postman's greeting to the little horse was definitely full of gold. The little horse, thoroughly dejected, lay motionless. The engine waterlogged, but the postman had a few slick tricks up his sleeve. Fully revived, the little horse was back on his hooves, running like a beast. Until a sudden emergency break flung the postman off the cliff. He slid for five or six hundred meters before realizing something was wrong. But he stayed calm, performed an emergency stop, and spun around, riding the air back toward the little horse. One had to wonder if he and Newton shared some sort of mysterious connection. But just when things seemed to settle, the postman found himself in trouble again. The infamous bandit Jiang Yang was now on his tail. Rumor had it this Bandit could make even the mighty Nezza leave behind three pounds of lotus powder. Before robbing anyone, he had to apply sunscreen. He was a beauty fanatic, after all. Despite his small stature of only half a meter, his Horse under him was no slouch. The height of two and a half meters, he looked down on every preschooler. The postman sensed danger and quickly turned. He saw the bandit closing in fast, so he slammed the brakes, using the little horse's cover to prepare for a one on one showdown. But the little horse, realising something was off, bolted behind the postman. No matter what the man commanded, he just wouldn't listen. After all, he was just a horse. The man gave up trying to order him around and decided to use reason. Fists are the real answer. A saying that proved true. But before he could fight back, he locked eyes with the bandit, awkwardly smiling and politely nodding. Then he turned and ran. The little horse, now fully awake, followed closely. To their surprise, they reached a perfect synchronization, racing together powerfully, shaking off the bandit and charging into the final station. The Bandit, now headed straight for the iron gate, slammed on the brakes in panic, throwing out a two room apartment in the process. Finally, the postman delivered the letter. But just as he did, he was stunned to see a little elf pop out of the bag.

He wrote that I rob banks and hide the money under the floorboards. I was helping my eight year old Rowan with his backpack when I found his. My parents job worksheets stuff. Between his math homework and a crumpled juice box. In his messy second grade handwriting, he'd written, my daddy robs banks everyday, brings home lots of money and puts it under our kitchen floor. Sometimes he counts it at night when Mommy's sleeping and they whisper about numbers. At first I laughed it off. Kids say the weirdest things, right? I work as an armored truck driver for Brink Security. Technically, I do go to banks every day and handle massive amounts of cash. probably just got confused about what daddy actually does for work. But then his teacher called Tuesday morning. Mr Whitaker, we need to talk about Rowan's assignment. He's been telling his classmates some very detailed stories about your financial activities. Yesterday during show and tell, he described exactly how you open bank vaults and mentioned specific dollar amounts. Stomach dropped. Missus Aldridge, I drive an armored truck. I transport money legally. Rowan must be misunderstanding what he sees. He also drew a picture of your house with an X marking where the money is hidden. The other children are asking their parents why their dads don't bring home bank money, too. I left work early, my mind racing. How could Rowan know specific details about bank procedure?

I was on Facetime at 1:00am with my girlfriend when my mom burst through my door without knocking, finding me mid laugh with Nadine on my phone screen. Are you serious right now? Mom shrieked, grabbing my phone while Nadine's confused face disappeared into darkness. This is completely inappropriate. It's a school night. Dad appeared behind her, shaking his head like I committed some federal crime. They didn't care that I had straight A's, that this was my chance with my crush, or that these late night calls were the only thing keeping her interested in me. You're 16. You don't need to be talking to girls at all hours. It was insane. Complete device lockdown after 9 p m. Phone physically placed in their bedroom every night. Wi-Fi router programmed to kill my connection. Even my laptop taken away just in case. Mom installed one of those parental control apps that sent her alerts if I even touched any device after curfew. Healthy boundaries, she kept saying, showing me some article about teenage sleep schedule she'd found on Facebook. That first night without talking to Nadine was torture. I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, wondering if she thought I was ignoring her, if she was upset, if she think I didn't care anymore. My parents did three separate checks that night, opening my door to make sure I was in bed, sleep device less, and alone. The second night, I Couldn't handle it. Nadine had texted me 17 times during school asking if I was okay if we were breaking up. Then I got an idea. I remembered my iPhone 6 buried in my closet. Cracked screen, terrible battery. But it could work. After my parents 9:30 p m. Check, I waited until 10:15 to be safe, then pulled out the hidden phone. Nadine's face appeared, pixelated and laggy, but she was smiling. I thought your parents murdered you, she whispered, and I had to bite my tongue to keep from laughing. We developed an intricate system based on my parents patterns. Mom always did checks throughout the night. I became a master of deception. The moment I heard her footsteps on the stairs. I'd whisper, she's coming to Nadine, kill the screen, slide the phone under my pillow, close my eyes, and control every micro expression on my face. The hardest part was when mom would just stand there staring, and I'd have to remain completely stone faced, breathing steady and deep, like I was truly asleep. Once mom actually walked over and stood directly over me for a full minute. It was torture. Then, weirdly, Nadine asked me, babe, are you okay? You keep coughing. I hadn't even noticed I was doing it, but she was right. My throat felt scratchy and weird. Maybe you're getting sick, she suggested. But. And I smelled it. Something sharp and chemical cutting through my room. Hold on, I whispered. And when I opened my bedroom door. My stomach dropped. Gray smoke was flowing along the hallway ceiling like a river, getting thicker by the second, pouring from the direct

Wait until they see what a year in China taught me. I start seventh grade with a renewed boost of confidence after spending a year with my grandparents in China. Walking into the school, I spot my worst nightmare. I knew this moment would come eventually. There's Shane, still the same 5 feet 8 inches tower of teenage cruelty, flanked by his usual suspects, Minion 1 and Minion 2. Such loyal followers. I'm still only 5 feet 2 inches and probably look exactly the same to them. Same. See? Brown hair, same hand me down clothes, same kid they used to stuff into lockers every Tuesday. Like clockwork. Well, well, well, look who's back, Shane announces loud enough for half the hallway to hear. We missed our little toilet bowl cleaner. Minion one actually claps his hands together like he's genuinely excited. Dude, remember when we made him eat that sandwich off the bathroom floor? They're laughing about it like it's their fondest memory. And I feel that familiar burning in my chest. Except this time it feels different. Controlled. My grandfather's voice echoes in my head. Anger is fire. You can let it burn you, or you can forge steel with it. Minion two steps closer, invading my personal space. Hope you didn't get too comfortable wherever you went, because nothing's changed here. He shoves my shoulder, testing to see if I'll react the same way I used to. Cowering and apologizing instead, I steady myself and look him directly in the eye. Everything's changed, I say quietly, but Minion 2 just laughs and walks away with his friends. Same scared little mouse. Shane calls over his shoulder. See you in P E. Bathroom, boy. P E. Class arrives like a death sentence, and of course coach pairs us up for defensive exercises, which basically his excuse to let kids beat each other up legally. Shane immediately volunteers to be my partner, grinning like Christmas morning. This is going to be fun! He tells Minion 1 and Minion 2, who are partnered nearby. I've been saving up a year's worth of frustration. He starts small, an accidental elbow to my ribs during warm UPS. Oops! Sorry Mouse Boy, didn't mean to hurt you. When I tell him I'm not weak anymore, he literally doubles over laughing. Not weak? You're the same 70 pound scarecrow who cried when I gave you a wedgie! That's when he crosses the line. During partner exercises, he's supposed to hold the punching pad steady, but instead he keeps jerking it away so my punches miss and I stumble forward. Maybe if you ate some actual food instead of whatever they feed mice. The rage is building in my chest, but I hear Grandpa's training. The river that moves mountains doesn't rage. It flows with purpose. Coach steps away to help another student with their form, and that's when Shane decides to get Creative. Minion 1 comes and hands Shane a bucket, which he dumps over my head. Water splashes down, soaking my clothes. Here you go, mouse boy, you looked a bit thirsty. Minion 1 and Minion 2 are recording with their phones now, probably planning to post it on social media. I'm dripping wet and Shane gets in my face, but still I hold back. Then he spots my friend Jace across the gym and smiles. Shane's now

My sister Maya had just escaped the worst relationship of her life. She moved in with me and my husband Kyle, bringing her five month old son, Oliver. She was dealing with postpartum depression and regular depression on top of everything else. Kyle said absolutely when I asked if she could stay with us. Actually, he was the one who drove three hours to pick them up. For two weeks, everything seemed fine. Maya helped with dishes and laundry without me even asking. But then Kyle started complaining about Oliver crying at night. I mean, what did he expect from a five month old baby? Suggested he wear earbuds to sleep, but he just grumbled and said, forget it. Last week I had to drive four hours away for my friend Jessica's funeral. Kyle said he'd stay home to keep an eye on Maya and make sure she was okay. I thought that was sweet of him, honestly. When I got back the next day, the house was completely silent. No baby sounds, no Maya humming while she folded clothes like she always did. I called out for them, but got nothing. Kyle came downstairs looking weird, kind of nervous, but trying to act casual. He told me Maya had called some friend in another town and decided to move there. That morning, he handed me this. Crumpled letter that supposedly was from her. The whole thing felt wrong. Maya would have called me or at least texted. We talked every day about everything. I called her phone about 20 times. No answer. Kyle said she must have left it behind because he found it on the kitchen counter. That made zero sense. Maya never went anywhere without her phone, especially with a baby. I started calling our relatives. Our Aunt Carol, our cousin Brett, even our grandma, who Maya called every Sunday. Nobody had heard from her. Nobody even knew she was planning to leave. Kyle kept saying she probably just needed space and would call when she was ready. For six days, I barely slept. Kept thinking about Maya. Alone somewhere with Oliver, dealing with her depression without any support. Kyle got annoyed when I kept bringing it up. He said I was being dramatic and that Maya was a grown woman who could take care of herself. Yesterday, my phone rang from a number I didn't recognize. It was Maya, and she was crying. She told me Kyle had kicked her out the day I left for the funeral. He told her she wasn't welcome anymore and needed to take responsibility for her decisions instead of depending on us. She wasn't staying with some friend. She was at a homeless shelter downtown with Oliver. She had no money, no car, nothing.

Dinner was painfully awkward. It had been two years since mom left, and my dad's girlfriend, Britt, had tried too hard to impress us, making Dinosaur nuggets and smiley face Mac and cheese like we were five. My brother flipped his plate and glared at her. First you try to take dad away, and now you're bribing us with nuggets? He asked coldly. Colton! Dad yelled. Britt smiled. You're right. Next time I'll add spaghetti, she joked. Table fell silent. Dad coughed awkwardly and stood up to take a call. That's when Brit leaned forward and looked at me and my siblings with a serious expression. Look, I know this is weird, she said. What will it take for you guys to actually like me? My older brother leaned forward, too, eyeing her down, and said in his toughest 13 year old voice, do everything we say for one month. Brit didn't even hesitate. Deal. What's first? What she didn't know was that my brother was already prepared to go to war with her. And what we didn't know was that Brit was prepared, too. My brother announced the first impossible challenge. Best us at every video game we own. I knew he'd start here. Colton was undefeated at Fortnite in our entire school, but Brit showed up the next day, having studied YouTube tutorials all night. She destroyed him five rounds straight, then did the floss dance over His defeated character. My little sister innocently cheered, while my brother insisted it didn't count that he was just warming up. Best of 10, he said, and she won eight out of 10. When my brother looked sad, she showed him the trick she Learned. That way you'll destroy everyone else. He winked. The next challenge was pure physical. Old people can't do obstacle courses. My brother grinned, building one in the backyard with everything from tire runs to rope climbs. But when Brit showed up in full Crossfit gear, we knew we were done for. She ended up beating my brother's record by 30 seconds. Now do it backwards! He demanded. She did it backwards. Now blindfolded. I saw my brother mouth what the heck? When she actually did it blindfolded, using only our shouted directions. Honestly, we were impressed. Is that all you got? She teased. This week you have to pick us up from school instead of dad, but you gotta wear embarrassing costumes. And she did. Turns out Brit was a retired cosplayer. She showed up to school in an Optimus Prime costume, then a fully geared up attack on Titan costume, and a bunch more insane outfits. My friends kept saying, your mom's cool, don't you dare smile! My brother hissed at me. I'm not! I protested. I totally was! The endurance challenge was my brother's last stand, an anime Marathon of one piece to see who could stay awake. My sister fell asleep on Brit's shoulder around our six. Colton and I crashed. After 14 hours, Brit paused the show and covered us all with blankets. She carried my sister to bed and took off her shoes. She tucked me in on the couch, whispering

My best friend, Trent, paced around the room nervously. What do I do? I think our roommate is in love with me, he muttered. I bursted into laughter. Gemma? I highly doubt it, I said. Our roommates, Gemma and Ali, definitely hadn't shown they were interested in Trent at all. From what I'd seen, Gemma was naturally friendly and Ali was quiet and closed off. But Trent insisted. He pushed a crumpled piece of paper to my chest, laughing, read it and weep. I scanned through the paper that definitely very clearly stated my dazzling Trent, and I was shocked. He was right. Someone had a huge crush on him. Are you sure it's Gemma? I asked. Trent nodded and explained how there had been obvious signs. He offered me coffee when I came over. He said, that's basically asking me out. I reminded him she offered everyone coffee, but she laughed at all my jokes. Then she asked about my weekend plans. That's basically girl code for checking if I'm single, Or she's just asking about your weekend plans like a normal person, I suggested. Then he pulled out actual evidence, a poem on the kitchen counter with romantic lines like brown eyes sweeter than honey and a laugh that makes Monday mornings bearable. That's totally me, he yelled. I shrugged. I don't see it, I joked. He rolled his eyes. And haven't you noticed every time I visit There's always a gift waiting for me. Yeah, I remember that. A box of his favorite brand of herbal tea that no one else drank showed up on his table the day we were out, along with a bookmark with a quote from a movie he mentioned liking and a stress ball that showed up right before his big job interview. Trent had spent weeks building up the courage to talk to Gemma about it, waiting for that one sure sign that Gemma really felt that way about, about him. Then that sign arrived tonight. Trent had stayed late to help me with a project when we heard singing through the walls. One of the girls had been singing Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me in the most angelic voice. Then we heard it. She actually sang his name, adding Trent right into the lyrics. Trent jumped off the couch like he'd been electrocuted. I told you she likes me, he half whispered. He decided right then he was going to confess his feelings. Thanks, too. The next day he showed up at our apartment with a bouquet of roses and a poem he wrote on his own. Trent nervously walked over to Gemma, who was chilling on the couch watching Netflix. He looked up at the flowers and smiled. Wow, nice flowers. You look great, she said, calm and friendly like always. Trent cleared his throat. I know about the poems and the gifts and the song. Gemma's smile. Turned into confusion. Trent, what is this? What's going on? Gemma stared at Trent for a long moment. Wait, are you talking?

After telling us that she had mandatory district training for three days starting Monday, my English teacher pointed at me and announced, you'll be teaching the Shakespeare unit while I'm gone since you actually understand the material, unlike everyone else who thinks the movie counts as reading. I stared at her in complete disbelief. Shouldn't we have a substitute teacher? Sure, for this? She shuffled papers, avoiding eye contact because she definitely knew this was wrong. Substitutes are incompetent and I don't have time to train someone on my specific curriculum. I pushed back immediately, but I'm not trained either, and I'm literally a student. She was already halfway out the door, clutching her tote bag. Just follow the lesson plan and make them understand Romeo and Juliet, since there's a test when I get back, have a great weekend. Goodbye. She practically ran from the room before I could protest further. And suddenly I understood exactly how badly this would backfire. Monday morning, I walked into class dragging a suitcase full of zombie makeup and fake blood. We're doing Romeo and Juliet Love in the time of zombies where the Montagues are zombie hunters and the Capulet are secretly infected. Jackson volunteered for Romeo and I told him his character collected zombie teeth as trophies. Sophia got Juliet, who was slowly turning but fighting it for love. We rewrote the balcony scene at the quarantine breach. But soft what light or yonder window breaks, it is the east and Juliet hasn't eaten anyone yet. Jackson delivered while Sophia not on her own arm. For practice, the nurse became a scientist and Friar Lawrence ran an underground zombie shelter. By lunch, everyone had memorized more Shakespeare then they had all semester. Tuesday we created hazmat suits from garbage bags for the Montagues and painted decay on the capsules with whiteout and permanent markers. The party scene became Romeo discovering Juliet wasn't quite human when she tried to bite him during their first kiss. She literally tried to eat your face and you're still into her, someone shouted as Mercutio, who believed the government created the virus. Love conquers all, even the undead, Jackson replied, while Sophia perfected her zombie twitch by watching possum videos. The janitor walked in and saw 30 students covered in fake blood, staging what looked like a biohazard event and immediately left, muttering about his paycheck. Wednesday got completely out of control when I invited other classes to watch without permission. The fight scene turned into Mercurio getting infected while Romeo had to decide whether to kill his best friend before he turned. We used pool noodles as weapons and ketchup packets for blood, which exploded everywhere, coating walls and ceiling and red slatter. A plague on both your houses became. I'm literally plagued by both your houses and it's highly contagious. While the infected Mercurio chased students down the hallway, moaning about Government conspiracies and demanding brains. The cafeteria staff locked their doors when they saw him coming and someone pulled the fire alarm thinking there was an actual emergency happening. The principal arrived after getting six emergency calls about a possible biohazard in the English wing. Plus reports that student.

I thought, is this for real? Denise Holland is making her message explicitly clear. If they have to go to the bathroom, let him go to the bathroom. No one should curb her stepson's bathroom breaks. It's preposterous. You think it's a joke? She says his first grade teacher sent this note home with students at C C. Rono Elementary School last week. It asked parents to encourage bladder endurance so kids only have to use the restroom once or twice in a school day. For children, it's normal for them to go up to 10 to 12 times a day. Pediatric urologist Doctor Jessica T. Casey tells me, waiting too long can cause infections, bed wetting, and even long term kidney damage. We can't be there in the classroom with them. So at least when we hear of stuff like this going on, I think it's important that we go to the school right away. It's so important to stand up for the kids cause they don't really have a voice. They gave us a letter from the school's principal now. It reads in part, I want to reassure parents the school has never had a policy restricting bathroom breaks for students. And in my class, the students will be able to go when they ask.

When I was 24, I was basically a walking disaster. I've been rejected from Target, Walmart, even the gas station down the street. I was sleeping in my beat up Honda Civic after losing my apartment and had like $12 to my name. So when I saw this job posting for a receptionist at this fancy law firm downtown, I figured, what the hell, right? The posting said bilingual preferred. And without thinking, I just checked the Spanish box. I took two years of Spanish in high school. How hard could it be? The interview was with this older lady in a sharp suit who looked like she could buy and sell me 10 times over. Everything was going fine until she smiled and said something in Spanish. I panicked and mumbled the only thing I could remember, me, llamo Lila, em gusto LA pizza. She laughed and said, good enough. Our Spanish speaking clients will love having someone who understands their culture. I thought for sure they'd figure it out on day one. But turns out all I had to do was answer their phones and look professional. Most of the Spanish speaking clients brought their own translators anyway. Whenever someone called speaking Spanish, I'd put them on hold and frantically use Google Translate to figure out what they wanted. Un momento por favor became my best friend. This went on for months. I started watching Spanish soap operas at night in my car, trying to pick up phrases. I downloaded Duolingo and did lessons during lunch breaks. I even befriended Rosa at the coffee shop and practiced ordering in Spanish until she got annoyed with me. Then everything went sideways. One of the firm's biggest clients, an old guy named Miguel, who owned half the restaurants in the city, passed away suddenly. His widow only spoke Spanish and was devastated. And somehow, because I was the bilingual guy, they assigned me to be the translator at his funeral. I begged my boss to let someone else do it. This is huge, Elijah. It shows how much we trust you, she said. There was no backing out without blowing my cover. The night before the funeral, I didn't sleep at all. I used every translation app I could find, watched YouTube videos about funeral phrases, even called my friend's mom, who was from Mexico, to practice what I might need.

And the wedding ended right there. I was adjusting Vanessa's veil in the bridal suite when she suddenly turned to me, her face twisted with stress and snapped, you know what, I can't do this anymore. I can't have Lily walking down the aisle looking like that. She'll ruin every single photo and I've spent $30,000 on this photographer. My daughter who had been excitedly practicing her flower girl walk in the corner froze midstep. Her little basket of rose petals slipping from her hands and scattering across the marble floor. The hotel suite fell into stunned silence as Vanessa continued her meltdown, seemingly oblivious to the damage she was causing. I mean, seriously, Kate, can you have gotten that lip thing fixed properly? Before my wedding, I specifically chose a white and gold theme and she just doesn't fit the aesthetic I'm going for. My mother, who had been steaming the bridesmaids dresses dropped the iron with a loud clang. The three bridesmaids stood frozen, their mouths agape while Lily, his eyes filled with tears as she finally understood what the pretty lady in the white dress was saying about her face. I am Kate Walsh and for the past two years I've watched my brother David fall completely under this woman's spell. As a wedding photographer myself, I've developed a keen eye for reading people and situations and everything about Vanessa Had always felt wrong to me. But what she didn't know was that her stress induced out burst had just confirmed something I'd suspected for months. And I had been quietly documenting her true character through overheard conversations and witness behaviors that I'd carefully noted in my phone. The journey to this moment started 18 months ago when David first brought Vanessa to a family barbecue. She seemed perfect on the surface, beautiful, charming and completely devoted to my brother. But I noticed small things that others missed. The way she would smile sweetly while making cutting remarks about people the moment they walked away. How she would compliment children to their faces, then whisper cruel observations to whoever was standing nearby. The first real red flag came during Thanksgiving last year. Lily had been born with a left lit that required three surgeries to repair. While the results were excellent and she was a gorgeous, confident child, she still occasionally felt self conscious about her appearance. During dinner, Vanessa had been particularly sweet to Lily, praising her dress and asking about school. But later while helping in the kitchen, I overheard her talking to her sister on the phone. Yeah, the whole family is here, including David's sister and her daughter with the weird lip, she had said thinking no one could hear her over the running water. Thank God David has good genes. I couldn't handle having a kid that look like that. The casual cruelty in her Voice made my blood run cold. But when I turned around, she he was already off the phone smiling at me like nothing had happened. From that point forward, I started paying closer attention. I began keeping notes in my phone whenever Vanessa said something cruel or revealing, not because I was planning anything specific, but because as a photographer, I'm trained to notice details that others miss and I wanted to document the patterns I was seeing. The evidence accumulated slowly. At Christmas, she made fun of my elderly aunt's trembling hands, calling it gross when she thought no one was listening. At David's birthday party, she rolled her eyes and called our cousin's autistic son that weird kid when his mother wasn't around. Each incident was small on its own, but together they painted a picture of someone who was fundamentally cruel when she thought she was safe from consequences. The most damaging evidence came from an unexpected source. Three months ago, Vanessa's college roommate, Jessica, reached out to me through social media. She had seen the engagement photos I'd posted and felt compelled to warn me about something. I don't know if I should tell you this. She had messaged me, but Vanessa and I are still friends on Facebook and she's been posting some really disturbing things about your family in a private group we're both in. Jessica sent me screenshots of posts Vanessa had made in a closed group called Wedding Stress Support. In these Posts Nessa had shared photos of our family gatherings and made cruel commentary about each family member. She called my father a pathetic loser who peaked in high school, described my mother as desperate and clingy, and referred to our grandmother as that senile old bat who never stops talking.

Beginning at No. 2, this is obviously a no brainer. We got the price. This helmet bro, is expensive. Don't get me wrong bro, you are paying for quality. Expect to pay at least 500 to 700 dollars if you wanna buy this helmet. If your school provides SHUT F7 helmets, big props to you. If you find this helmet that is cheaper in person you are lucky. Majority of time is gonna be sold out in person so you gotta pay for it online. Paying for this helmet online is gonna run you a couple of dollars. Last but not least, we got breaking in this helmet.

My son's elementary school started this reward system to stop kids from stealing. Basically, if you found something valuable like a wallet, backpack, or AirPods and turned it into the office, you get 10 bucks. Seems like a great idea at first. Promote honesty, stop theft, help kids learn morals. But then my son started coming home like he was sponsored by a vending machine. Day 1, 5 bags of chips. Day 2, 3 sodas, 2 packs of gum, and a full size Snickers bar. By day 4, this kid had an entire drawer in the kitchen labeled Snack Empire. And I knew he wasn't getting that with the $5 I gave him every Monday. So I sat him down like I was doing an interrogation on a crime show. Where are you getting this money? He paused. He tried making up an excuse, but I knew he was lying. Finally, he told me. He said it was the system. Oh, no, this kid wasn't finding lost stuff. He was creating it. He borrow his friends things in the morning, wait an hour, then miraculously find it under a bench or in the bathroom. Then he'd return it to the office like the ten dollar reward, split it with the friend, and do it again the next day. He literally had a rotation schedule. Tuesday is Marcus's AirPods, Wednesday is Ben's backpack. Thursday, I think I'm doing Ava's wallet again. In three weeks he made over 4 hundred dollars. My nine year old son had built a small criminal empire out of a second grade reward system. Even tried writing off one of the ipads in the computer lab like it was a community donation. And what did he use the money for? Snacks, obviously, but also a gold chain, a mini fridge, and a limited edition hoodie. At first I was furious. Then I realized he's smarter than half the adults I work with. So I handed him a $50 Bill and said, next week you should try robbing the teacher's lounge.

She wanted me to third wheel her date in disguise, like I was some undercover bodyguard. Ma'am, am I your friend or your FBI detail? I told her I couldn't.

You're so unreliable. This is why I can't trust men. Okay, you won't date me, but you're mad I won't protect you while you date other men. Cool. She got so mad, she canceled the date altogether and told me not to talk to her again. And, honestly, I was fine with it. Fast forward. A week later.

I stared at this card with rainbow crayons and sloppy handwriting, and honestly, I felt like someone punched me in the gut. The teacher had written from Emma in neat cursive underneath my eight year old daughter's messy signature. My hands were shaking as I read the note she'd attached. Emma came to me very upset, saying she didn't want to give you a card because you're mean to her. I convinced her that every mom deserves one, so I helped her make this. Here's the thing about being a single mom working two jobs. You don't realize how angry and exhausted you sound until your kid tells a teacher about it. Emma was right. I had been snapping at her constantly when she left her backpack at school. I yelled when she spilled juice on the carpet. I lost it when she asked me to read bedtime stories. I'd say I was too tired and just tuck her in without even sitting down. That night, Emma was already asleep when I got home from my second job at the diner. I sat on her bed and watched her little face. So peaceful. And I realized I couldn't remember the last time she'd smiled at me. Really smiled. Not that fake one kids do when they're scared of getting in trouble. The next morning, instead of rushing to get her ready, For school, like usual, I made pancakes. She looked confused when I sat down with her instead of running around looking for my keys and coffee mug. Why aren't you hurrying? She asked, cutting her pancakes into tiny pieces like she always did. I wanted to eat breakfast with you, I said. She smiled, and it was real. That's when I made a decision that probably saved our relationship. I called in sick to my morning job. Not just that day, but I put in my two weeks notice. We're going to have an adventure today, I told Emma. She got this excited look. Like Christmas morning. We went to the zoo, something I'd been promise

Grandpa said, we figured you wouldn't know how to handle that kind of money responsibly. I just nodded and said, good thinking. I'd hate for you to feel bad about your six figure gift when my business is already worth seven. This happened at my cousin Tyler's 21st birthday party. The whole family was there. Aunts, uncles, everyone. Grandpa had this tradition of announcing trust funds when his grandkids turned 21. Tyler got his announcement, then Emma got hers, then Jake. All six figures. When it was over, I waited for mine, but nothing came. After dinner I pulled Grandpa aside, what about my trust fund? He looked uncomfortable and said that thing about me not being responsible with money. He'd been watching me blow my paychecks on random stuff throughout college. Fair enough. I thought what Grandpa didn't know was that I've been running an online business since sophomore year. Started with buying broken phones, fixing them, and flipping them. Made decent money, so I expanded to laptops, then gaming consoles. By senior year I had a whole operation going. I it quiet because I didn't want family asking for handouts or thinking I was some tech genius when really I just watched YouTube tutorials and got lucky with timing. The random stuff Grandpa saw me buying, that was inventory. Broken electronics, repair tools, packaging supplies. He thought I was wasting money on junk when I was actually building Something after graduation, I moved back home and told everyone I was job hunting. Really? I was scaling up. Rented a small warehouse space, hired two part time workers, built relationships with electronic suppliers. The business was pulling in serious revenue. But I kept living like I was broke. Drove my beat up Honda, wore thrift store clothes, ate ramen for lunch. My cousins would joke about me being the family failure. Tyler got his trust fund and immediately bought a BMW. Emma went on expensive vacations.

This happened last year when I was a junior. Tyler had been picking on me since freshman year. Nothing major at first, just shoulder checks in the hallway and stealing my lunch money. But it got worse when he found out my mom cleaned offices at night to help pay our rent. Tyler would whisper things like, hey, poverty boy, did Mommy bring her mop to parent night? His friends thought it was hilarious. I tried ignoring him, but that just made him push harder. The breaking point came during gym class. We were playing dodgeball, and Tyler whipped a ball right at my face from, like, three feet away. I heard the crack before I felt the pain. Blood everywhere. My nose was completely sideways. Coach Williams rushed me to the nurse, and she immediately called an ambulance. The hospital. The doctor said my nose was broken in two places and I'd need surgery. My mom was crying, asking how we'd pay for it. When I got back to school three days later with this huge bandage across my face, I figured Tyler would at least get suspended. Wrong. Mr. Henderson, our vice principal, called me into his office instead. Now, Adrian, he said, adjusting his glasses, Tyler's parents are very upset about this incident. They feel you provoked their son by not moving out of the Way fast enough. I stared at him. He broke my nose on purpose. That's a serious accusation, Mister. Henderson replied. The Williams family has been very generous to our school. They funded our new computer lab and donate thousands every year. We need to handle this delicately. Then he dropped the bomb. I think it would be best if you apologize to Tyler and his parents for causing this misunderstanding. I couldn't believe it. You want me to apologize to him? Think of it as taking the

So while this document exists that Beth is gone and no one's talked to him, they're still sitting there trying to see her. Eventually, they let Beth's mom in for minutes and she said that Beth was cold to the touch, that she was on life support and she was barely alive. Finally, after all of this, Luke is able to talk to the doctors where they're talking about Beth's care and how she's allergic to penicillin. And the doctors were shocked because they had no idea that she was allergic to penicillin, even though, like I said at the beginning, he made the paramedics aware. Luke ends up finding this private hospital that he wanted to transfer Beth to. They finally said, yes, we'll take her. And shortly after he gets the call that she is actually officially gone, after being told she's gone, the hospital says, oh, hey, we need $2,000 from you and still won't let him see her. And then the police come back and they say, hey, Beth is being buried tomorrow. And Luke said, absolutely not. I'll pay whatever I have to. I'm not leaving her here. And on top of that, they gave him no time to grieve cause he has to go back for another interview cause he's still A suspect. The following day, he's interviewed in a van with a desk bolted to the ground. For hours. He cooperated and finally the police were like, okay, this is just a grieving husband. We were wrong. After sobbing, begging and pleading, he was allowed to go see his wife, but only for exactly one minute with staff standing over his shoulder. Later on, Beth is put in a black body bag where Luke, her own mother, and a friend had to carry her by holding the corners of this bag. Another man also helped them who was like tapping on her like he was bored. So he is now stuck in this country paying thousands of dollars trying to arrange for Beth to actually be flown back to the UK his children and the grandparents left. He's there all by himself without his wife. He finally arranges himself to get her sent back and that is when they pay for an autopsy in the UK and do you know what they found or what they didn't find? Her heart. Her heart was taken out of her body with no consent, no explanation. It was just gone. He then had the displeasure of telling his children that their mother was gone after all that trauma, after being looked at as a suspect, after not even being able to see her, and then to know they took a part of her they had no right to take. And they have asked For the story to be shared everywhere. And I truly hope that justice will come.

The following morning, Beth was feeling extremely sick and delirious. And so immediately, Luke starts looking for a doctor or some sort of medical help for her. There's a language barrier. The family's from the UK, so it's very difficult. Eventually, he's able to get an ambulance to come pick Beth up. He tells the EMS that she is allergic to penicillin. And then Luke and the children get in a taxi and follow behind. Eventually, they arrive at the hospital and Beth is immediately being poked and prodded by the medical professionals. They were having to hold her down. The children are seeing this. They are traumatized. So Luke decides he needs to trust the doctors. His children do not need to see all of this. They need to go. So he leaves with the children. That is the last time that he saw her alive. So Luke ends up calling both grandparents, asking them to come out so that they can watch the kids, so he can be with his wife. And so they start working on flying to Turkey. He's back at the hotel and suddenly he gets a call saying that it's urgent. He needs to get to the hospital because he needs to pay upfront for scans. So he and the children go back to the hospital, pay and they go back to the hotel. That night, Beth is put In the ICU and he is officially banned from seeing her. The doctors would not call him, went and tell him what was going on. He called many times. They refused to tell him anything. The following day, the grandparents arrive and they go to the hospital to find Beth. She's not there. She had been moved and they were never told. Later on, he's eventually told, oh, hey, yeah, we transferred her to another hospital. Oddly enough, Beth is transferred back to the original hospital because of concerns for her heart. Finally, with little to no help from anyone else, Beth's mother is able to find her room. She wants to go inside and see her daughter. As when the medical staff said you can see her in five minutes, you can see her in 10 minutes. Oh, another 10 minutes. Hours pass and they will not let a mother go see her daughter. All of that is upsetting in itself, but what happens next is unbelievable. Luke is at the hotel with his children when the Turkish police show up with no translator. He had to have hotel staff try to figure out what both of them were saying. They made him sign a document in another language that he did not understand. And when he later translated it, it said that his wife had passed away at 9:00am. Not one word from the hospital. When he's texting Beth's mom trying to get, you know, updates, she had No idea what was going on. Now he's a suspect. And what's happening to Beth?

And the answer is he had him from Day 1 and his name was Tyreek Hill. Matthew Stafford walked into Detroit and his best wide receiver from Day 1 was Calvin Johnson. Sure, the Lions weren't world beaters, but they immediately locked down their QB receiver duo for the future. Philip Rivers was drafted to the Chargers in 2004 and from day one his best receiving target was Antonio Gates. Not to mention prime Malcolm Thomas in the backfield. Holmes hasn't gotten an ounce of sympathy from NFL fans in the media because he inherited the greatest offensive cheat code of the late 20 in Tyreek Hill and arguably the greatest pass catching tight end in Travis Kelce. But every QB goes through a phase where they have a lot of weapons and then they don't. I think Tom Brady is a great example of this. And Mahomes actually did this in his last two Super Bowl wins. Tom didn't start with the great offense then got Randy Moss, but was still able to win at the highest level after Randy's departure with guys like Julian Edelman, Danny Amendola, and Jake Hogan. Of course Rob Gronkowski. Does Lamar have the better offensive support?

Why do I get the feeling this is about to be extremely disrespectful after seeing what they did to the receivers? Yeah, it's gonna be. Nick Bosa, you are a 98, huh? Oh, okay, Cool. Michael Parsons, you are a 97. Okay, I'm not complaining, but I play basically every position on the field and I play it well. Why am I not a 99? You play too many positions and it's confusing for us, so you don't have a good reason. Got it. We almost never do. Chris Jones, you are a 96. Why am I underrated every year? Is it because my name is too boring? If I change my name to Sack Daddy Mctacklesworth, will my rating go up? Probably. Miles Garrett, you are a 98. Wait, you put me in the 99 club last year and I just had the same number of sacks, more tackles and more fumbles in the year before. What happened? Well, you missed a game last year while you played all 17 the year before. You know what they say, the best ability is availability. You guys are docking me a full point because of one missed game. Yep, glad we're on the same page while we're on the subject. TJ Watt, you are a 94. Okay, I'm not happy about it, but at least you guys are consistent. Missing games means your rating goes down. And as long as we're All playing by those same rules. I guess I can understand. And I'd like to welcome Aaron Donald back to the 99 Club. Okay, what the fuck, huh? The dude missed six games and had less sex than I did. You just said you base your ratings on availability. Okay, look, determining a Madden rating is a very.

I thought we already did this. Yeah, we did. I decided on six games, remember? No, you recommended six games. We were never actually gonna listen to you. You're like a speed limit sign, whatever. What are you giving him? Well, after careful consideration, we've decided to suspend Deshaun Watson for 11 games. Wow. Honestly, still seems kind of light. What was that? Nothing. Hey, how'd you come up with 11 though? I mean, forget the fact that we were kind of bracing for a full season suspension, but why 11 and not, I don't know, 12? It's a more even number. It's exactly double the length of the original suspension. What do you want, an extra game? No, obviously not. I'm just curious about the thought process. Well, if you must know, we examined all the suspensions handed out over the years and cross referenced it. Hold on, am I looking at this right? Desean's first game back is gonna be against the Houston Texans. I'm sorry, what? Oh, is it? That's a weird coincidence. That's not a coincidence. You're trying to make yourself look like the good guys by suspending him for more games only to bring him back for the most high profile return game possible. We just really like money. You're sick. We know. Alright, quarterbacks, I already talked to the receivers. So are you ready to hear your Madden ratings? No, we're not doing this. What We don't care about your Madden ratings, dude. What do you mean these are important? No, no, they're not. Look, we know how this.
