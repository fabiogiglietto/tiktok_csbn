We have been seeing each other for a year and everything looked and seemed like we are a couple. He said he loved me and I him. He spends every weekend with me and we have planned our first trip together, etc. Last weekend he was in bed and I made him pancakes because his birthday was on Tuesday. He was very happy about it and joked that I was spoiling him. I said that I wanted to spoil my man. I said I am not your man with the same energy. He didn't seem awkward or embarrassed, just as calm with a smile on his stupid face. I didn't take it seriously and said, yeah, I know you are not my man. He was more serious now and said, no, really, I am not your boyfriend. I felt sick, but I tried to be calm and I asked what we are. He said I don't know. Great FWB. I didn't say anything after that and he ate his pancakes in silence. Later he asked if we would do anything. I said that I was planning on cleaning and doing some paperwork. He left after an hour. I ran to the bathroom to be sick and I probably cried for a solid two hours. I couldn't keep anything in my stomach for the rest of the day. He texted that evening thanking me for the breakfast in Bed and that he thought I was amazing but I didn't answer. So he called a few times. I didn't answer. Around ten PM he rang my door. I just opened a jar and pretended I was sick with the flu and was going to bed. He offered to stay the night in case I needed help during the night and I said no. I didn't answer him on Sunday or Monday, and I didn't wish him a happy birthday on Tuesday either. And I have just been keeping it short text feigning sickness. He never brought up what he said once. Then yesterday he wrote that he missed me and that he hadn't gone this long without talking to me since we met and that he was going mad. He asked if we could at least have dinner. I said that I was very busy. He said don't you miss me? I said that I was very tired because I was out all night with a guy last night.

I've been keeping this notebook for six years and my girlfriend had no clue until last week. She always said I never opened up emotionally. But honestly, I just thought guys weren't supposed to talk about all the little things they notice. Growing up, my dad forgot everyone's birthday. My mom couldn't remember who liked what food. Their fights were brutal because nobody paid attention to anyone. I swore I'd never be that type of boyfriend. So in college, I started writing stuff down about whoever I was dating. Not weird stalker stuff, just normal things like how Ashley preferred hot chocolate when it rained but iced coffee when it was sunny. Or how Jessica's voice got higher when she was nervous about something. When I met Mia three years ago, the notebook got way more detailed. I wrote down everything, how she stirred her cereal exactly seven times before eating it, how she hummed the same tune when she was happy, how her left eyebrow twitched right before she'd start laughing at something. Every few weeks, I'd add new stuff, like how she only wore her lucky socks on job interview days or how she needed exactly eight minutes of silence when she got home from work before she could handle talking. I wrote down that she liked her apartment at exactly 72 degrees, not 71 or 73, that she always ordered extra pickles but never ate them, that she got cranky If she didn't eat something by 11:00am but never admitted she was hungry, the notebook helped me figure out when to give her space and when to push her to talk about stuff, when to play upbeat music and when she needed something sad. I knew she was stressed when she started reorganizing her bookshelf, so I'd order her favorite Thai food before she even realized she was hungry. When she was upset, she'd clean the bathroom obsessively so I'd run her a bath afterward. None of this felt calculated or weird to me. It just seemed like paying attention. But I never told her about it because it sounded super intense. When I thought about explaining it, like, hey, hey, babe, I've been documenting your behavior patterns for 3 years. Doesn't exactly sound romantic. Plus, guys don't really talk about this stuff with each other. I figured she'd think I was some kind of control freak or something. Last Tuesday, she was cleaning our home office while I was at work. She called me freaking out, asking why I had a notebook with her name on it hidden behind my desk. Panicked, thinking she'd found something embarrassing. But she said she hadn't opened it yet. She was waiting for me to get home to explain. The drive home felt like forever. I kept imagining her thinking I was documenting her flaws or planning to break up with her or something crazy. When I got there, she was sitting on The

My cousin Rachel just buried her husband and two kids last week. Car accident took them all at once. She's left with just her 5 year old daughter Emma. And honestly, watching them at the funeral was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So my brother Jake and his wife Kelly show up to our house that morning before we head to the church. First thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral. And she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. The cemetery, she literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would mention How hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I know. Now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce pregnant lady coming through or baby on board needs to pee. There were like 30 people there grieving. And she's treating it like her personal pregnancy announcement party. But then she crossed the line. Rachel was sitting.

The bride stopped mid pose. Her photographer looked confused and about 30 wedding guests turned to stare at my three year old daughter Emma standing by the playground swings. I was mortified. Emma had this habit of saying random things loudly at the worst possible moments, but this was next level embarrassing. Ma, honey, let's go play on the slides, I whispered, trying to drag her away from the wedding party, but she wasn't having it. She broke free from my grip and marched right up to the bride, tugging on her dress. Lady, don't marry the mean man, Emma said, pointing directly at the groom. He's gonna hurt you. Everyone went dead silent. The groom's face went red and he started walking toward us looking angry. Hey, what kind of kid says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just 3 and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve. My mommy had marks like that when the bad man lived with us. She cried at night, too, just like you smell like tears under your makeup. My heart stopped. This kid had been through way too much for her age, but she developed This weird ability to spot things adults tried to hide. When my ex was still around, Emma would always know when I'd been crying, even if I thought I'd covered it up perfectly.

I pulled out my laptop, opened my banking app and started clicking. Her laughter died when she heard the notification sounds. What are you doing? Still silent. Removed her from my car insurance, canceled her phone plan that I paid for. Click. Change the Netflix password she used daily. Michael, stop. This isn't funny anymore. But I wasn't done. Logged into our shared Spotify account, change the password. Then Amazon Prime, then Hulu, then Disney plus. Every single subscription she used but never paid for. Even changed the Wi Fi password on our router. Are you seriously going through every account right now? Next, I opened my credit card app, removed her as an authorized user. Then my gym membership, cancelled her guest privileges. My Costco card revoked her access. This is insane. You're being psychotic. I grabbed my suitcase and headed for the door. She jumped up. Panic setting in. Wait, where are you going? You can't just leave. Finally spoke. You asked what I was going to do. I'm showing you. My phone buzzed. Uber outside. Michael, I'm sorry. It meant nothing. Then neither does this. I walked out. The Uber driver was cool, helped me load my stuff without Asking questions. We drove away. I saw her standing in the doorway still holding her dead phone, realizing she couldn't even connect to Wi Fi to call for help. 20 minutes later, my phone exploded. Her number was already disconnected since I'd cancelled the plan. But her friends started texting me. She's crying at Starbucks because she can't call an Uber without her phone plan. She tried to drive home but remembered you took her off insurance. She's asking everyone for Netflix passwords because she was watching a show. She went to the gym and they wouldn't let her in. Then came the really good stuff. Her sister called me. Michael, what did you do? Madison's at my place having a complete meltdown. I did exactly what she suggested. She says you cut off everything, her phone, insurance, streaming accounts, gym access. That's petty. Petty is texting your ex behind your boyfriend's back for two months. Two months, she said.

She's been lying to everyone. I read through more of those texts. She was planning to leave you, I know, right after her ex said he wasn't ready for a relationship. So you were her backup plan.

So I cooked up something that made her want to die. My sister Meredith discovered the perfect scam when she was 12 years old. She Learned that faking allergies got her whatever she wanted. The first time it happened was at a birthday party. She didn't like the chocolate cake, so she told everyone she was allergic to cocoa. Boom, special vanilla cupcake just for her. By high school, she carried a list of 37 fake allergies, gluten, dairy, shellfish, nuts, red dye, MSG, you name it, she was dying from it. Parents change everything for Meredith's medical needs, special meals, special shopping trips, special everything. Meanwhile, I'd catch her sneaking pizza in her room at midnight, the same pizza that would kill her at dinner. When I got into culinary school, Meredith suddenly couldn't breathe around cooking oil. She'd walk by the kitchen and fall on the floor gasping. Mom made me practice cooking in the garage because Meredith's life was at risk. Opening my food truck should have been the best day of my life. Three years of saving every penny I had. Went into Nora's kitchen first day, lunch rush. There's Meredith. She ordered a salad, took one bite and threw herself on the ground. She was rolling around screaming that I poisoned her, clutching her throat, fake tears, full show. Someone called 9, 1 1. She told the paramedics I put gluten in her food on purpose. The hospital photos went everywhere. Online. My Yelp page got destroyed. People called me a murderer. I had to close for a week, lost thousands in sales. I finally saved enough to open a real restaurant. She did it again. Soft opening night. The place was packed with food critics and investors. Meredith touched a shrimp and went into fake shock. She was thashing on the floor. Her boyfriend, Caleb pretended to give her CPR. Everyone was filming. The health department shut me down the next day. My parents believed every lie. Dad said I should have been more careful. Mom banned me from Sunday dinners because my clothes might have bits of food on them. They spent thousands on fake EP pens while I was drowning in debt. Then came my biggest chance ever. Food Network called. They wanted me for their new show, Rising Star Chefs. Ten years of work LED to this moment. This was everything. Three hours before filming, Meredith called the producers, told them I sent her to the hospital at Thanksgiving by getting food on her plate. She sent fake medical records and to sue. They dropped me instantly. Too much risk, they said. That's when I snapped. Meredith was going to learn what real fear felt like. See, while Meredith faked being scared of food, she had one real fear, mice. Found one in her dollhouse at age 8 and never got over it. Just hearing a squeak made her panic. I started Recording her at her boyfriend's place got weeks of footage. Meredith eating pizza with extra cheese, shrimp with peanut sauce, everything that would supposedly kill her. She was having a feast while ruining my life. I bought 50 mice from a pet store, told them I had hungry snakes. Also bought jars of peanut butter, her deadliest allergy. I texted Meredith about making up over lunch, picked a restaurant across town that specialized in allergy free food. She loved the attention, posted photos about forgiving her sister while she was gone.

At my school, we created snitch lottery that spiraled into madness. My friend got accused of cheating by this girl who tattled on everyone. We were sick of it. I suggested putting fake confessions in the anonymous tip box. Nothing harmful, just ridiculous things like I'm replacing cafeteria salt with sugar or I'm hiding all the markers. Each Friday when the principal read concerns, we'd silently celebrate. Soon, our whole group was making confessions more outlandish. Each week, word spread and half the school will join. Kids bet on which confession would make assembly. Teams formed to create believable yet impossible scenarios. Things went nuclear when someone confessed to breeding raccoons in the ceiling. The principal called animal control who searched all day. While we tried not to lose it, teachers became paranoid looking for rule breakers who didn't exist. The counselor held meetings about the uptick and bizarre behaviour. The breaking point came when someone wrote about laxatives and faculty coffee. Though it never happened, five teachers called in sick. Next day they traced the handwriting and caught a senior. The principal was livid. They removed the tip box and threatened suspension for fabricating safety concerns. Snitch Lottery died that day, but for two months, we made our boring school believe it was losing its mind.

She thought it would secure her a payout until the judge asked one question. You ever see someone's face when their own lie destroys them? Because I got a front row seat to that exact moment. Natalie walked into that courtroom eight months pregnant, glowing with confidence. She I've been stalling our divorce for a year with every trick in the book, fake emergencies, missing paperwork, sudden mental health crises that required postponements. But this, this was her grand finale. The plan was obvious. Walk in looking vulnerable, play the abandoned pregnant wife card and watch the judge throw out our iron clad prenup out of pure sympathy. He'd done her research, too, picked a female judge thinking the sisterhood would work in her favor. What Natalie didn't realize was that her own paranoia had already destroyed her. Six months earlier during one of our screaming matches, she'd called the cops claiming I'd threatened her. Complete lie. But she ran with it, filed a restraining order. The next day stood in front of a judge with crocodile tears claiming I was violent and dangerous, said she feared for her life and needed protect action. The judge bought it, granted the order immediately. I couldn't come within 500 feet of her, couldn't contact her, couldn't even drive down our old street. My lawyer advised me not to fight it, just let the divorce proceed and move on. So I did. Exactly That followed that restraining order to the letter. Didn't call, didn't text. I didn't even look in her direction when I saw her at the grocery store. I had witnesses, security footage, phone records, everything proving I'd stayed away. But here's the thing about restraining orders that Natalie forgot. They create a paper trail. Every violation gets documented. Every interaction gets recorded. The court system tracks everything. Fast forward to today. Natalie strutted in wearing a designer maternity dress, one hand on her belly, the other clutching tissues for the Waterworks. It even brought her mother. For extra sympathy points, her lawyer started the sob story immediately, painted me as the classic deadbeat dad who'd abandoned his pregnant wife, talked about her financial hardship and how she'd been left with nothing while carrying our child. Natalie sat there, nodding occasionally, dabbing her eyes, playing the victim to perfection. She even threw in protective hand gestures over her belly whenever the lawyer mentioned my name. My lawyer stayed quiet, letting them dig their own grave. When it was his turn, he simply stood up and said, your honour, before we address any financial claims, I believe we need to clarify something important. That's when he pulled out the court records, restraining order application, the sworn statements, the police reports, everything Natalie had filed claiming I was a dangerous monster. The judge reviewed the documents, her expression growing serious. she looked up at Natalie and asked the question that ended everything.

Girl, when I tell you, I almost fainted when the school called me. I ain't even playing. So it's a regular Thursday. I'm in the middle of target looking for a throw pillow that matches absolutely nothing. And my phone rings. Caller ID says Lincoln Elementary. My stomach drop. I thought, oh, god, did she fall off the monkey bars again? Did she hit someone? Or worse, did she say something? Think she heard me say? So I answer all fake sweet, like, hi, this is her mom. And the lady on the other end says, ma'am, we need you to come in immediately. Your daughter had an incident. Now listen, my daughter Layla is cute, like real cute. Big eyes, big hair, big attitude. She's 8, but she's also part gremlin when she's hungry or bored. So I throw the pillows back, leave the car and speed down to that school like it's the Indie 500. I walk in, heart pounding, and the secretary just points at the principal's office like, yeah, she's in there. I open the door and baby Layla is sitting there with her arms crossed like a little mob boss. Principal looking nervous. There's a boy across from her with an ice pack on his head and a teacher looking like she aged 10 years today. I go, Layla, what did you do? She goes, he tried to take my cookie. So I defended myself. Calm like She's in court. The principal sighs and says she hit him with a lunch tray. I blinked. I'm sorry. She what? Now the teacher jumps in. She told the boy, touch it and you lose a finger. We thought she was joking. Next thing we know, he grabs her cookie and boom, metal tray to the forehead. I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing because I know where she got that line, me. She got it from me. I said that last week about my fries at Chili's. But I clear my throat and say, Layla, you can't go around hitting people. He goes, he tried to rob me. What was I supposed to do care? Like it's a fairy tale. That cookie had my name on it in Sharpie. I wrote it. Possession is 9/10 of the law, y'all. She hit him with legal terms. The boy starts sniffling like he's the victim here. And Layla leans in and says, you should have asked. Now look at you. I stocked up like leftovers. I had to turn around and pretend to cough so I wouldn't laugh. I'm dying inside. The principal says, we don't condone violence. Layla goes, neither do I, but I condone consequences. I swear, this child is either gonna be a lawyer or in jail. So I take her home, try to give her a serious talk. I go, he can't be violent. Even if you're right, there's rules. She Goes exactly rule No. 1, don't touch my food. I said, Layla, I'm serious. She goes, okay, okay. Next time I'll use words. Maybe. Probably. And then y'all ready for the kicker? That night, I get a text from the mom of the boy. I'm bracing myself.

I live in a sketchy little neighborhood where everyone minds their business except for this one dude. Let's call him Rico. Rico is, well, he's like a local cryptid. No one knows where he lives but he appears at 3:00am yelling about government conspiracies, anime girls and how he once fought a raccoon with his bare hands. Classic Rico. Anyway, last night I'm walking back from the corner store with a bag of Hot Cheetos and chocolate milk living my best trashy life when out of nowhere Rico lunges at me like a feral possum in heat. He's screaming something about me stealing his aura. At this point my fight or flight kicked in and apparently my brain chose black magic. See, I've been dabbling in some alternative arts lately. Long story short, I had a transformation Hex saved on my notes app. Don't ask why, just accept it. So mid lunch I screamed the words, clap my hands together and suddenly poof, Rico is no longer Rico. Rico is now Rianna. Pink crop top, cat ears, thigh high socks, eyeliner sharper than my credit score, the full Femboy starter pack. He blinks, I blink. We both stand there for a solid five seconds like, did that just happen? Fast forward to today and uh, I may have listed him on Etsy under Handcrafted Chaos Beings. Someone from Portland bought him within 3 Minutes for 275 plus shipping. Now I'm sitting here sipping my chocolate milk, trying to process the fact that I may have invented a new side hustle. Before anyone asks, yes, Rico. Now Rianna is thriving. The buyer sent me pics. He's got a made outfit. Now I don't know how to feel.

Brad thought scaring people was hilarious, and his kids did, too. Every morning, his dogs attack the fence while his boys laughed at crying kindergartners. At the 4th of July barbecue, he let all three dogs loose while his kids timed the chaos. When our HOA tried discussing dog rules, Brad brought his meanest one and nobody would speak up. His brother worked for animal Control and made complaints disappear. Here, things got worse. After Brad realized nobody would stop him, he started training his dogs in the front yard while his boys kept score. They had a whole system where old people were worth one point, but runners were worth five. His wife Lauren started taking the kids to her mother's house during training sessions. I tried asking him to keep the dogs in back during school hours. The next day, his older son stood at the bus stop with Rex. The chain was just short enough to not reach the sidewalk. Kids pressed against the opposite fence anyway. Brad filmed it from his porch while his younger boy counted how many kids cried. Whenever anyone complained, Brad would claim discrimination against pitbulls. He threatened to sue for harassment and mention his brother at animal control. he'd let his dogs accidentally get loose near the complainer's house. he started bringing raw meat to the park during Family picnics, his dogs would fight over it while his kids cheered. At the farmers market, he'd act shocked when they lunged at other pets. Lauren stopped coming to neighborhood events after people begged her to intervene. My puppy Milo was everything Brad's dogs weren't. My mom gave him to me two weeks before she died of cancer. He was this gentle golden retriever who loved everyone. Brad kept saying I was raising a marshmallow, not a dog. That morning, I just let Milo out. When I noticed Brad's kids by their back, the older boy was teaching the younger one something about the latch. I had a bad feeling and moved toward the door. Pull it fast and watch him work, the kid said. The gate flew open and Rex burst through like a missile. I screamed and ran but knew I wouldn't make it. Rex hit Milo hard and went straight for his throat. Brad appeared on his deck holding his Sunday newspaper and coffee. His kids whooped and hollered while my puppy fought for his life. I pleaded with Brad to intervene. He checked his watch like he was timing it. The emergency vet couldn't save Milo. She said Rex has been trained for quick kills, not regular dog fights. The police claimed without video evidence, their hands were tied. Brad's response when I confronted him was that I'd Learned why people get real Protection dogs. His kids high fived him and went back inside. I buried Milo under his favorite tree and spent a week planning. Brad posted constantly about hunting trips and being an APEX predator. He thought fear was entertainment, but I'd show him what being prey felt like. I studied the woods behind our properties and found paths between the trees. Mrs. Chen.

Ask around. Nobody has ever. Three, raw eggs are mostly fine for you. It's not impossible, but you're highly unlikely to get salmonella from eating them. The reason you shouldn't eat raw cookie dough is the raw flour, which is actually dangerous, not the raw eggs. Four, paper wasps. They're incredibly docile. Every year they build a nest above my back door. Even if there's dozens of them swarming around, they won't bother you if you don't bother them. They're fascinating creatures to observe. You can actually feed them by hand by dipping your finger in syrup, honey or anything sugary. They'll lick it right off. Five years of coexisting with them and I have yet to get stung. Plus, having their nest over the door deters burglars. 5, nuclear power, the safest energy source humanity has ever known. Fun nuclear fact, if you swam near the surface of a nuclear containment pool with actual glowing radioactive spent fuel rods in the bottom, you would receive less radiation than if you just stood out in the sun. 6. Not that I would know, but apparently and scientifically, taking L s. D in a reasonable dose and many other psychodelics, it is almost no risk for physical or mental addiction harm. According to medical and psychological studies. On the other hand, there are a lot of potential benefits regarding mental health, especially if you compare it with legal stuff like cigarettes or alcohol, which are both one of the most harmful substances in existence. But most people think psychedelics are on the same level as real hard stuff such as meth or heroin, just because they only classify illegal and illegal. This is no advice, just my opinion based on a ton of research. 7, eating food that's a bit past the cell by date. 8, msg. And it's so good. Put that on your eggs.

I lost my son to the streets when he was 14. That was it. Deshawn started running with the nigelatron, stealing, carrying guns, disappearing for weeks at a time. His dad was in prison, so it was just me working double shifts at the hospital while watching my baby throw his life away piece by piece. But I thought like hell to get him back. I never stopped praying he'd come home alive. That year, everything changed completely. Deshawn got arrested on a weapons charge, facing 10 years as an adult. But the feds made him an offer. Cooperate with their investigation, testify against his crew, and he'd get probation plus witness Protection. Promised me he'd be safe. We've done this hundreds of times, Mrs. Serena. Your son will be completely protected. This is his ticket out of this life forever. Deshawn took the deal without hesitation. When he was freed eight months later, something was different in his eyes. He looked at me and said, Mama, I'm done with this life. I wanna make you proud for once. The prosecutors relocated us across town. New apartment, new phone numbers, new identities. They said the gang thought he was still locked up. We were completely invisible. I went overboard helping him rebuild his entire future. Got him enrolled in GED classes, drove him to community college. Every morning at 7:00am sharp, he studied like his life depended on it. Which It literally did. Applied to Howard University for business administration. Talked constantly about opening an auto shop, helping kids like himself escape the streets. When the Howard acceptance letter came in March, full scholarship, he screamed so loud, the neighbors complained. First person in our family to go to university. He was glowing with pure joy and pride. His community college graduation was May 20th. Then Howard in the fall. I took my first vacation day in three years. Bought a new dress from the department store, got my hair done professionally. I wanted to look perfect when they called his name. Deshawn had his speech memorized. Practiced it every morning in the bathroom mirror. The night before graduation, Deshawn was trying on his cap and gown for the hundredth time, practicing his walk across an imaginary stage. I was making his favorite dinner, my grandmother's fried chicken recipe. We stayed up late talking about Howard. He hugged me tight and said, and tomorrow is our day, Mama. We made it. That morning, Deshawn woke me up at 6:00am, grinning ear to ear. Graduation day, he yelled. We had breakfast together. He put on his suit, and I took pictures of him in his cap and gown. He left early to get to the venue and practice his speech one more time. I was driving to the ceremony alone, singing along to the radio, when my phone rang. It was the hospital Miss

My parents were furious but weirdly supportive. They helped me finish high school online and I gave birth to my son Tommy over Christmas break with jingle bells playing in the background.

We lived in a tiny shoebox apartment with a couch I bought off Craigslist for $15 and dreams duct taped together. But it worked. By the time Tommy was 10, I was a pediatric ICU nurse and he was this funny, smart, ridiculous little human who made life fun even on two hours of sleep. Then I met Daniel. Daniel's a pediatric surgeon, smart, kind, didn't blink when I told him I had a 10 year old. On our third date, Tommy had a cold and Daniel brought over soup and comic books. I think I fell in love right then. Two years later, we got married and Daniel adopted Tommy. Tommy calls him dad like he Was born to because honestly, he kind of was. We had twin girls three years ago and Tommy is the sweetest big brother. Straight a student, star pitcher for his high school and I mean star college scouts come to see him. Then last month, his team made it to the state championships. I was screaming my lungs out from the bleachers, phone in hand, filming every pitch like a full blown stage, mom. That's when I saw Jake. Same face, just older. He was staring at Tommy like he was.

In my family, there was one rule. I needed my twin's permission to seek medical help. I was watching Vanessa practice her birthday speech when my lungs seized up. I reached for my inhaler on the coffee table, but mom snatched it away. Vanessa, does Ellie need this? My twin didn't even look up from her phone. She used it at lunch. She fine. You heard your sister. Mom dropped my inhaler in her purse. No attention seeking. Today, it's Vanessa's sweet 16th. The rule had been in place since we were 12. The day I faked pneumonia during Vanessa's ballet recital. I hadn't faked it, but Vanessa said I had. So that became the truth. From then on, every headache, every fever, every asthma attack had to be verified by the golden twin. Can't breathe. The wheeze was starting. That whistling sound my doctor called your body's alarm bell, Ellie. Dad's voice boomed from the door. What do we do when you claim you're sick? I knew the script. Ask Vanessa first. And what did Vanessa say? Vanessa finally looked up, annoyed. I said, she's fine. Gosh, Ellie, do you have to make my day about you? My chest was tightening like someone was sitting on it. Breath felt like sucking air through a coffee stirrer. Please, I gasped. Need hospital, mom. Vanessa whined. She's doing it again. Make her stop. Mom rushed to comfort Vanessa. Don't worry, sweetie. Ellie, go to your room. If you're going to act like this, the modelling scout will be here soon. I tried to stand but had to grip the couch. My fingernails were starting to tinge blue. Look, I held up my hands. Vanessa laughed. She probably painted them blue. Remember when she faked passing out at my recital? I hadn't faked it. I had an asthma attack. But Vanessa told everyone I was jealous. So my parents refused to leave her performance. Doorbell rang. Party guests started to arrive. Ellie, disappear. Dad ordered. Vanessa's modelling scout is coming. We don't need you. Wheezing in the background, I couldn't move. My lungs were working overtime, visible through my shirt. Every breath was a battle I was losing. Mom, please, I need hospital, Vanessa. Mom called out sweetly, your sister's asking for the hospital. What do you think, Vanessa? She stood directly in front of me, blocking my parents view. For a second, I saw something flicker in her eyes. She's faking, Vanessa announced loudly. She's just mad. Ted's coming. Ted, my childhood friend who Vanessa stole just because she could. I knew it. Mom shouted, Ellie, stop this immediately. That's when I started coughing blood. Vanessa's best friend, Jenny walked in and froze. Oh, my gosh. What's wrong with Ellie? Nothing Vanessa said. She's being dramatic. Vanessa, she's coughing blood. No, they're not. Vanessa stepped in front of me again. Everything's perfect. Go help with decorations. But Jenny was premed. She Pushed past Vanessa and grabbed my wrist. Her pulse is racing. This is a medical emergency. We don't do medical emergencies without Vanessa's approval. Dad said like it was totally normal house rules. What? Jenny looked horrified. Vanessa knows Ellie best. Mom explained she can tell when Ellie's really sick versus performing. Performing. Jenny was already dialing 9, 1, 1. She's in respiratory failure. Give me that phone, dad lunged.

We had the weirdest rule in probably the entire state. No closed doors while changing clothes, ever. Not my bedroom door, not the bathroom, not even the closet. Teenagers hide tattoos all over their body if we let them, dad would say, or they could be hiding pills in their pockets. My friends were horrified when they heard about it. Mickey came over once and watched me change from school clothes to normal one and right in the middle of our living room while dad sat there with his newspaper glancing up every few seconds. That's so creepy, she whispered. And I wanted to disappear. My older brother had already escaped to college partly because of rules like this. I counted days until I could leave, too. Mom tried to help without directly challenging dad. She couldn't change his mind about the rule, but she found ways around it. The shower has frosted glass. Mentioned one day while folding towels, you're only visible as a shadow. She also helped me rearrange my room, putting my full length mirror at an angle where it looked like you could see everything from the doorway, but there was actually a blind spot. Perfect for 30 second wardrobe changes. I got really good at it too. I kept spare clothes in the bathroom and changed when dad was busy watching TV. Mom would create distractions, calling dad to fix something right when I Needed to change for school. For weeks, this worked perfectly. Dad thought he was enforcing his rules since door stayed open. He even bragged to his co workers about how his visibility system kept me safe. But then one weekend, everything exploded in ways I never imagined. Dad's colleague Rob came by to drop off work files. Dad was on a video call in his office. Mom was grocery shopping. And I just gotten home from track with my entire body sweating. I couldn't wait for Dad's call to end. So I ducked behind my mirror blind spot like always. But Rob didn't know our house layout. He was looking for Dad's office and saw what looked completely wrong from his angle, a teenage girl hiding behind furniture to undress. He looked away immediately but asked me a question that sounded oddly serious. Where's your father? I pointed to Dad's office and he took off through the door. I heard him say, Jim, your daughter was hiding behind furniture to change clothes. Combined with these visibility rules you mentioned, dad came out confused at first. She knows the rules about doors. Rob shook his head. Jim, she was hiding behind furniture to change. That is not okay. You're making her feel unsafe the way.

We'll make your sister pay. She'll never say no to family. I froze with the grocery bags in my hands. Through the kitchen window, I could see them all sitting around the table, Mom, Dad and my brother Landon. Harper's got that new job, dad was saying, making good money now. We'll just tell her it's for Mom's surgery. Mom nodded. She gave us 12,000 for the roof last year, no questions asked. My stomach dropped. There was no roof repair. I'd seen the receipts myself. They'd used my money for Landon's gambling debts. How much this time, mom asked. 50,000, Landon said casually, maybe 60 if we play it right. Tell her the cancer came back. Cancer. They were going to fake cancer to steal from me. I backed away slowly, my mind racing. The cancer scare from two years ago, the one that made me liquidate my retirement fund to pay for experimental treatments. Had that been fake, too? I thought about all the times I'd help. The car accident that wasn't covered by insurance, Landon's business that needed start up capital, Mom's dental work, Dad's back surgery, $57,000 over five years, all because I thought I was being a good daughter. Every family gathering they praise me for being so generous. Behind my back, they were laughing at how easy I was to manipulate. I got In my car and drove straight to the bank. I'd like to close all my accounts, I told the teller. All of them, miss every single one. And I need cashiers checks for the full amounts, documentation of every transaction I've made to these three people over the past five years. That evening, Landon called right on schedule. Hey, sis, can you come over tomorrow? Mom has some news about her health. His voice had that practiced concern, the same tone he'd used for every fake emergency. Sure, I said sweetly. I'll bring the whole family something special. I spent that night making copies of everything, bank statements, medical records I'd helped pay for, receipts from Landon's failed ventures, five years of financial manipulation, all documented. The next day I walked into.

And suddenly this wasn't funny anymore. It was summer from my English class, a pregnant senior who everyone whispered about but nobody really talked to. She was sitting on the toilet, gripping the handicap rail with white knuckles, and her face was covered in sweat. What's wrong? I asked, even though I was starting to guess. Please do something. I'm giving birth. She looked up at me with pure terror in her eyes. My whole body went cold. I was 17 and barely knew how tampons worked, let alone babies. But she was crying and alone, and I couldn't just leave her there. I hopped over the stall divider awkwardly and almost slipped on the wet floor. That's when I saw it. The baby was already crowning. There was blood on the toilet seat and the floor, and summer was making the low groaning sounds that scared me more than anything. This was actually happening in a gross school bathroom with fluorescent lights and graffiti on the walls. I'll be right back. I ran out of the bathroom. Still in shock. I sprinted down the hallway to Missus Bashar's classroom. She was my favourite teacher and The only adult I could think of who wouldn't freak out, I burst through her door, interrupting her lecture on photosynthesis. The whole class stared at me. I need your help urgently, please. I was out of breath and probably looked insane. Missus Bashar took one look at my face and followed me without asking questions. We ran back to the bathroom and I could hear summer sounds getting louder. Other kids were starting to peek out of classrooms wondering what was happening. Missus Bashar pushed open the stall door and immediately went into teacher mode. Okay, honey, I'm here. You're doing great. I'm going to support you while she gets the nurse. I didn't need to be told twice. I ran to the nurse's office faster than I'd ever run in PE. When I burst through the door, Nurse Patty was checking Casey's temperature. Casey, who everyone knew was Summer's boyfriend, the guy who'd been bragging about becoming a dad at prom. Summer's having her baby in the bathroom right now. I basically screamed it. Casey's face went from white to green. He threw up all over the floor before Nurse Patty could grab a trash can. But we didn't have time to deal with that. The three of us ran back to the bathroom with nurse Patty grabbing emergency supplies from her cabinet. By now, half the school had heard something was happening. Kids were crowding outside the bathroom door trying to figure out what all the screaming Was about teachers were trying to move them back to class, but nobody was listening. When we got back to the stall, it was chaos. Missus Bashar was holding Summer's hand while she pushed. The nurse immediately took over, checking how dilated she was and telling summer to breathe. Casey stood frozen in the doorway looking like he might pass out. That's when summer grabbed my hand and pulled me close. You have to get.

I care about my teenage boy, but I'd be dishonest if I said I wasn't let down by the kind of person he's becoming. My son began getting into this different look back when he was in middle school. At first, he just wore black clothes. But once he got to high school, he's gone way too far with his strange style and I really don't like it. My wife doesn't seem to mind, but she's a pretty passive woman and has never been a very strict parent like me. If I were to describe how my son dresses now, he wears big, baggy black clothing and lots of chains and rings. At one point, he was even dying coloured strips into his hair. I remember being so upset the first day I saw this. It was just so embarrassing to see my child walking around like that. Now, I don't have a problem with gay people or anything like that, but I never really wanted that type of thing to be a part of my own household. I've never confronted my son about his sexuality, and I really just don't wanna know. If he does happen to be gay, our relationship is already sort of strained. And I feel like if I found out he wasn't straight, it would make it very hard for me to treat him the same like I Said I don't have a problem with gay people. I just don't wanna be shoved in my face on top of everything. Ever since my son entered high school, he's made friends with mostly girls. At first I was glad to see this and I was happy that my son still might have a chance of growing up into a real man's man. But as time went on, I realised that he wasn't in a relationship with any of these girls dad. They were all just his close friends. He constantly has his friends over the house and is part of a friend group with 3 other girls. To be fair, these girls have always been nothing but polite to me and my wife and are always respectful of our house. Still, it just rubs me the wrong way that my son doesn't seem to have any close guy friends and I feel like it's not good for him to grow up that way. I tried my best to be non judgmental towards my son, even though to me he looked like more of a freak of nature every day the more he kept leaning into his alternative fashion. I didn't understand it since all of his friends were normal girls, he was the only weirdo in his friend group who dressed like some 90s mall rat. When I look at him, he honestly reminds me of the kind of kids I would pick on in high school anyway about A year ago, I ran out of patience with him when he came home one day with his nails painted a shade of bright blue. My son had never done anything like this before and I couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly disgusted. I told him that he had gone too far with his emo bullshit and that I couldn't continue letting him make a fool out of himself like this. I told him that at one point he needed to become a man and painting his nails made him look like some sort of weak top. My son and I had never really been close. We didn't even speak that often. So he looked very hurt as I was telling him all this. But I couldn't help it. He had needed a reality check for so long and there was no avoiding this conversation. I told my son to go get nail polish remover and remove his nail polish right there in front of me. That's when he started to get angry and said that he didn't have to change himself just to appease my dumb, a homophobic son. My son has never spoken to either of his parents this way and I knew that there was no way I was letting him get away with it. I yelled at him for cursing at me like that and I told him that he would remove his nail polish immediately or there would be serious consequences. He said that there was Nothing worse I could do to him than continue being such a hateful father. And that's when I lost my shot. I told him that I would ground him for the entire year if he didn't remove his nail polish. Within the next 60 seconds, looked at me and told me that I could try, but I would never be able to control him and that he hated me. He ran up to his room after this and I followed through on my threat. I took his phone away and replaced it with a flip phone and he wasn't allowed to go out or have his friends over anymore. All he did after that for the rest of the year was call his friends in his room and completely ignore me. One night I overheard him crying to my wife about how much he hated his life since being grounded. But all she said was that I was his father and he needed to respect me. Proud of my wife for sticking up to me behind closed doors. And I still felt like I had made the right decision. I won't lie and say that it hasn't been a difficult year. My son stopped talking to me the day I grounded him and I honestly do miss him. He graduates next year and I just hope before then he'll realise that I was only ever trying to do what was best for him.

I need extra hands. Yeah, I don't think so. I wasn't about to climb into a bathroom stall with a freak. No, please. I think I might bleed out. Her voice was shaking, and suddenly this wasn't funny anymore. It was summer from my English class, a pregnant senior who everyone whispered about, but nobody really talked to. She was sitting on the toilet, gripping the handicap rail with white knuckles, and her face was covered in sweat. What's wrong? I asked, even though I was starting to guess. Please do something. I'm giving birth. She looked up at me with pure terror in her eyes. My whole body went cold. I was 17 and barely knew how tampons worked, let alone babies. But she was crying and alone, and I couldn't just leave her there. I hopped over the stall divider awkwardly and almost slipped on the wet floor. That's when I saw it. The baby was already crowning. There was blood on the toilet seat and the floor, and summer was making the low groaning sounds that scared me more than anything. This was actually happening in a gross school bathroom with fluorescent lights and graffiti on the walls. I'll be right back. I ran out of the bathroom, still in shock. I sprinted down the hallway to missus Bashar's classroom. She was my favourite teacher and The only adult I could think of who wouldn't freak out.

So I decided to make them both pay for their betrayal. I found out on a Tuesday. Sophie called in tears, voice shaking so hard I thought someone had died. She sat in her car outside our house, gripping the steering wheel like she was about to crash it. I'm pregnant, she said. For three seconds, I smiled. We've been talking about kids for months. And she added, it might not be yours. Silence. The air around me turned thick. My throat burned. Who? I asked. But I already knew. Her eyes darted away. It wasn't supposed to. Tell me. It's not Alex. The sound she made wasn't even a word. That was all the answer I needed. I staggered out of the car, knees barely working. She chased me, babbling excuses. Late nights. One mistake. She never meant to hurt me. My ears roared. Three months. Four. She swallowed, nodded. I drove straight to the office. My. My brother was there, smug as ever, wearing new Cologne like a cheap disguise. When he saw my face, he knew. Listen, bro, I can explain. My fist landed before the sentence finished. Blood shot from his nose. The room filled with the metallic smell of it, sharp and sour. Dad and two employees pulled me off. Alex shrieked like a coward. She came on to me. We're in love. Those words echoed in the Walls like poison. Mom pressed her hands to her mouth. Janet, our receptionist for 15 years, grabbed her purse and walked out without a word. That silence said more than anything. Dad raised his hands like a judge calling order. His voice was heavy but calm in that fake way he always used when he thought he was the only adult in the room. We'll handle this like adults. Alex spat blood onto the floor, then grinned through it. Teeth red. She's having my baby. You can't ignore that. The room spun. I looked at dad, he looked at Alex, then at me. We'll figure this out. Family is family. I left a week later.

But Karma served him something he couldn't swallow. Carlos showed up at Rose's Cantina in February with his restaurant management certificate, and right away he started changing everything we've been doing for years. He walked around with a smug attitude, telling everyone the kitchen was disorganized and that we needed to follow modern systems instead of the old ways. After two months of his nonsense, he called me into the main dining room while the whole lunch crew was watching. Miguel, we need to make some changes around here, he announced loud enough for everyone to hear. You refused to follow corporate procedures, so I'm letting you go. You're done. Clear out your things. I've been the head cook at roses for 12 years, and I knew every single regular customer by name and exactly how they like their food. But I just nodded quietly and went to get my stuff. The waitresses all stood there frozen. And Elena, who'd been there almost as long as he, had tears running down her face. As I was walking out with my things, I stopped and said over my shoulder, hope the weekend breakfast rush goes smooth for you. Carlos just waved his hand like it didn't matter. Any trained cook can handle eggs and beans, smiled to myself, Mother's Day weekend is coming up. Should be interesting. His confident expression flickered for just a second. What about Mother's Day? Oh, Nothing special, I said, heading for the door. Just our busiest three days of the year. All the families come in with their special orders. You'll be fine. What Carlos didn't know was that Mother's Day weekend at roses was like the Super Bowl for us. Families would pack the place from Friday through Sunday and every single regular family had their own special way they wanted their breakfast. I've been preparing special seasoned meats for weeks that customers have been asking about, marinating them just right with my own blend of spices I perfected over the years. Carlos had never bothered to learn any of this stuff because he was too busy talking about portion control and standardized recipes. Our customers were families who'd been coming for generations and wanted their food exactly how they remembered it from when their parents brought them as kids. Saturday morning came and at 6:00am sharp, my phone started going off. I ignored it and made myself some coffee. By 6:45, Carlos had called eight times. At 7:15, Elena texted me.

She suddenly became a food critic. My girlfriend insisted I cook for her roommate's birthday dinner at our apartment. I been planning the menu all week, but she kept reminding me not to go overboard with the fancy stuff, because Lexi preferred simple food. The second I started prepping in the kitchen, setting up my knees on place and heating the cast iron, my girlfriend grabbed her phone and sprawled on the couch. I'm ordering sushi for myself, she announced without looking up. Your food's always too heavy. I watched her scroll through TikTok while I worked on the carbonara from scratch, making fresh pasta and whisking eggs with Eccarino Romano. Smells incredible in here, said a voice from the doorway. Lexi had come home early from work, dark hair pulled back, still in her office clothes, the type who actually appreciated effort when she saw it. Oh, my god, she said, moving closer to the stove. Are you making pasta from scratch? She actually watched me work, not the polite glance people usually give. I didn't know guys our age even knew how to cook like this. My ex could barely make cereal. We started talking about food while I finished the dish. She traveled through Italy last summer. Rome, Florence, Bologna. Real interest, asking about techniques and ingredients. Have you always cooked like this? Lexi asked, leaning against the counter. I'd love to learn Sometime. Your girlfriend is so lucky. My chest tightened. My girlfriend had never once asked to learn anything I made. Not once in two years of dating. I'd even catered her office party last month and she'd introduce the food as something we picked up. Does she eat my food? I asked. Lexi's expression shifted slightly. Well, she mentioned you cook a lot. She paused. Actually, now that I think about it, I've never seen her eat anything you've made. She's always getting take out when we hang out. That hit harder than expected. I cooked five nights a week and ate most meals alone. Lexi must have seen something in my face because she stepped closer. That's her loss. This looks restaurant quality. It's nothing special, I said, plating the carbonara from the living room. I caught my girlfriend glancing over while pretending to watch Netflix.

Lexi noticed, too, and smiled. Well, well, looks like someone finally noticed you exist. My girlfriend looked away, quickly turning the volume up on the TV. You know what, Lexi said, taking a bite of the pasta, her eyes literally closed. This is the best thing I've eaten in months. She looked directly at my girlfriend. Girl, if you don't marry him, I will. This is insane. She took another bite, then raised her voice just enough to carry. Seriously, I would wife you up just for this carbonara alone. Do you cater? Because I have single friends who would pay good money to date a guy who cooks like this. The effect was instantaneous. My girlfriend appeared in the kitchen faster than I'd ever seen her move. Her face flushed red. Since when are you two so friendly, she demanded, positioning herself between Lexi and me. Lexi shrugged with practiced innocence. Since I discovered what I've been missing, your boyfriend's a literal chef and you're ordering sushi. My girlfriend grabbed a fork like she was claiming territory. I eat his food all the time. Actually. She took a massive bite of the carbonara, overacting like she was in a commercial. Babe, this is amazing. Why didn't you tell me you were making this? I did tell you three times. You said it was too heavy. I said, no, I meant the sushi was too heavy, she said quickly, already pulling Me away from Lexi. Can we talk now? Lexi watched us with amusement. I'll just be here eating this incredible meal that someone cooked with actual skill and love that any smart woman would appreciate. My girlfriend practically dragged me to our bedroom. How long has Lexi been flirting with you? She hissed, closing the door. I said she wasn't. She just really enjoyed my cooking. He's been coming on to you this whole time. How would you know? I said you haven't looked up from your phone during a meal in months. That's not true. I Instagram your food all the time. No. You Instagram restaurant food. Name one dish I've made that you've actually tried. Her mouth opened, closed. The. The chicken thing. I've never made a chicken thing. I've been vegetarian for three years. The silence that followed was deafening. She stared at me like she was seeing me for the first time. Lexi's right, isn't she? She finally whispered. I don't even know you. I turned back toward the kitchen where someone actually wanted to share a meal with me. No, I said, you never bothered to try.

When I was 17, my mom forced me to start babysitting, but I had no idea who I was doing it for. When I met this woman, I couldn't believe how overprotective she was. She had cameras in every room of the house and asked me to call her every half hour just to make sure her daughter was okay. She told me I wasn't allowed to do anything except watch her. And when she finally left, I basically just sat there for three hours doing nothing until she came home. She came back and basically ran into the room to make sure the girl was okay and I assured her everything was fine. I had long hair at the time and had put it up at this point. And should probably now mention I have severe hearing loss. I have to wear hearing aids, which can usually be easily mistaken for headphones. Then as I was standing up to say bye to the girl, her mom noticed them in my ears. She thought I was wearing headphones the whole time and wasn't paying attention to the little girl. This made her furious and a second later, I felt her grab my head. All I remember was feeling the worst pain I've ever felt in my ear. I turned around to see her holding my hearing aid and realized what she did. She thought I was listening to music. She ripped my hearing aid. Out of my ear, thinking it was a headphone. And since they connect directly to my eardrum, she completely ripped that out, too. The pain was so intense I passed out and woke up in the hospital to my mom crying. She was livid. And even though they begged us not to, we sued her. I will never hear out of my ear again, but I'll never have to work again either.

The teacher laughed uncomfortably. I just smiled. A month later, she was explaining custody papers. My wife, Jessica, is a corporate lawyer who went to Ivy League for 12 years. She never let me forget it. In her mind, I wasn't her partner. I was her pet project, the working class husband she could mock to show how superior she was. The jokes were constant. At dinner parties, it's so cute how excited he gets about playing with his tools. She'd correct my grammar like I was a child. But the worst part was what she was doing to our 10 year old son Leo. She was teaching him to see me as incompetent. He'd ask for help with math. She'd sigh, why don't you wait for me, honey? Daddy gets confused with big numbers. I tried fighting it, but every argument ended with silent treatment until I gave up. I stayed trapped because I was terrified she'd use her money and legal connections to take my son if I left. The breaking point came at Leo's parent teacher conference. He was struggling with science and missus Davidson suggested parents help with a home project. That's when Jessica delivered the line that ended our marriage. She let out that condescending laugh and told the teacher, well, I'll be handling that. He tries to help with homework, but honestly He's dumber than the kids. Mrs. Davidson's smile froze. She laughed uncomfortably, but I saw the pity in her eyes. In that moment, my wife had declared me an unfit father in front of my son's teacher. I did react. I just smiled quietly and sat through the meeting. But something inside me died and was replaced by cold resolve. I wasn't just leaving her. I was taking my son with me. Using her own cruelty to do, I hired Marcus Thorne, the most aggressive family attorney in the city. I drained my savings to pay his retainer. He was blunt. Judges hate parental alienation, but you need proof, hard, undeniable proof. So I became a spy in my own home. I bought voice recorders and placed them in the kitchen, living room and Leo's playroom. It was legal since I was part of the conversations in my own home. The evidence I gathered was sickening. A kitchen recording where Leo asked about his history project. I started explaining and she cut me off. Leo, don't listen to him. He probably thinks dinosaurs are still alive. Let's look it up on a real website after your dad is done helping. A living room recording during a documentary, I commented on a scientific principle and she laughed. Did you learn that from one of your tool catalogues, Paul? It's cute that you try. The worst was her phone call with her sister. I don't know how much longer I can take It it's like having two children. I swear Leo is already smarter than he is. My only hope is that the it inherited my jeans. While gathering evidence, I launched Operation Superdad. I took over Leo's schooling and activities for his science project, the thing she'd mocked me over. I took him to my workshop. We spent three weekends building a solar system from scratch using scrap metal, ball bearings and a motor. We welded, painted and figured out gear ratios to make planets orbit at different speed. Leo was captivated learning mechanics and engineering while seeing his dumb dad in a new light. He got the highest grade in his class. Mrs. Davidson emailed saying it was the most impressive project she'd seen in 15 years. I documented everything every insult with time stamps and audio files every hour helping Leo, every school event I attended and everyone she missed for work the fuck final piece was financial discovery. While I've been putting my income into joint accounts for bills and Leo's expenses, she'd been diverting her salary into a secret investment portfolio, hidden money while planning to take mine.

So I'm in my 50s, and I bought this house in the Bay Area, like, 30 years ago for $230,000. Back then, nobody wanted to live here. Now it's worth over a million because of all the tech people moving in. I got insanely lucky with the timing. My daughter Camilla is 23. She grew up in this house. Every room has a memory. Her height marks are still on the kitchen door frame. She moved out last year to live with her boyfriend, but, like, obviously the house was always going to be hers someday. We never sat down and had some formal conversation about it, but come on, she's my only kid. Who else would get it? Here's the thing about my neighborhood. Now there's only two houses left that aren't owned by people making six figures in tech. Mine and my neighbor Jim, who bought around the same time I did. Everyone else, software engineers, people who work at Google. Camilla works as a hair stylist. She loves her job, but let's be real, she can't afford to buy anything here. Without this house, she'd have to move, like, two hours away just to afford rent. Two years ago, I met Steven. He's great. He has two kids from his previous marriage, both in elementary school. And I actually love those kids. I was excited about becoming a stepmom to them. We started talking about getting Married and combining our lives completely. Steven brought up finances and I agreed we should merge everything. But I told him I wanted a prenup specifically for the house. The house goes to Camilla no matter what. Non negotiable. He got quiet. Then he said he thought a million dollars split three ways between all the kids would be fair. Give everyone like 300,000 each to start their lives. I said, no. I paid 80% of that mortgage by myself over 30 years. Camilla is my daughter. This is her inheritance. With this house, she can keep working as a hair stylist and actually live in the area she grew up in. Without it, she's priced out of her own home. Steven said I was being unfair to his kids. Camilla was getting a massive advantage and his children would get nothing from me. I reminded him that I've known his kids for two years. I've known Camilla for 23 years. I carried her, I raised her alone. The house is hers. He said, if we're really becoming a family, then all the kids should be treated equally. I said, they are being treated equally in every other way. But this house is Camilla's. It always has been. We fought about it for weeks. I kept saying, 300,000 each is still life changing money. I kept saying, Camilla loses her ability to live in her own hometown if we do that. She'd have to move somewhere cheaper and start over. I finally called Camilla and asked her directly what she thought. She said she'd always assumed the house was hers. She'd been planning her future around it. She wants to stay in the area, maybe open her own salon someday. And she can only do that if she has the house. Steven overheard that conversation. He got mad and said Camilla was being selfish. I told him to stop. This is between me and my daughter. He said, if I go through with the prenup, then maybe we shouldn't get married at all. I said, then maybe we shouldn't. I told Steven the prenup happens or the wedding doesn't. He moved out last week. He took his kids stuff from my house and said I made my choice.

I spent my teenage years watching Ulyssa destroy cars while I begged for rides to work. On her 16th birthday, our parents surprised her with a brand new white BMW wrapped in a giant red bow. I stood there in the driveway, 17 years old, holding my bus pass. So when's my turn? I asked. Mom didn't even look at me. Andrea, you know you're not ready for that kind of responsibility. You still haven't proven yourself since you broke that lamp when you were 12. Look how well you Lisa takes care of her things. You Lisa dangled the keys in front of me. Yeah, maybe when you stop being such a mess. I had to take a bus everywhere I went that summer. And it didn't help that you Lisa would drive by the bus stop just to yell, hey, Andrea! Still taking the bus like a middle schooler. Her friends would laugh. Once, during a thunderstorm, she literally drove through a puddle to soak me. I got written up for showing up late and dripping wet. My manager said I should have left earlier to account for weather. After three months, I had $2,000 saved. I showed my parents the bank statement. Could you maybe match this? Like a really old Toyota or something? Dad barely glanced at it. That's college money, not car money. You're being short sighted. Five days later, Ulyssa crashed The BMW into our own mailbox. Checking Instagram. Parents had it fixed by the weekend. Few months after that, she rear ended an old lady at a red light. Everyone makes mistakes, mom said. Writing another check. That's how we learn. Meanwhile, I was catching three buses to get to community college, up at 4:00am for an 8:00am class. Ulyssa would always text, sorry you're still stuck with public transportation. Maybe show them.

Ulyssa would always text, sorry, you're still stuck with public transportation. Maybe show them you can handle. Nice thing I finally bought a car for 18 dollars. It was held together with duct tape and prayers, but it was mine. The engine knocked, the AC didn't work, and it leaked oil everywhere. Ulyssa called it the homeless mobile. I started watching YouTube videos at night, learning how to fix engines. First I changed the oil myself, then the brake pads. Within 6 months, I rebuilt the entire engine in our driveway, while ulyssa complained my tools were ugly and lowering property values. But my car ran perfectly. And I loved working on cars so much that I started fixing my friends cars for cash. Twenty bucks for an oil change, fifty for brakes. My phone wouldn't stop buzzing with requests. Of course, Ulyssa hadn't changed one bit. She got her third car after totaling the BMW completely. A Mercedes this time. I'm just not good with maintenance, she'd say. While our parents paid for everything, I rented a garage space and opened a small shop. Words spread fast about the girl who could fix any. By 25, I owned three shops and had 12 employees. I collected classic cars as a hobby, restoring them in my free time. Yulisa still lived at home. At 28, her Mercedes repossessed after our parents finally cut her off. She bounced between retail jobs, getting fired for calling in sick to go shopping. Last month, yulisa showed up at my house. She never comes here. She stood at my door with this weird smile, looking at my drive.

She kept touching my arm, complimenting everything. My couch, my kitchen, even my doormat. I crossed my arms. What do you want, Ulyssa? Her fake smile got bigger. Can't I just visit my successful sister? She walked toward the garage, peeking through the window. Wow. And cars. That's amazing. You know, I was thinking, you have so many, and I have none. You should give me one. Like today. I actually laughed. Give you one? Exactly. The Tesla would be perfect. Or the Porsche. You have seven. You won't even miss it. Ulyssa, those cars cost more than you've made in your entire life. So? Oh, family helps family. Like how you helped me when I was taking three buses to school. Her face went red. She pulled out her phone and called mom, putting it on speaker. Mom, I'm at Andrea's. He has seven cars and won't give me even one. Mom's voice filled my garage. Andrea, is that true? I worked for them. Mom, she's your sister, and she needs help. Give one to her. The audacity! She's too irresponsible for my nice cars. Ulyssa grabbed the phone. She's being cruel. That's exactly what you all said to me, remember? I needed to learn responsibility first. The silence. Stretched, Ulyssa's mouth flung open. Mom finally spoke. It's different, Andrea. How? They couldn't answer. You know what? Actually, I'll help you. About time. Her eyes on the Porsche. I'll text you the bus schedule. Line 12 runs every hour. She stormed out and took a bus home.

And even though you were happy when you ordered the cake, you became sad when he said that thing about your dress being tight if you eat it. Max's face was getting red. Listen, kid. Adult relationships are complicated, and he asked me to help her with her diet. Winnie nodded quickly. He's right, sweetie. I want to look good for summer. But her hand was shaking as she reached for her water. My mom looks good all the time, Ali said. Dad says so when she eats ice cream. He never says she can't have food. Winnie's smile faltered. That's sweet, but every relationship is different. The older woman behind us turned around. Honey, how long Have you been together? Winnie brightened. Two years. Max has been so patient, helping me improve myself. Max jumped in. Winnie's lost 15 pounds since we met. She looks amazing now. And she's actually happy. Winnie's face did something complicated. I was happy before, too. I saw Max squeezed her hand like a warning. Of course, babe, but.

So why did he beg for me to stop? My fiance? Lancer, waited until I was addressing our wedding invitations to tell me. I want us to have an entire hall pass month before the wedding. What? I asked because the shock was too much for me to process. A month of freedom. Both of us see other people before we commit forever. He said it like it was normal, like he was just asking to change dinner plans. This is insane. I told him. Didn't you just have your bachelor party in Vegas? His face changed, and that told me that something had obviously changed in Vegas. That was different. That was just guys being guy eyes. He leaned forward. Sarah, I'm being honest here. No questions asked for either of us. Complete freedom. Then we get married with no regrets. So are you in? I looked at the wedding invitations with our names in gold lettering and felt my heart break into a million pieces. Fine, I said. Let's both be free. Lancer smiled like he just won something. The first night of our Freedom Month, he spent two hours getting ready for a date. He even work alone. I'd never or smelled before. As soon as he left, I spent an hour crying about what could have been. And then I decided to make the most of it. So I sent a text to Windsor, Lancer's best friend. To my surprise, he replied within a minute, asking, can we talk? I have something to tell you. My hands were shaking when I typed back. We can have coffee tomorrow. Windsor looked sick when he sat down, wouldn't stop stirring his coffee. Vegas was bad, he said, staring at the table. My chest felt tight. Lancer took me to the treasures. He bought a private room. And there was this girl named Whitney.

You weren't even mad, present Ava observed. I was already in love with you, I admitted. Me? Exactly 43 seconds, our first date unfolded. Above us. Ava, on screen, was trying sushi for the first time, making faces. You hate sushi, present Ava said suddenly. But you took me anyway. I nodded, watched you eat California rolls for two hours. Worth every second. She turned To look at me for the first time. You really love me that much? From the begin, I nodded. The vacation photos made her laugh. Oh god, I got food poisoning.

Ava opened her eyes in the hospital bed after the car accident and smiled at me drowsily. But then she looked confused. Then fear overtook her. Why are you in my room? I reached for her hand, but she jerked away. Ava, I'm Silas, your husband. She shook her head violently. I'm not married. I'd remember being married. I held up my left hand, showing the ring she'd slipped on five years ago while crying happy tears. We've been together seven years, married for five. Her eyes went wide with panic. You're lying! This is insane! The doctors explained the amnesia while Ava stared at her own wedding ring like it might bite her. For three days, I watched my wife treat me like a well meaning stranger. She was polite, but kept her distance. Her parents showed her our wedding album. You were so happy, her mother kept saying. Ava studied the photos clinically. She looks happy, she'd say. Like a bride with someone else entirely. At night, I'd go set up a planetarium. The place where we first fell in love. I arranged hundreds of photos and videos of her life before the accident, our life together. I truly believed that if she fell in love with me once, she could do it again. The drive to the planetarium felt like heading to my own execution. Ava sat pressed against the passenger door. Can you at least tell me why we're going to a planetarium? She asked.

He made this kid who always ate alone feel included by creating a whole bit about how sitting alone was actually the VIP section of the cafeteria. During junior year, when everyone was stressed about college stuff, Nick started a daily joke segment during morning announcements called Bad Joke Wednesday. Even though he did it every day of the week, the principal tried to shut it down, but the whole school complained so much they had to bring it back. The talent show was supposed to be Nick's big night cause everyone knew he'd been working on something epic for months. The auditorium was so packed that people were standing in the back just to watch. Nick grabbed the mic and started his bit about how our School Spirit Week theme things were getting so weird that next year we probably have dressed like your parents biggest disappointment day, and then paused and said, wait, that's just every day for me. Everyone was losing it and filming everything when Nick suddenly just went completely quiet. He stood there holding the mic and stare staring at something in the crowd for the longest time. Then he set the mic down on the stage floor super carefully and walked straight off the stage and out the side door without saying anything. The whole place went silent because nobody knew if this was part of the show or not. People started looking around and whispering Trying to figure out what was happening, the drama teacher ran on stage, saying Nick wasn't feeling good. But you could tell she was just as confused as everyone else. Nobody saw Nick for three days. And when he came back to school, he was completely different. He wouldn't joke around or even smile at anyone. Then the real story started going around about what actually happened that night. Nick's best friends

They're facing foreclosure. Zero retirement savings. They spent everything. New cars every few years, vacations. All funding Spencer's failed business ventures. The bank sent the final notice two months ago. We need your help, dad says on speaker phone. You owe us. We raised you. I let the silence hang for a moment. We need a place to live. Mom continues. I was looking at your property listings online. That penthouse in your Riverside building is perfect. You can just let us live there. Family helps family. I laughed. There are current tenants. Just a victim. Dad interrupts. Blood is thicker than water. Surely they'll understand. But here's where it gets interesting. Actually, I can offer you something. I say. I have a unit available in one of my other build things. 4th floor, 1 bedroom. $1,800 per month. First month, last month, security deposit, standard lease terms. The line goes so quiet, I think they hung up. You're charging us rent? Mom finally gasps. You charge me rent at 16? I reply. While Spencer lived free. I'm just teaching you responsibility. Isn't that what you taught Me? That was different. Dad shouts you were learning to be an adult, and now you're learning the consequences. $1,800, take it or leave it. Let me know by Friday. My mom's voice cracks but you're our son. I was never your son. I was your tenant. So now you can be mine.

What's going on? Mom turned, hands shaking. She admitted it, Martin. She framed Kyle. Dad looked at Becca. Is that true? Her voice came out like venom. So what if I did? You always expected me to be perfect. I made sure he was the one you gave up on. Mom staggered back. Tears streamed down her face. Dad's jaw tightened. You ruined your brother's life. You threw me out. I said you believed her. Now it's too late. I stepped forward, blood streaking my arm. You're going to fix this. Clear my name publicly. Publicly? Facebook, church page, family group chat. Tell everyone the truth. Mom pulled out her phone, trembling. Tell me what to write. We owe everyone an apology. Our son Kyle was wrongly accused. Our daughter, Becca, planted money and we believed her. We failed as parents and are asking for forgiveness. Mom typed. She hit post. Within minutes, comments poured in. Becca snapped. You just ruined my life. Dad rounded on her. You ruined your own life. I walked toward the porch. I'm taking back my bed. You owe me. Now you're going to feed me, give me a roof, and live with what you did. Nobody argued. I marched upstairs. For the first time in weeks, I was sleeping in a bed. Not because they allowed it, because I demanded it.

My GPA stays at 3.8 because I need scholarships. Every two weeks I hand over $300. While Spencer gets his third car after totaling the last one. He needs reliable transportation. Dad's as signing the loan papers. I ride my bike to work in the rain. When I ask for help buying a graphing calculator for AP Calculus, mom size we just help Spencer with his car payment. Can't you borrow one? I buy a used one off Craigslist for $30. I get accepted to a state university with a partial scholarship. I need my parents to co sign student loans for the rest.

Maybe the bank made a mistake. But I knew. I grabbed her phone and logged into her banking app and scrolled through the transactions. Sports betting sites, hotel rooms in Vegas, bars charging 400 bucks at once. All of it had Ethan's card linked to her account. I felt sick. I screenshotted everything, printed it at her house. And we waited for him to show up that evening, like he'd been doing when he walked in with his stupid flowers. Mom asked him straight up if he took her money. And he didn't even lie. He didn't even pretend. He just shrugged and said, yeah, he'd been using it. Then he looked at her dying in her own bed, and Said you were gonna die anyway. At least I got to actually enjoy it. I've never seen my mom's face do that before. It was like watching her heartbreak in real time. She told him to get out. He laughed and said she'd forgive him by next week, like she always did. But she didn't. She told me to change every password, every login, everything. I called the police that same night. Mom didn't want to press charges. She said she couldn't send her own son to jail, even after what he did. But she called her lawyer the next morning and removed him from her will completely. Every single thing went to me. She made sure it was airtight so he couldn't contest it.

He dropped out of college after one semester because he said lectures were boring. Got fired from target for showing up high. I owe 200 bucks from mom for rent and spent it on concert tickets.

Meanwhile, I was working double shifts as a nurse, paying my own bills, and showing up every Thursday to take mom grocery shopping. I'd help her sort pills, drive her to doctor appointments, sit with her when she felt lonely. Ethan would text maybe once a month asking if she could Venmo him gas money. Then mom got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, age 4. The doctor said maybe six months of treatment went well. I took family leave from work to be there for her chemo appointments, and suddenly, out of nowhere, Ethan started showing up. Like, actually showing up. He'd come over with flowers from the grocery store. He'd sit with her and watch her old cooking shows.

I was sitting across from Larkin on our five year anniversary when he took out a velvet box and tossed it across the table. Look, I'm down to get married, but I need freedom to explore. There's so many beautiful women out there, he continued, and I need to experience them before I die. I stared at the Rolex on his wrist, his Gucci belt, all paid for by me while he got his shit together. Here's what Lorcan didn't know. I'd spent our entire relationship lying to him. See, Lorcan was, like, medium ugly at best, and he has a micro P P. Yes, you heard me right. 0.5 inches. But my love language is words of affirmation. So I spent five years telling him size doesn't matter. Made him feel like he was incredible when he really, really wasn't. And now he actually believed it. You know what? You're absolutely right, I said. His head snapped up. See? This is why I love you. You get it? He reached across and squeezed my hand, already looking at a woman walking past our table. This is going to be amazing for us. I smiled back. He had no idea what was coming. Within a week, Lorcan was a different person. New Cologne that he bought in five installments with. He'd sit on the couch next to me, swiping through dating apps, showing Me. Photos of women. This one wants to meet up Thursday, he'd say. You should try to. Oh, wait. You're probably too shy for this lifestyle. I just nodded because I had my eyes on a prize, too. after two weeks of Larkin posting other girls on his Instagram story, his mom finally texted me about the family barbecue. You'll still come, won't you? His brother Jack and I both want you there. I wouldn't miss it, I said, and I meant it. At the barbecue, Jack was at the grill in a shirt that he probably paid for by himself. He smiled when he saw me. That genuine smile that made you feel like you mattered. Hey, he said, I heard about the open relationship thing. You doing okay? I stepped closer. Actually, I'm doing great. Larkin wanted freedom. I'm just taking the same deal. His expression shifted. Oh, yeah? We talked for an hour, laughed. His hand brushed mine.

I dropped my duffel bag on the porch, confused. What do you mean? My deployment ended? She stumbled backward and grabbed the door frame. Daddy! My six year old son Tommy came running and wrapped himself around my legs. You're alive. You're alive! Mommy said you died. The words hit me like a punch. I looked at Ursula for an explanation, but she just stood there, frozen, tears streaming down her face. I need to sit down. Ursula's face crumpled. Tommy, please go to your room. But I want to tell daddy about now. I headed upstairs to check on him and passed our bedroom. Something told me to push the door open and my heart stopped. There was a man I didn't recognize in my bed. Who is that? My voice came out cold. She looked up with red, puffy eyes. His name is Steve. Then before I could say anything else, there were footsteps behind me. It was Steven. He saw me in my uniform and froze. Wait. You're alive? He turned to Ursula. Ursula, what the hell is going on? She wouldn't look at either of us. You showed me the obituary. I went to the funeral. That's when I realized he didn't know. How long have you been here? I asked him directly. Eight months. She called me in April. Said you'd been killed. Steven was pacing now. I quit my job. In Denver for this? I had a promotion coming up. Everything. You quit your job? Steven turned to face Ursula. You said Tommy needed stability, Steven said, looking at Ursula. I used my savings to pay for his therapy sessions. You said the military insurance wouldn't cover it. He pulled out his phone and showed me $6,000 in therapy payments over eight months. My eyes were fixed on the ring on her finger, one I didn't recognize. She told me we'd get married, Steven announced, following my gaze. After enough time passed, she said Tommy was already calling me dad, and it would help him. I turned to Ursula. He calls him dad. She was crying, but I didn't care anymore. My brother died in Iraq five years ago, Steven said. When Ursula told me you'd been killed and she needed help, I thought it was what he would have wanted.

My daughter in law called me Thursday night and I could hear her voice crack. Before she even said anything. She told me she couldn't make it to the spa weekend we paid for because my son decided his friend was in town and he wanted to hang out with them instead. Just like that, her birthday weekend gone. I already noticed she looked exhausted last time I visited. Three kids under four years old and she's doing everything alone. My son convinced her to quit her job and stay home by selling her this perfect picture of family life. What he didn't tell her was that when I stayed home with him, his dad and I split everything 50 50. After five, I got Sundays off, I got date nights twice a week. She gets nothing. So I pushed a little, asked how things really were. She broke down and told me everything. He doesn't help with the kids, doesn't do chores, doesn't take her out. Just sits there acting like she's supposed to handle three babies alone. Because that's what stay at home moms do. I was so angry I could barely think straight. I told her to drop the kids with me, bring a friend to the spa. And I gave her 500 euros from my savings to buy herself something nice. She cried and thanked me. Then I made her tell Me. Where my son was. Me! Five minutes of begging, but she finally said he was at Murphy's Bar downtown. The second she left for the spa, I grabbed my keys and drove straight there. Found him and his buddies in the back corner, laughing and drinking like he didn't have a care in the world. I sat down right next to their table. His friends went quiet first. Then he looked up and saw me. I said loud enough for the whole group to hear, did I fail you as a mother, or was it your father? Because we both thought you were supposed to put your partner first, not your drunk friends. His face went red immediately. One of his buddies mumbled something and got up to leave. I kept going. Told him his wife is home alone every single day with three kids while he's out here acting like he's still 20. Told him I didn't raise him to treat people like this. Told him his father would be ashamed. He tried to tell me to leave, said I was embarrassing him. I said, good. Maybe he should be embarrassed. The bartender came over and told me I needed to go. I told my son he better fix this or he'd lose everything. Then I left. Got banned from the bar on my way out.

Don't come to the reunion. Tom agrees. This is what's best for the family image. I'm a lawyer. They're cutting me out because I didn't marry rich like my brother Tom did. His wife Caroline comes from old money, and apparently I'm an embarrassment with my teacher boyfriend, Gabriel. The family reunion was supposed to be this big, fancy event at their Cape Cod house. Mom had been planning it for months, inviting all her high society friends. Three generations of Boston elite families. She kept saying the governor was coming, some Goldman Sachs executives, the whole nine yards. I wasn't good enough for their precious image. My teacher boyfriend wasn't impressive enough. Never mind that I graduated Harvard Law. Never mind that I work 80 hour weeks. Never mind that I've built my career from scratch. Mom married Caroline Bradford, whose family owns half of Back Bay. That made him the golden child. Me, I was just the disappointment who chose love over money. Here's what they didn't know, though. That merger I was presenting It was for Wilson Properties, my family's company. The one my dad built from nothing, but was about to lose everything because of bad investments.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight. Be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly, and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I. I turned onto our street, there was a black Infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walking up like he'd done it before. Becca opened. Before he could ring, they kissed. The kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too kind. I needed to do something else. Something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe. How was your night? Good. You know how it is. The next two Thursdays, I kept my routine, but park down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage, and that's when it hit me. The man was Mark. Mark, who supposedly moved to Seattle. Two years ago, my knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped the bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for Boys Night, when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Yeah, Mark was great. You guys still text, though, right? Sometimes. The next morning, she woke up different, with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors. And since it was Thursday, during lunch, she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew. The comment about Mark got her. Probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old. After work, she was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making

They investigated him instead. My ex husband, Joshua, had been building his case against me ever since the judge ordered him to pay child support. Joshua decided he wanted full custody so he wouldn't have to pay me a single cent. He bought a hidden camera to film our eight year old daughter, Tracy during his weekends, trying to catch her saying something bad about me so that he could use it as evidence. He even paid his cousin to break into my apartment and plant recording devices. I work as a nurse at the hospital and sometimes my shifts run late. So Joshua started documenting every single minute I was late picking her up. He'd also take photos during his custody weekends, but only the ones that looked terrible. A photo of Tracy making herself a sandwich became proof of child abandonment. Small bruise from playing soccer became proof of physical abuse. Kimberly is going down hard, he told his brother while showing him the folder of evidence. When I'm done with her, she will never see Tracy again. When the doorbell rang on a Tuesday morning, I knew something was wrong immediately. The night before, Joshua had sent me a text that said, enjoy your last day with her. He told me I should be grateful if the judge let me see Tracy at Christmas. Now Missus Hendricks from Child Protective Services stood at my door with Official paperwork. Joshua had actually gone through with his threat to destroy my life. Your ex husband filed an emergency report claiming that your daughter is in immediate danger, Missus Hendrick said, stepping inside. He claims you leave Tracy alone for entire nights while you party with men. The accusations got worse with every page she turned. He says you have been starving her and she has lost 15 pounds in two months. Another page flip showed photos Joshua had edited to make Tracy look skinnier. He claims Tracy told him she's terrified, terrified of you and begs not to go home. My hands were shaking because I knew Tracy would never say that. He even got three people to sign statements saying they've seen you driving drunk to school pickup. Missus Hendricks walked through my house checking everything while I scrambled to defend myself. I showed her the full refrigerator and freezer packed with Tracy's favorite foods. I pulled out medical records from Tracy's checkup two weeks ago,

When my wife was pregnant with our twin boys, the doctors somehow missed her pulmonary hypertension, a heart condition that kills 30% of mothers in labour. We didn't even know she had it till she gave birth 12 weeks early and ended up in a coma. Even worse, when our boys came out, they were blue in the face and needed the N I C U. Immediately for any chance of survival. But apparently the hospital couldn't put them in the N I C U. They needed insurance authorization from our providers before saving their lives. I told her that would take days, and my boys were literally purple. But the woman just sighed. I'm sorry, but rules are rules. Without authorization, we're talking about a 4 hundred thousand dollar Bill you'd be personally liable for, she said, not even looking at my twins. I could hear the heart monitors going crazy. Please, I begged, dropping to my knees. Look at them. Look at them! They're dying. She glanced over for half a second. Sir, getting emotional won't change protocol. I suggest you call your insurance company. I fumbled with my phone, hands shaking so bad I could barely dial. The insurance company put me on hold while my babies were turning darker blue. Twenty minutes of that cheerful hold music while I watched my son Lucas's heart rate drop from 180 to 140 to 110. The administrator, Mrs. Miles, was at Her desk, eating a sandwich. I ran over. Phone still on hold. Please, just start the treatment. I'll pay cash. I'll sell my house. I'll sign anything. Sir, even if you had $400,000 cash right now, we can't accept it without going through insurance first. It's fraud prevention protocol. She took another bite of her sandwich. A young nurse finally broke. Missus miles, those babies have maybe an hour. Jennifer, you're already on probation. One more word and you're fired. The nurse shut up, but she was sobbing. Other parents in the waiting room were recording on their phones. Horrified. One dad stood up and said, lady, what is wrong with you? Missus miles called security. I need these disruptive individuals removed from the admin area. I ran back to my boys. Ethan wasn't moving anymore.

Again? I stared in shock. Again? I don't want to compete. Oh, sweetie, mom said, reaching across the table to pat my hand. The monthly room assignment builds character. Winners get the master suite. Losers get the basement. My younger brother, Marvin, pushed his food around his plate. My sister Bianca, wouldn't even look up. We've been doing this for three months since we moved to this house. The basement had exposed pipes, no heat, and spiders that dropped from the ceiling at night. Bianca won last month with her debate trophy. Dad continued, pulling out his notebook. So she keeps the room unless one of you beats her achievements this month. The chicken tasted like cardboard in my mouth. This is insane. Other families don't do this. Mom's smile tightened. Other families raise weak children. We're raising winners. That night, Bianca came to my basement corner, where I'd hung sheets for privacy. I'm sorry, she whispered. I didn't want to win, but sleeping down here made me sick last time. It's not your fault, I said, but the words felt hollow. Marvin had already stopped talking to both of us. Next morning, dad posted the point chart on the refrigerator. 10 points for A's, 20 for sports victories, 15 for volunteer hours, even five points for who said good morning first. I watched Marvin set his alarm for four A M. Just to beat us to the kitchen. By week two, Bianca started hiding my homework. I found it crumpled in the trash after getting a zero. Marvin put a dead spider in my backpack during lunch, making me scream in front of everyone. We stopped eating together, stopped helping each other with assignments. Three kids living in the same house, acting like enemies. Look, get that competitive spirit! Dad beamed. One morning, after Marvin and Bianca physically fought over who got to take out the trash for points. Mom took photos like it was something to be proud of. My grades started slipping from the stress. I couldn't sleep in the freezing basement, constantly checking for spiders. Bianca developed anxiety.

She held up. A photo of my best friend Shane from college. You're imagining things. I.

Same exact cowlick, same ear shape, even the way they smile with just the left side going up first. My hands started shaking as memories began clicking into place like bullets into a chamber. That business trip Sylvia took five years and nine months ago, when Shane had coincidentally been at the same conference. The way Shane always brought Bennett the most expensive gifts. Showed up to every soccer game and every school play. I looked at my wife, hoping for denial and assurance that this wasn't real. Instead, I found her crying tears of guilt and clutching my arm while shaking her head. Bennett ran between us and looked at me with those green eyes. Shane's green eyes, not my brown ones. Daddy, why Is Mommy crying? He asked, and I realized with crushing clarity that I might not even have the right to that title. Sylvia, did you know about this whole time? The words came out flat, emotionless. Sylvia's hands were shaking. Read. I can explain. Explain what? I stood up so fast the chair crashed backward. You've been lying to me every single day for five years that my best friend is actually my son's father. It was just a mistake, Sylvia whispered, tears streaming. One mistake. One mistake!

I paused the T V. And laughed. No. Why did you? But Janelle didn't laugh back. I knew you were a selfish pig, she said, before walking out and locking her door from the inside. I honestly thought she was on her period or something. But when I walked into the kitchen, the entire room went silent. We can't believe you, Rhea announced. And he wouldn't even look at me. Can someone please tell me what's going on? I grabbed a chair, but Rhea pulled it away from me. You know exactly what you did. I was asleep like a normal person. You know I hate staying up late. It blinked back the tears because it felt like our years of friendship meant nothing anymore. That's when I saw I had 16 missed calls, all from my mom. She picked up on the first ring, but before I could say anything, she started sobbing. I thought I raised you better. You told me you promised you'd never do anything to hurt your future. Mom, what are you talking about? But she'd already hung up. She'd blocked me. Lindsay finally looked up, and her eyes were red, like she'd been crying. Samuel saw you. The whole basketball team saw you. My eyebrows furrowed. Samuel was my boyfriend of eight months. I went into our chat, and his contact photo disappeared. He blocked Me, too. Even your sister called me. Rhea said quietly. She wanted to know if you were okay, if you were on drugs or having some kind of breakdown. I told her, no, you're just a pick. Me? I left, making excuses about being late for class, not wanting them to see me cry. But when I got to campus, Doctor Rose was waiting outside the lecture hall. The dean wants to see you. Now. Her voice was cold, professional. Nothing like the professor who told me she believed in me. In the hallway, other students were pointing and whispering.

I spent my childhood digging through trash cans for the toys my brother Macky threw away. He always got everything new while I got his scraps. For Christmas, I had to watch Macky open a second new Tamagotchi in case the first one dies, while I was left with a dead one that had a screen so scratched you couldn't see the pet, even if it did somehow work. Even on my 10th birthday, when I begged for a Game Boy Advance, my family handed me Macky's old Game Boy color with a scratched that barely worked. It's too expensive, they said, only to buy Mackie a GBA a week later. I tried to complain about it, but my parents immediately shut me down saying, why waste money when your brother's old one works perfectly fine? And each time he gets something new I just find it in the trash a week later. It's for babies, he would tell me. But when I found his entire card collection in the trash can, thrown out and forgotten like how my parents pretty much did with me, I actually felt excited. It was like digging up treasure. I looked around and grabbed it, cleaned up his old premium binder and admired the restoration. Welcome to the family, I said. The cards! Before storing it away safely. After that, I fell in love with restoring and collecting everything Macky threw out. I kept things in their Cases so they wouldn't get dusty, made acrylic boxes for other toys, and even saved all my allowance just to buy a limited edition binder for the Pokemon cards. I. I joined a few online forum groups for toy collectors and picked up on how to restore the dead Tamagotchi and repair the screen. When it started working, I grinned and shared it online. Everyone applauded me, wishing their kids took care of their toys like me. And over the years I ended up making a lot of friends from these groups, all nerds and geeks who his rooms look like vintage museums. So when Mackey continued mocking me saying your room looks like you're 5, grow up already! It didn't even bother me anymore. Ten years later, the communities I joined became massively popular. The collection I started when I was just six ended up being worth more than a fancy full paid house. But I never sold any of it. Not even when my brother mocked me for having a room that deflected girls or when my parents shamed me for buying toys at my age. Ironically, my brother Mackie ended up having kids of his own that were obsessed with Pokemon cards just like he used to be. They wouldn't.

When I was 16, I lied on a job application and said I was 18 so I could clean these massive vacation houses in Aspen. My mom had died three months before from diabetes complications because we couldn't afford her insulin consistently. I was living with my aunt, who worked double shifts at a gas station just to keep our tiny apartment. These houses I cleaned were insane. Like bathrooms bigger than our entire place, with marble everything. And those fancy toilets that cost more than my aunt made in six months. I'd scrub these pristine kitchens that probably got used twice during their whole vacation. One Thursday afternoon, I was mopping the hallway in this ridiculous mansion when I heard screaming from upstairs. This 14 year old girl named Sienna was having a complete meltdown at her dad because he wouldn't buy her a second iPhone just for making TikToks. She already had the newest model, but apparently she needed a separate one for content creation. I tried to keep working, but then I heard her yell something that made my blood freeze. She screamed at her dad, if you're gonna be so annoying about money, why don't you just divorce mom and marry someone richer instead? I gripped that mop handle so tight, my knuckles went white. My mom had died on the same. Same couch I slept on every night. We'd eaten ramen For dinner, probably 300 days that year. Sienna stormed out of the room and saw me standing there in the hallway. She rolled her eyes and said, ugh, I hate when the help just stands around doing nothing. I wanted to say something, but I needed this job desperately, so I just kept mopping and pretended I didn't hear anything. Later, I was cleaning their kitchen when Sienna came in, talking to her friend on speaker phone. She was still ranting about the phone situation, saying stuff like, my

My Uncle Harold called me to his hospital bed three days before he died and handed me a thick envelope. Open this. At my funeral. During the eulogy, he wheezed that familiar mischief in his eyes. Promise me, Timothy, when your father starts talking about what a disappointment I was. I promised, though I should have known better. Harold was the family failure. Never married, no kids, lived in a trailer, worked odd jobs. My father and aunts constantly reminded him how he'd wasted his potential. Every family gathering ended with someone lecturing Harold about responsibility, while he just smiled and nodded. When he got cancer, they suddenly cared, hovering around his hospital bed, asking about his affairs and whether he'd made arrangements. The funeral was exactly what Harold predicted. My father stood at the podium, going on about missed opportunities and poor choices, barely disguising his contempt as grief. That's when I opened the envelope. Inside was a single page and a USB drive labeled Play Me Now. I walked to the funeral home's AV system and plugged it in. Harold appeared on screen, very much alive, sitting in his hospital bed, grinning. Hello, family. If you're watching this, William just finished explaining what a loser I was. Time for some truth. My father went pale. First, let's discuss money, since you're all wondering what happened to mine. William, remember when dad left me $50,000 and you convinced Me to invest it in your restaurant. The one that mysteriously burned down? I know you torched it for insurance money. I have the security footage. Gasps filled the room. My father started toward the screen, but froze when Harold continued. Patricia, sweet sister. You've been stealing from Mom's nursing home account for six years. I have the bank records. Already sent them to the authorities yesterday, so expect a visit soon. My aunt Patricia ran for the door, but two police officers were already walking in. Gordon, baby brother.

I never wanted kids. Not because I didn't like them. I just never pictured myself as a parent. My life was simple. Wake up, go to work, come home, repeat. But that all changed because of my neighbor's son. After his mom, Maya, got injured in a car crash, I started driving her eight year old son, Lucas, to school. It I was on my way to work anyway, and she had no one else to help. At the time, Lucas was a quiet kid, polite, always clutching a backpack that looked bigger than him. But once he got comfortable, he talked my ear off about dinosaurs. Every morning it was some new fact about T. Rexes or velociraptors. Started googling Dinosaur facts at night just so I could keep up with him. The way his whole face lit up when I remembered the names made it feel worth it. One morning, he didn't say much. We were halfway to school before I noticed the silence. I asked if he was okay, and he said some kids had made fun of him because he didn't have a dad coming to career day. He tried to brush it off, but I saw the tears building in his eyes. He was trying to act tough, but it was breaking him. Without even thinking, I offered to go. I told him I was just a mechanic, nothing special. But if He wanted I could bring in some car parts and talk about engines. His eyes lit up like I had offered to bring a spaceship. That week, I showed up with tools, heart, and a demo board. I explained to a room full of third graders how engines work, how spark plugs fire, how fuel turns into power. They loved it. But Lucas sat in the front row, hands on his knees, grinning like he'd been waiting for this moment his whole life. Every time I asked a question, his hand shot up. He already knew the answers. After school, he hugged me. Then he leaned in close and whispered, I wish you were my dad. I didn't know what to say. That night, Maya called to thank me. We ended up talking for hours about everything. Our lives, our regrets, our dreams. How sometimes the best families are the ones that find each other. Two years later, Lucas stood next to me as the best man at our wedding. In his speech, he said, I knew you'd be my dad the day you Learned about

He's been working at Westfield Mall for, like, eight years and only ever told kids to stop running or get off the fountain edge. What do you mean? I pulled away from his grip, but he held tighter. There on his desk were printouts of my school photo taped to every monitor. My face was everywhere. Gary locked the office door and pulled down the blinds so fast, one of them bent away from the windows. His hands were shaking as he picked up his radio. This is some kind of mistake, right? I tried to laugh, but it came out wrong. Maybe someone thinks I shoplifted or something. Gary wasn't listening. He was punching numbers into his desk phone using some kind of code. Alpha 7 7. Requesting immediate federal backup. Confirm visual on the target. The target? That's when I noticed the monitors showing them all corridors. Men in dark suits were spreading out through the food court. They weren't shopping. They were searching. I need to call my parents. I pulled out my phone, but my dad's number went straight to a disconnected message. Not voicemail, just disconnected. I tried again. Same thing. My mom picked up on the third ring, but her voice sounded Wrong. Strangled. Honey, where are you right now? She was trying to sound calm, but I could tell she'd been crying. I'm at the mall with Emma. Mom, what's going on? There was silence for a few seconds, and I heard muffled voices in the background. Male voices. Stay exactly where you are. Don't leave that office. Don't trust anyone except the guard. The line went dead. I tried calling back, but now her phone was disconnected, too. Gary was watching the monitors, and his face had gone pale. They're at every entrance. 12 of them at least. Who? Who's at every entrance? I moved closer to look at the screens. The men in suits were showing something to store employees. My photo. They had my photo. Gary pulled open his desk drawer and took out a gun. An actual gun? I didn't even know mall security could have guns. He checked if it was loaded and set it on the desk within reach. Listen, kid, I got a federal alert.

Yeah, he bought it from some guy on Craigslist about three months ago, but I'm the one who drives it mostly now, since I just got my license. The mechanic wiped his hands on a rag and walked me around to the front of my Subaru Legacy while my dad waited in the shop's lobby, scrolling through his phone, probably answering work emails. He brought the car in for a simple oil change, but the mechanic had been under there for way longer than normal, and now his face looked like someone had died. He popped the hood and pointed a flashlight at something underneath that I couldn't really see from where I was standing, but his hand was trembling. You need to get your dad over here right now. And nobody drives this car again until we fix this. His voice was steady, but there was something in his eyes that made my stomach drop. Like when you miss a step going downstairs. Someone wanted you dead, and they almost succeed. Another day or two of driving this thing and you wouldn't be standing here. What's wrong with it? I asked while texting my dad to come outside immediately. But the mechanic was already taking pictures with his phone and muttering about calling the police, which made no sense for a car repair. My dad pushed through the door, looking annoyed because he'd Been in the middle of a work haul. But his expression changed when he saw the mechanic's face. The mechanic grabbed a trouble light and aimed it at the brake lines near the master cylinder, showing us cuts that went almost all the way through the metal. These were sliced to leak slowly over weeks. So when they finally failed, it would look like a tragic act. Accident that nobody would question. He moved the light to show three different cut points, all at calculated angles that would have failed simultaneously. Professional job. But they made one mistake. They used a specific cutting pattern I've only seen once before. My dad's face went white as he stared at the sabotaged brake lines. And I remembered last week when I'd slam the brakes to avoid a dog. And felt them go completely.

But I recorded everything and sent him straight to jail. My entire childhood is filled with memories of my elder brother being coddled by my family. My parents are very traditional, and they were certain that my brother would take care of them, while I would turn out to be a failure. They would take him to the movies, but tell me that I needed to stay home and study. I remember he got the new Game Boy for his eighth birthday, and I wanted the same thing because he would never share it. But when I asked for a gift, they grounded me because demanding things is not a good attitude. Ever since then, I became scared to ask for anything. I had to go to bed hungry one time because no one called me for dinner, and I was too afraid to ask for food. This one time, when we were around 13, he kicked a football and smashed one of the windows in our house. He knew that our dad was very strict about playing football inside, so he told them that it was me who broke the window. I tried explaining that I was hanging out with my friends at the time, but they didn't believe me. I was grounded to my room for an entire week. All my toys were taken from me. By the time I entered high school, I was practically Ignoring everyone at home and focusing on finding a job. That's because my parents had made it clear that they would sponsor my brother's college tuition, but not mine. So if I wanted to get further education, I needed to save up for it on my own. So I started balancing my school life alongside a job in retail. Fortunately, I met some friends in high school with whom I later started a business. When I turned 18, my parents kicked me out of their house, so I went to live with one of those friends. I use the money I saved up for college to invest in our business, and thankfully, it became successful. Now I just bought a new house and held a Celebration to which I invited all my friends and family who supported me. My parents and my brother were not invited. However, my brother somehow found my address and showed up to the party in a suit.

Said he had to finish some project for his boss. I was already in bed watching Netflix on my laptop, wearing his old college T-shirt that still smelled like his Cologne. The thing is, I wasn't planning on staying up anyway. But around midnight, I heard footsteps on our front porch. Heavy boots. Like work boots. Figured Ryan forgot his keys again, which happened way too often for a 28 year old man. I paused my show and waited for him to knock. Instead, I heard metal clicking. Sounds like someone was picking the lock. My heart started racing. I grabbed my phone and crept to the bedroom window that faces our front door. There was a guy I'd never seen before hunched over our doorknob with some weird tools. He had a baseball cap pulled low and was wearing a dark jacket. I called 9 1 1, immediately whispered to the operator that someone was breaking into my house. She told me to stay hidden and quiet, that police were on their way. The whole time I'm watching this guy work on our lock like he owns the place. Then the front door opened. But here's the crazy part. The guy didn't sneak in like a burglar. He just walked in normally, turned on the Living room lights. And started looking around like he was shopping for furniture. He even checked his phone and made himself comfortable on our couch. Five minutes later, I heard another car pull up through the window. I saw Ryan getting out of his Honda. But instead of looking surprised or scared that our house lights were on, he walked right up to the front door like nothing was wrong. The locksmith guy let him in. They shook hands like old friends. That's when it clicked. Ryan had hired this guy to break into our own house. But why? We both had keys. I had a spare hidden under the fake rock by our mailbox that he knew about. I stayed hidden in the bedroom and

Dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief and shooting me these dramatic looks like I'm some kind of monster. Her lawyer keeps using words like premeditated harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress while showing photos of Patricia with a bruised forehead. He's describing how I supposedly commanded security guards to physically assault a defenseless 58 year old woman, how they threw her to the ground with excessive force, causing traumatic brain injury and permanent psychological damage. The whole time I'm sitting there thinking this has to be some kind of elaborate prank. Except the judge looks dead serious, and Patricia's lawyer just pulled out medical records. When it was my turn to present evidence, I didn't need a fancy lawyer because I had something better. The wedding videographers footage and security camera recordings from three different angles. I brought my laptop and asked if I could connect it to courtroom's TV screen. The judge nodded, probably curious about what actually happened. The first video showed Patricia entering the venue in her white gown, guests visibly confused, some taking pictures because they couldn't believe it. The second showed me politely asking her to leave, my voice calm and respectful on the audio. The third video, the important one, showed the security guards approaching Patricia with their hands visible and relaxed of them saying, ma'am, we need to ask you to leave. Please come with us. In the most professional Voice ever. Patricia screamed at them, but they never touched her, just gestured toward the exit and walked beside her, maintaining three feet of distance. Fourth video from the parking lot camera showed the real story. Patricia storming out, the guards standing by the door watching her leave, and then Patricia turning to scream something at them, spinning on her heel, dramatically catching her dress on her own shoe, and face planting into the concrete completely unassisted while the guards were 15 feet away. Yep. Patricia tripped and fell and then sued me.

So I'm sitting in the stuffy courtroom watching my mother in law's lawyer pace back and forth like he's defending a murder case. Except we're here because I had security escort her out of my wedding. My wife Sarah is next to me, holding my hand so tight I'm losing circulation. Probably remembering the actual events of our wedding day that LED to the circus. Whole mess started 18 months ago when my wife and I first got engaged. My mother in law, Patricia, decided that we weren't smart enough to plan a wedding. So she tried to plan everything. The venue, the flowers, food. Even tried to invite my family members she'd never met because their Facebook profiles didn't look classy enough. My wife started having anxiety attacks, would come home crying after every meeting with her mom about wedding stuff. We finally put our foot down and planned everything ourselves, only giving Patricia the standard mother of the bride duties. I responded by telling everyone that I was manipulating her daughter, that I'd stolen her away from the family, that I was probably after their money, even though I made more than her husband. Anyway, the wedding day started beautifully until Patricia walked in. She was wearing a floor length white wedding dress. My wife saw her mother wearing white and just broke down full sobbing with her makeup running everywhere, saying her mom was Ruining everything. Please, just make her leave. She begged me, so I did what I had to do. I pulled Patricia aside and quietly asked her to leave, that we didn't want her at our wedding. She laughed in my face, called me an idiot in a dollar store tuxedo, and continued bragging to other guests. That's when I called security. Two guys walked over and started to escort Patricia out. She lost her mind. She started screaming that I was a controlling psychopath, that I brainwashed her daughter, that everyone would see who I really was. I thought it was all a show for attention, so I forgot about it once she was gone and the wedding resumed. But a few weeks later, when she served me with the papers, only then did I realize just how crazy this woman was. Now she was sitting here in the

I always had this weird feeling about my Uncle Pete. Like, everyone in my family absolutely love the guy. He was the fun uncle. You know, the one who'd show up to family barbecues with his loud laugh and those expensive gifts that made all us kids go crazy. He take us out for burgers, let us play games on his phone for hours. And somehow he always knew all the latest slang before we did. But something about Pete just felt off to me. Maybe it was how he'd always squeeze into your personal space when he talked to you, standing way too close. Or how he always wanted to be alone with one of us kids, saying stuff like, let the grown UPS talk and pulling us into another room. My parents thought it was sweet that he wanted to spend time with us. I was 16 when my little cousin Emily started acting different. Emily was always this bubbly kid who asked a million questions and made everyone laugh with her silly jokes. But suddenly she got quiet. Like, really quiet. She stopped joking around completely. Stopped asking her usual why this and why that questions. When I'd ask her what was wrong, she just shrug and say she was tired. That wasn't Emily at all. One Saturday, I was helping my dad clean out the garage. We were sorting through old tools and junk when I saw this spare Key hanging on a little hook. It had a label that said Pete in my dad's handwriting. That made zero sense to me. Pete didn't live with us. He had his own apartment across town. Why would he need a key to our house? When I asked my dad about it, he just chuckled and said, Pete probably made a copy years ago when they used to share tools back and forth. You know how your uncle is, always borrowing something dad said. But something about that explanation felt wrong. Pete hadn't borrowed tools in years. That night, I couldn't sleep.

My brother's boss disagreed. I walk into the restaurant holding my eight year old daughter's hand, and she's never met these people. My family cut me off when I got pregnant at 17, called me a disappointment, and slammed the door in my face. Eight years later, they finally agreed to meet us. My mother looks me up and down. Oh, honey, at least you tried to look nice. I'm wearing my favorite sundress, but apparently it's not enough. She hugs my daughter like she has the right. She's so well behaved despite everything. Despite everything. Like my daughter's existence is something to forcome. My sister asks if I need money for school clothes. My father won't even look at me directly. They picked this specific restaurant because it's affordable, which means they think I'm broke. My mother actually says, don't worry, sweetie, we ordered water for the table. We know being a single mom is hard. The server keeps glancing at me nervously, but I shake my head at her. My brother slides a 20 across the table for gas money home like I'm still 17, borrowing the family car. My mother asks if I ever finished high school. When I say I graduated college, she goes, oh, online degrees count, too, honey. And my brother stands up all proud. I have an announcement. I just got hired as restaurant manager at this very chain. Everyone's clapping, and my mother says, See? Your brother didn't ruin his life. And look where he is now. My brother's bragging. I'm one of only four managers in the whole district. I report directly to regional. I'm making 60,000 a year. My father finally speaks to me. Maybe your brother can get you a job here. They're always hiring servers. My mother asks where the father of my daughter is, and I say, he left. Of course he did. What did you expect from having a baby so young? My sister shows photos from her Paris vacation last summer and tells me, maybe someday you can take your daughter somewhere nice. At one point, I managed to get out that I work in the restaurant industry. However, they keep assuming I mean waitressing. My mother tells another table very loudly, my daughter had so much potential. Got pregnant at 17. We tried to help, but she wouldn't listen. My daughter asks why grandma seems angry, and I tell her, Grandma's just confused. My brother's still going on about his promotion. The owner's supposed to stop by today.

So I showed him what family means. The first time Frank moved in, he made me eat in the kitchen while everyone else ate in the dining room. Real family only, he said, loud enough for my mom to hear. She didn't say anything, just look down at her plate. Every Sunday dinner ended the same way. Blood makes family. Everything else is just temporary arrangements. I was 14. Those words carve deep grooves in my chest. Mom never defended me, not once. Frank made sure I knew I was an outsider in my own home. When I turned 16, I overheard Frank talking to someone on the phone. The kids dead weight. Soon as he hits 18, he's out. I didn't sign up to raise another man's mistake. The person asked about my mom. She'll get over it. Women always choose their men over baggage from the past. That's when everything changed. I realised I could either leave defeated or show him what family really meant. I started researching Frank's family online. Found out his dad was a Marine who died alone 20 years ago. His dad had been searching for his old Marine buddies before he died, but never found them. I found one of them on Facebook. His name was Jeffreys. When I messaged him about Frank's dad, he started crying. On our video call, Jeffreys told me there were other Marines who served with Frank's dad. They've been trying to find him for 30 years. We met online every week to share memories. Meanwhile, Frank got worse. Started introducing me as my wife's son at gatherings. Made me park on the street so his friends wouldn't see my car. At my graduation, he told people he was there supporting his wife while I walked across the stage. Mom tried standing up for me once. Frank threatened to leave her. She never tried again. I almost gave up. Then maybe Frank was right. Maybe I didn't belong. For 18 months, I talked to Jeffreys and the Marines online every week. Some nights I wondered if this

I'm white. My wife Monica is black. And we've got two kids. Our son Tyler is 5 and our daughter Emma is 3. When Tyler was born, we'd only been together about a year. Monica got pregnant and we got married because of it. But honestly, we ended up actually happy together. But Tyler never looked like me, not even a little bit. Came out way darker than Monica. And he just didn't have any of those features you'd expect from a mixed kid. My mom would make these comments like, are you sure he's yours? And my dad would just give me these looks at family dinners. Even my friends started asking questions. I tried to ignore it, but it was eating at me. When Emma was born two years later, everything changed. She looked exactly like me. Same blue eyes, same nose, even the same dimple on her left cheek. Suddenly I understood what it felt like to look at your kid and know they're yours without a doubt. It was this crazy instant connection that I never had with Tyler. That's when the doubt really kicked in, started noticing how my family treated Emma differently. More pictures, more attention, more everything. And I realized I was doing it, too. I was trying to love Tyler the same way, but there was always this voice in my head going, what if he's not yours? Four. Months ago, I couldn't take it anymore. I took Tyler to get ice cream and swabbed his cheek while he was distracted, sent it off to one of those DNA places. Two weeks later, the results came back. He's.

My grandmother expected every family member to take their lives on their 50th birthday because living past that age was selfish and wasteful. But as the family matriarch at 78, she claimed she needed to stay live to oversee the tradition. Grandma Delilah had been the undisputed ruler of our family for as long as anyone could remember. She controlled every aspect of our lives from her massive Victorian mansion where three generations lived. Under her iron fist, everyone knew that Defying Delilah brought a spiritual curse upon your bloodline. That's what happened when Great Aunt Estelle refused. Some kind of dark energy consumed her daughter, driving her to hang herself. The very next day, Delilah told everyone that the girl had been so spiritually harmed by her mother's cowardice, she took her own life rather than live with a disgrace. Estelle took her life, too, three days later. Out of grief and guilt, Delilah kept photographs of both Estelle and her daughter displayed in her study as a reminder of what happens when family members don't follow tradition. Growing up, I watched family, family members disappear on their 50th birthday with chilling regularity. Every time it happened, all I could think about was my favorite person in the world, my mother. I felt sick knowing her time was coming closer every year. When my mom turned 49, Delilah began her year long preparation process. And I felt like I was watching my mother slowly disappear before my eyes. She moved mom into a special bedroom that Delilah called the transition suite and started monitoring every bite of food mom ate to ensure she was spiritually pure for her death. Delilah made mom practice writing her farewell note and rehearse her final speech for the family gathering. I watched my mother losing weight and developing dark circles under her eyes from the stress, and I knew I had to act fast. Mom would sneak into my room at night and beg me to promise I'd never let Delilah do this to me when I turned 50. And I'd hold her while she cried silently so Delilah wouldn't hear us. Those moments broke my heart because I could see how desperately she wanted to live.

The shooter, 22 year old Tyler Robinson, has already been identified and arrested. It turns out that his own dad turned him into the police after finding out what a disturbing thing his son has done, and he's now facing many charges. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Nepal has erupted. Weeks of youth LED protests over corruption and broken promises turned into full blown chaos. Government buildings were torched, the prime minister was forced to resign, and the one piece flag was even hung as a symbol of hope. And while all of that was happening, Mars quietly entered the conversation. NASA's rover has detected possible bio signatures, signs that there might have once been ancient life on the planet. It's the closest we've ever come to extraterrestrial life. At the same time, over 33,000 pages of the Jeffrey Epstein files were released to the public. Thousands of names and connections that people are still combing through. With some of the world's most powerful figures being linked to him. It's only been 12 days and it already feels like the whole world balance is shifting.

No, I didn't, because my daughter woke up in the middle of the night, looked me dead in the eyeball, and said, Mommy, I'm afraid of what's under the bed. And in my head, I was thinking, that's really fucking creepy. I, too, am now afraid of what's under the bed. That's not what I said, though. No, what I said was, honey, there's nothing under the bed. Just go back to sleep. Did I believe that? No. Actually, I'm pretty sure there was something under the bed, but I lied to her for her comfort. And then she asked me to check under the bed. And in my head, I was like, ain't no fucking way am I getting out of bed right now to check under it. Instead, I reassured her that there was nothing under the bed, and I told her to go back to sleep. And she tried for a minute. Her eyes fluttered. They. They, like, a little bit, and then they popped right open again. And she was looking at the TV, the TV that was turned off in our dark room. And she goes, mommy, who's that on the TV? And in my head, I'm thinking, dog, I don't fucking know. You tell me. You're the one seeing dead people. Who the fuck is that on the TV? Because I don't see it, but I'm terrified. I don't say that. No, instead, I Say, honey, the TV's turned off. There's no one on the TV. Just go back to sleep. And she falls back asleep eventually. You know who doesn't? Me. Because I'm afraid of what's under the bed now. And I'm wondering who the fuck that was on my TV. On my TV that was turned off. Who was it? And now I'm thinking, I need to fucking spray my daughter with holy water. Except I don't have holy water. What I do have is Dawn dish soap power scrub. I could spray her with that, hit her with a microfiber towel and hope that fucking works. I'm terrified right now. And I'm a little bit tired, but mostly terrified.

So my wife, Emma, came home last Tuesday with that look on her face, the one all guilty and nervous like she just got caught stealing candy. She sat me down on our ratty old couch and started crying before she even said anything. Turns out she'd been hooking up with her coworker Jake for like three months. Three months while I was working double shifts at the warehouse to save up for our anniversary trip to Florida. She kept saying sorry over and over, begging me not to leave her, promising she'd cut all contact with this guy. I just sat there staring at our wedding photo on the coffee table, the one where we're both laughing because my cousin Rick photobombed us making bunny ears. We looked so happy, so stupid. Emma grabbed my hands and asked if I could ever forgive her. And here's where I became a complete psychopath. I looked her dead in the eyes and said yes. I told her we could work through this, that our marriage was stronger than one mistake, all that bullshit you see in movies. But I was lying through my teeth. The next morning, I called in sick to work and drove straight to Jake's apartment, found his address through Emma's Instagram. She tagged him at some restaurant last month. Dude answered the door in his boxers looking all confused. Introduce myself as Emma's husband and Watched his face go white. Then I very calmly explained that I knew everything and that he had exactly 24 hours to quit his job and move out of town or I'd be paying visits to his parents, his ex girlfriend Sarah, who he was apparently trying to win back, and his boss who definitely didn't know he was screwing around with married co workers. Jake started stuttering about how sorry he was, how it meant nothing. I just smiled and handed him a printed email I'd already drafted to his entire office explaining the situation, told him this would be sent if he wasn't gone by Thursday. Me while at home, I was being the perfect forgiveness husband, made Emma her favorite pasta dinner, bought her flowers, even suggested couple therapy. She was so relieved and grateful, telling me how lucky she was to have such an understanding husband. Thursday came and Jake was gone. Just like that, Emma came home from work all confused because apparently he'd quit without notice and moved back to Ohio or something. She kept asking why he just disappear like that. I waited exactly one more week, let her think we were rebuilding our trust. Then last Friday, I casually mentioned over breakfast that I changed my mind about the whole forgiveness thing. Her face went from confused to terrified in about two seconds. I told her I'd known.

The courtroom erupted until I stood, handed the judge a two page document, and said, check again. Judge simply looked at my wife and burst out laughing. My name is James, and three months ago I caught my wife Lauren cheating with her yoga instructor. Filed for divorce immediately thinking she'd hit the Jackpot. Since we've been married for five years, Lauren strutted into that Phoenix courtroom wearing a two thousand dollar dress I'd bought her. Confident as hell. Her lawyer was already calculating his commission on what they thought would be a four million dollar payout for my construction business and dad's inheritance. The whole courtroom was packed. Lauren had actually invited some of her friends to watch what she called James's comeuppance. She been telling everyone for weeks how she was about to become independently wealthy. Your honor, her attorney announced, adjusting his expensive tie, Mrs. Peterson deserves substantial compensation for supporting her husband's career growth during their five year marriage. Lauren actually winked at me from across the room. She thought I was just some heartbroken guy who'd roll over and pay whatever she demanded. Her friends in the gallery were practically grinning, waiting for the show. But here's what Lauren didn't know. Six months before I caught her cheating, I'd started noticing weird charges on our joint credit card. Expensive dinners at restaurants I'd never been to, hotel rooms, Booked during girls trips that didn't add up. Designer lingerie purchases that never made it home. The final straw was when I found an eight hundred dollar charge at a jewelry store downtown. When I asked Lauren about it, she said she'd bought herself a birthday present. Problem was, her birthday wasn't for four months. So I hired a private investigator named Frank. Best $5,000 I ever spent. Frank followed Lauren for six weeks. What he discovered was worse than I imagined. The yoga instructor was just the latest in a long line of. There's. There was also her personal trainer, a bartender from her favorite restaurant, and even one of my own business partners. Lauren had been using our joint accounts to fund these relationships. Expensive gifts, romantic getaways. Been paying for her affairs, gym memberships. She'd blown through nearly $50,000 of our money over two years. The two page document I handed Judge Ramirez wasn't financial records. It was Frank's detailed investigation report proving Lauren had been having multiple affairs for over two years. Complete with time stamped photos, hotel receipts, restaurant bills, and screenshots of explicit text. In Arizona, adultery doesn't automatically disqualify you from alimony. But it sure does when you've been systematically draining marital assets to fund your affairs. It's called waste of marital property, and it's a big deal in divorce court. The judge read the first page slowly, his eyebrows climbing higher with each line. He flipped to page two, studied the photos. And then burst out laughing so hard his

I had a crush on a girl for five years and in high school I finally convinced her to go out with me on our first date. I quickly realized how insanely wealthy her parents were and I had no idea. I grew up with basically nothing. So I thought if she ever found out, she'd break up with me. I hit it pretty well for a few months and she literally had no idea I worked the night shift at McDonald's. When she asked what I did, I lied and told her I ran my own company, which made her like me even more. Almost every time we'd eat somewhere, she always made jokes about how the people working there were losers. So I knew she'd for sure leave me if she found out. I thought maybe she wouldn't care if I waited a few months. But before I could gain the courage to tell her, she asked me to meet her parents. I was extremely nervous that day and had to work an 8 hour shift before I went over. I was running on two hours of sleep and just barely made it to their house in time. I could tell they really liked me and when they asked about my company, I continued to lie and said I was already really successful, everything was going good. But when we sat down for dinner, they asked me to say a Prayer before we ate, my two hour sleep was really starting to hit me. So when I closed my eyes, my brain took over. I wasn't thinking at all. And in front of her entire family said, thank you for choosing McDonald's. May I take your order? I immediately realized what I said and looked up at them. They were confused at first but quickly figured it out. She broke up with me that night and I'm now dating her sister.

But about two hours later, I woke up to her jumping up on the bed. I thought she must have just heard something and tried to go back to sleep. However, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. I looked around the room and when I looked at my door, I saw it. This was the single creepiest thing I've ever seen because the same guy from earlier was now looking at me through my door, my Adrenaline instantly kicked in. I heard a really loud scream and after a second realised it was coming from me. I jumped up to shut my door, but he started pushing back. I couldn't even imagine what he was planning to do if he got inside. So I pushed as hard as I could before locking it. I had to grab my cat and climbed out my window to run to our neighbour's house. They called the police and my parents came home as quick as they could. We found where he broke our basement window to get inside and they arrested him the next day. But it was worth it because I got to keep my cat.

My son had just gotten his driver's license, and we just bought him his first car for his 16th birthday. I was so proud and waved to him as I watched him drive off that morning. I remember finally getting some alone time when my wife called me. I answered it and heard her crying and dreaming, but I couldn't understand anything she was saying. She told me just to get in my car and start driving because there was an accident on the way to school. The police called her and told her someone ran a red light and hit him. Remember driving there thinking she was overreacting and he'd be okay. But when I saw his car completely crushed, I couldn't breathe. I watched them pull him out, and I couldn't even look. We ended up waiting at the hospital for 10 hours, and they were the longest of my life. Eventually, when the doctor finally came out to see us, he told us our son was alive. He was breathing, but he wasn't awake. He was in a coma. And they weren't sure when he'd wake up. So we sat with him for a few days. We played his favourite music and talked to him, and I like to think he could hear us. Then we got the worst news ever. He had severe brain damage and that he'd never wake up. We decided to turn off his life support. And said goodbye forever. However, a year later, the craziest thing happened. We got a card in the mail thanking us and thanking our son. We had no idea, but they actually used my son's heart to save this guy's life. We agreed for him to be an organ donor. And a month later, we met the guy and got the best gift we've ever received. We got to listen to our son's heartbeat one more time.

But her face immediately dropped when she realised that we tricked her. My sister in law, Maya, has always been competitive with me, since the day I married her brother Jake. She couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, I tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me, and from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd to flash, she'd push harder. Come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our our nursery and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail. When she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages, desperately searching For any evidence of our name decision. My husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use it first. She wouldn't do that, he said. But I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created a interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter, with final decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition. And I'm so excited you finally decided! Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations. Sing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think? She'd say. Watching our faces carefully. I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived! The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my Reaction to her surprise the next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness when I walked into her room. She actually had the audacity to say, I hope you don't mind that we ended up using Aurora when she was born. It just felt so right for our daughter. I know you guys were considering it, too.

So I got the perfect revenge. She crashed our cabin weekend claiming her Airbnb fell through. I knew it was BS the moment she showed up with a perfectly packed bag and a smug smile. My boyfriend Joseph felt bad for her and invited her to stay without even asking me. For three days straight, she kept creating these elaborate situations to make me look like the worst girlfriend ever. Like when she helped make dinner on Friday night. She volunteered to preheat the oven while I prepped ingredients. Everything seemed normal until I put our carefully marinated steaks in and they came out completely charred. She acted shocked when Joseph got mad at me for ruining our expensive dinner. Later, I noticed she'd secretly cranked the oven to 500 degrees. Saturday morning, she suggested we go hiking to this amazing waterfall she'd been to before. She gave me detailed directions to the trailhead while she rode with Joseph. Turns out she sent me to the wrong trail entirely. I spent two hours lost in the woods with no cell service while they bonded over waiting for me. When I finally found them at the actual trailhead, Joseph was visibly annoyed I'd kept them waiting. She just shrugged and said, oh, I guess I mixed up the directions. My bad. The manipulation got worse as the weekend went on. She kept doing this thing where she'd bring up inside jokes and memories from before I existed, making make me feel like an outsider in my own relationship. Remember when we did this? And remember when we did that? Always with this little smile directed at me. She'd also accidentally brush against Joseph, constantly grab his arm when laughing, and find excuse is to lean over him. During Saturday afternoon, we decided to go swimming in the lake. She conveniently forgot to pack a swimsuit and asked to borrow one of mine. The one she picked was my smallest bikini, and she made sure to comment loudly about how loose it was on her while adjusting it right in front of Joseph. Then she suggested we play volleyball in the water and kept accidentally bumping into me, making me lose my balance. The breaking point was Saturday night, we were all sitting by the fire when she pretended to be drunk and started crying about how much she missed the old days before I came along and changed everything. She was literally sobbing into Joseph's shoulder.

A really well known celebrity that graduated from our high school was coming to speak one morning and a lot of the girls were really excited. But an hour before it was supposed to start, we were told to go to the gym and not bring anything. When I walked in, there were police dogs and officers searching everybody. Nobody really thought it was weird because this person was famous. But when everyone was inside the gym, we were told we weren't allowed to leave. This is when it started to seem weird. And after a while, some people were asking to go to the bathroom. They had to be escorted by police officers and they started asking every guy wearing a gray shirt to come down and talk to them. Lunch passed and people were getting angry and we had to eat in the gym. Nobody knew what was happening and none of the teachers would say anything. cops kept showing up to talk to people and wouldn't let anyone leave. One guy tried to fight one of the cops when he wouldn't let him out and they actually arrested him. It was past the end of school and still nobody was allowed out of the gym. Parents couldn't pick us up either because they couldn't even come on the property. Apparently the entire school was surrounded and everyone was getting really mad. So our principal finally told us what Was going on. She sounded really on edge and told us the police were searching the school because there was a bomb threat in one of the bathrooms. I'll never forget how quiet it was and everyone was terrified. Nobody was allowed to leave until they found who did it. But after a half hour, they took another kid down and arrested him. We all knew it was him because we were allowed to leave after. But it was surprising because he was one of the popular guys. Everyone knew this was super weird for him. But the next morning we found out what happened and nobody could believe it. They looked through the cameras for the entire day because one of our older teachers had heard a boy in a gray shirt say something in the hallway. Turns out he completely misunderstood what he meant when he overheard him telling another boy that he was gonna blow up the bathroom later that day.

I've been the family disappointment for 23 years while my perfect older brother Kyle got everything handed to him when Grandpa died and left me his house in his will. Dad absolutely lost it. There's no way that senile old man left you anything, he snarled, pacing around our kitchen like a king aged animal. You're probably not even my real son. Anyway, your mother was sleeping around before we got married. My brother Kyle smirked from the corner. Yeah, remember how wild mom was back in college? Dad's got a point. My stepmother Linda chimed in with that fake sweet voice she always used. Honey, we just want what's fair for the real family. You understand, right? They gave me 48 hours to take a paternity test or they challenge the will in court. The whole extended family was already texting about it in the group chat, calling me a fraud and a bastard. Here's what none of them knew. I've been secretly taking care of Grandpa for the past two years while they all ignored him. Every single doctor's appointment when his arthritis got bad, every grocery run when he couldn't drive anymore, every lonely evening when he just wanted someone to talk to about grandma. I also knew about the second will he'd written just three months before he died. The next morning, dad changed the locks on Grandpa's house when I showed up with my key. I couldn't get in. My stuff was piled on the front lawn and garbage bags. You're trespassing, dad yelled from the window. This is family property until you prove you belong here. I called the police. Within an hour, Officer Ortiz was standing in the driveway reading the will. Sir, according to this legal document, your son owns this property. You're the one trespassing. Dad's face went red as they made him give me the new keys. The neighbors were all watching from their windows. Test day arrived at the family lawyer's office. The whole crew showed up like it was some kind of Celebration. Dad wore his best suit and kept checking his Rolex, probably already planning how to spend what he thought would be his inheritance money. Kyle brought his new girlfriend to show off. You're about to see how we handle fake family members, he told her loudly. Linda kept taking selfies, probably planning to post about their victory later. Uncle Robert and Aunt Deborah drove in from two states away just to witness my humiliation. The family group chat had been buzzing for days about this showdown.

So I moved across the country for my dream job. But six months later, she showed up at my door, saying, I'm ready to commit now, because distance doesn't matter when it's real love. And I laughed before introducing her to my new fiance, who was cooking dinner in our kitchen. I'm Marcus, 26, and when Jess dumped me six months ago, she said I was emotionally unavailable and socially stunted. Her exact words. You hide behind your work and can't form real connections. I need someone who actually has friends and knows how to be vulnerable. This happened right after I got accepted to my dream veterinary residency in Denver. We've been together two years, and I thought we were solid. I was planning to propose that Christmas, even had the ring picked out. The breakup destroyed me. I spent three days eating cereal in bed, questioning everything. Was I really that disconnected? Maybe she was right. Maybe I was just using her as a placeholder while focusing on my career. But I'd committed to the residency. So I packed up and drove to Denver with just my clothes, textbook, and a broken heart. If I was going to be miserable, at least I'd do something I loved. The animal hospital was this busy emergency clinic downtown. Doctor Peterson put me on 12 hour Shifts immediately. I was so exhausted learning new procedures that I barely thought about Jess. Something unexpected happened, though. My colleague Mike kept inviting me to trivia night at this bar. I made excuses. Too tired, had studying. But Mike was persistent, and I finally gave in just to shut him up. Trivia night was actually fun. Mike's team called themselves the Possum 4 and competed against other medical professionals. I was weirdly good at Animal Facts, making me valuable for the first time in months. I was laughing and genuinely enjoying people's company. Company. Mike introduced me to his hiking group. Outdoorsy medical people doing weekend trails around Colorado. I'd always loved nature, but never had anyone to explore with. Suddenly, I was spending Saturdays climbing mountains and having real conversations with people, but who weren't Jess. Then I started volunteering at the city animal shelter on days off. They needed someone with medical training for health assessments. That's where I met Diana. She was the shelter coordinator. This amazing woman who knew every single animal's personality and hit

Three months in, she calls me into a conference room with my whole team watching through the glass walls. We're going in a different direction. She announces, your position is redundant. You're terminated effective immediately. I've been there eight years. Here's built every client relationship from scratch. But I just nodded professionally and started packing my desk.

What presentation? I turn back with a smile. The Hollowgate systems review. Big one. Oh, well, you'll figure it out. Her face went pale. See, Hollowgate was our biggest client, a two point three million dollar annual contract. They were flying their entire sea suite in from Seattle Friday morning for a comprehensive technical review. I've been preparing for three months. All the calibration specs, sensor protocols, compliance documentation, everything was stored in my personal leather notebooks that I bought with my own money. Over the years, Jessica had never bothered learning the technical side. She was all about relationship optimization and digital transformation. But our clients were old school engineers who wanted Detailed hands on expertise. Friday morning at 8:00am, my phone starts buzzing. Jessica calling. I let it ring, then again. By 9:15, she'd called 12 times. At 9:33, my former teammate Beth texts me, SOS Hollowgate team is here. Jessica's in full panic mode. Where are the technical specs they're asking for? I'm sipping coffee on my porch typing back. Should be in the system, she says. There's nothing, just basic contact info. Of course, there wasn't. All the real technical documentation lived in my notebooks, stuff that mattered, sensor calibration tolerances, environmental testing parameters, custom modification requests. I'd handwritten everything during countless client calls and site visits. At 10:15, Beth calls directly. Randy, they're asking for you specifically. The CTO wants to discuss the pressure sensor modifications you designed for their Portland.

I told her we were having a family reunion. Sarah finally found her voice. You planned this whole thing? You gave me six months to prepare after I took that DNA test. I shrugged. Did you really think I'd just sit on information this explosive? I opened the door. Jessica, come in. Meet your biological family. Jessica walked in, looking exactly like mom did in old photos. Hi, everyone. I'm so excited to finally meet you all. The silence was deafening. Dad was gripping his chair so hard, his knuckles were white. Mom looked like she might faint. Jessica's a pediatric nurse, I announced carefully. She brought cookies she baked herself. Isn't that sweet? Jessica smiled nervously at the shocked faces. I hope I'm not intruding. Jake said this was a good time to meet everyone. Oh, it's perfect timing, I said. Sarah here was just questioning whether I belonged in this family. Turns out the real question is whether this living room is big enough for all of Mom's children. My phone buzzed. Oh, Michael just landed. He'll be here in 30 minutes. I looked around at their devastated faces. You know, What? I think I'll go help Jessica bring in her luggage. She's staying for the week. As we walked outside, Jessica whispered, are they always this quiet? Don't worry, I said, glancing back at the chaos through the window. They're just processing some new family dynamics. By the way, Michael's bringing his twin daughters. They're 8 and absolutely adorable. Jessica's eyes lit up. I've always wanted nieces. Well, you're about to have plenty of family, I said. Emma has two little boys, and David mentioned he has a teenage son who's excited to meet everyone. Through the window, I could see Sarah trying to fan mom with a Christmas card while dad paced around the living room like a caged animal. Should we go back in? Jessica asked. Look, I'm concerned. Let's give them another minute, I said. They're still adjusting to the fact that they're black sheep. Just became the family detective. Sometimes the truth doesn't just set you free. It redefines everyone's understanding of what family really means.

Growing up, I never realised how poor we were and thought it was normal that we all had to sleep in the basement all winter. Our house had holes in the walls so it was the only place we could all stay warm at night. One year on Christmas Eve, my sister and I woke up to a loud bang outside and could hear people shouting at each other. My dad started to panic and ran upstairs to make sure our doors were locked. I was only four and remember sitting there crying while my mom covered my ears. We couldn't see what was going on because the window was covered in snow, but soon saw the police lights reflecting off of it. I was really scared because my dad wasn't coming back down, but a few minutes later he walked back downstairs with Santa Claus. My sister and I instantly forgot all all about the shouting and got really excited. He told us not to worry and that his sleigh had crashed into the snow outside. The shouting were just kind police officers that were helping him dig it out of the snow. He brought us presents to open and sang Christmas songs until the sirens were gone. he said he had to go back to delivering presents for the other kids. I went to sleep that night thinking I was The luckiest kid ever. But it wasn't until I was 17 that I Learned what really happened. Gang tried to break into the house across the street from mine, and a few people died right outside that window. The older man who lived next to us knew we had undoubtedly scared kids and happened to have a Santa costume. He put it on and tried to keep us calm until it was over.

Our son Ethan appeared in the doorway rubbing his sleepy eyes, still wearing the expensive new jacket I'd never seen before in my life. Mom, what's happening? Why are all of Dad's clothes sitting outside in bags? Your father forgot it was my birthday today, honey. But he certainly remembered to take you to see his ex girlfriend instead. Ethan's little face Crum fold with confusion. She said she was just Dad's old friend from college. She bought me ice cream and told me. What exactly did she tell you, baby? That maybe someday we could all live together like one big happy family. Marcus grabbed my arm desperately, his grip almost painful. You can't just destroy and tear our entire family apart over this one thing I already did. Now the courts will decide who Ethan really belongs. With his confident smirk, the same one he'd worn for years whenever I questioned his suspicious late nights, I vanished completely when he realized I wasn't the same naive woman who used to wait up for him every single night with dinner warming in the oven. Paisley, please be reasonable. We can work this whole thing out between us. Marissa honestly means absolutely nothing to me. I pulled out my phone and played the damming video again. Really? Because she apparently has dozens of videos of you two together going back 6 months, beach trips, romantic dinner dates, family. Photos with my son. How did you even, she sent it by complete accident. Meant to send it to her sister, not our old college group chat. Funny how technology works against cheater. Marcus sank heavily into the couch, burying his head in his hands. I swear I never meant for any of this to happen, but it did happen. And now you get to explain to our son why daddy lied about where they were going every single weekend. The next morning, the family court judge granted me temporary full custody. Marcus got supervised visits exactly twice a week. Six months later, Ethan asked me out of nowhere, mom, are you actually happier now? I looked at my son, really looked at him and realized he was, too. Sometimes the best birthday gift is discovering who you really married. And sometimes it's discovering who you really are when you finally stop making excuses for the people who hurt you most. The woman who used to wait up with dinner, she's gone forever. And I've never missed her for a single second.

I was definitely Dad's biological son. Dad's victory dance and high fives with Kyle lasted exactly 10 seconds. However, the lawyer continued clearing his. There's something else the family needs to know about. Your grandfather actually left a second more recent will that supersedes the first one. The room went dead silent. You could hear Linda's phone camera clicking. I pulled out my phone and played a video I'd recorded with Grandpa just weeks before he passed. His shaky but determined voice filled the entire office. To my son Harold and his family who abandoned me in my final years, who only called when they needed money, you get absolute we nothing. To my grandson Noah, who stayed by my side, who drove me to chemo appointments, who held my hand when I was scared. The house, the life insurance, the savings account, everything is yours. You earned every penny through Love, not blood. Dad's face turn completely white, then red, then purple. That's not legally binding. He was senile. Actually, the lawyer smiled, sliding papers across the table. It's perfectly legal, signed, witnessed and notarized. Just three months ago when his mind was completely sound. I have medical records to prove his mental competency. Kyle started yelling about how unfair it was. This is bullshit. We're his real family. Linda was frantically texting, probably trying to spin this disaster to her friends. Uncle Robert just Sat there with his mouth hanging open. I stood up slowly looking each of them in the eyes. Thanks for making this so public, dad. Now everyone in the family knows exactly who you really are. Grandpa always said actions speak louder than words. As I walked toward the door with my copy of the will, dad grabbed my arm. This isn't over. I'll sue you for everything. I smiled and pulled out another document. Actually, it is over. This is Grandpa's final letter to you. Want me to read it out loud? His grip loosened. I shook free and headed for the exit. You're dead to me, he screamed. I turned back one last time. Funny, that's exactly what Grandpa said about you. The last thing I heard was Linda sobbing about their reputation as the door closed behind me.

I smirked, paid my tab and walked out. Ten minutes later she was frantically calling as her friends vanished and left her with the entire 800 dollar Bill. Script. I've been dating Kendra for four months. Last Friday was supposed to be drinks downtown, just the two of us. I arrived at eight PM to find her already there with five other people. Three women, two guys I'd never met. Babe, you made it. She kissed my cheek. These are my friends from my Pilates studio. Weird that she didn't mention bringing people, but whatever. I'm social. We got a big table. Everyone started ordering appetizers, entrees, desserts, the works. One friend, Tiffany, ordered an eighty five dollar bottle of wine for herself. Within an hour, the Bill was at six hundred dollars and climbing. Her friends were treating this like their personal party, ordering rounds of 18 hour cocktails like water. I pulled Kendra aside. Hey, what's the deal? This. This is getting expensive. She laughed. Don't worry about it. Who's paying for all this? That's when she dropped it loud enough for everyone to hear. Obviously you are. If you can't pay for all my friends drinks, you're not a real man. That's basic boyfriend stuff. The whole table went quiet. Tiffany smirked and said, yeah, my boyfriend always covers everyone when we go out. I looked at Kendra. She was dead. Serious? Good to know, I said. I stood up, walked to the bar and closed out my tab. Just what I'd ordered. Two beers, $24 with tip. Paid it. What are you doing? Kendra asked. Fused being real with myself, I said. Then I walked out. My phone started blowing up before I reached my car. I didn't answer. Just drove home. Ten minutes later, Kendra sent a frantic voice message. She was screaming. The moment I left, her friends suddenly remembered they had other places to be. Every single one vanished, leaving her with an 800+ Bill that was still growing because they'd ordered more drinks right before I left. The best part? She didn't have her credit card. She'd left it at home because, quote from her text, I knew you'd be paying like a real man should. She had to call her roommate to bring her card. At ten PM on a Friday. Saturday morning, I woke up to 52 missed calls. Not just from Kendra, but from her mom. Her mom left a voicemail. You abandoned my daughter at a restaurant with a Bill she couldn't pay. You need to Venmo her $863 47 and right now and apologize. 863 fourty 7 sub 7. They calculated it down to the penny. Then Kendra texted from her roommate's phone. I had to use my rent money to pay that Bill. You need to pay me back. This is literally theft. I'm giving you one chance. 863 o 47+ $200 for emotional distress. Emotional distress? She wanted damages because I wouldn't pay for her friends drinks. Sunday afternoon she showed up at my apartment with her roommate and some guy trying to look intimidating. They were banging on my door. I watched through my ring camera as

I texted our family group chat emergency appendectomy tomorrow. Need someone to pick up Max from daycare. My sister Amber replied, lol can't. We're literally boarding for Cabo right now. Mom added, ask your neighbor. This trip cost us $3,000. I simply wrote got it. My four year old son Max had been asking all week why Aunt Lily and grandma couldn't help when daddy was sick. I told him they were on an important trip. He nodded seriously and said, more important than you getting better. The drive to the hospital at five am was terrifying. Max's overnight bag was packed with his stuffed elephant and three days worth of clothes. Mrs. Chen, my seventy four year old neighbor, met us at her door in her bathrobe. She's spoke broken English but hugged Max like he was her own grandson. Don't worry, she whispered to me. I take good care. What was supposed to be a routine appendectomy turned into a nightmare. Internal bleeding kept me unconscious for 18 hours. When I I woke up, machines were beeping and tubes were everywhere. The surgeon explained I'd need to stay at least six days for monitoring. My phone had dozens of missed calls, but none from family. Instead, there were voicemails from Missus Chen and her careful English. Max eating good breakfast. He helped me water plants. He very good boy. Day three I was finally stable enough to Facetime Max, sitting at Mrs. Chen's kitchen table, carefully folding dumplings with tiny fingers covered in flour. Daddy! Mrs. Chen teaching me to make food. She says I'm very smart. He held up a lopsided dumpling proudly. In the background, Mrs. Chen beamed and gave me a thumbs up. That same day, my phone rang. Hospital administration. Mr. Rodriguez, your mother called demanding to speak with your doctor about visiting hours. She was quite insistent about getting details regarding your condition. When we explained you'd been here since Monday with applications from emergency surgery, she became extremely upset. I was confused. She called you? Yes. She seems surprised you were here at all. She mentioned something about thinking you were being dramatic about a simple teacher. Thirty minutes later, my phone exploded. Mom? Daniel, why didn't you tell us you were dying? Amber? OMG, I'm literally shaking RN. I had no idea it was serious. Mom, again? We're booking flights home right now. This is insane. I was too weak to respond immediately, but I managed to piece together what happened through a friend who'd seen Amber's Instagram Stories. She'd been posting beach content all week, including a story yesterday of Max eating breakfast at some random Asian lady's house with crying, laughing emojis. The caption read, my brother's parenting choices are wild. Like, why is my nephew at a stranger's house? Elmo. A family friend, Missus Rodriguez from church, had seen the story. And called mom in a panic. Why is little Max staying with strangers? Where's Daniel? Is everything okay? Mom had apparently brushed it off, saying I was being dramatic about a minor surgery. And that I was probably partying or dating someone new while Max stayed elsewhere. But Missus Rodriguez kept pressing. It's been four days, Maria. A four year old shouldn't be away.

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently in just her school clothes, no coat, tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out, he said. I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key, Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected, sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning. I told her actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's Pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full while bulging at the seams. Her favourite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me, nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter. Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever, but I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years, the man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me. He Picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear, from rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialed a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine. It's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed months ago? File everything Tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my daughter. I hit another number. Dad, it's happening. Can you come get us? Bring the truck, Caroline. You can't just take her. Jonathan jumped up from the couch. I smiled.

Full of rage, my sister Maggie called me over to discuss bridesmaid duties. Instead, she sat me down. Kylie, you can't be my maid of honour anymore. What? Why? It's about the look I'm going for. My photographer cost $5,000. She avoided my eyes. You're just not bridesmaid material. You don't photograph well. Are you saying I'm not pretty enough for your wedding? I need bridesmaids who fit the aesthetic. Annie, Mallory and Claire all have that classic beauty look. You're more artsy. The cruelty was breathtaking. I still want you at the wedding.

Bridal shower, two hundred eighty dollars. Vegas bachelorette party, seven hundred fifty dollars. The 450 dollar Kitchen Aid mixer, over two thousand dollars. Celebrating someone who thought I wasn't pretty enough, I cancelled the wedding gift order and looked at flights to Bali, a three week trip for exactly two thousand two hundred dollars. Perfectly using up all the wedding money. I booked it that night. The next morning I called Maggie. I won't be Available to coordinate. I'll be in Bali for three weeks starting the Monday before your wedding. You're going to miss my wedding for a vacation. Maggie, you made it clear my presence isn't important. So I decided to treat myself. But you're my sister, important enough to stand beside you. Silence. Have a beautiful wedding, Maggie. I'm sure your aesthetic will be perfect. Bali was magical. I did sunrise yoga, explored temples, Learned to surf and met incredible people. I felt beautiful not because of looks but because of feeling strong, independent, adventurous, posted photos regularly. Each post got more engagement than I'd ever received. Posts were getting 200 likes with friends commenting about how radiant I looked. On Maggie's wedding day, I posted a Sunset Beach photo in a flowing white dress, golden skin, beach waves, genuinely glowing. The caption, sometimes the best decision is choosing yourself. Beauty comes from feeling confident and free. Within 2 hours, it had more likes and comments than anything I'd shared. You look absolutely.

I specifically requested transfers to Lila's college fund account. Whose account is this money going to? I asked. Dad's face crumpled. I don't know. The next morning, dad was on the phone with the bank before they even opened. I sat beside him as he explained the situation to three different representatives, each one transferring him higher up the chain. Finally, a supervisor named Patricia came on the line. Mr. Morrison, I've located the account in question. The funds have been going to an account under the name Lila Morrison Chen. Dad's face went white again. That's not my daughter's name. Sir, according to our records, this account was opened by your wife, Donna Morrison, in 2,018. I watched my father's world collapse in real time. Mom had been sitting at the kitchen counter, but she'd gone completely still. That's impossible, dad said. My wife is sitting right here. Sir, I'm showing Donna Morrison as the account holder and Lila Morrison Chen as the beneficiary. The account was opened with your wife's signature and identification. Dad turned to look at mom. Donna. She stood up slowly, her coffee mug trembling in her hands. I can explain, she whispered. Explain what? Dad's voice was barely audible. Mom sat down her mug and walked toward the front door. Where are you going? I called after her. She grabbed her purse and keys. I need to make a phone call. The door slammed behind her. Dad and I sat in stunned silence. Listening to her car start and pull out of the driveway. That's when I noticed the Manila envelope that had fallen from her purse. I picked it up. It was addressed to Lila Morrison Chen at an address I'd never seen before. Inside were documents I couldn't understand. Legal papers, birth certificates, and a photo that made my blood freeze. It was me as a baby. But I was being held by a woman I'd never seen before. On the back, in Mom's handwriting. Lila's first mother. Goodbye for now. I couldn't fit what happens next in this short video. Watch the rest down below.

Wish I could help. I say genuinely, meaning it. I liked the hollowgate team by 10:45. Marcus, our CEO is calling me personally. Randy, there's been a misunderstanding. Can you come in? No misunderstanding. I was terminated yesterday, effective immediately. Look, maybe Jessica was hasty. We can work this out. Sorry, Marcus, but I can't legally represent the company anymore. I'm not an employee. As a consultant, then. Name your rate. I'm not available. Which was true. I had a phone interview with Drift Shade limited at two PM. Hollowgate's biggest competitor. According to Beth's increasingly frantic texts, the hollowgate team gave Jessica exactly 23 minutes to use the technical documentation they'd specifically flown into review. When she couldn't deliver, they politely excused themselves and said they'd reassess their partnership options at noon. Jessica calls me directly, voice shaking. Randy, you have to help me. This is sabotage. This is consequences. Jeff, I can report you for withholding company information. What information? I took my personal belongings when you terminated me. All official files remain on your servers. Those notebooks contain proprietary data. Those notebooks contain my personal work notes, purchased with my own money. Check my employment contract. She hung up. Two hours later, my wife forwards me a screenshot from LinkedIn. Jessica had posted about exciting restructuring opportunities, trying to spin the disaster as strategic plan. The comments were brutal. Three former clients asking where I'd gone, two competitors offering condolences. Even our supplier in Germany asking If we were still operational by four PM. After a promising interview with Drift Shade, I had my answer to Jessica's sabotage accusation. I hadn't sabotaged anything. I'd taking my knowledge with me when they showed me the door. Monday morning, I accepted drip shades offer. Senior director of client relations. 35% salary increase, equity options and a signing bonus. Wednesday, Beth texted me. Hollowate canceled their contract. They're switching to Drift Shade. Also, Jessica got fired. Marcus discovered she'd been inflating her performance metrics for months. Thursday, my new phone at Drift Shade rang. Randy, this is Tom Chen from hollowate. We heard you joined the team. When can we schedule that technical review? Sometimes the best revenge is simply stepping out of the way and letting people destroy themselves.

Just need someone to drive me home. My sister replied, lol, you actually thought we'd miss Cabo for that. Last month, I was scheduled for minor outpatient surgery, nothing life threatening, but serious enough that I'd be under anesthesia and couldn't drive myself home. So I texted the family group chat, hey, my surgery is on the 12th. Just need someone to pick me up. Shouldn't take more than an hour. My sister Chloe replied instantly, lol, you actually thought we'd miss Cabo for that. Then mom chimed in, don't guilt us. This trip has been planned for months. I stared at my phone, heart pounding. One simple request and I was treated like a burden. After years of helping them out, covering Chloe's car payments, babysitting her kids, even paying half the mortgage. Once when mom said she couldn't, this was the response. All I wrote back was my mistake. I didn't beg. I didn't argue. But inside, I felt 17 years of resentment boiling over. The day of surgery came, I took an Uber to the hospital at 7:00am. The nurse asked, who's your pickup? I. I said flatly, Uber. She frowned but didn't press. When I woke up, groggy and nauseous afterward, I checked my phone. No messages, no good luck. No how are you feeling? Just Chloe's Instagram story, her sipping from a coconut on a beach with the caption hashtag Cabo vibes. I Threw up into the hospital trash can. Nurse Carla rubbed my back. Sweetheart, did no one come for you? They had other plans. Three days later, the hospital called. Hi, Daniel. Just confirming your mom phoned earlier, worried since she hadn't heard from you. We told her you were discharged and went home.

I texted our family group chat emergency appendectomy tomorrow. Need someone to pick up Max from daycare. My sister Amber replied, lol can't. We're literally boarding for Cabo right now. Mom added, ask your neighbor. This trip cost us $3,000. I simply wrote got it. My four year old son Max had been asking all week why Aunt Lily and grandma couldn't help when daddy was sick. I told him they were on an important trip. He nodded seriously and said, more important than you getting better. The drive to the hospital at five am was terrifying. Max's overnight bag was packed with his stuffed elephant and three days worth of clothes. Mrs. Chen, my seventy four year old neighbor, met us at her door in her bathrobe. She's spoke broken English but hugged Max like he was her own grandson. Don't worry, she whispered to me. I take good care. What was supposed to be a routine appendectomy turned into a nightmare. Internal bleeding kept me unconscious for 18 hours. When I I woke up, machines were beeping and tubes were everywhere. The surgeon explained I'd need to stay at least six days for monitoring. My phone had dozens of missed calls, but none from family. Instead, there were voicemails from Missus Chen and her careful English. Max eating good breakfast. He helped me water plants. He very good boy. Day three I was finally stable enough to Facetime Max, sitting at Mrs. Chen's kitchen table, carefully folding dumplings with tiny fingers covered in flour. Daddy! Mrs. Chen teaching me to make food. She says I'm very smart. He held up a lopsided dumpling proudly. In the background, Mrs. Chen beamed and gave me a thumbs up. That same day, my phone rang. Hospital administration. Mr. Rodriguez, your mother called demanding to speak with your doctor about visiting hours. She was quite insistent about getting details regarding your condition. When we explained you'd been here since Monday with applications from emergency surgery, she became extremely upset. I was confused. She called you? Yes. She seems surprised you were here at all. She mentioned something about thinking you were being dramatic about a simple teacher. Thirty minutes later, my phone exploded. Mom? Daniel, why didn't you tell us you were dying? Amber? OMG, I'm literally shaking RN. I had no idea it was serious. Mom, again? We're booking flights home right now. This is insane. I was too weak to respond immediately, but I managed to piece together what happened through a friend who'd seen Amber's Instagram Stories. She'd been posting beach content all week, including a story yesterday of Max eating breakfast at some random Asian lady's house with crying, laughing emojis. The caption read, my brother's parenting choices are wild. Like, why is my nephew at a stranger's house? Elmo. A family friend, Missus Rodriguez from church, had seen the story. And called mom in a panic. Why is little Max staying with strangers? Where's Daniel? Is everything okay? Mom had apparently brushed it off, saying I was being dramatic about a minor surgery. And that I was probably partying or dating someone new while Max stayed elsewhere. But Missus Rodriguez kept pressing. It's been four days, Maria. A four year old shouldn't be away.

I taught 10th grade English, and out of nowhere, one of my best students suddenly just stopped showing up. After a week, someone from our school was finally able to reach his mom and found out that him and his dad got into a car crash and his dad had died. He was out of school for two months, but eventually came back. He was really struggling and always got straight A's before that. So after class one day, I told him not to worry about any of the work because he had already passed the state exam and was a good student. He was really thankful. But a few weeks later, I got called into the counselor's office. I walked in to see him sitting there with his other teachers, and I soon found out he was failing their classes. They were trying to make him do all the work he missed, which probably wasn't even possible. And if he couldn't, he'd have to repeat the entire year. They checked his grades and saw he had an A in my class. One of his other teachers, who I knew didn't like me, started arguing with me, saying I can't just give him a free pass and not let him learn anything. He asked why I was called here, since I wasn't even trying to teach him anything. This was all unbelievable to me. I tried to stay calm. But said, the kid's dad just fucking died. Do you really think your history class matters to him in the slightest? They both just stared at me. The counselor suddenly smiled and said, that's why I called Mister Carter here today. Because I knew he'd say some things I'm not allowed to.

She deserves this opportunity. Grandpa would have wanted this. You owe the family. It was like he thought my property was some kind of family commune he could just redistribute. After a week of constant harassment, I'd had enough. I called my friend Samuel, who's a local police officer and asked him how to get a trespass order. Thirty minutes later, I walked out of the station with legal paperwork in hand. Then I asked another close friend, Peter, to take a road trip with me. I need backup for a family reunion, I told him. He didn't ask questions, just grabbed his keys. It took us 10 hours to drive to Dad's house. I needed that time to clear my head and plan exactly what I was going to say. Peter kept offering to drive, but I needed something to do with my hands while I processed everything. We pulled up to dad's modest two bedroom house around seven PM before we even got out of the car, we could hear a woman screaming inside. Not screaming in fear, screaming at someone. Pure rage. That's probably your sister, Peter said. Sounds like she's having a great day. My friend pulled out his phone, start recording. He said, trust me on this one. I'm glad he thought of it because what happened next was unbelievable. I walked up to the front door and knocked. The screaming immediately stopped. But steps and the Door opened. Dad's face went from confusion to shock to pure terror in about two seconds. He looked exactly the same as I remembered, grey hair, beard, gut, that defeated look in his eyes, except now he looked scared. Here's your family reunion, I said, holding up the trespass order. You abandoned me once. Now I'm returning the favor. Behind him, my half sister appeared in the doorway. She looked rough, unwashed hair, wrinkled clothes, the desperate look of someone who's been fighting losing battles for two long. When she saw me, her face went confused. Wait, your, she started to say, yeah, I'm the brother you've never bothered to call. I interrupted the one who's supposed to hand over his life's work because daddy says so. Dad tried to scam or something, but I wasn't done. Oh, and Dad, Grandpa left me everything because he knew who really cared about family. You know what he told me about you before he died? That abandoning me was the best thing you ever did for me. The look on Dad's face was worth the 10 hour drive. My half sister started crying. Dad's new wife appeared behind them looking mortified. I handed him the trespass order. If any of you contact me again, call my lawyer. His numbers on the back. Peter and I walked back to the car. As we drove away, I can see them all standing in the doorway watching us disappear.

I took my brother shopping for school clothes instead. Your birthday can wait, mom said. It never got rescheduled. By high school, the pattern was set. He'd break something, blame me, and I'd get grounded. He failed every class but got a BMW for his 18th birthday. I was valedictorian and got a card. They skipped my graduation because he felt left out and needed a beach day. I stayed home during college to save money, working two jobs while finishing my degree.

My friend's dad owned a used car dealership and cut me a deal on a blue Dodge Challenger. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. First thing I'd ever owned that my parents hadn't touched. I parked it in the driveway that night, put the keys on my dresser and took about 50 photos, even posted one on Instagram with the caption, earned, not given. Next morning, the keys were gone. So was the car. So was my brother. He probably just borrowed it, mom said. Not looking up. From making his favourite breakfast. You know how boys are. He stole my car. Family doesn't steal from family. Three hours later, I heard the engine. My brother pulled up in my challenger, except the front bumper was dragging, the passenger mirror was gone and there was a crack, spider webbing across the windshield. He tossed me the keys. Your car is junk, bro. Fell apart on the highway. You should get your money back. I stared at the damage. You crashed it. Prove it. My parents immediately sided with him. Dad actually said I should apologize for accusing him of lying. Mom suggested I let my brother borrow it whenever since he's used to nicer cars and did you a favor by testing it. I walked in, died, pulled up my phone and called 9, 1 1. I'd like to report a stolen vehicle that's just been returned damaged. My mother lunged for my phone. What are you doing? Exactly what you do if a stranger stole and crashed your car. The cops arrived in 20 minutes. My brother was smirking until I pulled up the dash cam footage I'd uploaded to the loud. See, I'd installed cameras the day I bought it, not because I'm psychic, but because I park it in a neighbourhood where cars get broken into. The footage showed everything. Him hot wiring it at 3:00am, drag racing down the interstate, t boning a stop sign, laughing as he surveyed the damage, even calling his Friend to brag about teaching me a lesson. The officers watched 30 seconds before cuffing him. This is grand theft auto and reckless endangerment, one said. The damage alone makes it a felony. My parents went nuclear. Mom screaming about family loyalty, dad threatening to kick me out. My brother just staring at me like he couldn't comprehend consequences existed. He's.

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently in just her school clothes, no coat, tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out, he said. I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key, Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected, sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning. I told her actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's Pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full while bulging at the seams. Her favourite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me, nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter. Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever, but I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years, the man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me. He Picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear, from rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialed a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine. It's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed months ago? File everything Tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my daughter. I hit another number. Dad, it's happening. Can you come get us? Bring the truck, Caroline. You can't just take her. Jonathan jumped up from the couch. I smiled.

It's about the look, she said. So I bought a ticket to Bali with the money I saved on her gift. When I posted my trip photos, the comments flooded in and so did her text. Full of rage. My sister Maggie called me over to discuss bridesmaid duties. Instead, she sat me down. Kylie, you can't be my maid of honor anymore. What? Why? It's about the look I'm going for. My photographer cost $5,000. She avoided my eyes. You're just not bridesmaid material. You don't photograph well. Are you saying I'm not pretty enough for your wedding? I need bridesmaids who fit the aesthetic. Annie, Mallory and Claire all have that classic beauty look. You're more artsy. The cruelty was breathtaking. I still want you at the wedding. You can help coordinate behind the scenes. She wanted me as her free wedding planner while prettier friends stood in the photos. That night, I calculated everything I'd spent. Engagement party, $350. Bridal shower, $280. Vegas bachelorette party, 7 hundred fifty dollars. The 450 dollar Kitchen Aid mixer. Over 2 thousand dollars. Celebrating someone who thought I wasn't pretty enough. I cancelled the wedding gift order and looked at flights to Bali. A three week trip for exactly 2,200 dollars. Perfectly using up all the wedding money. I booked it that night. The next morning I called Maggie. I won't be available to coordinate. I'll be in Bali for three weeks, starting the Monday before your wedding. You're going to miss my wedding for a vacation? Maggie, you made it clear my presence isn't important, so I decided to treat myself. But you're my sister. Important enough to stand beside you. Silence! Have a beautiful wedding, Maggie. I'm sure your aesthetic will be perfect. Bali was magical. I did sunrise yoga, explored temples, Learned to surf, and met incredible people. I felt beautiful not because of looks, but because of feeling strong, independent, adventurous. Posted photos regularly. Each post got more engagement than I'd ever received. Posts were getting 200 likes, with friends commenting about how radiant I looked. On Maggie's wedding day, I posted a Sunset Beach photo in a flowing white dress, golden skin, beach waves, genuinely glowing. The caption, sometimes the best decision is choosing yourself. Beauty comes from feeling confident and free. Within two hours, it had more likes and comments than anything I'd shared. You look absolutely

I texted our family group chat, emergency appendectomy tomorrow. Need someone to pick up Max from daycare. My sister Amber replied, lol, can't. We're literally boarding for Cabo right now. Mom added, ask your neighbor. This trip cost us $3,000. I simply wrote, got it. My 4 year old son Max had been asking all week why Aunt Lily and grandma couldn't help when dad he was sick. I told him they were on an important trip. He nodded seriously and said, more important than you getting better. The drive to the hospital at 5:00am was terrifying. Max's overnight bag was packed with his stuffed elephant and three days worth of clothes. Mrs. Chen, my 70 four year old neighbor at her door in her bathroom. She spoke broken English but hugged Max like he was her own grandson. Don't worry, she whispered to me. I take good care. What was supposed to be a routine appendectomy turned into a nightmare. Internal bleeding kept me unconscious for 18 hours. When I I woke up, machines were beeping and tubes were everywhere. The surgeon explained I need to stay at least six days for monitoring. My phone had dozens of missed calls but none from family. Instead, there were voicemails from Missus Chen and her careful English. Max eating good breakfast. He helped me water plants. He very good boy. Day 3, I was Finally stable enough to Facetime, Max sitting at Mrs. Chen's kitchen table, carefully folding dumplings with tiny fingers covered in flour. Daddy, Mrs. Chen teaching me to make food, she says. I'm very smart. He held up a lopsided dumpling proudly in the background. Mrs. Chen beamed and gave me a thumbs up. That same day, my phone rang. Hospital administration. Mr Rodriguez, your mother called demanding to speak with your doctor about visiting hours. She was quite insistent about getting details regarding your condition. When we explained you've been here since Monday with complications from emergency surgery, she became extremely upset. I was confused. She called you. Yes. She seems surprised you were here at all. She mentioned something about thinking you were being dramatic about a simple procedure. 30 minutes later, my phone exploded. Mom, Daniel, why didn't you tell us you were dying? Amber, Omg, I'm literally shaking. RN, I had no idea it was serious. Mom, again, we're booking flights home right now. This is insane. I was too weak to respond immediately, but I managed to piece together what happened through a friend who'd seen Amber's Instagram Stories. She'd been posting beach content all week, including a story yesterday of Max eating breakfast at some random Asian lady's house with crying, laughing emojis. The caption read, my brother's parenting choices are wild. Like why is my nephew at a stranger's house? Elmo, a family friend Mrs. Rodriguez from church had in the story and called Mom in a panic. Why is little Mac staying with strangers? Where's Daniel? Is everything okay? Mom had apparently brushed it off, saying I was being dramatic about a minor surgery and that I was probably partying or dating someone new while Mac stayed elsewhere. But Mrs. Rodriguez kept pressing. It's been four days, Maria. A four year old shouldn't be away from his.

For 18 months, I was the only one who showed up. Every Tuesday and Friday, I drive the 43 minutes to Grandma's house with groceries, medications, and whatever else she needed. I clean her bathroom, organize her pills, and listen to the same stories about her childhood farm for the hundredth time. Brother Caleb lived 12 minutes away. My sister Natasha lived eight. Neither visited unless they needed something. When grandma fell and broke her hip at 86, I took family leave to care for her. I slept on her lumpy couch for three weeks, helping her to the bathroom at 2:00am and making sure she didn't skip physical therapy. Caleb called twice. Natasha sent a get well card. Where is everyone? Grandma asked during her recovery. They're busy. I lied, fluffing her pillows. She squeezed my hand. You're a good girl, Quinn. Don't think I don't notice. When the cancer diagnosis came last spring, suddenly my siblings became very attentive. Not to grandma, to me. They wanted updates, medical reports, treatment plans. They'd called during my lunch breaks demanding to know why I hadn't consulted them about her oncologist's choice. We're family, Natasha would say. We should make decisions together. But when grandma needed someone to drive her to chemotherapy at 6:00am, they were nowhere to be found. During her final month, Caleb visited twice. Both times asking if she'd mentioned updating her will. Natasha brought flowers once and spent the entire visit photographing herself, holding Grandma's hand for her social media look how devoted I am to my grandmother. Her Instagram caption read, I wanted to vomit. Grandma passed on a quiet Thursday morning while I held her hand. She'd been unconscious for two days, but I kept talking to her anyway, reading her favorite poetry aloud. When her breathing stopped, I kissed her forehead and called the hospice nurse. Then I called my siblings. They arrived within an hour, faster than they'd move.

You see the mushrooms help them enter a trance like state where they felt no pain, fear or mercy. This made them terrifying enemies, but often so aggressive that they attack their own comrades. And if a Viking managed to survive multiple mushroom battles, he would often lose his mind and eventually make his way to Valhalla himself. In 2,014, a hacker stole the fingerprint of the German minister of defence from a photo taken at a press conference. With those fingerprints, he could easily launch a missile or access the classified information. You see he zoomed in one of her photos, recreated the pattern and created a digital copy of her fingerprints. That copy he was able to fool scanners, but instead of using it, he simply showed the authorities that the system was not perfect. The sniper hid under a pile of corpses and covered herself in blood during the battle of Stalingrad. She did this because a Nazi soldier threw a grenade at her position and was coming to check if she had survived. To avoid being captured, she pretended to be dead. But when the Nazis got close, she fired three shots, killing three enemies and managing to escape.

But as the robber entered the code and opened the safe, a hidden string pulled the trigger, causing a gun to fire and kill the attacker instantly. You see, this safe had two main codes, one that opened it and another that triggered the gun. And no matter what they did, the robbers could never know if they had the right one. He removed 15 bloody darts from his body during the battle of Hugh. You see, this was known as a beehive round artillery shell. It looked like an ordinary shell, but it had 8,000 metal darts inside. And those darts were fired at the speed of over 2,000 miles per hour and were capable of piercing through bodies and even light walls, making them a perfect weapon for close combat. In 1848, a large iron rod drove through a man's head while he was working on a railroad. It passed behind his left eye and exited through the top of his skull. Should have been a fatal injury, but somehow he didn't die. However, when doctors removed the rod, the man tried to hit them, started kicking and became unpredictable. That's because the rod had gone through the part of the brain responsible for self control. And because it was damaged, his entire personality changed, revealing a darker, more aggressive version of himself.

They approached at an altitude of 15 kilometers, took aim, and dropped 14 bombs with a total weight of 93 tons. Each one of these bombs carried about two tons of explosives, and because of its bunker busting design, it pierced 60 meters of earth and reinforced concrete before reaching Iran's nuclear laboratory and blowing it up. A doctor would point sunlight through a magnifying glass directly at the soldier's wound. he would wait for several minutes while the soldier screamed in pain. You see, when sunlight passes through the magnifying glass, it burns the wound at nearly 930 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing it to cauterize, and since there was no regular medicine available, this sometimes helped them stop the bleeding. He would put a small capsule with poison in the chamber, then carefully connect the trigger to the shutter button. And as a German general would come to a ceremony, the spy would press the button, causing the camera gun to shoot an invisible poison spray that would spread under the skin, leaving only blood stains on the surface. The poison would then gradually shut down the vital organs within minutes, giving the spy time to escape.

My mother hated raggedy. She always said, it's better to be poor and neat than rich and raggedy. I think she Said that because we were poor. Here, wear Drew's good shoes. I hate these shoes, and everybody will make fun of me at school. You've only been going there for a week. You don't know everybody. I was the only black kid at the school. They know me.

You need to apologize to your mother. Why? Because she will make your life miserable. Do you know how many times I've been right and still had to apologize? 469,531 times and counting. How is that even possible? Because she doesn't care. It doesn't make any sense. Exactly. That's the number one rule of living with women. Nothing makes sense. When you learn this, then you'll finally understand what it is to be a man. Wrong or right, you still have to be sorry. I had survived to walk home. Now all I had to do is apologize and my life would go back to normal. So did you talk to him? I talked to him. Good, Chris. Clean up the table and do the dishes. No. Well, it's been nice knowing you, America.

I would like everyone to meet John Callis, who goes by Jack. So Jack here is obviously a Baltimore Ravens fan. And on Sunday, the Ravens beat the commanders. And after the game on Sunday, this viral video was taken where Jack and his buddies are walking down the street saying they're looking for stragglers, basically just anyone wearing a commanders Jersey. And Jack decided to find the two smallest commanders fans who were just standing there doing nothing and knocked this guy out. But he gives this guy a right hook for no reason and started randomly assaulting this other guy in which after the fact he starts flexing and says that I don't fucking lose. And that viral video was even liked by Lamar Jackson. But NFL fans really didn't like this move, so they decided to ruin this guy's life. They first found his Facebook page where it listed his job. And once that happened, everyone else started chiming in with their stories about it. Like this guy saying, I knew this kid throughout high school. He's a total piece of shit.

So this man right here is Shamar Stewart from Texas a M. He was drafted 17th overall by the Bengals this year. But Shamar here is the only first round pick to not have signed his rookie contract yet because the Bengals are trying to shaft him. this dispute happening with Shamar in the Bengals isn't about money. He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term, they can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team and he's actually been practicing with Texas a m. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL cause 1, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible but not likely. No. 2, he could ask.

So basically here's what's happening. This year, Nico was slated to make $2.4 million from Tennessee's collective, but apparently that wasn't enough for Nico and he saw Carson Beck go from Georgia to Florida and he's getting 4 million. So basically stopped showing up to practice and meetings and was holding out hoping that Tennessee would give him $4 million. Long story short, Tennessee said no. I mean, to be fair, Nico, like Tennessee's mascot is the volunteers. He kind of knew what you signed up for. All jokes aside, though, this is kind of an insane move. And to me, the only logical explanation behind this is that Nico's camp just thinks he's not gonna succeed in the NFL. So they're trying to get him as much money as possible right now.

First time offenders convicted of criminal felony copyright violation face up to five years in prison, fines, restitution and forfeiture. And we all know that there is one, maybe two men behind this. This motherfucker right here, Dana White, has been after these guys for years. Even back in 2020, this dude was throwing out threats at press conferences.

And once that happened, everyone else started chiming in with their stories about it, like this guy saying, I knew this kid throughout high school. He's a total piece of shit. Got kicked out of three different Baltimore private schools. And a notable moment was his expulsion from Saint Paul's for putting his hmm. On a kid with special needs.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you want to know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by 4, and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is, Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of it. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man, Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string they got Trey Lance. If you remember a couple seconds ago I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush. And Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt, and although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the snaps, he'll get another 200.

College football season starts this Saturday and one of the games is Delaware State at Hawaii. Now as you can imagine, geographically, Delaware is a pretty far away from Hawaii. And to be exact, it's about a ten and a half hour flight. So Delaware State being smart, they said, hey, we're gonna leave on Tuesday morning. It's ten and a half hour flight to Hawaii. That way everyone could get acclimated, they can get in a routine and we can start practicing over there for our game on Saturday. Well, we got bad news. This Hawaii football reporter said, Delaware State spokeswoman confirms Hornets missed today's ten and a/2 hour flight to Honolulu because of a bus snafu the JFK airport. And clearly nobody has any idea what the hell is going on or what they're gonna do because the spokesperson said we're working on a plane. Now I can't even begin to imagine how hard it is to find a plane that will fit an entire team of football players going to Hawaii of all places. Now, as of this picture, Hawaii is favored by 39 points. And with all of this happening, I'm only going to assume that Hawaii is certainly gonna cover that number.

A website that has saved millions of lives over the past years is now gone forever. As you can see here, the domain has been seized. This domain has been seized by Homeland Security Investigations. First time offenders convicted of criminal felony copyright violation face up to five years in prison, fines, restitution and forfeiture. And we all know that there is one, maybe two men behind this. This motherfucker right here, Dana White, has been after these guys for years. Even back in 2020, this dude was throwing out threats at press conferences. A reporter asked him about piracy and he was like, yeah, we fucking got one. You turn that shit on this Saturday, brother, we got you. And I'm sure the other guy behind it is this dickhead right here. What an asshole this guy is. But in all reality, this probably means nothing because I just looked up stream east again, for research purposes, of course, and they're back up.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you wanna know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by four and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to Cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of him. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the snap,

And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand.

No. 1 is Justin Fields. He's completed 59% of his throws in two years and has the worst record of any starting quarterback in two years. Five and 20 now they got him pieces. Excuses are over. No. 2 is Tua. They were 8 no last year when he was standing upright. Three concussions though last season. Career in peril if he gets another one. Can he stay healthy? At this point, none of us know. No.3 is Russell Wilson. Sean Payton's going nowhere. Russell may be going somewhere. He's got to be better. I don't believe he's washed. I think he rebounds, but he's coming off the worst season in his career and appeared reluctant to play the kind of style he needs to to win. Which is keep moving, bro. No. 4 and he's already minted. But Aaron Rodgers. It's New York, it's a new team. He's a hall of Famer, but there's some pressure here. Hard knocks, high expectations, J. Mac guaranteeing a Super Bowl trip, and No. 5 Matt Stafford, 35 years old. Could blame the offensive line. Did get the Rams a Super Bowl, but I was told they try to redo his contract in the off.

No meddling, no owner for years. I always saw it as a weakness. Now I see it as a strength. Three straight quarterbacks, star, star, star. All three farves in the hall of Fame. Rogers will be and love looks like he's on his way. Think it's a coincidence Aaron Rogers is 4 and 11 and now irrelevant? You think it's a coincidence that Sam Donald is having an unbelievable year and in Carolina in the Jets, he was a tire fire. Aaron could have played earlier. Jordan Love could have played earlier. But if you're just about football, no meddling, no ego, no impulsive crazy person, 37th playoff appearance, No.1 all time for the smallest market in the NFL, surpassing Dallas, who is Jerry's aged has regressed badly and his need.

I think at quarterback, Patrick Mahomes retired today. He's a hall of Famer. I think Aaron Rodgers, I always like better than Farve, is a slam dunk hall of Famer. Travis Kelsey could retire today. He's in. So is his brother Jason. At center, Trent Williams, maybe the best left tackle ever. He is on a short list. Aaron Donald, again, second best interior d lineman I've ever seen to Reggie White and it's close. Miles Garrett and Von Miller on the edge. They just play different and look different. Bobby Wagner has been a nine time all Pro. He's a hall of Famer. And Justin Tucker, the six or seven players to me that look like it's the waiting room. Joe Burrow is just different. He can go toe to toe with Mahomes and he doesn't feel inferior. Justin Jefferson is, is. Randy Moss to me like one of those level players. I think Nick Bosa, the edge for the Niners, Micah Parson.

My family acts like I committed a crime or something. Look, I was overweight my whole life. Like, really overweight. I'm talking about the kind where you avoid cameras at family events and people always feel the need to comment on what you're eating. For years I tried every diet you can think of. Nothing stuck. Then about a year and a half ago, something just clicked. I started walking more, stopped eating junk every night, drank actual water instead of soda. Normal stuff. The weight started coming off slowly at first, then faster. I lost around 90 pounds total. Here's the thing, though. I live like six hours away from my family, we don't really text much, and I barely use Instagram or anything, so they had no idea what I looked like now. I mentioned once or twice that I was eating better, but that's it. Honestly, I didn't want to make a big deal about it because every other time I tried losing weight, I failed. I didn't need my mom asking me every week how it was going or my aunt making comments at Thanksgiving. My sister got engaged last year. I was genuinely happy for her. She's marrying this guy who's actually pretty cool, and they seem good together. The wedding got delayed a few times because of venue issues or something. What? Ended up being scheduled for early this month since I haven't seen everyone in forever. I figured I'd come home two weeks early to help with wedding stuff and just hang out. I showed up at my parents house on a Tuesday afternoon. My mom opened the door and her jaw literally dropped. She just stared at me for like 10 seconds before yelling for my dad. He came over, looked confused, then said, oh, wow, honey, you look so different. It was awkward, but fine. Then my sister walked in from the kitchen. She stopped dead in her tracks. Her face went from confused to angry in about two seconds. She didn't say hi, she didn't hug me. She just goes, are you serious right now? I had no idea what she meant. I asked her what was wrong, and she said, you couldn't have waited until after my wedding to do this? I still didn't get it. I asked her to explain and she literally shouted, you lost all this weight right before my wedding to make me look bad. I was so confused. I told her I've been losing weight for over a year and it had nothing to do with her wedding. She wasn't hearing it. She said I was trying to steal attention and make her feel fat. For the record, my sister looks completely fine. She's gained maybe 15 or 20 pounds since she got engaged, but it's not even that noticeable. She still looks like herself. But apparently this is the first time in our entire lives that I've weighed less than her, and she couldn't handle it. My parents immediately jumped in on her side. My mom said I should have warned them that I looked so different. My dad said it was inconsiderate timing. I tried explaining again that I didn't plan this around her wedding. I didn't even know she'd gained weight. But my sister started crying, saying I was ruining everything and that everyone at the wedding would compare us. She said people would whisper about how the bride's sister looked better.

This shows you're not committed to our team, he said, demanding I clean out my desk immediately. I thanked him for the opportunity and left calmly. Monday would be fun. Lawrence Bennett leaned back in his custom leather chair, tan from his Miami business trip. Four years at Dryfield Robotics, four years watching Tyler Davis get promoted over me despite my numbers being double his. And Tyler took credit for the Westbrook deal I'd spent six months building. Then he got a company car. Meeting invites started missing my inbox, little comments in meetings. Are you sure that's the right approach? Last month, I closed Abbott Manufacturing, $2 million, our biggest contract of the year. I flew to Chicago three times on my own dime, worked every weekend, missed my cousin's wedding. When the contract came through, Lawrence took the, came out for drinks, everyone except me. I found out from Instagram. That's when I asked about my raise. Third time asking, the timing isn't right. Lawrence said, we're restructuring compensation. That night, I updated my resume for the first time in four years. A week later, Vanessa Mills reached out on LinkedIn, former dry field client, now at Ravi. On publishing over coffee, she mentioned they needed someone to head their business development division, someone like me. I took one Vacation day for an interview. Someone saw me in the Ravion lobby and told Tyler. Now, Lawrence sat across from me waiting for me to beg. I understand, I said. His eyebrows twitched. You're terminated effective immediately. Clean out your desk. I stood up and extended my hand. He hesitated before taking it. Thank you for the opportunity. The walk back was quiet. Everyone pretending to be busy, stealing glances. I pulled a cardboard box from the supply room, a coffee mug, some pens, a cactus I'd kept alive for three years, four years of my life, smaller than a microwave. April hovered nearby watching me like I might steal a stapler. I brought in $2 million. They thought I might steal office supply eyes. Tyler stepped out as I headed to the elevator, the man who'd assured me my raise was in process. He didn't make eye contact. Turn in your badge at security. In the elevator, I caught my reflection. I didn't look fired. I looked. Later. I sat in my car for an hour staring at the building where I'd spent four years believing loyalty meant something. My phone buzz. Text from Tyler, sorry about how things went down. I delete, needed it. Then another message. Email from Vanessa, can you come in tomorrow 10:00am? The team would like to meet you. I replied, yes. That night my father said they did you a favor. They showed you exactly who they are. He was right. The raviyon interview. Took 20 minutes. They'd already checked my references, already talked to Abbott Manufacturing. We want you as regional director. Vanessa said, double your dry field salary.

At first, it looked pretty harmless. She was just scrubbing old headstones, showing the names, kind of like honoring people who've been forgotten. But then things started to get different. She began leaving flowers for complete strangers, which was sweet. But the real shocker when she found a child's grave with dolls or stuffed animals. She actually took them home, washed them until they looked brand new, and then brought them back to the cemetery. That's when people started questioning if she was crossing some sort of line. And ever since she's been doing this, weird things keep showing up in her videos. Like one night, she's filming while cleaning a grave, and out of nowhere, a flower just falls right out of the vase. Another time, she left her shovel on the ground, and it moved on its own. No wind, no reason. It just shifted. Now her followers are begging her to stop, warning that she might be attracting something dark, maybe even dangerous, by spending so much time with the dead and handling their things. But at the same time, others say she's just showing respect in her own way. So here's the real question. Is she doing something beautiful, or is she playing with fire? Let me know what you think in the comments.

Missus lock slammed a water bottle on her desk so hard that I actually jumped in my seat. These are banned starting right now. The drinking sounds are disrupting my lessons. She threw the bottle in the trash like it had personally insulted her mother. Our chemistry class was 90 minutes long. No water for 90 minutes in a stuffy classroom. Girl in front raised her hand and said, I need water for my diabetes medication. I watched missus locks eye literally twitch. She replied, then leave class and use the fountain. The girl looked as shocked as I felt. She asked, leave class. Missus locks smiled. If you need water, you leave. No bottles allowed. Anyone who argues gets detention. This was absolutely insane. She wanted us missing actual lessons instead of letting us drink quietly. First, she banned snacks, then bathroom breaks. Now this. A student in the back coughed from the dry air. Missus Locke said mockingly, perhaps you need water, go to the fountain. Then he actually stood up and left. That's when it hit me. She never said how often we could leave. I looked at my friend and saw he was already grinning. I decided to test it first. Five minutes into the next class, I raised my hand and said, I need water. Missus Locke waved at the door without even looking up from her desk. I took my sweet time walking to the fountain. I drank slowly while counting to 30. Then I walked back even slower. The second my butt hit the chair, my friend stood up and said, water. She nodded absently. He left. Three minutes later, another student went another. I noticed her pen had stopped moving. She asked, why is everyone thirsty today? Someone answered innocently, you said we should stay hydrated. Dehydration affects learning. I had to bite my lip to keep from laughing. By then, 12 people had left for water. Missus Locke's face was turning this serving shade of red. The next day got so much worse for her. Two students stood up together and said, we both need water. They were gone for 10 full minutes. The girl with diabetes left four times. Each time, she reminded Mrs. Lock, it's for my medication. The vein and Mrs. Lock's forehead started pulsing. Other teachers started noticing the parade of students. Mr Clark knocked on our door and said, your students keep walking past my classroom. Mrs. Lock's jaw clenched so hard.

My entire family still brings up the babysitting incident from when I was 15 like it happened yesterday. Three neighbourhood kids managed to tie me to a dining room chair with jump ropes and lock me in a closet for two hours while they destroyed the house. The fire department had to come rescue me while the parents stood there horrified at what their angels had done. My older brother filmed the entire rescue on his phone, including the part where I was sobbing and begging to be let out. He still plays that video at every single family gathering while everyone laughs until they cry. Nobody ever mentions that those kids were basically feral or that their parents apologized for weeks afterward. 20 years later at my grandparents anniversary party and nothing had changed. I only show up to these rare family gatherings for my grandparents sake and I definitely don't share details about my personal life with these people anymore. My sister stood up during her toast, holding her wine glass high. Remember when we had to call 9 1 1 because three eight year olds outsmarted our baby sister? The whole banquet hall erupted in laughter. My aunts were wiping tears from their eye eyes. My uncle shouted from the back that I should never be allowed near children unsupervised. My mom leaned over and whispered that maybe I should stick to being the fun Aunt who visits occasionally. Instead of thinking about having kids of my own someday, my dad nodded along and suggested I look into getting more cats since they can't tie anyone up. Even my cousin's new boyfriend, who I just met that night, was chuckling and shaking his head like he'd known me for years. I sat there staring at my untouched dinner plate while my brother pulled out his phone to show the video to anyone who hadn't seen it yet. The party continued with everyone sharing their favourite stories about my complete inability to handle children. My mom told everyone about the time I was 12 and accidentally let our neighbour's toddler wander into the backyard while I was reading a book. My aunt recounted how I was 13 and forgot I was supposed to be watching my baby cousin at a barbecue because I got distracted talking to friends. She made it sound like the child was abandoned for hours instead of the 30 seconds it took for his mom to scoop him up. My other sister jumped in with the story about how when I was 11, I tried to give her Newborn solid food because I didn't understand how babies worked. They were all laughing and toasting to my incompetence with kids while I sat there silently. My brother's wife turned to her husband and said loud enough for everyone to.

I sat there staring at my untouched dinner plate while my brother pulled out his phone to show the video to anyone who hadn't seen it yet. The party continued with everyone sharing their favourite stories about my complete inability to handle children. My mom told everyone about the time I was 12 and accidentally let our neighbour's toddler wander into the backyard while I was reading a book. My aunt recounted how I was 13 and forgot I was supposed to be watching my baby cousin at a barbecue because I got distracted talking to friends. She made it sound like the child was abandoned for hours instead of the 30 seconds it took for his mom to scoop him up. My other sister jumped in with the story about how when I was 11, I tried to give her Newborn solid food because I didn't understand how babies worked. They were all laughing and toasting to my incompetence with kids while I sat there silently. My brother's wife turned to her husband and said loud enough for everyone to.

So I got him banned from the building. So I live in a college dorm, and our entire floor is all girls. I'm pretty much always wearing a bra if I'm going outside or to class or whatever. But, like, if I'm just walking 10 feet down the hall to fill up my water bottle or use the bathroom, I'm not putting on a bra. Nobody does that. It's our floor. We all live here, and half the time, people are walking around in pajamas or. I was going to the shower anyway. So a few days ago, I left my room to go to the water fountain. I was wearing a white tank top and no bra. The tank top wasn't see through or anything, you could probably see the outline if you were looking. I filled up my water bottle, walked back to my room. The whole thing took maybe two minutes. There was a small group of people hanging out in the hallway near some of the other rooms, but I didn't really pay attention to them. The dorm people hang out in the halls all the time. About half an hour later, I hear a knock on my door. I open it, and it's one of the girls from that group in the hallway. I recognized her from orientation at the Start of the year. We talked a few times back then. She had this kind of awkward smile on her face and was like, hey, so sorry to ask you this, but if you go out into the hall again, could you maybe put a bra on? My boyfriend was out there, and he was kind of staring, so. I'm not a confrontational person at all. Like, I hate conflict. I was just like, oh, yeah, sure. Sorry about that. Even though in my head I was thinking, why is that my problem if your boyfriend can't control himself? But whatever. I didn't wanna make it into a thing. So for the rest of that night, anytime I left my room, I threw on a bra or a hoodie. I figured that was the end of it. It wasn't. The next day, my roommate came back from the bathroom and told me she'd overheard the girl talking to her friends in there. She said the girl was making the whole thing sound complete.

My stepmother said, pay us $26,000 and we'll let you in. Your sister needs a vacation. I just nodded and said, understood. Then I walked away. The next morning, she found a letter at the door and started screaming so loud, the neighbors came outside. There's a certain kind of tired that doesn't come from lack of sleep. It sits in your bones, behind your eyes, in that hollow space where energy used to live. That's the kind of tired I was when I pulled into the driveway at 2:00am. I've been on shift for 18 hours straight, not just filling charts. I've done chest compressions on a 16 year old until my arms burned. I pronounced two people dead. I brought one back. I had dried stains on my sleeves and hospital antiseptic buried so deep in my skin that showers didn't help anymore. All I wanted was to laps, maybe eat something, sleep for four hours before my next shift at 7:00am. So when my key didn't fit, my brain couldn't process it. I turned it again, jiggled it, stared at the lock like it might apologize. Then the door opened. My stepmother stood there in yoga pants and a wine stain tank top holding her phone like a weapon. Oh, she said, you're back early. Behind her, my stepsister was sprawled on the couch wearing my hoodie, scrolling TikTok. Her boyfriend who hadn't Worked since moving in, was eating chips. I bought the key. Doesn't work, I said. Right. We changed the locks. Rents gone up. You want back in? $26,000 in back rent plus utilities. Your sister needs a vacation and you're a doctor. You can afford it. She said it like she was doing me a favor. I stood there holding my duffle bag, shoes sticking to the welcome mat. Did dad approve this? She smirked. Your father's overseas. This is my house. When he's gone, I make the rules. I looked past her. My textbook, we're still stacked on the floor. My name was still on the utility bills I paid two weeks ago. But sure, her house understood, I said. I nodded once, turned around and walked back to my car. I didn't slam the door, didn't yell, just drove off into the night. I slept in the hospital call room that night on a plastic mattress with a scratchy blanket that smelled like bleach. And while I slept, they celebrated. My stepsister posted about it on TikTok. Some petty caption about freeloaders learning their place got 12,000 likes. They didn't know was that I've been waiting for this moment for three years. Before my dad deployed overseas, he called me into his office, told me he knew what kind of person Lisa was, said he'd seen how she treated me when he wasn't around. Then he handed me a folder. Inside was a deed transfer, signed, notarized, legal. He put the house in my name before he left, told me not to tell Lisa, told me to keep paying the mortgage like normal, let her think she was in control and wait. I'll show you who she really is eventually, he said. And when she does, you'll know what to do. I've been paying the mortgage for three years every month on time, which meant Lisa had been paying me rent this entire time. She just didn't know it. The next morning, I drove back and knocked once. Then I left an envelope on the doormat. Then I parked down the street and waited. 15 minutes later, the door opened. Lisa appeared in fuzzy slippers holding a mug that said, I want mom. She bent down.

That's why I'm blocking you until I get back. So don't annoy me. I didn't react. But when she came back smiling, expecting me, she wasn't ready for who stood there instead. I'm a private investigator. When my girlfriend Lana announced her Vegas girls trip with friends I never trusted, I wasn't thrilled. Then days before leaving, I casually asked which hotel they'd be staying at. She whipped around like I'd asked for state secrets. That's none of your business. It's a girl's trip. You're not part of it. And I don't want you knowing where I am or what I'm doing. Then came the kicker. You don't get to know what happens on this trip, period. That's why I'm blocking you until I get back so you don't annoy me. Blocked all communication, blackout like I was some stalker. In my line of work, when people throw up walls, you don't beat your head against them. You go around. So I didn't argue. I just nodded, okay, have a great time. Her face flickered. She wanted me to explode so she could play victim. Instead, I left her with nothing. The next morning, I dropped her at her friend Kara's house. Before leaving, she kissed me quick. Don't miss me too much, I smiled. I won't. I didn't drive home to sulk. I drove straight to my office. The boyfriend clocked out, the investigator clocked in. Kara's Instagram showed them in a driveway next to an SUV. I zoomed in, caught the wait, ran it through my database. The vehicle belonged to William Cole, senior partner at a major investment firm, wife, two kids, the whole respectable package interest thing, considering Lana said they were flying budget airline. I pulled flight manifests for every commercial flight to Vegas that morning. No Lana, no Cara, no friends listed anywhere. But a private jet owned by William Cohl's firm had filed a flight plan at the exact time their budget flight was supposedly taking off. Over the next few days, her friends documented everything. Maddie posted poolside photos where I could zoom in on reflections showing men at their cabana. Videos from nightclubs showed Kara leaning into.

That's what happened to one couple down in Cape May last Sunday. Michael ordered his usual appetizer. A dozen clams on half shell. I was down to the 12th one, and when I picked it up with a fork, it looked kind of heavy, but I didn't think nothing of it. And then when I started to eat it, um, I noticed something was in my mouth. I actually thought one of my tooth broke. It was actually a pearl. He's eaten dozens and dozens of clams, and we've never found anything like that. So it was pretty exciting. Not only did something spectacular and rare happen on their impromptu trip, the couple was also celebrating something special. It was actually, um, our anniversary of 34 years. Of coming here for the very first time. So that even makes it more special to, say, Weekend 87. Yeah. The popular restaurant is celebrating its Centennial year. Not a bad gift for the spresslers to walk away with. I have worked here for around 10 years now, and I've never heard of somebody finding one in one of our oysters or clamshells. A whopping 8.8 millimeters. It could go for thousands of dollars. But money is no factor in this equation. I would like to have it set into a nice piece of jewelry, maybe with a mermaid or something nautical.

So I've been with my girlfriend for about two years now. Things were pretty good, or at least I thought they were. She's always been kind of a heavy sleeper. Like, not just normal heavy sleeper, but the kind where her phone alarm can go off for 20 minutes straight, and she'll just roll over and turn it off in her sleep without even knowing. I started waking her up for stuff early on because she missed a dentist appointment once and was super stressed about it. Became our thing, I guess. I didn't really mind at first. Like, yeah, sometimes I'd rather sleep in, but that's what you do in a relationship, right? You help each other out. She had summer classes online this year, which meant exams at home. The night before her big exam, I was in the kitchen grabbing water around midnight when I heard her on the phone with her friends in the living room. She didn't know I was there. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but our apartment isn't that big. That's when I heard her say it. She was laughing and telling her friends how I'm basically her little bitch. Like, those exact words she said. I do whatever she tells me to, and she's got me trained. Her friends were eating it up, too, saying stuff like, good for you and make sure he Knows his place. She laughed and agreed. Then she said something that really got me. She goes, I'm not even worried about my exam tomorrow because my bitch will wake me up and probably have breakfast ready too. I just stood there holding my water bottle, feeling like an idiot. I didn't say anything. I went back to the bedroom and she came in a few minutes later, acting totally normal, kissing me goodnight like everything was fine. I barely slept. I kept replaying it in my head. What? Was I really that pathetic? Did she actually see me that way, or was she just trying to sound cool in front of her friends? Morning came and her alarm went off at 7. Normally I'd shake her shoulder until she woke up. Sometimes took a couple minutes. This time I just rolled over. Her alarm buzzed for like 15 minutes. She turned it off in her sleep like always. Then it went quiet. I could have woken her up. Part of me wanted to, but another part of me was just done. If I'm her little bitch, then she can wake herself up like an adult. I ended up falling back asleep. When I woke up again, it was almost 10. She was standing at the end of the bed literally screaming at me. Her exam started at 8 and ended at 9:30. She completely missed it. Called me every name in the book. Asshole, piece of shit, selfish, immature, She said I ruined everything and she might fail the whole class now because this exam was worth 30% of her grade. I finally told her I heard what she said last night. She went quiet for a second, then tried to play it off like it was just a joke and I was being too sensitive. She said her friends were just messing around and I should have known she didn't mean it. I asked her if she thought it was funny. She didn't answer. She just grabbed her stuff and left to go stay at her friend's place. It's been three days. She's texted me a few times saying I'm being dramatic and that I should apologize for letting her miss her exam. Her friends have been messaging me, too, calling me petty.

Sorry, it's just for close family, Tiffany said through the phone, her voice dripping with fake sweetness. I watched through my kitchen window as my mother in law's SUV pulled into Tiffany's driveway across the street, followed by my other sister in law's mini van and even cousins from out of town. For three years, this has been our Sunday routine. Tiffany would host these elaborate family gatherings while we sat home excluded. My 11 year old daughter Ruby would press her face against our window watching all her cousins play in Tiffany's perfectly manicured backyard. Mom, why don't they invite us? She'd ask. And honestly, I never had a good answer. The solution started small. Oh, we thought you were busy or it was just last minute. But as weeks turned to months, it became crystal clear this was deliberate. Every Sunday, like clockwork, the entire family gathered at Tiffany's house while we watched from across the street like outsiders. That's when I decided enough was enough. Three months earlier, Ruby and I had started a small vegetable garden in our backyard. What began as her science project had blossomed into something beautiful. Heavy cabbages hanging from vines, fresh herbs perfuming the air, zucchini that actually tasted like something. You know what, sweetheart, I told Ruby one particularly painful Sunday. Let's start our own tradition. How about we have our own Sunday feast with Food we've grown ourselves. Her face lit up instantly. Can we invite Miss Hart from next door? She always says hi when I'm working in the garden. Miss Hart was our elderly neighbor who'd been giving Ruby gardening tips. She, I lived alone and often watched with gentle interest as we tended our growing garden. That's perfect, I said. Already feeling lighter. Why don't you go invite her while I start cooking? As Ruby skipped next door, I gathered fresh Cavanato's basil and zucchini from our garden. My husband, Kevin, was away on another business trip. He hated the family drama, but felt trapped between supporting me and keeping peace with his sisters. An hour later, our kitchen smelled incredible. Miss Hart sat at our counter showing Ruby how to fold napkins into flowers, her weathered hands moving with practiced Grace. You know, Miss Hart said, adjusting her glasses. My mother used to say, the best meals aren't about fancy China. They're about the love you put into the food and the joy of sharing it. Ruby beamed, carefully placing her flower napkin on our.

What's what? Dad? Father found $600 in my drawer. I told him the money was earned at the bar. 600 hours you've been saving. What'd you become? A brain surgeon overnight, son? Tell your father where you got the money. Dad, I worked for it. Doing what things? Don't lie to me. Just tell me the truth and I won't get upset. I worked the crack pipes in the cars. What crap games. I told you I wasn't gonna get upset, dad, I lied. Now tell me everything I told you. I worked for somebody and they gave me tips. I knew it. But father didn't want me associated with the mob. He wanted to take me to return the money. What do you mean? Think about, what are you talking about? Well, I mean, we could use the money. It's not here to do something there. We could use it there. We already have it. What's the point? You know where his money comes from. I don't want him to have that kind of money. Just listen to me for a minute. Let's just think about that. That's it. Come on, wait a minute. Listen to me. Father took me to Sunny's bar while returning the money. He told sunny to stay away from me, but I could tell sunny was holding back. For Father's sake, you stay right over here. See, why don't you go outside? I wanna talk to your father. I'll speak to my Own son, Gojo, wait outside. Actually, they both genuinely cared about me. I tell your son to go to school, to go. You don't understand. It's not what you say, it's what he sees. The clothes, it's the cars, it's the money. It's everything. He tried to throw away his baseball cards the other day because he said, Mickey Man will never pay my rent. He said that to you? That's not funny. Not funny when your 9 year old kid has a bigger bank account than you do. I offered you a job but you said no to me. That's right. And I say no. Now just leave my son alone, please. Hey, don't you see how I treat that kid? I treat that kid like he's my son. He ain't your son. He's my son. He's what? He's my son. Hey, get the fuck out of here. I'm not afraid of you. Well, you should be. I know who you are, Sonny. I know what you're capable of. And I would never step out of line. You could ask anybody in this neighborhood who knows me. But this time you're wrong. You don't fool with a man's family. This is my son, not yours. What are you gonna do? You stay away from my son. Get out of here. Before I give you a fucking slap, you just stay away from my son. Go ahead. I don't care who you are. You stay away from my son. Get The fuck out of here. But father's way of teaching made me rebellious, while Sonny's approach was what I preferred. Father just didn't want me exposed to society too early. He wanted me to have a happy childhood if I'd kept that $600. So he was right to welcome me in, isn't it? He's a sucker, dad. He's a sucker. He's wrong. It don't take much strength to pull a trigger, but try and get up every morning, day after day, and work for a living. Let's see him try that. Then we'll see who's the real tough guy. The working man is the tough guy. Your father is the tough guy. I wouldn't learn how to earn money through honest work. After that, they never spoke to each other and I would secretly sneak off to the bar.

A friend invited me to this charity ball. A friend? She's 100. What are you up to? Nothing. I enjoy her company. Older women are cultured, worldly. I've got nothing to be defensive about. Her husband passed away. She appreciates my friendship. I'm providing companionship. Dogs are known for that. I don't like it. Yes. Well, uh, Mr Tucker, uh, it seems your son Jake had some vodka at the school dance and uh, Chris got blamed for it. This, uh, this, this whole situation has just turned his whole life upside down face. Is that a diamond encrusted watch FOB? This. Oh yeah, I've had this. Nobody's owned one of those for 80 years.

You don't wanna mess things up. Well, we'll find out tonight, won't we? Alright, but just one last piece of advice. Remember, listen to her body and respond the way you'd want her to respond to you. Uh, okay, thanks. That's very helpful. You'll be a wonderful lover. Brian, what are you doing? Oh, sorry. You just had a Little something.
