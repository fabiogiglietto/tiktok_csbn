But her face immediately dropped when she realised that we tricked her. My sister in law, Maya, has always been competitive with me since the day I married her brother, Jake. She couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, I tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me. And from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd discuss, she'd push harder. Come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nurse free and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail when she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages desperately searching for any Evidence of our name decision, my husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use first. She wouldn't do that, he said, but I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created blank interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with Final Decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition and I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think, she'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived. The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to her Surprise. The next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness when I walked into her room. She actually had the audacity to say, I hope you don't mind that we ended up using Aurora when she was born. It just felt so right for our daughter. I know you guys were considering it, too. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed her our real pic.

We had the weirdest rule in probably the entire state. No closed doors while changing clothes, ever. Not my bedroom door, not the bathroom, not even the closet. Teenagers hide tattoos all over their body if we let them, dad would say, or they could be hiding pills in their pockets. My friends were horrified when they heard about it. Mickey came over once and watched me change from school clothes to normal one and right in the middle of our living room while dad sat there with his newspaper glancing up every few seconds. That's so creepy, she whispered. And I wanted to disappear. My older brother had already escaped to college partly because of rules like this. I counted days until I could leave, too. Mom tried to help without directly challenging dad. She couldn't change his mind about the rule, but she found ways around it. The shower has frosted glass. I mentioned one day while folding towels, you're only visible as a shadow. She also helped me rearrange my room, putting my full length mirror at an angle where it looked like you could see everything from the doorway, but there was actually a blind spot. Perfect for 30 second wardrobe changes. I got really good at it too. I kept spare clothes in the bathroom and changed when dad was busy watching TV. Mom would create distractions, calling dad to fix something right when I needed to change for school. For weeks, this worked perfectly. Dad thought he was enforcing his rules since door stayed open. He even bragged to his co workers about how his visibility system kept me safe. But then one weekend, everything exploded in ways I never imagined. Dad's colleague Rob came by to drop off work files. Dad was on a video call in his office. Mom was grocery shopping. And I just gotten home from track with my entire body sweating. I couldn't wait for Dad's call to end. So I ducked behind my mirror blind spot like always. But Rob didn't know our house layout. He was looking for Dad's office and saw what looked completely wrong from his angle, a teenage girl while hiding behind furniture to undress. He looked away immediately but asked me a question that sounded oddly serious. Where's your father? I pointed to Dad's office and he took off through the door. I heard him say, Jim, your daughter was hiding behind furniture to change clothes. Combined with these visibility rules you mentioned, dad came out confused at first. She knows the rules about doors. Rob shook his head. Jim, she was hiding behind furniture to change. That is not okay. You're making her feel unsafe the way.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We've known each other since freshman year. And when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything, 50, 50, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird serious face he starts with. So I've been thinking and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. She's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue because honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I Tell her fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realise I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says, okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the t V and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realised she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that.

So I snapped. What I discovered when I got there made me realize I'd raised a monster and I had to choose between my son and doing what was right. When my daughter in law, Emma called asking me to visit, I could hear something was wrong. She just had the baby three weeks ago, but her voice sounded hollow, defeated. I just, I need help, she whispered into the phone. But don't tell Kevin I called you. Red flag No. 1. Why couldn't she tell my son she needed support? I drove the four hours to their house. Immediately Kevin answered the door looking well rested, freshly showered, wearing clean clothes. Mom, what are you doing here? Emma called, I said, pushing past him. Where is she? I found Emma in the nursery, still in the same pajamas she'd probably worn for days. The baby was screaming. Emma was crying. The house was a disaster. Honey, when's the last time you slept, I asked. I don't know, she said, bouncing the baby mechanically. Tuesday, what day is it now? It was Friday. Kevin walked in, eating a sandwich. She's been a little emotional lately, he said casually. Hormones, you know? I looked at my son, my son who I'd raised to respect women and felt sick. When's the last time you held your daughter, I asked him. I held her yesterday, he said defensively, for like 20 minutes while Emma showered. 20? Minutes in a week. Your wife just had major surgery. She needs help. I work all day, he said. I'm tired, too. Emma was back at work. No, turns out Kevin meant his part time job at his buddies auto shop. Three days a week, four hours each. Meanwhile, Emma was up every two hours feeding the baby, doing all the night wakeings, plus somehow managing to keep the house from completely falling apart. I told her she could sleep when the baby sleeps, Kevin said, like he'd solve the problem, but she always finds something to clean instead. I watched Emma flinch at this like she was afraid to rest. That's when I realised what was really happening here. Emma, show me your phone, I said gently. She hesitated, glancing at Kevin nervously. It's okay, I said. Just show me. Her text messages with Kevin were.

My eight year old grandson asked if he could say Grace. As we bowed our heads, he said, god is good, god is great. Thank you for the food, and I would thank you even more if Grandpa gets us ice cream for dessert. And liberty and justice for all. Amen. Along with the laughter from the other customers nearby, I heard a woman remark, that's what's wrong with parenting these days. Kids today don't even know how to pray. Asking god for ice cream, why I never? Hearing this, my grandson burst into tears and asked me, did I do it wrong? Is god mad at me? So, after I assured him that he had done a terrific job and that god was certainly not mad at him, an elderly gentleman approached the table. He winked at my grandson and said, I happen to know that god thought that was a great prayer. Really? My grandson asked, cross my heart, the man replied. Then in a theatrical whisper, he added, indicating the woman whose remark had started this whole thing, too bad she never asks god for ice cream. A little ice cream is sometimes good for the soul. Naturally, I bought my grandchildren ice cream. At the end of the meal, my grandson stared at his ice cream for a moment, and then he did something I will remember the rest of my life. He picked up his sundae. And without a word walked over and placed it in front of the woman. With a big smile he told her here, this is for you. Shove it up your ass, you grouchy old bitch

When my little sister Lena got diagnosed with Ms, she didn't cry. She just looked at me and said, I guess I won't beat you in races anymore. She said it with a smile. Can you imagine a 12 year old girl knowing her body is betraying her and still trying to make me feel better? So naturally I became her personal security guard, walking her to school, carrying her books, telling her dumb jokes to make her laugh on hard days. But I wasn't ready for Jason. Jason was the kind of teenage parasite that grows in a locker room and feeds off axe body spray and misplaced confidence. Captain of the basketball team, hair like a shampoo commercial, rain like overcooked broccoli. I was walking Lena to class one day when she dropped her books. Her hands were shaking. Ms does that. Before I could help, Jason and his buddies walked by laughing. He pulled out his phone and said loud enough for everyone to hear, dude, is she glitching? Someone reboot her. I froze. Lena turned bright red and then Jason topped it off by uploading it to his story with the caption error 4:04, dignity not found. The school took it down too late. The damage was done. Lena didn't talk for 3 days. I didn't sleep for 7. See there this thing people don't understand about revenge. It's not about Anger. It's about patience. And I've got the patience of a monk who's just been ghosted. Step 1, confusion. I got access to Jason's locker. Don't ask how. Let, let's just say the janitor smokes menthols and owes me a favor. Every couple of days. I moved things around, switched his notebooks, swapped one shoe for a size smaller, took out his lunch and replaced it with tuna that had been sitting in my garage for a week. He thought he had early onset dementia. I just smiled when he walked by muttering, I swear I packed my red folder. Step 2, sabotage. Jason took ADH meds. Nothing crazy, just enough to keep him focused. I swapped them with over the counter melatonin. Suddenly he was nodding off in history like a narcotic cat that teachers noticed. They didn't think drugs. They thought he was lazy. His grades dropped. College scouts stopped calling. Shame. Step 3, psychological erosion. Jason lived with his grandma because both his parents peaced out when he was in middle school. She was sweet, the kind of grandma who knits ugly sweaters and gives you those hard candies no one actually buys. I ran into her at the pharmacy, helped her carry her bags, complimented her ugly sweater. She called me a nice young man. I called her Nana. Boom, Instant trust. Then I planted the seed. Jason's been acting a little off lately, huh? Talking to himself a lot. She nodded slowly and said, I've Noticed that, too. She took him to a doctor. The DOC upped his meds. I kept swapping them. The result, he started hearing things, whispering, humming. At one point, he said the school lockers were laughing at him. He punched one, broke his wrist, cried in the nurse's office. Step 4, identity removal. I hacked into a student portal, changed small things, wrong birthday, switched his emergency contact from his grandma to a number I bought at a gas station. Then I forged a school psych report stating Jason might be suffering from dissociation. Next thing you know, Jason gets pulled from class and is forced into a mental health evaluation. He passed barely, but now every teacher looked at him like he was a ticking time bomb. In the final nail, I broke into his room while he was out, moved furniture around, rotated his posters, replaced a photo of him and his grandma with a nearly identical one, but with slightly different outfits. It drove him insane. He screamed at her one night that she was in on it. She cried. He got sent to a psych ward for evaluation. He didn't come back. A week later, his grandma bumped into me outside a grocery store, said Jason wasn't himself anymore. I said, maybe he never was. She just nodded, sighed, and handed me a bag of those disgusting candies. Oh, and Lena, she started smiling again, drawing again, talking again. As for Jason, he went from being The king of the school to being a ghost in a hospital gown who doesn't know if the voices in his head are real. And the best part, he still doesn't know who did it. He just knows someone did that. Paranoia, it'll live rent free in his head until the day he dies. And me, I sleep just fine. After all, some glitches can't be fixed.

My brother is married to Haley and they're expecting a baby together. Last year, I officially changed my first name from Evelyn to indie, which was a nickname form of my original middle name. My parents gave in after realising how serious I was about being indie and how I was not warming up to or growing into Evelyn. My brother and Haley want an older vintage name for their baby. And Haley asked me about five months ago why I disliked Evelyn enough to change it. At the time, she brought up how popular the name has become and how vintage is back. I told her I didn't like vintage names me. They sound really old fashioned. I said the popularity didn't influence my decision. She wanted to know my reason for disliking older names and why I liked something like indie instead. I didn't mind her asking the first time. She brought it up again a week later and asked the same question, pressing more about why. She asked a third and a fourth time. I gave her the same answer and asked her why she kept asking. I told her my answer wasn't going to change. By the seventh time she asked, she admitted she was worried her baby would hate having an older name and wanted to figure out what she could do to prevent what happened with me happening To her, she also said she'd like me to rethink my name because she thought Evelyn was beautiful and she was sad I had chosen something like indie over it. I asked her to stop so many times already and I even asked my brother to step in. He told me I needed to understand it was the hormones. I can easily say she has asked me this more than 25 times by now. I'm not exaggerating that number either. Two weeks ago when she brought it up again, she said she felt I had made a mistake changing my name and that 30 year old me wouldn't be so against Evelyn. I told her 30 year old me can deal with it if that happens. She told me I didn't really have a good reason to like the name indie and that it seems like the kind of name someone young likes but not someone older. Then yesterday happened and I kind of lost my temper. She started asking the same stuff again and the baby is almost ready to be born, so I know it's coming to an end. But she asked me to really think about why and help her because she couldn't figure out what she'd do differently than my parents did. Then she said they really shouldn't have let me change my name so young. I snapped. I told her to stop asking me the same question because my answer won't change. And her comments Are not going to change my mind. I said I don't like old fashioned names. I think they're awful and I'm sick and tired of hearing how much better they supposedly are and having her try to make me find a reason she finds acceptable. I told her just like she hates indie, I hate Evelyn and she needs to let it fucking go already. She burst into tears and my brother got so mad at me. My parents were also like, why did you have to speak to her so harshly?

I've got 5 kids. This is about three of them. Casey, Alex, and Tom. Casey, my 26 year old daughter, is getting married this winter. She's been with her fiance, Max, for about four years now. He's from another country, and with the currency difference, his family can't really afford to contribute to the wedding and also afford the travel costs. So I offered to cover the majority of the wedding expenses. No problem. She's my little girl. I've always dreamed of walking her down the aisle. It was supposed to be one of those proud, emotional dad moments you never forget. Then last week, two of my kids, Alex and Tom, came over with their families. We were catching up, talking about life, and naturally, the wedding came up. I casually asked if they were excited, thinking we'd all be there together for the big day. That's when they both got quiet. They hadn't been invited. At first, I figured maybe Casey hadn't sent out all the invitations yet. Maybe it was some mailing mix up. But then my oldest daughter, who's also there, said she had received her invite already. Same with my youngest, and both of them had been invited with their partners and their kids. So I called my sister to check, and yep, she and her whole family had been invited weeks ago. That's when I Knew this wasn't some oversight. Casey had specifically left Alex and Tom out. Now, here's what makes this even more painful. Alex is non binary and married to a man. Tom is gay, also married with adopted children. And Casey has always been supportive. She stood by them when they came out. She used to call herself their fiercest defender. We're not some rigid, divided family. We're close. Or at least we used to be. So I called her and I asked her why, Max's family isn't comfortable with non traditional couples. It's against their culture. And she hopes I'll understand. Understand? No. Absolutely not. I told her straight up, if she's okay excluding her own brothers, who've done nothing wrong, just to make her fiance's family more comfortable, then I'm not walking her down the aisle. I'm not paying for the wedding either. Let Max's family, with all their backward opinions, pay for it. I told her, if your family suddenly doesn't fit into your picture perfect day, then maybe we're not part of that picture at all. Called me an asshole and hung up crying. My other kids are all on my side. Even my wife, who usually tries to stay neutral, was heartbroken. She adores our son's in law. Loves those kids like they're her own grandkids. She doesn't support Casey's decision at all, even if she's trying to stay open. In case our daughter eventually wakes up and realizes how messed up this Is. But as of now, I'm not budging. I'm not rewarding exclusion and cowardice, and I sure as hell won't smile in a tux pretending it's all okay.

Like, are you even real? Do you spawn in during heat waves just to suffer on purpose? You guys like sleepless nights? You like rolling around in bed drenched in sweat, stuck to the sheets like a slice of cheese left in the sun? But. But. Summer is fun. Fun where? There's nothing fun about feeling like you're being slow roasted while just standing still. Winter. Oh, winter's elite. You're in bed all snug, wrapped like a burrito. The heating's on, the vibe is immaculate, the outside world could be collapsing, and you're inside comfy, watching Netflix with hot chocolate like royalty. And in winter you can layer up. Hoodie, jacket, blanket, socks. Unlimited Protection. You're basically untouchable. In summer you're out here fighting for your life in a vest and shorts, sweating in places you didn't even know could sweat. No escape. Just heat and regret. And don't get me started on how people wanna act extra social in summer. Like let's go outside. Outside? Bro, I walked to the bin and got heat stroke. Why do you hate me? I'd rather be cold with options than.

What thing? I asked, confused because everything seemed present and accounted for. Your thing isn't there. She was staring at my junk with this weird concerned look. I tap my stick on her cheek trying to be funny. I think you're staring right at it. No, not that thing. Hold on. She reached out and started examining me more closely through my boxers and she said the words that ruined my birthday. Holy shit. I think you should get to a hospital. She made me pull up my pants and grab my keys. No explanation, just pure panic on her face. We got in my car and she insisted on driving because I was already freaking out. The whole ride to the emergency room, she kept glancing at me with this worried expression. What's wrong? Just tell me. I was starting to imagine the worst. She grip the steering wheel tighter. There's no easy way to say this, but you only have one ball. What? I actually yelled it so loud. She swerved a little. There's only one ball, one nut, one marble, whatever you want to call it. There's supposed to be two and you've got one. She was talking fast like she needed to get it all out. My mind was racing. How would I never notice this? I've been living in this body for 21 years and somehow missed that I was Anatomically incomplete. My hands were shaking as I tried to process what she was saying. Did it fall out? Was I born this way? What happened to my jelly beans? At the hospital, they took me back pretty quickly. Once I explained the situation, the doctor examined me and confirmed what Sienna had discovered. I definitely only had one testicle. But what he said next made even less sense. According to your medical records, this makes perfect sense. It's all here from the operation. He was reading from his computer screen. What operation? I've never had an operation in my life. I was completely lost. Now, the doctor looked up, surprised. You should probably take this up with your parents, but according to this, you had surgery when you were 7 years old. I called my dad right there from the hospital bed. He answered on the second ring all cheerful because he knew it was my birthday. But when I explained where I was and what I just Learned, his voice changed completely. I heard him say to my mom in the background, honey, he knows I'm gonna have to come clean to him now. My stomach dropped. Come clean about what? What else had they been hiding from me? My dad got back on the phone and took a deep breath. When you were 7 years old, you had testicular cancer. We caught it early and it was completely operable, but they had to remove one of your Test

Your cell phone rings and you don't recognize the number. What do you do? Ignore it. Ignore it. Don't answer it. Not me. I like life. The other day my cell phone rang 9, 1 7. That's a New York number. I didn't know who it was. I picked it up anyway. I hit talk. I said, hello. Guy in the line goes, hey, Bruce, what's going on? My name is Jay, not Bruce. So I said, nothing much, man. What's going on with you? And he said, I'll tell you what's going on. I just got an email about the budget. It's supposed to be 15,000. Now it's 10,000. And I'd like to know what's up. I got excited in my chest. I grabbed the steering wheels like, okay, focus, your name is Bruce. There's a budget. It was 15,000, now it's 10,000. No one's happy about it. That's all we know. That's all we know. So I just repeated back to him what he said to me. And I go, 10,000 is supposed to be 15,000. He goes, yeah, I know. Well, I just got an email and now it's ten. I go, listen, man, I don't know what to tell you. I've been on the road all day. You know, I haven't even seen it. And he goes, did you send this out? I give him some attitude to Bruce. I didn't like it. I said, listen, man, the budget was 15,000. We had a couple extra Expenditures it went up to 16 2 I reworked it, got it down to 14 7 I had 300 to play with so I called it 15 and I sent it out and he goes, yeah, well now it's 10 man and I was like, oh my god that worked that worked phase one complete phase one complete like now I'm in the door. I have a 4:01 k I was at the Christmas party okay, so he goes, did Larry okay this I go, listen man I took the budget to Larry. Larry said it looked fine but I knew it was my ass on the line so I ran it by Jennifer just in case, just a double check. Jennifer said it looked good. I sent it out he goes, yeah, well now it's 10 man and I realized this guy has no idea what's going on over there he hasn't talked to Larry. I know he hasn't talked to Bruce. He doesn't even recognize my voice. I know he didn't talk to Jennifer. I just made her up so he goes, listen man, what are we gonna do about this? And I go, listen, I'm on the road right now. I haven't even seen the email. Why don't you give Larry a call, check in with him, see what he says, call me back just praying he will because that return phone call was going to be amazing and he goes, you know what? Why don't wait? Till you get home, you check the email, you call Larry, you call me back, and I go, nah, nah, bro. Larry knows way more about this than I do. Give him a call, call me back. He goes, okay, hangs up the phone, to which I explode with euphoria because there's a small business in New York that is crumbling to the ground over five grand and nobody can find Jennifer. They're looking, they're looking. I get home, I'm so excited. I take out my cell phone. I'm like, you know what? I'm gonna save that guy's number, give him a call in a couple days, touch base, you know what I mean? Check in, see where we're at, you know? So I save it in my phone under Random Guy. That's what he is. He's a random guy. Four or five days pass, I forget about it. Laying on my couch watching the ball game, phone rings in the dining room table. I get up watching the game, grab the phone, watching the game, look down, random guy.

Um, and I, and I don't think she took them from me. Uh, oh, okay. Uh, alright. First of all, what's your wife's name? Uh, Heather. Okay. How long have you guys been married? Just turned two years. Okay. And these pictures, I'm assuming they were like sexual type nakey pictures. Oh, oh, oh yeah, yeah, they were okay. And you think she's sending them to somebody else? Uh, I think Joe already has. Yeah. You think Joe already has? Okay. Yeah, this is gonna sound really pervy of me to ask, but I kind of need to know what was in the picture but let, let me clarify why I'm saying all this. Last year a guy called us. He found naked pictures of his fiance on her phone and she was sending them, it turns out she was sending them to a girlfriend who works at a plastic surgery place. Like I guess the DOC over there needed pictures of her stomach or something to see if she was a candidate. I don't know. But when we called her up, she basically told us the whole story. So getting back to what you found on your wife's phone, do these pictures look more scientific or are they definitely like sexy time pictures? Oh, no, there's nothing clinical about these pictures. They are totally all about the sex. She's like, she's in the bathtub, she's posing, she's pouting. She's like looking at the camera she's touching herself. There is one with in a like it is definitely okay 100% sexual. Alright, and so keep going. And you said you have no idea who she's sending these to. Well, that's that's why I called you guys. I, I can't I'm finding it difficult bringing it up with her. So yeah, I need to find out. Okay, so the mission today is to find out who she's sending these pics of herself to. Yeah, help. Yeah. You know, she could be putting together one of those sexy photo shoot thingy book thingies, you know, like for Valentine's Day. Has she ever done that before? Anything? Yeah. Yeah. Well, no, well, not for me anyway. Well, do you know if she's mentioned it like have any of her friends done it for their husbands or boyfriends? Um, I, I'm not really sure this is the first I've ever heard of anybody doing that to be exact. But no, I don't think so. I'll bet you that's what it is. Okay. Well, if it is that I'll put my hands up and say I'm paranoid, but I generally don't think that's what it is. Okay, well, let's find out. So this is gonna be tricky cause we have no number right? Like you don't know for a fact that she sent it to some guy and here's his number. No, no, I have no idea who she's sending them to. Okay, shag, let's Let's do this. Get his wife's number, okay? And then text her a message. Something like this. Something like, hey, guess who got a new phone? And then right, here's a hint, I know what you look like in the bathtub. Okay? And then put like hard eyes or winky face, whatever. Let's see what she texts back and then we'll decide what we wanna do from there when we come back. Now let's get to what we texted shag, why you read what you texted to her, to Heather, to Colin's wife. Guys, kind of like what you said. I wrote, hey, guess who got a new phone? Here's a hint, I know what you look like in a bathtub. And then I did the little heart eyes. Okay? And read what she wrote back. Okay? What she wrote back, she said, hey baby, so is this your new phone? Okay, so, okay, so listen, in a sec, I want you to write her back, right? Yes, give me a call real quick, but call me on my work phone and then give her the hotline number so she calls us instead. Okay? Don't do it yet, ash. If she calls the hotline, when you answer, just say this. Say good morning. Thank you for calling. How may I direct your call? Okay? That way she'll ask for whoever she thinks she's calling. Okay, Collin, are you still there?

No, I I was interviewing him for a position at our company. Wait, you were the one doing the interview? Yes. I'm so confused. He said that he just met you at that office and struck up a conversation. You guys went to drinks, had fun, even kissed at the end of the night and now you're not calling him back? He said we kissed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He said that you guys kissed and everything seemed to be going great and he was surprised that you didn't want to go on another date with him. Oh my God. He even went into like graphic detail about the kiss that how it was wet and you licked your lips. Jesus Christ. I okay, look, so wait, you didn't kiss him? No, there is no way. No, absolutely not. Let me just tell you what actually happened cause this is this is bizarre. Okay. I'm I'm tired of hearing all this stuff. Okay, look, this young man Luke came in for a job interview, brought him into my office, sat down, interviewed. We went over his resume. He was kind of fidgety. He was kind of acting a little strange and I sent Him on his way. And in the last couple days, I've been getting flooded with emails, phone calls, messages asking about the job. Oh, my God. So, so you didn't even hire him? No, he has not been hired. He told us differently. What was he like in the job interview? He was just kind of all over the place. You know, he, he just wasn't an ideal candidate. I don't know. He was acting strange. Maybe he was stoned. I don't know. Stoned? Come on. What is happening? That is Luke. He was actually on the other night listening to this conversation and wants to talk to you.

Apparently this dude hates Carrie and she has no idea why. He moved in just a little bit ago. She's been trying to introduce herself to him cause she also thinks that he's cute. She waved at him a few times. He's just ignored her. She walked up to his door to try to say hi and he just shut it in her face. And then she made him some cookies, left it on his porch with a little note. He walked outside, stomped out the cookies and then kicked the plate. And she has no idea why this guy doesn't like her so much. she got a hold of the homeowner association and got his phone number and now she's about to call him and see if she can figure it out. Alright, Carrie, are you ready to go? Yep, let's do it, guy. Are you sure you wanna do this? Are you just the type of person who can't stand when somebody doesn't like you? I mean, it's not that I can't stand someone not liking me, but I want people to be decent with me. You know what I mean? Okay. Like at least treat me like a human being. Are you angry with him over the cookie incident? A little Bit I mean it took me a lot of time to make those cookies and I like that plate that's completely shattered now. So yeah, he did ruin your plate. Yeah, I wanna know why he would do something like that and why he won't even like acknowledge my existence. Okay, well, my advice I would just start by being polite don't really come at him mean and just see if maybe you can figure out why he doesn't like you and don't let on too much that you've been staring at him through your windows observing every move he makes because that may put him off. Okay. Alright, I'm gonna dial his phone number right now and then you can make your awkward Tuesday phone call. Are you ready? Hurry up. Okay, here we go. Hello. Hi. Is this Matthew? Uh, yes, it is. Who's this? Hi, my name is Carrie. I'm your neighbor from across the way. Uh, hi. Hi. Um, can I help you? Yeah, I'm sorry. I just wanted to call cause I've seen you around and I thought maybe I could introduce myself and maybe you know get to know you better. Yeah, no, I mean, I guess that's a nice thing to do. I mean it's good to get to know your neighbors. Um, yeah, I mean, where did you come from? Where where did you move from? Oh, um, you know, I actually I just moved from kind of like a few blocks Away. I'm just, you know, I, this is a better deal. Um, but, uh, how long have you lived in the neighborhood? I've been here for like a couple years. I'm the neighbor who lives across the street from you, in case you're curious. Yeah. No, that's good. Good for you. That's good. That's great. Um, you sound really nice. Um, thank you. I think I, uh, you know, try to be a nice person. Uh, can I ask you a question? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Well, I just had this kind of feeling from our interactions that we've had that you don't really like me and I want to know why. Like, what did I do? What interactions have we had? I don't, I don't even know who you are. I mean, you know, you've seen me. There have been times we both have been out of the house and you've been mean to me and I just don't really know what I did that would, you know, instigate that I've been mean to you. How have I been mean to you? I mean, I waved at you and you completely ignored me. And I don't know if you remember this, but, uh, a while back I was walking up to your porch when you were there and you stood up, looked at me and then just turned around and closed the door in my face. Oh my God. Did we know each other or something in college? Like, do We work together. Oh, man. I, I just, I wanna know. It's been eating me up. I'm, I really sorry that I, you know, inadvertently. I mean, I don't understand why you're laughing. I'm not laughing at you. I'm just laughing at the situation. Um, there's actually a pretty good explanation for all of this.

You're fired. I left quietly without making a scene, then told my husband to just smiled. Four hours later, panic broke out, 98 missed calls. I've been the head chef at Romano's for three years. When I started, it was a struggling family restaurant with two star reviews and empty tables. I transformed everything, rebuilt the menu, trained the staff, forced local ingredients. Within a year, we were booked solid with a waiting list. But when old Mister Romano died last spring, everything changed. His son Giovanni inherited the place and he had different ideas. Cut costs, use frozen ingredients, fire half the kitchen staff. People can't tell the difference anyway, he'd say, counting receipts. While I fought to maintain the standards that built our reputation, I refused to compromise our lamb. Also buco was legendary. Our house made pasta brought people from three states over. I wasn't about to ruin that for Giovanni's profit margins. So on my 32nd birthday, after our biggest week ever, he called me into the cramped office above the dining room. Birthday balloons from the staff still hung in the kitchen below. Here's my surprise for you, he said with this smug grin. You're fired effective immediately. You're too difficult to work with. I stood there, soft stained apron still tied around my waist, watching him lean back in his father's old chair like he just solved World hunger. I didn't argue, didn't cry, just untied my apron, set it on his desk and walked out past the confused prep cooks who'd worked under me for years. The drive home felt endless. Three years of my life gone. My reputation, my team, my recipes all handed over to someone who thought ketchup was a vegetable. My husband, Scott was waiting in our kitchen with a bottle of wine and that knowing smile he gets when he's up to something. How did the birth a shift go, he asked. Already pouring two glasses. Terrible. Giovanni fired me. His grin widened. Perfect timing. What do you mean perfect timing? I just lost my job. We have a mortgage, Scott bills. He pulled out his laptop, fingers dancing across the key board. Remember that food critic from the times who came in last month, Julia Chen, the one who wrote that amazing review about your lamb dish? Yeah, of course. She said it was transcendent. Why? Well, Scott said, turning the screen toward me, she's been discreetly asking around town about hiring a private chef for her daughter's wedding next weekend. Very exclusive, very high paying. I may have already told her you'd be available. I stared at the email thread. Julia had been trying to reach me for weeks, but Giovanni never passed along messages. She was offering $15,000 for a single event, more than I made in three months at Romano's. Scott, how did you, my phone buzz Text message, then another. Then it started ringing. Giovanni's number flashed on the screen. I let it go to voicemail. Then more calls. The assistant manager, the sous chef, even the dishwasher. By the time I checked, there were 47 missed calls. And count, Scott was refreshing his laptop cackling. Oh, this is beautiful. Look, a skating review had just gone live on every major food blog and review site, posted an hour ago, right around when Giovanni would have been running dinner service without me. Romano's Restaurant, a spectacular fall from Grace, read the headline. The review was brutal. Food quality has completely collapsed, undercooked chicken, rude service. Avoid at all costs.

In my family, skinny daughters were worthless, and fat daughters were currency. The heavier you were, the higher your bride price. Every girl at 13 got sent to the fattening house for a minimum of two years. Where gaining weight wasn't a suggestion, it was survival. I grew up watching my older cousins disappear into that house walking on their own two feet and wheeled out in chairs too heavy to stand. My cousin Amara went in at 115 pounds and came out at 340. She was married within a week to a man who paid extra for her stretch marks. They called them beauty lines. But I saw how she gasped for air walking to her own wedding. The process was simple. Six meals a day, each one monitored by the house mothers. You sat in a circle while they ladled bowls of crushed millet mixed with butter, sugar and milk down your throat. If you threw up, they'd make you eat the vomit. Waste nothing, gain everything, my aunt would say cheerfully, while girls cried into their bowls. 4,000 calories per meal, minimum. They had tricks to make you hungrier. Salt baths that made you retain water, medications that increased appetite. Exercise was forbidden, except for throat stretches to help you swallow faster. My sister Kayla tried doing squats in secret. They caught her and force fed her until her stomach. Nearly as punishment, she had to eat standing up for a month. I was 11 when I found the death book hidden in my grandmother's closet while looking for Eid money. Names and weights filled three notebooks. Amara, age 22, heart failure, 389 pounds. Fatu, age 19, diabetes coma, 412 pounds. Mariama, age 24, stroke, 445 pounds. Page after page of girls who never made it to third. The weights next to their names weren't just numbers. They were their sale prices. But what really made me sick was the profit column. Beside each death, my grandmother had calculated how much money the family made from their bride price minus funeral costs. Tattoo's death netted the family $85,000. Her husband kept the dowry even though she only lived four months after the wedding. That's when I started planning. I was smart about it. Told everyone I was starting a traditional cooking circle for younger girls to prepare them for the fattening house. We met every Thursday in my uncle's garage teaching recipes. But what I really taught was chemistry. The exact amount of salt to retain 20 pounds of water weight for weigh ins. How to make fake fat suits from layered fabric and memory foam. Ways to trigger temporary bloating that would disappear after measurements. We got creative as hell. Practice eating competitions where girls Learned to hide food in their cheeks and spit it out. Later developed a system of herbal teas that lost appetite while making your face look puffy. Made our own weight gain shakes that were actually Just protein powder and laxatives. The house mothers thought we were so dedicated. My genius move was suggesting we document our journey for marriage advertisements. We took photos, but Learned exactly which angles and clothing made you look 50 pounds heavier. Bought a broken scale that added 80 pounds and swapped it during official weigh ins. By the time I turned 13 and entered the house myself, I had a network of 15 girls, all trained in the art of fake fattening. We shared clothes that had hidden weights sewn into the hems. Learned to walk slow and breathe heavy like we were carrying extra weight. Perfected the arm positions that made our pictures look massive. The house mothers praised us constantly. Look how well Alia gains, they'd say, as I stepped on the rigged scale. We became their star students while secretly flushing thousands of calories down the toilet every night. Some girls Learned to throw up silently. Others developed jaw techniques that made swallowing look real.

I was in the middle of texting my friends the road work ahead Vine during math class when the principal coughed over the school intercom, the telltale sign that he was about to make an announcement. Attention all students and staff. No one is to leave their classrooms. Everyone must remain seated until further notice. This is for your safety as much as ours. Usually no one gave an F what the teacher said, but now it was so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. Even missus Peterson stopped writing on the board mid sentence. We heard ambulances outside and she told us to sit in our seats. We were all glancing at each other around the room, wide eyed and curious. Nobody said anything, but we were all thinking the same thing. One of the teachers had died. The red and blue lights flashed across the walls, and we heard screams from the other grades echoing throughout the building. Missus Peterson told us that it wasn't a big deal and we should all be focusing on our studies. But she could barely get the words out from how hard she was hyperventilating, so much so that she didn't even care. As we all started to take our phones out and text our theories into the Snapchat group chat about what was going down, then we heard it. Footsteps running past our door. Heavy ones. Multiple sets I Couldn't help myself. I had to look. I crept to the door and peeked through the window. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops. Get away from the door, Eve. Missus Peterson whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Suddenly, people's bitmojis were popping up faster than a whack a mole game. Maybe someone finally took out Mr. Jordan, the creepy history teacher? Nah, someone definitely just had an allergic reaction. That allergies go crazy. Another one said that maybe someone had taken too much vent. Missus Peterson tried to continue the lesson. Something about the Revolutionary War, but nobody was listening. How could we care about some battle from 200 years ago when someone might be dying down the hall right now? Finally, there was a knock at the door. It was the principal standing beside a police officer. Eve O'Brien, the principal announced. My heart dropped. That was me. Can you come with us, please? Bring your things. I silently got up and followed, not knowing what the f was going on. In the hallway, I could see the paramedics near the gym. One was sitting on the floor filling out paperwork. The stretcher was off to the side. When they brought me into the office, I was faced with my parents sitting on the wooden chairs. Well, my parents are divorced. And I hadn't seen them sit in the same room since I was seven. So now I was really confused. Suddenly, my mom stood up and lunged at me for a hug. I'm so sorry, she repeated over and over. I pushed her off of me. Guys, it's okay. I mean, the

I was driving home from my girlfriend's place around midnight when my car started making this horrible grinding noise. Steam was pouring from under the hood. I pulled over on this empty back road and called Del AAA, but they said it would be two hours minimum. That's when this pickup truck pulled up behind me. Guy gets out and walks over, probably mid 40s, wearing coveralls, like a mechanic. Seemed friendly enough. Car trouble, he asked. Yeah, I think it's the radiator. I said I can take a look if you want. I run a shop in town. He popped my hood and poked around for a minute. Yep, radiator hose is shot, but I got some tools in my truck that might get you home. While he was getting his tools, I noticed something weird. His truck had no license plate, just an empty bracket where it should be. He came back with a toolbox and started working. That's when I saw the inside of his truck through the open door. There were zip ties scattered on the passenger seat, lots of them, and what looked like a roll of duct tape. You know, he said, not looking up from the engine, you picked a real isolated spot to break down. Nobody comes down this road at night. My stomach dropped. Yeah, just bad luck, I guess, or good luck, depending on how you look at it. He glanced Up at me with this weird smile for me. Anyway, I started backing away slowly. Actually, I think I'll just wait for the tow truck. Tow truck. He laughed. I called and canceled that while you weren't looking. Told them you got it sorted out. He pulled something from his toolbox, not a wrench, but a Taser. Now we can do this easy or hard. Your choice. I turned and ran into the woods behind me. I heard him yell, you're just making this more fun. I crashed through branches in total darkness using my phone's flashlight. I could hear him following, breaking through the brush behind me. The light from his flashlight kept getting closer. I tripped over a fallen log and went down hard, scraping my hands and knees. When I looked back, his light was maybe 30 yards away. That's when I saw it.

My mother's boyfriend's always came with a price tag I had to pay. When I was 10, she emptied my savings to bail out her boyfriend, Rick. When I was 13, she sold my computer to buy her boyfriend Louise a birthday present. When I was 15, she used my college fund contributions from Dad's family to pay her boyfriend James's court fees. Each time she said the same thing, you're too young to understand love. Everything changed when I turned 17 and Keith appeared six months after James went to prison. Unlike the others, Keith didn't pretend to work. He moved in after two weeks, immediately pitching business ideas while spending days playing video games as mom worked 12 hour shifts cleaning houses for cash. When grandma died, she left me $40,000 for college and a trust mom controlled until I turned 18. Mom's eyes lit up at the reading. Keith suddenly had weekly business plans, meeting small investments. Mom called me selfish for not supporting Keith's dreams, insisting family helps family. She accused me of not understanding love and sacrifice. Called her, calling the bank about early withdrawal penalties. When confronted, she claimed she was just gathering information for my future. But something felt wrong. Two weeks before my 18th birthday, I called the bank myself. The account was empty. All $40,000 gone. That night I confronted mom. She didn't deny it. Didn't apologize, didn't even look guilty. She just shrugged and said, Keith needed it more than you do. You can get loans, my grandmother's gift, my future, my trust, all sacrificed for a man who couldn't even get off our couch. Mom had chosen Keith over her own child's education. She kept talking and her words got crueler with each sentence. She said, I would understand when I found real love. She claimed she was teaching me that family makes sacrifices. Then she said the words that changed everything. Given you everything for 18 years, you owe me this. That sentence shattered whatever love I still felt for her. Keith walked in wearing a new gold chain and designer shoes. He smirked and put his arm around mom like he won a prize. That night, I heard them through the wall planning a cruise. They laughed about my reaction to the stolen money. Keith called me a spoiled brat and mom agreed. She said, I've been selfish since birth. I lay there realizing she would never choose me over any man. I remembered her years of tax fraud and her pride in cheating the system. That's when I knew exactly how to destroy her. I spent three months documenting Mom's cash business. I knew all her clients from years of her stories. I wrote down names, addresses and rates. She made at least $50,000 yearly. I found her income notebook and photographed every page. I researched IRS whistleblower programs and Confirmed family members were eligible the reward or could be 30% of collected taxes. I gathered her social media posts bragging about vacations and shopping sprees. I documented Keith's new lifestyle and match the dates to my stolen college fund. By the end, I had enough evidence to bury her in debt forever. I filed the IRS report online with all my evidence showing six years of unreported income totaling $300,000. I included the stolen college fund as additional unreported income. I attached every photograph, every social media screenshot, every documented pattern of Keith's spending. The IRS moved faster than expected because my documentation was thorough and organized. Six weeks later, the audit notice arrived during Keith's birthday party. Mom had invited all their friends to celebrate at her house. She opened the official envelope while everyone watched, probably expecting a birthday card. Her face went from confused to white as she read the letter twice. Her hands started shaking. She excused herself.

Okay, listen. My nine year old daughter Chloe is cute, but don't let the dimples fool you. Chloe is pure chaos in a Disney Channel body. She's funny, sneaky, and I swear she came out the womb with Wi Fi because she knows everything. It started on a Saturday morning. She asked for my iPad. Totally normal. Usually she just watches slime videos or those weird kids prank their parents TikToks. Ten minutes later, she storms into the kitchen yelling, Mom, Daddy's cheating on you! With Pop Tart crumbs flying out her mouth. I almost dropped the pancake pan. I'm like, excuse me. She flips the iPad around like it's evidence in a trial and goes, look, he's calling Miss Candy Babe. And yep, there it was. Text synced from his phone. Hearts, kissy emojis, even a sweaty gym selfie. I tried to stay calm, but she's staring at me like Judge Judy in pajamas. So are be divorcing him today or tomorrow? That night, I checked the iPad myself. Messages, pictures, everything. Dude was out here playing secret boyfriend while snoring next to me like a broken lawn mower. I didn't sleep, just sat. They're thinking my nine year old solved my marriage before coffee. Next morning, we're all at breakfast. He's buttering toast like nothing's wrong. My daughter looks him dead in the eye and goes, so how's your girlfriend? This man choked so hard on his bread. I thought I'd have to call 9 1 1. He stutters. What? Who? What girlfriend? She leans forward real serious and says, the one with cheesecake. The one prettier than mom. Then she bites her cereal like she just dropped a diss track. His face went ghost white. He looks at me for backup, and I just sip my coffee like it's a front row ticket to his funeral. He tries to change the subject, but my daughter doesn't stop. You know, mom deserves better. Should we fire him or demote him to maid? This man snapped, you shouldn't be in adult business. And she goes, then stop texting Miss Candy on the family icloud, dummy. I almost spit coffee all over the table. She said it with that little evil grin, like she'd been waiting her whole life for this. After he stormed off, I sat her down. I'm like, sweetie, you can't just explode people's lives like that. And she goes, why not? He exploded yours first. I had no comeback. She was right. My nine year old was smarter than me. Couple days later, I finally confronted him. He did the whole guilty husband monologue. It was just texting. It didn't mean anything. You're overreacting. And I just pulled out the screenshots my daughter saved. Yes, saved. She made a whole photo album labelled dad the liar. She even added little captions like Cotton 4K at eight thirty two PM. This child is an FBI agent in Light up sneakers. He started packing that night. Suitcase wide open, socks flying everywhere. My daughter sat on the couch, swinging her legs, eating Doritos, and shouted, Bye, Felicia! I almost died laughing. He glared at her, but what was he gonna do? Ground her for exposing him? Please. And here's the thing. My daughter didn't even stop there. Two days later, when he came by to talk, she opened the door, looked him up and down, and yelled, mom! The trash took itself out. Slammed the door right in his face. I had to go hide in the bathroom because I was laughing so hard, I couldn't breathe. So, yeah, my life flipped upside down. But my daughter turned into my partner in crime. She's wild, she's loud, and she's the reason I didn't stay with a liar. A week later, Miss Candy texted me, sorry, didn't know he was married. And before I could even reply, Chloe grabbed my phone and wrote back, it's okay, girl. We divorced him. You want custody every other weekend. I swear, I screamed.

She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail. When she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages, desperately searching for any evidence of Our name decision. My husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use it first. She wouldn't do that, he said, but I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created bacon interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with final decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya I came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition. And I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think? She'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived! The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to her Surprise! The next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness when I walked

My eight year old grandson asked if he could say Grace. As we bowed our heads, he said, god is good, god is great. Thank you for the food, and I would thank you even more if Grandpa gets us ice cream for dessert. And liberty and justice for all. Amen. Along with the laughter from the other customers nearby, I heard a woman remark, that's what's wrong with parenting these days. Kids today don't even know how to pray. Asking god for ice cream, why I never? Hearing this, my grandson burst into tears and asked me, did I do it wrong? Is god mad at me? So, after I assured him that he had done a terrific job and that god was certainly not mad at him, an elderly gentleman approached the table. He winked at my grandson and said, I happen to know that god thought that was a great prayer. Really? My grandson asked, cross my heart, the man replied. Then in a theatrical whisper, he added, indicating the woman whose remark had started this whole thing, too bad she never asks god for ice cream. A little ice cream is sometimes good for the soul. Naturally, I bought my grandchildren ice cream. At the end of the meal, my grandson stared at his ice cream for a moment, and then he did something I will remember the rest of my life. He picked up his sundae. And without a word walked over and placed it in front of the woman. With a big smile he told her here, this is for you. Shove it up your ass, you grouchy old bitch

So I treated her exactly like I treat my other friends, with boundaries. Tara and I had been together for two years, living together for one. We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer where I was supposed to be her plus 1. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends, get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends but not amazing partners. Here's what killed me, she said. All this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay. You've already got an exit strategy. I said, we're adults, we're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies. Okay, I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. I treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7:00am. Could You drop off my work laptop? Sure, I'll leave it at the front desk of your office. Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. Got plans Monday works better. She didn't like that, but what was she going to say? We're just friends now. Week 2, Tara started cracking. She showed up at the apartment while I was at work, still using her key, helped herself to groceries, did laundry, took a shower. I texted her, I'll need the key back. My friends don't have keys to my place. This is ridiculous. We live together. We used to live together. Now we're friends. Different relationship, different boundaries. She came by that evening, furious. You changed the locks. You no longer live here. Here's a box of your stuff. I'm treating you exactly like I treat my friends. None of them have keys to my place. But I'm not just any friend. According to you, that's exactly what you are. The real kicker came at game night with our friend group. I showed up solo. She showed up with some dude named Connor from yoga, clearly trying to make me jealous. I shook his hand, welcomed him, then needed to destroy everyone at code names while paying them zero attention. Halfway through the night, Tara cornered me. You don't even care that I'm here with someone else. Why would I? We're friends. Friends date people. She couldn't answer because there was no answer that didn't Admit she wanted me to pine for her while she found herself. But the best part, her bestie, Marissa, had been extra friendly all night, kept finding excuses to talk to me, laugh at my jokes. This morning, Tara texted, what was that with you and Marissa? We were just talking. Friends talk. She's my best friend and I'm your friend, too, right? Friends can be friends with each other's friends. By week 3, Connor from yoga had ghosted Tara. Meanwhile, Marissa invited me to a comedy show. The date was fantastic. She was actually hilarious. Something I'd.

Really. I have never heard a girl say that in my life. Hello. Hi. I was looking for Erica. Speaking. Erica, how are you? This is Jubal from Brook and Jubal in the morning. What? My name is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. It's a radio show, 6 to 10 in the morning, moving 9 to 5. How are you? I'm doing well. I'm, I don't really understand what's going on, though. Well, I'm calling you actually because you recently went on a date with a listener of ours. He really liked you. Yeah. But you're not calling him back. So he, he emailed us to give you a call and see if we could find out what the reason is really why you're not calling him back. His name is rich. Oh, yeah. So you, you remember meeting rich? He made an impression. Yeah. Okay. Rich told us about meeting you, had great things to say. He did say there was an awkward moment where you guys are back at his house, you're kind of making out or whatever, and then you got up and left. Oh, my God. He told you all that? Yeah. He didn't, he didn't like go into any details or anything. He just said you guys were hanging out at his place and it went in the bedroom and then you left. That's, that's it, though. Wow. Okay. Um, he hopes that he didn't do something to Scare you or creep you out or whatever. Like he would like to see you again. Is there anything that we can tell him? Um, I just don't. Erica, when we were talking to rich, I said that I think that he's a really weird moaner and like as soon as you guys started kissing, you just started moaning like crazy and you couldn't take it. Am I right? No, no, no. I thought for sure, you know, on that one. Yeah, I thought I did. I thought you nailed it nail on the head on that one. Is it more embarrassing than that? I don't think it's really embarrassing. Um, at least for him, I don't think it is. It was just something happened and I, I didn't know what to do and I just left. Can I tell rich why? Is there anything you can tell me just so I can go back to rich and be like, hey dude, this is the reason. Well, I mean, I'm sorry, I don't know you and I just, I don't even know him that well and, but do you think it's something that maybe he can learn from to not do again? Oh, well, it's, I mean, it's nothing he could change. Oh, so it's, he's stuck with whatever it is. Is it something that you were disappointed in? No, more like surprised, I guess the mean word. What is rich actually, Richard? Is he a woman? Is he a Woman or something? No, far from it. He's far from a woman. Alright, well, you probably like to know that, I guess. Yeah. Um, that's kind of a problem. What? That's the problem is that he's not a woman. He's too manly. No, no, no, not like that. No. What do you mean by that? Well, um, it's just too big. Really? Wow. Are you are you serious Erica? That's the reason you think what it was it was too much. I know it sounds silly or whatever, but like, yeah, I was just once I knew what I was working with, it just became clear she ran away from me. Really? Oh my God. No, Erica, I, I really appreciate you sharing that with us. So you are scared. Scared of what he keeps in his toolbox. The right word really? I just know that it wouldn't work. Oh god, really? Okay, can we get it like a, I don't know, relate it to something? No, that we're talking? I'm dying. I don't need to know Brooke. I don't feel comfortable saying anything more, but probably whatever you're imagining is right. Okay. Wow. Wow. Okay, well, rich is probably gonna be a little upset that you didn't wanna call him back. Really, I think that's the best reason to be turned out ever. That's what I was about to say. She's gonna be very excited to hear that news, Erica. Yeah, thank you for sharing. I should also let You know that rich is actually on the other line right now.

They didn't realize they just declared war on 2,000 bored teenagers with nothing but time and spite. It started when Principal Morrison announced a new policy. Students caught sharing the cool Wi-Fi password will face immediate suspension. The password was 47 characters long, randomly generated every week and only given to teachers. My friend Marcus was the first to strike back. He brought a 30 foot Ethernet cable to cool and plugged directly into the computer lab wall. When Mr Morrison walked by, Marcus was sitting in the hallway, laptop connected, cable sneaking under the door. Marcus, what are you doing using wired internet, sir? The policy only mentions Wi-Fi. That cable is a tripping hazard. I put up caution sign. Marcus had indeed played tiny yellow wet floor signs every three feet along the cable. Mr Morrison updated the policy. No Ethernet cables over 6 feet. So Marcus brought six separate six foot cables and five friends. They formed a human chain, each person holding a laptop connected to each other, passing internet from the lab to the cafeteria like a digital bucket brigade. This is ridiculous, Mr Morrison said. This is compliance. Marcus replied, each cable is exactly six feet. New rule, no daisy chaining connection. That's when Jennifer got involved. She noticed the smart TV in the library was connected to Wi-Fi. She screen mirrored her phone to the TV. Then use the TV's browser to create a hotspot broadcast to her laptop. Jennifer, you're using the school Wi-Fi? No, sir, I'm using the TV's connection. The TV isn't a student. The TV doesn't need suspension threats, she added sweetly. Mr Morrison banned using school devices as intermediary. Alex took a different approach. He stood outside the teacher's lounge with a clipboard claiming he was conducting a password security audit for his computer science project. He'd ask teachers to write their password down to test memory pattern. 3 teachers actually did it before word spread. Alex, this is deception. This is social engineering research, sir. Very educational. Did you get the password? That would be unethical to reveal. Meanwhile, Sarah had noticed something beautiful. The attendance system auto connected to Wi-Fi when teachers logged in. She volunteered as an office aide and memorized the password as it briefly appeared on screen during setup. She didn't share it though. Instead, she sold a service. Bring her device, she'd connect it for you, then change your Mac address so it looked like a printer. By week 3, half the school was showing up as HP Laserjet on the network. Why do we have 400 printer? Mr Morrison asked it. Those aren't printers it, he replied. Then what are they? Creative student. The arms race escalated. Ryan figured out the password was always posted in the teacher's bathroom. Thinking students wouldn't see it there, he used a drone with a camera. During lunch when the bathroom Was empty. The footage was shaky but readable. Ryan, you flew a drone into school property, into the courtyard. Sir, the bathroom window was open. I was investigating ventilation efficiency for my environmental science project. Mr Morrison put curtains on the bathroom window. But the masterpiece came from quiet Emily. She noticed the school's old Wi-Fi routers were still broadcasting, just hidden from the network list. They'd forgotten to change those passwords. She connected to school Wi-Fi 2,015 with the password admin 1, 2, 3 and had faster internet than the teachers. Emily, that network was supposed to be decommissioned. Supposed to be isn't the same as was. Sir, how did you even find it? I didn't. My phone did. I have very aggressive auto connect setting. The breaking point came during standard eye testing week. The online test required internet, so they had to give all students the password. Within minutes, someone had shared it on a paper airplane that flew across the gym. Then another student wrote it in chalk on the trap. A third person trained the morning announcements kid to say it phonetically while reading the lunch menu. Chicken tenders, w 1 f 1 p at SS, mashed potatoes, w 0 r d, green beans 2 dash 0 dash 2 dash 4, chocolate milk, exclamation point, hashtag dollar sign. Mr Morrison called an emergency assembly. Fine, you win. We're going back to open Wi-Fi with content filter. The auditorium erupted. Then Marcus raised his hand. Mr Morrison about those content filters, don't just don't already found 17 ways around them. Of course you have. The next day the Wi-Fi password was, please just use selt responsibly, 2,024. Someone changed it to we promise wink, 2,024. Within an hour, Mr Morrison pretend did not notice. He was tired. The students had won and honestly, their grades had improved from all the technical research they've been doing. Sometimes the best victory is knowing when you've been outsmarted by 2,000 teenagers who turned your security system into their favorite class.

When mom married Garrett, I was 8 years old and desperate for a father figure. My biological dad had walked out when I was 3, leaving behind only a box of photos and unpaid child support. Garrett seemed perfect at first. He fixed our broken faucet, taught me to ride a bike and never missed my school place. But everything changed when my half brother Colton was born. Suddenly, I became the unwanted stepchild. Garrett would buy Colton expensive toys while telling me my allowance was earned, not given. At family dinners, he'd brag about Colton's first steps while dismissing my honorable achievements. When relatives visited, he'd introduce Colton as my son and me as my wife's daughter. The worst part was how he'd punish me for things Colton did. When Colton broke the living room lamp, I was grounded for not watching him properly when he drew on the walls, I lost my art supplies for setting a bad example. Mom never intervened. She was so grateful to have a husband again that she pretended not to notice the favoritism. By high school, I'd accepted my role as the family scapegoat. I worked part time jobs to pay for my own clothes and saved every penny for college. Garrett made it clear I wouldn't receive help with tuition. That money was reserved for Colton's future. Everything changed during my senior year when I needed medical records for a scholarship application. While searching through mom's filing cabinet, I found my birth certificate under father. It listed someone named Pierce Buchanan, not unknown. Like I'd always been told. Pierce Buchanan wasn't some deadbeat who abandoned us. A quick internet search revealed he was a successful architect living two hours away. His company website showed a man with my exact nose and stubborn cowlick. I found his phone number and called, hands shaking first you can and speaking. Hi, I managed. This might sound crazy, but I think you're my father. My name is. Oh, my god, he interrupted. I've been looking for you for 15 years. We met the following weekend at a coffee shop. Pierce explained how mom had vanished while he was deployed overseas with the National Guard. When he returned, she'd moved and changed her phone number. He'd hired investigators, but she'd covered her tracks. Well, I never stopped looking. And showing me a folder filled with investigator reports. I've been paying child support to a state account this whole time, hoping it would reach you somehow. Those unpaid child support checks, mom and Garrett had been collecting them for years. Pierce was nothing like the deadbeat mom had described. He was kind, successful and genuinely interested in my life. He'd saved every penny of child support in a college fund, enough to cover four years at any university I chose. For months, I Kept our relationship secret while planning my revenge. Pierce helped me gather evidence of the diverted child support. We documented every payment, every forged signature, every lie. Father's Day arrived and Garrett expected his usual Celebration. Colton had made him a clay mug.

I had an eight year old diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Without insulin, she'd be dead in six months. I called the mother in to explain the situation. When I, I told her, she was totally relaxed. Oh, I know about the diabetes. The other doctor mentioned it last week. We're handling it naturally, though. No insulin needed. I thought I misheard her. Your daughter needs insulin to live. Her pancreas doesn't work anymore. She will die without it. The mother smiled. We're doing carrot juice therapy instead, 60 ounces a day. Diabetes is just toxin build up in the pancreas. The juice flushes it out. She said it like she was explaining a recipe. I tried showing her the test results. Her blood sugar is 680. She could slip into a coma any moment. The mother stood up and helped her daughter to her feet. Well, thanks for your opinion, but we're good. The carrot cleanse takes three weeks to work fully. We're only on week two. I blocked the door. You can't leave. She's in diabetic ketoacidosis. She needs emergency treatment. The mother laughed. This is why people don't trust doctors. You create fake emergencies. Move or I'm calling security on you. She pushed past me with her barely conscious daughter. After she left, I immediately called my supervisor and hospital legal. We needed an emergency ethics meeting. A child was going to die within an hour. We had social services, the chief of pediatrics and legal on a conference call. The mother had been flagged at three other hospitals. Each time she left when doctors mentioned insulin. I explained the situation. She's giving her type 1 diabetic daughter only carrot juice. The kids in active ketoacidosis. She'll be dead in weeks, maybe days. Legal said without immediate danger, we couldn't force treatment. The chief suggested we call the mother for a formal care meeting, make it sound routine. When I called, she was surprisingly cheerful. Oh, a second opinion? Sure. I love educating doctors about natural healing. She came back that afternoon with a rolling suitcase. Inside were printed Facebook posts, blog articles and a Powerpoint on her laptop she set up like she was giving a business presentation. Let me show you how Big Pharma created the die diabetes lie. She actually had slides. Slide 1, Insulin is made from GMO bacteria. Slide 2, diabetes didn't exist before 1920. Slide 3, every culture has a vegetable that cures diabetes. Chief of pediatrics interrupted. Ma'am, your daughter's blood sugar was 680. She's dying. The mother clicked to her next slide. That's exactly what they want you to think. Look at this graph I made. Couple days later, the school called 9, 1 1. The daughter had collapsed in the cafeteria, completely unresponsive. When they arrived, I recognized her immediately. The orange tinted skin was unmistakable. Blood sugar was 1,100. She was in a diabetic coma. The Mother rushed in 20 minutes later carrying her suitcase of documents. She fainted because they gave her school lunch instead of her juice. That processed food is poison. The kids started seizing right there on the gurney. Foam.

How did you do it? My ex, Ashley, thought our relationship was charity work. Every time we went somewhere together, she'd find ways to remind me I'd never find someone like her again. It started with her introducing me as just a friend at bars. When guys hit on her, she'd let them buy her drinks, then mention she had a boyfriend after. You should see their faces when I point to you. She'd laugh later. The shock is hilarious. The worst was when she just disappeared one Saturday. No text, nothing. Then I saw her Instagram story. Ashley on some yacht wearing basically a string bikini, sitting on some guy's lap while he popped champagne. Videos of her dancing with a bunch of rich dudes, them doing body shots off her stomach. Best day ever. With location tag, Miami Beach. We live in Jersey. When she came back Sunday night, sunburnt and hungover, I was furious. Where the f were you? She rolled her eyes. Tom invited me to his yacht party last minute. It was a networking opportunity. Tom was some crypto guy who'd been dming her for months. You went to Miami without telling me? She laughed, actually laughed. It was last minute, babe. These chances don't come often. When I showed her the videos of her grinding on those guys, she shrugged. It's a boat thing. Everyone was dancing. Don't be so uptight. You're in a relationship, I yelled. Yeah. And I came back, didn't I? She ruffled my hair like I was a child. I could have stayed in Miami. Tom has this insane condo. He wanted to fly me to Ibiza next week. She pinched my cheek. But I came back to Jersey to my little computer nerd, my anxious overthinker who's mad about a boat party. She kicked off her heels and collapsed on my bed. I looked past all these red flags with rose colored glasses until the one year anniversary incident happened. I planned everything perfectly just for her on our anniversary. Flowers in hand, champagne in my car, reservation at her favorite restaurant. I was about to knock on her apartment door to surprise her when I heard voices through her open window. Ashley and her friends, all Instagram model types who made fun of me whenever they visited. Ash still don't get it. Her friend Jenna was saying, why are you with him? You could have literally anyone. I stepped closer to the window, still holding the roses like an idiot. Ashley laughed. You want to know a secret? He'll never leave me, ever. I could do anything and he'd take it. I have complete freedom. I go to Miami. He waits. I hang with my exes. He deals with it. Tom keeps flying me places. Brad takes me to dinner. But this one, she laughed again. He worships me, like actually worships me. But don't you want someone better? Another voice asked. Eventually, yeah. But you know how Brad destroyed my confidence when he cheated with that bartender? This one looks at me like I'm God. He tells me I'm perfect every morning, begs me not to leave him. I need that right now. I heard them all giggling. Once I feel like myself again, I'll find someone on my level. But for now, he's exactly what my ego needs, like therapy but free. They all burst out laughing. I stood there, flowers in hand, and knew something had to change. She needed me for her ego. Time to take away her supply. I spent the next two weeks planning exactly how to.

Because of their regret, I legally changed my name to Atlas when I turned 18. My birth certificate had Michael William Reynolds, Jr. On it, named after my father, who walked out when I was two. For 16 years, I hated being called junior or Little Mike. Every time someone said my name, it felt like dragging around the shadow of a man who decided we weren't worth keeping. School always started the same. Michael Reynolds, the teacher would call. I go by MJ. I'd answer, trying to create distance. Mom worked two jobs after he left. She'd help with homework despite being exhausted, and never complained. Not even when grandparents would say, he looks more like his father every day. As if that was a compliment. When I was 15, mom started dating David. He was nothing like my father. Quiet, reliable, with a dry sense of humor. An English professor who wore sweater vests and collected maps. His first visit, he brought me a journal instead of forcing some guy bonding activity. David never tried to replace my dad. He just showed up. He came to baseball games with his grading work, occasionally looking up to cheer. He helped with college applications and never made me feel like a burden. Once I heard him tell mom, he's not my son, but I couldn't be prouder if he was. Before senior year, I researched name changes. Nothing felt right. Until I Remembered a book David gave me about Greek mythology. Atlas, the Titan who held up the heavens. That resonated when I told them my plan. Mom was supportive, but confused. Why Atlas? She. He asked. Because Atlas carried the world on his shoulders. That's how I felt, carrying Dad's name when he couldn't carry his responsibilities. At least Atlas never put down his burden and walked away. David nodded. Names have power. They tell a story. Exactly. I want to tell my own. After my birthday, I filed the paperwork. Six weeks later, I became Atlas Reynolds. My first college letter, addressed to my new name, is still pinned to my board. Everything was fine until last week, when my biological father called. Mom handed me the phone with a strange look. Junior. How's my little Michael? Junior? My stomach dropped. That person doesn't exist anymore. What? My name is Atlas now. He laughed like it was a joke. That's not your name. You're Michael William Reynolds, junior. Named you myself right before you left. Added, I legally changed it. He said he was changed. Sorry. Wanted to reconnect. He'd moved back to town with his new family, but wanted to make things right with his first son. He kept repeating my old name, like he could force it back onto me. Yesterday, I found his car in our driveway. Mom and David sat stiffly in the living room with my biological father on our couch. Like he belonged there. They ambushed me with dinner. Mom kept giving apologetic glances. David was quiet. My father dominated with stories about his new life, kids and business. At dessert, he addressed the elephant in the room. So you've changed your name to Atlas. Like the MacBook? Like the Titan, I corrected. Well, he chuckled. Time to read.

Our chemistry teacher, Mr. Rodriguez, had this insane rule. If your phone made any sound during class, he'd lock it in his desk for a full week. Not the day, the entire week. Senior year, everyone knew someone who'd lost their phone to him. He kept them like trophies in his desk drawer, grinning whenever kids begged to get them back. There was this quiet kid, Marcus, who worked nights at McDonald's to help his mom pay bills. Twelve year old sister Lily walked home from Jefferson Middle every day through this sketchy area near the auto shops on Fifth Street. She was supposed to text Marcus the second she got home. One Tuesday, during our midterm, Marcus's phone buzzed just once. Text. Rodriguez didn't even look up from his crossword puzzle. Just held out his fat hand. Phone. See you next Tuesday, Mr. Johnson. Marcus went pale. Please, Mr. Rodriguez, my sister should have put it on silent. Your poor planning isn't my emergency. Marcus actually got on his knees, begged. Explained about his mom's double shifts at the hospital, about Lily being alone, about the creeps who hung around that neighborhood. Rodriguez just smiled and slid the phone into his desk. Maybe you'll think twice next time. That afternoon changed everything. Lily never made it home. Some freak in a white van had been watching Jefferson middle for weeks. When she tried calling Marcus first, like she always did. When Scared his phone. Phone just rang in Rodriguez's locked drawer. She was missing for four hours. Four hours of Marcus pacing the McDonald's parking lot, checking the time, knowing something was wrong, but having no way to know what. Police found her behind the Valvoline on Eighth Street. Physically okay, but she wouldn't stop shaking. Wouldn't talk for three days. Marcus came to school the next morning looking like he'd aged 10 years.

He says that she's a marketing person for an account that they're trying to get at work. Okay. And do you believe him?

Does he have any Facebook friends named Holly? Like maybe a new Facebook friend just recently? Uh, I'm not sure. I didn't check.

In our family, when a husband dies, the widow has exactly 40 days to follow him into the afterlife. They called it the Eternal Service. Packed because apparently men needed servants even after death. I was seven when I watched my Aunt Ling drink the ceremonial poison at Uncle Ling's 40th Day memorial. Her hands shook as she raised the cup, but her mother in law held her wrist steady, making sure every drop went down. Aunt May was 23. She tried to run on day 38. Made it all the way to the bus station before Uncle Ling's brothers dragged her back. I remember her begging, saying she was pregnant. They said the baby could serve Uncle Ling too. My mom would brush my hair every night and tell me how romantic it was that wives love their husbands so much they couldn't live without them. But I saw the way her hands trembled. Whenever dad got a cold, I saw her counting his grey hairs. Like she was calculating how many years she had left. Sometimes I catch her staring at the kitchen knives. Not an escape every way, but like she was measuring which one would be sharpest in 20 years. The thing about this tradition was it wasn't even that old. My great grandfather started it after his brother's widow remarried someone younger and prettier. He said it was about loyalty, but everyone Knew it was about control. Dead women can't inherit property. Dead women can't remarry. Dead women can't testify about what their husband did to them. Dead women can't tell anyone about the bruises hidden under their funeral clothes. The ceremonies were always the same day. 40 would arrive and the whole family would gather. The widow would wear white, her husband's favorite dress. She'd serve tea to his relatives one last time. Then they'd bring out the cup. Always porcelain, always with painted flowers. The poison smelled like almonds. They'd make her drink it in front of everyone, then lay her next to her husband's photo until she stopped breathing. Usually it took about 20 minutes. The younger kids were supposed to watch to learn about duty. When I was 15, Dad had a heart attack. That he survived, but it changed everything. Mom started acting differently. She'd wake me up at 3:00am for lessons. First, she taught me how to forge signatures, making me practice Dad's name until I could do it perfectly. Then came the banking stuff. How to transfer money without triggering alerts. How to hide assets in different names. She showed me websites for fake IDS. Taught me which states were easiest to disappear in. Made me memorize bus routes to the Mexican border. Just in case you ever need to disappear, she'd say. But we both knew who really needed to disappear. Then she showed me the videos. She'd been collecting them for years. Any Footage of widow ceremonies from old family gatherings. She had them hidden on an encrypted hard drive labelled recipe collection. She'd pause at certain moments. Look at Aunt Ling's cup. See how it's different from Aunt May's, she'd say. Look at Aunt Lou's funeral. Notice how the coffin is so light when they carry it. Look at how her sister keeps checking her phone during the burial. That's when I Learned about the secret network. For 20 years, widows have been faking their deaths. Some use special drugs that slowed their heartbeat to nothing for 48 hours. One aunt was a nurse who'd been stealing them from the hospital for years. Others had doctor friends who falsified death certificates for cash. There was a whole underground railroad of safe houses in other states where dead women started new lives. They had new name, new social security numbers, new everything. Mom taught me the code words at family gatherings. Such a peaceful passing meant the widow escaped successfully. She fought till the end. Meant someone was suspicious. Beautiful ceremony meant they needed help with documents. The flowers were perfect. Meant they needed money. She's with him now. Meant she didn't make it out. I started helping when I was 17. Creating fake

So who am I actually talking to? I feel like if I told you, it wouldn't be as fun. Plus I will get rejected. So what? Now? I want to play a game with you. A game? I'm down. We keep talking until July. If you know who I am, you decide if we go on a date or not. And if I don't know who you are, then I will not reveal myself. Sure, why not? Just so you know, my eyes are on another girl. She's my crush since 1st grade. Oh, okay. Hiya. I saw you on the bus today. Oh, yeah, you gave that old lady your seat. Wait, you saw that? Who are you exactly? Someone who sees more than you think. Kind of creepy, but go on. Not creepy, just observant. Alright, if we're playing this game, describe yourself physically. Hmm. Should I make it easy for you? Just a little hint? Something I'd recognize, you know, that's fair. Well, I'm very small. I'm blonde and I always wear a pair of red sneakers. I've worn them every day since the start of the semester. Half the school wears red sneakers. Maybe I'll need more than that to be sure. Fair enough. Tell me about the girl you have a crush on. Why do you wanna know? No reason. I'm just curious. I feel like you don't like her already. You will probably do something to her, I promise you. I'm just curious about it. I probably don't know her. Okay. Her name is Ellie. She's a white girl, dresses really well and her smile is just out of this world. She's just gorgeous. Oh, I see who that might be. Wait, do you know her? Maybe, maybe not. Anyways, I'm going with my mom. Talk to you later. Talk soon. Unknown. Haha. Hiya. Have you spotted any interesting shoes lately? Not yet. I've been distracted. Ellie was at the same party as me last night. Oh, and how did it go? It was alright. She didn't notice me much. She was with her friend all the time. Maybe it's for the best.

My fiance Anthony has this whole thing about his morning coffee. Not like a normal person who just drinks whatever is there. No, this guy needs his coffee made in a very specific way or his entire day is apparently ruined. French press only. Water heated to exactly 200 degrees. Four minutes of steam in time, no more, no less. And the coffee has to be this expensive organic stuff from some fancy roaster downtown that cost, like 30 bucks a bag. I've been living with this routine for two years now. Every single morning, I wake up 20 minutes before him just to start this whole coffee ceremony. Set the timer, heat the water, measure everything out perfectly, because god forbid Anthony has to make his own coffee like a functioning adult. But yesterday morning, I was running late for work, my alarm didn't go off, and I had exactly 15 minutes to get ready and leave. So I did what any normal person would do. I made regular coffee in our regular coffee maker. Use the good beans, but just press a button instead of doing the whole French press thing. Anthony came downstairs and immediately knew something was different. He took one sip, and his face went all twisted up like I just served him poison. This isn't how I like my coffee, he said, holding the mug like it personally offended him. I explained that I was Running late and didn't have time for the whole production. That's when he lost it. Started yelling about how I don't respect his preferences and how hard is it to just make coffee the right way. I'm standing there in my work clothes, keys in hand, and this grown man is having a meltdown over coffee. You know how important this is to me? He kept saying, it's the one thing I asked for. I finally snapped, Anthony, it's coffee. It's literally just coffee. And also, it's not the one thing you ask for. You ask for a lot of things. He got all quiet and weird.

When mom married Eric, I was 8 years old and desperate for a father figure. My biological dad had walked out when I was 3, leaving behind only a box of photos and unpaid child support. Garrett seemed perfect at first. He fixed our broken faucet, taught me to ride a bike and never missed my school place. But everything changed when my half brother Colton was born. Suddenly, I became the unwanted stepchild. Garrett would buy Colton expensive toys while telling me my allowance was earned, not given. At family dinners, he'd brag about Colton's first steps while dismissing my honorable achievements. When relatives visited, he'd introduce Colton as my son and me as my wife's daughter. The worst part was how he'd punish me for things Colton did. When Colton broke the living room lamp, I was grounded for not watching him properly when he drew on the walls, I lost my art supplies for setting a bad example. Mom never intervened. She was so grateful to have a husband again that she pretended not to notice the favoritism. By high school, I'd accepted my role as the family scapegoat. I worked part time jobs to pay for my own clothes and saved every penny for college. Garrett made it clear I wouldn't receive help with tuition. That money was reserved for Colton's Future. Everything changed during my senior year when I needed medical records for a scholarship application. While searching through mom's filing cabinet, I found my birth certificate under father. It listed someone named Pierce Buchanan, not unknown, like I'd always been told. Pierce Buchanan wasn't some deadbeat who abandoned us. A quick internet search revealed he was a successful architect living two hours away. His company website showed a man with my exact nose and stubborn cowlick. I found his phone number and called, hands shaking. Pierce Buchanan speaking. Hi. I managed. This might sound crazy, but I think you're my father. My name is. Oh, my god, he interrupted. I've been looking for you for 15 years. We met the following weekend at a coffee shop. Pierce explained how mom had vanished while he was deployed overseas with the National Guard. When he returned, she'd moved and changed her phone number. He'd hired investigators, but she'd covered her tracks. Well, I never stopped looking, he said, showing me a folder filled with investigator reports. I've been paying child support to a state account this whole time, hoping it would reach you somehow. Those unpaid child support checks, mom and Garrett had been collecting them for years. Pierce was nothing like the deadbeat mom had described. He was kind, successful and genuinely interested in my life. He'd saved every penny of child support in a college fund, enough to cover four years at any university I chose. For months, I Kept our relationship secret while planning my revenge. Here's helped me gather evidence of the diverted child support. We documented every payment, every forged signature, every lie. Father's Day arrived and Garrett expected his usual Celebration. Colton had made him a clay mug.

Oh, okay, now hold on a second. Was it last night? Valentine's night? Yes. And he wasn't with you? No. Okay, see, here's what happened, okay? So I asked him last week if he wanted to go out to dinner for Valentine's Day, and he said no. He has to work, right? He's a server. Um, he's. He works over at the pot. So it makes total sense for him to work on Valentine's night, cause, you know, it's huge tip money, right? It's one of the biggest days of the year. Right? Yeah, I was gonna say, I think at that place, it's probably the biggest tipping day of the year. Yeah. So, like I said, I was totally okay with it. No problem. So. But listen to this. I decided I wanted to surprise him. So since we couldn't be together on Valentine's night and we couldn't hang out, I thought I would get him a little gift and then surprise him at work with some flowers. And I got a balloon, you know, just to kind of embarrass him in front of his co workers. You know, I wasn't gonna stay all night. I just thought I would go and surprise him and then take off. Okay, sounds. Sounds like a good plan. So what happened? So I get there, right? And I asked the girl at the front if she can find Brian, and she's Like, yeah, no problem. So she disappears for a while, and she's gone like kind of a long time. And then she comes back and says, well, Brian's not working tonight. He called off. So I'm like, um, no, he's definitely working. Can you please check again? So this girl goes to double check and she's like, no, my manager said he called off this afternoon. So I'm like, hmm. Huh. Alright. So I call him, right? He doesn't answer. So then I text him and I text him, I'm like, hey, are you okay? And he writes right back and he's like, I'm fine, what's up? So then I go, well, I just stopped by your work and they said that you called off. And he text me back, yeah, I wasn't feeling well, so I stayed home. I'm like, alright, so, well, never fear, I'm on my way over. I got something to make you feel better, right? I got the flowers, I got the balloon. It's Valentine's Day. And he text me right back. He goes, no, babe, please don't. I'm not feeling very well. I don't want you to get whatever I've got. Well, that has been going around. Everybody's been getting sick here lately. I mean, we've all had something. And as many of you women want to come over and take care of us when we're sick, it's always a good idea to ask first. Cause like, what if. What if, what if he's got The poops or something, you know, you don't want your girlfriend over to witness that. Well, yeah, but unfortunately for him, I went to his apartment anyway, right, cause I was just gonna leave the flowers and stuff outside his door and text them like, I left you a surprise outside. Feel better. I love you, you know? So I get to his apartment, but his car wasn't there, so he's completely lying. So wait, you went to his apartment anyway? Yeah, like, his work is like two minutes from his house, so I was just gonna leave the stuff for him, but I noticed his car was gone. And the reason I noticed is that he's got assigned parking, so I know exactly where his car goes and it wasn't there. So you think he's lying then? I'm not sure, but I'd like to know where he was. Well, I mean, I actually could have been at patient first. Cause I can tell you from experience, unless you're bleeding on the floor and your face is falling off, it's gonna take him forever to get a room. Yeah, that's true. Well, yeah, I thought about that. Right, but if you're actually there, why not just say, hey, I'm a patient first, you know, don't bother coming by my apartment. Alright, yeah, I. Yeah, that's. That's also true. Let me ask you this. Do you have any reason to suspect him cheating? Like, is there somebody else that you suspect No, not really. I mean, but if he was cheating, it totally wouldn't surprise me. Okay, and I guess that's what you want us to find out for you. I really want to know where he was last night when he was supposed to be with his girlfriend. Of Valentine's Day? Well, yeah. Okay. Alright. Um, but what do you guys think? Any ideas on this one? I mean. I mean, there's nobody else to call. Cause we don't even know for sure if there is somebody else. so maybe we could call and say we're from patients first or something. Well, we don't even know that he went there to begin with. Or we could do our fun game. The Naked Game. Yeah, we call him and ask him who's the last person to see him naked? And, uh, see what he says. We've done that before. Yeah, we could. It's just it's so close to Valentine's Day. Like, it might sound like a setup. Like Lydia is. This is gonna sound crazy, but do you have to know what bank Brian uses? Like, does he have a debit card? Um, yeah, he does. I'm pretty sure it's bank of America. Okay, when you guys go do go out to eat and stuff, does he pay in cash or does he usually use his debit card? Oh god, no, he never has cash on him. Okay, like we went out last weekend and I had to pay for parking because He didn't have any cash, so. Okay. And you said bank of America? Yeah, I'm like 90% positive. Okay, perfect. I think I know how we can find out where he was last night. Stand by. Cause we're gonna need his phone number. Okay. Okay. Okay. So there's a fifty fifty chance of this working. When we come back, either he's gonna look really stupid or we are.

She announced my stepdad bought me a car. My real dad never did anything. I smiled and left. My daughter Rebecca just graduated valedictorian. I paid 340 dollar monthly child support for 11 years. Plus her phone, insurance, dance lessons, everything. Most importantly, I've been secretly building her a 91,000 dollar college fund since she was born. The divorce happened when Rebecca was 7. Her mom Patricia remarried Trent four years ago. This guy who sells insurance but acts like he's running Goldman Sachs. Always posting about his investments on social media. Driving a leased BMW, living in the expensive part of town. Classic fake it till you make it type. But here's what really got to me. Trent had been slowly poisoning Rebecca against me. Little comments like your real dad should be doing more or if I were your father, I'd handle this differently. I heard it through Rebecca's casual mentions, but I figured she was smart enough to see through it. I was wrong. At her party, Rebecca grabs the microphone. My stepdad Trent actually invests in my future, she announces to 50 people my real dad never did anything like this. Trent's grinning like he just won the lottery. My ex wife won't look at me. Everyone staring. My own brother Zach looked like he wanted to punch someone. The neighbours were staring at their shoes. But Rebecca wasn't done. She kept going. I finally know what it feels like to have Someone who cares enough to make grand gestures. Someone who actually wants to invest in my future. Each word was a knife. This was my kid. The one I driven to every soccer practice, ate up with during every fever. Taught to drive in empty parking lots on weekends. I could have listed everything I'd done. I could have mentioned the college fund right there. Instead, I hugged Rebecca, said congratulations, and walked out. That night I sat in my kitchen thinking about what she said. About Trent investing in her future. About him being someone who actually cares. Fine. If Trent wanted to be the real father, he could handle the real responsibilities. I transferred the entire 91 thousand dollar college fund into my personal account. Called my insurance, removed Rebecca effective immediately. Called the phone company, removed Rebecca from my family plan, cancelled her dance lessons that I've been paying for since she was five. Then I did some digging on her new car because something felt off about Trent's grand gesture. Here's where it gets interesting. Plot twist Trent didn't buy Rebecca a car. He co signed a loan with Rebecca as the primary borrower. Monthly payment $340. Exactly what I've been paying in child support. Rebecca's income zero. But it gets worse. The bank had used my financial information as back king without telling me. They'd called my work, verified my employment, checked my credit. Trent had listed me as a financial reference and family support System for the loan. When the bank called for their routine verification follow up, I told them the truth. I'm no longer providing financial support for Rebecca. Her stepdad.

I discovered my wife was cheating when the kids mentioned Uncle Steve. Have been helping mommy feel better at night. The betrayal hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, but I knew staying would destroy me, so I filed for divorce. During the proceedings, I practically begged her to be reasonable about custody. She looked me in the eyes and said, I would never keep your children from you for six months. She actually kept her word, and we fell into this decent routine where we'd exchange the kids every Friday without any drama. She'd even text me little updates about their school days, and we managed to sit together at their soccer games like normal divorced parents. But then I pulled up for my regular Friday pickup, and there was a for sale sign in the yard, and the house was completely empty. I actually fell to my knees on their lawn because I knew she'd done it. She'd actually taken my kids. I called her phone over and over, but it just rang. When I gave up, I noticed the notification for a voicemail that came at 6:00am. Her voice was casual, saying, we've relocated to Seattle for Steve's job, and the kids are already enrolled in school. Like she was telling me about changing their soccer practice time. I sat in that driveway for an hour, dissociating, because she'd been planning on moving 3,000 miles. Away for months while looking me in the eye every Friday. The next morning, a process server handed me court papers claiming I was an absent father who prioritized work over my children. And I realized she'd also been documenting my business trips, kept calling and texting, begging to just hear my kids voices. It actually took three days for me to get through to her. She answered, and instead of explaining anything, she offered monthly video calls like she was being generous.

When I showed him the test results, his face went completely blank. That night, he told me he couldn't handle this right now and that maybe we should postpone everything until you're better. I was devastated, but tried to understand. The next morning, he came over with his parents. Instead of support, they handed me a folder containing receipts for all the wedding expenses they'd contributed. His mother coldly said, since you're canceling, we expect reimbursement. I was speechless. My fiance couldn't even look me in the eye when he said, I'm sorry, but I didn't sign up for this. I wanted a wife, not a patient. He took his ring back and left. I was completely broken. My parents were furious, but focused on helping me through treatment. My sister postponed her semester abroad to be my caregiver. My friends organised a schedule to drive me to appointments. My workplace gave me flexible hours. Three months into my treatment, I received a text from my ex. He'd met someone new and they were already engaged. He wrote, she's everything I wanted. Healthy, vibrant and drama free. I'm finally getting the life I deserve. I didn't respond.

My parents told everyone they had triplets. I was the fourth, the backup child they kept hidden in case something happened to the others. I lived in the basement, watching my siblings lives through security cameras. They'd sneak down at night to bring me food and teach me what they Learned at school. On our 13th birthday, when the others got cake upstairs, they brought me a single candle. Make a wish to get out, they whispered. But how do you escape when you don't officially exist? Basement became my whole world. The day we came home from the hospital, while my siblings got birth certificates, I got a storage room with a mattress. Mom explained it simply. Insurance covers three babies. Four would bankrupt us. But we're keeping you safe down here, just in case. Just in case what? I didn't understand then I watched my siblings grow up on a flickering monitor. First steps, first words. First day of school. They were labelled on the screen. Lily, camera 1. Emma, camera 2. Olivia, camera 3. I didn't have a camera. I didn't have a name. Mom called me spare when she remembered to bring food. The insurance papers were kept in a lock box by my bed. I Learned to read from those documents. Maximum coverage for triplet birth $2.8 million. Quadruplet birth $50,000 total. Beneath that, another paper that made my stomach twist. Rare blood type O negative. Universal donor. Perfect Match probability among identical siblings 100%. My siblings discovered me by accident when we were 5. They've been playing hide and seek. When Emma found the basement door, three identical faces stared at me through the crack. Are you our ghost? Lily whispered that night. They came back every night after that, too. They'd wait until our parents started snoring, then creep down with whatever they could steal from dinner. Olivia taught me to read better. Emma showed me math. Lily brought down her drawings and taped them to my walls. Why don't you live upstairs? They asked. Because I'm the emergency one, I said, repeating what I've been told. They didn't understand. Neither did I, really. Not until Olivia got sick. She was 8 when the doctors found problems with her kidney. I watched on the monitors as our parents pace the living room. We have options, mom said. We've been smart. We've been prepared. That night, my siblings didn't come down. I could see them on the screens, huddled in their room, crying. The next morning, dad came to the basement with a medical kit. Just some tests, he said. Standard stuff. The needle hurt. The blood vials filled one by one, six of them. Then he checked my eyes. My reflexes pressed on my stomach, where my kidneys were. Perfect, he muttered. Absolutely perfect. Olivia got better with medication. The basement door locked from the outside. After that, my siblings started leaving me notes under the door. We're trying to find a way. We won't let them hurt you. You're our sister. Not spare parts. Years passed in that basement. I exercised to stay healthy. Had to keep the spare parts in good condition. Stuff from old textbooks my siblings smuggled down. I watched them go to school, make friends, and live lives. Every birthday, three candles upstairs, one candle downstairs. Same wish every year. When we turned 12, Emma broke her arm so badly, the bone came through the skin. On the monitor, I watched our parents exchange looks. Dad's hand went to his pocket, where he kept the basement key. No, I whispered to the empty room. Please, no. But Emma's arm healed clean. The key stayed in his pocket. The worst part wasn't the isolation. It wasn't eating scraps or sleeping on concrete. It was watching my sister's live. Knowing I existed only as their backup. Their walking medical supply. A ghost child waiting to be harvested. They tried to tell someone. Once. Lily broke down to a teacher about her other sister. The school called our parents. That night. I watched mom explain about Lily's imaginary quadruplet. A trauma response to being a triplet. So creative, so troubled. Therapy was recommended. The lock on my door got upgraded to digital. On our 13th birthday, I sat in the dark, listening to the party upstairs. Laughter, music. The voices of kids I'd never meet. When midnight came, my sister snuck down with a cupcake. They hidden one candle flickering in the darkness. Make a wish, they said. Tears streaming down three identical faces with to get out. We're going to help you. We promise. I closed my eyes, blew out the candle, wished for the only thing I'd ever wanted. To exist. But when morning came, I was still in the basement. Still watching their lives through grainy screen. Still the emergency child despair parts. The ghost in the basement that only three people in the world knew was real. Mom came down that afternoon with the medical kit again. More tests, more vials of blood. Just checking everything's working properly, she said. Can never be too prepared. She paused at the door, looking back at me. You know you're loved, right? We kept you. We could have given you away, but we kept you. That's love. The door locked behind her. The red light linked. At that moment, I knew I had a decision to make. One that would not only change my life, but the lives of my triplets forever. Full story on channel link below.

My daughter had asked to sleep in my room for the third time in a row. She's five, so I assume she was having nightmares, or maybe she was going through a clingy phase. When she asked for the fourth time, I said yes, and as I was tucking her in, I asked why she kept asking to sleep in my room. She couldn't look at me as she told me, because Mommy's friend gets into bed with me when you're gone. Her words didn't fully register at first. I asked her what she meant, and she repeated it, adding that Mommy says it's okay because he's like family. I couldn't sleep at all that night. The next morning, I told my wife what our daughter had said and asked if anyone had been over recently. She brushed it off almost instantly, laughing a little and saying our daughter probably meant a stuffed animal or had made something up. She said, you know how kids are and change the subject. The way she said it was off, as if she was prepared for that question and had her answer ready. A few days later, I told her I had to leave town for a short work trip. In reality, I stayed in a nearby hotel and logged into the security cameras I had installed last year after a neighbor's house had been broken into. I'd almost forgotten they were even still. Active the next day. I got a motion alert around nine thirty PM from the hallway camera. I opened the feed. I saw a man I didn't recognize. He kissed my wife, who entered our bedroom right after. But the man kept walking through the hallway and went straight into my daughter's room. He just walked in like he belonged there. And my wife was fine with it. I was so scared for my daughter. I instantly got in my car and drove straight home. When I walked through the door, I didn't say a word.

When I turned 15, my mom went from strict to straight up paranoid. One night after dinner, she plopped down next to me with this weird smile and said she was installing a family safety app on my phone. I watched her tap away, giving herself access to everything. My location, photos, texts, even my drafts on social media. It's just to keep you safe, honey, she said, handing my phone back like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. It felt like having a stalker who lived in my house. At first I tried to be cool about it. Maybe it would calm her down, right? Wrong. Things got insane fast. She text me in the middle of conversations asking who I was with. She'd comment on memes I hadn't even posted yet because she was reading my drafts. Worst part? She started replying to my friends pretending to be me. My buddy Jake texted asking if I wanted to hang out, and my mom replied, sure thing, buddy! With way too many exclamation points. Jake called me laughing, asking why I was texting like a soccer mom. I had no idea what he meant until I checked my messages. Then came the day that broke me. I was in history class when Mrs. Wilson pulled me aside. She look uncomfortable as hell. Liam, your mother called the school. She's concerned about some message you sent about Me. My stomach dropped. I knew exactly what she meant. I texted my best friend Kyle the night before, joking about how our history teacher's haircut looked like she stuck her finger in an electrical socket. It was just stupid friend stuff, not meant for anyone else. But my mom had read it and called the school to complain about my private joke. I wanted to disappear into the floor. By lunch, Kyle wasn't talking to me. Neither was Jake. Word got around that my mom was reading everything, and suddenly nobody wanted to text me anymore. Some kids even blocked me. It was like my social life had a disease, and the disease was my mom. That night, I stared at my phone, feeling trapped. But then I noticed something. The tracking app worked both ways. It logged every time someone accessed the account. I spent hours studying those logs, and what I found made my skin crawl. My mom wasn't just checking my phone during the day. She was logging in at 1:00am, 2:00am, even 3:00am. She was forwarding my messages to her laptop. She was screenshotting my photos. He was living inside my phone 24 7. So I came up with a plan. I created a fake friend named Daniel, made up this whole persona, gave him a backstory, even found some random photos online to use as his profile pic on a group chat with myself. Then I started a long conversation with Daniel about this Epic party happening at some remote barn outside town. I made it sound exclusive, secretive, like something a paranoid mom would totally freak out about. I mentioned the address random dirt road I found on Google Maps that LED to absolutely nothing. I talked about how it was starting at midnight, how everyone was going to be there, how I couldn't wait to finally do something without my mom knowing. Then I put my phone down and waited. At 1:00am, the app logged that she opened the conversation. At 1:00am, I heard her bedroom Door Creek open. At 1:00am, I heard the garage door at

I've been planning Miranda's dream Valentine's Day for weeks. When she destroyed me over brunch, I just pulled out my phone to confirm the reservation at the restaurant she'd been dying to try, when she interrupted me. God, you're so clingy and needy. We need to talk, she said, pushing away the flowers I'd brought. I can't do this anymore. It's suffocating. You're always trying to be romantic, always wanting to do couple stuff. My heart broke. We're about to be a year, Miranda. Exactly why we need to set boundaries now. From now on, we're best friends who happen to sleep together. Treat me exactly like you treat Nate or will. No flowers or special treatment. Just buddies. I'm just someone you have sex with. She said it like I was pathetic for wanting more. Next to us, looked horrified. If that's what you want, I said quietly. She rolled her eyes. Finally. Maybe now you'll stop being so desperate and embarrassing. Valentine's Day arrived. Miranda texted asking about if we had plans. I responded that I was going to Nate's to watch the game. She could come if she wanted. Dead silence for an hour. Didn't we have a reservation? She finally asked. I reminded her that I don't make romantic reservations for my buddies. That night, she showed up at Nate's in a red dress and heels. Handed her a beer without Looking up from the TV and went back to the game. When she tried to sit next to me on the couch, I pointed to the recliner across the room. Dude, you're blocking the TV! Nate looked confused. Miranda's face went red. She spent the night watching us play video games and talk about sports. Her birthday came three weeks later. I got her what I got all my bros. A six pack of beer and buffalo wings from the sketchy place near campus. Stared at the grease stained container like it was radioactive. Where's my actual gift? She asked, voice shaking. That is your gift. Same thing I got will last month. Pretty good wings, too. But I'm your girlfriend. No, you're my friend who I occasionally sleep with. Your exact words. Didn't speak to me for two days. The real entertainment started at her company Spring Gala. She begged me to come, bought me a suit, and said it was important for her promotion. When her boss approached asking how long we've been together, I corrected him immediately, oh, we're not together. Her boss looked bewildered, but she said you were her boyfriend of 10 months. Nah, she doesn't do the relationship thing. We're buddies who hook up occasionally. She was actually just telling me how suffocating real relationships are. Miranda grabbed my arm so hard it left marks. Her coworkers started whispering. At her cousin's wedding in may, the disasters multiplied when they called for couples photos. I stayed seated, playing on my phone. We're not a couple, just friends with benefits, I explained to the photographer, who asked three times if I was sure. During the slow songs, I was at the bar with other guys talking about basketball, while she stood alone on the dance floor. Her family kept asking if we'd broken up. I explained cheerfully that Miranda didn't want to be together, just friends with benefits. Her grandmother nearly fainted. Her mom pulled her aside for a long conversation about self respect and not letting men use you. By month three, she was getting desperate. She tried to hold my hand in public. I'd give her a fist bump instead. When she leaned in for a kiss at dinner, I went for the high five. Bros don't make out at restaurants, I said. The waiter smirked.

I didn't receive anything. My grandmother's face darkened as she turned to my parents. The fifteen thousand dollar graduation trip to Europe I sent for Diego three months ago. The silence was deafening. My mom started fidgeting with her new designer purse, the one that mysteriously appeared last month along with matching shoes. My dad's gold chain suddenly felt heavier around his neck. And I noticed his expensive watch for the first time. We. We thought it would be better if my mom stamp her newly done nails, tapping nervously on the table. If what? Grandma's voice cut like ice. If you stole from your own son. That's when it all clicked. The sudden shopping sprees every weekend. My sister's new iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Family vacation to Cancun that I wasn't invited to. A kitchen renovation. Dad's new motorcycle sitting in our driveway. They'd stolen my graduation gift and spent it on themselves like it was Christmas morning. My sister Estania, who never worked a day in her life, was wearing earrings that cost more than my monthly gas station salary. Diamond studs that sparkled under the restaurant lights. She. I didn't even look up from her plate, too busy admiring her fresh manicure. You gave them everything their entire lives, I said quietly, my voice shaking with years of suppressed anger. And they took The one thing meant for me. The one thing I actually earned. Grandma stood up, her chair scraping against the floor loud enough to make nearby diners turn. 20 years I've watched you favor Estania over Diego like he's invisible. I sent that money specifically for him. With a letter explaining every detail of the trip I planned. My mom's face went white as paper. We never got a letter, I swear. Because you threw it away after cashing the check that had his name on it. The restaurant felt silent, despite other diners around us. Even the waiters seemed to sense the drama unfolding at our table. I couldn't hold back anymore. This explains everything. Why you suddenly had money for mom's Botox appointment and weekly spa days. Why dad bought that Harley Davidson he's been wanting for years. Why Estania got her nose job and started posting Instagram photos from five star hotels every single week. My grandmother's eyes widened with each revelation. Nose job? Instagram photos? Show me. I pulled out my phone and showed her Estania's recent posts. Bullside shots at luxury resorts in Miami. Designer shopping halls from Rodeo Drive. First class plane seats with champagne glasses. Expensive restaurant meals that cost more than I made in a week. All time stamped from the past three months. Right after my graduation, I've been working 70 hour weeks at the gas station. Just

I also had to brush maggots off my backpack because the smell of rotting meat from somewhere deep in the house attracted flies that laid eggs on everything.

Sometimes I'd hear crunching when I accidentally stepped on the bones of one of our cats that died and got buried under trash before anyone noticed. My breakfast came from sealed packages only because I once almost ate cereal that was full of ants. A lot of the time, I had to pee in bottles because the path to the toilet got blocked by the collapsing mountain of adult diapers my mother bought in bulk. Nobody in our house needed them, but she insisted they'd be worth money during the next pan. When Parker transferred to our school and picked me to be his history partner, I tried to convince him to switch. I knew eventually he'd want to meet outside school, but he had already turned in the paper with our names and said it would be too much hassle to change it now. He kept pushing. To work at my house I finally made up this whole story about my grandmother being sick. I said that she was super contagious and had something doctors couldn't figure out. He suggested his place instead and even offered to pick me up so I wouldn't have to take a bus. I said the bus didn't run to his neighborhood, even though really I just didn't wanna trap him in a car with my smell. I've been washing my clothes in the bathroom sink at school with the pink hand soap and drying them under the hand dryer, but the smell of decomposition and ammonia had gotten into the fabric permanently. Walking into his house broke my brain because my eyes didn't know what to do with all of the empty floor space it took.

For 14 years, Debbie Salzman worked as a beloved lunch lady here at Denver Place Elementary School in Wilmington. She says she would upgrade the lunch of a child who didn't have enough money or give them extra food if they said they were still hungry. If they didn't have enough money on their account, they would get a cheese sandwich instead. Friend that got a free lunch that would come back and say, Miss Debbie, I'm still hungry. Didn't you get your belly full for supper last night? And you don't know how many times I heard they didn't have supper that night. Salesman says she kept posted note IOU's and paid out of her own pocket for kids. But the district suspended and terminated her this February for, quote, not keeping track of a register and providing food to her grandchildren without payment, end quote. Salesman admits to giving her grandchildren extra food, too, but says it wasn't just them. I broke the rule. I'm the one that broke the rule.

Now you really look like your loser father. While my nieces were laughing. The next day her account was frozen and the bank for closed on her house. For three years, I've been financially supporting my younger sister Jessica to her divorce. I paid her mortgage, utilities, groceries, everything so she and her daughters wouldn't struggle. Jessica worked at a hair salon, but barely made enough. Over time, I noticed her attitude. She never said thank you, only criticized our life. If we bought a car, she'd say we were showing off. If we took Isabella on vacation, she'd complain that some of us aren't so lucky. Isabella, my daughter, has always been sweet with long, shiny brown hair. Sometimes she'd come home saying Aunt Jessica scolded me or Aunt Jessica said my dress was ugly. Those comments bothered me. Everything changed one Saturday. Isabella was invited to a friend's birthday party and wanted to look like a princess. I decided to take her to Jessica for a special haircut. I called and said, make Isabella look like a princess. I'll leave extra money. Jessica responded dryly, alright, leave her with me, but don't come too late. I dropped Isabella off at Jessica's house. Isabella was happy in her pink dress and sparkling shoes. I kissed her forehead and said I'd be back in a few hours. When I returned at five PM, I heard heartbreaking crying as I approached. I heard Jessica shouting, now you look like your father's failure. Bald and horrible, just like him! Then came laughter, Jessica's laugh and her daughter's giggles. I slammed the door open. Isabella was sitting in a chair with her head lowered. At her feet was a pile of hair, scattered like trash. When she lifted her face, my world collapsed. She was completely bald. Called Jessica had shaved her head, leaving not a single strand. My little princess had red eyes from crying, her face filled with shame. Jessica stood beside her with a razor, laughing. Her daughters were pointing at Isabella, mocking her look. She looks like an egg, Sophia said, laughing. How ugly! Added Lucia. I hugged Isabella tightly. She clung to me, shaking and threw her sobs. Said daddy, why did she do this to me? I just wanted to look pretty. What did you do to my daughter? I roared at Jessica. She stopped laughing, but didn't seem sorry. Calm down, Antonio, it was just a joke. I told her I was giving her a modern cut. She looks unique, she said with a mocking smile. A joke? You shaved my daughter's head! You humiliated her! She shrugged. Don't be dramatic, it's just hair. Plus that girl is always showing off with her long hair. Like my daughters aren't as beautiful. She's a 7 year old girl who wanted to feel pretty. You did this out of envy! Jessica exploded. Don't come at me! With envy crap. You're always showing off your perfect life while I'm struggling alone.

So on day 21, I made it permanent. 20 days of silence. That's what my wife decided I deserved after I suggested she help with household responsibilities instead of treating me like her personal butler. But here's the thing about playing the silent treatment card. Sometimes the other person decides they prefer the quiet. I finished a 12 hour shift and walked into what looked like a tornado hit our kitchen. Did. She's piled high. Take out containers scattered everywhere. And her on the couch scrolling through her phone. I made the apparently unforgivable mistake of saying, hey, think you could give me a hand cleaning up before dinner? The look she gave me could frozen hell over. Excuse me? I work, too. I'm not your maid. I never said you were. I thought we could tackle this together since we both live here. That's when she stood up, grabbed her purse, and delivered the line that would define the next three weeks. Figure it out yourself. And don't expect me to talk to you until you learn some respect. Front door slammed so hard it rattled the windows. When she came back two hours later, I thought we'd have a normal conversation. I was wrong. She walked past me like I was invisible and went straight to the bedroom. Day two rolled around and still nothing. I tried the reasonable approach. If I came across wrong yesterday, we should talk. She poured her coffee, walked past me, and left for work without acknowledging I existed. By day 5, I realized what this was. This wasn't about dishes or respect. This was control. She decided freezing me out would make me grovel and apologize for something I shouldn't apologize for. Day 7 was when something clicked. I was eating a sandwich, watching her perform her silent tantrum routine, and I started laughing. Here was a grown woman who thought giving me the cold shoulder was going to break me down. Instead, it was showing me exactly who I'd married. By day 10, the house had gotten remarkably peaceful. No arguing about whose turn it was to take out trash. No passive aggressive comments about the dishwasher. No dramatic sighs when I wanted to watch sports. I was starting to see the upside. Day 15 brought reinforcements. Her sister called asking if everything was okay because my wife seemed stressed. Told her everything was fine. I was giving my wife the space she'd requested. When her sister tried to dig deeper, I said, she knows how to end this anytime she wants an adult conversation. But here's what she didn't realize during her tantrum. I was using this time to think about what my life had become and what I wanted it to be. Day 20 arrived with her pacing around like a caged animal, looking at me with this.

You can figure it out. She shrugged. I stood there watching her walk away with her perfect little blended family, dragging their matching designer suitcases toward the gate. She didn't even look back. Not once. I had $23 in my pocket, a dead phone charge charger, and absolutely nowhere to go in this massive airport. That's when I remembered the business card tucked in my wallet. The one with the fancy logo I've been carrying around for three years. My Aunt Sarah's restaurant card. The sister my mom had been bad mouthing my entire life, calling her a jealous failure. Sarah's a pathetic loser, mom always said. She's jealous of our success and stability. Buddy, don't believe anything she tells you about our family. But standing there alone in JFK Terminal 4, watching families rush past me with their vacation excitement, I figured I had nothing left to lose. I found a payphone. Yes still exist in airports. And dialed the number with shaking fingers. It rang twice before a warm, professional voice answered. Bella Vista restaurant. This is Sarah speaking. Aunt Sarah, it's Maya. I'm. I'm in really big trouble right now. The silence lasted forever. Then, in a completely different tone. Baby girl? Maya, where are you? Are you safe? What happened? I started crying. Right there in the middle of the Busy terminal. Mom left me at the airport. She took her new husband and his kids on vacation to Hawaii and just abandoned me here. What terminal are you at? I'm coming to get you right now. You don't understand. I'm at JFK in New York. You're all the way in Chicago. I can't ask you to. Maya, Honey, listen to me carefully. I have three successful restaurants now. I'm not the broke failure your mother told you I was. Exactly where you are. I'm getting on the next available flight. Four hours later, I watched a confident woman in designer jeans and a cashmere coat rush through the arrivals gate, scanning the crowd frantically. She looked exactly like mom, but her eyes were kind instead of cold. When she spotted me, she started running. I've been waiting 10 years for the phone call, she whispered, hugging me so tight I could barely breathe. I've tried reaching you so many times, but your mother blocked every single attempt. To ride to her luxury hotel suite was completely surreal. Sarah explained everything while ordering room service. How she built a successful restaurant empire from nothing. How she been sending birthday cards and Christmas gifts that mom apparently threw away unopened. How she'd even hired a family lawyer once to try for visitation rights. Your mother told everyone in our family

I didn't argue. I just closed our joint accounts and changed the locks instead. Last Tuesday, I received divorce papers from my wife, Natalia, after four years of marriage. But she didn't deliver them herself. Her new boyfriend, Gabriel, showed up at my doorstep with the envelope. Natalia wants you out by Friday, he told me with arrogant, confident. Find somewhere else to stay. I looked at this guy, who'd clearly been sleeping with my wife, and simply replied, okay. He probably expected me to break down or punch him. Instead, I closed the door and started making calls. First to my lawyer, then to the bank. What? Gabriel and Natalia didn't know the house was solely in my name. I bought it before we married with inheritance money and never added her to the title. Gabriel had been living there for a month while I was away for work. Natalia claimed he was an acquaintance going through tough time. Complete lie. When he demanded I find somewhere else to stay. He was trying to kick me out of my own house. By Wednesday morning, I changed all the locks. That afternoon, I canceled Gabriel's access to everything. Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Prime. He'd even added himself to my 90 Dollar Family Gym membership. Canceled that too. Thursday night, Gabriel appeared, banging on the door. What the hell is going on? Why did you change the locks? Cause this is my house. I Replied from inside, Natalia can get her things, but you have to leave. She's my partner. Now we're together. Perfect. Go be together somewhere else. His tantrum was epic, screaming that I was vengeful that he had rights. Meanwhile, I recorded everything. I texted Natalia, you have 48 hours to collect your belonging. Gabriel is not welcome here. Her response you can't do this. Gabriel lives here now. Check the property title. He's nowhere on it. The next morning, Gabriel's lawyer showed up, claiming Gabriel had tendency rights because as he'd lived there over 30 days. I showed him the recording of Gabriel screaming that he was there as my wife's partner, not a tenant. There's no lease, no rent payments, no contributions, I explained, showing the property title with me as sole owner. The lawyer went pale and left quickly.

Twitch chatter. Sarah came home from her 12 hour hospital shift to find me in the same spot at my computer. Twitch stream on one monitor, spreadsheets minimized on the other. She dropped her bag with that familiar exhausted sound. Mike, eight months. You've been unemployed for eight months watching gamers play Fortnite? My mom keeps asking if you're depressed. I quickly switched tabs as she approached. Just keeping myself busy. Busy? You're watching someone build a virtual house. She saw my chat messages and actively participating. This isn't a hobby anymore. It's an addiction. What she didn't see were the other tabs supplier emails from China, Shipping trackers, customer service responses. The Twitch streams were just background noise while I managed orders, adjusted Facebook ad campaigns, and negotiated with suppliers about delayed shipments. My sister's husband just bought a rental property, Sarah continued. Meanwhile, I'm telling people you're between opportunities. Truth was, my dropshipping business was finally profitable after 6 months of testing products. Gaming accessories of all things. Mouse pads with LED edges, custom keyboard caps, able management systems. Stuff I found by watching what streamers complained about. Can you at least come to dinner tomorrow? Pretend you're trying. Her family dinner was torture. Her brother described his new BMW. Her father offered me a pity job at his hardware store. Again, Sarah deflected questions about our future, saying we were figuring things out. Maybe he could drive For Uber, her mother suggested. Loud enough for me to hear. Everything unraveled because the doorbell camera notification. Sarah was showing her sister our ring footage to prove our neighbor's dog kept getting in our yard. She scrolled too far back and saw something odd. Delivery drivers. Dozens of them. Every single day. Mike, why are so many packages coming to our house? Her sister leaned in. Are you shopping addicts? Is that why you're broke? Their returns, I said quickly. But Sarah kept scrolling. The packages were being picked up, not dropped off. Different drivers collecting them. What the hell is this? I couldn't hide it anymore. Opened my laptop and showed her the Shopify dashboard. 300 orders this month. Inventory spreadsheet showing zero stock because everything shipped directly from suppliers to customers. You're selling things? Gaming accessories. Mouse pads, mostly. She stared at the revenue numbers. Last month was my best yet. Enough to cover our mortgage twice. But you don't have any products here. They ship from the supplier. I handle marketing and customer service. I showed her the Facebook ads running in the background, the email campaigns, the abandoned cart sequences. This. This is real money. I opened the business checking account. Six months of deposits from Shopify. Not fortune, but solid middle class income from selling LED mouse pads to gamers. Why didn't you tell me? Remember when I tried explaining dropshipping? You said it was a pyramid scheme for people who watch too many YouTube gurus because you explained it while watching someone play Minecraft at 2:00am, her sister was reading over her shoulder. Wait, he's been running a business this whole time? Sarah scrolled through customer emails, reviews, the business registration, tax documents, everything legit, just invisible. I've been telling everyone you're unemployed. I cried to my therapist about supporting you. I know my dad offered you minimum wage out of pity. I make more than his offer in three days selling mouse pads. Her phone started buzzing, family group chat exploding as her sister shared the news. Her dad asking how online selling actually worked. Her mom confused about what dropshipping meant. Why all the secrecy, though? It wasn't supposed to be secret. But every time I tried explaining, you'd see me on the computer and assume I was wasting time. Eventually, I stopped trying.

Penny cornered me at lunch Monday, Monica and Christina flanking her like bodyguards. Jenna, this is an intervention, she announced. Monica snorted. You text me literally every five minutes. You waited outside my math class yesterday, even though yours is across campus. You got weird when I went to Monica's sleepover without you. She crossed her arms. It's honestly embarrassing. Monica's best friend has her own life, her own friends. They're independent. You're, like, obsessed with me or something. Christina laughed. No offense, but it's giving desperate. Penny shrugged. You need to get your own life and stop making me her entire personality. I felt my face burn, but looking at Penny's expression, I realized she was serious. Had I really been that bad? After my parents divorced, penny was my rock. Maybe I'd held on too tight. Maybe I depended on her too much emotionally. I'm sorry, I said quietly. I didn't realize I was making you uncomfortable. Starting Tuesday, I gave her exactly what she asked for. No morning texts. Said they were too much. I saw her in the hallway and just smiled instead of running over. She wanted space. At lunch, I accepted the Art Girls invitation to sit with them. They've been asking for weeks, and I'd always said no to stay with penny. They were genuinely excited to have me. Finally, Lorelai said, We've been wanting to be friends forever. But you were always with penny. They were so welcoming, teaching me their inside jokes, including me in their group chat. Thursday morning hurt the most. We bought tickets together weeks ago for the school's talent show. Front row seats to support our friends band. I sat there alone, saving her seat with my backpack until the lights dimmed. She never came. During intermission, I saw her Instagram story. She was at Starbucks with Monica and Christina, laughing over Frappuccinos. The caption read, so much better than boring school events. My eyes burned with tears. I wouldn't let fall. She'd known and didn't show up. And worse, she seemed happier without me. I deleted the text I'd started typing, asking where she was. She wanted space, and clearly she was thriving with it. After the show, I joined the drama club, something penny had always made fun of. When Romeo from drama asked if I wanted to practice lines after school, I said yes. Immediately. I posted a selfie with him captioned new drama partner with heart emojis. Penny viewed it in 10 seconds, but didn't like it. Lorelai invited me to a party Friday. Penny will be there, too, she mentioned. At the party, I stayed with my new friends, but kept checking on penny discreetly. She was with Monica and Christina by the pool. When Monica loudly said, at least you finally got rid of your stalker. I pretend ended not To hear penny laughed along with them, that stung. But if that's how she felt, I'd respect it. Everything crashed down Tuesday. I was heading to art club when I heard someone crying in the bathroom. Harsh, painful sobs. My heart knew it was penny before my brain did. Soph, are you okay? I asked softly through the door. Leave me alone, Jenna. I don't want to guilt you into caring about my problems. What? Penny, please let me in. The door unlocked. I look destroyed. Mascara streaking, eyes swollen. My parents are getting divorced, she whispered. Dad's been cheating for months. I found out Sunday night. My heart broke. I pulled her into my arms, feeling her whole body shake. She told me through gasps how she'd wanted to call me Sunday night when her dad moved out, but Monica had convinced her not to be a hypocrite. How she'd seen my Instagram.

Last summer, my parents decided we needed a technology free family bonding road trip to Yellowstone. They announced this planet dinner looking way too proud of themselves. No phones, no tablets, no Nintendo Switch, dad declared. We're going to reconnect as a family and appreciate nature. My 16 year old sister Denki and I just stared at them in horror. A week long road trip with no electronics? They might as well have suggested we travel by covered wagon. But what if there's an emergency? Denki asked, already plotting. We'll have our phones for emergencies only, mom said. But they'll be locked in the glove compartment. The night before we left, Denki and I held an emergency sibling meeting. We were not going down without a fight. Operation Digital Rebellion is a go! She whispered, pulling out a duffel bag full of contraband electronics. We spent hours hiding devices throughout our luggage. Denki sown a secret pocket into her pillow for her phone. I hollered out a thick book and stuffed my Nintendo Switch inside. We even hit a portable charger inside a bag of trail mix. Day one started with Dad's enthusiastic announcement. Isn't this great, kids? Look at all this beautiful scenery. Let's play the license plate game. Wow, dad, A Nebraska plate! Riveting. Denki deadpanned while secretly texting her boyfriend through her pillow. By hour three, mom was getting suspicious because we were being unusually cooperative. About her car games. Little did she know, I was playing Pokemon under a blanket while pretending to nap. You kids seem awfully quiet back there, she said, turning around. Just enjoying the family bonding, mom, I said, quickly shoving my switch under my fake book. Denki had gotten creative with her rebellion. She downloaded audiobooks and was listening through earbuds she threaded through her hoodie strings. Every time mom asked her a question, she pretend to be deep in thought about nature. By day two, we'd established an elaborate system. Denki would be the lookout while I game, then we'd switch. We communicated through coughs and sneezes. That meant parents incoming or coast is clear. The funniest part was when dad stopped at this scenic overlook and insisted we all take a family photo. While he was setting up his camera, Denki was frantically trying to finish a level on her hidden phone game. Denki, Smile! Dad called out, just a second. I'm appreciating the natural beauty, she said, thumbs flying across her screen. Our rebellion reached peak chaos on day three when we discovered the hotel had terrible Wi-Fi. Denki had a complete meltdown because she couldn't upload her secret vacation selfies to Instagram. The bathroom has better no! She whispered to me during dinner. So there we were, taking turns hiding in the hotel bathroom, desperately trying to get one bar of service while our parents thought we had digestive issues from the road trip snacks. You Kids have been spending a lot of time in the bathroom, mom observed suspiciously. Must be all that healthy trail mix you packed, I said innocently, while Denki was literally sitting on the bathroom floor trying to connect to Wi-Fi. Day 4 brought disaster. Dad decided to surprise us with a spontaneous hike and grabbed our backpacks to carry water bottles. That's when he discovered Denki's secret phone charging station she'd set up using the car's USB port. What is this?

Now my, he wants my house. When I was 16, my gaming obsessed brother Tyler convinced my parents I was taking up too much space in our cramped three bedroom apartment. He'd been complaining for months that he needed my room for his elaborate gaming setup. My parents sat me down one evening and basically said I had two weeks to find alternative living arrangements. The reasoning, I was almost 17, practically an adult and Tyler needed space to pursue his passion in gaming and they genuinely believed he was going to become the next big twitch star. I was devastated but had nowhere to go. My girlfriend Emma's parents noticed I'd been spending more time at their house and eventually asked what was going on. When I explained the situation, her mom immediately said I could stay stay with them as long as I needed, no questions asked. Emma and I got serious fast. Living under the same roof will do that to a relationship. When we turned 19, I proposed with a ring. I'd saved six months for working overtime every weekend. Parents were thrilled. They basically raised me for two years anyway and considered me their son. At 23, we finally had enough saved for a down payment on a small two bedroom house, nothing fancy. We spent every weekend renovating, learning YouTube tutorials, making mistakes and fixing them. Meanwhile, Tyler was still living with my parents in his gaming paradise. He Dropped out of community college after one semester, claiming his streaming career was about to take off. College was just holding him back. Three years later, he was still grinding away at maybe five viewers on a good day, sleeping until two PM, gaming until 4:00am, ordering Doordash with my parents money. My parents occasionally texted generic holiday messages or shared Facebook posts about family, but otherwise, we had zero relationship. Last month, my mom showed up at my house completely unannounced. I hadn't seen her.

My parents were so worried about me dating a skater boy, they couldn't imagine he'd be the reason I'm still alive today. A few nights ago, my parents found out about my skater boyfriend, reggis, when his message popped up on my screen at dinner. I love you, too. Who the heck are you talking to? My mom shouted, glaring at the screen of my phone. You're 14. No dating until you're 30. We were very clear. Dad pulled up Reggis's Instagram on his own phone. Escape border? Really? This is who you're risking your future for? I tried to reason with them, but they refused to listen and forced me to block him everywhere, right there, over dinner. You'll thank us when you're in college, mom said while I sobbed. My friends tried passing messages between us at school, but my parents found out and threatened to call their parents. Eventually, everyone gave up, except for Greggus. Greggus showed up mysteriously in my valorant lobby. Hey, Mel. It's been a while, he said, his voice breaking. I miss you, Mel. I know we're not supposed to talk, but let's at least play like we used to. We started meeting in the lobbies every day after that, just playing and chatting about normal things. School friends, my strict parents. He never once tried to convince me to sneak around or meet up in person. He never complained. About my parents or tried to turn me against them. When I vent about how unfair they were being, he'd actually defend them. Sometimes they're just scared, Once my older sister got mixed up with some bad people in high school. Parents get paranoid. He still cared about me in all the ways that mattered. When I failed my chemistry test because I couldn't focus, he spent three hours teaching me balancing equations over discord. When my grandmother got sick, he stayed up until 3:00am just listening to me cry. You can always reach me here, he promised. I don't care what time it is. Mom almost got us once when she walked by while discord was open. I clicked to my game lobby just in time. Homework break? She asked. I nodded and switched back to my essay, my heart pounding so hard I thought she'd hear it after she left Greg's message. Maybe we should stop. I don't want to get you in trouble, but I couldn't lose him again. He was the only person who I could rely on. And thank god I didn't lose him, because a couple of days later, my friend Sarah and I got caught up in some shady business. It was supposed to be a normal Saturday night sleepover. Her parents went out for their anniversary, leaving us to watch movies and eat junk food. I was on the phone messaging Gregus on discord when Sarah's older brother Joshua came. Home from college, completely wasted with two other friends, Sarah immediately tensed up. baby sis and baby girl. He winked disgustingly. He and his friends sat beside us on the sofa, placing his arm over my shoulder, constantly whispering things like, I know you're not as innocent as you act, and your parents don't have to know. I pushed his face away and stood up, glaring. Can you stop? Sarah was almost crying, begging me not to make him mad. He gets mean when he's drunk. She was, just ignore him and he'll pass out soon. But when Joshua grabbed my waist and tried to pull me onto his lap, I grabbed Sarah's arm and ran to the bathroom. Quickly locking the door, he started pounding on it, laughing with his friends about how I was playing hard to get and needed to loosen up. Sarah hopped into the tub, hugging her knees to her chest. I patted my pockets, realizing I had left my phone in the living room. Soon the knocks on the door became angrier. Hitting the door harder, jiggling the handle aggressively, Sarah meekly handed me her phone.

Brian thought college was a four year party with a diploma handed out at the end. I was just a nerdy roommate who'd somehow help him pass his classes. We weren't paired by choice. Housing lottery put us together freshman year. The football player and the scholarship kid. From day one, he made it clear what he thought of me. Seriously? You're studying on a Friday night? He'd laugh. This is college, man. You're supposed to be making memories. His memories involved coming back at 3:00am, stumbling into my desk, and. And occasionally vomiting near my backpack. Things shifted in October when he realized he was failing economics. The coach had warned him, maintain a 2.5 GPA or get benched. Hey, you're good at this stuff, right? He dropped his textbook on my keyboard. I need help. I agreed to tutor him, explain supply and demand curves created practice problems. He nodded along, then asked, so can you just write my paper for me? I've got a game this weekend. I refused, offered to review his draft instead. He laughed like I. I told a joke. Come on, nobody will know. I'll pay you. I can't do that, I said. It's academic dishonesty. We could both get expelled. His smile faded. Whatever, man. Thought you were cool. After that, our fragile roommate peace collapsed. He'd invite friends over when I had exams. Accidentally Spill drinks on my notes, hide my alarm clock. Before important classes, I started spending more time at the library, coming back only to sleep. I was working two part time jobs alongside a full course load. Midterms came. Brian failed economic specta. Got benched for two games. One morning, I woke up to find him staring at me, eyes bloodshot. You could have helped me, he said. Now coach says I might lose my scholarship. I tried to help. I replied, you wanted me to do it for you. Then came the real breaking point. I saved for two years to buy my first car. A used Honda with 120,000 miles. Nothing fancy, but it meant I could live off campus next year. The morning after Brian received his final warning from the athletics department, I found my car with all four tires slashed. Loser scratched into the door. Windshield crack. Campus security said they couldn't.

Mom's eating breakfast, scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading Life 3, 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work part time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest, she says. If we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear, which sounds like something a dictator would say. But whatever. She makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realize immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3, 60 doesn't just show where you are, it shows your speed when driving, your phone battery, and sends notifications for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect. Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says, no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she's shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is, men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realize she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom checked your location while I'm at school, dad text she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realize she's literally sitting there refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day 3, mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 in a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses a client worth $2,000. Week 2, she sees I stopped at McDonald's for three minutes and lectures me about wasting money, which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for four hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and ask her four hours at one store and mom glares at me like I should have warned her he was checking but how can I when she's watching my every move? She used to Text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until eleven PM Dad mentions, that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough, but I've been to that clinic. They close at 6 that night. Dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits, and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives marked final Notice, and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that. And mom says, processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location pins on the map. Week 5 and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the Medical Plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11:00am and it's now six PM I tell my manager I'm sick and drive over. Dad's already there in the parking lot looking at life. 3, 60, zoom.

My older sister is super jumpy. Like she gets scared if the toast pops up too loud. So when I found out she'd been watching creepy sleepwalking videos all week, I saw my golden opportunity. One night I stayed up late and waited until I knew she was asleep. Then I slowly opened her bedroom door, walked in barefoot with my eyes half closed and started mumbling random garbage like the bees are listening. They can smell light. She's screamed full panic. I pretended to snap out of it like I didn't know what was going on. And the next morning I told her I had no memory of it. That's what really got her. She was convinced I was actually sleepwalking. So I did it again the next night. This time I stood at the end of her bed holding a spoon and just went spread, I am the serial. I was holding myself from bursting out laughing. After that, she started locking her door. So I got creative. I'd rattle the doorknob or just whisper her name through the air vent until she freaked out. I kept telling her I didn't remember any of it. My acting was elite. She even started filming me to prove it was real. But I would just delete the videos when she wasn't looking. It became this little war. Honestly, it was the most fun I'd had in weeks. I never Meant to actually scare her, just mess with her a little. But then one night she ran into my room looking pale and said, I need to show you something right now. I followed her down the hall thinking it was just another one of her overreactions. she opened her phone and pulled up a video from the night before. The footage showed her room in the dark and a figure slowly pushing the door open. Me or someone that looked like me. I watched the figure step into her room, stand completely still for a full minute, then start whispering. But it wasn't gibberish this time. It was my name. Over and over, whispered slowly, almost like then it tilted its head and said, I know you're awake. That's when the video cut out. I tried to laugh it off and said, okay, I admit it, that one was actually kind of good. But she didn't laugh. She looked at me and said, that wasn't from last night. That was from the night you slept over at Sam's house. My stomach dropped. I'd spent that night two neighborhoods over crashing on my friend's couch. I pulled out my own phone to double check the text. There it was, a message from me at 11:08 saying, crashing here tonight. Tell mom that video was recorded at 203:00am. I stared at the screen and tried to find some logical explanation. Maybe someone was messing with us. Maybe she faked The whole thing. But then she said, I didn't want to tell you, but a few nights ago I saw you standing in the hallway. I called your name and you didn't answer. You just walked into the bathroom and never came out. When I checked a minute later, the light was off and the room was empty. That was the part I couldn't explain because I remembered.

My parents discovered I wasn't their biological child when I was 16, not through some dramatic DNA test, through my little sister's science project. She was doing genetics homework, mapping out eye colours and couldn't make our family tree work. Brown eyes plus brown eyes can't make blue eyes, she, he said, pointing at me. Mom went white. Dad started stuttering about recessive genes. That night I heard them screaming through the walls. Mom admitted she had an affair 17 years ago. Dad wasn't my father. The man who raised me, taught me to ride a bike, helped with homework for 16 years, suddenly looked at me like I was a stranger. The change was immediate and brutal. Dad stopped coming to my baseball games. When I try talking to him, he'd respond with one word answers or just leave the room. Mom kept insisting nothing had changed, but he'd flinch whenever dad was cold to me. Then came the comparisons. Every family dinner became a catalog of how my sister and I were different. Look how naturally athletic Sophie is, dad would say, watching her throw a ball. She gets that from me. The implication hung in the air like poison. They started treating me like a house guest. My curfew got earlier while my sister stayed the same. My allowance got cut because money is tight. But Sophie got new clothes whenever she asked. When I brought it up, mom said, I Was being dramatic. The worst part was watching them rewrite history. Photos of me got moved to the back of albums. My baby pictures disappeared from the mantle. Dad started telling stories about Sophie's milestones while pretending mine never happened. It was like they were erasing 16 years. My breaking point came during Christmas. Extended family was over and Uncle Mike asked about my college plans. Dad said, well, he's not really academic like Sophie. Different genetics, you know, he said genetics like it was a dirty word. That's when it clicked. Didn't just learn I wasn't blood related. They decided I wasn't family. So I made a choice that destroyed them. I found my biological father. His name was John Sins. He lived three states away, had no idea I existed. When I called him, he cried, actually cried. Said he'd wondered about my mom for years, hoped she was happy. Two weeks later, John drove 400 miles to meet me. He brought photo albums of his family, told me about my half brother who played baseball like me, showed me pictures of my real grandmother who had died the year before. But here's what broke my parents. John didn't just accept me, he celebrated me. Within a month, he'd driven back twice more. He came to my games, met my friends, me car shopping for my 17th birthday. My parents watched this man give me everything they taken away. Dad became obsessed, calling John a stranger, trying to Steal his son. Mom begged me to stop seeing him, said it was destroying our family. I told them they'd already destroyed it. The night they decided biology mattered more than 16 years of love. The final blow came at graduation. Both my family showed up. John sat in the front road.

Everyone knew Gabby was more than just our big sister. She became our mom the day ours died. When she was 18, Gabby taught my brother how to shave, stayed up all night when my youngest sister had nightmares, and somehow made four teenagers feel safe in a world that had just collapsed. But last Thanksgiving changed everything forever. Gabby had been trying to have a baby for three years. At 38, her doctor said IVF was her only shot, but insurance wouldn't cover it at $15,000 per round. She called a family meeting after Sunday dinner, her hands shaking as she explained, I've never asked you guys for anything, but I need help. I know it's a lot of money. We all said we'd figure it out together. Everyone hugged her that night. Liam said, of course we'll help. You deserve this. Becca literally cried, saying, I've always wanted to be an aunt. Kelsey promised to set up a payment plan for all of us. Gabby was glowing. This was her dream. She booked the appointment for next month, texting us, they need the deposit Tuesday at three PM. We can all meet there. Everyone responded with thumbs up and heart emojis. She started a spreadsheet showing how if each of us contributed $3,000, she could start treatment next month. She sent us IVF success stories and potential baby names. Even asked Becca to be be her Birth partner. But then Liam bought a new BMW. That week, Becca booked a month long Europe trip with her husband. Kelsey renovated her entire kitchen. Gabby saw everything, but stayed quiet. Tuesday, I got to the clinic at 2:45 with $2,000 all I could scrape together. Gabby was already there, dressed up, smiling while clutching her purse. They're coming, right? She kept asking. 3 p m. Past 3:34 p m. She kept calling. No answer. The clinic closed. I held her hand as she had to cancel the appointment. Liam texted the group chat first. Can't swing it right now. Tight month. Becca same. Sorry. Kelsey just sent a sad face emoji. Gabby replied, I understand. And nothing else. Later that night, I found her on the floor, sobbing in the nursery. She'd already started decorating, holding the baby clothes she bought on sale. She didn't know I could see her from the hallway as she saw into a tiny yellow onesie that said, worth the wait. I held her as she shook. I really thought they'd come, she whispered. Two months later, at Mom's death anniversary dinner, Gabby brought it up one last time. She'd found a clinic that offered payment plans and only needed $2,000 from each of us to start. I'm running out of time, she said quietly. Please, I've never asked for anything else. I laughed. Gabby, maybe motherhood just isn't meant for you. I mean, you've never even been married. Liam nodded. Yeah, and You already raised us. Isn't that enough for you? Kelsey added. It's kind of selfish to bring a kid into the world alone at your age. Gabby's face went completely blank. She slowly looked at each of us. Selfish, Gabby whispered. Then louder. Selfish! She stood up and walked to her bedroom, returning with a large photo album I'd never seen before. She started pulling out birthday cards, dozens of them, spreading them across the table. Liam, your 18th birthday. Read what you wrote. Liam's face reddened as Gabby read it aloud. Gabby, you saved my life. I owe you everything. Every penny I ever make, I owe to you. She grabbed another. Becca, your college graduate

When Uncle Ray died last month, I thought I'd maybe get his old fishing gear or some random furniture. I was his only niece who actually visited him, bringing him groceries and cleaning his tiny apartment every week. He always seemed grateful, but never talked much about family drama or money. The lawyer called me down to his office on a rainy Tuesday. I sat in this fancy leather chair while he read through the will. Most of it was boring legal stuff about bank accounts and his beat up Honda. Then he reached into a locked drawer and pulled out a metal box. Your uncle left specific instructions for this, he said, sliding it across the desk. Inside was a small black pistol wrapped in cloth, along with registration papers showing it was legally his. Underneath was a handwritten note and Uncle Ray's messy writing. Don't trust him. Check the basement, R. I had no idea what that meant. Don't trust who? Uncle Ray lived alone and barely talked to anyone except me and his neighbor, Missus Chen, who brought him soup sometimes. The lawyer said he couldn't explain anything more, just that I was supposed to get the gun and note exactly as written. That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the basement thing. Uncle Ray's apartment was on the first floor of this old duplex, but there was A basement that the landlord used for storage. I'd never been down there, but Uncle Ray had mentioned it once when his water heater broke. I decided to drive over the next day. The building looked different in daylight, more run down than I remembered. I found the landlord, this guy named Pete, who I'd met once when Uncle Ray was having plumbing issues. He seemed nervous when I asked about going to the basement. Your uncle was always complaining about noises down there, Pete said. Jangling his keys. Probably just rats or something. But when he opened the basement door, I could tell something was wrong. There were fresh footprints in the dust boxes. That looks like they've been moved recently. In the back corner, behind the water heater, I found a loose floorboard. When I pried it up, there was a plastic bag with photos inside. They showed Pete going through Uncle Ray's apartment when Ray wasn't home. In one picture, Pete was clearly looking through Ray's mail. In another, he was at Ray's computer. I confronted Pete upstairs, and his whole story fell apart. Turns out he'd been stealing from elderly tenants for years. He would copy their keys, go through their stuff when they were out, and even steal their identity information. Uncle Ray had figured it out and started taking pictures from his window. Pete got angry and started moving toward me. But then I remembered the gun in my car. I didn't pull it. Out or anything, but knowing I had it made me feel safer. I told Pete I was calling the cops, and he better not follow me. The police found way more evidence in Pete's apartment. Bank statements, stolen mail, even credit cards belonging to other tenants. Uncle Ray had been building a case against him, but died before he could report it. The craziest part. Uncle Ray had been slowly moving his valuable stuff to a storage unit because he knew Pete was watching him. The gun wasn't just for Protection. It was his way of making sure I'd be safe when I discovered the truth. I still have that gun locked away safely.

I smiled. I haven't heard of that one. Her words slurred from the laughing gas. It's when we hear daddy's car and everyone freezes like statues. My hygienist, Sierra, raised an eyebrow. That sounds interesting. How do you play? When we hear the garage, Mommy says statue time and we all freeze wherever we are, Isabella explained drowsily. Even if I'm eating or playing, everything stops. That's when I noticed the faint yellow marks on her upper arm, mostly hidden by her sleeve. Sometimes I'm really good at it. Last week I held my spoon in the air for 20 whole minutes. She seemed proud. Mommy said I was the best statue ever. Twenty minutes is a long time, I said, gently adjusting her sleeve to see better. Fingerprint bruises? Old ones. Can you raise your arm for me, sweetie? I need to adjust the chair. As she raised both arms, her shirt rode up. Linear marks crossed her lower back, some scarred, some fresh. What happens if someone moves during statue time? I kept working, acting like I was just doing my job. That's losing. Daddy doesn't like when we lose. I excused myself to get a different tool, stepping to my computer to pull up our mandatory reporting protocols. When I returned, I asked casually, and if you win the statue game? If we're all good statues, daddy walks through and goes To his room. Then we can breathe normal again. Sometimes he even says good job. And we get to eat dinner. You get to eat dinner? Only if we win. Losers don't deserve dinner. But mommy sneaks me crackers later. I made a show of checking Isabella's chart while secretly measuring the bruise patterns with my pen light. 3 2 cm spread on the grip marks. Adult male hand size. Isabella, what other games does your family play? I asked. Oceaning my hygiene to discreetly check on the father. The listening game, where he asks questions and we have to answer exactly right. I pulled out my light. Open wide again. What kind of questions? Like who's the most important person in this house? The answer is always daddy. The light revealed slight scarring on her inner cheek, likely from biting during stress. What happens when someone gets the answer wrong? Sometimes no breakfast or lunch. My tummy hurts so bad, but crying makes it worse. My least favorite one is the quiet room. I set down my tools. Tell me about this quiet room. While I set up this X ray. I positioned the lead apron, noting how she winced when I touched her shoulders. It's the closet under the stairs. No light. We stay until we're sorry enough. I count to know how long I lasted. My record is 10,000 seconds. It's yours. The excitement in her voice broke my heart. That was over two and a half Hours. That's a lot of counting, Sierra returned, mouthing. Her dad's asking how much longer you'll be. Mommy went in there last week, Isabella continued. She had to fold up real small cause she's bigger. Daddy said she forgot who pays the bills. Sometimes I hear her crying in there, but I can't help or I go in, too. We Learned that rule the hard way. I took the X rays, handed her some stickers, and said, I need to develop these. Sierra will stay with you in the hallway. I called CPS from my cell. Active abuse case. Child has physical marks. Describes systematic torture disguised as games. Father is in waiting room. Returning, I pretended to review her chart. Isabella, has anyone else seen you play these games? No. Oh, silly. It's a family secret. Daddy says other people wouldn't understand our special rules. I gently examined her neck, finding more old bruises hidden by her hair. Does your teacher know about the statue game? No. We're really good at keeping secrets. Paul's getting good, too. He hasn't cried in the quiet room for three weeks. He's only six. The neighbors called the police once about the screaming. Now he just hits his head against the wall, but real soft. So no

My dad banned me from the internet completely. No computer, no tablet, no phone with data. At 17, I was the only kid writing papers on a typewriter. When I tried using a library computer for two minutes to check college applications, Dad's tracking apps alerted him instantly. Scream so loud on the phone that everyone stared. The librarian asked me to leave. He reported my friend's mom to child services after she let me use their laptop. The investigation took three months. I wasn't allowed at their house anymore. Dad smiled when I told him. Another bad influence eliminated. My aunt visited for Thanksgiving. She watched me handwriting a 20 page paper, and something changed in her face. After dinner, she pulled me into the bathroom and locked the door. Your dad just started new arthritis medication, she whispered, hands shaking. It's called meloxicam. My dispatch center has had three emergency calls this month. Severe allergic reactions to this exact medication. One man died in his kitchen. She pulled out an old tablet. For reading only, she said loudly, then grabbed my shoulders. I've downloaded everything you need. Medical guides, emergency protocols. All offline so he can't track it. She made me look directly at her. If someone's allergic to meloxicam, and it happens fast, 10 to 15 minutes after taking it, their throat swells from the inside, like a balloon inflating in their windpipe. You have five minutes from the First symptom to complete airway closure. She described what I'd see. Red welts spreading like spilled paint. Lips puffing out. The tongue swelling so big it pushes out of their mouth. The person's face turns purple while they claw at their throat. They can't scream because their vocal cords are swelling shut. Just this horrible whistling sound that gets quieter until it stops. Every morning at 5:00am, while dad did his workout, I hid under my blanket, studying that tablet. The photos made me sick. Faces so swollen they didn't look human. Purple lips, eyes bulging from pressure. I read about how people waste time during anaphylaxis. They look for car keys, thinking they can drive themselves. They call relatives instead of 9 1 1. By the time they realize they're dying, their throat is too swollen to speak. Die holding their phones, unable to give their address. I practiced dialing 9 1 1 in my head over and over. Anaphylaxis. Medication, allergy. Send epinephrine. Short sentences, clear information. I memorized it like a prayer. Tuesday morning, dad took his arthritis pill with orange juice. I watched him swallow it and check the clock. Ten minutes later, he started scratching his neck. Turn down the heat, he said. But I can see my breath in the kitchen. He kept scratching harder. Red welts spread up from his collar. His lips started puffing out. He touched them with confusion that turned to fear. When he stood, his chair crashed backward. He Pointed at his throat and tried to speak, but only horrible wheezing came out. His tongue was swelling, pushing out of his mouth. He lunged for the landline and put it to his ear. Nothing. He clicked the receiver frantically. Still dead. He hadn't paid the Bill in two months. Because landlines are scams. His cell phone was upstairs, charging. The realization hit him. We had no way to call for help. His face was turning purple. Hives erupted everywhere. He dropped to his knees with both hands around his throat. The wheezing was getting quieter. That whistling sound aunt warned me about. He pointed down desperately at his car keys, tried to stand, but his legs gave out. He crashed into the table and plates shattered. Then he was crawling toward the door. He made it five feet before collapsing face first. His lips were dark blue, the whistling almost gone. He rolled onto his back and his eyes found mine. Pure terror. My father. Who

They sent this email at like, 3 in the morning, which was real helpful when I'm already asleep and have to work the next day. I'm scrambling around trying to find someone to watch my kid because I literally could not miss work that day. Had this huge presentation that would basically make or break my job. So I'm calling everyone I know at like, 6:00am. The only person who picks up is my step brother's girlfriend, Ashley. He doesn't work, just sits around all day while my step brother pays for everything. I mean everything. Her daily Starbucks runs, weekly nail appointments, the whole designer purse collection. It's been trying to get her to do literally anything productive for years, but whatever. I'm desperate. I call her up, and she's like, oh, sure, I can totally watch him for you. I'm thinking, finally, someone's actually gonna help me out. Then she hits me with it. My family rate is $200 for six hours. I literally had to ask her to repeat that because I thought I heard wrong. $200, six hours to watch one kid who mostly just plays with his tablet anyway? Are you being serious right now? I asked. She goes on this whole speech about how this is her livelihood and she takes childcare very seriously and that she's already giving me a family discount. I'm thinking, what livelihood? You haven't worked? A day since you moved in with my stepbrother three years ago. But I'm stuck. If. If I don't show up to work that day, I'm literally getting fired. So I agree to her insane price, and she demands the money up front before I even drop my kid off. I hand over $200 cash, drive to work fuming, and end up working barely four hours after you factor in traffic. So I basically paid 50 bucks an hour for her to sit on her couch and make sure my kid didn't burn the house down. Fast forward two years. Ashley and my step brother break up, but somehow she ends up living rent free in his dad's extra house and driving my dad's old car. My step brother still pays all her bills because they have a kid together now. She finally gets a job at some retail place because he stopped funding her weekly spa days. Then last month, I get this panicked text in our family group chat. Emergency! My babysitter bailed and I have to work today or I'll get fired. Can anyone watch my daughter, please? I'm desperate. I'm reading this text, and I can't help but smile a little. I text her back super fast, I can totally help you out. I'll watch her. She's so relieved and grateful, sending me heart emojis and everything. I hit her with the kicker. My family rate is $200 for the day. The typing bubbles appear and Disappear, like, five times, then my phone starts blowing up. Are you kidding me right now? That's way too much. I thought we were family. You're being ridiculous. I just screenshot our old conversation from two years ago and send it back to her. This is the exact same rate you charged me.

I thought everyone had to check their mattress for cockroaches before lying down, until I was 15 years old and went to someone else's house for the first time. My morning routine involved shaking out my shoes because mice nested in them overnight. I also had to brush maggots off my backpack because the smell of rotting meat from somewhere deep in the house attracted flies that laid eggs on everything. The path to the bathroom required stepping on compressed newspapers that squished with mystery liquids that had been leaking from garbage bags since 2,011. Sometimes I'd hear crunching when I accidentally stepped on the bones of one of our cats that died and got buried under trash before anyone noticed. My breakfast came from sealed packages only because I once almost ate cereal that was full of ants. A lot of the time, I had to pee in bottles because the path to the toilet got blocked by the collapsing mountain of adult diapers my mother bought in bulk. Nobody in our house needed them, but she insisted they'd be worth money during the next pandemic. When Parker transferred to our school and picked me to be his history partner, I tried to convince him to switch. I knew eventually he'd want to meet outside school, but he had already turned in the paper with our names and said it would be too much hassle to change it now. He kept Pushing to work at my house until I finally made up this whole story about my grandmother being sick. Said that she was super contagious and had something doctors couldn't figure out. He suggested his place instead and even offered to pick me up so I wouldn't have to take a bus. I said the bus didn't run to his neighborhood, even though really, I just didn't want to trap him in a car with my. I've been washing my clothes in the bathroom sink at school with the pink hand soap and drying them under the hand dryer, but the smell of decomposition and ammonia had gotten into the fabric permanently. Walking into his house broke my brain because my eyes didn't know what to do with all of the empty floor space. It took me, like 10 seconds to realize those white things were actual walls that didn't have brown roach stains, water damage, black streaks from whatever gross fungus was eating our house from the inside. His kitchen had a table with nothing on it, just empty space where people could put plates and eat food like normal people. When he opened a cabinet, there were dishes stacked all neat. Instead of falling out in this avalanche of broken stuff and mouse poop, he pulled out two clean glasses without having to wash them first or check for dead bugs inside. The refrigerator opened without having to throw your whole body against it because the seal wasn't Broken from years of nasty inside were leftovers in containers with actual lids, and vegetables that were green like they're supposed to be instead of brown liquid in plastic bags. The milk was just milk, not chunks floating in yellow water. When he said, god, my mom is such a neat freak. It's honestly embarrassing how she makes me clean my room every single day while pointing at a bedroom that looked like something from a movie, I made this weird choking sound like an animal being strangled. I started crying so hard I puked on his clean carpet. He got me water in a glass that didn't even have gross film on it and helped me to his bathroom where I could wash my face in a sink that was white, not brown. The sink had regular water that didn't smell like rotten eggs. I finally stopped crying. He just said, you can come here whenever you need to without asking why. Seeing a normal house made me completely lose it. When his mom drove me home later, I tried to get her to stop at the corner, but she insisted on taking me to my actual house because it was getting dark. When we pulled up to my place, I saw Parker and his mom staring at the newspapers covering every window. From inside, they saw all of the shopping carts my mother stole from grocery stores rusted and piled in the yard, and the dead tree covered In moldy plastic bags she hung to dry so she could use them again, even though they were covered in mold and bird crap. Parker's mom tried to hide it, but I could see she was horrified. Parker grabbed my arm before I got out and whispered, my mom says you can stay at our house whenever you need to. And I knew they understood everything without me having to. I thanked them both and ran inside, being careful to not open the door enough for them to see the disaster inside. That night, while my mother was passed out, I started with one corner of my room and filled a trash bag with obvious garbage, including food wrappers from when I was in elementary school and tissues so old they turned to dust when I touched them. My mother screamed at me when she noticed things were missing, but I kept going. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more!

All communication through my lawyer. I replied, understood. Then I canceled all her credit cards and cut financial support. Three days later, her lawyer called, panicking. Tuesday afternoon, buried in work, my phone buzzed. The message for my wife, Amber was brutal. Leonardo, I want a divorce. All future communication through my lawyer, Mr. Morgan. Fifteen years of marriage ended with a single text. We had dinner the night before and talked weekend plans. Nothing suggested this. I stared at the message for five minutes while shock, hurt and anger swirled beneath. But cold clarity emerged. She set the terms. Lawyers only, I replied. Understood. Practicality took over, since legal channels meant informal arrangements were void. She had supplementary cards on my accounts with authorized user status, not joint ownership. Thirty minutes of clicking. Credit cards canceled, monthly allowance stopped, Netflix and prime, logged out with passwords changed. The car she drives is leased in my name, and her gas card was tied to the canceled credit card. Not revenge, just accepting the new reality. She dictated. Her lawyer's details arrived an hour later. I forwarded them to Miss Luna, the best divorce attorney my colleague recommended. Went home to an empty house. She packed while I worked. Friday afternoon, unknown number calls. Is this Leonardo? Sharp VOICE speaking. This is Mr. Morgan. I represent Amber. My client is experiencing difficulties. Her cards declined. Funds cut off abruptly. I kept my voice level. Mister Morgan, my wife demanded divorce Tuesday, stating all communication must go through you. I complied. Informal financial arrangements ceased. Long pause. She needs funds now. Accommodation. Accommodation? Where is she staying? You acted in bad faith, cutting her off without warning. Mister Morgan, my wife ended our marriage via text and established the lawyer's only rule. Financial support will be determined legally, not by frantic calls over declined cards. My client seeks emergency financial relief. Her prerogative. Direct all filings to my attorney. Miss Luna. Conversation concluded per my wife's directive. Good day. Heart pounding as I hung up. She wanted cold and legal. She's getting it. Exactly. Within hours. Amber's best friend Haley called, furious. What the hell, Leonardo? Amber's on my couch. You cut her off completely? Haley, Amber demanded divorce via text. Lawyers only. I respected her wishes. You know she barely works. How can she survive? She hired a lawyer before talking to me. Process she chose. This is cruel. After 15 years following her exact instructions. I would have discussed things amicably if she hadn't nuked our marriage via text. And immediately lawyer up. She'll take you for everything. Haley spat. She can try. Everything goes through legal channels now. The emergency support hearing came three weeks later. Amber looks stressed, avoiding my gaze. Mr. Morgan argued she was destitute, victimized by my actions. Miss Luna calmly presented the divorce text and bank statements showing I canceled supplementary access after receiving divorce demands. Proof I still paid mortgage, utilities, insurance. The kicker evidence of Amber attempting to drain a forgotten joint savings account with $500. Trying to work around the legal process she demanded. Judge wasn't buying the victim narrative. Asked Amber directly why no prior discussion before texting divorce demands. She mumbled about being intimidated. Judge seemed skeptical. Result? Temporary support ordered closer to our figure than their astronomical demands.

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy Robert, looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let me guess, looking for a rich boyfriend? Smart girl. Lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colors are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interesting perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me, and continued his lecture. A girl like you probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do. Flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was familiar, With the artist's work. Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the Pretty Pictures doesn't count as being familiar with Art, Sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes from decades of study, not whatever you Learned from TikTok. Robert decided to test me. Rapid firing questions. Who's Basquiat? What's Kiara Scuro? Name three Renaissance painters besides da Vinci. When I started to answer, he cut me off. Wrong. See, this is why galleries shouldn't have open events. You probably googled some terms before coming here to impress men, but Riley here is working in a tradition you couldn't possibly understand without a proper education. Not community college, sweetie. Real universities. He returned to my painting, now explaining it louder to draw a crowd. What Riley has achieved here would cost probably 100,000 in education to even attempt. The materials alone cost more than you'd make in a month at whatever retail job you have. He looked at my outfit with disgust. Target clearance rack, right? Someone who shops there couldn't possibly grasp the investment in this piece. He probably spent more on one brush than your entire outfit. When I suggested the artist might be self taught, Robert sneered at me. Is that how you Learned about art? Painting parties? Robert grabbed my wrist to me to another angle, his grip too tight. You're too stupid to even stand in the right spot. Riley intended for this to be viewed from exactly here. Your ignorance is actually disrespectful to his work. He kept his hand on my wrist while explaining. Though honestly, explaining this to you is like teaching calculus to a toddler. You lack the basic foundation to understand any of it. He noticed me trying to pull away and squeezed harder. What am I keeping you from taking selfies? This is exactly why serious collectors hate these events. Girls like you come for the free alcohol and to hunt for sugar daddies. You're polluting the space where real art appreciation happens. He waved at a security guard. She's drunk. And her

Why would you wanna do that? I pulled off my helmet, confused by her urgency. I left my family in there. Her eyes were wild with panic. Excuse me. What? I grabbed my radio immediately. I have to go back. I left my family in there. She was crying now and trying to push past me toward the burning house. I called for backup while physically blocking her path. The house was fully engulfed with flames shooting through the roof. We done a sweep of the main floor and found only her path. Passed out in the living room. But if there were more people inside, especially in areas we hadn't checked yet, we needed to move fast. My captain arrived with three other firefighters. I explained the situation while the woman kept sobbing about her family being trapped inside. She said they were in the basement where she'd been doing laundry when the fire started. He'd run upstairs to get help, but got overwhelmed by smoke. We geared up for another entry. The structure was compromised, but if there were victims inside, we had to try. The woman gave us details about the basement layout and where her family Might be. She mentioned hearing them crying when she left, which made my blood run cold. There was no time to waste. Walker and I went in first, while Hensley and Kirk waited as backup. The smoke was thicker now, and visibility was basically zero. We felt our way to the basement door, which was already warm to the touch. Not a good sign. The stairs creaked under our weight, and I wondered if they'd hold. Halfway down, we heard it. Crying sounds coming from somewhere below. My heart raced as we pushed forward. A family was trapped down here, and we were their only hope. The smoke was less dense in the basement, but the heat was intense. Something was very wrong with this fire pattern. We reached the bottom and started searching. The crying seemed to be coming from the back corner, near what looked like a storage area. Boxes and old furniture blocked our path. We started moving things aside, working as fast, fast as we could. The crying got louder as we got closer. That's when the stairs collapsed behind us. The whole structure just gave way in a shower of sparks and burning timber. Walker called it in immediately. We were trapped, but we could hear victims just ahead. No firefighter would leave civilians behind, even if it meant risking our own lives. We kept pushing through the debris. The crying was constant now and sounded like multiple voices, including what seemed like a baby. How could anyone survive down here this long without proper air? The smoke was getting thicker and my air gauge was dropping fast. Finally, we reached the source. Walker pulled aside an old dresser and we both rose. There on the floor was a family of dolls. Baby dolls, child dolls, even adult sized mannequins dressed in clothes. They were arranged like a real family having dinner at a small table. Realizing that there was no way out, Walker said, it's been an honor serving with you all. Full story on channel link below.

Senior year, I finally worked up the courage to ask my crush Ebony to prom. She said yes, and I was convinced this would be the perfect night to tell her how I felt about her. I spent weeks planning everything. Rented a tux, spot a corsage, even practiced my I've liked you since freshman year speech in the mirror. The one thing I insisted on was driving. My friends all wanted to split an Uber, but I had this romantic vision of picking Ebony up in my car, just the two of us having deep conversations on the way there. What I didn't mention was that my car was a 2003 Toyota Camry with a dent in the side and a muffler that sounded like a dying whale. Ebony looked absolutely stunning when I picked her up. She was wearing this gorgeous blue dress, and I was so nervous I could barely speak. The drive to prom was going perfectly. We were talking, laughing, and I was building up the courage to tell her how I felt at prom. Everything was magical. We dance, I danced, took pictures, and I was planning to confess my feelings during the slow songs. But then my friends Jake and Marcus found me around ten PM, completely wasted from pre gaming in the parking lot. Dude, Jake slurred, hanging all over me. We need a ride home right now. Marcus threw up on his date shoes. And we got kicked out of the after party. I tried I to explain that I was having a moment with Ebony, but Marcus was turning green and mumbling about needing to get home before his parents found out he was drunk. Ebony, being the sweet person she is, said, it's okay. We should help them. We can talk later. So there I was, loading two drunk idiots into my Toyota while wearing a 200 dollar tuxedo. Jake immediately claimed shotgun and started messing with my radio while Marcus sprawled across the back seat groaning about his stomach. This car smells weird! Announced loudly, like old French fries and sadness. Ebony squeezed into the back seat next to Marcus, who kept apologizing for ruining prom night while simultaneously asking if we had any snacks. I was driving extra carefully because I had precious cargo, but Jake kept grabbing the steering wheel, saying, dude, you're driving like my grandma. Speed up! Then Marcus suddenly sat up and yelled, pull over! I'm gonna be sick! I swerved to the side of the road so fast that my muffler backfired like a gunshot. Marcus jumped out and started throwing up in someone's front yard while Jake cheered him on like it was a sporting event. That's when the police car pulled up behind us with its lights flashing. Officer Johnson got out, and of course it was the same cop who'd given me a speeding ticket last month. He took one look at Me in my tuxedo, my Toyota with the hood smoking slightly, and two drunk teenagers in formal wear. And just shook his head. Well, well, well, what do we have here? I tried to explain that I was the designated driver, completely sober, just helping my friends, but Jake chose that moment to stumble over and loudly declare,

When I turned 18, my parents sat me down for what they called a long overdue conversation. You need to move out, mom announced. Every disaster in this house happens because you're constantly provoking Gonzales. I stared in disbelief while my 14 year old brother Gonzales sat there looking innocent. The kitchen fire last week, the destroyed laptop, the hole in the garage door. It's always when you two are together. We need peace. You have two weeks to find somewhere else to live, Gonzalez smiled sweetly. I just want our family to be safe, he said, hiding behind my parents backs as he mouthed goodbye. Fine. If they wanted me to stop protecting them from Hurricane Gonzalez, I'd wish them good luck. The day after I moved out, Gonzalez decided to upgrade the house's electrical system. Every light in the neighborhood now flickered in rhythm with our toaster when mom tried to make toast. It activated the garage door, the ceiling fans and somehow started Dad's car. The power company had to shut down our entire grid and rewire our house. Bill was $3,000. It's synchronized living, Gonzales explained proudly to the electrician. Next he discovered online chemistry tutorials without me secretly replacing his chemicals with baking soda, he created what he called rainbow smoke bombs in the kitchen. But they were actually just straight up acid that ate through the tiles and corrupted all the food. Hazmat Had to gut our kitchen entirely. Total cost, $8,000. Why didn't you tell us this would happen? Mom yelled at me through the phone. I did. You just never listened, I reminded her. Then Gonzales revealed he'd been training squirrels in the attic. They're my army, he explained, as 20 squirrels wearing tiny tin foil hats and it through the ceiling during Dad's Zoom meeting with his boss. Dad got fired on the spot. Then came the car improvement incident. Gonzalez filled Dad's gas tank with what he called super juice, a mixture of energy drinks, lighter fluid and glitter. The car made it exactly.

I'll never forget seeing the new kid, Ben, sitting alone at his desk at Tuesday morning, tears streaming down his face, while the entire their class erupted in laughter around him. He was almost completely deaf and had been an easy target every single day since he transferred to our school. A few guys stood behind him, their mouths moving in exaggerated yells that Ben couldn't hear. Making obscene gestures and mimic king sign language, while Ben just saw everyone laughing at him and pointing. Gabe would take it to the next level, as he'd go as far as to scream right behind him, knowing he wouldn't react. The math teacher had stepped out to make copies, and in those five minutes, they'd already reduced Ben to tears. His eyes darted around the room, desperately trying to understand what was so funny, what he'd done wrong this time. But he just couldn't understand. I tried to help him, but every attempt just made things worse for both of us. When I stood up and told them to stop in lunch last week, he just laughed and said I had a crush on the stupid deaf kid. Which became another joke that followed me through the halls. At least three or four incidents every single day, always when teachers weren't looking. Always calculated to make Ben feel the biggest loser in our whole school. I reported it to the principal twice. But she just said, boys will be boys, and that Ben needed to learn to stand up for himself. How could he stand up to harassment he couldn't even hear? Gabe was a literal monster, but I had no idea how far he was about to go. I made one last attempt to handle this the right way by going directly to the guidance counselor with my documented evidence. I showed him three weeks of detailed notes explaining how the bullying was escalating, how Ben had started eating lunch in the bathroom, how his grades were dropping because he was too anxious to focus in class. I told her all about how Gabe had been harassing him daily, making his life a living hell. She looked at my notebook side and said that I should focus on my own education. I thought she was joking at first, but then I realized the guidance counselor was friends with Gabe's mom, and I knew she didn't believe any of it. Ben needs to learn to communicate better with his peers. Communicate better? How the hell was he supposed to communicate with people he couldn't even hear? I was about to say that, but then a loud ringing sound went off in my ear. The fire alarm started blaring right next to me, and everyone filed out in the usual chaos of an unexpected drill. I was already outside when I noticed those same guys huddled together, laughing nervously but trying to play It cool. They were talking about something, but I had too much on my mind to listen. The building was actually smoking. I'd never seen this before, because this wasn't actually a drill. We all stood outside watching it. When I heard one of them say, yo, we should probably tell someone now. I was listening. Gabe told them to be quiet, but another guy said, guys, we can't just leave him there. That fire is huge. I knew who him was immediately. I asked what they meant. Gabe had tears in his eyes. Ben still in there? We left him as a joke because he couldn't hear the alarm. The building was now engulfed in flames, windows shattering from the heat.

Why, it's in the corner of your room. I gestured toward the small medical waste bin while cradling the Newborn, who was struggling to breathe. Go ahead and toss it for me, please. She said it so casually, like she was asking me to throw away a tissue. What? Ma'am, this is your baby. I held the infant closer to my chest protectively. Look at it. The little turd is hardly alive. He can barely breathe. Just do us all a favor and throw it out. Her pupils were dilated and she kept scratching at her arms. Absolute not. I turned away from her and started checking the baby's vitals. I'd seen the track marks on her arms during delivery. The baby was born premature and underweight, with clear signs of neonatal abstinence syndrome. His little body was already going through withdrawal from whatever substances his mother had been using during pregnancy. He needed immediate medical intervention, not a trash can. The mother started getting agitated when I didn't comply. She sat up in the bed, despite having just given birth 20 minutes ago. Her hospital gown was soaked with sweat and blood, but she didn't seem to notice or care. The way she looked at her own child like he was garbage made my stomach turn. I knew I had to get this baby to the NICU immediately. His breathing was shallow and his skin had A bluish tint that worried me. Every second counted. But I also couldn't just walk out without following protocol. I needed to document everything and alert social services about the mother's request to dispose of her child. I'm going to take your son for treatment now. He needs oxygen and monitoring. I kept my voice calm and professional. The mother's eyes narrowed. She looked around the room like she was calculating something. Then her whole demeanor changed. Her face contorted into fake panic, and she started screaming at the top of her lungs. Help me! This woman is trying to hurt my baby! Her voice echoed down the hospital corridor. Within seconds, three other doctors rushed into the room. Doctor the Peters and Doctor Burton looked between me and the screaming mother, trying to assess the situation. Behind them, Nurse Melendez appeared, looking concerned. They all knew me, but they also had to respond to a mother's distress call about her Newborn. Put the baby down and return it to the mother. Doctor Peters used his authority voice. No! I'm trying to save this baby's life! She asked me to throw him in the trash can. She's not in a state to care for him. I held the infant tighter. The mother's performance escalated. Tears streamed down her face as she reached toward me with shaking hands. She's insane. Why would anyone want to throw out their baby? I looked desperately at my colleagues. They had to see through this. Act. The baby in my arms was barely breathing and needed immediate care. His mother was clearly high and had just asked me to dispose of him like medical waste. But the other doctors were looking at me strangely. Doctor de Burton stepped closer with his hands up, like he was approaching a dangerous animal. Gabriella, did you take your medication today? When we hired you, you promised to never miss a day of your medication. My heart sank. They thought I was having an episode. Five years ago, I'd had a brief mental health crisis. During my residency, I've been properly diagnosed and treated for bipolar disorder. I've been stable on medication ever since. But that history would always follow me. Now this manipulative woman was using it against me. I never

So we're three months from the wedding, and I make the mistake of telling my family we finally booked our venue. A big mistake. My mother in law immediately goes into interrogation mode. What's the theme? Is it rustic beach? I say it's a surprise, and she literally follows me to the bathroom door, going, I carried that boy for nine months. I deserve to know if I need waterproof mascara for three weeks. It escalates. My sister in law creates a group chat called Wedding Venue Detectives. My cousin starts checking venue parking lots for our cars. My mother in law accidentally opens our mail claiming she was looking for coupons. My aunt shows up at three different venues with my photo, asking if we have a reservation. The breaking point is this family dinner where my mother in law ambushes us with a laminated list saying, these are all possible venues within 50 miles. Just point. My sister adds, we need to know. I look at my husband, who mouths, just tell them like a broken man. I look at his mother with her Office Depot laminated list. My sister recording for Instagram, my cousin, who's been stalking parking lots. Something in me breaks. You want to know so badly? Fine. I stand up slowly and make eye contact with everyone. We're having our reception at McDonald's. I let that hang for three full seconds, watching their brains buffer Someone drops their fork. The one on Main Street with the Play Place. It goes that's not funny, but I'm stone faced. We already put down the deposit. My husband catches on, immediately nod seriously, the manager, Gary, is really excited. My sister's wine glass shatters on the floor. My mother in law asks about dinner and I go everyone gets Happy Meals, nuggets or Big Mac. No substitutions. My aunt starts crying you cannot feed my friends nuggets at your wedding! Meanwhile, my uncle practically throws his wallet at us asking if it's about money. I do a quick Google and show them someone did this already in 2,015. First dance under the golden arches, I say wistfully. My sister in law shrieks about her two hundred dollar shoes and how they just cannot touch a McDonald's floor. My husband commits fully. Instead of cake, we're doing an apple pie tower. Ronald McDonald is officiating. I add we're registered at McDonald's for gift cards. My mother in law looks at me with pure betrayal. What will Father Michael think when he finds out you're getting married by a clown next morning? My mother in law shows up with menu brochures. This barn is available! I'll pay for everything! I pull out the fake McDonald's catering menu I made at 3:00am. Too late. We customized our Mcflurry Bar. Oreo for my side, M&M for his. She grips the door frame. By day three, my cousin reveals they had an emergency Family meeting and created a Powerpoint to convince my husband and I to call off the McDonald's disaster. They called it Operation Real Venue with Slide 7 titled signs they've lost their Minds. Week two, my aunt calls crying that she can't tell her book club my knee.

My best friend asked me to quit my 180,000 dollar V P. Position to watch her kids because daycare is for people who don't have friends with maternal instincts and she could not miss her wine tasting certification course. Madison told me for years that I was meant to be a stay at home mom and a natural mother while dumping her children at my door every single day. Madison and I met at our first corporate jobs, where we both swore we'd be C E O s by 30. Then I had twins at 28 and everything changed for me overnight, while Madison kept climbing that ladder until she married a cardiac surgeon and retired at 20 9 to live her best life. The morning I told her I was leaving work to raise my kids, she hugged me and whispered, you're going to be such an amazing mother because you actually have those maternal instincts, unlike women like me who need more stimulation. When my husband got laid off and money got tight, she was the first to say staying home was still the right choice since I was so naturally nurturing and some women were just meant to be mothers. By the time my twins were two and I had my third baby, Madison had her first kid with her surgeon husband. Three weeks postpartum, she showed up at my door at six In the morning with her Newborn still covered in spit up, and announced, why would I pay strangers when my best friend is literally the best mother I know? Before I could answer, she was already backing out of my driveway in her new Range Rover, leaving her screaming baby in my arms while texting her personal trainer. Every morning became a hostage situation where Madison would ring my doorbell before dawn with her daughter and whatever emergency made it impossible for her to parent that day, from Pilates to brunches to urgent manicures that couldn't be rescheduled. When I suggested the elite daycare that her husband could definitely afford, she laughed and said, those places are where lazy parents abandon their children. But I have you. Why would I traumatize my baby with strangers? When Madison had her second baby, she didn't even pretend to consider childcare. You're literally glowing when you're surrounded by all these babies while I just feel trapped. So really, I'm doing you a favor by giving you more purpose in life. She dropped both kids with ear infections and stomach bugs while she attended charity luncheons where she'd complain about how exhausting motherhood was to women who actually watched their own children. She sent me midnight texts saying she needed me to take the kids for three days because her husband was at a medical conference and she absolutely had to join him, which I'd later see on Instagram was her at a Miami Spa resort while he worked while she posted champagne selfies. I was managing five kids through stomach flu and when I texted that her son had a fever of 103, she replied with a thumbs up emoji and asked if I could handle the weekend too since she booked a couple's massage. She threw elaborate birthday parties, taking credit for the Pinterest perfect decorations while telling other moms blessed she was to be so hands on even though I was doing everything while she got Botox. For six years, this was my life. While Madison remodeled her third house and posted about the struggles of being a stay at home mom. Her village that made it all possible, as she said in her posts, was literally just me watching her kids for free, including Christmas morning when she flew to Aspen because she desperately needed a break from the holidays. Everything shifted when my youngest started kindergarten and I had seven hours of freedom every weekday for the first time in six years. I updated my resume and started interviewing while Madison acted like I'd personally betrayed her by even suggesting I might want something beyond her childcare.

I smiled. I haven't heard of that one. Her words slurred from the laughing gas. It's when I hear daddy's car and everyone freezes like statues. My hygienist, Sierra, raised an eyebrow. That sounds interesting. How do you play? When we hear the garage, Mommy says statue time and we all freeze wherever we are, Isabella explained drowsily. Even if I'm eating or playing, everything stops. That's when I noticed the faint yellow marks on her upper arm, mostly hidden by her sleeve. Sometimes I'm really good at it. Last week I held my spoon in the air for 20 whole minutes. She seemed proud. Mommy said I was the best statue ever. Twenty minutes is a long time, I said, gently adjusting her sleeve to see better. Fingerprint bruises? Old ones. Can you raise your arm for me, sweetie? I need to adjust the chair. As she raised both arms, her shirt rode up. Linear marks crossed her lower back, some scarred, some fresh. What happens if someone moves during statue time? I kept working, acting like I was just doing my job. That's losing. Daddy doesn't like when we lose. Excuse myself to get a different tool, stepping to my computer to pull up our mandatory reporting protocols. When I returned, I asked casually, and if you win the statue game? If we're all good statues, daddy, Walks through and goes to his room. Then we can breathe normal again. Sometimes he even says good job and we get to eat dinner. You get to eat dinner? Only if we win. Losers don't deserve dinner. But mommy sneaks me crackers later. I made a show of checking Isabella's chart while secretly measuring the bruise patterns with my pen light. 3 2 cm spread on the grip marks. Adult male hand size. Isabella, what other games does your family play? I asked oceaning my hygiene to discreetly check on the father. The listening game, where he asks questions and we have to answer exactly right. I pulled out my light open wide again. What kind of questions? Like who's the most important person in this house? The answer is always daddy. The light revealed slight scarring on her inner cheek, likely from biting during stress. Happens when someone gets the answer wrong. Sometimes no breakfast or lunch. My tummy hurts so bad, but crying makes it worse. My least favourite one is the quiet room. I set down my tools. Tell me about this quiet room. While I set up this X ray. I positioned the lead apron, noting how she winced when I touched her shoulders. It's the closet under the stairs. No light. We stay until we're sorry enough. I count to know how long I lasted. My record is 10,000 seconds. What's yours? The excitement in her voice broke my heart. That was over two And a half hours. That's a lot of counting, Sierra returned, mouthing her dad's asking how much longer you'll be. Mommy went in there last week, Isabella continued. He had to fold up real small cause she's bigger. Daddy said she forgot who pays the bills. Sometimes I hear her crying in there, but I can't help or I go in too. We Learned that rule the hard way. I took the X rays, handed her some stickers, and said, I need to develop these. Sierra will stay with you in the hallway. I called CPS from my cell. Active abuse case. Child has physical marks. Describes systematic torture disguised as games. Father is in waiting room. Returning, I pretended to review her chart. Isabella, has anyone else seen you play these games? No, silly. It's a family secret.

Amelia threw herself onto her bed, still wearing the clothes I'd caught her in when she climbed back through her bedroom window at 2:00am. Two weeks grounded. Are you actually serious right now? She grabbed a pillow and screamed into it. I was just at Tyler's party. Everyone was there. Everyone except you because you weren't allowed to go. I. I stood in her doorway, exhausted from waiting up. You snuck out. That's the issue. She sat up, mascara smeared under her eyes. Sadie's mom would never do this. She literally called the school last week and lied about Sadie being sick. When she skipped, Amelia kicked off her shoes. She trusts Sadie to make her own choices. She doesn't treat her like a prisoner. That's not trust, Amelia. That. That's being a cool mom who actually has her daughter's back. She stood up, fists clenched. All I want is a mom who covers for me sometimes instead of punishing me for being a normal teenager. Why can't you be like her? That night, I couldn't sleep. Amelia's words kept echoing in my head. Maybe I was too strict. Maybe kids did need freedom to figure things out. Her dad had been the lenient one before the divorce and she'd always loved him more. Was I pushing her away? The next morning, I knocked on her door. School today, if you want, I'll Call you in sick. Amelia's jaw dropped. Wait, what? You said you wanted me to have your back, so I'm having your back. She skipped three days that week. I called the attendance office, each time faking a cough. Amelia has the flu. Friday night she stumbled home at 1:00am, clearly drunk. The old me would have lectured her until sunrise. Instead, I helped her to bed, left water and Advil on her nightstand. I mumbled, thanks, mom, before passing out. I'd lay awake terrified, but kept repeating what I read online. Teenagers need autonomy. Natural consequences teach better than punishment. The lies got easier. Amelia would text she was at the library, but her Instagram showed her at the mall. I'd see beer cans in her backpack and pretend not to notice natural consequences. I reminded myself she'll learn on her own. Amelia started coming home with hickeys, peoples dilated, smelling like weed. Her sweet friends stopped coming around. Now it was kids with tattoos and vape pens who never came inside, just honked from the driveway at midnight. But Amelia seemed thrilled with the new me. She kissed my cheek randomly, bragged to friends on the phone about how chill I was. My mom literally doesn't care what I do, I heard her say proudly. Those words should have been my wake up call. Instead, I smiled, thinking I'd finally gotten parenting right. Thursday night, Amelia texted at ten PM, sleeping over at Sadie's to study for bio Test. Her dad called immediately, voice tight with concern. School night sleepovers. Since when I kept my voice casual. She needs freedom. Remember, I already said yes. But at eleven PM, Sadie's mom called. Is Sadie at your house? She said she was studying with Amelia. My stomach dropped, but I heard myself lying. No, haven't seen her. Maybe they went to another friends. I hung up knowing both girls were lying. But I committed to this path. At 1:00am, Amelia texted again. Actually at a party staying with a friend from school. Her dad was at my door in 10 minutes demanding we get her. She's being honest with us now. We have to trust her. God, I was an idiot. At 3 a. M, my phone rang. Amelia's voice was tiny, terrified. Mom, please come get me. Please. She was sobbing so hard she could barely speak. I'm at this college party. These guys said they were seniors, but they're like 25. One won't let me leave his room. He keeps giving me drinks. I locked myself in the bathroom when he tried to. Her voice broke. Mom, I'm scared. I flew out the door speeding.

We had the weirdest rule in probably the entire state. No closed doors while changing clothes, ever. Not my bedroom door, not the bathroom, not even the closet. Teenagers hide tattoos all over their body if we let them, dad would say. Or they could be hiding pills in their pockets. My friends were horrified when they heard about it. Mickey came over once and watched me change from school clothes to normal ones right in the middle of our living room while dad sat there with his newspaper, glancing up every few seconds. That's so creepy, she whispered, and I wanted to disappear. My older brother had already escaped to college, partly because of rules like this. I counted days until I could leave, too. Mom tried to help without directly challenging dad. She couldn't change his mind about the rule, but she found ways around it. The shower has frosted glass, I mentioned one day while folding towels. You're only visible as a shadow. She also helped me rearrange my room, putting my full length mirror at an angle where it looked like you could see everything from the doorway, but there was actually a blind spot. Perfect for 30 second wardrobe changes. I got really good at it, too. I kept spare clothes in the bathroom and changed when dad was busy watching TV. Mom would create distractions, calling dad to fix something right when I Needed to change for school. For weeks, this worked perfectly. Dad thought he was enforcing his rules since doors stayed open. He even bragged to his co workers about how his visibility system kept me safe. But then one weekend, everything exploded. And ways I never imagined. Dad's colleague Rob came by to drop off work files. Dad was on a video call in his office. Mom was grocery shopping, and I just gotten home from track with my entire body sweating. I couldn't wait for Dad's call to end, so I ducked behind my mirror. Blind spot, like always. But Rob didn't know our house layout. He was looking for Dad's office and saw what looked completely wrong from his angle. A teenage girl hiding behind furniture to undress. He looked away immediately, but asked me a question that sounded oddly serious. Where's your father? I pointed to Dad's office, and he took off through the door. I heard him say, Jim, your daughter was hiding behind furniture to change clothes. Combined with these visibility rules you mentioned. Dad came out confused at first. She knows the rules about doors. Rob shook his head. Jim, she was hiding behind furniture to change. That is not okay. You're making her feel unsafe. The way he said it made Dad's face go pale from realization. By the next morning, everything was chaos. Rob, being a mandated reporter, had called CPS overnight. Two social workers showed up before breakfast asking to speak With me. Privately, they separated us into different rooms. Dad in the kitchen, me in the living room, mom in the bedroom. Can you explain the rules about changing clothes in your house? The woman asked gently. I'm just not allowed to close doors, I said. Not even while changing clothes? She wrote something down. So you felt the need to hide behind furniture because your dad doesn't give you privacy? I tried explaining the mirror trick, but it sounded worse out loud. So you developed evasion strategies to change clothes. She kept on writing in her notepad. Then they brought dad in. Sir, can you explain why your daughter cannot have privacy while changing? Dad's voice shook. It's just not closing doors for her safety. Kids hide all kinds of stuff. It's her body, the woman finished. And you think watching her prevents her from what? Being a delinquent? Dad nodded frantically. You require visual confirmation of your 16 year old

I stared at my phone screen, reading it three times. Mom and dad had been separated for six months. The custody battle was getting ugly. I was 14, splitting time between their apartments and everything felt broken. Then my phone buzzed again. Call me now. Mom's voice was desperate when I answered. Did you see my text? Yeah. What the hell are you asking me to do? Your father is winning. His lawyer destroyed me in court today. I need evidence that you're not safe with him. My chest tightened. Mom, you want me to fake suicide notes? Not a suicide note, a journal entry. The therapist appointment is tomorrow. Doctor Rossi needs to see that you have these thoughts at his place. Her voice got urgent. Write that you stare at his sleeping pills count and you think about taking them when he's asleep. Mom, stop. Listen to me. If I don't get full custody, your father loses his health insurance. Through my job, you know he needs insulin. It's $800 a month without coverage. She paused. He's already rationing. You've seen it. You can't use his diabetes against me. I'm using it for him. If you write this, I get custody and I'll keep him on my insurance for the whole year. Even after the divorce, I sat on my bed feeling sick. Dad had been rationing his insulin. I've seen him skip doses, checking his blood sugar obsessively, trying to stretch his supplies. Last week, his hands were shaking so bad he couldn't open a water bottle. I can't write that I want to die. You're not actually suicidal. It's just words on paper. Write that. Being at his apartment makes you feel hopeless, that you think about ending it, that you wonder if anyone would care. She was crying, now, please for his help. The next morning, she showed up at Dad's apartment while he was at work. She handed me a notebook and a folded paper. Copy this in your handwriting. I opened her notes. The words made me nauseous. I think about ending it. I wonder if anyone would care. When I'm at his apartment, I imagine taking all 47 of his pills, he wouldn't find me until morning. Mom, this is insane. This is necessary. Your therapist already knows you keep a journal. I told her last week you've been writing concerning things. My stomach dropped. You already told her. Just copy it. Please think about your father going into diabetic coma, dying. You want that on your conscience. She left the papers on my desk. The appointment is at 3. I'll pick you up at 2:30. I sat there for an hour, pen in hand. Mom wasn't wrong about Dad's health. Last month, he collapsed at work. The paramedics said his blood sugar was at 340. The hospital Bill was $3,000 just for That one visit without insurance, he'd die. Maybe a lie about wanting to die could keep him alive. I picked up the pen, started copying the first line. Then I stopped and put the pen down, picked up my phone and took pictures of every page she'd written, every horrible word she wanted me to claim as mine. At 2:30, mom arrived. Did you do it? I handed her the blank notebook. What is this? That's my journal. It's empty. Yeah, it is. Her face went red. The appointment is in 30 minutes. Need to do this now. I'm not writing suicide notes about dad. She grabbed my shoulders. Please, I'm begging you. Just tell Doctor Rossi you have these thoughts at his place. You don't need to write anything. Just say it. Say you've thought about the pills. I'm not lying about wanting to die. You're killing your father by not doing this. No, mom, you're killing me by asking. Doctor Rossi's office was too warm. Mom sat next to me, her leg bouncing against mine. So Doctor Rossi said, your mother tells me you've been journaling about some.

I found out the day of their anniversary. I drove up expecting a Celebration and instead found blood staining the front door and the window smashed. Inside, I saw Rebecca sitting on the couch getting her face stitched up, while my cousin Terry, who everyone teased for being a standoffish pacifist, stood with bleeding knuckles and a stone cold face. Terry, what have you done? Grandma was screaming while clutching her chest. Living room looked like a bare knuckle boxing ring. Blood splattered across anniversary decorations, shattered glass everywhere. You're going to prison. Uncle Pete was dialing 9 1 1. Look at her face. Twenty relatives descended on Terry like vultures. Your brother's wife, Cousin John, grabbed Terry's shirt on their anniversary. Rebecca sobbed, blood running down her dress. He grabbed me by the hair, slammed my face into the table. I thought he was going to call me, but something was wrong. Dave sat frozen in the corner, his own wife brutalized, and he just stared at the floor, not moving, not speaking, not even looking at her. Dave, why aren't you. Aunt Linda started. He knows why. Terry said quietly, the room exploded. There's no excuse. You're an animal. How could you hit a woman? But Dave still didn't move. After 10 minutes of everyone screaming at Terry, threatening him, calling police, someone finally asked Terry why. Terry finally answered, she's been beating Dave for Three years! Liar! Rebecca lurched forward, but Uncle Pete held her back. Remember Christmas when Dave had that broken rib? She hit him with a baseball bat while he slept. The work scars on his back. She threw boiling water on him. If she hit him, why did he never fight back? Cousin John asked sarcastically. Terry pulled out his phone and Rebecca's voice filled the room. Try to leave and I'll tell everyone you molested Liam. I'll bruise myself up, tear my clothes and Christ the goose assault to the police. Who will they believe, Dave, the sobbing woman or the man? People's faces turned, but the recording continued. You eat when I say, you sleep where I say. Dave's voice cut through. Please just let me spend time with my boy. Then Rebecca shooting back, you see Liam only when I allow it. Or I make one phone call and you never see him again. I have friends who'll testify they saw you hit me. The tension in the room grew. Uncle Pete slowly let go of Rebecca's arm, stepping back. Grandma turned to Rebecca. You threatened. And him? Rebecca tried to speak, but Aunt Linda cut her off. All those times Dave had bruises, that was you. Why didn't anyone tell us? Mom asked, looking around. I did tell you! Terry's voice exploded. I told you about the bruises. You said couples fight. I told grandma about the cigarette burns. She said Dave needs to man up. I begged Uncle Pete when I saw the burn marks. He said, not our business. Mom's hand covered her mouth. Oh god, you did tell me. Grandma looked at the floor. I thought men should handle their own problems. Went to the police three times, Terry continued. They said Dave had to file the complaint himself. So he tried. Then she showed up at the station with self inflicted bruises on her arms. They nearly arrested him. After that, he never tried again. Aunt Linda stepped away from Rebecca. Jesus Christ, Rebecca, how could you? Dave was almost in tears when he stood up and slowly lifted his shirt. Cigarette burns covered his ribs and long scars on his stomach. The room gasped. Uncle Pete pointed at Rebecca. You did this! You burned him! This is what she did. Because I tried to report it. Rebecca's mask was cracking. You pathetic little. But there's something else even more disgusting. Everyone froze completely. What do you mean? I whispered. Liam came to me a few days ago.

The principal stops reading my college rejection letter, my third one this week, and looks up at me. Your GPA is excellent, she reads, frowning at her screen. But it says here you have zero extracurriculars. I explained to her that I stay after school every day to help other students, but the principal frowns, saying, the activities log shows you've never joined a single club or done even an hour of community service. I tell her I'm literally in room 2:03 until 6:30 p m. Every day, sometimes until 9 during playoffs. Just ask Mister Hayes. She pulls up security footage on her computer, and there I am in room 2 0 3 with five varsity football players, including our state champion quarterback, writing five different essays while they're on their phones. The principal's face goes white as she asks me, you're doing their homework? I'm confused. I explained to her that Mister Hayes says it's pure tutoring for my college application, but she types something into her laptop and turns the screen toward me, saying, there's no record of any tutoring program in our system. My mouth goes dry, and I feel my stomach dropped through the floor because I've been doing this for three years, every single day after school, all while Mister Hayes told me Harvard loves students who help athletes succeed. However, I can only assume Harvard doesn't love students who do athletes Homework for them. The principal calls in the guidance counselor, who pulls my record, saying, you've missed every college prep meeting. I explained that Mister Hayes said the tutoring was more important. The counselors fingers freeze over the keyboard. The counselor asks, did you write your own college essays yet? And I tell them that I started them. Mister Hays said they needed editing. She asked me if he edited them, and I admit no. He said I should focus on helping the team first. The counselor's face goes pale and she grips the edge of the desk as she says, you missed your own deadline, helping others meet theirs. But I defend him, my voice getting smaller, saying Mister Hays says the team brings in thousands of dollars to the school, and my grades are good enough as is. I should help those who have a lower chance of success. The principal shakes her head and something in her eyes makes my chest tight as she says, your grades are excellent, but colleges rejected you because you're a ghost with no activities, no personality, no recommendations that aren't about how helpful you are to others, just grades. That's when it hits me like a punch to the stomach. I realized I spent so much time writing everyone else's story, I forgot to write my own. Mister Hayes freezes in the doorway when he sees us, his coffee cup halfway to his lips, and he tries to turn around and Leave. But the principal calls him in, asking about his tutoring program. Mr. Hays sets down his coffee and acts casual, saying, oh, she's our best tutor. So helpful to everyone. Then the principal turns her laptop toward him, showing the security footage, and his face change, just completely, going from fake smile to cornered animal. He says, those students need support. They have learning differences. His voice is getting higher, saying, do you know how much the sports program brings in? Then he turns to me, desperate now, saying, tell them how much you love helping. Tell them. But I stay silent. And for the first time in three years, I don't defend him. The counselor is in Mister Hayes's face. You told a student this would help their college applications? The principal's pen snaps in her hand as she tells him, doing homework for others isn't community service, it's academic fraud. Then Mister

I was 22 when I applied for my dream job. Standard background check, they said, no big deal. Then HR called me a week later, said there were red flags with my application. Said there was a gap in my dad's employment history that concerned them. The same dad who always bragged about his perfect career trajectory? The same dad who said we moved when I was 12 for his big ocean. I told HR it must be some confusion. My dad was a successful construction worker. But they suggested I look into it before proceeding. I googled my dad's name with our Old Town. First result was a newspaper archive from 2,014. It said our local youth coach was under investigation for misconduct. My dad's face staring back at me. Click link after link. Parents demanded answers at emergency school meetings. One said second student comes forward. Third allegation rock soccer program. Every article dated the exact week we left. Dad had said the promotion opportunity came up suddenly, so we had to leave immediately or he'd lose it. Mom cried for three states straight. I thought she was sad about leaving her friends. The articles painted a clear timeline. March 3rd, first complaint filed. March 8th, school suspended him from coaching. March 15th, police opened investigation. March 18th, we moved. No forwarding address, no goodbye parties, no nothing. Just gone. The last article was from March 20th. Suspect in youth abuse case disappears. They Use the word suspect. My dad was a suspect. The reporter included a quote from a parent. He knew we were onto him. Back up and ran like a coward he is. Those boys deserve justice. I called the newspaper, asked for the reporter who covered the story. She still work there? Remembered everything. Said my dad was the assistant coach for three different teams. Multiple boys came forward independently. They had similar stories about private training sessions. The detective was building a case when we vanished. One family hired a private investigator, but trail went cold in Nevada. We lived in Nevada for six months before moving to Arizona. Dad said it was for tax purposes. Public records request got me the police files. Three boys gave statements, ages 11, 12, and 13. Detailed accounts of what happened in the equipment room after practice. What happened in my dad's car during rides home. What happened during tournament, hotel stays. One boy's statement mentioned me. I was always around, but never knew. My dad would buy us both ice cream afterward. He had to watch me laugh and eat my cone while he felt sick. That boy was Preston, my best friend. He suddenly stopped coming over that last month. Mom said his family was dealing with personal issues. I confronted my dad with everything. Printed out 40 pages of articles, police reports, witness statements. He went pale, started stammering about misunderstandings. And I showed him Preston statement. The one That mentioned me. The one that described specific dates, times, places he broke. Admitted everything. Said he had a problem and got help. He said that's why he never coached again, never volunteered, never came to my school events. He was keeping himself away from kids. Mom sat there.

But she wasn't laughing when I took her literally. I've been married to Lisa for five years. I'm an engineer making 78 k. She's a nurse practitioner making 82 k. Always pulled our money together into joint accounts. Last month, Lisa comes home from her girls night all excited. Babe Sarah and Jen both have separate finances with their husbands. We're both doing so well financially. What if we each just handle our own expenses? More independence, you know, more modern. Honestly, it sounded reasonable. We're both adults making decent money. Why not? Sure, let's split everything, 50, 50, rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, everything. She seemed a bit surprised by how specific I was getting. Well, I meant more like we each pay for our own stuff. You handle the bills you want, I handle mine. More flexible. Red flag, but I agreed anyway. Maybe she had a point about flexibility. So the next day I sat down with our budget and divided everything perfectly down the middle. Rent one, $400 each. You utilities, $150 each. Internet, $50 each. Groceries, $400 each. Insurance, $200 each. Car payments, gas, personal expenses, all separate. I made a nice little spreadsheet and showed her. She said, wow, okay, very thorough, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Here's what I didn't expect. Lisa is absolutely terrible with money, always has been. I just never noticed because I've been handling all our finances. For five years, never had to budget or track expenses. Week 2, hey babe, can you cover utilities this month? I bought this amazing Korean skincare set that was on sale. I'll pay you back next week. Week 3, my half of rent is gonna be a few days late. Had to get my car detailed and got those highlights I've been wanting. You don't mind covering me, right? Week 4, can you grab groceries this week? I'm a little short until payday. Work has been so stressful. I deserve that shopping trip. I started keeping track of every loan in my phone just out of curiosity. Meanwhile, I'm actually thriving without her impulse purchases draining our joint account. I'm investing my leftover money, started putting $800 a month into index funds, something I never could do before because money would just disappear. Peer month two, she owes me one I ton and $50 in temporary loans, rent, utilities, groceries, even her portion of our anniversary dinner at that expensive steakhouse she insisted on trying. It's just temporary, babe. Once I get my spending under control and figure out this whole budgeting thing. But it's actually getting worse instead of better. She's buying a hundred and fifty dollar Lululemon sets, three different subscription boxes, constantly eating out for lunch instead of packing like she used to. Getting her nails done every two weeks at $80 a pop. She makes $4,000 more per year than me, but somehow always comes up Completely short. Month three, she's sitting at our kitchen table at eleven PM crying actual tears because her credit card is maxed out at 4,000 dollars. She can't make her 320 dollar car payment that's due tomorrow. And according to my phone notes, she owes me exactly 3,400 dollar total. I don't understand how this happened. I make good money. I should have way more left over than you do. I pulled out my phone and open my investment app, turn the screen toward her. 20 eight hundred dollars built up in just three months even while covering most of her expenses and maintaining my own lifestyle. This is absolutely crazy, she said, staring at the screen like it was displaying alien hieroglyphics. You're like actually wealthy now. How are you?

My jaw dropped at my friend's audacity. Chuck is literally such a freaking loser. I don't know why we kept inviting him to things, Serena said, rolling her eyes when I asked where he was. But he's been our friend since college, I said. Nate groaned. That's exactly the problem. We all went to the same college, and now he's stuck working at target. It's embarrassing. Dan nodded. Last time he was here, he ordered water and the cheapest thing on the menu. But you guys order water, too? Sometimes, I argued. Serena slid her Ray Bans down and stared at me with a bored expression. We're 27 now. It's time to upgrade to better friends. As if that Sunday brunch wasn't horrifying enough, that same night when Chuck texted the group chat saying, hey guys, really need someone to talk to, Serena made a separate group chat just to mock him. Ten bucks says he needs money, not a talk. Just don't respond. We're not his ATM. They laughed at him in the chat. I made sure to call him secretly. Hey, Chuck, what's up? Chuck sniffled. Just a terrible time right now. I. My mom's test results came back from the hospital. Stage three. My eyes widened. Okay, stay where you are. I'm headed over to your house. I spent that night at Chuck's place. We drank cheap beer and watched old comedy specials while his mom slept. Upstairs, Chuck didn't cry again, just kept saying it is what it is every time his voice started to waver. In the morning, I texted the group chat. The one without Chuck asking. Hey, could you guys come over to Chuck's place? His mom's seriously sick and he could use some friends. But Serena, Nate, and Dan all made different excuses not to go there for him. I'm busy on this presentation. I have a networking event today. Sorry, can't need sleep. Chuck smiled, saying that it's fine. But it wasn't. Over the next few weeks, as Chuck's mom got worse, so did my friends. When Chuck posted a gofundme for medical bills, Serena screenshot it in our separate chat. Called it I knew he wanted money. She reported it as a scam. Nate saw Chuck at the grocery store and literally hid behind the cereal aisle. I can't deal with his sob story right now. He texted us with a selfie of him crouching behind cans of spam. Dan went further. He unfriended Chuck on everything. I don't need that negativity in my feed, he said at brunch while showing us his vacation photos. Besides, it's manipulative how he keeps posting about his mom. We get it, she's sick. Does he really need to bring down the mood with that? Like, let me doom scroll through Hot Girls in Peace. Nate burst out into laughter at his comment. Serena smirked, unfriending him too. I felt sick. How could things Have gotten so different since college. Chuck's mom passed that same week. I attended his funeral. Sat in the front row with his co workers. Almost 100 people came out to support, all boasting about Chuck and his mom's kindness, while our Three Stooges, Nate, Serena, Dan were nowhere. I thought they'd at least text, Chuck said quietly. But Karma soon caught up with them and hit each person with a vengeance. Nate went first. Panic attack during a million dollar presentation. Full breakdown. Crying, hyperventilating. Had to be carried out on a stretcher in front of the entire board. When he texted the group chat asking for someone to help him with his panic attack, no one responded. Serena was next. After working 22 hours straight, she sent her clients confidential files to their competitor, five

When I was 17, my older brother Matthew was diagnosed with kidney disease. This wasn't completely unexpected. He'd been feeling unwell for months. We all thought it was just stress from college. The diagnosis changed everything. The doctors explained he would need a transplant within a year. Our parents immediately got tested, but neither was compatible. My sister Barbara, who is 22 and living across the country, flew home to get tested, too. She wasn't a match, either. That left me and our cousins, aunts and uncles. Everyone agreed to get tested. I didn't think much about what it would mean if I was a match. I just went to the hospital with my mom, gave blood samples, and went through a physical exam. Two weeks later, the transplant coordinator called our house. I picked up because everyone else was out. You're a potential match for Matthew, she said. We need you to come in for additional testing. I hung up and sat at the kitchen table for an hour, not moving. When my mom came home with groceries, I told her. She put the bags down and started making calls to my dad and Barbara. The additional testing was more intense. They explained all the risks. Complications from surgery, potential long term effects, recovery time. I would miss at least three weeks of school during my senior year. There was also a small chance my remaining Kidney could fail someday, which would put me in Matthew's position. I didn't tell any of my friends what was happening. Sylvia, my best friend since elementary school, knew something was wrong, but stopped asking when I changed the subject repeatedly. I didn't want advice or sympathy. This wasn't a decision I could crowd source. My parents were careful not to pressure me. It has to be your choice, my dad said during dinner one night. That made it harder somehow. Part of me wanted them to just tell me what to do. The hardest part was talking to Matthew. He wouldn't discuss it. When I brought it up, he changed the subject or left the room. One night, I cornered him in the kitchen when everyone else was asleep. If you don't want my kidney, just say so. He looked at me for a long time. I don't want you to regret this when you're older. That was the first time I considered that this decision would affect my entire life, not just the next few months. I was planning to go to college next year. How would surgery affect that? What about playing soccer, which I loved? What about future health insurance costs? What if I had kids someday who needed a kidney? My cousin Jonathan came over one evening to play video games with Matthew. Afterward, he pulled me aside. My dad donated a kidney to his brother 15 years ago. He's never regretted it, but he Says it wasn't simple. Jonathan's dad was my uncle Dexter, who I rarely saw because he lived on the West Coast. I hadn't known about his donation. The transplant team wanted an answer soon. Matthew's kidney function was declining faster than they'd initially projected. I made a spreadsheet listing pros and cons, which felt ridiculous for a decision this big. The pro column had one entry. Matthew lives. Conclusion had a dozen entries about my future. One Saturday, I ran into my math teacher, Missus Carla Peters, at the grocery store. She asked why I seemed distracted in class. Without planning to, I told her everything. She listened without interrupting. When I was 16, my parents asked if I would quit school to help support the family, she said I said no. And I've always wondered what would have happened if I'd said yes. That wasn't exactly helpful either. But it made me realize something. There was no perfect answer. Whatever I decided, I'd always wonder about the other path. The day I turned seventeen and a/2, I called the transplant coordinator and told her I would do it. The surgery was scheduled for the following month. When I told my parents, they hugged me so hard I couldn't breathe. Which made me realize they hadn't been as neutral as they pretended. Matthew found me in my room that night. He sat on my bed and handed me an envelope. Inside was a letter he'd written detailing all the things he planned. To do with his life, if the transplant worked. It was the most he'd communicated with me in months. If you change your mind, that's okay, he said. But I didn't change my mind two days before the surgery.

My girlfriend Diana broke up with me after three years, saying I was emotionally unavailable and she needed someone more passionate, more present. You're always distracted, Jake. I feel like I'm dating a ghost. When we talk, you're somewhere else. When we make plans, you cancel last minute with some lame excuse. I can't keep doing this anymore. I deserve better than whatever this is. She was absolutely right. I had been distant, barely listening during conversations, constantly checking my phone during dinner dates, canceling our weekend plans with weak excuses about being tired or having urgent work stuff that couldn't wait. What she didn't know was the real reason behind everything. For the past eight months, I've been secretly caring for my mom, who was going through aggressive chemotherapy treatments for state stage 3 breast cancer. Every single day after work, I drive two hours across town to her house, help her with doctor appointments, manage her complex medication schedule, clean her house, grocery shop, and make sure she was eating enough to keep strength up during treatment. Mom made me swear on everything I held dear not to tell anyone about her diagnosis. She was absolutely terrified of people treating her differently, looking at her with those pitying eyes. Or worse, her boss finding out and pushing her toward early retirement before she was financially ready. I don't want to be the cancer lady, Jake. She Say, while I helped her with her weekly pill organizer. I wanna fight this battle quietly and get back to my normal life without everyone thinking I'm fragile or broken. So instead of explaining to Diana why I was constantly exhausted and emotionally drained, I became the mysterious, unavailable boyfriend who seemed to care more about unknown commitments than nurturing our relationship. Diana moved out on a Tuesday morning, taking her plants and half our furniture. By Friday night, she was already posting Instagram stories from fancy restaurants with Derek from her marketing team. Within two weeks, they were Facebook official with matching couple photos. Her social media transformed into a carefully curated highlight reel of romantic sunset dinners, spontaneous weekend getaways to wine country, and heartfelt captions about finally discovering authentic love with someone who actually shows up consistently and puts genuine effort into the relationship. Meanwhile, I was spending my evenings in sterile hospital waiting rooms, holding my mom's trembling hand during her chemotherapy infusion sessions and lying to concerned friends who kept asking why Diana and I had suddenly broken up after seeming so happy together. Two months after the breakup, Mom's latest blood work came back completely clear. The oncologist said she'd beaten the cancer entirely and could start planning for her future again. At her remission Celebration dinner at her favorite Italian restaurant, Diana's younger sister Claire happened to be there. Turns out she'd recently started working at Mom's Insurance Company, and they developed a Close friendship during Mom's treatment period, bonding over their shared love of mystery novels. Claire sees the Celebration photos on my Instagram story and immediately starts connecting dots in her head. She realizes.

So I started treating him like my actual father. I've been killing myself for five years at my job when Jimmy, my boss, called me into his office on a random Tuesday. Kevin, we're demoting you, he said, not even looking up from his MacBook. My heart stopped. I've never been late, handed in my work on time. It just didn't make sense. Your position is being given to my nephew, Bartholomew. He just graduated and needs leadership experience. My coffee went cold in my hand. You're demoting me to make room for your nephew? You'll be supporting him. But, hey, that's what family does. We help each other out. We're all family here, remember? I just closed on a house based on my senior developer salary, my mortgage. Family makes sacrifices, Kevin. Bartholomew needs this opportunity. And family support each other unconditionally. Plus, I need you working weekends. The whole team does. Family doesn't watch the clock. I stared at the motivational poster behind him. Family. Together, we achieve more. Right? Family. He beamed. See? I knew you'd understand. Family values are what make this company special. Monday morning, I walked straight into Jimmy's office without knocking. Morning, dad, I announced cheerfully, plopping down in his chair while he was getting coffee. Family doesn't need appointments, right? His face went red. Kevin, this is highly unprofessional. But we're family. You said so yourself. Can I borrow your Tesla This weekend? Jimmy gripped His coffee mug so tight, his knuckles went white. At lunch, I started eating his meal from the executive fridge. Jimmy stormed into the breakroom. It's my lunch! My mom always said, family shares everything. Your salmon tastes great, by the way. I took another bite while maintaining eye contact. He yanked the container away, breathing heavily. Tuesday, I submitted an official request to HR for tuition reimbursement. Jimmy is like a father to me. Said so. And my dad paid for my sister's MBA. HR called Jimmy immediately. He showed up at my desk red faced. We don't have a tuition program. But dad, family supports each other's growth. You supported Bartholomew's growth into my job. His jaw twitched. The court quarterly board meeting made his forehead vein throb. When he introduced me to investors, I interrupted, actually, this is my dad, Jimmy. The investors looked confused. Jimmy smile became manic. Kevin's joking. Dad's been having memory issues lately. I stage whispered. Jimmy's face went purple. The entire room went silent. I started calling him dad in every email CC in the entire company. At at that point, everyone called him Dad. Jimmy sent 17 emails demanding I stop. I replied all each time. Dad's cranky today. Someone needs a nap. When Bartholomew struggled with basic coding, I loudly announced, don't worry, Bartholomew. Grandpa Jimmy didn't hire you for your skills. That's what family nepotism is for. Jimmy burst from his office conference room. Now during his 20 minute Lecture about professionalism. I just kept nodding. You're right, dad. Family should communicate better. By Thursday, I brought my laundry to work. Dad. The machine at my apartment broke. Mind if I use yours? I started folding underwear during his client call. Then I asked his secretary for Jimmy's Netflix password because family shares streaming services. By week two, others joined in. Kelly from accounting started calling him papa Jimmy and asked for college tuition reimbursement. My real dad paid for my education. Caleb from IT brought his kids to the office. Uncle Jimmy can babysit while I code, right? That's what family does. His assistant said she'd never seen him take three Advil at once before. The hospital called him the following week. Mister Jimmy, you're listed as Kevin's emergency contact and next of kin. He's fine. Just need someone to sign these forms. He drove there furious, only to find me getting a routine check up. Families take care of each other's medical decisions, dad. By week three, Jimmy was cracking

My brother inherited everything. I quietly canceled all transfers. I'm Brett, 32, and I built my contracting business from absolute zero. Started with a beat up truck and borrowed tools, working 16 hour days until my hands bled. Now I've got 12 employees and we're booked solid through next spring. My younger brother, Bryce, different story entirely. He's 27 and has never held a job longer than eight months. Bryce is the type who shows up to family dinners and designer clothes he can't afford, talking about his next big opportunity while I'm still wearing work boots with concrete dust on them. For the past three years, I've been automatically transferring $20,800 every month to my parents account. Mom called it helping with the mortgage during tough times. Dad mentioned rising property taxes and medical bills. Never questioned it because they're my parents and 20 eight hundred dollars felt like the least I could do. But sitting in this mahogany paneled conference room listening to their state attorney read through their will, I realized how naive I'd been. Bryce inherits the house, all investment accounts and life insurance policies, the lawyer stated. Matter of factly, Brett receives the tools in the garage and your grandmother's China set, tools and China after three years of mortgage payments. It seems like an oversight, I said calmly, though my chest was tightening. My mother shifted uncomfortably. Brett, Honey, Bryce needs more support. Than you do. You've always been so independent and success. Bryce needs security, my father added. You've got your business, your house, your whole life figured out. Bryce is still finding his way. Finding his way at 27 after I'd started my business at 26 with nothing but determination. Can you explain what this mortgage is that I've been paying? I asked the lawyer directly. He flipped through documents. Your parents took out a 275 thousand dollar mortgage on their previously debt free home three years ago. Monthly payment is 20 eight hundred dollars. My stomach dropped. Their house had been paid off since I was in high school. What was the $275,000 used for? Bryce squirmed. Mom answered quickly. Bryce's Sports Bar downtown, great location, lots of potential. His fourth business venture after the failed food truck, online clothing store and cryptocurrency consulting company, each funded by our parents, each ending in spectacular failure. So you took out a mortgage on your paid off house to fund Bryce's business. Had me pay that mortgage for three years without telling me. And now you're leaving everything to Bryce, including the house I've essentially been buying for him. That's very uncharitable, my mother said defensively. I stood up slowly. You're absolutely right. I don't need your help. I never have. I walked out without another word. That evening, I sat in my home office looking at my laptop. Three clicks would cancel the automatic transfer that had been quietly draining my Business account for three years. I clicked cancel. Then I called my mortgage broker about those investment properties I've been considering. With an extra 20 eight hundred dollars per month, I could easily handle the payments. Three weeks later, mom texted Brett. The mortgage.

I was marinating ribs at 6:00am when Lexi texted me, you're uninvited. We don't want you there. No explanation, just a cold dismissal from the person who never lifted a finger for these reunions. For eight years, I've been the backbone of every family gathering. I brought the smoker, bought all the alcohol, coordinated everything. Lexie just showed up and took credit while I did the actual work. She'd waltz in wearing some designer dress, pose for photos and act like she organized everything. While I was sweating over a hot grill, I stared at that text, hands covered in marinade, and typed back, fine, I'm taking my barbecue and drinks with me. An hour later, my phone exploded, 15 missed calls from cousins, uncles, everyone panicking. Wait, you're not coming? What about the food? Lexi said you bailed on us. My voicemail was completely full. Text after text rolled in. Please tell me you're joking. The reunion won't be the same without your brisket. What happened? That's when I realized Lexi's fatal mistake. She never told them she uninvited me. She just announced I canceled, left them scrambling with no backup plan. Classic Lexi, creating problems and expecting everyone else to solve them. I texted my cousin Matthew, Lexi uninvited me, but you're welcome at my place. I've got everything we need. Matthew immediately called back. Absolutely Furious. She did what? That's completely insane. I'm coming over and bringing everyone I can convince. Within minutes, half the family was choosing my backyard over Lexi's disaster. Even the neighbours wanted in. When word spread about the impromptu cookout happening on my street, my phone kept buzzing with acceptances. Uncle Hank on my way with the cornhole boards and my famous hot sauce. Cousin Liz bringing my potato salad and the good folding chairs. Even my elderly Aunt Diana said she'd rather come to mine because that girl has no business running anything important. By 10:00am, I had people showing up to help set up. My neighbour Jeff brought his outdoor speakers and string lights. The kids from down the street asked if they could use my pool. This was turning into something way bigger than any family reunion we'd ever had. Lexi started calling around noon, completely panicked. Where is everyone? Only six people showed up and I ordered food for 30. I could hear the desperation and anger in her voice. She tried to exclude me but ended up excl including herself from the real party. By one PM, I had 43 people at my house, the biggest party I've ever thrown. The ribs were falling off the bone. The beer was ice cold and everyone kept thanking me for saving their weekend kid. It was splashing in the pool. Adults were playing cards and the whole neighborhood smelled like heaven. Meanwhile, Aunt Diana called me laughing. Lexi's reunion is a complete disaster. She ordered pizza for 30 people and only has six there, including herself. She's blaming everyone but herself and having a complete meltdown in front of what's left of the family. The best part, three more family showed up uninvited because they heard through the neighborhood Grapevine about the legendary barbecue.

If they didn't have enough money on their account, they would get a cheese sandwich instead. Friend that got a free lunch that would come back and say, Miss Debbie, I'm still hungry.

Like we're talking about a man who buys generic cereal and then pours it into name brand boxes so the neighbors think we eat the good stuff. He drives a BMW that's literally held together with duct tape and prayers. He parks it at the front of the driveway so everyone can see it anyway. I'm a senior in high school and college application season is here. All my friends are talking about where they're applying and their parents are stressing about tuition costs. Meanwhile, my dad keeps making these weird comments about how I better figure out my future because money doesn't grow on trees. But he never actually said he wouldn't pay for college, so I just assumed he would. Big mistake. I applied to my dream school and got accepted with a partial scholarship. I was so pumped and ran downstairs to tell my parents. My mom was excited and started crying happy tears, but my dad just looked at me and said, that's nice, honey. Hope you can afford it. I was confused and asked what he meant. He shrugged and said college was my responsibility now that I was becoming an don't. I felt my stomach drop. This man had literally never told me I'd be paying for college myself. We'd never had that conversation. I Was so angry and hurt that I decided to be petty about it. If you wanted to embarrass me, I'd return the favor. The next week was my 18th birthday party at our house. All my relatives were there, plus some family friends and neighbors. My dad loves showing off in front of people, so he was in his element, talking about his successful business and giving everyone financial advice. That's when I struck. During the cake cutting, I stood up and tapped my fork against my glass like I was making a toast. Everyone got quiet and looked at me. I smiled real big and said, thanks, everyone, for coming to celebrate with me. I just wanted to share some exciting news about my future. My dad looked proud, probably thinking I was about to thank him or something. I got into my dream college with a scholarship, which is amazing, because my dad just told me he's not helping pay for my education at all.

The op later confirmed the news story was indeed about his wife and children. Horrendously sad. 2, the one where a dying mother told her teen that she was the product of an affair. Reddit encouraged the girl to tell her dad the truth. She took the advice and he kicked her out. Since he was the legal father, the state made him take her back in and he reacted by making life really difficult for the girl who by this point had no one else. She posted one last time on a sub about suicide saying that she'd taken something to end her life. 3, that dude that shot his dick off, cooked it and ate it, you slash worthless. 3, 19. 4 I don't remember the sub.

Two, the Dunbar armored robbery, the largest cash heist in US history. A six man inside job to rob an armored cash depot. They set up a house party as an alibi, use the keys to get into the cafeteria and waited in there until all employees came in on break, ambushed and subdued them without firing a shot or raising an alarm. They then loaded the money bags with over $18 million into a U Haul, destroyed the CCTV tapes and returned to the party. Then they sat on the money for six months before hiring a crooked lawyer to set up a real estate money laundering scheme to avoid suspicion.

After being arrested, he cracked under interrogation, confessed to the robbery and ratted out his partners. All the men have since finished their prison sentences. And most of the money was never found. So there's a chance they still won in the end.

And under occupation, some even participated in sending people to camps. However, after the war, history was often rewritten to glorify the resistance, which was actually made up of a small group of individuals opposing Nazi occupation. 3, the business plot. Yes, a group of powerful Wall Street figures tried to raise an army of 500,000 men to seize the White House, overthrow FDR, and install a fascist government. And yes, Congress investigated it under seal and concluded that the plot was real, but never named the conspirators. It's somewhat similar to what happened with Epstein. 4. There were more countries in the axis powers than just Germany, Italy and Japan. 5, Expansionist Japan and the atrocities they committed during the 1930s are completely skipped over in most school curriculum, even though it was less than 100 years ago. I've always found that baffling.

One war. Two. Living in Japan as a foreigner. There's a certain subset of people that really romanticize Japan and Japanese culture as highly advanced technologically and socially. It's not that Japan is actually particularly a bad place to live, but they still utilize antiquated technology, have dated social mores and brutal work life balance, and are quite xenophobic and openly turn away foreigners from many services, even medical care. It's not some anime Utopia where everything is perfect. It's quite a challenging place to live for foreigners. It seems Japan welcomes the visitor, but does not always welcome the immigrant. 3. Birthing and raising a baby. People will acknowledge that it's not easy, sure, but it's so much harder than imagined, especially if you don't have a good support system. 4. Not moving on from a partner like I still love you after years of not being together. That's super sad and unhealthy actually. Frown. 5. Farming.

Manatees may also be the inspiration for myths about mermaids, beautiful half fish women that lured sailors to their deaths.

One, a nurse once shared that an old man confessed to sabotaging his brother's parachute during World War 2 because they were in love with the same woman. His brother died and the woman married someone else. Anyway, he said he lived with the guilt every single day. 2. I had an elderly patient in his 80s who shared something devastating with me during transport to the emergency department. He told me that as his wife was dying, she confessed to having multiple affairs throughout their nearly 60 year marriage. She went so far as to tell him she had never loved him and that his only son wasn't biologically his. This man, who likely had only months left to live himself, felt compelled to share this burden with me during what was probably one of his final trips to the hospital. That conversation has stayed with me. I think about it often. 3. I wouldn't call this a confession exactly, but it happened just before a patient died. I was volunteering at a hospice caring for a man with severe dementia. In his final hours, he began reliving memories from his time as a Vietnam draftie. He mistook me and another volunteer for his old war buddies and started recounting what seemed to be a murder he'd been involved in after returning from service. According to his account, they had intended to kill only one man, but the situation escalated. And they ended up killing the man's entire family, his wife and her parents as well. What struck me most was his eerily calm demeanor as he described it. He wasn't distressed or panicked, just methodical and calculating. He was completely unreachable, lost in that memory. Despite our attempts to redirect him, he was in the middle of detailing how they plan to dispose of the bodies when he suddenly snapped back to the present and refused to speak to anyone for the rest of the day. He passed away that same evening just before dinner.

So I bought this cute new sports bra from target last week. Nothing fancy, just black with some pink stripes. I was excited to wear it to the gym because my old one was falling apart and I felt good about myself for once. I walked into my usual gym around six PM when it's always packed with college kids and people getting off work. The second I stepped inside, something felt weird, like really weird. Everyone just stopped what they were doing. The guy doing bench press literally let the bar rest on his chest and stared. The girl on the treadmill almost tripped because she turned her head so fast. Even the front desk worker stopped scanning membership cards. I thought maybe I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe or something embarrassing like that. Checked my reflection in the mirror wall and everything looked normal. Sports bra, leggings, sneakers, hair in a messy bun, same as always. But people kept staring and whispering to each other. I tried to ignore it and went to grab a yoga mat from the rack. That's when I heard this girl behind me whisper to her friend, oh my god, does she not know? Her friend shushed her really loud and they both walked away quickly when they saw me looking. Now I was getting paranoid. I went to the bathroom to check myself again. Maybe I had a huge stain or my bra was see through under the gym lights. But nope, everything looked fine. Sports bra was actually really cute and supportive. I felt confident in it. When I came back out, more people were staring. This older woman on the elliptical kept looking at me and shaking her head with this disgusted expression. A group of guys by the weight rack were pointing and laughing. I was starting to feel sick to my stomach. I decided to just start my workout and ignore everyone. I got on a treadmill and started jogging. The girl next to me kept glancing over every few seconds. Finally, she leaned over and said, hey, I don't wanna be rude, but do you know what that symbol means? I had no idea what she was talking about. What symbol? I asked. Pulling out my earbuds, she pointed at my chest area. On your sports bra, that's not just a design. I looked down at the pink stripes I thought were cute. But now that she mentioned it, they weren't just random stripes. They formed a shape I hadn't noticed before. My stomach dropped when I realized what it was. The pink stripes made a perfect swastika right across my chest. I felt my face turn bright red. Oh, my god. I had no idea. I just thought it was a geometric pattern. I was mortified. No wonder everyone was staring at me like I was some kind of Monster. The girl nodded sympathetically. Yeah, I figured you didn't know. You seem way too nice to be wearing that on purpose. But like everyone in here thinks you're making some kind of statement. I immediately stopped the treadmill and grabbed my towel to cover my chest. I practically ran to the locker room, feeling everyone's eyes on me. A few people were taking pictures with their phones. I wanted to disappear into the floor in the locker room. I called my roommate, Emma, freaking out. She drove over in like 10 minutes with one of her overs.

One. The first piece of jewelry I bought my wife was a necklace. We went on holiday and she lost it. I said I would replace it, but it wasn't the same. She was upset that she'd lost it for sentimental reasons. I emailed the hotel, and of course, they hadn't found it. So I bought a replacement and told my wife they found it. 2. Not me, but my parents. If my mom wants to hide literally anything from my dad, no matter what it is, she just puts it somewhere where he would have to bend over to see it. Doesn't matter if it's something like a package of ore. If my dad has to bend over to find it, he's never going to find it. I've tested it with my own snacks when I was still living with them to confirm it works. He'd be mad if he knew how many snacks we'd hidden from him simply because he doesn't bend over low enough to see it in the cabinet. 3. I wanted my husband to quit wearing denim shorts because they made him look old. He had gained a bit of weight, so I kept buying his shorts in his old size 34. And I bought khaki shorts in a 38. He will never read a label for any reason. He would put on the jorts and then lay on the bed and lift And spread his legs to stretch out the shorts a bit. He blew out the back seam of two pairs in the same day, then ended up putting on the khaki shorts. Since then, almost 20 years, he has insisted that khaki shorts are made better and fit more comfortably than denim shorts of the same size. Four the remote didn't disappear. I accidentally put it through the washing machine and destroyed it and threw it out in a panic. 5. I only put spiders outside when she sees them. If they're only noticed by me, I let them continue hunting bugs, sometimes with a few soft words of encouragement. You're doing a great job, little guy.

Got a framed letter from corporate jokingly congratulating me for having the shortest tenured employee in company history. 2. I manage a small weld shop. Generally I don't care about less than clean background checks or pot as long as you come into work every day and get shit done. Finding reliable welders is difficult, so a lot of shit flies. This sometimes leads to weird employees. This one guy we hired stopped showing up after like three days. Days? He walks in the door, he's bright red from being sunburnt to shit, and his clothes are torn to shreds. Dude was drinking on a little aluminum boat and somehow got lost at sea. He looked like Tom Hanks from castaway. He didn't have cell phone reception so he wasn't able to call me. He did take a bunch of pictures over the few days he was lost at sea though, including one where he was being rescued by the Coast Guard. I gave him the rest of the week off. Coast Guard took him to the hospital, he checked himself out and immediately came into work. Didn't even go home and shower. Odd. Dude three. Watched a cashier ring up his friend and pretty much give him everything. For free. Nobody likes the store, but don't make it so obvious. 4 I once fired a guy and he tried to go back to work. His crush was in the clock in room. When I had to tell him to leave again, he cried on my shoulder as I walked him out of the building. Not because I fired him, but because I told him to leave in front of his crush.

Every time I wear sunglasses somewhere and it's cold outside, some cashier or receptionist trying to make small talk will make a comment to me about oh, look at you wishing for warmer weather. Or remind me that there's snow on the ground. Or ask me why I'm wearing sunglasses when it's so cold outside. It's sunny, guys. They're not called hot weather glasses. 5. How computers actually work. I build them, I fix them, I know what's wrong with them, but when it comes down to it, it's voodoo magic. Six. Humans have walked on the moon. There is a rover sending us pictures of Mars. The Hubble Space Telescope shows us things no human has ever seen before. Meanwhile, here on earth, we can't seem to do anything about those shopping carts with that one wobbly fucked up wheel. Seven. Those images on Facebook that say if you share them you'll get loads Of money? Do people really believe it? How, in what world, in what circumstances, could that ever work? Is it some kind of joke that I'm not in on? Type? Amen.

I'm meeting my boyfriend's twin this summer and I must say I'm kind of nervous that they'll see the look in my eye that says, I wonder if your cocks are the same. I wanna find out. 2. I was in a relationship with a twin for several years. The sex was amazing. We had many good times. Best brother I could have ever asked for. 3, when I was younger, I fell in love with a twin. She was amazing but was dating someone at the time. Her sister ended up liking me a lot, so I figured it was the next best thing. Turns out it wasn't. And it only made not being with the one that I wanted to that much harder. We ended up breaking up and they moved somewhat away. One day I get a knock at my door. It was the one I always wanted to be with looking me up because she always knew and felt the same. Nothing really came of it in the end, just like telling people that I banged twins. 4, while my girlfriend's twin sister looks identical, she has a very different personality. I like the twin who is a Star Wars fan. 5, I dated an identical twin and saw her sister naked before her. The sister, who I had only met once at this point, busted in on us drunk as hell. And A little coped out. The sister's boyfriend was passed out in the room next door and she was completely nude, flipping her shit about god knows what. I had just started dating this girl and this was the first time I was staying over in her bed. My girlfriend was horrified and quickly ushered her sister out the door and locked it behind her. I just awkwardly laughed. She broke down crying. I said, hey, that was weird, but it's okay. Don't worry. Thinking she was embarrassed by her sister's behavior, she said, no, it's not that. I just didn't want you to know what I looked like naked yet coming out of shock, I was like, oh, that's right.

According to the CIA, when training to be a spy, you have to unlearn how to lean. Americans tend to lean on things when standing still. Two, walked into a bar in Australia, ordered a beer, and then the bartender noticed I'm American. I asked, was it the accent or my choice of Budweiser beer? He said, because you are the fattest fuck I have ever seen in my life, mate. Three, having a private conversation that everyone within 20 meters can hear. Four, British man once told me he knew I was American because I was wearing a baseball cap backwards. 5, saying the word y'all. Six, when I lived in Europe, people said only Americans eat while walking. I'll be eating a bagel or something on the way to work or class and multiple people asked if I was American. 7. You ask where they are from and they start giving you percentages. 8, while visiting Turkey, I was told that I looked American because I was sitting with one leg across the other and the bottom of my shoe was exposed. Apparently it's rude. I don't know. 9. I don't know how true it is, but when I was in a hostel in Japan, we met a guy from France, I think. But anywho, at some point he mentioned he could tell we were from USA. He said it was because we talked loudly, like our normal speaking volume was Louder. And now I can't help but notice that sometimes when I speak to someone from a foreign country, I do feel like I talk louder than them.

What's the most embarrassing situation where you've been mistaken for your twin? One, my twin brother recommended a restaurant to me, said that he and his wife went there all the time. Good food, really friendly staff. So I took my wife there. Food was as advertised, but the service somewhere between cold and openly hostile, like they resented our presence. I was puzzled by the contrast between what I'd heard and what I saw. Suddenly from the front of the restaurant, explosion of laughter, much rapid talking. Suddenly the waitress is there smiling and all, just as my brother and his wife walk around the corner. They thought my brother was cheating on his wife with some blonde. Yeah, it's funny now. 2, I was dating a girl in college. The first time I went to her house, she opened the door. I told her I liked what she did to her hair and kissed her. She kissed me. We went inside. She then yells, your boyfriend is here. They were weird girls. 3. Not a twin, just Asian. Constantly asked at work about projects I am not involved in. Realize co workers think I am the other Asian guy. 4. Not me, but a co worker has two sets of twin daughters. The younger pair are identical and both work at the same McDonald's. The manager often puts one on the pay window and the other on the food window just to mess with Customers. 5, I've been called my twin sister's name my whole life. So one day I accidentally introduced myself to someone as her. When I caught and corrected myself they thought I was straight up crazy for not knowing my own name. 6, a friend and his wife go to the same supermarket every week. His identical twin also goes there with his wife. One day after summoning up the courage, the cashier pulls my friend's wife aside and says, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but I've seen your husband here several times with another woman. 7, my friend said hi to his brother one morning. Well, it turns out his brother was actually his own reflection in a window. His mom witnessed it and has never let him live it down. 8, my twin had recently committed suicide and I was at a bar drinking away my rage and a friend of his came up and flipped out on me saying how awful of a joke it was and took everything I had not to remove their teeth with my fist.

Honestly, I got rejected by a girl who seemed to send very obvious signs, so I don't know anything anymore. 2. I've heard you can tell by where they put their feet, like if they put their feet behind their ears, they really like you. 3, a girl flirted with me in French, stole my bag under the table as a joke, wanted to arm wrestle and sat in the pub with me for 7 hours. She could have been Canadian, so I never knew if she liked me or not. Second date is today. 4, I tell my wife about a weird interaction I had with a waitress lady at the store, etc. Then she tells me that woman was hitting on me. Apparently I'm oblivious. 5. Looking back on my time in college, I got some pretty clear signs that I completely missed. If a girl invites you back to her dorm because she forgot something and then can't remember what she was going back to get and then sits on her bed and just kind of looks at you, that's a pretty clear sign. I think about that occasionally. I can't believe I missed that. 1. 6, laughing at everything I say. It's how I recognized my girlfriend. Like me, I could say virtually anything and I could see her laughing. 7, if you see that person hiding in a tree outside your window. 8. I Like things to be very clear and obvious. So I insist on waiting for them to issue me a Section 3.02 notice intention to pursue romantically, which will set out their detailed five year plan for us and describe the boundaries of their proposed pursuit, including likes, dislikes and information on any allergies. Still waiting, but one day I'm sure my luck will turn.

I woke up, watched Buffy, ate pizza, called my brother, went to work, came home and watched the end of the series of Buffy. It may sound like a joke, but I got up after finishing Buffy the Vampire Slayer and went walking. I kept listening to Gangsters Paradise on my iPod until I reached the Aurora Bridge. I live in Seattle. If you know the bridge, you may know that in the last couple years, they have built very high fences around it. But when I was there, there was just a small handrail. I walked to the middle of the bridge and looked down for a while. This part of the bridge was overland and not water, so I continued to walk until I wasn't above someone's yard. I was probably 100 yards before the end of the bridge. I stood looking over the railing for 10 minutes, maybe more. A man got off the 16 bus at the stop right before the bridge and walked toward me. He stopped beside me and asked if I was okay, and I didn't reply for a while. He just stood next to me for a while and just kept talking. He never stopped talking. He talked about the bridge and the bus and his family and about his work and chattered away for a solid 10 minutes. He asked where I lived and I told him Put his hand on my back and coerced me off the bridge and onto a bus. He bust me home and walked me to my front door. I never got his name and I haven't seen him since. But he saved my life. I don't know that I would ever have killed myself, but that's the closest I ever came to it. A stranger saved me and I really hope he knows that. 2. I treated it like a normal day. I got up, went to school, came home and went for it. I tried to enjoy the last moments I had with friends. I wanted to tell somebody but decided not to. I didn't want to bring anyone down. The day before, I wrote letters to those closest to me. On my last day, I left them on the kitchen counter, headed up to the roof and just stared down. It was around nine PM so when I glanced down, I saw nothing. It was pitch black. My right foot hovered around the edge. Right when I was about to leap off, I looked up cross the street. I saw a few people staring at me from their apartment window. This little girl, though, her gaze caught my eye. She shook her head then covered her face. Because of her, I didn't go through with it. 3, my younger brother texted me early that morning in a really good mood saying what a great day it was going to Be then he apparently went around giving out his stuff, buying people lunch and telling his close friends his bank info, etc. He wanted to make sure his friends were covered. I was at work so I didn't get the I love you Dragon flexo text until after he was in the hospital. The sad thing was when I read that text, I knew something was wrong. 4 my friend put on his Facebook the day before he did it, if you had one day to live, what would you do? The day he did it, he went around to all of his close friend and just spent a little time with them, like a half hour, just hang out and shoot shit as usual. Later that night, he texted everyone goodbye. He drove down to one of our favorite smoke spots and obviously no one knows after that except him. But that's where two of my friend found him the next day.

One, I didn't find this loophole, but my friend did. A few years back, an online store had this promotion where whoever spent the most money over a month would get free round trip airplane tickets to anywhere in the world. My friend who's a fucking genius found that one thing you could buy on the site was a gift certificate. So he bought a 25 dollar gift certificate and kept spending it on another 25 dollar gift certificate. So he ended up spending 25 dollars on round trip tickets to Australia. 2. My brother once yelled last one to jump in the pool is gay and then jumped into the pool. However, I figured out that if I did not jump in, then technically he would be the last one in the pool and he is still gay to this day. 3. I used to work at papa John's to pay my way through college. There was a contest we had where if you got someone to upsize their pizza from like a medium to a large for an extra $2, you got points towards movie tickets. A large was simply $2 extra normally anyways, anyone that ordered a large, I simply put in a medium and up sized it. I won every fucking week my co workers didn't notice this obvious loophole and it didn't cost the customer extra. So I didn't have a problem with this morally gray Area, free movie tickets every week was a huge in college. Four, there was a drink machine in college that was 75 cents for a juice. If you put a dollar in, it gave you five quarters in change. I got a juice every day for months before they finally fixed it. 5. When I wear glasses, white people aren't afraid of me. I can blend in anywhere. Nobody wants to be the guy who asks if the black guy really works there. I can walk straight in. Area 51, edit. I'm in the hospital. They shot me in the leg and said I was trespassing. Thanks whoever told me to bring that clipboard. It deflected a bullet. Probably saved my life, honestly. 6, that you can jiggle the handle of certain gumball machines to get free gumballs. 7. For a while, McDonald's had a promo where when you walked in, you could scan a QR code and possibly get free food. However, different locations and different cutouts had different codes. I took pics of as many unique codes I could find, put them all on a handy PDF and scanned them all using an Android device and an Los device. Before lunch, I got free extra value meals regularly. In fact, I still had a couple free ones left over when they stopped the promotion.

One. I had a friend I was crushing on, and I thought he liked me, too. One day we were chatting online and he had to leave for work. Before logging off, he said, I'll be back later to spend more time with my favorite Asian. Confused, I asked, who's that? For as long as I knew him, he thought I was Asian. Once he found out I wasn't, he ghosted me. Two. I was at a dinner party and people kept offering me drinks that I continued to decline. Eventually, one woman's eyes lit up as she looked between me and my husband, and then she asked, oh my gosh, are you pregnant? Everyone around us got quiet, and I laughed and said, no, I have epilepsy. I was handed no more glasses of wine after that. 3. My ex wife was convinced I had another family in another state simply because she heard a kid's voice in the background when I was traveling for work and sitting in a restaurant. Once during divorce depositions, I spent a full day being questioned, and half the questions were slightly different wordings of so you have another family, kid, etcetera. 4. One time in Japan, I asked an old lady for directions in Japanese. I was still a beginner, but I tried my best to speak in their language rather than asking stuff in English. So this lady Assumed I spoke very good Japanese and started chatting. I tried telling her I couldn't understand and everyone else on the bus was trying to hide their laughter. The conversation went on for 10 minutes and I still have no idea what she was saying. She was very nice though. 5 I live in a very Hispanic slash Latino area and one woman heard me speak English and yelled at me for not speaking Spanish, calling me a traitor to my ancestors and bringing shame to my past family history in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Imagine her surprise when I told her I was Arab and Middle Eastern. Still felt guilty for not knowing Spanish for some reason lol. 6 people assumed as high school I was eating nothing but junk because I was rapidly gaining weight while my twin wasn't. In truth I was starving myself because I couldn't figure out why I was gaining weight. It wasn't until my 20s I found out I had a tumor on my thyroid and that's what caused the weight gain.

When she said what kind of bird is a ham? Was hard to ignore. 2. When he ran out of gas while in line at the Starbucks drive through right across the street from the gas station. I told him to get gas first because his car was low, but he really needed that iced caramel macchiato. I asked why he didn't listen to me and he replied with I thought I could make it. He ended up pushing the car through the drive through and got his coffee while doing so, then parked the car in the lot and called a tow to tow it back home instead of the gas station across the street. No, he did not get any gas that day. He waited until his dad got off work to bring a three gallon jug of gasoline because I refused to enable that shit. 3. How do oil companies know where to build gas stations? She thought that there was a gasoline bubble underground that they would tap into and run a line straight to the pump. She was working for Chevron. 4. She thought that Islands Float. 5. When he asked my grandmother if she'd ever had children. 6. I was having bad cramps and I took an Advil. My ex told me I shouldn't take them because it's a gazebo. 7. She seemed to be confused about the difference between flamingos and penguins, but Insisted they weren't real because she'd grown up in Alaska and never seen any. 8 he played a lot of cod and got a tattoo based on a cool design he saw in the game. It was the Nazi eagle. Nine I told him I had to leave in one and a half hours. He told me that was oddly specific and I should have rounded up to two hours instead of one hour and 50 minutes. I clarified that I had to leave in one hour and 30 minutes, and he said, that's actually 1.3 hours. 10 her look at the moon. That ain't right. Me what do you mean, her? You're not supposed to see the moon during the daytime. The government put that there to spy on us. Me what? 11 I was going into anaphylactic shock at a restaurant due to unknown allergy. My throat was closing and I had no neck due to swelling. He asked if I wanted to go outside to get some air. We were sitting on the patio. 12 he insisted that Spain was in South America because they spoke Spanish.

One A recruit fired all his blank ammo during ambush response training. He crawled in ditch to opposite where the aggressors were and started throwing rocks at them. Dye came running in middle of the road blowing his whistle and screaming what the fuck are you doing? Recruit screamed back throwing hand grenades. Drill sergeant without missing a beat, the DI screamed outstanding! And walked away. Two asked a private the difference between cover and concealment. Private said drill sergeant, you asked what seems like a very important question which I am supposed to know the answer. However, this private was imagining not being called on and was not paying attention to the question. Drill Sergeant 3 I ordered the platoon to form up facing west. One troop asked Master Corporal, our west or your west? I just walked away angrily and let his peers sort him out. I came out of my office and they were facing east. Four required to have creases in your uniform, and if you know anything about it, you can sometimes fuck it up and give a shirt. Two creases commonly referred to as railroad tracks. On morning information for uniform inspection it was discovered someone had done this to their shirt, so in come the disc. At one point one of them yelling, asked Recruit X, are you a train conductor? And sure as shit he was before he joined. So He answered, sir, yes, sir. Everyone got awkward quiet for what felt like five minutes, but I'm sure it was only five seconds. And then the group of them went on yelling at the next person in Formation. 5 I heard a recruit say this. D S, did your mother send you here to piss me off? You write home and tell her you're doing a good job. Recruit sir, no, sir. My father sent me here to piss my mother off. DS spun on his heel and marched off with his head down and his hand over mouth. 6 I feel bad for the guy, but I gotta say it. His last name was smelly, as in smelly. So when I had him come into the class for the Orientations Admin Day, the very first day, I asked everyone to stand up and give their rank, name, serial number. So when I heard Private Smelly, I lost it. I felt so bad for the guy.

That the reason old people move so slowly is that they are in pain. 2. Balloon fish inhale water to expand, not air. Gonna blame Nemo for that. 3. I didn't realize how much I interrupted people while they were talking until one person didn't let me. They bulldozed right over whatever the fuck I had to add. I'm much more aware now. 4A Fortnite is called that because it's 14 nights. Five. I legitimately thought you grew pickles, like, underwater. I'm not a smart man. 6. I thought when people said you can't stare at the sun it was because it was a really hard thing to do. Like a skill rather than the truth, which is it damages your eyes horribly. So I'd boast at how I could stare for up to three minutes before I had to look away. Glad I didn't take you can't breathe underwater literally. 2 7. I had to explain to my mother, sister, and boyfriend that cobwebs are leftover spider webs that collected dust, not just dust magically stringing together. 8. I thought it was normal to get a little burning sensation in your throat when you eat hazelnuts. Turns out I was allergic. Nine. Horses scratch themselves behind their ears just like a dog does. Like, with their hind legs. 10. The bald spot on the back of my head. I mean, I knew it was there for a few years. But last month, we moved into a new house, and the upstairs bathroom has a large wall mirror across from the vanity mirror. So now every morning while I brush my teeth, all I can do is stare at my bald spot. All this time, I've been walking around like this, unaware of just how large and obvious it was. 11 I was told a couple weeks ago that hay was just dried grass. I thought it was its own thing that grew, and I just never saw it.

It may sound like a joke, but I got up after finishing Buffy the Vampire Slayer and went walking. I kept listening to Gangsters Paradise on my iPod until I reached the Aurora Bridge. I live in Seattle. If you know the bridge, you may know that in the last couple years, they have built very high fences around it. But when I was there, there was just a small handrail. I walked to the middle of the bridge and looked down for a while. This part of the bridge was overland and not water, so I continued to walk until I wasn't above someone's yard. I was probably 100 yards before the end of the bridge. I stood looking over the railing for 10 minutes, maybe more. A man got off the 16 bus at the stop right before the bridge and walked toward me. He stopped beside me and asked if I was okay, and I didn't reply for a while. He just stood next to me for a while and just kept talking. He never stopped talking. He talked about the bridge and the bus and his family and about his work and chattered away for a solid 10 minutes. He asked where I lived, and I told him. He Put his hand on my back and coerced me off the bridge and onto a bus. He bust me home and walked me to my front door. I never got his name, and I haven't seen him since. But he saved my life. I don't know that I would ever have killed myself, but that's the closest I ever came to it. A stranger saved me, and I really hope he knows that. 2. I treated it like a normal day. I got up, went to school, came home and went for it. I tried to enjoy the last moments I had with friends. I wanted to tell somebody, but decided not to. I didn't want to bring anyone down. The day before, I wrote letters to those closest to me. On my last day, I left them on the kitchen counter, headed up to the roof, and just stared down. It was around nine PM, so when I glanced down, I saw nothing. It was pitch black. My right foot hovered around the edge. Right when I was about to leap off, I looked up across the street. I saw a few people staring at me from their apartment window. This little girl, though her gaze caught my eye. She shook her head, then covered her face. Because of her, I didn't go through with it. 3. My younger brother texted me early that morning in a really good mood, saying what a great day it was going to Be then. He apparently went around giving out his stuff, buying people lunch, and telling his close friends his bank info, etc. He wanted to make sure his friends were covered. I was at work so I didn't get the I love you Dragon flexo text until after he was in the hospital. The sad thing was when I read that text I knew something was wrong. 4 my friend put on his Facebook the day before he did it if you had one day to live, what would you do? The day he did it he went around to all of his close friend and just spent a little time with them. Like a half hour. Just hang out and shoot shit as usual. Later that night he texted everyone goodbye. He drove down to one of our favorite smoke spots and obviously no one knows after that except him, but that's where two of my friend found him the next day.

One, recently I've been working out more. My wife says the veins popping out of my arms and hands get her all hot and bothered for some reason. Either way, it feels good when she touches them. Two, husky voices on girls. If she sounds like a dude, that's just insanely hot. No idea why. 3, when my girl scolds me in her native tongue, I can't understand a word, but god, it sounds sexy. 4. Don't know why, but exhausted men look super hot to me. Probably because being exhausted is as close as being the real you as possible. 5, people who can ramble on about their passion for hours. I love listening to people talk about the stuff they love. 6, men's calves. Snuggling up to those bad boys can be a real turn on. 7, when a girl's hair falls over her face, it just looks super pretty to me, especially if she doesn't push it out of the way immediately. 8, when someone you're talking to sticks out their tongue. Had a girl slightly do it on a date and it drove me wild. 9. Some women wear bags under their eyes very well. 10, canine teeth all day. 11, the neck when a woman has her hair up and those little bits of hair curl around. 12. I like scars. Each one has a story and I wanna know it. 13. I like scars each One has a story and I wanna know it. 14, when people share their too much information moments, there's something weirdly sexy when someone drops their guard for a moment and gives you a peek behind the curtain of their life. 15. This is pretty specific, my boyfriend recently shaved his beard off and just left a mustache. Holy heck. I was not expecting to dig the sexy Flanders vibe he's got going on. 16, poofy hair.

I think this is the female equivalent of a man rolling up the long sleeves on his shirt. 2. Say your name when they say good night. If it's over, text. 3, whenever my girlfriend tries to get my attention, she tugs at my shirt sleeve and says, boyfriend, boyfriend. I guess it sounds weird, but I think it's the cutest thing in the world. 4, I love it when a girl stretches. Just a yawn and a stretch in the morning does it. Five, cute little sneezes, snoring and sounds they make. Sometimes even breathing can seem cute. 6. One girl that I know scrunches her nose to fix her glasses. It's adorable. 7, mild frustration from a joke. I know oddly specific, but I swear they try not to laugh, but they can't help it. So they just have a tiny fit and it's cute to me. 8, wink at me with both of their eyes. 9, that little wiggle when they are putting on tight pants. 10. I like when they are thinking at work and put their hair over their top lip like a mustache. 11, that little dance they do when they show off a dress with pockets. 12, the way most of them giggle. IDK what it is, but when you hear a woman genuinely giggle, It's warming on the inside. 13, my girlfriend does this thing where she'll say something really adorable in bed that makes her feel really awkward afterwards, so she says it, then hides under the blanket afterwards. I love it. 14, it ranges from cute to attractive, but a compliment for something you think you suck at. 15, the girl I'm talking to right now hides her face in her jacket whenever something is super cringey. I think it's adorable. 16, put her head on my shoulder when we're just sitting.

I'm not attractive, but a girl did scream, hey, you're cute at me while I was pumping gas the other night. I'm sure she was drunk, but I'll be riding that ego boost for at least the next three months. 2, my dad started pointing out how many girls were checking me out whenever we were in public. I was always oblivious to it, mostly because I was in a long term relationship and never really cared. Initially I laughed at the notion, but a few of my girlfriends have started to point out the same. 3, when I was told I was the highest quality meat at the gym by an absolute babe, I felt so objectified. It was great. Four, in high school, my friends and I stumbled across a rally for 9 11 truthers and started to argue with them. At one point, one of the truthers got fed up and told us to go away and get a life. He turned to me and said, you're a good looking guy. Why don't you go get a girlfriend? It's rare to get that kind of compliment from someone who's pissed at you. 5, when I heard my little son 6, tell his friend, no, I do not look like my mommy, I look like my dad. We are both handsome. 6, when a few of my female friends told me, I used to have such a crush on you. In high school, in fact, a lot of girls did. I never knew about it so I never made any passes at them and went through high school thinking I looked like a potato. 7. I've had to put less and less effort into conversations over the years. 8, a really cute girl in my site class put her hand on my shoulder in a conversation once, gave it a squeeze and then glanced at my shoulder. She made this little oo sound here, eyes kind of glazed and she started just kind of holding her hand there, lightly squeezing. I was pretty uncomfortable about it at this point and asked if she was okay. She just sort of smiled and said, yeah, much better, thanks. Pats my shoulder and turns away. I asked another girl what that was about and she just said, really? Girls like hot guys. 9, when I was a kid, I never thought of myself as attractive. The boys at school and the girls made it very clear that I was a buck tooth freak. We went on holiday to Cape Town, December 1998. I was 13 then. And we were in a restaurant one day after a few days of sun and swimming and I went to the bathroom. As I was washing my hands, I looked up into the mirror and suddenly my face looked different. Guess the tan paid off well against sun bleached blonde hair. I just stared at myself and wondered if It really was me. I didn't recognize myself, shrugged it off and went back to my family. But I then started noticing that grown ass men were staring at me. It freaked me out. Boys started wanting to hang out with me on the beach. It freaked me out. I was never hot and I never wanted to be. But that was the day I realized that I wasn't a total troll.

When I ordered a small drink, it was actually small. 2. The only thing that really surprised me was how much pedestrians trusted cars to not hit them. 3. The age of all the buildings. Walked into a pub in the UK with a plaque that reads something like, this building was constructed in the year 2 and was used by monks to fend off dinosaurs. Maybe not the exact words, but you get it. 4. I went to Scotland, ran across some German tourists who asked us to translate what the Scott was saying. We were all three speaking English. They just couldn't understand each other. 5. You hear about how big the Roman Empire was and all the advanced building tech they had, but it doesn't really sink in until you see it with your own eyes. 6. In France, people get two hour lunches. Like some stores will have two separate open and close times cause they'll just shut down for two hours a day to enjoy themselves. Most people seemed much happier and relaxed as a whole. 7. That tax was included on the price tag. 8. I'm Dutch, but I'll never forget my American girlfriend's reaction to seeing rows and rows of parked bicycles in front of the train station when she came to visit the Netherlands. Oh my god, look at all those bikes. 9 in Italy, the shower at one of My hotels had no barriers to keep the water in one general area. It was just a drain in the floor. Luckily, it was just that one, and it was definitely an older hotel. 10, the amount of public transportation, and in many places, people not driving or not even knowing how to drive. Even young children were using public transportation, not escorted by adults to get to school. Eleven, I heard a story of a lady who was dumbfounded that there weren't going to be fireworks celebrating the 4th of July. Couldn't conceive the idea that other countries don't celebrate America's Independence Day. 12, I was in Switzerland for a few days. I felt like the fattest person in the country at 6 feet, 210 pounds. 13. Personal bubble is very different. It shocks you at first and you feel sort of claustrophobic, but then you get used to it. Two, it's kind of subtle until you come back to the States and unconsciously stand so close to someone else in a line that they start shooting you dirty looks.

One, in high school, I woke up on a day where very icy weather was expected and couldn't find school closings on TV. I begrudgingly got ready for school, stepped out my front door and immediately slipped on ice, landing flat on my back. Got up, shook it off and cursed the school for not being closed. I had to crawl my way up a hill to the bus stop because I kept slipping down ice on the way there. Got to the bus stop and waited over half an hour for it to get there. Check my watch repeatedly, getting more and more angry each time. Finally decide that they must have canceled school and slowly make it back home where I see a clock. It was now 2:00am. 2. I once was cooking Mac and cheese and started squeezing the cheese sauce in before draining the water. When I realized the mistake, I grabbed the cheese sauce with my hands and it just made everything worse in every way. 3, birthday is March 12th. In high school, I saw that my birthday was going to fall on a Thursday, so I was like, oh wow, Thursday the 12th. I proceeded to scan the next couple of decades on my iPod touch calendar to find out if my birthday would ever fall on Friday the 13th. 4. I recently went to pick up an order of glasses. The optician asked me To try them on to see if they fit well. I told him this must be someone else's order because everything was blurry. He was surprised and started hunting through boxes and I kept squinting and looking around at blurry shapes. We did this for 10 minutes before the optometrist walked in. He explained the issue and the optometrist paused and asked where I put the glasses I was wearing when I walked in. I said I was wearing contacts. I was wearing contacts and I put the new glasses over my contacts. I asked the optometrist if this gave me double the perfect vision and she replied, if you mean double vision, sure. 5. During the holidays, I walked through an arts and crafts store trying to find something very specific. After finding out they didn't have it, I got in a long line to check out. It didn't hit me that I didn't have anything to buy until it was my turn. I just walked past the cashier, waved and said, have a nice day. It was night f my life. 6, wondering if lime was real word or if I made it up.

Just for context, I'm Polish. I truly believe that Americans have this weird thing about believing in themselves. For example, I don't believe I will become the person I wanna be. I don't believe I will achieve anything in my life. I don't believe I will be happy in my life. Then I watch people from America who believe they can do anything and they just go for it. Does it always work? No, but it gives them a way higher chance than mine when I don't believe. Two, 21 years ago, the United States was able to deploy forces halfway across the world, roll into Baghdad and conquer Iraq in less than one month with only a few hundred American deaths. By contrast, Russia still hasn't even gotten to Kiev after three years of fighting, despite Ukraine being Russia's neighbor. And Russia has suffered 750,000 dead and wounded in the process. 3. Enthusiasm. I live in Ireland and we're all miserable pricks, as are most Europeans. But when we meet Americans, we're always amazed at the enthusiasm and energy they have for even the most mundane stuff. I once saw a bunch of American tourists shout, oh, freaking hell yeah, let's go, and high five each other because they managed to fit all their luggage and groceries into the car. If that was me and my buds, we'd be like, ah, nice. Four national parks courtesy of Theodore Roosevelt. 5. I could be wrong, but I'm in Australia and I love the way Americans go all out for holidays, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas. It all looks so fun.

One starlight from the boys. At first I thought it was CGI and part of her character, but then I realized she's had horrible surgery. She looks so much better in the earlier seasons, but now she looks drastically different, almost unrecognizable. 2. Simon Cowell I feel like Simon Cowell from 20 years ago would ridicule and lambaste current Simon worse than he ever did with any crazy X Factor or American Idol contestant. His excessive plastic surgery has altered his appearance significantly. 3. The Kardashian Jenner clan they immediately come to mind. A lot of younger celebrities seem to be following the trend of overusing fillers and Botox. Combined with buckle fat removal, it's aging them horribly, making them look middle aged well before they turn 34. Lindsay Lohan. I know she's been through a lot, but the plastic surgery hasn't helped. She was one of the first people my age that I saw undergo extensive cosmetic work, and it was sobering to witness the transformation. 5. Ariana Grande she's still really young and started out naturally beautiful, but she's already started looking a bit uncanny. You don't usually see this level of plastic surgery until someone reaches their 40s. It's surprising and a little disheartening.

In his defense, it was consensual and she was devastatingly attractive.

One. Rebel Wilson. She was funny in the beginning, but rode the fat funny friend trope way too far in every movie. It's so sad. Same with Melissa McCarthy. But at least I feel like Melissa can truly act. She's just stuck in the trope. They both tend to play similar fat slob characters repeatedly. Two. Chris Pratt. Hear me out. He did amazing work on TV. Andy from parks and recreation is an amazing character, and he was great in that role, but since becoming a leading man, he's become wooden. It's like he has this idea of what a leading man should be, and that's all he does in every film. Three. Everybody loves Danny Trejo, but he only ever plays Danny Trejo. To be fair, nobody but Danny Trejo could ever play Danny Trejo. 4. You know that movie where Michael Cera plays the awkward teenager? Yeah, that's basically every movie he's in. Five. Might get some hate for this, but Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart in every movie. He's hilarious and works well in the roles he's in, and I have nothing against the guy, but I don't think his acting has much range. 6. Jared Leto, Will Smith's kids, and many others come to mind, but they often get into acting through nepotism. Many of them come from rich families that helped open doors for them in Hollywood.

He started screaming for her to stop hiding, saying that he would only hurt her if she resisted. He was laughing the entire Time acting like he was invincible.

One when my ex and I got into dumb arguments or debates, we'd send it to council for review. There was no council. There would be no review. It was our way of shelving an argument that would never have a winner. Occasionally, we'd ask each other if we heard back from council about the judgment. Two. My husband and I have a game we call business, business. The goal is to clasp the other person's right hand, fully shake it twice, and say business, business. If the other person pulls their hand away or shouts business, business at the same time, it's a failed attempt. There's no score, but the last successful handshake holder is the reigning champion until dethroned. This started as an inside joke, but has spiraled into a full on competition, including notable wins, like at my uncle's funeral while reaching for a water bottle in the middle of the desert, and during heated arguments. Now whenever we try to hold hands, there's always a moment of hesitation to ensure it's not a ploy. 3. When the laundry comes out of the dryer, my partner dumps the warm pile on me, and I sort socks and underwear from inside the heap. Meanwhile, he hangs up shirts and folds pants. We call it Laundry Turtle. 4. He absolutely must touch my butt at least once every time we go to Walmart. I can't even remember how This started, but it feels weird if we forget. 5. We have a dollar Bill that fell between the washer and dryer during laundry one day. Neither of us could be bothered to fish it out, so we left it there for over a year. Eventually we acknowledged it and decided to leave it as a symbol of our wealth. We've added a quarter to it now it's our emergency fund. 6. We wrestle for fun. Not in a sexy or playful let the other one way, but as a legit competition. 7. We often stand in each other's way for no reason other than to be annoying. 8. We have a mating dance that has evolved over the decade we've been together. It includes moves like slapping one's own butt, moving arms like a Choo Choo train, and one handed clapping. Some moves go out of fashion year by year, but our repertoire is significant.

One, Rebel Wilson. She was funny in the beginning but rode the fat funny friend trope way too far in every movie. It's so sad. Same with Melissa McCarthy, but at least I feel like Melissa can truly act. She's just stuck in the trope. They both tend to play similar fat slob characters repeatedly. 2, Chris Pratt, hear me out. He did amazing work on TV. Andy from parks and recreation is an amazing character, and he was great in that role. But since becoming a leading man, he's become wooden. It's like he has this idea of what a leading man should be and that's all he does in every film. 3, everybody loves Danny Trae Ho, but he only ever plays Danny Trae Ho. To be fair, nobody but Danny Trae Ho could ever play Danny Trae Ho. 4, you know that movie where Michael Cera plays the awkward teenager? Yeah, that's basically every movie he's in. 5. Might get some hate for this, but Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart in every movie. He's hilarious and works well in the roles he's in. And I have nothing against the guy, but I don't think his acting has much range. 6, Jared Leto, Will Smith's kids and many others come to mind, but they often get into acting through nepotism. Many of them come from rich families that helped open doors for them in Hollywood.

They can ask really good questions. I'm talking about people who ask really good questions, not just any questions. Really good ones. I don't know how 1 would achieve this skill. 2. When they explain something, they make you feel intelligent. Three. Explaining something complex is simple terms. Knowledge is so vast that they can talk about in the easiest way for someone else to understand. 4. They spend time thinking before asking a question or answering. 1. 5. They're very good at problem solving, even if it's something they have no experience with. They always approach the problem from the right angle. 6. They can genuinely consider an idea which opposes their world view without necessarily accepting it. 7. They can switch up the way they talk to match the person they're talking to without sounding condescending. They listen to how others learn and explain it in that person's language of understanding. 8. They aren't afraid to say they don't know the answer to a question. 9. Understanding or appreciating nuance. 10. They are okay with being perceived as stupid by asking questions. If we hold back in fear we'll never truly learn. Plus it's a good way to show others it's okay to question things if you don't understand. Better off if we're on the same page instead of hoping things work out without being informed.

When you're in an argument and the person you are arguing with thinks they are winning because they keep interrupting you and won't let you talk, drives me up a wall. 2, having pride in not knowing something. 3, using buzz words without knowing what they mean, especially when you ask them to clarify what they are talking about and they continue regurgitating the same buzzwords. 4, thinking that getting a pay raise means you'll make less money because you are in a higher tax bracket. 5, reading a headline and thinking you now know the whole story. 6. I will never understand flat earthers. You can literally see the curvature of earth depending on where you are. 7. Treating people who speak with an accent like they are ignorant or inferior. These people are literally communicating to you in a second language to them. 8. Bragging about not reading. 9, taking social media influencers seriously. 10, not wanting your kids to do better than you. 11, being really loud for no reason. 12, having no basic geography knowledge. 13, defending billionaires, thinking you'll be one someday while working for the man. 14, people who lack critical thinking skills and the ability to work independently.

One, the person you strapped yourself to for a tandem skydive was up until 3:00am doing cookies last night. Two, the best time to buy a car is the second model year of its release. Year one, it's patchwork to just get them off the line. Year two, everything is fixed and has quality content. Year three, plus Oems give incentives to make parts cheaper and to discontent to improve margins. 3. Sometimes when a job is posted and the requirements are unrealistic, that's because they already have someone that needs to be promoted to that specific position and they simply tailor that job ad so only that person qualifies even if hundreds of people apply. 4. Political propaganda. TV hosts and speakers don't believe that shit themselves and are very cynical about it like it's just a job like any other. 5. The signal strength bars on your phone don't mean anything real. Each phone manufacturer comes up with their own secret formula. It might change between software versions and it's just a holdover from the old first generation analog phones. When received signal strength was the only important metric. 4G and 5G networks are way too complex to distill into one bar graph but customers are used to it so phones still have it. 6. Many therapists need therapy themselves, sometimes a lot of it. 7. The massive professional quality cinema projectors that movie theaters. Use the ones that can project crystal clear 4 K+ images. The ones linked to top notch surround systems that make movies come to life. The ones so big they have a giant exhaust hose. They have regular HDMI ports on the side. 8, utility construction, primarily fiber. The majority of the subcontractors have no idea what they're actually doing and are just following the instructions like it's IKEA furniture. 9, your call isn't really important to us.

When I ordered a small drink, it was actually small. 2. The only thing that really surprised me was how much pedestrians trusted cars to not hit them. 3. The age of all the buildings. Walked into a pub in the UK with a plaque that reads something like, this building was constructed in the year 2 and was used by monks to fend off dinosaurs. Maybe not the exact words, but you get it. 4. I went to Scotland, ran across some German tourists who asked us to translate what the Scott was saying. We were all three speaking English. They just couldn't understand each other. 5. You hear about how big the Roman Empire was and all the advanced building tech they had, but it doesn't really sink in until you see it with your own eyes. 6. In France, people get two hour lunches. Like some stores will have two separate open and close times cause they'll just shut down for two hours a day to enjoy themselves. Most people seemed much happier and relaxed as a whole. 7. That tax was included on the price tag. 8. I'm Dutch, but I'll never forget my American girlfriend's reaction to seeing rows and rows of parked bicycles in front of the train station when she came to visit the Netherlands. Oh my god, look at all those bikes. 9 in Italy, the shower at one of My hotels had no barriers to keep the water in one general area. It was just a drain in the floor. Luckily, it was just that one, and it was definitely an older hotel. 10, the amount of public transportation, and in many places, people not driving or not even knowing how to drive. Even young children were using public transportation, not escorted by adults to get to school. Eleven, I heard a story of a lady who was dumbfounded that there weren't going to be fireworks celebrating the 4th of July. Couldn't conceive the idea that other countries don't celebrate America's Independence Day. 12, I was in Switzerland for a few days. I felt like the fattest person in the country at 6 feet, 210 pounds. 13. Personal bubble is very different. It shocks you at first and you feel sort of claustrophobic, but then you get used to it. Two, it's kind of subtle until you come back to the States and unconsciously stand so close to someone else in a line that they start shooting you dirty looks.

In my first apartment, my parents came to visit and I said freak when I hit my head on the open door of the freezer while standing up from grabbing something from the fridge. My mother said, you can't talk like that in my home and stopped mid sentence. I pointed at her and said, yeah, that's right, mom, shut your mouth. 2. I taught my 6th grade students about democratic processes and we ran a simulation without fail. Every one of my classes tried to impeach me. 3, a coworker friend of mine was flying back from a sales conference in Vegas and he was able to upgrade to a first class seat. We had this obnoxious sales VP that was on the same flight. She was the snobby entitled type with a full time nanny and giant Mcmansion in the suburbs and she generally treated people who worked for her like servants. She sees him in a first class seat as she is making her way to coach and asks him how he got that seat. As people are getting settled in, she makes her way back up to the first class cabin and asks to speak with a lead flight attendant. She tells him that one of her underlings is sitting in first class and that she needs to switch with him since she's higher on the corporate ladder. The guy can't Believe what he's hearing, but she won't take no for an answer. Finally, he tells her she has to go back to her seat or she will be escorted from the plane. She made a complete joke of herself in front of the whole first class cabin 4. When I was in high school, I worked at a popular warehouse club selling computers on weekends. I was hired by the store manager through a friend's referral. I loved computers, so my job was to stay in the computer department and sell them, nothing else. One shift manager didn't like that and insisted I needed to go fold clothes for half my shift. I told him the store manager instructed me never to leave the technology department, but he insisted. This went on for several weeks. The store manager showed up one weekend when we were both working. He slapped a stack of green bar paper, this was a while ago, onto a shelf and pointed to some highlighted numbers. He looked at the shift manager and said, do you see this? This is our average tech sales when you're on shift. See this number over here? This is our average tech sales when you're not. At this point, it would be more cost effective to simply fire you. What do you think? The guy stammered like a toddler caught bullying another kid. Fortunately, he wasn't fired, but the store manager made it clear that when I was on shift, I Was not to leave the tech department unless I was on break or there was a fire. That shift manager never said another word to me.

We survive so well that we can freely complain about survival not being to our liking. 2. The concept of pets. We capture other species not to eat or enslave them, but to be friends with them. 3. We can reflect on the fact that we exist. 4. Sometimes I wonder if other animals think humans are ugly. Like those weird hairless cats. We just have this tuft of hair on top and the rest is naked. While we somehow find each other attractive, I wouldn't be surprised if animals thought look at those weird, almost hairless things walking on two feet. So gross. Five. On Halloween we sometimes dress up like the skeletons inside our own bodies. 6. How easily we lose track of reality. A friend of mine once asked me for the $10 I owed him, only to realize he had dreamt that he'd lend it to me. 7. Humans are insanely tough. A lot of animals go into shock and die from injuries humans routinely bounce back from. Many of the flavors we enjoy come from poisons we're immune to. Humans are better at hot weather and long distance running than any other animal. An ancient hunting method involved jogging after a deer all day until it collapsed from exhaustion. We thrive in a massive range of environments. We handle sleep deprivation better than most animals. Screwed dwarfs. Humans should be the ones with a con. We're the John Mcclane of nature. 8. As individuals, we're unique in our drives, wants and needs. But as a group, we're boring and predictable. 9. The body's ability to heal wounds is fascinatingly overlooked. 10. Humans hold themselves separate from nature. To us, there's nature and then there's humanity. When nature encroaches on humanity, we fight it back. Eleven. We went to the moon not because it was lucrative or to gain something, but purely to say to the other tribe, I'm better than you. 12. We know we are going to die. No other animal carries that weight. 13. Humans can survive a gunshot to the abdomen, but a peanut can kill some of us. 14. We instinctively judge others. It seems to be hardwired into us to stare at someone and form conscious thoughts about them. 15. Our kneecaps are weak as hell. Talk about a design flaw. 16. Imagine life without timekeeping. You probably can't. You know the month, year and day of the week. There's a clock on your wall, dashboard or phone. You live by schedules and calendars. Yet all around us, time keeping is ignored by nature. Birds are not late. Dogs don't check their watches. Deer don't fret over passing birthdays. Man alone measures time. Man alone chimes the hour. And because of this, man alone suffers a paralyzing fear. No other creature endures the fear of time running out.

I heard someone say, if you wonder why an actress stopped working, the answer is probably Harvey Weinstein. It's really sad. I see Sopranos fans asking why the actress who played Gloria Trillo didn't do much else. The big answer is that Harvey Weinstein blocked her career from advancing because she turned down his advances. 2, Kevin Spacey. You never see him in anything anymore. I really loved him in house of cards and American Beauty. 3, Taylor Lautner was huge during the Twilight era. He had fans screaming over Team Jacob and seemed set for a major career after that. But when Twilight ended, he started appearing in fewer projects and it's like he faded out as quickly as he shot to fame. Now you barely hear anything about him. And it's wild considering how massive he was for those few years. 4, L m. F. A released party rock anthem, then sorry for party rocking and then vanished off the face of the earth. 5. If you had told me 20 years ago that the most relevant Olsen sister would be Elizabeth, I'd have been very confused. But here we are. The other two are an unentity and she's part of the biggest film franchise of our generation. 6, Wiz Khalifa. I never really listened to him, but black and yellow was on a loop all through high school. After I graduated, I never heard anything about him again. 7, Ellen Degeneres was known for her be kind brand, but then stories emerged about toxic work environments and how poorly people were treated on her show. Former employees and even celebrity guests spoke out. While her show continued for a bit, her reputation was severely damaged. It's crazy how she went from America's beloved talk show host to someone people view as hypocritical. Eight, Chrissy Teigen was known as the Queen of Twitter and was beloved for her witty social media presence. But then past tweets and messages resurfaced showing her bullying behavior and she faced massive backlash. Brands dropped her and she took a long break from social media. Her reputation hasn't fully bounced back and it's wild how fast things turned for her. 9, Louis CK. Was one of the biggest comedians around until allegations of inappropriate behavior came out. He admitted to it, but his career took a major hit with networks and streaming services dropping his shows and projects. He's tried to make a comeback, but it's clear he'll never have the same mainstream acceptance he once did.

If you're passionate about what you do, you won't work a day in your life. Wrong. It's still really hard work even though you enjoy it. And to make matters worse, you might work so hard to the point where you end up hating the thing you love. 2. Tilt your head back during a bloody nose. You don't want to flood your throat with nose blood. 3. You should spend two months wages on an engagement ring as a marketing slogan. 4, that people are good eyewitnesses. We aren't. Our perception of things sucks. We are prone to so many biases that we aren't even aware of. If I grade papers on an empty stomach, I will grade them lower than if I am not hungry. And I will never admit that to be true, even though it is. 5. In medical school, we're taught that common things are common and that when you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras. Meaning that we should always assume the most obvious diagnosis. Medical students almost always jump to the rarest disease when taking multiple choice tests or when they first go out into clinical rotations and see real patients. 6. You don't need to wait 30 minutes before going swimming after eating. This was just invented by public pools to stop people bringing food into the water. 7. Put ice on a burn. Do not do this. It can rip the skin. Do put The burn under cool water immediately. 8, you hold your breath. If you run out of air while scuba diving wrong, your lungs will explode as you'll float upwards with a lung full of air, and you probably will try to surface anyway. And the air inside them expands. The proper procedure is to scream all the way up to make sure your airways are open. 9. Don't trust someone who won't look you in the eyes. Having social anxiety doesn't make you a bad person, and sociopaths have no problem staring you down.

One, I had a coworker when I was a manager in a major retailer. We were running a project that required third party hiring. Well, in this team was a group of 7 POC who rode together for work. Whenever I was around, they were hard working and quick to listen. But whenever I was at a different location or off for a few days, I would come back and this manager would brief me on how things went. And every time she would bring up how terrible and rude and lazy this group was. And when I would go out to the floor, they would greet me with things like thank god you're back. We were about to quit. It went on like this until one day I was coming back halfway through shift drive time and the group was leaving clearly pissed off, said they couldn't stand her racist ass anymore. Apparently she accused them of being disrespectful and probably stealing like you people do. They ended up filing a case and reporting her.

Every time a black person applied for a job at my old job, this old white lady who was involved in interviews would say he was clean and didn't have those dreads or something similar. 4.

He was beating around the subject until he started talking about my sister and how he ended up sleeping with her a couple months ago and had to tell me. I asked him why he was telling me this.

If you're passionate about what you do, you won't work a day in your life. Wrong. It's still really hard work even though you enjoy it. And to make matters worse, you might work so hard to the point where you end up hating the thing you love. 2. Tilt your head back during a bloody nose. You don't want to flood your throat with nose blood. 3. You should spend two months wages on an engagement ring as a marketing slogan. 4. That people are good eye witnesses. We aren't. Our perception of things sucks. We are prone to so many biases that we aren't even aware of. If I grade papers on an empty stomach, I will grade them lower than if I am not hungry, and I will never admit that to be true even though it is. Five. In medical school we're taught that common things are common, and that when you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras, meaning that we should always assume the most obvious diagnosis. Medical students almost always jump to the rarest disease when taking multiple choice tests or when they first go out into clinical rotations and see real patients. 6. You don't need to wait 30 minutes before going swimming after eating. This was just invented by public pools to stop people bringing food into the water. 7. Put ice on a burn. Do not do this, it can rip the skin. Do Put the burn under cool water immediately. 8. You hold your breath if you run out of air while scuba diving. Wrong. Your lungs will explode as you'll float upwards with a lung full of air, and you probably will try to surface anyway and the air inside them expands. The proper procedure is to scream all the way up to make sure your airways are open. 9. Don't trust someone who won't look you in the eyes. Having social anxiety doesn't make you a bad person, and sociopaths have no problem staring you down.

My ex husband remarried three years ago to this woman, Beth, who came with twin daughters Madison and Mackenzie. They're both 15, same age as my daughter Chloe. When Chloe stays there every other weekend, she has to share a room with both of them because apparently there's no space for her to have her own room in their four bedroom house. Last month, Chloe came back from her dad's place looking exhausted. I asked what was wrong and she just shrugged it off like usual. But when she fell asleep on the couch at seven PM, I knew something was up. My kid never goes to sleep early unless she's sick. The next weekend she came back looking even worse, dark circles under her eyes, cranky all day, complaining about everything. Finally, I cornered her in the kitchen while she was making cereal. What's really going on at your dad's place, I asked. She stirred her lucky charms for like a full minute before answering. The twins think it's funny to make me sleep on the floor. They told me their beds are too good for someone who doesn't really belong in their family. My stomach dropped. What do you mean sleep on the floor? She looked up at me with these tired eyes. They took my pillow and blanket the first night and hid them when I asked, dad. And Beth about it. Madison said I was lying and that I probably just lost them. Beth believed her instead of me. I felt my face getting hot. Where does your dad think you sleep in the bed with them. That's what they tell him. But every night after everyone's asleep, they wake me up and make me get on the floor. They say if I tell dad, they'll make sure he knows what a troublemaker I am and maybe he won't want me visiting anymore. That was it. I grabbed my phone and called my ex immediately. Your daughters are making Chloe sleep on the floor, I said as soon as he picked up. What? That's not true. She shares the bed with them. Ask them right now if that's what really happens at night. There was silence and I heard him calling for the girls. Five minutes later, he called back. They admit they've been making her get on the floor, but they say it's because she kicks in her sleep and keeps them awake. the solution is to make a 15 year old girl sleep on a hardwood floor with no pillow or blanket? Are you insane? We'll figure something out, he said. But I could tell he was already making excuses in his head. No, we won't. I've already figured it out. The next Friday when it was time for Chloe to go to her dad's, I drove her straight to the Hampton Inn down The street from his house. Instead, I walked up to the front desk with my credit card. I need a room for my daughter for the weekend, just her. She's 15. The desk clerk looked confused. Is there an adult staying with her? No, but her father lives two minutes away. If there's an emergency, here's his number. I handed over a piece of paper with my ex.

The reunion was at Lake Tahoe. 60 relatives I hadn't seen since I was 12, all pretending we were some perfect family. My sister Katie had organized the whole thing, rented this massive cabin, matching t shirts with Henderson Family Reunion 2019 in cursive, a photographer, the works. I should have known something was up when they insisted I ride separately. Your car has better gas mileage, dad said. Follow us. We'll stop for lunch halfway. The drive from Portland was eight hours. I'd taken three days off from my job at the bookstore, or spent money I didn't have on gas and a gift for my grandma's 80th. Katie had guilted me for months about missing family events. You never show up for anything, she'd said. Just this once, please. Halfway through Nevada, they pulled into a Chevron outside Reno. Desert heat shimmering off the asphalt. I parked behind Dad's Escalade, went inside for Red Bull and trail mix. The cashier was counting change for some kid buying candy. Maybe three minutes total. When I came out, they were recording me on their phones through the windows, laughing as they peeled out of the parking lot. Mom was filming from the passenger seat. Even my teenage nephew Jake, had his phone up. The group text lit up immediately. 23 messages before I could even process what happened. Hope you brought a map. First one home wins. It's just a prank. Bro, don't be such a baby. Katie sent a gift of someone crying. They thought I'd panic. Panic, call them crying, beg for help. Classic Marcus. Right, the sensitive one. The theater kid who cried during Pixar movies. The one who still went to therapy. The one they called too soft at every family dinner. I sat in my Honda for 20 minutes, engine off, reading their messages. Dad posted a video to the family Facebook group. 67 likes, comments flooding in. Hilarious. Marcus will laugh about this later. Great prank. My aunt commented. He probably needs this. Toughen him up. That's when something shifted. This crystalline moment of clarity. They didn't leave me as a joke. They left me because they genuinely thought I needed to be taught a lesson. About what? Being myself. I turned my car around and drove to San Francisco. No dramatic goodbye text, no explanation. Just turned off my phone and drove west toward the bay. Found a hostel in the tenderloin that first night. Sketchy as hell, but it was 40 bucks and they didn't ask questions. Found a studio apartment that same week. Fourth floor, walk up in the mission. Bars on the windows. Radiator that sounded like it was dying, but it was mine. Bartending job at this dive called the Broken Clock. The owner, Tommy, was this ex Marine who hired me on the spot when I made him laugh during the interview. Deleted Facebook, changed my number the hardest Part was explaining to my old co workers why I needed my last paycheck mailed to a California address. For three months, I built a new life, made friends with the other bartenders, started dating this girl, Sarah, who worked at the coffee shop next door. Joined a community theatre group. Nobody knew about my family. I was just Marcus from Portland who moved for a fresh start. Then the email started. Six months after the Chevron incident, my cousin Derek sent an email to my work address. The one from the bookstore website, apparently

What happened afterwards with your life? I've been dating Sophia for four years when I finally decided to ask the big question. Her parents treated me like their own son, especially after they found out I grew up in foster care. Her little brother would literally follow me around their house, begging me to teach him how to fix engines. Someone who never had a real family, being part of theirs felt like everything I've been missing my whole life. I've been saving every extra dollar from my job at Murphy's Auto Shop for months. The ring wasn't fancy, just a simple band with a small diamond. But it was real, and it was all I could afford. I planned everything perfectly. Sophia's dad was turning 60, and they were throwing this big backyard BBQ. All her family would be there, plus her closest friends. She always said family was the most important thing to her, so I figured proposing surrounded by everyone who loved us both would be perfect. The party was going great. Sophia's mom made her famous brisket. Her dad was telling embarrassing stories about Sophia as a kid, and everyone was laughing and having a good time. After they brought out the birthday cake and saying happy birthday, I figured it was the perfect moment. My hands were shaking as I tapped my beer bottle with a fork to get everyone's attention. The whole backyard went dead silent. Sophia looked confused. At first. Then her eyes went wide. When I got down on one knee and pulled out the ring box, her mom gasped and started tearing up. Her dad had this huge smile on his face. Her friends were already pulling out their phones to record the moment. I opened the box and said all the things I've been practicing in my head for weeks. How much I loved her, how she changed my life, how I wanted to spend forever making her happy. The words just poured out of me. But Sophia just stood there, frozen. Not good. Frozen like she was overwhelmed with happiness. Add frozen like she'd seen a ghost. Liam, she finally said, and I could hear the panic in her voice, I love you so much, but I'm not ready for this. I'm so sorry. The silence that followed was the worst sound I'd ever heard. 30 people just staring at us, not knowing what to do or where to look. I stayed on one knee for probably five seconds too long, trying to process what had just happened. Then, and I slowly stood up, shoved the ring box back in my pocket, and nodded. Okay, I said, because what else could I say? Sophia reached for my arm, but I stepped back. I couldn't deal with her trying to comfort me in front of everyone. I mumbled something about needing to go and walked straight to my truck. The drive home was the longest. 20 minutes of my life. I stayed up all night staring at the ceiling, replaying every conversation we'd ever had. About the future. We talked about getting married, about kids, about buying a house together. How had I read everything so wrong? The next day, I was under the hood of a broken down Chevy trying to lose myself in work, when I heard footsteps approaching. I looked up expecting to see my boss, but it was so.

Someone stole my mountain bike from my apartment's bike rack last month. This wasn't some cheap Walmart bike, it was a 2,800 dollar trek that I'd saved for months to buy. I filed a police report, but honestly I didn't expect much help. The bike had GPS tracking built into the frame, part of the anti theft package I paid extra for. Most thieves don't know about embedded trackers. So I pulled up the app to see where my bike ended up. It was moving through downtown, then stopped at an address about 3 miles away. I waited a few hours to see if it would move again, but it stayed put. The GPS showed it was in someone's garage. I drove over to check it out. Sketchy neighborhood, run down houses, and sure enough, it was my bike. In this guy's open garage next to about six other expensive bikes that definitely didn't belong to him. Here's the thing. I couldn't just call the cops and say my bike is in that garage. They'd need proof it was actually mine, and this guy would probably just deny everything. So I came up with a plan. I went home and printed out fake flyers advertising a cash for bikes business. Made it look like I was buying used bikes, no questions asked. The next day I knocked on the guy's door. Mid 30s, covered in tattoos. Looked exactly like someone who'd Steal bikes for a living. Hey, man, I saw you've got some nice bikes in your garage, I said, showing him the flyer. I buy bikes for cash. Interested in selling any? His eyes lit up immediately. Yeah, I've got some bikes. What kind of prices are you talking? Depends on the condition and model. Mind if I take a look? He LED me straight to the garage, where I counted eight stolen bikes, including mine. My Trek was right there. Still had the custom handlebar grips I'd installed. This Trek looks nice, I said, examining my own bike. How much you want for it? That's a good one, he replied. I'm thinking $800. Perfect. He was trying to sell me my own stolen bike. Tell you what, I said, I'm interested in this track, but I need to check with my business partner about the price. Can I get your contact info and maybe come back tomorrow?

When I turned 15, my mom went from strict to straight up paranoid. One night after dinner, she plopped down next to me with this weird smile and said she was installing a family safety app on my phone. I watched her tap away, giving herself access to everything, my location, photos, texts, even my drafts on social media. It's just to keep you safe, honey, she said, handing my phone back like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. It felt like having a stalker who lived in my house. At first I tried to be cool about it. Maybe it would calm her down, right? Wrong. Things got insane fast. She text me in the middle of conversations asking who I was with. She'd comment on memes I hadn't even posted yet because she was reading my drafts. Worst part, she started replying to my friends pretending to be me. My buddy Jake texted asking if I wanted to hang out. And my mom replied, sure thing, buddy, with way too many exclamation points. Jake called me laughing, asking why I was texting like a soccer mom. I had no idea what he meant until I checked my messages. Then came the day that broke me. I was in history class when Mrs. Wilson pulled me aside. She looked uncomfortable as hell. Liam, your mother called the school. She's concerned about some message you sent about Me? My stomach dropped. I knew exactly what she meant. I texted my best friend Kyle the night before, joking about how our history teacher's haircut looked like she stuck her finger in an electrical socket. It was just stupid, but friend stuff, not meant for anyone else. But my mom had read it and called the school to complain about my private joke. I wanted to disappear into the floor. By lunch, Kyle wasn't talking to me. Neither was Jake. Word got around that my mom was reading everything and suddenly nobody wanted to text me anymore. Some kids even blocked me. It was like my social life had a disease and the disease was my mom. That night, I stared at my phone feeling trapped. But then I noticed something. The tracking app worked both ways. It logged every time someone accessed the account. I spent hours studying those logs and what I found made my skin crawl. My mom wasn't just checking my phone during the day. She was logging in at 1:00am, 2:00am, even 3:00am. She was forwarding my messages to her laptop. She was screenshotting my photos. He was living inside my phone 24 7. So I came up with a plan. I created a fake friend named Daniel, made up this whole persona, gave him a backstory, even found some random photos online to use as his profile pic on a group chat with myself.

He said, wouldn't you rather drive straight to the hospital? Is this some sort of joke? I asked when the officer said those strange words. Instead of asking for license and registration, the cop handed back my license that I'd already pulled out. His face had changed from stern authority to something softer and sadder. I just got radioed in about what happened. I'm terribly sorry for your loss, sir. Before I could ask what loss? He was already jogging back to his patrol car. He turned on his lights again, but this time pulled in front of me and blocked traffic so I could merge left immediately. Other cars moved aside as he created a clear path for me to speed the head. I sat there frozen for a moment before pressing the gas. My hands were trembling on the steering wheel as I tried to process what just happened. The cop knew something I didn't. Something bad enough that he'd let me go without even a warning about my speed. I fumbled for my phone while keeping one eye on the road. I just landed at LAX an hour ago after a three day business trip to see Seattle. My wife Carly hadn't answered when I called from baggage claim, but that wasn't unusual. She often had her phone on silent while teaching her kindergarten class. I called her again. Straight to voicemail. I tried our home phone. Nothing. My chest Started feeling tight as I scrolled to her sister's number. Voicemail. Her mom. Voicemail. My mom. No answer. The highway stretched ahead of me, but I wasn't really seeing it anymore. My mind was racing through possibilities. Car accident, house fire, something at her school. Each scenario worse than the last. The cop had said lost. That word kept echoing in my head. Finally, I called my brother Harvey. It rang four times before his wife, Paulina, answered. She was crying so hard, I could barely understand her. How can she do this? I don't understand why she would do this. Paulina kept repeating between sobs, what? What happened? Where's Carly? Is she okay? I was practically shouting into the phone. Paulina just cried harder. I heard Harvey's voice in the background telling her to give him the phone. There shuffling and muffled voices before the line went dead. I called back three times, but no one answered. I was doing 90 now, weaving between cars. Other drivers honked, but I didn't care. Something had happened to my wife, and no one would tell me what. The exit was coming up, and I took it without signaling. I knew that's where they take her. It was the closest trauma center to her school. The hospital parking lot was a maze, but I abandoned my car in the first spot I saw. Legal or not, I didn't care. I ran through the sliding doors into the emergency room lobby. The smell. Of disinfectant, and fear hit me immediately. I'm looking for my wife, Carly Munos. She was brought here. I didn't even know when or why. The nurse at the desk typed something into her computer. When she looked back up at me, her eyes were watery. She. I knew who I was before I'd even given my name. The security guard will escort you. Her voice was barely a whisper. A large man in a blue uniform appeared and gestured for me to follow. We walked through endless hallways, past rooms full of beeping machines and worried families. My legs felt like they might give out, but I kept moving. The guard didn't say a word, just kept glancing at me with that same sad look everyone seemed to have. We took an elevator to the third floor pediatric ICU. The sign said, why were we in pediatrics if Carly was hurt? My brain couldn't make sense of it. The guard LED me down another hallway, where I could hear crying. Multiple people sobbing behind a closed door. I recognized voices as we got closer. Harvey. Paulina. Carly.

But her face immediately dropped when she realised that we tricked her. My sister in law, Maya, has always been competitive with me since the day I married her brother, Jake. She couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, I tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me and from the moment we announced became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd flash, she'd push harder. Come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nursery and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail when she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages, desperately searching for any evidence of Our name decision. My husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and you first. She wouldn't do that, he said. But I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created a blank interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with Final Decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition and I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think, she'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived. The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations. But I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to her surprise. The next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness. When I walked into her room. She actually had the audacity to say, I hope you don't mind that we ended up using Aurora when she was born. It just felt so right for our daughter. I know you guys were considering it, too. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed her our real pic.

Now they're homeless with kids and I refuse to let them back in my life. When I was 22, I inherited our grandmother's house, a beautiful Victorian with enough space for my brother and his family to stay while they saved for their own place. They moved in with their two kids, promising it would only be temporary, just six months. My brother assured me, we'll be out of your hair before you know it. His wife despised me from day 1. She'd make snide comments about how I decorated, complained that I was too loud when I came home from my nursing shifts and acted like I was invading her space in my own house. She'd rearrange my kitchen without asking, throw away my mail, claiming it was junk, and lecture me about proper household management while I was paying all the bills. The passive aggression escalated weekly. She'd use my expensive shampoo, then deny it when confronted. My leftovers would disappear from the fridge and she'd claim she thought they were communal food when I started labelling everything with my name. She complained to my brother that I was being petty and territorial. I tried talking to my brother about her behaviour, but he always made excuses. She's stressed about money. She's not used to living with other people. You're being too sensitive. Every conversation ended with him defending her and dismissing my concerns. The breaking point came six Months later, I arrived home exhausted from a double shift to find her screaming at me in the hallway. She claimed I've been stealing money from her purse and eating her food from the fridge. Both accusations were ridiculous. I made decent money and kept my own groceries clearly labeled. You've been sneaking into our room, she shrieked, her face red with manufactured rage. I know you took $40 from my wallet last Tuesday. I stared at her in disbelief. I worked 12 hour shifts. When exactly would I have time to rifle through your belongings? Don't lie to me, she spat. I have proof. My brother stood behind her, silent as she launched into a tirade about how I was jealous of their family and trying to sabotage their marriage. When I tried to defend myself, she burst into tears and ran to their room. That night, my brother knocked on my door. His face was stone cold, a look I'd never seen directed at me before. We need to talk, he said. He told me his wife had been documenting everything. Times I allegedly took money, instances where I supposedly threatened her when he wasn't around, photos of missing food items. None of it was true, but he believed every word. She'd created a detailed log with dates, times and descriptions of my supposed crimes. You're toxic and you're tearing our family apart, he said. We're done enabling your behavior. I stared at him in disbelief. This was The same brother who'd cry.

What happened? I woke up during throat surgery when I was 23. They had me knocked out to remove some polyps on my vocal cords, but something went horribly wrong with the anesthesia. When I first opened my eyes, I couldn't move a muscle. I was completely paralyzed from the medicine, but fully conscious. Everything felt muffled at first, like I was underwater. Then I started hearing snippets of conversation. The surgeon was discussing a baseball game with the nurse while he worked on my throat. I tried to scream to let them know I was awake, but my body wouldn't respond. I. I could feel everything. The cold metal of the tools sliding down my throat. The burning sensation as they cut away the growths. The metallic taste of blood pooling at the back of my mouth. But I couldn't even twitch a finger to signal I was conscious. My heart was pounding so hard, I thought it would burst. But the monitors didn't show any change. The paralytic they gave me was working perfectly. Too perfectly. I was trapped in my own body, forced to experience every excruciating second. At one point, the surgeon made a joke about my tattoos. Look at all this ink, he said. Wonder what her parents think. The nurse laughed and said something about kids these days. I wanted to cry, but couldn't even do that. Then things got worse. I felt this sharp, searing pain as something Went wrong. The surgeon swore under his breath. Damn it, we've got a bleeder. My throat was filling with blood faster than they could suction it out. The calm discussion about baseball was replaced with urgent commands. BP is dropping. Get me more suction. Where's that clamp? I. I could feel myself choking, drowning in my own blood, but still couldn't move. That's when the anesthesiologist finally noticed something was off with my readings. He rushed to adjust something in my IV, and everything started fading to black. The last thing I heard was him saying, she's fighting the paralytic. When I woke up in recovery, the nurse asked how I was feeling. I wrote on my notepad. I heard everything. The baseball game, the joke about my tattoos, the bleeding. Her face went white. They pulled my records and discovered my body had metabolized the anesthesia way faster than normal, but the paralytic had stayed at full strength. Apparently, it's a rare genetic condition that runs in my family, something my mom forgot to mention. The hospital tried to sweep it all under the rug. They offered to waive all my medical bills if I sign some papers promising not to sue. But that wasn't what I wanted. I just wanted them to document my case so it wouldn't happen to anyone else. The surgeon and anesthesiologist came to apologize later that day. The surgeon looked like he hadn't slept in days. He kept saying how sorry he was. About the tattoo comments, I wrote back the baseball game was more offensive. Yankees suck. But here's the crazy part. When they checked the surgery recording, apparently they film everything for teaching purposes. They found something disturbing during the bleeding incident.

This way it will sink to the bottom and if someone finds it, they will never know what it originally was. If you want to trespass onto someone's property, bring a dog leash with you.

I was 22, living my best life when my phone exploded with calls from my entire family. My cousin Eve, who was 16, told everyone I'd been sneaking into her room and that she was now pregnant with my baby. The whole family believed her instantly. My parents screamed at me over the phone, calling me disgusting. My siblings blocked me on everything. Even my grandparents, who raised me, wouldn't take my calls. I had zero proof it wasn't true. Eve was the family princess, and I was just a black sheep cousin who barely came around anymore. The accusation spread like wildfire through our tight knit extended family. Aunts and uncles who used to invite me to barbecues suddenly acted like I didn't exist. My mom's sister, Eve's mother, posted cryptic Facebook statuses about protecting our children from predators in our own family. Within a week, I was completely erased from every family group chat, every holiday plan, every. Every graduation announcement. The next year destroyed me completely. I waited every day for police to show up at my door with handcuffs. Every knock made my heart stop. Every phone call from an unknown number sent me into a panic attack. I lost my job at the auto shop because I couldn't focus. Kept making mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss finally sat me down and said, whatever was Going on at home. Needed to stay there, but I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment three months later when I couldn't make rent. Moved in with a buddy who let me crash on his couch. But even he started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Started drinking heavily just to sleep and drinking to get through the day. Then drinking because breathing felt impossible without it. Dating became a nightmare. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried to date asked to meet my parents. After two months, I made up some story about them being dead. Second girl saw through the lies when she noticed I had zero family photos, no childhood stories, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. And when I couldn't give a straight answer, she was gone by morning. The isolation was crushing. Holidays were the worst. Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call. I drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway, knowing they were all inside without me. I finally moved three states away and started completely over. New job, new friends, new identity. Told everyone I met that my family lived far away and we weren't close. Simple, clean lie that people accepted. Got into therapy, got sober, worked my ass off to build something resembling a normal life.

My parents were so worried about me dating a skater boy, they couldn't imagine he'd be the reason I'm still alive today. A few nights ago, my parents found out about my skater boyfriend, Greggy, when his message popped up on my screen at dinner. I love you, too. Who the heck are you talking to? My mom shouted, glaring at the screen of my phone. You're 14. No dating until you're 30. We were very clear. Dad pulled up Greggy's Instagram on his own phone. Border, really? This is who you're risking your future for? I tried to reason with them, but they refused to listen and forced me to block him everywhere. Right there over dinner. You'll thank us when you're in college, mom said, while I sobbed. My friends tried passing messages between us at school, but my parents found out and threatened to call their parents. Eventually, everyone gave up except for Gregorius. Gregorius showed up mysteriously in my Valorant lobby. Hey, Mel, it's been a while, he said, his voice breaking. I miss you, Mel. I know we're not supposed to talk, but let's at least play like we used to. We started meeting in the lobbies every day after that, just playing and chatting about normal things, school friends. My strict parent, he never once tried to convince me to sneak around or meet up in person. He never complained about my Parents or tried to turn me against them when I vent about how unfair they were being, he'd actually defend them. Sometimes they're just scared, he said once my older sister got mixed up with some bad people in high school. Parents get paranoid. He still cared about me in all the ways that mattered. When I failed my chemistry test because I couldn't focus, he spent three hours teaching me balancing equations over discord. When my grandmother got sick, he stayed up until 3:00am just listening to me cry. You can always reach me here, he promised. I don't care what time it is. Mom almost caught us once when she walked by while discord was open. I clicked to my game lobby just in time. Homework break, she asked. I nodded and switched back to my essay. My heart pounding so hard I thought she'd hear it. After she left, Greggy messaged, maybe we should stop. I don't want to get you in trouble, but I couldn't lose him again. He was the only person who I could rely on and thank god I didn't lose him because a couple of days later, my friend Sarah and I got caught up in some shady business. It was supposed to be a normal Saturday night sleepover. Her parents went out for their anniversary, leaving us to watch movies and eat junk food. I was on the phone messaging Greggy on discord when Sarah's older brother Joshua came home from College, completely wasted with two other friends. Sarah immediately tensed up. baby sis and baby girl, he winked disgustingly. He and his friends sat beside us on the sofa, placing his arm over my shoulder, constantly whispering things like, I know you're not as innocent as you act and your parents don't have to know. I pushed his face away and stood up, glaring, can you stop? Sarah was almost crying, begging me not to make him mad. He gets mean when he's drunk, she whispered. Just ignore him and he'll pass out soon. But when Joshua grabbed my waist and tried to pull me onto his lap, I grabbed Sarah's arm and ran to the bathroom, quickly locking the door. He started pounding on it, laughing with his friends about how I was playing hard to get and needed to loosen up. Sarah hopped into the tub, hugging her knees to her chest. I patted my pockets, realizing I had left my phone in the living room. Soon the knocks on the door became angrier. Hitting the door harder, jiggling the handle aggressively, Sarah meekly handed me her phone. I'm so sorry. I had no idea he'd be home. She tried calling her parents, but they didn't pick up. And I didn't have my own parents number.

An old man came up to me and asked, can you slowly take off your shirt? You did he get away from me. I grabbed my beach bag and started to stand up to leave. Wait, you don't understand. Don't move! He held up both hands looking panicked. Get away from here! I'll call the cops. I was already reaching for my phone because this creep needed to be reported. Call them! You need to go to a hospital. His face was pale despite the summer heat, and he was staring at my back with genuine horror. What? I stopped mid dial because something in his voice made me realize this wasn't what I thought. Don't move! He pulled out a whistle and blew it three sharp times. A teenage lifeguard came running over. Within seconds, the man pointed at my back and the lifeguard's eyes went wide. He immediately started yelling for everyone to get out of the lake. Families were grabbing their kids and rushing toward the parking lot. People were looking at me like I had the plague. Ma'am, I need you to stay completely still, lifeguard said in this forced, calm voice. Parker, get Brooke over here now! Another lifeguard jogged over, took one look at my back, and immediately threw up in the sand. What a sissy. Now I was really freaking out what the hell was on me that was making people freak out like this? I tried to turn my Head to see. But both lifeguards yelled at me not to move. Is it a spider? A make? What's on me? My voice was getting higher with each word. The first man who'd approached me was standing a safe distance away. Now I saw them when you sat up to adjust your towel. I've seen this once before, when I was stationed at a lake in Minnesota. We need professionals. The lifeguards were on their radios calling for paramedics. They cleared a huge circle around me like I was radioactive. Other beach goers were taking pictures from far away, and I could hear people speculating about what was happening. Someone said sharks, someone else said jellyfish. But we were at a freshwater lake, so none of that made sense. The Param medics arrived, and two of them approached me slowly, like I was a bomb that might go off. One of them let out a low whistle when he saw my back. Okay, ma'am, we're going to need you to stay very still. This might feel strange, but do not move, no matter what. The older paramedic put on thick gloves and opened a medical kit. I felt scraping on my back. Not painful exactly, but like someone was peeling tape off my skin. Then I heard dropping sounds. Plop, plop, plop, like wet things hitting the sand. With each drop, I felt relief on my back, like pressure was being released. How many are there? The younger paramedic sounded. Disgusted. I'm counting at least 15 so far. Maybe 20. Never seen them this big. The scraping continued. My back started to sting just a little, then more and more. With each scraping motion, whatever was coming off was leaving something behind. The stinging turned to burning. I felt dizzy, and my vision started getting blurry around the edges. She's going into shock. We need to speed this up. The older paramedic worked faster. More plopping sounds, more burning. I looked down and saw dark drops.

When I turned 8, my parents threw me this huge party. All my friends came. We had a bouncy house, pizza, the works. I felt like the luckiest kid in the world. But right as we were about to cut my Ninja Turtles cake, my mom pulled me aside with this panicked look. Honey, we need to tell everyone to go home right now. Daddy is very sick and needs to go to the hospital. I was devastated. My friends left confused. I'm crying because they thought someone was dying. The bouncy house guy packed up while I sat there in my party hat, watching my perfect day crumble. Dad spent three days in the hospital for what they said was a severe stomach infection. I felt so guilty for being upset about my ruined party when he was suffering. But this became a pattern. Every single birthday for the next 10 years, some crisis would strike right before or during my Celebration. When I turned nine, my mom got food poisoning an hour before my sleepover. When I turned 10, my grandma fell down the stairs during my bowling party. 11 was my dad's appendix acting up. 12 was our car breaking down on the way to the amusement park. By 13, I started having panic attacks before my birthday. I'd wake up wondering what disaster would ruin it this time. My friends stopped expecting invitations. Some parents whispered that our family Was cursed or unlucky. I began asking for quiet celebrations instead. Just cake at home, please. But even then, something always went wrong. The power would go out, someone would get injured. There was always something. When I turned 16, I didn't even want to party. I just wanted to go to dinner with my parents. But halfway through appetizers, my mom clutched her chest. I. I think I'm having heart palpitations. I started telling people I hated birthdays. Friends thought I was being dramatic. Just bad luck, they'd say. By 17, I was seeing a therapist for what I thought was birthday anxiety disorder. She kept asking about my family dynamics, but I defended them. They can't help that emergencies happen. When I turned 18, I didn't even tell them it was my birthday. I was planning to just let it pass quietly, maybe treat myself to coffee later. But that afternoon, I came home early from school and overheard my parents on the phone with my aunt

I quickly switched tabs as she approached. Just keeping myself busy. Busy? You're watching someone build a virtual house. She saw my chat messages. Actively participating. This isn't a hobby anymore. It's an addiction. What she didn't see were the other tabs. Supplier emails from China, Shipping trackers, customer service responses. The Twitch streams were just background noise while I managed orders, adjusted Facebook ad campaigns, and negotiated with suppliers about delayed shipments. My sister's husband just bought a rental property, Sarah continued. Meanwhile, I'm telling people you're between opportunities. The truth was, my dropshipping business was finally profitable after six months of testing products. Gaming accessories of all things. Mouse pads with LED edges, custom keyboard caps, cable management systems. I found by watching what streamers complained about. Can you at least come to dinner tomorrow? Pretend you're trying. Her family dinner was torture. Her brother described his new BMW. Her father offered me a pity job at his hardware store. Again, Sarah deflected questions about our future, saying we were figuring things out. Maybe he could drive for Uber, her mother suggested, loud enough for me to hear. Everything unraveled because a doorbell camera notification. Sarah was showing her sister our ring footage to prove our neighbour's dog kept getting in our yard. She scrolled too far back and saw something odd. Delivery drivers. Dozens of them. Every single day. Mike, why are so many packages coming to our house? Her sister leaned in. Are you shopping addicts? Is that why you're broke? There returns, I said quickly. But Sarah kept scrolling. The packages were being picked up, not dropped off. Different drivers collecting them.

He grabbed her arm, dragging her towards the kitchen. My baby's due next month. Please! Not my problem! He shoved her hard. Now clean that up, he said, pointing to the broken glass jar he had dropped after stealing his employees tips. She started picking up glass on her knees, sobbing. Schiller kicked more glass toward her. Faster! I stood up, holding the heavy ceramic plate over my head. Yoo hoo! I whistled before dropping it onto the marble floor. Crash! Everyone gasped. What the? He spun around just as I picked up another plate and dropped it. Sir, what are you doing? That's $700 each! I shrugged, picked up the window glass and dropped it too. Then I walked over to the next tail and swept everything off. Stop! Stop! I'm calling the police! Good! I said. Call them! I kept going. Schiller rushed over and grabbed my collar. You'll pay for every piece! And you'll pay for everything everyone has had to deal with under you! I grinned back at him as he blew up in my face. Everyone stood still, watching us, wondering the same thing. Why? Why was a stranger suddenly throwing around plates? Well, it was for a good reason. The police arrived quickly, walking in, looking just as confused as everyone else was. Mister Schiller grinned, letting my collar go finally. Officers, arrest this man? He demanded snobbishly, pointing at me. The officers raised an eyebrow. You want us to arrest him? He's. I shook my head at them and smiled back at Mister Schiller. Why not arrest you instead

I convinced my entire high school I was colorblind for three years just to win a fifty dollar bet. It started in freshman biology when our teacher was droning on about genetic disorders. Jake Miller, cocky, rich, and always looking for entertainment, leaned over and whispered, I bet you couldn't fake being colorblind for a whole month without getting caught. I've never been able to resist a challenge. Especially from someone like Jake, who drove a BMW his daddy bought him while I worked weekends at Dairy Queen. Make it until graduation and you've got a deal, I whispered back. Fifty bucks says you crack in a month. He smirked, extending his hand. We shook on it right there between plastic models of DNA strands. That night I researched everything about red green color blindness. I Learned about Isihara tests, those dotted circles doctors use, how color blind people navigate traffic lights, and common mistakes they make. By morning, I had a game plan. Day one, I accidentally mixed up my red and green folders in front of our math teacher. Sorry, I mumbled, just loud enough for him to hear. They look the same to me. He paused mid equation. Thomas, are you colorblind? I feigned embarrassment, staring at my shoes. Yeah, I don't really talk about it. Words spread through the teacher's lounge like wildfire. By lunch, my history teacher was asking if I needed special accommodations for map activities. By the end of the week, the school counselor called me in to discuss my learning needs. I committed fully. I bought special colorblind glasses online that did absolutely nothing but look convincing, wearing them dramatically during school events and removing

The first text came around 4 p m. Hey, the key isn't working. Did you lock the deadbolt? I didn't answer. The call started escalating from different numbers. First Olivia, then Marie. By 6 p m, the tone shifted from annoyance to panic. What did you do? There's a storage receipt taped to the door. Are you kidding me? Apparently, they'd spent the night sleeping in the U Haul truck because they had nowhere else to go. When Hannah finally called, screaming about me being a psychopath, I calmly explained, I didn't throw anything out. Your belongings are safe and climate controlled storage. You were a guest who tried to move two other people in and relegate the homeowner to the couch. I just declined your terms. They tried everything. Police, welfare checks. So social media campaigns, lawsuit threats. When police came, I showed them Hannah's texts about me sleeping on the couch and doorbell footage of them screaming at my door. The officer sighed and said, so she tried to move friends in without permission, and now she's claiming you're unstable? I compiled screenshots of their defamatory posts, sent them to Hannah's tech company HR Department. I contacted their old property management company with evidence of their harassment from Marie, the aspiring influencer. I sent her smear campaign screenshots to every brand she'd tagged. Three weeks later, Hannah was fired for violating her company's social media policy. Olivia and Marie were blacklisted from reputable apartments. Marie's influencer dreams imploded when brand started blocking her. The quiet in my house feels like justice.

What I saw will haunt me forever. I've been doing water rescue for eight years now, and most calls are body recovery, not rescue. People don't survive long in these freezing northern waters. But what I found last Tuesday has me ready to quit and never look back. The all came at 2 p m. When a father took his seven year old daughter, Emma, fishing at Crystal Lake. He turned away for 30 seconds to untangle his line. And when he looked back, she was gone. No splash, no scream. Just gone. I knew she was dead before we even arrived because the water temp was 42 degrees. Even if she could swim, hypothermia would kill her in minutes. But we had to try. My dive partner Jake and I searched the main area for three hours, but we found nothing. The current was brutal from recent storms. And that's when I noticed something odd. One of the old creek beds that had been dry for years was flowing again. And heavy rains must have opened it back up. I followed the creek and realized where it LED, which made my blood go cold. The dead zone. That's what the older divers called the deepest part of Crystal Lake. Hundred yard stretch where the water drops to over two hundred feet. We're strictly forbidden from diving there because unpredictable currents will kill you. They Always said. But the creek LED directly into the dead zone. So if Emma got swept into that current, her body would be down there. Jake was searching the other side of the lake, so I made a decision that still haunts me. I geared up and dropped into the forbidden waters alone. The first thing I noticed was how wrong the older divers were, because there was no current at all. The water was eerily still, like swimming in black suit. And I descended fifty feet, then a hundred, with nothing but darkness below. At 150 feet, my light finally hit something, and I thought it was seaweed at first. Long, pale strands swaying in the water. But as I got closer, I realized what I was really looking at. Arms. Hundreds of human arms, growing from the lake bottom like some twisted underwater forest. They were all different sizes, from tiny baby arms no bigger than my thumb, to adult arms thick as tree branches. All of them were pale green and moving slowly, grasping at the water around them. And they had roots spreading through the sediment, like they've been planted there.

I was 14 and I was walking through the mall when I saw a girl my age sitting alone at the arcade playing a racing game by herself. She looked really lonely, mashing buttons and talking to the screen like she had someone to compete with, making sound effects and celebrating when she won races against nobody. So I decided to go over and challenge her to try and make her day better. I walked up to her and asked if I wanted to race against her and I saw her face just completely change. Really? You really wanna play against me? I told her yes and I asked her which game she wanted to play so I could show her some moves. I knew she got excited and was about to pick a two player game, but then at the last second she stopped. She grabbed her backpack and said, the last time someone asked to play games with me and I let them use my quarters, they took all my money and left me standing there with nothing. My mom called me stupid and said stupid kids don't deserve more arcade money and I had to save up my allowance for three weeks just to come back here. I'm not stupid anymore and I'm not sharing. She turned around clutching her bag tight and my heart broke for her. I walked back over and Pinky promised her I wasn't going to take her money and told her I'd use my own quarters right next to her so I couldn't steal anything. I even showed her my wallet to prove I had my own money. She ended up agreeing to play, and when I showed her the combo moves, she was absolutely amazed. She yelled, that's so awesome! Teach me how to do that! She then started practicing really hard, and although she was messing up the timing at first, she seemed so focused and determined.

When she did, she was so thrilled she jumped up and down screaming and called me her awesome new gaming buddy. We took turns playing different games the rest of the afternoon, and she kept getting better and better at everything I taught her. When I told her I had to go home, she looked disappointed, but then asked me if I wanted to meet.

One day, my daughter came up to me and told me she didn't want to stay at daddy's house anymore. I had split custody with my ex, but this was the first time when she outright refused to visit him for her scheduled week. I sat down beside her and asked her what was going on. Did daddy do something to upset you? Then she told me how daddy's new girlfriend would make her do strange things and also made her promise not to tell anyone. When I asked what these things were, my heart dropped into my stomach. She would make my daughter sit in front of a laptop camera and answer personal questions about her body. Then she would record everything and tell her it was just a game. At first, my daughter thought it was normal, but she eventually realized that something felt wrong and became scared. So she asked her to stop. And my ex's girlfriend grabbed my daughter by the shoulders and shook her hard. She went to her daddy to complain and told him everything while sobbing. But instead of protecting her, he told her to stop making up stories. He was under the impression that I had coached our daughter to say this and simply refused to listen to her. I was so furious, but also heartbroken at the same time. The first thing I did was call the police, but the officer Who showed up was my ex's golf buddy, who basically laughed in my face. He told me the same thing that my ex said to our daughter. Stop making up drama just because you can't handle your ex moving on. I don't know what kind of father my ex husband was being that he didn't even consider the possibility of his girlfriend actually doing this. But I knew one thing, which was I couldn't just sit there and do nothing. I sent my daughter to my sister's house before taking action. I was a regular at this gym where I had made friends with these two guys who had done some questionable things in their past. Both of them agreed to help me with my plan. We waited for my ex to leave for his business trip and broke into his house to find the girlfriend. I knew she worked from home, so she was probably in her office all day. She looked absolutely terrified when she saw me entering the house and tried to run, but we cornered her. You see, I was under the impression that she was just some creep getting her

Basic conversation, nothing special. She sends me a paragraph about her weekend plans. I read it, think cool story, and forget to respond because I was cramming for midterms and surviving on energy drinks.

I'm not ignoring you. I'm just living my life without my phone glued to my face. I finally respond, sorry, was studying. How was your weekend? Too late. The damage is done. She replies, studying for 18 hours straight? That seems unlikely. This girl really pulled out a calculator to fact check my study session like I'm filing taxes instead of trying to pass organic chemistry. I say, I had other stuff going on, too. Work, sleep, basic human functions. She goes, I think you're lying. People who are genuinely busy still make time for basic courtesy. Basic courtesy? We've exchanged like 10 messages total. We're not engaged, but Madison's just getting started. She screenshots our entire conversation and post it on her Instagram story with the caption, men really think they can just ignore women with no consequences? No consequences? It's a dating app, not a legally binding contract. Then she finds my LinkedIn somehow discovers where I go to school, and files a formal complaint with the university ethics committee for demonstrating poor character and disrespect.

I thought I hit the Jackpot when the Morrison family offered me $300 to babysit their daughter for one night. I had no idea this would be the last normal day of my life. The job seemed perfect. Rich neighborhood, well behaved kid, easy money. What could go wrong? Everything, apparently. When I arrived at their mansion on Elm Street, Missus Morrison answered the door, looking absolutely exhausted, dark circles under her eyes, hands shaking slightly as she spoke. Thank god you're here, Riley, she said, practically pulling me inside. We haven't had a night out in months. Mr. Morrison came downstairs carrying their seven year old daughter, Sophie. The little girl was adorable, with curly blonde hair and big blue eyes. But something felt off. She didn't smile when she saw me. She just stared. Before we leave, Miss, Missus Morrison said, handing me several folded papers. These are very important instructions. Please follow them exactly. Sophie's special. I nodded, stuffing the papers in my pocket without reading them. Big mistake. They left in a hurry, practically running to their car. I should have known something was wrong when they didn't even say goodbye to Sophie. The first few hours went great. Sophie and I watched cartoons, played board games, ate pizza. She was sweet and polite, nothing like the weird, difficult kids I usually dealt with. Around 7:30 she yawned and said she was getting Tired? What time is your bedtime? I asked. Mommy says I have to be in my room with the door locked by 8 p m, she said. Matter of factly locked? That seemed weird, but rich parents had strange rules sometimes. I figured I'd check the instructions once I got her settled. I tucked Sophie into her bed at 7:55. As I was leaving, she grabbed my arm. Don't forget to lock the door, whispered urgently. And whatever you hear tonight, don't come back in here. Promise me. Why would I need to? Promise me, she said, her grip tightening. Okay, okay. I promise. I closed her door and noticed the heavy duty lock installed on the outside. Not a regular bedroom lock. This was the kind they used in psychiatric hospitals. My hands were shaking as I turned the key. Downstairs, I finally pulled out Missus Morrison's instruction. What I read made my blood turn to ice.

Maya's like, you know, daddy's friend who always sits in the front seat. She gives him kisses goodbye, and her lipstick is super pretty. My stomach dropped so hard, I thought I might throw up right there on the clean laundry. I've been finding red lipstick on his collar for months, but he kept saying it was from work, meetings, handshakes, whatever. I even bought the same shade, trying to figure out where it came from, like some kind of detective. The whole time, it was right there, picking up my baby from school. I'm trying to keep my voice steady because Maya's still chattering away, completely innocent. How long has Miss Britney been picking you up, sweetheart? Maya starts counting on her fingers, tongue sticking out in concentration. Maybe two months. She's really nice and smells like flowers. Oh, and she always fixes daddy's hair before they kiss. Like this. She demonstrated by grabbing her own face and making exaggerated kissing sounds. Not a cheek peck, a real kiss. My seven year old was unknowingly describing my husband's affair in perfect detail. I had to excuse myself to the bathroom, where I sat on the toilet seat and cried for ten minutes, my whole body shaking. All those late nights, all those work emergencies.

Three years ago, my wife Kathy was diagnosed with breast cancer. She fought for five years, but we never knew she was terminal until eight days before she passed.

Then, without warning, the nurse asked what she wanted to do on her last few days. I stared at her. What are you talking about? The nurse's face dropped. Oh, I thought the doctor already told you. I broke down crying. The entire staff gathered around apologizing. But it didn't matter. We had just Learned the fight was over, and no one had told us. Two days before she passed, I was outside installing a new mailbox. Kathy came out and sat in a lawn chair watching me. The sun made her skin look less yellow, and I told her she was looking better. I wanted to believe she was getting better. That night, Kathy started vomiting constantly. By the morning, I told her we needed to go to the hospital. As I helped her get dressed, she was too weak to stand. I called my daughter over, and we decided to call an ambulance. I walked outside to wait. Then the front door burst open. Mom's not breathing. I ran inside. Kathy was sitting on the edge of the bed, eyes open, but she wasn't Breathing, I called 9 1 1, screaming for help. Paramedics arrived and rushed her to the hospital, while I followed behind and called her brother and sister. When I arrived, I begged to be with her, but they wouldn't let me back. The nurse told me they're doing the best they can. I begged her to ask the doctor if I could sit with her. A few minutes later, he returned and let me inside. The room was full of doctors and nurses fighting to bring her back. We have to make a decision. She's not going to make it. I broke down completely and we had to pull the plug. Everything stopped. Kathy was gone. I never got to say goodbye. I was outside waiting for the ambulance, but my stepdaughter told me Kathy's last words. I'm ready.

In fourth grade, a kid named Tyler walked up to me during recess and said, I'll give you five bucks if you pretend to be my twin brother for the whole day. I looked at him completely confused, because Tyler and I looked nothing alike. I had dark hair, he was blond. I wore glasses, he didn't. He was short, I was tall. But five bucks was five bucks, and I wasn't about to turn down free money. So I shrugged and said, deal. That's when I Learned he had already been telling everyone in our class that he had a secret twin who went to another school. Apparently, this started as a joke, but then people actually believed him. And instead of admitting he was lying, he doubled down. Now he needed me to prove it. The plan. Every time someone asked him something, I'd answer for him and vice versa. If a teacher called on him, I had to answer like I was also Tyler. If someone asked me a question, he'd respond like we were one person. It was the stupidest thing ever, but for some reason, people actually bought it. Then in gym class, things went very wrong. We were playing dodgeball when a teacher stopped the game and yelled, Tyler, why are you on both teams? I panicked. Tyler panicked. We both just stood there staring at her, waiting for the other to say something. Then Tyler grabbed his knee, fell over and yelled, Mrs. Davis, I think I'm seeing double. She genuinely looked concerned. She walked us both to the nurse's office, where Tyler kept acting dizzy, saying he felt weird, like there were two of him. We sat there for twenty minutes while the nurse gave him crackers and told him to breathe slowly. By the end of the day, he so committed to the bit that he even wrote my name on his homework and tried to turn it in. The next morning, he handed me a single dollar Bill and said, sorry, I only have this. But you were the best fake twin ever. I never got the rest of my money. Most importantly, Sophie has been dead for three years. What's in that room is something else. Something that found her body and decided to wear it. We can't get rid of it, so we contain it. We've been looking for someone young and healthy, too. Well, you'll understand soon enough. The doors are locked from the outside. There's no cell service here, no landline. You can't leave.

Something was waiting for us. It was ten thirty one PM when my phone buzzed with an emergency alert that said do not enter underground structures such as basements. Stay above ground until they all clear. My husband Mark looked up from his own phone and we stared at each other, both having received the same message. What do you think's going on? I asked, glancing toward our basement door. Our five year old daughter, Emma had been asleep for an hour upstairs. Could be a gas leak or radar issue, Mark replied, but his voice sounded uncertain. I ran upstairs to check on Emma, who was sleeping peacefully in her bed, then came back down to find Mark staring at the TV. The local news channel was displaying the same emergency alert in blocky white letters on a black screen, but when he flipped to CNN and other networks, there was nothing about any emergency in our area. I pulled out my phone and searched Google for any news about the alert, but nothing came up. I texted Sarah, a neighbor from two streets over, asking if she'd gotten the same message. No response. I think we should leave, I said, grabbing a duffel bag from the closet. We can go to my sister's place until this clears up. But Emma has school tomorrow and I have work, Mark protested. Don't you work from home on Mondays, anyway? I replied, already packing clothes and Emma's favorite stuffed animals into the bag. While Mark hesitated, I walked over to our basement door and noticed the chain lock was latched. I hurried to the kitchen, grabbed some duct tape, and started sealing the cracks around the basement door. What are you doing? Mark asked. If it's some kind of gas leak, I don't want it getting into the rest of the house, I said, pulling another strip of tape across the bottom gap. Within 10 minutes, I had packed our essentials and was ready to leave. Mark finally agreed to wake Emma, and we carried her out to the car. Wrapped in blankets. She stirred sleepily, but didn't fully wake up as I strapped her into her car seat. As we pulled out of our driveway, I noticed how quiet the neighborhood was. If everyone had gotten the same alert, wouldn't more people be leaving? The houses on our street were all dark except for automatic porch lights, and there were no other cars on the road.

I've been working at this upscale steakhouse called the Prime Cut for almost four years now, and I've seen more first dates than I can count. Most blend together in my memory, but there was one last Tuesday that I'll never forget. The evening rush hadn't started yet when this woman walked in. Late 20s, wearing a sundress that still had the tags tucked in, clutching a small wrapped gift that looked like it came from the bookstore next door. She was 50 minutes early for her reservation and asked for a specific spot at the bar that she requested when booking. As I set up her area, I noticed her hands trembling slightly as she placed the gift on the empty stool beside her. She kept checking her reflection in the mirror behind the bar, are adjusting her earrings and practicing what looked like conversation starters under her breath. So how was your drive over? She whispered to herself, then shook her head and tried again. Is this your first time at the prime cut? The nervousness was radiating off her in waves. For those 15 minutes, she just sat there nursing a Diet Coke, rearranging her purse, and checking her phone every two minutes. Our manager even asked if everything was okay, and she assured us her date was coming at 7:00. When he finally arrived, the contrast was immediate. He was polished, expensive watch, tailored jacket. But He barely acknowledged her as he slid onto the stool. Before she could even hand him the gift, he pulled out his phone and started scrolling, saying, sorry. Client stuff. You know how it is. The woman's face fell for a split second before she plastered on a smile and gently placed the gift on the bar between them. I brought them water and took their drink orders. A simple wine spritzer for her, a specific brand of Bourbon with exactly two ice cubes, not crushed, for him. When I returned with their drinks, he was still glued to his phone. She was desperately trying to connect, asking about his work, his weekend plans, his thoughts on the restaurant, while he gave one word answers without looking up.

I figured all teenagers slept 14+ hours and still felt exhausted. I'm talking about sleeping from six PM to 10:00am and still needing naps. My parents thought I was just being lazy, so they dragged me out of bed for family stuff. I'd literally fall asleep standing up during conversations. The worst part was watching my social life disappear. My friends stopped inviting me places because I'd either cancel last minute or fall asleep during movies. I remember one time at my best friend Maya's sleepover, all the girls were up talking and laughing at 2 a m. And I was passed out on her couch like I'd been drugged. They took pictures of me sleeping and posted them on social media as a joke. I laughed along, but deep down I felt broken and humiliated. I started avoiding social situations entirely because I was so embarrassed. My boyfriend at the time, Dylan, broke up with me because he said dating me was like dating a zombie. He told me I was no fun anymore and that I cared more about sleeping than spending time with him. That destroyed me because I desperately wanted to be present, but I physically couldn't stay awake. At school, I'd sleep through entire classes. Teachers would shake me awake, and I'd have zero memory of falling asleep. My English teacher, Missus Thompson, pulled me aside after I slept. Through a test and asked if everything was okay at home. Started crying because I couldn't explain that I wasn't staying up late playing video games or partying. I was just exhausted.

I just found my boyfriend's name on a murder list. I moved into apartment 42 with my boyfriend Marcus three days ago. We've been together for five years and finally saved enough to leave our parents houses. He's 24, I'm 22. And this was supposed to be our fresh start together. The apartment was way too good for our budget. Two bedrooms, city part views, balcony deposit free with a five year lease option. The landlord said no inspections, no questions asked. It felt too good to be true, but we were desperate. On our first morning, I found a handwritten note in the kitchen cupboard. Beautiful cursive writing that said new occupier of apartment 42 on the outside. Inside was a 12 rule survival guide from the previous tenant. Missus Prudence Hemmings, who lived here 35 years before her husband died in some kind of incident. Rule seemed insane at first. Never use the elevator between 1:11 and 3:00am. Ignore the window cleaner who appears on the balcony. Don't talk to neighbors claiming to live in apartment 65 to 72 because those burned down in the 80s and everyone died. Keep weapons in every room. Don't babysit Terry's kids from Apartment 26. I thought it was some sick joke until everything started happening exactly as described. At 11:00am, a friendly window cleaner knocked on our balcony door on the seventh floor. He exactly 30 minutes tapping and Calling out, never breaking eye contact through the glass. When he left, I checked every balcony in the building. He vanished completely. That afternoon, I heard the animal noises from apartment 48. Not dog barking or cat meowing. Something else. Something that sounded like it was in pain. Dying slowly, over and over again. At 8:00am the next morning, the postman, Ian, knocked. When I opened the door, he looked at me with sad eyes and said, missus Hemmings left something for you, didn't she? I'm sorry about what's coming. What do you mean? I asked. The rules aren't suggestions, he whispered. They're the only thing keeping you alive. This building feeds on people who don't follow them. That's when I noticed the damp patch on our bedroom ceiling had turned deep red overnight. Not rust or water damage. It looked like blood pooling and spreading, but never dripping. Marcus had been acting strange since we moved in. Distant, jumpy, checking the time constantly. Yesterday, he kept muttering about his early shift, saying he had to leave at 3:15.

For six months, my German neighbor Heidi had been hosting these fancy dinner parties. I could hear through our shared apartment wall. I never got invited, but I could hear everything, including when she'd switch to German with her friends. What Heidi didn't know was that my mom is German. I grew up speaking it at home, but rarely mentioned it since moving to the city. Why would I? Every weekend, like clockwork, I'd hear Heidi and her friends laughing. Die amerikanerin und die banane ist so languish. The American next door is so boring. Or the hat kind gushmack. She has no taste. Once she even joked about my pathetic dating life after seeing me bring home the same guy twice. At first, I brushed it off. Just mean girl talk, right? But week after week, it started to wear on me. I'd catch myself standing in front of my closet, overthinking my outfits. Is my style really that bad? I started ordering takeout from different restaurants to seem more cultured. And walking through our hallway with bags. God, how pathetic is that? The worst was when my mom came to visit. We were speaking German in the elevator when Heidi got in. Mom was mid sentence about her garden back home when Heidi's eyes widened with recognition at the language. She stared at the floor numbers like they were the most fascinating thing she'd ever first Seen. My stomach dropped, not because she'd heard us speaking German, but because I realized how deeply I'd let her comments affect me. I hadn't even told my own mother about the situation because I was embarrassed about not stand standing up for myself. That night, after mom left, I sat alone in my apartment, listening to Heidi's laughter. Through the wall I could hear glasses clinking, music playing, and then, right on cue, hear a mutter zephanio languidly like alswiezie. Her mother looks just as boring as she does.

I'm driving to work last Tuesday when this guy in a lifted truck starts tailgating me aggressively. I'm already going five over the speed limit, but apparently that's not fast enough for him. He's riding my bumper so close I can't see his headlights, flashing his high beams and honking. I don't speed up, he starts swerving into the oncoming lane, trying to pass on a two lane road with heavy traffic. Finally he finds a gap and floors it past me, but not before rolling down his window to flip me off and scream something about learning how to drive. Here's where it gets interesting. The guy immediately cuts back into my lane, nearly clipping my front bumper, then slams on his brakes to teach me a lesson about following distance. I had to break hard to avoid rear ending him. This moron is literally brake checking me after complaining I was going too slow. For the next two miles he's weaving through traffic like he's in fast and furious, cutting people off, running yellow lights, the whole nine yards. I'm just maintaining my normal speed, watching this lunatic endanger everyone on the road. Then I see the construction zone ahead, single lane flaggers controlling traffic, and a long line of cars already stopped. Mister Road Rage doesn't notice until the last second. He slams on his brakes, but he's going way too fast. His truck starts skidding on the morning dew and He slides right past the stopped cars into the construction zone. I pull up safely behind the last car in line and watch through my windshield as this guy's truck gets stuck in wet concrete that the crew was pouring for a new sidewalk. The construction workers are yelling and waving their arms as his rear wheels spin uselessly and what's probably $1,000 worth of concrete mix. But wait, it gets better.

I always thought my older sister was overprotective. Growing up, she'd walk me to school even though her high school was in the opposite direction. She checked my homework, packed my lunches, and always asked who I was hanging out with. It drove me crazy. When I was 13, I wanted to go to my first concert with friends. No parents, just us. She insisted on coming along, sitting rose behind us like some kind of shadow. I remember the burning embarrassment when my friend spotted her. I didn't speak to her for days afterward. In high school, she somehow always knew when I was hanging out with Ryan, this guy she thought was trouble. She'd conveniently need to pick me up early or would show up with some urgent reason. One night, she literally pulled me out of a party where there was drinking. Screamed at her in the car that she was ruining my life. She just gripped the steering wheel tighter and said, hate me now if you need to. When I moved away for college, she'd call every Sunday without fail. She'd ask about my classes, if I was eating right, did I need money for books. I'd rush through these calls, annoyed at her constant hovering. Sometimes I'd accidentally miss her calls, texting later with flimsy excuses. For my 21st birthday, she surprised me by flying cross country. I had plans with friends that Weekend. But she'd already booked us tickets to this play I'd mentioned once months before. I reluctantly canceled my parties. She seemed so happy during that weekend that I couldn't bring myself to tell her how much her visit had disrupted my life. Last year she planned this huge family reunion for our parents anniversary.

I've been living with Jake for eight months when I started noticing my adderall running out faster than it should. At first, I thought maybe I was taking extra doses during final stress, but the numbers weren't adding up. I'm prescribed 30 pills per month, one daily, but by day 20, I'd only have five pills left. This happened three months in a row. Jake was the obvious suspect. He had access to my room where I kept my medication, and had been acting weird. New clothes, expensive dinners, always had cash when he used to be broke. Must be miscounting, he'd say when I mentioned running out early. ADHD brains, right? The thing is, I'm a pharmacy student. Tracking medication is literally what I do. For my senior thesis, I was researching prescription drug diversion, so I've been documenting everything. I decided to set a trap. I bought a small spy camera from Amazon and hid it in my bookshelf, aimed at my desk, where I kept my medication. Then I marked each pill bottle with a tiny dot and photographed every pill from multiple angles. I also started a spreadsheet tracking the exact number of pills, their characteristics, and when I took them. If Jake was stealing, I'd have proof. Three days later, I reviewed the camera footage. There was Jake, 2 p m. On Tuesday, going through my desk while I was in class. He opened my prescription Bottle shook out several pills and put them in his pocket, but I wanted to catch him in the act and see how deep this went. I checked our university's anonymous tip form where students buy and sell things. Sure enough, there was a post from username Jake M94 selling study aids for $20 each. The post had dozens of responses from desperate students looking for Adderall during midterms. I created a fake account and message Jake's username pretending to be a freshman needing study help. Hey, I heard you have study aids available. My roommate mentioned you might have adderall. Yeah, I got the good stuff. Prescription grade, $20 per pill. Meet at the library. He was selling my medication for $20 per pill. Pills that cost me $5.

I'm running on three hours of sleep and the emotional stability of a wet napkin. I stumble into this bougie coffee shop downtown. You know the type. Edison bulbs everywhere. Baristas who look like they exclusively date people with septum piercings and a chalkboard menu written in cursive so fancy it might as well be hieroglyphics. I order a simple cappuccino. Nothing crazy. No oat milk, no extra shots, no interpretive dance on top. Just caffeine in a cup so I can pretend to be a functioning adult. The barista, let's call her Luna, because of course, that's her name, makes my drink with the intensity of someone performing surgery. She's got this little metal pitcher steaming milk like she's summoning spirits. Takes her a solid five minutes to create what I can only describe as the Mona Lisa of foam art. She slides across the counter with this proud smile and goes, I made you a swan. I look down. It's beautiful. Beautiful, like, genuinely impressive. This foam swan is sitting there looking more elegant than I've ever looked in my entire life. I'm genuinely appreciative. So I say, oh, wow, that's really cool. Thanks.

I I was 16 when my high school got a new Korean math teacher, Missus Park. On my first day in her class, she looked surprised to see me, but said nothing. I heard her mutter in Korean, great, another banana. Yellow on the outside, white on the inside. For the next month, she'd make comments about me in Korean during class, thinking I couldn't understand. She called me the fake Korean and the whitewashed one. When I got good grades, she'd say in Korean that I must be cheating because adoptees are usually stupid. Other Korean students in class would laugh at her comments. Some even joined in, making fun of how I use chopsticks wrong or how I couldn't read Hangul. Missus park encouraged it, praising them in Korean for keeping their culture pure. During parent conferences, she switched between perfect English with my parents and Korean with other Korean parents. My parents she praised my performance, but in Korean she told other parents I was a disgrace to our people and that adoption should be banned. One day, she paired me with a Korean student for a project. In Korean, she told him to do all the work because the adopted one will just mess it Up! That's when I'd had enough. I turned to her and said in perfect Korean, I may be adopted, but at least I'm not a bitter teacher who bullies children. Classroom went silent. Missus Park's face turned white. She started stuttering in both languages, trying to explain herself. The Korean students who had laughed at her jokes sank in their seats.

Political royalty who thought money could rewrite history. I was sixteen. House party, underage drinking. Typical teenage stupidity. When Emma Rodriguez ended up in a coma from hit and run that night, everything changed. Police found my car with front end damage. I've been drinking. Couldn't remember driving home. Physical evidence pointed to me. Vehicular assault charges followed. But I knew something was wrong. The damage was on the wrong side. Paint transfer didn't match. Three days before trial, I got a USB drive. Security footage showing the real driver, Trevor Maxwell, the mayor's son, drunk, behind the wheel of his father's identical car. Timestamp showed him hitting Emma and swapping cars while I was passed out. Perfect crime. Except for one camera. I gave the video to my public defender. She said it would change everything. Next morning, she called. Video was corrupted, couldn't be used. Suggested a plea deal. The Maxwells had bought her silence. Buried the only evidence that could save me. I took the plea. 18 months in juvenile detention while Trevor walked free. Got into Harvard, started his perfect career. But I made copies of that video. Hidden them everywhere, waiting for the right moment. Trevor became everything his family wanted. State senator at 28, being groomed for governor. I spent 10 years building my case. Financial records showing payments to my lawyer, communications between Trevor and his father, medical evidence proving my innocence. Trevor was running for governor, scheduled for a live debate, watched by Millions. Perfect Platform for truth. I had infiltrated his campaign as volunteer, worked up to social media coordinator. Had access to live stream controls. During commercial break, I uploaded evidence to every platform. The video, financial records, medical reports proving Trevor's guilt and the cover up. Before debate resumed, I texted him. Check your Twitter mention.

They started with their usual routine. Hello, we're conducting a survey about kitchen appliances. I immediately cut them off and said, oh, perfect timing. I'm actually conducting a survey about prank calling habit. There was a confused pause, and they said, excuse me. What? I said, since you're clearly a prank caller, this is a great opportunity to gather research data. Can you please rate your prank calling technique on a scale of 1 to ten? I tried to deny it, but I pressed on with complete seriousness. Sir, this is for scientific research purposes. I need to document various prank calling methodologies. Now, would you describe your approach as amateur or professional level? The caller was clearly thrown off and actually started answering my questions. They said, well, I guess I'm pretty good at it. Excellent. I said, now can you demonstrate your range of fake voices for my study? They actually started doing different accents like they were auditioning for a voice acting role. I took detailed notes and said, fascinating. Now tell Me. What inspired you to get into prank calling? They spent five minutes explaining how they started prank calling as a hobby in middle school. Very interesting. Now, for research purposes, can you rank your top three prank call? Top. They enthusiastically listed fake surveys, wrong numbers, and pizza delivery pranks. I said, excellent data. Now I need you to demonstrate each technique with a brief example. This person actually started performing different prank call scenarios while I pretended to take scientific notes. 20 minutes into this fake interview, I said, now I need you to rate your own performance today. They said, honestly, this might be my best work. I really felt like I connected with my subject. that's interesting, because technically, you just got reverse prank called. There was dead silence, and I could hear them processing what just happened. They said, wait, you're not actually conducting research? I said, nope, but congratulations.

My parents had this annoying habit of shutting down every request I made with the same exact phrase. When you pay rent, you can make the rules. Didn't matter what I asked for your bedtime, different dinner, friends over on weekdays, the answer was always the same. When you pay rent, you can make the rules. I was 14 and getting sick of hearing it, so I decided to take them literally. I started saving. Every birthday dollar, every allowance payment, every lawn mowing job. For three months, I hoarded money like I was planning to buy a car. My parents thought I was being responsible. Little did they know, I was plotting their destruction. I looked up our monthly rent online. Turns out we paid one 2 hundred dollars a month. I counted my savings and had exactly one 2:47 perfect. One Tuesday morning, I walked into the kitchen where my parents were drinking coffee and reading the news. I slammed a stack of cash on the table and said, here's this month's rent payment. My dad nearly choked on his coffee, and my mom just stared at the money. What is this for? I said, well, you always told me when I pay rent, I can make the rules, so I'm paying rent. My dad tried to hand the money back, but I stepped away from the table. Nope. A deal's a deal. I'm Officially a rent paying tenant now. My mom said, honey, we didn't mean it literally. I said, too late. The transaction is complete and as the new co landlord, I'm implementing some house rules. I pulled out a typed list I prepared and started reading my new regulations. Rule No. 1 mandatory family dance time every night at seven PM. No exceptions. Rule No. 2 pizza only Tuesday. We're ordering pizza every Tuesday from now on. Rule number three no news during breakfast. Only cartoons are allowed on the TV. My parents looked at each other like I'd lost my mind. My dad said, this is ridiculous. You can't. I just pay rent and take over the house. I said, actually, according to your own logic, I can. You've been telling me for years that rent equals rule making power. My mom tried reasoning with me. Sweetie, we'll give you the money back. Just stop this. I shook my head. Sorry, but I've already invested in this household. As a paying tenant, I have rights. That night at seven PM, I turned on music and announced it was mandatory family.

Family takes care of family, my father would say. But family also pays family back. The tradition went back four generations. My great grandfather started it during the depression, supposedly to teach financial responsibility. Every adult child paid their parents back in monthly installments. Some took decades to clear their debt. My older brother Jake signed his repayment contract at 18, dropped out of college to work construction. 10 years later, still paying. My sister Maria became a nurse specifically because medical professionals pay off debt faster. When my 18th birthday approached, I did something nobody had ever done. I research.

He was just Tommy, the gentle giant who helped grandma pull weeds, always let the younger cousins win at board games, and laughed like a foghorn when something genuinely made him happy. He was everyone's favourite. Every Friday night, our entire family would gather at my aunt's house for dinner. That night, like always, Tommy was sitting cross legged on the floor playing Mario Kart with my little brother, while whiskers, our 17 year old family cat, slept in his usual warm spot near the sliding glass door. Whiskers was ancient. He had survived two house moves, four new babies, and more toddler tailpulls than any living creature should have to endure. We all joked he'd outlive us. Out of nowhere, my little brother came racing in with his new remote control car, zigzagging through the living room like a maniac, showing off to everyone. The car flew right under Tommy's legs. Just as he started getting up to grab a second plate of pizza, his foot caught on the corner of the carpet. He lost his balance. I watched it all in slow motion. His arms flailed his face, and then came the soft, dull crunch when he landed. Most people didn't even hear it, but I did. Whiskers didn't move. He didn't hiss. He Didn't cry. Just silent. The whole room froze. Tommy stayed on the floor, pale as a ghost, whispering no over and over while his eyes filled with tears. My dad crossed the room and gently picked up whiskers, wrapping him in the fleece blanket from the recliner, the one whiskers always curled up on. My mom quietly ushered the rest of us into the kitchen. From behind the doorway, I could see Tommy sitting there, shoulders heaving as he sobbed. My aunt knelt beside him, rubbing his back and trying to hold it together. But even she looked shattered. That blanket never came back. By the time we left that night, every trace of whiskers was gone. His toys, his bed, the food and water bowls by the fridge. It was like someone hit delete on his whole existence. We never talked about it again. No one.

So here's the situation. I have an identical twin, Marcus. We look exactly the same, sound the same, even have the same weird cow lick that makes us look like we got electrocuted by the same toaster. The only difference is he's the smart one, and I'm the one who once tried to microwave a Pop Tart. Still in the wrapper. We're both seniors, but we take completely different classes. He's in AP everything that makes your brain hurt. I'm in regular human classes for people who think algebra might be a country. Last Tuesday, I'm sitting in my criminal justice class. And yes, the irony will become clear when my teacher, Mister Rodriguez, walk. Then, looking like someone stole his lunch money and his dignity, he slams a stack of papers on his desk and says, we need to talk about academic integrity. I'm thinking, cool, a lecture about not copying homework. Time for a nap. But then he locks eyes with me. Just me. Like I personally betrayed him and his entire family lineage. You, he says, pointing directly at my soul office. Now I look around, confused. Me? What did I do? Don't play dumb, sir. I'm not playing anything. This is just my face. So I follow him to his office, and he pulls out a test paper. But here's the thing. It's not from his class. It's from AP Physics. You Know, the class I've never taken, would never take, and couldn't pass if my life depended on it? He slides it across the desk. Explain this. I stare at the paper. It's got my name on it. Well, technically, it says M. Johnson, but we have the same last name, same first initial. And the handwriting looks exactly like mine. Because it's Marcus's handwriting. Because we're twins. Because genetics is a thing. Mr. Rodriguez, I say slowly, I don't take physics. Leans back in his chair like he just caught me in the lie of the century. Really? Then how do you explain getting a perfect score on yesterday's quantum mechanics exam? I blink. I don't even know what quantum mechanics means. I thought it was a type of car repair. He's not buying it. He pulls out another paper. This one's from AP Calculus. Also signed M. Johnson. Also, my brother's identical.

So I made his life a living hell. We moved into our house three years ago, and everything was perfect until Logan moved in next door six months later. He's maybe 35, works from home doing something with cryptocurrency, and has way too much time to monitor everyone else. No trespassing signs every five feet along his fence. Guy even painted his grass with some kind of spray to make it look more green, which was weird, but whatever. My daughter Zoe plays in our backyard all the time. She's 8, loves soccer, and kicks the ball around for hours. The yards are separated by one of those low, decorative fences, maybe two feet high. And sometimes her ball goes over like any normal kid. She'd hop over, grab it, and hop back. Takes literally ten seconds. Last Tuesday, Zoe was playing when her ball went over Logan's fence. She hopped over to get it, and I watched from the kitchen window as Logan came storming out of his house. He started screaming at her. I could hear him yelling about property rights and respect for boundaries at an eight year old. I ran outside and told Logan to back off. Zoe was crying and ran inside. I explained that kids sometimes chase balls. It's not a big deal, and asked him to not yell at my daughter. Logan got up in my face and said, your little brat needs to Learn boundaries. This is my property, and I don't want her stepping foot on it ever again. I told him she was just getting her ball and would be more careful, but he wasn't having it. Then yesterday came, so he was playing again when her ball went over. She looked at me through the window, and I nodded. It's a ball, for crying out loud. She hopped over, grabbed it, and started hopping back. That's when Logan appeared with his phone already dialing. I couldn't believe it. I ran outside as Zoe came back, confused and scared because this grown man was on the phone with the police about her. 20 minutes later, a police car pulled up the office

For the first few days, I felt terrible for Emma. She was absolutely destroyed. She barely ate, couldn't sleep, kept apologizing every five minutes. I could see how guilty she felt, and I genuinely didn't want her to torture herself over it. It was an accident, right? She didn't mean to almost kill me over a spider. But then I started thinking about it more. I talked to Tyler and his girlfriend, who saw the whole thing. They said it wasn't just, like, a quick reaction. She grabbed that candle holder and kept hitting me. Even after the spider was obviously gone. Even after I was bleeding and unconscious on the deck. The burns healed slowly. Every morning, I'd look in the mirror and see these angry red marks all over my face. People at work would stare, and I'd have to explain that my fiance accidentally burned my face off because of a spider. It sounded insane, even saying it out loud. Three weeks later, we were having dinner, and Emma was telling me about her day when a fly landed on the table. Just a regular house fly. She saw it and immediately grabbed a kitchen knife. Not to kill the fly. She was holding it like she was ready to stab something. The look in her eyes was the same look Tyler described from that night. That's when it hit me. This wasn't just about being afraid. Of bugs. Something was seriously wrong here. And I was the one who was going to pay for it next time. I sat her down the next day and told her I thought we should call off the engagement. I tried to be gentle about it. I said I didn't blame her, and I didn't want her to blame herself either.

Yeah, but they look normal and I don't. You're too focused. It's unnatural. Apparently I was reading with too much concentration.

You've been here for 47 minutes. You haven't checked your phone once. You're sitting perfectly still. That's not normal human behaviour. It's called paying attention to what I'm reading. Exactly. Too attentive. Serial killers are attentive. She just compared me to serial killers because I wasn't scrolling TikTok every five seconds. That's when her friend shows up.

I was flying to Chicago for a job interview when my flight got delayed for six hours. I'm sitting at the gate feeling sorry for myself when this old man next to me starts having trouble breathing. Everyone's just staring, so I help him sit down and get him some water. He thanks me and we start talking to pass the time. He tells me he's flying to see his grandson graduate college. But he's nervous because they haven't spoken in 15 years. Apparently, his son died in a car accident. He blamed his daughter in law for it. He said some horrible things and she moved across the country with his grandson. He's been trying to reach out for years, but she won't return his calls. He finally decided to just show up at the graduation ceremony. I felt bad for him and told him about my own situation. How I was flying to interview for my dream job. But I was terrified because I've been unemployed for eight months and this was my last shot. We spent hours talking and he gave me advice about staying confident. When our flight finally boarded, we exchanged numbers and I wish each other luck. Three days later, I'm sitting in the waiting room for my interview and the receptionist calls my name. I walk into the office and nearly fall over. The hiring manager is the same old man from the Airport. We both just stare at each other in complete shock. He starts laughing and asks how Chicago treated me. I tell him I was too nervous to really see the city, but meeting him made the trip worthwhile. He looks at me seriously and says he has to ask me something before we start the interview. He wants to know if I still think he should go to his grandson's graduation. I tell him absolutely, and that life's too short to hold grudges. He smiles and tells me I'm hired. Then he pulls out his phone and shows me a picture from the weekend. It's him hugging a young man in a cap and gown. He went to the graduation and his grandson ran up and hugged him the moment he saw him. His daughter in law had been hoping he'd come for year.

In my 15 years working at maximum security, I met thousands of inmates, but none like Omar. He was serving 25 years for shooting someone during a robbery gone wrong. The thing is, he wasn't the shooter. His brother was. Omar took the fall because his brother had three young kids. The first time I saw Omar, he was teaching another inmate how to read in the library. Not unusual, except this was at 3 a m. See, Omar had worked out a deal with the night guards. He'd help clean the cafeteria after hours in exchange for using the library to tutor guys who were too embarrassed to be seen learning during the day. I remember asking him why he bothered. Looked at me and said, everyone deserves a chance to write letters home to their mama. Simple as that. What really got me was how he handled the gang stuff. We had major problems with rival groups, but Omar somehow stayed neutral. One day, two gangs were about to go at it in the yard. Omar walked right between them, pulled out a chessboard and challenged both leaders to a game. Said whoever won would get his dessert portions for a month. These tough guys, covered in tattoos, actually sat down and played. By the time they finished, they'd forgotten what they were fighting about. Omar lost his pudding cups.

It was always Jordan or him when she talked to her mom about me. But there she was, reaching her good arm toward me, like I was the only person in the world who could fix this. I dropped everything.

The nurse came in with discharge papers and a bright yellow cast. Ava looked up at me with these huge brown eyes and asked if I could stay with her that night because her arm felt scary. I called Katie. She was stuck at work and couldn't get there until morning. For the first time in four years, I said yes without checking my calendar first.

I got banned from all school events for switching out all the interview questions at a beauty pageant. Thirty minutes before showtime, my best friend Carmen looked at me through the curtains, her face full of panic. I grinned at her and put two thumbs up, whispering, okay, let the show begin. The lights dimmed and the host on stage shouted, and now for the question and answer portion of the show. Let's bring out our top five contestants. Finally, my best friend Carmen didn't think she'd make it this far, but I knew she was kind and beautiful and deserved it way more than the bratty. Harper greeted us with a typical mean girl line every morning at school. Hi, losers! I held my breath as they called Carmen to the front, along with Harbor and three other girls who looked just as nervous. Harbor looked confident, but she wouldn't be soon, not with what I did behind the scenes. The host called Harbor first. Judge fished a question from the bowl while she stood there in her designer dress and perfect posture. Who is your role model and why? She started strong? The three pillars of leadership that have guided my journey are. Then she froze. Her eyes went wide. That wasn't the question she was looking for. She tried to recover, but by then the timer had run out. The host tried to push her to the Side to call up another girl, but stood there malfunctioning like a robot. These aren't the right questions, she finally snapped at the judges. The audience gasped at her outburst. I laughed on the side, thinking she deserved it after all the terrible things she did to other people at school. Harper's mom stormed onto the stage and demanded they stop everything. Someone switched the approved questions. This is sabotage! She screamed. The principal hurried onto the stage and fumbled with the microphone. We'll be having a 10 minute break before continuing the Q&A. Please help yourself with some refreshments. The crowd grew loud, already making theories as to what happened. After a few minutes, the principal called me over. Oh no! I took in a deep breath and followed the towards the security room. They sat me in front of the screen and pointed. Mind telling us what you were doing at 2 p m? The footage showed me switching out the pieces of paper from the bowl very clearly. I'll tell you what she was doing.

My sister Gwen told mom I was a domestic terrorist for taking 20 minute showers before school. And mom believed her. Gwen used to be cool when we were younger. We'd stay up watching movies and she'd sneak me candy when mom said no more sugar. But she turned into a huge jerk when she came back home from her first semester of college. She start acting like a house was her personal hotel and everyone else was just in her way. First it was the TV. She changed all the streaming passwords so only she could log in. Even told our twelve year old brother to grow up when he wanted to watch cartoons on Saturday morning while she binged Love Island all day. Now, apparently, my bathroom was her territory, too. I tried to be considerate, I really did. I'd set my alarm 10 minutes earlier so I could be done before she woke up. I kept my shampoo and stuff in a basket so everything was clean and organized and she wanted to use it. And still she complained. Gwen told our parents I was hogging the bathroom every morning, even though I showered an hour before she woke up. She complained that the steam from my hot showers made the bathroom more moldy and toxic and gave her asthma. But it was summer, so I only took cold showers. Mom scolded me, telling Me to be more considerate of my sister. But that only made her lies older. She started setting her alarm for 6:00am just to me in the bathroom. Then she'd tell our parents I woke her up. So mom scolded me again, texting, be quieter next time your sister needs sleep. The lie that really got me into trouble was when Gwen claimed she lost her dream job at a marketing firm because I hogged the bathroom that morning. I finished my shower when I heard her phone blaring job interview today over and over. But Gwen was dead to sleep. Now, I could have let her miss it, you know, especially after everything she done. But I still tried to wake her up. I shook her shoulders, turned on the lights, even pulled off her blankets. Nothing worked. When she finally did wake up, she had 20 minutes to get to her interview. She came home sobbing, mascara running down her face, saying the interviewer specifically mentioned she looked disheveled. She blamed my morning showers for ruining her career.

Dad slept on the couch from day one. Mom took the bedroom. I got a mattress on the floor of the walk in closet. They said a crib wouldn't fit anywhere else. Closet smelled like Mom's perfume and Dad's Cologne. Everything in our house had an owner. Mom's T V, Dad's coffee maker, Mom's milk, Dad's bread. They labeled everything with a label maker. The leftovers, the salt, even the ice cubes. I found labels on things you wouldn't believe. Mom's toilet paper, Dad's light bulbs. I ate cereal with water because Mom's milk was off limits and dad didn't buy any. I Learned to like black coffee at age 7 because the creamer was Mom's. I lost 12 pounds in fourth grade. The school nurse called home. They both showed up and blamed each other for starving me. Dinner would be silent. We'd sit at the same table, but they'd cook separate meals. Mom made pasta, dad made sandwiches. They'd eat at the same time, stare straight ahead. If I wanted food, I had to ask both. Usually got told no by both. Ask your mother, ask your father.

She'd call the cops reporting a kidnapping. The cops knew our address by heart. Officer Desanto brought my 10th birthday present. A journal. You're gonna need therapy, he said. I stopped wanting birthdays by age 10. Then they started communicating through me. Tell your mother I paid the water Bill. Tell your father he's three days late. I was 11 years old, delivering divorce threats across the dinner table. By 12, I was writing their hate messages down because they wanted documentation. I have three notebooks full of their messages to each other through me. When I was 13, mom started dating. She'd bring men home while dad was in the house. Dad started bringing women home, too. They didn't.

I was 10 when my Uncle Mike started taking me to the arcade every Saturday. Just us two. No parents, no cousins. Our secret guy time, he'd say with a wink. Mom would hand me some cash and off we'd go in his rusty blue pickup truck. I felt so special, like I'd been chosen for something important. All my friends were jealous when I'd come back with stories about beating the high score on Pac Man or mastering Street Fighter. Go! Mike would cheer me on and buy me ice cream after, no matter how badly I played. You're getting better every time, champ, he'd always say. For three years straight, not a single Saturday was missed. Rain, snow. Even when I had a cold. Uncle Mike would show up at 10:00am sharp. I'd run to the door before he could even knock. When other kids complained about their boring uncles, I'd brag about mine. My Uncle Mike is different, I tell them. He actually likes spending time with me. I felt like the luckiest kid in the world. Then one Saturday when I was 13, Uncle Mike didn't show up. My mom found me sitting on the porch steps, jacket on, waiting. She looked strange. Sad, almost. Uncle Mike can't come anymore, she said quietly. I cried the whole afternoon, feeling abandoned. I didn't see him for years after that. Nobody talked about him. And when I asked, They changed the subject. I figured he just stopped caring about me. Last week, I was helping mom clean out the attic when I found a shoebox filled with old photos. It was a picture of me and Uncle Mike outside the arcade, both of us smiling with ice cream cones. Remember that? Mom asked, peering over my shoulder. Yeah, I said. I miss those days. Why did he stop coming? Mom sat down beside me, holding the photo. Your father found out Mike was using the arcade trips to meet his drug dealer. She said.

On the second night, we were playing cards in the living room when the power suddenly went out. We checked the breaker box, but nothing was wrong.

That's when we heard it scratching at the back sliding door. Through the glass, we could see a man in a black hoodie trying to force the lock open. My heart dropped. I wanted to call the police, but my phone had no signal. The storm from earlier must have knocked out the cell towers. We were on our own. My friend Sophie, who's normally the quiet one, suddenly whispered, I have an idea. She pointed to the stairs leading to the basement. We need to lure him down there. The basement had a heavy metal door that locked from the outside. If we could get him down there, we could trap him until morning when the police could come. We positioned ourselves in the darkness. One by the basement door, two behind the couch, and me near The kitchen. Then we deliberately made noise upstairs. Like we were all sleeping up there. And left the basement door open. With a flashlight shining on my uncle's expensive watch collection. Within minutes, the back door slid open. The man crept through the kitchen, crowbar in hand. He spot out of the open basement door in the gleaming watches. Just as we hoped, he headed straight for them. The moment he was halfway down the stairs, Sophie slammed the door shut. And we all piled furniture against it. We could hear him banging and shouting from below. That's when things got weird. My friend Tyler grabbed my uncle's old Halloween decorations from the closet.

Beanies are not formal. The rule is the rule. You could wear a wig if you're that concerned. I was stunned. A wig? I couldn't afford that. And it felt so humiliating. I went home that night and read her email over and over. Formal and business appropriate. That vague wording was her mistake. The next morning, I walked in wearing a fascinator.

When they denied my wife's chemo saying it was experimental while approving the exact same treatment for others. My wife got diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer in February and the cancer doctor gave us the treatment plan that same day. Standard FDA approved treatment that everyone gets with nothing experimental about it. We sent everything to insurance feeling good, but the denial came back in two days claiming the treatment was investigational. Called right away and could hear the woman typing while I talked, not even listening. She kept saying their medical team decided it was experimental, my wife's doctor literally wrote that this was standard care. When I asked if anyone even looked at the medical records, she just repeated that their review team makes determinations based on coverage guidelines. I filed an appeal and attached 15 medical studies showing this was standard treatment, but the second denial popped up in my email 20 minutes after I hit submit. My wife saw the timestamp and started crying. They don't care if I die, do they? I couldn't answer because we both knew the truth. That night I found an online support group where three people with our exact diagnosis got in approvals, and one woman messaged me saying her treatment got approved in two days with the same medicine at the same dose, but different insurance. That's when everything clicked. I spent the weekend digging Through state insurance law, and discovered they had to respond to every appeal within 72 hours, and pay $600 for each external medical review we requested. So Monday morning, I put their system to the test. I called to file an appeal for the denial of Abraxas, and heard the representative side before he even spoke. He kept insisting I'd already filed appeals for that medication, but I explained this was for the 500 milligram dose specifically, since the others were for treatment in general. Pulled up their denial letter and read it back to him, explaining how they evaluate each aspect separately. So I'm also filing appeals for the 100 mg dose, and for weekly versus biweekly scheduling. When he said that would be three separate appeals, I told him it was actually more, because I needed to appeal each of the 12 infusions separately, plus each anti nausea medication.

Weird, painful cysts rupt it all over my face and neck. Deep, angry bumps that hurt to touch. I'd never had acne like this in my entire life, not even as a teenager. Bianca was incredibly sweet about it. She'd examine my face with genuine concern, tracing the inflamed areas with her fingertips. Poor baby. This must be so frustrating for you. She researched online for hours, constantly offering solutions. I think it might be stress related, or maybe you're allergic to something new. She bought me special face wash, expensive serums, even booked me an appointment with her dermatologist. The doctor was completely baffled. My hormone levels were normal. No underlying health condition. Sometimes these things just happen. She said. With a shrug, let's try some topical treatments. Nothing worked. If anything, my skin kept getting worse. I looked like a pepperoni pizza. Deep red welts covered my cheeks and jawline. My confidence was completely destroyed. I stopped hanging out with friends, barely wanted to leave the apartment. Even wearing a mask felt pointless because people could still see the inflammation around my eyes. Bianca was my rock through everything. She never made me feel ugly or self conscious. You're still handsome to me, she'd whisper, kissing my forehead gently. We'll figure this out together, I promise. She suggested I start using some of her product.

So I exposed the truth about him. I found out yesterday when his iPad auto synced to the family computer. There it was in his Venmo history. Monthly payments to RM labeled lunch money every first of the month. Like clockwork, the amount matched exactly what my brother once drunkenly admitted. His apartment costs $4,000 per month. My stomach dropped. When ARAM moved to New York after college, my parents threw him a goodbye party. So proud of you for making it on your own, my dad had said. Raising his beer, that's what real men do. He'd looked directly at me when he said it. I was living in their basement, then rebuilding my career. After my online business collapsed. Dad had made it a big deal charging me 700 dollar rent. You're so ungrateful. I'm doing you a favor, he'd announced at dinner. You need to learn responsibility and be like your brother. So I paid every month while freelancing during the day and building my new business on weekends. Five hours if I was lucky. Meanwhile, Aaron was posting Instagram Stories from rooftop bars and weekend trips to the Hamptons. Your brother's just better with money, mom would say when I'd question his lifestyle. He got that finance job while you're doing nothing but being on your computer. And that finance job? Entry level at A no name firm. His apartment alone would devour most of his salary. But I believed the lie because the alternative, that my parents were lying to my face, was unbearable. The Venmo history went back three years. Some payments had notes that made me sick. Lunch money plus vacation, lunch money plus new wardrobe. All while I was buying groceries at the dollar store. I kept scrolling, my hands trembling. Now I found a synced email to their accountant that stopped me cold. Can we claim both kids as dependents? RM for support and daughter for disability? Disability? They told their accountant I was disabled. Not struggling, not rebuilding disabled. While I was working 60 hour weeks in their basement, they were writing

I was already emotional after having to shave one of my clients heads because she had just gone through her first round of chemo. I wiped away my tears as the door chimed, but then I felt my whole body freeze up when I realized who had just walked inside. My ex boyfriend, Kai walked in with some blonde girl hanging off his arm like a trophy. My hands started shaking as I gripped my clippers because this was the same guy who'd spent eight months ridiculing my red hair. He'd call me Wendy's mascot or fire crotch pretty much every chance he'd get to his boys behind my back. He didn't stop at anything. Every time he'd use the same pathetic excuse, even for a man who'd made an entire group chat dedicated to roasting gingers. The worst part of it all was when I overheard his new girlfriend talking about dying her hair red of all colours. I watched Kai's face scrunch up and disgust as he heard it, before he said the words that made my blood truly boil. Are you insane? Red hair is literally the worst feature a girl can have. Trust me, I know. He said it loud enough for the whole shop to hear, and then he actually kept going. I dated this redhead chick for way too long, and it Was so embarrassing. Like walking around with a human hot Cheeto. Plus, they're all psycho, every single one of them. All this happened while I was standing 10 feet away, and he had no idea. The girl at the next station literally stopped cutting halfway through to stare at him. Also in pure disbelief. Everyone in there picked up their phones, not making it obvious. As we started texting, the shop group chat exploded with messages like, is he serious right now? And bro is about to get karma. While all the girls started telepathically coming up with our plan. We immediately put down her clippers and walked over to his girlfriend. Girl, I'm sorry, but I overheard your idea, and I have to show you something. She pulled out her iPad.

When I was 15. I was walking home from school when a car pulled up next to me. A woman rolled down her window and said she worked with my mom. She told me there was a family emergency, and my mom asked her to pick me up. Something felt wrong immediately. Her smile was too wide, her eyes too focused on my backpack, not my face. I'd never seen this woman before. No uniform, no ID badge, nothing that proved she knew my mom. But she knew my name. And that my mom worked at Memorial Hospital. My heart started racing, but I tried to stay calm. Oh, that's weird. My mom just texted me five minutes ago and didn't mention anything. I lied, patting my pocket where my phone was. The woman's smile tightened. Well, it just happened. Your mom's really worried. Just get in and I'll explain everything. Instead of walking closer, I took step back. Actually, I need to make a quick call first. What did you say your name was again? Her eyes darted to the empty street around us. There was nobody else walking, no cars passing by. Just me and her. There's no time for that. Your mom said to hurry. Her voice got harder as she reached across to push open the passenger door. Get in now! That's when I remembered the safety app my dad installed on my phone last month. It a panic that would immediately alert my parents and the police of my location. Okay, let me just grab something from my backpack real quick, I said, trying to keep my voice steady while slowly backing away. I turned slightly, unzipping my bag while keeping my eyes on her. I slipped my hand into my pocket, unlocked my phone by feel, and press the panic button three times. The woman was getting impatient. She started to get out of the car. I don't have all day, kid. Just then, a neighbor's door opened down the street. Missus Reynolds stepped out to get her mail. I've never been so happy to see our nosy neighbor in my life, Missus Reynolds

Every Christmas morning, he'd give my siblings expensive gifts while telling me real children get presents, not strays we picked up. When I cried, he'd say, your real parents didn't want you. Why would we? Mom would just look away and change the subject. He made me call him sir, while my siblings called him dad. I had to eat dinner after everyone else finished because family eats first. My siblings never questioned it. They got allowances. I got chores. They got birthday parties. I got a cupcake if I was lucky. Dad would tell extended family I was troubled and that's why I seem different. I believed every word. At school, I was too ashamed to invite friends over. How do you explain that your own father treats you like hired help? Teachers noticed I was withdrawn, but when they called home, dad would charm them completely. Oh, she's just shy. A adopted children sometimes struggle with attachment. The worst part was how systematic it was. He'd praise my siblings constantly while finding fault in everything I did. Why can't you be more like your brother? Became his daily mantra. I spent years thinking something was fundamentally wrong with me. He even had fake adoption papers. I found them in his desk when I Was 12, looking for tape. They looked official to my young eyes, complete with org signatures and a made up agency name. When I asked mom about them, she started crying and locked herself in the bathroom for an hour. At 16, I needed my birth certificate for a job application. Dad said I'd have to contact social services since I wasn't really family. But when I went to the courthouse myself, something didn't add up.

The first thing I noticed when I entered the patient's room was her deep, sunken eyes and pale, cracked lips. I approached her cautiously, remembering how the charge nurse warned the girl refused all male staff. We all knew what that meant, and she looked as broken as I imagined. I pulled up a chair next to her bed instead of standing over her, and gently asked if she wanted some water first. She nodded. Sweetie, you're safe here, I said, keeping my voice soft like I do with my anxious patients. Male staff won't come near you, I promise. It's just us girls here. She looked at me for the first time and whispered, he's here. I asked who, and at first she refused to even say his name. I handed her my pen and clipboard. After a second, her hand moved. Percy. My blood boiled at the name. He was my everything, she finally whispered and started showing me photos on her phone of them together at college, confirming that it was the same Percy who was now a resident at the hospital. I did everything for him. Everything. Her voice cracked as she swiped to screenshots of assignments, time stamps showing her submitting his biochemistry homework at 3:00am, his pathology essays at 4:00am, his anatomy exams that she taken for him. She showed me his Instagram from those same nights doing beer pongs and Body shots with other girls while she was writing his thesis on cellular biology. The day after graduation, after I'd spent three years making sure he got into residency, he sent me this, she said, and handed me her phone. The text made me want to throw something. Babe, you're too clingy, and it's honestly suffocating. Need to focus on my career without distractions. And honestly, doctors are supposed to date doctors, and you're not one. We're done. Please don't contact me again. I waited until she was stable and sleeping before I stormed into the break room where three other nurses were charting. You guys are never going to believe what I just found out about Percy. I said. I told them everything and watched their faces go from confused to furious. And within 10 minutes, we had half the female staff crammed into that tiny break room. I knew something was off when he asked me to explain what antibiotics were. Said June from pediatrics and Doctor Sydney are attending walked in right as someone said we should report him. And she closed the door behind her. Actually

I run a boutique skincare business from my home studio, creating custom serums for clients with sensitive skin conditions. Each formula is specifically tailored. Some need snail solution filtrate from Korea, others require bakuchiol oil from India, and the really complex cases get peptide complexes that literally cost more per ounce than actual gold. A thing. Full custom batch runs me about $200 in raw ingredients, but I charge $400 because the results are incredible. My sister in law, Kayla, moved in with us three weeks before her wedding. She's always been jealous of literally everything I have my house, my business, even my husband's attention. She kept complaining about stress breakouts appearing on her face, dramatically sighing in front of mirrors, and asking if I had anything professional grade that could help her look perfect for the big day. I offered her some basic drugstore products, gentle cleansers, hydrating serums. Nothing too intense, but she kept hovering around my workstation asking detailed questions about my expensive ingredients. She'd pick up bottles, read labels, ask about prices. I caught her photographing my formula notebooks multiple times. The week before the wedding, I started working on a rush order for my most important client, a local news anchor who pays premium for custom anti aging serums. This particular formula required $300 worth of rare peptides, growth factors, and botanical Extracts. I spent two days perfecting the mixture, testing P H. Levels, ensuring stability. The morning of Kayla's wedding, I woke up early to package the completed serum for Monday pickup. Walked into my lab, set up, and immediately felt something was wrong. My bakuchiol dropper was sitting in the wrong spot. The snail mucin jar had clear fingerprints on the glass. My peptide vials were slightly out of order. I did a complete ingredient inventory.

It was like they grew up in separate houses. Amy had a long list of chores. Had to cook dinner twice a week, do her own laundry, and keep her room spotless. She had a ten PM curfew, even on weekends. And we expected her to get good grades, which she did. She was a straight A student. Leo, on the other hand, his only chore was to take out the trash, and he usually forgot. He didn't have a curfew.

My son's third grade teacher confiscated his life saving medical snacks because they contained sugar. So I went to the local farmers market and destroyed her career with a dozen cupcakes. My eight year old son, Leo, has type 1 diabetes. If his blood sugar drops too low, he needs a juice box or fruit snacks immediately. It's not a suggestion, it's a medical necessity to prevent a seizure or coma. We had a doctor's note and a detailed plan we gave to all his teachers. But this year he got missus Davison. She was famous in the district for her strict, healthy classroom policy. She send notes home scolding parents for packing things like goldfish crackers, calling them processed poison. In her mind, the only acceptable snack was an organic fruit or vegetable. At our first meeting, I explained Leo's diabetes and showed her his emergency kit, which was clearly labeled. She looked at the juice boxes and fruit snacks with disgust. I'm sorry, but we have a no sugar policy in this classroom, she said. A medical condition is not an excuse to break the rules. An apple will work just fine. I tried to explain that an apple sugar acts too slowly during a critical low. She cut me off. I've been a teacher for 20 years. I know what's best for children. The next day, she confiscated his emergency kit. Two weeks later, I got the call I've been dreading. Leo had a severe low sugar episode during math class. Missus Davidson gave him a few apple slices. His numbers kept dropping. He was pale and shaking. By the time the school nurse arrived with his emergency kit, he was barely conscious. When I met with the principal, he backed her up, saying the school supported a teacher's discretion in maintaining classroom health standards. That Saturday, I was at the local farmers market. I noticed a very popular baking stand called Debbie's Delights. They

My parents got divorced when I was 15, and it was messy as hell. Mom moved out and dad kept the house. At first, everything seemed normal. My room stayed exactly how I left it. Band posters on the walls, my gaming setup in the corner, clothes scattered everywhere like a tornado hit it. Dad was actually trying to be the cool parent at first. He'd order pizza for dinner three nights in a row and let me stay up as late as I wanted. I thought maybe the divorce wouldn't be so bad after all. Then about six months later, dad started dating this woman named Crystal. Yeah, I know. The name should have been a red flag. He was one of those people who smile too much and try way too hard to be your friend. Every time she came over, she'd be like, hey, kiddo, how's school? In this fake, cheerful voice that made my skin crawl. Crystal had this annoying habit of rearranging stuff in our house. He moved the coffee maker to a different counter and claim it had better feng Shui or whatever. She switched out Dad's beer for some organic kombucha crap that tasted like dirt. But I figured it was just typical new girlfriend behavior. The real problem started when Crystal moved in permanently. Dad didn't even ask me how I felt about it. One day, I Came home from school, and half her junk was already in the living room. Boxes of scented candles, throw pillows with inspirational quotes, and this weird crystal collection that she claimed had healing powers. But here's where it gets really messed up. Crystal worked from home, doing some kind of online consulting thing. She kept complaining that she needed a proper office space with good lighting and privacy for her. Zoom calls. Our house only had 3 bedrooms. Dad's room, my room, and this tiny guest room that was basically a closet with a window. I was at Mom's house for the weekend when it happened. When I came back Sunday night, I walked upstairs to my room and almost had a heart attack. My door was wide open, and everything was completely different. My bed was

My roommate Ben, was obsessed with this Instagram model named Grace who worked at our local coffee shop. For three months, he'd go there daily, order expensive drinks, and stare at her like a creep. He'd practiced conversations in our dorm mirror, but never spoke to her beyond medium latte, please. It was honestly painful to watch. This dude was spending his entire food budget on overpriced coffee just to be in the same room as this girl who probably didn't even know his name. One day, Ben discovered Grace was best friends with this bigger girl named Megan, who also worked there. Ben came running back with his brilliant plan. Bro, you need to ask Megan out, he said, pacing our tiny room like a maniac. If you date her friend, I'll have an automatic in with Grace. Girl code, wingman duties. Double dates. It's perfect. I stared at him like he'd lost his mind. Dude, that's messed up. I'm not using some random girl just so you can get a date. But Ben reminded me he'd been helping me pass calculus all semester. Without his tutoring, I'd probably fail and lose my scholarship. He also offered to cover utilities for two months. I felt absolutely terrible, but I was broke and desperate. The next day, I walked into that coffee shop with my stomach in knots. Megan was working the register, and when she saw me approach, She smiled this genuine, warm smile that immediately made me feel like garbage about what I was doing. Hey, you're Ben's friend, right? She said, already starting to make my usual order. I'm Megan. I've actually noticed you guys coming in here a lot. My heart sank. She been paying attention to me. And here I was, about to manipulate her feelings for my roommate's benefit. But I was already committed. So I took a deep breath and asked, would you maybe wanna grab dinner sometime? Just the two of us? Her entire face lit up like Christmas morning. Really? I mean, yes, I'd love that. I was actually hoping you'd ask. We exchanged numbers, and I scheduled our date for that Friday night. I plan to suffer through one awkward dinner, get some Intel about Grace for Ben.

I came home to find him standing in the kitchen with this proud smile on his face. He just solved world hunger. He goes, babe, I did all your laundry today. Even folded everything and put it away. I thanked him and went to check my dresser. That's when I noticed something was off. My sock drawer looked weird. All my socks were there, but they looked different. Faded, shrunken. Some of them had these weird fuzzy bits all over them. I grabbed a pair of my favourite black ankle socks, the ones I bought from target for 12 bucks that fit perfectly and never slipped down in my shoes. They were now the size of toddler socks and felt like sandpaper. Jake! I called out, holding up the tiny sock, what did you do? He walked over, looking confused. I washed them with hot water to make sure they got really clean. Hot water on cotton socks? I felt my eye twitch. These are ruined, I said, showing him the drawer. All of them? They're either too small or they feel like steel wool. He shrugged. They still work as socks. That's when I lost it. These Weren't just any socks. I'm super picky about socks. I hate when they bunch up, slide down, or feel rough. I'd spent months finding the perfect ones that didn't make me wanna rip my shoes off by noon. No, they don't work as socks. I said. Look at this. I tried putting on a pair of my favorite gray ones. They barely covered my heels and squeeze my toes like a tourniquet. Jake rolled his eyes. You're being dramatic. They're just socks. Just socks.

Turns out my mom's been lying about something huge for 18 years. Last month, my dad got one of those Ancestry DNA kits as a Joe birthday gift from my aunt. She thought it would be fun for him to trace our family tree, maybe find some distant cousins or something. Cool. When his results came back, he called me into his office looking like he'd seen a ghost. According to this, you can't be my biological son. My world stopped. He'd always been my hero. The guy who taught me to throw a football in the backyard every weekend, helped with calculus homework every night at the kitchen table. Promised since I was little he'd pay for any college I wanted. I'd already committed to an expensive out of state engineering program at Georgia Tech because as of that promise, we'd even toured the campus together last spring and bought me a hoodie. Mom completely broke down when he confronted her. Through tears and hyperventilating, she admitted she'd had an affair with his best friend Jason, right around the time I was conceived. She genuinely didn't know who my father was, and I've been living with that secret my entire life. She said she thought about getting a paternity test when I was born, but chickened out every time.

Helped coach my Little League team. Taught me how to change a tire. When I turned 16. He used to joke that I was more like his kid than his own son. I have no way to get answers from him now. Dad looked me dead in the eye, his voice shaking with anger and hurt, and said, I need proof you're mine, or I can't justify spending $200,000 on someone else's kid.

My little sister Nora always got the lead in every school day, ever since she was 8. She'd belt out songs from Hamilton in our living room while I sat there clapping. I told myself I was proud of her, but deep down, I was seething with jealousy. When auditions for our high school spring musical came around, we both tried out for the same part. Maria and West Side Story. She was a sophomore with natural talent. I was a senior who'd taken voice lessons for three years. And this was literally my last shot at high school theater. At the first audition, Nora sang somewhere and got a standing ovation from the other kids waiting. I went after her and could barely hit the high notes. Director smiled lightly and said, thank you. Two days later, the callback list went up. Both our names were there, but I knew Nora had already won. That night at dinner, she was practically bouncing in her chair. I can't believe we both made callbacks. This is so cool! We could be in the show together! Mom beamed my two theater stars. I smiled and nodded, but inside, I was planning something terrible. The night before callbacks, I snuck into Nora's room while she was showering. I knew she had a severe shellfish allergy. We'd been to the ER twice because I found her favorite strawberry lip balm, The one she always used before singing. I crushed up some of the shrimp crackers from our pantry and mixed the powder into the lip balm. Not enough to kill her or anything, just enough to make her lips swell up so she couldn't hit the notes. I felt sick doing it, but I convinced myself it was just leveling the playing field. The next morning, Nora woke up looking like she and stung by a dozen bees. Her lips were so swollen she could barely talk. Mom, she tried to say, but it came out garbled. Mom freaked out and rushed her to urgent care, while I got ready for school, texting my friends about how worried I was about my poor sister. At callbacks, I was the only Maria left.

My twin brother Felix got engaged six months ago to his girlfriend Julia of three years. We've always been incredibly close. Not identical twins, but people constantly mix us up. We did everything together growing up, went to different colleges, but talked daily, and I was genuinely excited when he found someone who made him happy. When he told me about the engagement over dinner at our favorite restaurant, I congratulated him and jokingly asked when I should start planning his bachelor party as his obvious choice for best man. He just laughed it off and said we'll see how things go. A month later, I brought up wedding party plans more seriously during one of our weekly coffee meet UPS. He seemed uncomfortable and said they were keeping it really small and would let me know once they figured everything out. I didn't push it because I know wedding planning can be incredible, incredibly stressful, and overwhelming. Three weeks ago, I was scrolling Instagram during my lunch break and saw photos from what clearly looked like his bachelor party, Felix and about eight guys I didn't recognize at some trendy brewery downtown. I wasn't in any photos and definitely hadn't been invited.

So my husband thought it would be hilarious to use our family's Elf on the shelf named jingle to play pranks on me. For weeks I been moving the stupid elf around the house every night after the kids went to bed, trying to keep the Christmas magic alive for Emma, who's 6, and Noah, who's 4. Tyler knew I was exhausted. I work 12 hour shifts at the hospital and still come home to cook dinner, help with homework, and do the whole mom thing. But every morning when the kids would wake up excited to see where jingle moved, Tyler would make these little comments like wow, must be nice to have time for crafts or some of us have real jobs. The breaking point came last Tuesday. I had worked a double shift and dragged myself home at 2:00am. I completely forgot to move the damn elf. When Emma woke up and saw jingle in the same spot as yesterday, she started crying because she thought she'd been bad and Santa was mad at her. I felt like garbage, so I quickly made up some story about how jingle was just extra tired and needed to rest. Emma seemed to buy it, but I could see Tyler smirking at me from the kitchen. That night. I made sure to move jingle to the bathroom counter with some toilet Paper making it look like he was using the bathroom. The kids thought it was hilarious the next morning, but when I got home from work, Tyler had moved the elf to our bedroom and positioned it on my pillow with a note that said, Emma's mom needs to step up her game. I was pissed, but didn't want to start a fight in front of the kids. I moved jingle back to the living room that night, thinking Tyler would drop it wrong. The next morning, Emma came running into our room sobbing. She said jingle was being mean and there was something scary in his hands. I ran to the living room and found the elf holding a printed photo of me sleeping with my mouth open and drool on my face. Tyler had taken the picture the night before and thought it would be funny to have the

You're fired. I left quietly without making a scene, then told my husband to just smiled. Four hours later, panic broke out. 98 missed calls. I've been the head chef at Romano's for three years. When I started, it was a struggling family restaurant with two star reviews and empty tables. I transformed everything, rebuilt the menu, trained the staff, sourced local ingredients. Within a year, we were booked solid with a waiting list. But when old Mister Romano died last spring, everything changed. His son Giovanni inherited the place, and he had different ideas. Cut costs, use frozen ingredients. Fire half the kitchen staff. People can't tell the difference anyway, he'd say, counting receipts. While I fought to maintain the standards that built our reputation, I refused to compromise. Our lamb, also buco, was legendary. Our house made pasta brought people from three states over. I wasn't about to ruin that for Giovanni's profit margins. So on my 32nd birthday, after our biggest week ever, he called me into the cramped office above the dining room. Birthday balloons from the staff still hung in the kitchen below. Here's my surprise for you, he said with this smug grin. You're fired, effective immediately. You're too difficult to work with. I stood there, soft stained apron still tied around my waist, watching him lean back in his father's old chair like he just Solved world hunger. I didn't argue, didn't cry. Just untied my apron, set it on his desk, and walked out past the confused prep cooks who'd worked under me for years. The drive home felt endless. Three years of my life gone. My reputation, my team, my recipes, all handed over to someone who thought ketchup was a vegetable. My husband Scott, was waiting in our kitchen with a bottle of wine and that knowing smile he gets when he's up to something. How did the birthday shift go? He asked, already pouring two glasses. Terrible. Giovanni

She has twin 12 year olds from her first marriage, Charlotte and Aiden. Their dad sends birthday cards twice a year if we're lucky. Last Tuesday, I caught Charlotte stealing 20 bucks from Samantha's purse. When I confronted her, she rolled her eyes and said, you're not my real dad. You can't tell me what to do. I calmly told Samantha what happened. Instead of addressing the theft, she got defensive. Don't lecture my kids about money. If you want a parent so badly, get your own children. That's done. But I just smiled and said, alright. See, what Samantha didn't know was that I've been covering their car insurance, phone bills, and school supplies for months. While she struggled with debt, I'd also been quietly setting aside college funds for both kids, $400 a month each, into savings accounts they didn't even know existed. The next morning, I canceled everything. Car insurance gone. Phone plan terminated. The college accounts I'd opened, closed, and transferred to my personal savings. I also stopped buying groceries. No more weekly 200 dollar trips to keep pantry stocked. No more paying for their Netflix, Spotify, or Charlotte's dance classes that cost me $150 a month. Aiden soccer registration fees not my problem anymore. I even canceled the family gym membership and Stopped paying for their school lunches. Every subscribe, every monthly payment, every little expense I've been quietly handling. All of it gone. When Charlotte's phone got shut off at school and she couldn't call her friends, she came home furious. Why isn't my phone working? Ask your mom, I said, not looking up from my laptop. Aiden couldn't get picked up from soccer practice because the car insurance had lapsed and Samantha's registration was expired. She had to leave work early, costing her overtime.

Hey, so I'm moving in with Blake next month. But don't. Don't worry. I'll still pay rent until our lease ends in March. I thought that was actually pretty responsible of her. We've been roommates for two years, never had major drama. I figured we'd coast through the final months drama Free. Boy, was I wrong. The very next night, Blake shows up with a duffel bag. And he never left. Suddenly, my quiet apartment turned into their little love nest. Blake's using my Netflix account, rating my leftovers, leaving his sweaty gym clothes on my couch. His gaming setup appeared in the living room. His toothbrush showed up next to mine. Dude basically moved in without paying a single dollar. When I brought it up to Kayla, she just shrugged. What's the big deal? I'm still paying my half of rent. He's just staying over. Staying over for three weeks straight, apparently. That's when it hit me.

It started when some seniors decided to pull a prank involving our school's ancient fire alarm system. They'd noticed that during fire drills, only half the alarms actually worked. And teachers just told us to follow the crowd instead of following proper evacuation routes. So they came up with this plan. They'd trigger a fake fire alarm during lunch and then hide in the bathroom to see how long it took administration to figure out there was no actual emergency. Just stupid prank to waste everyone's time for 10 minutes. But when they pulled the alarm, something went seriously wrong. The main fire doors, the ones that are supposed to automatically open during emergencies, didn't budge. Kids were pushing against them, but they were completely locked. Backup exits were chained shut from the outside because administration didn't want students leaving campus during school hours. What was supposed to be a harmless prank turned into 800 students trapped in a building with no way out. Students started panicking. The alarms were blaring, but nobody could get through the exits. Teachers were yelling contradictory instructions. Some kids were having full panic attacks, thinking there was a real fire. It took 20 minutes for a janitor to find the manual override keys and unlock the doors. Twenty minutes of chaos, with kids genuinely scared they were going to die in a fire drill. Our principal was furious about the prank, but he Was more concerned about covering up the safety violations. He suspended the seniors and tried to spin the story as students interfering with emergency procedures. But parents started asking questions. Why were the fire doors locked? Why did it take so long to evacuate the building? The seniors who did the prank hired a lawyer because they were facing criminal charges for endangering public safety.

When my son was 11, his school bus crashed. The impact whipped his neck so violently that it crushed his airway. The doctors told us he would recover, but warned that he might never be able to speak again. It felt like a piece of him had been taken. He never let it stop him from trying to stay present, especially with his little sister, Rosie. She was five at the time, full of energy, always talking about everything and anything. And even though Nathan couldn't respond with words, he would still listen to every story she told. He'd smile, nod, or type little messages back to her on his phone. Most of the time, that was enough for her. But one afternoon, Rosie came home from school clearly upset. Her eyes were puffy, and she didn't say a word until she ran straight into Nathan's room. She dropped her backpack and hugged him tightly, tears rolling down her cheek. Nathan rubbed her back gently, trying his best to comfort her. She held on to him for a long time and then whispered, I just wish you could tell me it'll be okay. Nathan froze for a second. I saw it from the hallway. The look on his face broke me. He couldn't say what he wanted to say, and Rosie quietly left the room a few minutes later. After that day, Nathan started spending more Time alone. He would come home from school, eat dinner, and then disappear into his room. Every time I peeked in to check on him, he was already under the blanket. I figured maybe soccer practice was wearing him out or school was getting tougher, and I didn't want to push him to talk about it. I just let him rest. Then came Rosie's seventh birthday. The house was packed with cousins, neighbors, friends from school. There were balloons everywhere and a giant pink cake with seven candles sitting on the table. When it was time to sing, Rosie leaned forward and made her wish. She closed her eyes, smiled, and blew out every single candle in one breath. Everyone clapped, and then Nathan raised his hand. The room went completely silent. At first I thought something was wrong. He usually only did that when he needed help or something hurt. But this time his face was calm. Focus. He took a deep breath. His cheeks flushed.

The problem? Every single one of his triggers was connected to me. My laugh, my footsteps, the way I chewed food, the sound of me turning pages when I read. Even the way I breathe sometimes would set him off. I remember being six years old, sitting in the backseat of our car, and I laughed at something I saw outside the window. Jake immediately started having a meltdown, covering his ears, yell, hitting himself. My dad pulled over and screamed at me. For being selfish and not thinking about your brother's condition. That's when the rules started. I wasn't allowed to eat dinner with the family anymore. My parents would have dinner with Jake, and when he was finished and had left the table, then I could come out of my room and eat by myself. Cold Food alone while my parents cleaned up, or watch TV. I couldn't go on family outings if Jake was coming, which was basically all of them. Movie theaters, restaurants, amusement parks. Anywhere that my normal kid sounds might bother him was off limits for me. At home, I had to walk on my tiptoes. I couldn't watch TV in the living room if Jake was around.

Maybe in another year. No, she cut me off. My family's Christmas Eve party is in two weeks. I want you to propose to me there, in front of everyone. If you can't do that, we're done. A public proposal ultimatum felt like a hostage negotiation. I tried reasoning with her, but she wouldn't budge. It was the party or it was over. Three days later, her older sister Sarah asked me to meet for coffee, her voice tense over the phone. Sarah was Laura's opposite. Quiet, pragmatic, worked as a real estate agent. When I got there, she looked like she hadn't slept. She'd overheard Laura in Her old bedroom, talking to her best friend, Megan. Laura was laughing, bragging about the ultimatum. Sarah said she's been seeing someone else for a month. Her plan is to let you propose publicly. So she can say no and humiliate you in front of everyone. It would be her grand exit. Dramatic story she could tell for years. Megan was squealing with delight, promising to film your rejection. Sarah looked directly at me. She wants to ruin you just for a story. I couldn't let that happen. Something Chris

I think she just confessed to mass murder. When I met my girlfriend Haley, everything in my life happened way too fast, because within just two weeks, I was practically living at her place. But it didn't matter to me. She let me eat her out whenever I wanted to, was super beautiful, and even made me feel like I was the only guy on earth who truly mattered. I felt like I was on heaven until the 23rd night into us living together, because when I was just mindlessly scrolling on TikTok while I was next to her in bed, she suddenly rolled over to me and just stared at me without an expression. Ask me a question, she whispered, but I immediately realized something was wrong because her voice sounded completely flat and robotic. I nervously laughed, thinking it was a joke, but she didn't. Instead, she just grabbed my hand and yelled, ask me! So I gave in and asked, do you like it when I stick it in? Yes, I love it, she replied. Then she just turned around like nothing happened. The next morning, she looked like she had completely forgotten what happened. So when I showed her the massive wound she left on my hand, she completely freaked out and apologized a million times. I tried to forget it because I loved her too much. But the very next night, she did it again. Asked me a question. She asked again. This time I asked her, would you ever cheat on me? She just looked at me and said, no, daddy, and turned around to sleep. Every single night after that, the exact same creepy routine happened. One question, one answer, then sleep. Until one night I got super annoyed and asked what happens if I don't ask anything? She just stared at me and said, you die. Then, just like every other day, she turned around and slept. The next day, I was still horrified with what she said, so I texted her that I had to take care of my sick mom and just went to sleep at my house. But in the middle of the night, at 3:00am, she broke into my house, shook me awake, and violently told me to ask her a question. I just couldn't go on living like this, so I refused. And the second I said that, she immediately dug her nails into my skin so deep that I started bleeding. I had no idea what to do, so I asked her, when do I die? But this time she just said after me and dropped asleep on the floor. That night, I packed everything in my car, drove to the other side of the country.

She just posted something horrifying on her Instagram story. Last time I saw her, she was screaming at my mom in the driveway, told us that she was done with all of us, and then stormed off into the night. We assumed she'd be back in a couple of hours, but after 10 hours with no sign of her, we knew something was awfully wrong. At first, the cops thought it was just a dramatic teenage runaway case. When they found her phone three hours later in the middle of the woods, their tone completely changed. There were no footprints, no fingerprint, and not even a sign of where she could have gone. The cops told us that she died in a river and that it was best to just move on from her. My mom started sleeping in Aubrey's bed. My dad put locks on every door and window, and I spent every night putting missing posters around town. That was 5 years ago, and I accepted the fact that she was never coming back. But last night, while I was watching some corn, a notification popped up on my phone. Yobrey Duris just added to their story. I was super confused how that was even possible, because her account was deactivated the week she vanished. I assumed her account had just gotten hacked or something. When I clicked on her story, it showed a blurry photo of Aubrey in some disgusting Bathroom. She had the same jawline, same mole under her eye, and even the same freckles, but her skin looked kind of grayish, almost like she hadn't seen sunlight in years. And her mouth was stretched into this weird smile, like she was forcing it or something. She also put a caption on it which said, see you soon, Danny. But before I could even process what was going on, my phone started buzzing with DMs from random accounts. They were saying things like, bro, is this a joke? Why is she back? Check the next story. So I tapped back on her profile and saw that it was fully active again. Her old photos were completely restored, but all the captions were changed. All kept saying things like, he feeds through me. Danny's next. I hear him breathing. But it was the pictures that shook me the most. Each one had a shadowy figure somewhere in the background, standing behind trees, peeking from hallways, or even sitting at our dinner table in one of them. And just when I thought I saw it all, she uploaded a real called home. It was a video.

We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer, where I was supposed to be her plus one. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends. We get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends. But not amazing partners. Here's what killed me. She said all this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay. You've already got an exit strategy? I said, we're adults. We're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies? Okay. I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. I treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7:00am. Could you drop off my work laptop? Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans. Monday works better. She didn't like that. But what was she going to say? We're just friends now. Week two, Tara started cracking. She showed up at the apartment while I was at work. Still using her key. Helped herself to groceries, did laundry, took a shower. I texted her. I'll need the key back. My friends don't have keys to my place. This is ridiculous. We live together. We used to live together.

Luna's friend group called themselves the coven unironically. Five women who'd known each other since college, pleat with matching tattoos. The ring leader was Scarlet, a marketing director who began every sentence with actually. Then there was Iris, a fashion blogger who looked at my target jeans like they personally offended her. Zara, a yoga instructor who kept mentioning my blocked chakras. Natasha, a lawyer who interrogated me like I was on trial. And Ava, the only decent one who at least looked uncomfortable. I already finished a bottle of wine before I arrived, and the humiliation started immediately. So you work in IT, Scarlet said with that condescending tone. How practical. Not very creative, though, is it? When I mentioned gaming as a hobby, Zara laughed. Gaming? Isn't that for teenagers? I dated a gamer once. He chose his PlayStation over couple's therapy. Red flag. Honestly, every answer got picked up. When I said I hoped Luna and I would be engaged in five years, Iris scoffed, maybe after five years, Luna needs someone. Who knows? Not maybe. Then came the ex boyfriend comparisons. Luna's ex, Miguel, was so Romantic! Zara said, looking directly at me. Remember when he flew her to Paris for a weekend? I bet Theo is more of a staycation guy. Miguel was intense, though, too jealous, Scarlett added. At least he had passion. Some guys are just vanilla. They all stared at me while Luna said absolutely nothing. When I finally stood up for air, Scarlett smirked. Oh, did we hit a nerve? Luna, your boy is sensitive.

Teachers would apologize and tell you to share with someone else. During my junior year AP Calculus exam, I grabbed calculator No.. 23, which was notorious for freezing during tests. Sure enough, 10 minutes in, it completely died. Black screen, nothing. I was panicking because this test was 40% of our grade. So in desperation, I started whispering to the calculator like it was a pet or something. Come on, buddy, I said quietly. Wake up. We need to do some derivatives together. Nothing. Getting more frustrated, I tried what I thought sounded like computer commands. Enable calculation mode. Only the screen flickered and came back to life. Perfect timing. The girl next to me saw the whole thing. Oh, my god, how did you do that? I just talked to it, I whispered back, confused. After the test, she told everyone that I had special calculator powers and could fix broken ones by talking to them. I tried to explain it was just a coincidence, but nobody listened.

She went back to college, started dating, seemed really grateful for getting her life back. But then things started going downhill. Chloe began skipping doctor appointments because they were too much stress. Started drinking at parties, even though alcohol was totally off limits with her meds. When I'd say something, she'd flip out and say I was trying to run her life. I'm not gonna live like some sick person forever, she'd say, I wanna actually enjoy being young.

From your $7, $2 needs to go toward rent for your bedroom. After all, you do live here and use electricity and heat every day. That's not fair! She protested, but he kept going. One dollar goes toward utilities since you keep the lights on in your room and use our water for baths. And since you wanted to get paid for feeding whiskers, $1 needs to cover the cost of cat food and vet bills. Sophie watched in horror as her fortune dwindled down to three measly dollars. Her face turned bright red and she slammed her tiny fists on the table. This is highway robbery! I'm poor now! She spent the next 10 minutes ranting about unfair taxes and how adults were trying to steal her hard earned money. Finally, she declared that she was going on strike and stomped upstairs to her room, slamming the door behind her. The rebellion lasted exactly until dinner time, when whiskers started meowing for food. Sophie tried to ignore it, but our cat kept following her around the house, rubbing against her legs, and crying. She lasted about 20 minutes before quietly going to the kitchen, filling the food bowl, and whispering to whiskers that she was sorry. The next morning she came downstairs and announced she was willing to go back to the old system. No more contracts, no more payment demands, just regular Chores like before

The same night, he texted me asking for grocery money. I stared at my phone for 20 minutes watching those stories over and over. The math wasn't mathing. That weekend, Kevin showed up at my door with laundry bags and his usual sob story. His roommate had kicked him out. He had nowhere to go. Just needed to crash for a few days until he got back on his feet. I looked at his face, saw the same expression he'd had since we were kids when he wanted something, and felt something snap inside me. No, I said. He laughed like I was joking. What do you mean, no? I mean no. Figure it out yourself. His face went from confused to angry real quick. Started yelling about how I was abandoning him, how family was supposed to help family, how I was being selfish. He called me a terrible sister and said mom would be disappointed in me. I closed the door while he was still talking. For 3 weeks, I heard nothing. Mom called twice, asking if I knew where Kevin was staying. I told her to ask him. She got quiet and said she was worried about him, that maybe I should check in. I said no to that, too. Then my coworker Emma mentioned seeing someone who looked like my brother working at the warehouse where her boyfriend worked night shifts loading trucks. I didn't Say anything. But I felt weird about it for days. Kevin finally called me a month later. Not to ask for money, but to tell me he'd gotten his own apartment. A tiny studio, but it was his. He'd saved up the deposit working doubles at the warehouse. His voice sounded different.

I used to be the family's emergency contact for everything. My little brother Kevin was 24 and still calling me at midnight because he'd spent his rent money on whatever caught his attention that week. Last time it was a drone he was going to use to start a photography business. Before that, a gaming chair that cost more than most people's car payments. Every month, same story. He'd blow through his paycheck in the first week, then show up at my apartment with his sorry eyes and empty wallet. I'd transfer him money while he promised this was the last time wearing he'd figured out his budget, had a plan. Whatever lie sounded good in the moment. Our parents had been doing this dance with Kevin since high school. Mom would slip him 20s when dad wasn't looking. Dad would lend him gas money that everyone knew wasn't coming back. When they finally got tired of it, guess who became the backup bank? The breaking point came on a Tuesday. I was at work when Kevin called panicking because his car was about to get repossessed. He needed $800 by five PM or he'd lose his way to get to his delivery job. I was in the middle of a presentation when my phone kept buzzing with text like, please, Claire, I'm literally shaking and I'll pay you back next Friday. I swear. I excused myself from the meeting, drove To the bank and wired him the money. My boss asked if everything was okay. When I came back, I lied and said it was a family emergency, which wasn't technically wrong. Two weeks later, Kevin posted Instagram Stories from some.

Kevin noticed first. Why didn't Emma have lunch money today? Her teacher called. I shrugged. Not my kid, not my problem. The girls noticed, too, but they didn't say anything at first. Emma had to walk to school twice because I didn't wake her up. Grace wore the same shirt three days straight because I stopped doing their laundry. But I didn't say anything. I just watched. Until one night I was heading to bed when I walked past Emma's bedroom and heard crying, ill, ugly sobbing. I almost kept walking, but something stopped me. I knocked softly. Emma, go away, she choked out. But I pushed the door open anyway. She was sitting on her bed holding a piece of paper, tears streaming down her face. I didn't mean to find it, she whispered. It was a letter, a letter I had written to myself but never sent, something my therapist had suggested when I was struggling with feeling like an outsider in my own home, a place where I could pour out everything I never dared say out loud. Emma had found it in my desk drawer while looking for tape for a school project. The letter said everything, how hard it was to love kids who didn't love me back, how scared I was of losing them if Kevin and I ever divorced, how I would give anything just to Hear one of them call me mom even once, how I cried in my car after every soccer game when they ran past me to hug their dad like I was invisible. How I bought them Christmas presents in July because I was so excited to make their holiday special.

My dad became that guy. The recently divorced man in his late 50s dating a girl in her early 20s. And I don't mean that in the age is just a number way. I mean it like when your dad's girlfriend is literally younger than you are, and he parades her around like a trophy. Two years after divorcing mom because he cheated, dad started bringing Becky to family dinners, coffee shops, and basically anywhere he could show off his obvious midlife crisis. The whole thing reeked of transaction from day one. But dad acted like he discovered the fountain of youth instead of just become a walking cliche. Over the next four months, Dad's behavior got progressively worse. First, he started getting handsy with Becky in public. Hand on her thigh at restaurants, arm around her waist at family events, whispering in her ear like teenagers while everyone else tried not to stare. He began showing up at Mom's favourite coffee shop with Becky every Tuesday, knowing full well that's where mom went for her weekly catch up with friends. When I called him out on it, he just shrugged and said the coffee was good. At my cousin's wedding, he spent the entire reception introducing Becky to relatives as his better half. While mom sat alone at the family table, his golf buddies started making gross comments. About upgrading and asking if Becky had any single friends, which dad would laugh off like it was all harmless fun. Every time I tried to express how uncomfortable their relationship made me feel, he'd wave me off with condescending bull crap about how I'd understand when I was older, which was rich, considering his girlfriend was younger than me. By month four, it became clear that dad had completely lost sight of how he was treating the women in his life and genuinely believe this whole situation was perfectly normal. That's when dad called to announce he was throwing Becky a massive garden party for her birthday, complete with catering, a live DJ, and a guest list full of his business partners and their wives. You have to come, he said, practically giddy. Becky's

Tonight, I discovered it's not a tradition. It's a death sentence. Everyone thinks it's just tradition. You take my great grandfather's 1967 Mustang and drive Route 47 through the mountains alone for three days. My dad did it, Uncle Marcus did it, and even my grandfather Ezra would get this weird look whenever someone mentioned the drive. I was actually excited because finally I get a break from college applications. The car itself is beautiful, with cherry red paint, white racing stripes, and original leather seats that smell like motor oil and something metallic I could never identify. The radio only picks up AM stations, but that's part of the charm, right? I left Saturday morning with my dad's handwritten directions, and Route 47 cuts through Millfield National Forest. 180 miles of nothing but trees and mountains. I hit the dead zone. Mile marker 23 was where the cell service cut out completely. But the radio started acting weird, too. Instead of static, I kept hearing fragments of conversations. A woman's voice saying, told you we shouldn't have come this way. A man laughing, kids singing. I figured it was atmospheric interference, but the voices were so clear and close, like they were right there in the car with me. At mile marker 31, I passed an abandoned gas station, and second I drove by, the radio exploded with sound. Cash registers ding, engine bells, and a cheerful Voice asking, fill her up. It lasted exactly 10 seconds, then cut back to silence. My hands were gripping the steering wheel so hard, my knuckles were white. Because this wasn't interference, but something else entirely, I started paying attention to every detail. Mile marker 45 had a rusty guard rail with fresh skid marks. And the radio screamed. Actual screaming, with a man's voice yelling, brake! Brake! Followed by the horrible crunch of metal. Mile marker 52 was an old hiking trail entrance. Children laugh. Then a woman saw, Emma? Emma, where are you? Every location had its own audio and memory, like the road was a giant recording device playing back moments from everyone who'd ever driven through. But here's what made my blood freeze. Some voices were familiar. Mile marker 67. I heard my Uncle Marcus, but teenage Marcus, his voice cracking as he said, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Please don't make me. Mile marker 78 played my dad's voice, 20 years younger, saying, it's watching me. God help me, it's actually watching me. And mile marker 89 had my

Last night it was my roommate. I should have known my studio apartment was too cheap to be real, but I was desperate after dropping out of college and needed something I could afford. The day I moved into Maple Street Apartments, two girls knocked on my door and told me the rules I'd apparently agreed to without reading my lease. Every night someone walks down the street screaming for help, said Zoe, a girl with choppy black hair who was sitting on my bed like she owned the place. Different person each time. They scream for about an hour. But we aren't supposed to help them. Her friend Luna, who had red braids and was chain smoking by my window, nodded grimly. It happens at different times every night. We never know when it's coming, but we get a warning on our phones. I laughed because it sounded like the stupidest prank I've ever heard. What kind of warning? You'll see, Zoe said with a wicked smile that made my stomach turn. That night they came back with two guys, Marcus and Tyler, carrying wine and cigarettes. We sat on my floor by the window and they explained how all the young people lived in our building, while families lived next door and elderly people lived across the street. We've been sorted into groups, Luna said, taking a long drag from her Cigarette around midnight all our phones went off at once with an ear splitting alarm like an Amber Alert, but louder. The sound echoed throughout the entire neighborhood. Hundreds of phones screaming in unison do not interfere! It's coming! Marcus whispered, and his whole demeanor changed from relaxed to terrified. We sat in complete silence for what felt like forever. And then I heard it in the distance. A cry for help, getting gradually closer and more desperate. I leaned out my fourth floor window and saw an elderly man in a blood stained hospital gown stumbling from door to door, leaving a trail of dark red behind him. Where his arms should have been there were only bloody stumps. And when he looked up at our building, I knew he was staring directly at me. Help me! He whispered, and then began screaming in a voice that didn't sound human. Luna yanked

What naive comment from your child exposed how much they had suffered before? My wife and I were trying to conceive for a long time, and even though we knew she was infertile and I couldn't produce proper seeds, we didn't give up. So when we finally saw the plus sign on a pregnancy test, I almost ran a Marathon. My wife cried so hard, it depleted all her energy. I was about to tell everyone in our lives, but my wife stopped me, saying she wanted to be sure before she told anyone. So we immediately booked a doctor's appointment. But the doctor delivered the worst news of our lives. It was a false positive, and my wife wasn't pregnant. We went home feeling defeated, and my wife barely said a word to me. I couldn't even think of anything new to say to her. I already told her, maybe next time we'll get lucky. Or we just need to keep trying. At this point, it just felt like I was lying to her. But then my wife said something that surprised me. She said, maybe we should adopt. I wasn't against the idea. It didn't matter to me how we got a kid. I just wanted one. So we started the adoption process after talking about it for a couple weeks to make sure this is something we really wanted to do. Fast forward to now. We adopted a boy named Lucas. He was nine and Small for his age, and we noticed he had this habit of being overly polite. My wife theorized that he was probably afraid we'd send him back to the orphanage if he breathed too loudly and said we needed to do our best to make him feel welcome. So we did. We gave him his own room, went shopping to decorate it, asked him to join us for movie nights and talk to him about his life. But it seemed like we were falling on deaf ears.

My daughter had asked to sleep in my room for the third time in a row. She's five, so I assume she was having nightmares. Or maybe she was going through a clingy phase. When she I asked for the fourth time, I said yes, and as I was tucking her in, I asked why she kept asking to sleep in my room. She couldn't look at me as she told me, because Mommy's friend gets into bed with me when you're gone. Her words didn't fully register at first. I asked her what she meant, and she repeated it, adding that Mommy says it's okay because he's like family. I couldn't sleep at all that night. The next morning, I told my wife what our daughter had said and asked if anyone had been over recently. She brushed it off almost instantly, laughing a little and saying our daughter probably meant a stuffed animal or had made something up. She said, you know how kids are and change the subject. The way she said it was off, as if she was prepared for that question and had her answer ready. A few days later, I told her I had to leave town for a short work trip. In reality, I stayed in a nearby hotel and logged into the security cameras I had installed last year after a neighbor's house had been broken into. I'd almost forgotten they were Even still active the next day, I got a motion alert around 9:30 p m. From the hallway camera. When I opened the feed, I saw a man I didn't recognize. He kiss my wife, who entered our bedroom right after. But the man kept walking through the hallway and went straight into my daughter's room. He just walked in like he belonged there. And my wife was fine with it. I was so scared for my daughter, I instantly got in my car and drove straight home. When I walked through the door, I didn't say a word. Not even when my wife popped out of our room and nervously asked me what I was doing back home so early. Push past her and went into my daughter's room. I turned the light on, and there was this man under the covers with my daughter and hovering over her like he was ready to pounce. Everything after that was a blur. I threw punches. He fought back. My wife yelled at me to stop. My daughter cried hard. After he was blue in the face. I picked up my daughter, grabbed

Years later, his worst fear came true. My father has always favored my sister. Not only does the family call him out on it, he admits to it. His defense is that my sister looks so much like our late mother that he can't help but spoil her. My sister caught onto this and used it to her advantage. If she wanted something from the store, she had to say, please, dad, and he would get it for her. If I asked for something, my dad would ask me what I had done to deserve it. And if I couldn't think of something good, I hadn't recently. I didn't get it. Never. My sister did something bad, she would begin to cry, and dad would easily forgive her. If I did something bad, I always had to face the full consequences. Dad would leave work and get my sister from school for anything as small as a splinter, while I could be throwing up. Dad would say he couldn't leave work, and I had to tough it out. I tried hard to earn his love and attention, but nothing worked. I tried excelling at school, acting out, and even forcing myself to get into his hobbies in hopes we would bond that way. The day I gave up was the day I found out how little my dad cared about me. I was Turning 15, the plan was for me, my dad, sister, uncle and two friends to go to an arcade two hours away. The day before my birthday, my sister got the sniffles. My dad could not travel and we would have to cancel the trip. I tried to convince him to leave her with our grandparents, but he didn't want to leave her to suffer alone. He told me to call my friends and tell them while he went and called my uncle. After he walked away, I went and cried my eyes out. About a gallon of tears. Later, I got a call from my uncle telling me not to worry. He would take us to the arcade. I had a great time and forgot all about my dad and sister.

We were heading to Hawaii. Supposed to be a nice, peaceful family vacation. You know, the kind where you pretend your relatives are likeable for five to seven business days while slowly roasting under the sun. Half the family was already there, sipping pina coladas and posting filtered sunsets on Instagram with captions like vitamin C. Meanwhile, I'm still in the airport, running on three hours of sleep, no caffeine, no gooning, and exactly one functional brain cell. And my son is in full gremlin mode. All I wanted was to get through T S A, board the plane, and flat line peacefully for six hours while pretending I'm not sitting in economy with my knees in my chest. But no. We're walking through security. I'm taking off my belt like a nervous strip. The line is long, my kids chewing gum like a mob boss. And suddenly, out of nowhere, this boy turns to a TSA agent, points at me, and says, dad, why won't you show him the dangerous thing in your bag? You stupid. The bitch! That sentence aged me 15 years and 5 seconds. I look down at him, stunned, like he just confessed to murder on my behalf. What dangerous thing? I don't even carry nail clippers. I'm the kind of person who apologizes to metal detectors, but TSA. TSA doesn't do nuance. They heard dangerous plus bad bag and activated airport SWAT mode. Like they Were auditioning for C S. I fear it Airlines Edition. Suddenly, I'm surrounded. One guy grabs my arm, another grabs my bag. I'm being yanked out of line like I'm on America's most wanted dad edition. And someone shouts, don't move! Like I'm going to backflip into an escape tunnel and flip flops. They pull me into a side room so fast, I swear my soul got left behind in G D. 12. Inside, it's like an interrogation scene from a low budget crime show. Fluorescent lighting, cold metal chair. The kind of silence that smells like latex gloves. And judgment. They go through my bag like it's the Ark of the Covenant. My bikini, flying socks getting sniffed. At one point, a man

There are moments in life where you're just trying to be a decent human. And then there are moments where that decency gets turned into a federal crime scene. This is about one of those moments. I was at the mall already. A place where humanity goes to die. I didn't even wanna be there. But my phone charger had just died for the third time that month, and I was tired of holding it at the perfect 47 degree angle just to get two percent battery. I go to one of those overpriced tech kiosks in the middle of the mall. The ones run by people who either want to sell you a screen protector or aggressively thread your eyebrows. While I'm waiting to be ignored by the guy behind the counter, I see this woman walking by. Middle aged, red coat, large sunglasses, indoors, like she's avoiding paparazzi. And she drops a bunch of coins. Not bills, not a card, coins. Like she was paying rent in 2003. They scatter across the floor like she just cast a spell in a Sonic the hedgehog game. And everyone around just watches, like the floor suddenly turned into lava because the coins touched it. So, being a functioning human being, I bend down and help her gather them up. I don't say anything. I'm not trying to strike up a conversation. Just grab a few quarters, put Them in a neat little pile and stand up like, here you go. That's when she steps back, eyes wide, and says, I didn't say you could touch me. And she says it loud. I freeze, ma'am. I touch the floor. She looks around dramatically, scanning for witnesses, like we're filming a courtroom drama. I don't feel safe right now, she says. Then she locks eyes with mall security. And mall security, of course, is already walking toward us, like they just sensed a disturbance in the pretzel force. At this point, I'm standing there holding a nickel, like it's the security. Guy walks up, is there a problem here? She points at me like I'm an escaped criminal. He tried to take my money and got all up in my space. I don't know him. He just came out of nowhere.

So I made her start hearing voices in the walls. She lit the match that killed my sister and walked away richer for it. My sister Claire lived on the top floor of that crumbling apartment complex. She was already planning to move out, saving every penny. But she didn't get the chance. The fire started at 2:00am. Four tenants barely escaped through smoke and stairwells. Claire didn't. The investigation said faulty wiring, but I knew better. We all did. The building had been half empty, half condemned. And our lovely landlord, Marjorie Shaw, had been whining for months about ungrateful tenants and rising taxes. And then suddenly, she's crying for the news cameras, standing outside with perfect makeup, sobbing about her beloved building. Within six weeks, she got her payout. $300,000. And Claire got a closed casket. I thought about killing her. I pictured it a thousand ways. But Claire wouldn't have wanted that. So I found a better kind of punishment. Marjorie used part of the insurance money to buy a dream home in the quiet hills outside town. Big place. Isolated, old. No neighbours close enough to hear anything. Perfect. I posed as a pest control worker and scoped it out a week before she moved in. Access? The crawl space, attic walls. I mapped the structure. The pipes, the old ductwork no one had touched in decades. This house had bones. Creaky ones. With the right pressure timing, Sound. It could speak, and I taught it how. Week one, two nights after she moved in, I started small. A soft tap, tap, tap in the ceiling above her bed. At 3:00am the next night, it was water dripping behind the walls in the hallway, pipes she didn't have. Then a whisper. Just one, while she brushed her teeth. Help me, she told herself. It was the house settling. Week two, I slipped in while she was out and placed an old baby monitor inside the wall vent in her living room. Nothing electronic on my end. It only played back a loop. Static, then faint giggling, then static again. She unplug

Do you know that feeling when you walk into a place thinking, hey, these people fix cars, and walk out thinking, oh, cool, I just donated $2,000 to the local scammers retirement fund? That's what happened to me, thanks to Randy. The human equivalent of a grease stain. So my check engine light came on. No biggie. No smoke, no shaking, no fast and furious soundtrack blaring from under the Hood. Just a little glowing light that basically says you're about to spend money you don't have. I took it to Randy's Auto Experts, a shop with five stars and one working bathroom. He walked out like a cartoon mechanic, greasy rag in hand, trucker hat, and a mustache that looked like it had seen things. He said, don't worry, we'll take care of you. That was line number one. Two hours later, he came back with the confidence of a surgeon who just found your wallet wide open. So your catalytic converter is done, your brake lines are shot, and your transmissions throwing tantrums. I blinked. My car was driving fine yesterday. He nodded. Like a profit. Yeah, well, sometimes they just explode quietly. How much? I asked, clutching my dignity. Parts and labor. Around $2,000. But that's a steal, he said, like I should be thanking him for the privilege of being robbed. I hesitate, but I needed the car, so I said yes. That was mistake number one. Fast forward a week, and $2,000 later, I pick it up, and it looks fine. Smells like burnt coffee, but fine. Three days later, the check engine light popped back on. Like, surprise! I missed you. I took it to a real mechanic, one who didn't look like he moonlit as a carnival ride operator. He popped the hood, glanced around, and went, uh, this hasn't been touched at all. Turns out Randy hadn't replaced anything. Just clear the error codes and maybe spit on the engine for good luck. Now, at this point, I had two options. Cry into a pillow, make it my life's mission to legally and spectacularly destroy his business. Guess which one I picked first. I hit the internet. Google, Yelp, Facebook reviews. I wrote a novel titled This Place Robbed Me Blind and stole my will to live. I attached photos, receipts, and probably an emotional support gift. His rating dropped fast.

That was enough to set off my parental alarm bells. The next morning I took her straight to the army hospital. A kind but serious looking doctor examined her, his fingers pressing gently against her cheek as she flinched. Then with a grave expression, he pulled me aside. I don't want to alarm you, he said. Look, looking very much like he was about to alarm me, but this appears to be an extremely rare form of facial cancer. He rattled off some long, ominous sounding name that I promptly forgot in my rising panic. He scheduled a consultation for the next afternoon with a team of specialists. As we left, I decided not to tell ginger. Why worry her if there was even in a small chance it was nothing? The next day she came home from school early and we headed back to the hospital. As I parked the car, she suddenly scrunched up her face and started spitting. Ugh, that tastes awful, she said, gagging. She spit into a Kleenex, revealing a tiny hard blob in the middle of her saliva. Inside, six doctors stood waiting for us, their faces a perfect mix of concern and professional anticipation. This was a rare Case after all, I nudged ginger. You better show them the Kleenex. She held it out, and the expressions on their faces shifted in real time. Concern turned to confusion, confusion to disappointment. One of them sighed. It wasn't cancer. It wasn't even remotely serious. It was just a Calcium deposit that had decided to make a dramatic exit through her saliva gland at the perfect moment. Relief flooded through me, but I couldn't help but notice the doctors

Harper looked at me and said, do you actually believe anything will happen? No, I admitted, but my family will freak. So we did what rational adults do. We eloped. Quiet ceremony, close friends, no announcements. We figured we'd have a bigger party later and just say it was on a different date. We even posted the photos. On December 4th to avoid triggering anyone. And for a while it worked until my uncle's wife, who has the social media skills of a teenage spy, zoomed in on a cake photo.

My uncle told me drop out of high school and start a lawn care business. Rich people are too lazy to mow their own grass, and they'll pay anything to avoid sweating. When I was 16, I was barely passing my classes, and everyone kept saying I needed to graduate to have any future. My parents were constantly on my case about grades, threatening summer school if I didn't bring up my G P A. But Uncle Mike had a different perspective. He'd been watching me work on his landscaping crew during summer since I was 14. Your wasting time in those classrooms, he said. One afternoon, while we were edging a mansion's lawn, these people just paid me $200 to cut grass that took two hours. Do the math on what college graduates make per hour versus what I charge. That conversation stuck with me. Started paying attention to how much customers were willing to spend on lawn care. One lady paid $150 every week just for basic mowing and trimming. Another guy paid $500 monthly for full landscape maintenance. These weren't struggling families. They were doctors and lawyers who valued their time more than money. Everyone thought I was crazy. When I dropped out junior year, my parents threatened to kick me out. My teacher said I was throwing my life away. My friends couldn't believe I was choosing yard work over a diploma. You'll regret this forever. My guidance counselor warned, nobody respects people without education. But I took my savings from working weekends and bought a used truck, commercial mower, and basic equipment. I started with my uncle's overflow customers who needed extra help during busy season. Word spread.

I just had a quick question about his homework. Nothing urgent, but are you currently living in a hotel? The question hit me like a truck. Excuse me? I asked. No, we're in an apartment. Why? She hesitated. It's just that in his assignment he wrote that he and his mom live in a hotel. And while the rest of the essay is a little unusual, I drove to the school, heart pounding. I knew my son had an overactive imagination, but now I was nervous. Had I said something in passing that confused him? Or worse, had I missed something he was trying to say? Missus Connelly handed me his paper when I arrived. My life in the hotel by Oliver G. I live in a hotel with my mom. It doesn't have a front desk or a breakfast buffet like the ones in movies, but it has vending machines and neighbors who yell a lot, which is kind of the same. Our room has one big bed. I sleep on the side near the AC because mom says she gets cold easily. I like that I can hear the trains at night. They sound like monsters in the distance. We used to have A real house. It had carpets and stairs and a garage door that beeped. I miss it. But mom says it's okay because we're having an adventure. She says we're just between homes. I don't know where between is, but I think it must be where tired people go. Sometimes mom cries in the bathroom. I know because I can hear the faucet running. And she only run.

When I was 12, I asked my dad why I didn't look like anyone in our family photos. He laughed and said I was just a late bloomer, that I'd grow into the family features eventually. My mom nodded along, saying, some kids take after distant relatives, but I never did grow into those features. While my parents and older brother all had dark hair and brown eyes, I had blond hair and green eyes. Teachers would do double takes at parent teacher conferences, clearly wondering if I was adopted. The questions followed me through high school. Friends would joke about me being the mailman's kid, and my parents would just laugh it off. Genetics are funny, they'd say. You never know what combinations you'll get. When I was 18 and applying for college scholarships, I needed my birth certificate for financial aid. That's when I found something strange. In my mom's filing cabinet, two birth certificates with my name on them. One listed my parents as usual, but the the other had different names entirely. I confronted my mom about it, and she broke down crying. We were going to tell you when you turn 21, she sobbed. We just wanted you to feel like you belonged. First. Truth was devastating. My biological mother was my mom's younger sister, Sarah, who'd gotten pregnant at 17. The family was deeply religious and couldn't handle the scandal, so they sent Sarah away for the pregnancy. When I was born, my parents officially adopted me, but told everyone I was theirs. Sarah had died in a car accident when I was three, and the family decided to keep the secret rather than burden me with the truth. Everyone in our extended family knew except me. But

The hugs stopped completely. If I tried to hug him, he'd pat my back twice and step away like I was on fire. At first, I thought I smelled bad or something. I started using extra deodorant and changing clothes twice a day. When that didn't work, I figured maybe I was getting too old for hugs.

It was just a normal purple T-shirt I'd worn 100 times before. What's wrong with it? You know what's wrong with it. But I didn't know.

He'd get visibly jealous whenever other guys talk to me at parties, always finding excuse just to interrupt conversations or pull me away. He bought me flowers just because, remembered my coffee order perfectly. And we'd spend entire weekends together, binge watching shows and cooking dinner like a real couple. My friends all assumed we were dating. My family invited him to barbecue. Even his mom would ask about his girlfriend when she called. But whenever anyone directly asked if we were together, Zane would laugh it off awkwardly. Oh, no, we're just really close friends. I'm not ready for anything serious right now. It stung every single time, but I kept hoping he'd come around. I thought maybe he just needed more time to feel comfortable with labels. Last Friday night changed everything. We were at Kelsey's birthday party, and this girl, Alexis from his work showed up. She was clear, really flirting with him all night, touching his arm, laughing way too loud at his jokes. Finally, she looked me up and down and asked directly, so are you his girlfriend or what? Without hesitation, Zane immediately said, oh, no, we're definitely not together. I'm completely single. Actually, he even stepped Slightly away from me. When he said it, the humiliation hit me like a truck. Everyone with an earshot was staring. Kelsey looked mortified for me. I felt my cheeks burning with embarrassment. But instead of running away, crying like I wanted to, something clicked. I was done being his convenient placeholder.

I replied, I'm getting married next month, and she completely lost her mind. I'm Aaron, 29, physical therapist in Denver. Eight months ago, I thought I had life figured out with Allison, my girlfriend of two years. We were living together, splitting rent, and I was shopping for engagement rings during lunch breaks. Then came that Tuesday night in February. Allison seemed off all day, distracted, checking her phone constantly. When we got home, she sat me down with this serious expression. I need to talk to you about something important. She dad fidgeting with our throw pillow. I've been thinking about my life. My stomach dropped. Nothing good ever started with those words. I've realized I've been jumping from relationship to relationship since I was 18. I've never taken time to figure out who I am as an individual. I don't know what I want for my career or what makes me happy outside of whoever I'm dating. The breakup speech was, I need to work on myself. I need space to figure out who I am. I'm not ready for anything serious. I need to learn how to be alone. She seemed genuine, even Cried, explaining how this wasn't about me personally, how I was amazing, but she needed to do this for herself. I respect did her decision, even though my world was collapsing. I helped her pack that weekend, staying calm while internally screaming. She found a studio apartment and seemed relieved loading boxes. I hope you understand someday, she said. Leaving. This is something I have to do. I wished her well and watched her drive away, then spent hours staring at empty spaces where her things used to be. I didn't reach out after that. If she needed space, I'd respect. I removed her from social media, not from anger, but because seeing her new life would have been torture. Six weeks later, my friend Matt invited me to join his volleyball league.

They sat at the main table, my parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, ordering champagne, lobster, everything expensive on the menu. I sat alone watching them toast to our family success while I wasn't even included. That's when I got an idea. I called the waiter over and quietly said, see that big table? I'm paying for everything. Just bring me the check when they're done. He nodded and walked away. For the next hour, I watched them feast. Three hundred dollar wine bottles, multiple appetizers, desserts. They were having the time of their lives. My aunt ordered three different entrees just to try them. My uncle got the most expensive scotch on the menu. My mom kept calling the waiter over like he was her personal servant. And through it all, I sat in my corner sipping water, watching them celebrate my achievement without me. My cousin Hannah kept taking photos for Instagram. Family dinner vibes she posted, making sure I wasn't in any of the shots. Uncle Joseph started telling. Embarrassing Stories about my childhood. Remember when little Zachary wanted to be a superhero? They all laughed while I sat there feeling like I was 12 again. Finally, they started getting up to leave. That's when I stood up and announced, thanks for celebrating with me, everyone.

I replied, okay. When they tried to log into the company servers the next day, they realized the family business was built entirely on the code I had just revoked. I, twenty eight male, just got the most hilarious text from my brothers. After five years of building what they called the family business, they've decided to vote me out. My brother's Garrett, 35, and Toby, 32, started a logistics consulting firm in 2019. What they actually had was a fancy name, business cards, and exactly zero clients. Six months in, they came crawling to me. Fresh out of college with a computer your science degree, they needed someone to handle the website. What they actually needed was someone to build an entire automated system from scratch. Client portal, inventory tracking, route optimization, payment processing, the works. Took me eight months of nights and weekends. They paid me in pizza and promises. Here's the thing. I never transferred ownership of the code. It's all licensed through my personal LLC. They signed without reading because we're family. Fast forward five years. We're pulling in $2.8 million annually. My systems handle everything. They just shmooze clients and collect checks. Last week, things got interesting. Garrett's wife, Mallory, suddenly became operations director, a made up position where she reorganizes filing cabinets and changes email fonts. Toby's girlfriend, Kelsey, became social media manager for our B to B company that doesn't even Need Instagram. Both making DOLLAR85K annually by the way. Meanwhile, I'm still maintaining every line of code, updating systems, handling server crashes at 2:00am, and taking my measly 20% cut as the tech guy yesterday at four PM. Hey, we held a partner's meeting and voted. You're out. The business needs to evolve beyond just tech stuff. Hack.

I spent the first 12 years of my life calling my mom Tori. Not mom, not Mama, just Tori. Like she was my older sister or something, because that's what everyone told me. She was my actual sister. Granny raised me, and she'd always say stuff like, go ask your sister Tori when I needed help with homework, or Tori, take your sister to the store. I thought it was totally normal. My friend Emma had an older sister who babysat her sometimes, so I figured that's just how families worked. Tori was 17 when I was 12, which should have been my first clue, but kids don't really do math like that. She picked me up from school every day in this beat up Honda with a cracked windshield. She'd blast music and let me sit in the front seat, which made me feel so cool. She came to every parent teacher conference with Granny, crying when I got good grades, like she was actually proud. When I had chicken pox in third grade, Tori skipped her junior prom to stay home and put calamine lotion on my spots. I remember asking her why she wasn't going to the dance in her pretty dress, and she just said, proms are stupid anyway while dabbing my forehead. The truth came out in the weirdest way. I was being nosy one day, digging through this old shoebox, In Granny's closet, looking for pictures for a school project. That's when I found a birth certificate with my name on it, but where it said mother, it had Tori's full name written there. Tori Lynn Jackson. Not Granny's name. Tori's. I stared at that paper for, like, ten minutes, reading it over and over. My brain couldn't process it. I ran downstairs, waving the certificate, yelling, why does this say Tori is my mom? The whole house went dead silent. Granny was making cornbread, and she just stopped stirring. Tori was doing homework at the kitchen table, and her pencil froze mid word.

When I was 29, I'd already been through this song and dance with doctors like five times. Every time I went in for anything, they'd look at me, see that I was heavy, and blame whatever was wrong on my weight. Headaches, lose weight. Back pain. Lose weight. Weird rash, probably from sweating too much. Lose weight. So when I started getting these crazy chest pains, I already knew what was coming. But these weren't like normal chest pain. They felt like someone was stabbing me right through my sternum with a hot knife. Sharp, sudden, and deep. I'd be sitting there watching TV and suddenly feel like I was being impaled. I went to the ER on a Tuesday night around nine PM. The place was packed. But when you say chest pain, they usually take you back pretty quick. The attending doctor was this middle aged guy who walked in, took one look at me, and I could literally see him making assumptions. He poked my stomach a few times, asked how much I exercised, and said the pain was probably just acid reflux or anxiety from stress eating. I tried to explain that it didn't feel like heartburn at all. This was different. But he was already writing something on his clipboard. He handed me a prescription for antacids and told me to cut back on spicy foods and maybe try Yoga for stress. I didn't even bother filling the prescription. What was the point? They never listen anyway. My roommate Katie was pissed when I told her what happened. She'd been dealing with the same kind of medical bias for years. We both joked about how doctors think being fat is some kind of terminal illness that causes every other symptom in the world. Three days later, I was brushing my teeth before bed when everything went weird. My vision got all blurry and spotty, like when you stand up too fast, but way worse. I sat down on the edge.

I tried explaining that my Epipen wasn't optional, that I could literally die without it. She just kept repeating that I needed to trust the universe and that my allergy was probably psychosomatic.

No more braiding Grace's hair before school. Or listening to Emma practice her presentations. I stopped signing permission slips. I stopped packing their lunches.

Inside was our cat, whiskers tumbling around. I yanked the door open and grabbed our terrified cat. Whiskers was panting and shaking, but thankfully okay. Ethan just stood there watching me, completely calm. What the hell is wrong with you? I screamed. He tilted his head like he was genuinely confused by my reaction. I was curious how many spins it could handle before it stopped moving. I told Paul immediately. He got this uncomfortable look on his face and said, kids are naturally curious about how things work.

I had the catering team practice the service twice, made sure every centerpiece was exactly 12 inches apart, and even had backup generators ready in case of power issues. One hour before the event started, the V P. Of marketing walked up to me holding this thick binder. Here's the speech you're reading tonight. He said, not even looking at me. Keep it under two minutes. We've got real award.

I had just finished my overnight shift at the community clinic, still wearing my scrubs, beat up sneakers, and my old backpack covered in pins and a small stitched tear my daughter had fixed with purple thread. I was exhausted, but I had a mission that couldn't wait. My younger brother Jake, was graduating medical school in two weeks. Our dad had promised him a Rolex when he finished, but he died of a heart attack three years ago before he could keep that promise. I've been saving for two years to make it happen myself. $27,000 in cash sitting in my checking account. I stopped at the luxury shopping plaza on my way home. The watch store had white marble walls and spotless glass counters that probably cost more than my car. I walked in and immediately felt out of place, but I approached the display of stainless steel watches anyway. I waited and waited. One saleswoman made eye contact with me, looked at my backpack, then looked away. Another whispered something to her coworker while glancing in my direction. Five minutes passed, 10 minutes. Still no one offered to help. Finally, I spoke up. Excuse me, I'm looking for a submariner. Do you have any in stock? The manager, a woman in her 50s wearing more jewelry than I made in a month, turned around. He looked me up and down. Slowly taking in my hospital shoes and wrinkled scrubs without even walking closer, she replied. Those aren't available to browse. You have to be an established client for that level of timepiece. We don't keep inventory on the sales floor for walk in.

I'd walk into places feeling hopeful, fill out applications, interview well, then get that call a few days later. Sorry, we've decided to go with someone else. I was down to my last 20 bucks when I walked into this small tech repair shop downtown. The owner was this older guy named Eli, probably in his 60s, with thick glasses and grease stains on his shirt. Place smelled like burnt circuits and coffee. Most people took one look at me and made assumptions. Eli just handed me a broken laptop and said, fix this if you can. You're hired. The screen was cracked, wouldn't boot up, making these weird clicking sounds. I popped it open, saw the hard drive was loose, reseated the RAM and had it running in under an hour. Eli watched me work the whole time, nodding quietly. When can you start? He asked. I told him about my record right there. Figured he deserved to know before hiring me. He just shrugged and said, everyone deserves a second chance. Some people just need it more than others. For two years, Eli taught me everything. Hardware, software, how to talk to customers, how to run a business. He paid me fair wages. Never made me feel like a charity case. Never brought up my past.

I was 26 when my mother died. I didn't cry. Not because I didn't care, but because after a lifetime of being her emotional punching bag, my heart had already broken years ago. Growing up, mom treated me like I was invisible, unless she needed someone to blame. When dad left dishes in the sink, it was my fault for not cleaning them when the bills were late. Somehow I was responsible. My older brother, Kevin got straight A's and played football. I got screamed at for bringing home a B+ in chemistry. Every family dinner was the same routine. Kevin would talk about his accomplishments while I sat there quietly eating. If I tried to share anything about my day, mom would cut me off and say something like, nobody cares about your stupid little stories. Then she'd turn back to Kevin and light up like a Christmas tree. When I was 16, she kicked me out in the middle of a thunderstorm because I forgot to take out the trash. I had to sleep in my car that night. Kevin never even asked where I'd been. The funeral was exactly what you'd expect. Kevin gave this beautiful eulogy about how mom was the heart of our family and always put her children first. I sat in the second row watching him cry real tears. Part of me wondered if we Even had the same mother. After the service, everyone went back to Mom's house. The same house where I'd scrubbed floors since I was 10 while Kevin played video games. The same kitchen where she told me I'd never be good enough every single day. That night, everyone got bedrooms except me. I slept on the living room couch. While relatives I barely knew took over my childhood room. Nobody offered me anything else. It was like I was still the family ghost. Around three in the morning, I couldn't sleep. I walked through that dark house, touching everything one last time.

So there I was, walking home from another failed job interview, feeling like the biggest loser on the planet. That's when I passed this garage sale in some random neighborhood. Most of it was typical garage sale junk, but sitting in the driveway was this beat up mountain bike. Thing looked like it hadn't been touched in years. Covered in dust, chain was rusty, and there was this handwritten cardboard sign taped to it that said, take it. $10 breaks sort of work. I checked my wallet. 13 bucks left to my name. I stood there for like, five minutes debating whether to buy it. Ten dollars was basically half my food budget for the week, but something told me to just do it. The lady running the sale was this older woman named Carol. When I handed her the 10, she looked at me and said, honey, you sure about this? That thing's been sitting here for two years. I told her I was sure. She shrugged and took my money. The bike was worse than I thought. Seat was wobbly as hell. One brake Lever just dangled there doing nothing. And the gears made this grinding noise every time I pedaled. But it moved. That's all that mattered. Two days later, I got a call about a job interview.

My son turned eight last Saturday and his mom threw him this huge party at her parents house with bouncy castles and a magician. Probably 50 people there. I showed up with my gift wrapped in newspaper because I couldn't afford wrapping paper and my ex wife's sister actually laughed out loud when she saw it. Her husband pulled me aside and said I should be embarrassed showing my face here when everyone knows I'm three months behind on child support and asked if I even knew what grade he was in. I wanted to tell him that I actually knew his teacher personally because I've been volunteering at his school every lunch hour. But instead I just stood there and took it because arguing would just make everything worse for my boy. The whole party was basically two hours of my ex wife's family taking turns humiliating me while I tried to stay invisible near the fence. Her mom kept making these loud comments about how some fathers actually provide for their children and her dad walked past me carrying my son's new bike and said maybe someday I could afford to buy my child something that didn't come from a thrift store. When they brought out the cake and my son wanted me to stand next to him for photos, his grandmother literally stepped in front of me and said they wanted pictures with people who were actually Part of his life. I watched my boy's face fall and it took everything in me not to say something, but I knew they'd just use it against me and court. My ex wife's aunt asked me directly in front of everyone if I was still working that pathetic warehouse job or if I've been fired from that too. And when I said I was still there, she said at least my son would learn what not to become. My ex wife stood there telling her cousins that I lived in some disgusting studio apartment and probably spent my child support money on beer, while her sister nodded along and said some people just aren't meant to be fathers and that's okay. That's when a Grace Dan pulled up and this exhausted looking woman got out, carrying a thick folder and walking straight through the party toward me like everyone else was invisible. She looked distressed and said she was sorry, but this couldn't wait another day because the state was threatening to pull the placement if she didn't get the inspection done immediately. My ex wife's mom immediately stepped forward.

Dylan didn't say a word. Security found you in the third floor bathroom. Morrison pulled out a folder. Photos spilling across his desk 12 times this Month alone.

And what are you talking about? Aiden pounded like a puppy. I heard him! I heard the man on your headphones! Alexis giggled. Aiden, it's not what you think it's. Before she could finish, Aiden had already walked back out the doors, too heartbroken to stay a minute longer. When he came back, Aiden was cold, looking at her with the face of a broken man. Alexis tried to explain, but Aiden refused to listen. So what exactly did you end up hearing, and what man are we talking about? I asked. Aiden pulled out a portable speaker. Listen to this. All of a sudden, a deep, gravelly male voice growled out, I love the way you tremble when I whisper in your ear. My eyes widen.

Right. This happened in 2014, and no one was arrested until 2022. The story is pretty twisted. This is Donna Adelson, the grandmother, but we'll get back to her in a minute. This is her daughter, Wendy Adelson. And this was Wendy's husband, Dan Markel. Wendy and Dan created a life for a while until it just no longer worked. They got divorced, but then they ensued in a custody battle. You see, Wendy wanted to move 370 miles south of Tallahassee to southern Florida with their two sons. Dan was a law professor at Florida State University, and he absolutely refused to relocate. This was going to prevent Wendy from leaving with the kids. In comes Donna again. Apparently, Wendy's mother, Donna, wanted to help with the situation. This is her son over here, Charlie Adelson. Apparently, Donna master minded this murder for hire plot utilizing her son's ex girlfriend. Here's Charlie. Here's his girlfriend, Catherine. Here's Catherine's baby daddy. Tuto was friends with Louis, and these two were part of the Latin Kings gang. These two were apparently hired to take out Dan. Wendy and Donna's problem. On July of 2014, those two stalked him, followed him to his house, and ended up taking his life in his garage. Now, Dan's unaliving went unsolved for nearly a decade. It wasn't until 2022 that they were finally able to link this unaliving to the son Charlie. Adelson at that time it was found that Charlie and his then girlfriend Katie had hired these two to do the plot. Louis took a plea deal and is serving 19 years behind Bar. Tutu was found to be the trigger man, serving life behind bars. Charlie and Katie were also sentenced to a life behind bars. But let's not forget Donna and all of this who hated her son in law. Donna also avoided arrest for nearly a decade. She was being investigated, although she clearly denied that she had anything to do with this. Basically she let her son take the fall. But in November of 2023, Donna was arrested in the Miami International Airport. She had a one way ticket to Vietnam, which she later admitted that she was aware that they have a no extradition policy. She waited for quite some time for her trial, but on September 4th the judge handed down the verdict and she was found guilty. And she wailed and cried for nearly two minutes as the judge had to send the jury out while she collected herself. It was found that she had orchestrated this entire murder for hire plot, gotten together $100,000, which she came from a pretty affluent family and area anyways, and that she indeed did deserve to be behind bars.

Maybe for one of the bartenders that you picked up off the street, but for someone who has experience, it's not that hard. Okay, well, maybe that's something that we'll revisit in like two or three months when you've kind of got the hang of everything again. David, I don't know where you got this idea that I'm struggling, but I'm fine. Okay, next, I think we should get All different beers. These beers are disgusting.

I cannot believe you would send my order like this after I explicitly told you not to. Is this Jim? Yes, I just waited almost 30 minutes for an incorrect order to show up at my house. See, this is why you guys work in restaurants because you can't follow simple instructions. Jim, if you want to talk about following instructions, the only reason why this whole thing is happening is because you selected the wrong item on Doordash so you wouldn't have to pay the difference. That's not true. It was a mistake. Okay, well, that's fine. I told you that you could reorder if you wanted to, but we can't give you something that you didn't pay for. Let me talk to a manager right now. Well, unfortunately, our manager is gone for the night, but what can I help you with? Oh my God, this is fucking useless. I've been treated like absolute shit by this company and I want a full refund, right? Okay, well, since you ordered through Doordash, all returns will have to be processed through them. No, you know what? I'm sick of this bullshit. I'm not getting off the phone until I get a refund. Okay, well, again, we can't process your refund, but I will say you got the items you paid for. We deliver them in a timely manner. So I don't know if that's gonna work out for you. Oh, well, I don't Give a fuck what you think. You're obviously not the manager. You're not gonna be issuing my refund. So if you could please transfer me to someone who could, that would be great. Uh hmm. The Doordash app can issue your refund. No, I wanna be done with this stupid mess. I just want my refund now. Okay. Well, even if we were gonna offer you a refund, all of our payment is done through Doordash. So unfortunately, we cannot process a refund for you. Oh, yeah, well, you better figure it out because like I said, I'm not getting off this phone until I have a refund. Okay, I understand.

I'm assuming that it's just us two clients that you have. Is it just the two of them that you have or I thought you had a third one, right? It's just the two of them, but she's processing and when she's done, Siri will need to rinse and blow dry her because I will be busy working on you. Yeah, see, as I was saying, Siri's assistance is needed. Let Siri do me and you can be the one to rinse and blow dry that client because, because what if Siri is working on me? Then you're not working on me, which means you don't need her to blow dry and style your other client. You can do it. I just want you to know that Siri hasn't even been licensed for a year yet, whereas she has been doing this practically as long as Siri's been alive, you know? Uh, so that's why there's a difference in the prices because there's a clear difference in the skill set. So are you okay with that? I only have medium brown hair. It's a retouch. Not rocket science and certainly not worth $400. Sorry, Karen, can you go make sure that she knows she has a client?

But when the cashier discovered why, she immediately called the police. Max, 12 years old, had caught the attention of Maria, a cashier at a supermarket. But she never could have imagined the terrible secret the boy was hiding. He came to the store every day to buy baby diapers. At first, Maria thought it was cute, but as the days went by, she became more and more intrigued by the boy's purchases. For her, it was impossible that Max was using diapers at his age. Maria wanted to understand, so she decided to follow the boy. After 15 minutes of walking, Max stopped in a secluded area and that's where Maria discovered what Max was doing with the diapers. It was horrifying. Maria started screaming. She immediately called the police. What Max was actually doing with the diapers will send chills down your spine. Tap the plus and type diapers if you want part two.

When I was in my junior year, our principal called an emergency assembly that changed everything. As we filed into the auditorium, I noticed all the teachers had red eyes like they'd been crying. The principal's voice cracked as she announced that our beloved chemistry teacher, Missus Andrews, had terminal brain cancer. She only had three months left. The auditorium erupted in sobs. Missus Andrews wasn't just any teacher. She stayed late helping students with homework, bought supplies for kids who couldn't afford them, and made everyone feel special. She refused to stop teaching, saying her students gave her strength. But each week we watched her deteriorate. Her once neat handwriting became shaky. She started forgetting things mid sentence. Sometimes she'd pause during class holding her head in pain. The administration hired a substitute, Mister Parker, to assist her, but we all knew he was really there to take over when she couldn't teach anymore. He'd stand awkwardly in the back of the room, making everyone uncomfortable. One day, Missus Andrews collapsed during third period. The ambulance came, but she insisted on finishing her lesson from the floor. While waiting, she made us promise to be good for Mister Parker. That was the last time we saw her in person. School arranged for us to video call her every Friday. At first, she was still herself, cracking jokes from her hospital bed, asking about our weekends. But soon the calls got shorter. Her hair fell out, dark circles formed under her eyes. Our class decided to do something special. We turned our final project into a massive research paper on experimental brain cancer treatments. We worked through lunch breaks and stayed late after school combing through medical journals. Even the bad kids were pulling all nighters doing research. Mr Parker caught us and instead of shutting it down, he helped. He connected us with actual cancer researchers who answered our questions. Our 20 page report grew to 100 pages. We included every promising treatment we could find. The day we finished, we Learned Missus Andrews had slipped into a coma. We sent the report to her husband anyway. He read it to her every day, highlighting different sections. The doctor said even in her coma, her vital signs would improve when he read it. Two weeks later, her husband called the school. He'd shown our report to her oncologist. One of the treatments we'd found, some obscure clinical trial in Finland, was something they hadn't considered. Her doctor made some calls. Missus Andrews got accepted into the trial. The school turned our morning announcements into daily updates on her condition. Missus Andrews completed her first treatment. Missus Andrews tumor shrank 3%. Missus Andrews opened her eyes. Four months later, we heard familiar footsteps in the hallway. Missus Andrews walked into class thin and weak but alive.

My mom once made spaghetti that was so bad, it got me grounded for a month. Growing up, my mom was obsessed with proving she was a better cook than my stepdad's ex wife. She'd spend hours watching cooking shows, buying fancy ingredients, and forcing us to try her experimental dishes. The problem? She was absolutely terrible at cooking. Like, accidentally set cereal on fire terrible. But we weren't allowed to say anything negative about her food. One time, my brother gagged on her special meatloaf and had to write Mom's cooking is a blessing 500 times. When I was 14, she decided to enter a local cooking competition. The grand prize was a feature in our town's newspaper. She spent weeks practicing her signature dish, seafood spaghetti with a secret sauce. The sauce was bright orange and smelled like someone had mixed ketchup with fish food. Night before the competition, she made us be her test audience. As soon as she put the plate in front of me, I knew something was wrong. The pasta was this weird gray color, and there were whole chunks of garlic floating in the sauce. Not minced garlic, entire cloves. My stepdad took one bite, and his face turned green. But he forced a smile and said, unique flavor profile, honey. My little sister started crying when mom tried to make her eat a shrimp that was still partially frozen. When it was my turn, I Couldn't do it. I couldn't lie anymore. I took one bite and immediately spit it out into my napkin. Mom, this is inedible. The pasta is raw in the middle, the sauce tastes like battery acid, and I think this shrimp might be alive. The kitchen went silent. My stepdad's fork clattered onto his plate. My sister stopped crying and stared at me with huge eyes. Mom's face turned the same color as her horrible sauce. Instead of yelling, she got scary calm. Oh, you think you could do better? She pushed her chair back from the table. The kitchen's all yours, Gordon Ramsay. I should have backed down. Instead, I stood up and said, actually, yes. I've been secretly taking cooking classes at the community center for the past year because I was tired of eating food that tastes like punishment. Mom's eyes started twitching. Prove it. I went to the kitchen and pulled out everything I needed. I've been practicing my own pasta sauce recipe for months, tweaking at each time. While I cooked, mom stood in the corner with her arms crossed, making these little hum noises. Thing is, I actually knew what I was doing. I'd Learned proper knife skills, temperature control, and how to balance flavors. An hour later, I plated my version of spaghetti and meatballs. Look on mom's face when everyone started eating and actually enjoying the food was priceless. My sister asked for seconds. My stepdad closed his eyes and made happy Noises while twirling his pasta even mom had to admit it was good after she tried it. But I was still grounded for a month for culinary insubordination.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together. I've been playing husband since year two. Paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent, while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down. Tears in her eyes, hand on her heart. Then some perfectly rehearsed excuse. We're not ready, let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal number five. And she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time. Convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere, and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it. When she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew. And she didn't even let me finish the speech. Just shook her head with this pitying smile. Like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke. Asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant. And the mask Came completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said, voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place? After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place? Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I'd spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. She didn't even notice until lunch, when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working. She texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said, I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic Started creep. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night, acting extra sweet, made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said, kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone.

Five years later, he was serving us drinks at my anniversary dinner. Right in the middle of his toast, Ryan put down his champagne and said, I can't do this. I'm in love with your sister. The room with 50 people went completely quiet. Chloe stood up from table three with her face totally white. Ryan, not like this. They left separately, while I just stood there holding my champagne. My parents were screaming, but I. I couldn't even breathe. That night, my cousin texted me. They're at his apartment. I felt sick reading it. Looking back, the signs were all there. Ryan kept skipping our wedding planning sessions. Chloe was missing family dinners. They wouldn't look at each other. At my birthday party. Some of my relatives had noticed something was off, but nobody wanted to say anything. Two weeks later, they were posting photos together. Chloe was wearing the bracelet I bought her as a bridesmaid gift. Ryan was teaching her all the recipes I taught him. Our friends immediately picked sides. They couldn't help their feelings. Like our three years together meant absolutely nothing to them. I deleted all my social media and moved back with my parents. But I didn't just sit around feeling sorry for myself. I took our wedding savings and enrolled in culinary school. Then I took hospitality management classes. At night, I worked three different jobs and Learned Everything from washing dishes to being. I was sleeping in my car between shifts. My parents kept asking me to slow down, but I couldn't stop. Working was the only thing keeping me from falling apart. While I was working 18 hour days, Ryan and Chloe were living together. They moved in after three months. They got engaged exactly one year after ruining my engagement party. The ring was definitely smaller than mine had been. Everyone noticed that. Ryan kept losing marketing jobs. Chloe's influencer career went nowhere. They got evicted twice. Mom told me, Ryan asked about you constantly. I didn't care anymore. I was actually building something real. Five years later, I was running three successful restaurants when I met Daniel at a wine vendor event. He owned a Vineyard up north. We stayed up all night talking about fermentation and flavour profiles. He made me laugh for the first time in years. Eight months later, he proposed at his Vineyard during sunset. It was small and private and perfect. We had a small wedding with just family and close friends. Chloe wasn't invited. Neither was Ryan. I never told Daniel their actual names. Just said my ex left me for someone close to me. He never asked for details, but my family kept me updated on them. Ryan couldn't keep a job. Chloe's Instagram career was dead. They were facing their third eviction. Mom mentioned, she's miserable, he's drinking. Dad added, they blame each other for everything. Meanwhile, I had my restaurant empire. I had a husband who absolutely adored me. I had success that I'd earned through all that pain. For our first anniversary, Daniel insisted we eat at my flagship restaurant. Where your empire started? I tried to suggest other places, but he'd already made reservations under his name. They promised the best table. The hostess seated us at table seven with a perfect view of the kitchen. Daniel ordered champagne to the woman who turned pain into power. Then I saw our server walking over. That walk, that nervous laugh. It was Ryan. He completely froze when he saw me. The champagne glasses were shaking on his tray. Five years had not been kind to him. He had a cheap haircut and that polyester.

So I'm getting married to my fiance in 6 weeks. I saved up for months to buy this gorgeous dress, $3,000. That took me forever to save working at a coffee shop while going to school. My future mother in law kept bugging me about trying it on since the day I brought it home. She'd text me constantly asking when she could see it. She'd show up to our apartment unannounced asking to peek at it. She even offered me a hundred bucks to let her try it on just once. I kept saying no because honestly, something felt off about how obsessed she was. Like, who gets that excited about someone else's wedding dress? My fiance thought I was being dramatic. He kept saying his mom just loves weddings and she's excited for us. But I stood my ground. The dress stays in my closet until my wedding day. Last Tuesday, I came home from my shift early because we were slow. I walked into our apartment and immediately heard my fiance panicking upstairs. He was texting someone frantically and blocking me from going to our bedroom. That's when I knew something was seriously wrong. I, I pushed past him and opened the door. There she was, his mother standing in front of my mirror wearing my wedding dress. My 3,000 dollar dress that I specifically told her she couldn't even look at. She had somehow gotten it on perfectly. The zipper was done up and everything. She was posing and taking selfies in it like it was some kind of photo shoot. When she saw me, her face went completely white. I pulled out my phone and snapped a picture before either of them could stop me. He started yelling at me to delete it, but I was already backing it up to the cloud. My fiance jumped in trying to calm everyone down saying it was just harmless fun and no damage was done. But I felt sick looking at the dress knowing she had been in it, taking pictures, probably planning to show all her friends. The whole thing felt violated. I told them both she had three days to Venmo me $3,000 for a replacement dress or I'm sending that photo to every single person in their family. Group chat, she burst into tears saying I was being cruel and that she just wanted to feel connected to our wedding. My fiance said I was overreact.

My daughter Emma is 25 and absolutely beautiful, not just physically, but she's charming in a way that makes everyone want to be around her. She's got this perfect smile and this laugh that makes guys lose their minds. Her boyfriend, Tyler, is head over heels for her. The poor guy follows her around like a lost puppy and talks about her like she hung the moon. But here's the thing, nobody knows. Emma is a diagnosed sociopath, has been since she was 18, though I knew something was off way before that. When she was 8, she locked her little sister Mia in the basement for three hours just to see what would happen. When I found Mia crying and scared in the dark, Emma was upstairs watching TV like nothing happened. When I asked her why she did it, she just shrugged and said she was curious. No tears, no sorry, nothing. School was a nightmare. Teachers called constantly about Emma lying to get other kids in trouble, stealing lunch money. And once she convinced a boy to eat glue by telling him it was candy. The counselor said she was just going through a phase, but I knew better. After years of therapy and medication, Emma Learned how to act normal. She, she studied other people like a science project, copying their emotions until she could fake them perfectly by High school, she was popular, dated constantly and had everyone fooled. The diagnosis came when she was 18, antisocial personality disorder. The doctor explained it in fancy terms, but basically Emma doesn't feel love, guilt or empathy. She can't. Her brain just doesn't work that way. We've had honest conversations about it since then. When her best friend died in a car accident last year, Emma cried at the funeral and gave this heartbreaking speech later that night. She told me she felt absolutely nothing. The whole thing was an act because that's what people expected. She's been with Tyler for almost two years now. He's a good guy, works as a teacher, volunteers at animal shelters, brings me coffee when he visits. He talks about marrying Emma constantly. Last week, he asked me for my blessing to propose. That's when I told Emma she needs to tell him the truth or I will. She laughed and said I'd never have the guts. She thinks I'm bluffing because she's my daughter and I love her. But Tyler deserves to know what he's signing up for. Emma flat out told me she doesn't love him, never has and never will. She likes the stability he provides and thinks he'll be a good father if they have kids. To her, marriage is just a business transaction. When I brought it up again yesterday, Emma got that cold look.

I should have known something was off when three teenagers approached me within five minutes of arriving at my cousin Rose's quinceanera. You Rafael's friend? A kid in a rented tux whispered, sliding up next to me by the fountain. No, I'm Claudia's cousin, I replied, adjusting my tie. He looked used, then nodded slowly. Yeah, yeah, Claudia's cousin. Got it. He slipped me a folded 20 and whispered, meet me by the bathroom in 10. Before I could respond, he vanished into the crowd. I stood there holding this random 20, completely baffled. My girlfriend Patricia found me looking lost. What wrong? Some kid just gave me money and wants to meet me in the bathroom, she laughed. Maybe he thinks you're the attendant. During dinner, another teenager sat down next to me. Claudia's cousin, right? Yeah. He slid $40 under my plate. My boy said, you're good. Can you hook me up after the father daughter dance? Hook you up with what? His eyes went wide. Oh, you need me to say it? Never mind. I'll find you later. By the time they were cutting the cake, I've been approached by six different kids, accumulated $180, and was starting to piece together what was happening. They thought I was someone's dealer. The revelation came when my cousin Claudia grabbed my arm during the Electric Slide. Why is everyone asking me about my cousin Hector? Who knows Rafael I'm your cousin, Hector. Yeah, but you don't know any Rafael. She studied my face, then started laughing hysterically. Oh, my god, you're wearing the same outfit. What? There's another Hector here? Claudia Morales's cousin? Not Claudia Delgado. Me. He apparently provides party favors for high school kids. I felt my stomach drop. I have $180 in my pocket from random teenagers. You took their money? They kept shoving it at me. We spotted him during the mariachi performance, and the resemblance was uncanny. Same build, same rented black suit, same age. The only difference was his gold tooth. But in the dim lighting, who could tell? Claudia dragged me over. Hector, meet Hector. Other Hector. Looked me up and down, then burst out laughing. You're the one causing all the confusion. Kids keep asking me why I'm sitting at table 12 instead of working. Your customers keep giving me money, I said, pulling out the bills. Keep it, he said, chuckling. Consider it compensation for the inconvenience. I can't keep drug money. What drug money? He said with mock innocence. I sell vape pens. Completely legal. These kids are just dramatic. In the tux reappeared. There's two of you? Different hackers. Different Claudius. Other hacker explained. You want your vape pen, you come to me. You want someone to bore you about accounting, you go to him. How do you know I'm an accountant? Lucky guess. He's. The rest of the night became a comedy of errors. Kids would Approach me, I'd point to other Hector. Other Hector's cousin started wearing a name tag that said, the other Claudia. My Claudia made jokes about having the bootleg Hector. Rose's mom, Mytia Elena, pulled me aside during the last dance. I heard there was some confusion with another Hector. Yeah, it's been sorted out. She looked at me seriously. Good. Because if you were doing what he does at my baby's, quinceanera, family or not, I'd end you. Tia, I work at H&R Block. I know, mijo. That's why it's so funny. You can't even jaywalk without having a panic attack. As we were leaving, other Hector caught up to me in the parking lot. Hey, accountant Hector, if you ever want to make some real money. Absolutely not. He laughed. I'm kidding. But seriously, keep the cash. Those kids Learned a valuable lesson.

I was 22, working double shifts at the hospital while finishing nursing school. My boyfriend had left three weeks after I showed him the positive test. I'd made my appointment at the clinic downtown, the only one within 200 miles. I'd researched everything, saved for weeks and made peace with my decision. The morning of my appointment, I pulled into the parking lot to find the usual group of protesters. They were there every Tuesday and Thursday, holding signs with graphic images, shouting at anyone who walked past. I'd seen them before. When I'd come for my initial consultation, I kept my head down, walking quickly toward the entrance. That's when I heard it, a voice that made my blood freeze. Please don't do this. Your baby deserves to live. I turned slowly, praying I was wrong. But there she was, my mother, holding a sign that said Choose Life, standing with a group she'd been volunteering with for the past year. Our eyes met. Her sign dropped to the ground. The other protesters kept shouting, but she stood frozen, her face going pale. I hadn't told her about the pregnancy. We'd barely spoken since I'd moved out at 18. Tired of her controlling every aspect of my life, she'd found her calling in church activism after dad left, throwing herself into causes that made her feel righteous. Becca, she whispered, stepping forward. The other protesters noticed The change looking between us confused. One woman asked if she knew me. Mom just stared, her mouth opening and closing like she couldn't find words. This is why I never told you. I said quiet, because I knew you'd make us about you, about your beliefs, not about what I need. She reached for me, but I stepped back. Sweetheart, let's go somewhere and talk. You don't have to do this. I can help you. We can raise the baby together. Where was the support when I needed help with college tuition? I asked. When I was working three jobs to pay rent. When dad left and you chose your church over your daughter who was begging you to just listen to me for once, the clinic escort approached asking if I was okay. Mom grabbed my arm. Don't let them poison your mind. This is murder, Rebecca. You'll regret this forever. I pulled free. You know what I regret? my mother cares more about a stranger's fetus than her own daughter, daughter's well being. You've been out here every week, haven't you? Screaming at scared women, judging them, never once thinking about their stories. I'm trying to save lives, she protested, tears streaming down her face. No, you're trying to feel important, to feel like you matter. After dad left, but you had a daughter who needed you and you chose this instead. I gestured at the signs, the angry crowd. You chose strangers over me. The Security guard stepped forward asking if there was a problem. Mom looked at him, then at me. Please, she beg. I'm your mother. You're a protester. I corrected. My mother would ask me if I'm okay, if I'm scared, if I need someone to hold my hand. She wouldn't be standing here with a sign condemning me. I want. I walked past her into the clinic. She called after me, but her fellow protesters held her back, reminding her they weren't allowed past the property line. Inside, the nurse asked if I was alright. I nodded, though my hands were shaking. Three hours later when I left, the protesters were gone, but Mom's car was still in the lot. She was sitting in the driver's seat staring at nothing. I knocked on her window. She looked up with red, swollen eyes. I'm okay, I told her. The procedure went fine. She started crying harder. I failed you, didn't I? Long before today, I sat on the curb next to her car. You did, but maybe it's not too.

Credit bills, subscriptions gone for years. I paid Lindsay's rent, covered Dad's gambling debts, handled Mom's credit cards and bought countless expense gift. I was the responsible one who always said yes when they needed money, but never really part of the family, just their walking ATM. The birthday party had 30 relatives gathered around.

Mom pretended not to hear from the kitchen, but her shoulders lifted in silent approval. Dad raised his beer and chuckled. Well, she's not wrong.

Inside was proof of everything, receipts, bank statements, payment records showing exactly how much I'd done for people who thought I was nothing. The explosion came the next morning. Dad pounded on my door at dawn, shouting about betrayal and family loyalty. Mom sent desperate texts. How could you do this to your own family? Lindsay called six times, then messaged, you think we can't live without you? Fine. See how long you last without a family. That evening, they broke into my apartment using an old key. Dad stormed in, red faced, mom behind him, both frantic about suddenly cancelled credit cards and unpayable bills. You ungrateful little troublemaker, dad snarled, stepping closer with clenched fists. Try it, I said calmly, still drying my hair from the shower. His hand trembled but didn't move. We both knew he wasn't a fighter, just a bully hiding behind words. The cards don't work, Mom's voice cracked. Lindsay can't pay bills. The mortgage bounced. Everything I paid for is over, I said. You think we need you? Dad laughed bitterly. Seems like you Do since you broke into my apartment just to beg. Dad later invited me to a football game, claiming he wanted to talk like men. When I arrived, he clutched.

I moved into my condo in 2011 and I introduced myself to my one neighbor next door to me but instantly forgot his name. We would see each other in passing for years and I would always just say hi and the casual conversation. I met my wife in 2018 from a long distance relationship. When she finally moved in with me, there was an awkward moment when I introduced her to him. I said this is my fiance and we're getting married next month. He said congratulations and nice to meet you, then walked away. She asked me what his name was and I said I have no clue. Later that day she said his name was Brad. And I was like, oh, he looks like a Brad. And she said he had no clue what my name was either, so no big deal. 2. 2 years. I used to be a club promoter and I had a guy that bought tickets for me for every event he went to. He told me his name when I first met him, but I forgot it soon after he told me. Meeting lots of people makes it hard to remember names, especially when I don't even know if I'll ever see them again. So what's the point of remembering everyone's names after a certain point? I saw him out partying often enough, but it was past the point where I could ask him his name without it being awkward. I had him saved in my phone as Sir Prince Albert since he told me about his piercing so that I'd know who was texting me if we ever texted each other. But I didn't think to add his name since I wasn't sure what it was. So that was no help. Eventually we ended up at a party together and some people walked in and asked, hey, have you seen Phil? After not remembering meeting anyone that night named Phil, I said, no, I don't think there's a Phil here. Then that guy whose name I couldn't remember came up and joined the group and said, I'm right here. Don't worry, these guys are cool. I invited them. At that moment, I finally found out his name and I played it off as, oh, okay, well, if they are your friends, then I guess it's cool if they stay and just went with it. 3. A whole school year I knew their names. I just didn't know which twin was which and they weren't identical. 4. My name is apparently Darren to this nice couple who own a restaurant in my town. My name is not Darren. I've known them for two years. We're even FB friends. They can literally see and read my name. But it's cool. I always wanted to try being a Darren. 5. I've lived in my townhouse for almost five years now and I Don't know the name of the guy who lives directly across from me. I have pretty regular interactions with most of my neighbors, but I've never talked with this one guy beyond just exchanging pleasantries while passing each other. When I moved in and first met him, I immediately forgot his name. I was almost positive he said it was Mike. So I went about four years just assuming that was probably his name, but not quite confident enough to actually call him Mike. Then a few months ago, I was talking to some other neighbors in the parking lot when he walked by and my other neighbors called out, hey. So it was confirmed that this guy's name is not, in fact, Mike. And I was relieved. I hadn't been calling him that for the past 5 years. But I immediately forgot again what his name actually is. So now all I know is that it is something other than Mike. Maybe I'll learn his name by the time I've lived here 10 years. Six, a whole date. Someone fixed us up, but my dude never told me her name, just the address. She wanted me to pick her up. I didn't have the guts to ask her name between the date. She became a longtime GF after that date and we laughed about it. 7. My nickname in college was the mayor and I had people I had known for years coming up to me at my graduation. Saying, I had no idea your name was actually Dan.

Men should absolutely start doing one. As a former cook and current welder, hand motioning. My dad refused to use hand lotion for a while and he kept getting big cracks in his knuckles. The cold would destroy his skin. He would only put lotion on when it was basically bleeding, by which point it can't really do much help. Moisturize. To steal from Bill Burr, guys, you can put lotion on places other than your weapon. It still looks brand new while the rest of you looks like an aging pirate. You need to increase the circumference of the lotion distribution. 2, going to the doctor before it's too late. I am a doctor and seriously, the wives are always dragging them in there. That was my mom with my dad. He got sick, wasn't eating enough, didn't want to go to the doctor, collapsed in the kitchen and then she had to call 911. Turned out to be sepsis and he almost passed. Married men live like five years longer than unmarried men or something like that because of their wives forcing them to be seen. 3. Squat in the shower and reach under my dude. Pro tip, use hair conditioner when shaving any body part that isn't your face. It's much better than shaving foam but does make things slipper. So be careful. Also, if you shave your butt, prepare for an unholy swamp butt. I refuse to shave my butt anymore because The grow back is horrific. Four, my husband never really did pedicures before we met and the first time I did one for him, he was in love with it. I used a scraper to get the dead skin off his heels. He calls them hooves. Haha. And he was horrified at how much came off. He'll even inspect my work now and say this toenail is a little jagged. Do want me to look a messy? He likes being pampered. I'm happy to do it for him. 5. I was trying on jeans for work the other day and I found this magical material that stretches but looks like denim. I was gushing over them and my wife laughed and said a lot of women's jeans use that material and a lot of hers are the same. Men should discover these jeans. 6. A man started carrying a satchel years ago and never looked back. I mean, Indiana Jones has one. I'm a new man. Breath stinky. Boom. Here's some gum. Headache, boom. Here's a pill. Phone dead. Boom. Here's a charger. My little bag carries so much and has saved me so many times. 7. Separate shampoo, conditioner and body wash. 8, making an effort to make their home smell nice. The way you clean, taking a shower does not actually clean your shower. Washing your bedding with more frequency, buy a few candles, etc. You will feel more relaxed at home. And clean sheets are better for Your skin and health. 9, buying clothes when they should be replaced. I see so many men with holes in their socks and shirts with stretched collars. Please just get new ones instead of putting it off. Lol. 10. Prior girlfriends and now my wife have said I should sand my feet. Calluses off his office office. I'm in work boots all day and they get dried, crack and bleed. Now I have this cheese grater thing that I use occasionally and rub lotion on my feet a few times a week. I'm happy to no longer bleed from my feet as it is quite painful to work with open sores on my feet. I do miss having Spider Man feet that had these little Velcro like hooks on them that I'd rub on her legs to annoy her while in bed. I could attach to the sheets and move them with the bottom of my feet. Hey, 11 p. Sitting down.

In August, Emily, her husband, and her two children, ages 6 and 8, were found unalived by G U N. Wounds in their home in New Hampshire. Before the unaliving, Emily was the director of operations at a chicken wing restaurant called wing it. The owner of the chains, Derek Fisher, is alleging that Emily stole $660,000 over a two year time period. Now this allegedly occurred between January of 2023 and up until July of this year. He said that they noticed there had been a lot of handwritten checks being deposited in her bank account, according to an August 11th police report. He says that he was going over his locations finances with an accountant when he found several discrepancies stemming from cash deposits that were never actually deposited into the company's account. Sure says that he tried to get answers from Emily before going to the police, but that he was generous with time because he knew that Emily's husband was battling brain cancer. Emily's third child, a toddler, was not injured and is currently staying with the family and Fisher says that anything that's left should go to that child.

And kicking them out when they insisted. My husband Tyler, had been working 18 hour days for three weeks straight. Some department at his company completely screwed up and cost them $50 million. So his team had to fix everything. I'm talking coming home at two in the morning, eating cold leftovers, showering and passing out. Some nights I'd find him literally sleeping face first in his dinner plate or passed out on the bathroom floor with the shower still running. Two nights ago, he finally stumbled through the door around midnight with this huge grin on his exhausted face. We did it, he said. Boss gave us the rest of the week off. He ate some leftover pizza, took the world's quickest shower and was snoring before his head hit the pillow. Next morning around 9, I made breakfast but let him sleep. Poor guy looked like a zombie for weeks. Around noon, my parents showed up unannounced. I'm six months pregnant, so they visit sometimes to check on me. We're sitting there having coffee when my mom asks where Tyler is. Since his truck's in the driveway, he's still sleeping, I said. My mom's face went all pinched. It's past noon. That's unacceptable with a pregnant wife. Wake him up. I explained the whole situation. Three weeks of hell. Fifty million dollar crisis. Barely any sleep. My dad just shook his head like Tyler was some lazy bum. I'm not waking him up, I said. He needs to rest. Well, if you won't do it, I will, my mom said, standing up and heading for the stairs. I jumped up and blocked her path. If you can't respect my husband getting proper sleep after three weeks of torture, then you need to leave our house now. Are you kicking us out? My dad asked, all shocked. Yes, get out! They left, all huffy and dramatic. Within an hour, my phone was blowing up, my sister texting me, I'm an ungrateful bitch. My bro

My girlfriend Taylor and I were both 20, and things had been going pretty solid between us for about eight months. She had this stepbrother, Ethan, who was 23. And honestly, the few times I'd met him before, he seemed like a normal dude. Maybe a little too friendly, but nothing that set off major alarm bells. Two weeks ago, Taylor asked if Ethan could come hang out at my place for a few hours. She said he was bringing pizza and beer, and since my parents were visiting my aunt for the weekend, I figured, why not? My little sister Mia is 15, and she was just gonna stay upstairs doing homework anyway. So they showed up around 7. Ethan had this huge grin and two cases of beer. We started drinking and playing video games, just chilling on the couch. Everything was normal for, like, an hour. Taylor was curled up next to me. Ethan was cracking jokes about the game, and I was thinking, this was actually pretty fun. Then Ethan said he needed to use the bathroom. I pointed down the hall to the one on the first floor. Taylor and I kept playing, and I didn't even notice how long he'd been gone until we heard yelling upstairs. My blood went cold. Mia never yells. We both jumped up and ran upstairs, and I found My sister standing in her doorway crying, like full on sobbing. Ethan was right there in the hallway looking all flustered and red in the face. I immediately asked Mia what happened and she could barely get the words out between sobs. She said Ethan had walked into her room even though her door was only cracked open a little. She thought maybe he was lost looking for the bathroom, so she tried to be polite and tell him it was downstairs.

I've been doing health inspections all day. It's Tuesday. I'm wearing khakis and a polo shirt. But after crawling under kitchen equipment and checking grease traps for six hours, I look pretty rough. I stop at Tony's Italian for dinner. Small family place, decent reviews. I order chicken parm to go and sit at the counter waiting. The kitchen's visible through the pass window, and I can see some serious violations. Cross contamination, improper food temps, expired dairy products. The manager, this guy, Tony junior, keeps eyeing me like I'm trouble. I'm just sitting quietly checking my phone. Hey, he finally says, walking over, you gonna order something or just take up space? I already ordered chicken farm to go. He looks me up and down. When? 10 minutes ago. Your server Maria, took my order. He calls Maria over in rapid Italian. She explains in English that, yes, I ordered and paid already. Tony junior looks annoyed. Well, sit at a table, then. And the counters for paying customers. I am a paying customer, and the tables are all full. He's getting more agitated. Look, buddy, this is a family establishment. We don't need people loitering around looking like they just rolled out of a dumpster. The other customers start looking over. An elderly couple at table 3 seems uncomfortable with his tone. I'm just waiting for my food, man. Yeah, well, wait outside. You're making my customers nervous. I glance around. Nobody. Looks nervous. Except him. Sir, I paid for my meal. I'm waiting inside until it's ready. That's when he really loses it. Listen, pal, I don't care what sob story you got. This isn't a homeless shelter. Take your business somewhere else. He's loud enough now that the whole restaurant is watching. I'm not homeless. I'm just waiting for my chicken parm. Sure you are. Maria, cancel his order and refund his money. I want this guy out of here. Maria looks mortified. Tony, he's been very polite. I don't care. Look at him. Dirty clothes, messy hair. This is exactly the kind of clientele that ruins our reputation. The elderly man at table 3 stands up. Excuse me. There's no need to be rude to this young
