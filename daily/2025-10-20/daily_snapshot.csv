She said that she loves me. She's, she said that she wanted to date, but she couldn't let anyone know. Did Marissa make you lie about this? Yeah, plenty of times. She said you have to lie or else I'm gonna have to go away. Chris remembers when his nanny told him she was having his baby. I was a little bit freaked. This photo shows him with his Newborn son Bentley. For 3 years, Chris kept the secret. Chris finally came clean to his mother, Nadine. Mom, Bentley's really my kid. No, there's no way. When the results came back in, I went through up. The nanny was charged with multiple counts of sexual battery. Florida. And was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

The 13 year old boy used a slingshot to save his sister from the kidnappers, but he was sued by the kidnappers and taken to court demanding compensation of eight thousand thousand dollars from the boy's mother. On May 10th, 13 year old Owen Burns from Michigan heard his sister's plea for help while playing video games at home. He then saw a 17 year old Terrence Coleman kidnap his 8 year old sister and drag her into the woods. He quickly grabbed the slingshot, loaded it with marbles and both of his shots hit the kidnappers. Due to pain, the kidnapper released his sister and fled the scene. It is reported that Terrence first suffered a chest injury and the severe pain made him mistakenly believe that he had been shot. Owen fired another shot, this time hitting Terence's eye and successfully saving his sister. Afterwards, Terence's family filed a lawsuit against Owen's mother because the doctor informed Terence that his right eye will be permanently blind. Terrence's family insists that he was just playing with the girl, not kidnapping. They claim that Owen caused Terrence to go blind for no reason and demand compensation of eight thousand thousand dollars. This case is still under investigation. If he wasn't kidnapping, why did he take someone else's child into the woods and run away?

The 13 year old boy used a slingshot to save his sister from the kidnappers, but he was sued by the kidnappers and taken to court demanding compensation of eight thousand thousand dollars from the boy's mother. On May 10th, 13 year old Owen Burns from Michigan heard his sister's plea for help while playing video games at home. He then saw a 17 year old Terrence Coleman kidnap his 8 year old sister and drag her into the woods. He quickly grabbed the slingshot, loaded it with marbles and both of his shots hit the kidnappers. Due to pain, the kidnapper released his sister and fled the scene. It is reported that Terrence first suffered a chest injury and the severe pain made him mistakenly believe that he had been shot. Owen fired another shot, this time hitting Terence's eye and successfully saving his sister. Afterwards, Terence's family filed a lawsuit against Owen's mother because the doctor informed Terence that his right eye will be permanently blind. Terrence's family insists that he was just playing with the girl, not kidnapping. They claim that Owen caused Terrence to go blind for no reason and demand compensation of eight thousand thousand dollars. This case is still under investigation. If he wasn't kidnapping, why did he take someone else's child into the woods and run away?

So he gets a taxi as quickly as possible to a nearby repair shop where they charge him 12 dollars to fix his guitar. he called the airline the next day to ask them to pay for the repairs, but they refuse, telling him that it's too, too late now because he should have filed a complaint the day it happened, which he tried to do. So that's when he decided it was time to get revenge. He got a few of his friends together to write a song dissing United Airlines, thinking it would just be a funny joke. But although the airline wasn't concerned about the song at first, it suddenly started to get attention. So they freaked out, then told him they would pay the 12 if he took the song down.

Got chalked at 8:30. I came back at 12:30. The truck marks are still on it. So I wrote it for a two hour violation. But Brennan is violating the Constitution Michigan who argued that marking tires is similar to police secretly putting a GPS on a vehicle without a proper warrant. That's a violation of the 4th Amendment right against unreasonable searches. I don't mind at all. I think it's a chalk wipes off very, very easily. So it's not a problem. The court, which covers four Midwest states, ruled that now a warrant is needed because the purpose of marking tires is to raise revenue and not for public safety. Ken Kissell, who owns Livewire Security in Irvington, says the chalking keeps three spots open for customers. So somebody can run in, run out and not have to worry about getting a ticket for just being parked for 5 minutes like you do with a lot of other towns that have parking meters. In the meantime, the village is considering more high tech options.

A man picked up his wife and threw her towards the TV like a rag doll while she desperately begged, please don't do this. All of this happened in front of their five month old child who witnessed the entire scene but was powerless to intervene, leaving an indelible traumatic memory. The man is 31 year old Zach Stacy, a former New York Jets running back. Later he was only sentenced to one month in prison after admitting to the crime of criminal injury. The newly exposed video shows the severity of the incident where they had a heated argument over a rent payment issue. His wife Kristen Evans attempted to escape, but he chased after her and used a trash can to smash the car, even grabbing the car's wiper. According to a home surveillance video, Zack first hit Evans twice on the back of the head with an unidentified object and picked him up and threw him heavily towards the TV. Please, please, please. Evans can be heard constantly pleading with him to stop. Even in front of their 5 month old child, Zack continues to commit violence. Afterwards, Evans said in an interview that she didn't want Zach to stay in prison for even a day. No one wants to send their son's father to prison. Zach was charged with serious assault and criminal damage and sentenced to one month in prison. At present, this mother and son are receiving psychological and legal support. Do you think he should not go to jail?

Yeah, let's be honest, man. That's up to you. How do you want the car to feel when you boost it? Well, obviously I want the car to be faster. Yeah, but do you want it to be smooth, fast, or do you not mind waiting a second or two and then taking off? Hold up. I'm confused. What are you talking about? Turbo chargers work off the exhaust gas, meaning you had to build up enough exhaust gas to spin the turbine. That's what we call boost lag. Oh, okay. Is there any way to get rid of boost lag? Well, you could run anti lag, which would be more expensive and of course you run the risk of blowing up your motor. But if you don't have anti lag, you could also break boost. What's that? When you step on the brakes and the gas at the same time to build up pressure. So when you let off the brakes, you'll already be in boost, but of course that'll put a lot of stress on your brakes. Okay, I see what you're saying. What about the other one you mentioned? Well, your car is na right now. Tossing a supercharger on would be the best way to gain power while still retaining good throttle response. There's no lag really at all. Ah, superchargers are belt driven. Low RPMs equals low boost. Higher RPMs equals high boost, not To mention it makes your car sound like an airplane. There's also twin charging, but I know you can't afford that. Twin charging, what's that? That's when you got a turbo and a supercharger. Wow.

Uh, why are you asking? Well, I was watching fast and furious, and every single time someone's about to lose, they hit this red button that says NOS, and then next thing you know, the car is going way faster than it ever did. What exactly are they doing, and how do I do it to my car? Well, first of all, you absolutely don't need it on your car, but I'll tell you how it works. Okay, fair enough. So, NOS stands for Nitrous Oxide System. You remember those blue bottles they would show hidden in the trunk or under the seats? Yeah. Looked pretty cool. Well, those are NOS bottles, and inside those bottles, it's nitrous oxide, but in its liquid form. Often times, people think NOS is a different type of gasoline that makes your car go faster. Wait, it's not? No, but it does work in unison with your gasoline. Wait, dad, I'm kind of confused. Well, remember the basic principles of an engine? Air, fuel, spark, and compression. Yeah, I got that. Well, some people have their system set up so when they hit that button, it shoots nitrous into the cylinders or into the intake manifold. And again, it's liquid when it's in the bottle, but when it goes into the engine, it's no longer liquid. So it's air. Yeah, exactly. It's boost, but without turbo chargers or superchargers. Of course, you can still run nitrous on

I took a screenshot of the listing and everything. Facebook Marketplace. I'm telling you, wow, it's pretty amazing. Where'd you get those wheels from? They're pretty clean. Oh, I got those for 700 on Facebook Marketplace. Wow, that's really good with tires. Wow. That's amazing. I'm telling you, man, you'll find a lot of good things for cheap on there, bro. I search it every single day and I don't come across half the amount of finds that you do. What's the secret? Do you have a different location or something? I don't know. I just be finding things. Where'd you find the roll cage at? Oh, I got that for 200 on Facebook Marketplace and then I just spray painted it at home. Looks pretty nice, huh? Yeah, looks legit. That's a nice color. Is it paint or wrap? Oh, that's paint. I found this ad on Facebook Marketplace and they said you're doing paint jobs for $600. I was a little skeptical, but it came out pretty nice. I know you have favorites. What about that body key?

I found the messages with her coworker. I waited until their company merger went live, then sent the screenshots to the press. She said it on a Sunday morning over coffee. I've fallen out of love with you. Sunlight through the kitchen window, French roast in the air. Six years together, engaged for eight months. I set down my mug. What? I don't feel it anymore, she said. Eyes her spoon. I think we should end things. My chest went tight. Is there someone else? No, too fast. I just need to be honest with myself. With us. She stirred sugar into her coffee. She'd never liked it. Sweet, okay, I said. Her eyes flicked up, surprised, like she expected me to beg. Okay, if that's how you feel. She moved out that week, took her clothes, her books, half the furniture. I helped her pack. Calm, polite, like we were co workers ending a project. She kept saying she was sorry, that she hoped we could stay friends. I just nodded. The nights after she left were long and silent. I, I couldn't sleep. Just lay there replaying everything frame by frame. Then I remembered her laptop. We shared passwords, devices, accounts. She'd never changed them. I opened her messages and there it was. Months of texts with someone named Marcus, her coworker, just a friend from the office. The messages started friendly, then flirty, then explicit. I can't stop thinking about You last night was incredible. When can we do it again? I scrolled up, trace the timeline. It started four months ago, right when she got busy with work. The night she cancelled our venue visit. She'd been with him. I kept reading, then saw the most recent messages. The merger goes live next month. After that, we can finally be public. Can't wait. No more hiding. The merger, the one she'd been talking about non stop. Marcus VP at the competing company. I sat back, hands shaking, then breathing, then still. I closed the laptop and started planning. For three weeks, I said nothing. Didn't reply to her checking in texts, didn't ask about Marcus, but I was collecting screenshots of every message, every photo, every time stamp. Found out Marcus was married, two kids, his wife's Instagram full of family vacations. I checked his company's ethics policy, relationships between executives forbidden. He signed a morality clause. Scandal equals termination. Perfect. I compiled it all, a neat folder of destruction. Then I waited. The merger announcement was October 15th. Huge press event. Both CEOs, executives from both sides, my ex, Marcus cameras, live streams. A week before she texted me, hey, I know this is weird, but I wanted you to know I'm seeing someone. I hope that's okay. I typed back, that's great. I'm happy for you. She sent a heart emoji. October 15th, I woke early, made coffee, opened my laptop, pulled up emails for three business reporters covering The merger typed one short message, thought you should know about an ethics violation involving two executives at today's merger announcement. Screenshots attached, attached everything. The next, the photos, the timeline. Marcus's claws, his wife's Instagram hit send. 8:00am press conference 10, I turned on the live stream. At 9:55, the ballroom gleamed. Glass podium, corporate banners, flashing cameras. My ex stood to the right in a navy suit, Marcus beside her, confident, perfect. The CEO started his speech. Growth projections, shared vision, synergy. At 10:23, a journalist raised his hand. Excuse me, I have a question about an internal ethics matter. The room quieted. Can you comment on the romantic relationship between two executives here today? He said their names. My ex froze. Marcus's smile vanished. The CEO blinked. What are you referring to? The reporter lifted his phone. We've received explicit messages between them dating back months. It violates both company's ethics codes. Another journalist stood. And Marcus's morality clause signed last year that would void his position. Correct. The CEO's expression turned to stone. He turned to them. Is this true? Marcus stammered. We, it's not. My ex just stood there, eyes wide. The chat feed blew up. Thousands watching live. The CEO whispered to his assistant. Security stepped forward. Sir, ma'am, please come with us, one reporter called out. We've also confirmed Marcus is married, two children. Gasps from the room. Marcus went red. My ex looked like she might faint. The CEO face the cameras. This press conference is over. We will investigate these allegations immediately. The feed cut out. By noon, it was everywhere. Merger implodes amid executive affair scandal. VP fired for violating morality clause. Marcus terminated. My ex spended under review. The merger postponed indefinitely. My phone buzzed non stop. Unknown numbers, reporters asking for comments. I turned it off. That evening she called from another number. I let it ring. Her voicemail, drew, please, I know it was you. You ruined my life, my career, everything. I deleted it. Full story on the channel linked below.

I found the messages with her coworker. I waited until their company merger went live, then sent the screenshots to the press. She said it on a Sunday morning over coffee. I've fallen out of love with you. Sunlight through the kitchen window. French roast in the air. Six years together. Engaged for eight months. I set down my mug. What? I don't feel it anymore, she said. Eyes, her spoon. I think we should end things. My chest went tight. Is there someone else? No. Too fast. I just need to be honest with myself. With us. She stirred sugar into her coffee. She'd never liked it sweet. Okay, I said. Her eyes flicked up, surprised, like she expected me to beg. Okay, if that's how you feel. She moved out that week. Took her clothes, her books, half the furniture. I helped her pack. Calm, polite, like we were co workers ending a project. She kept saying she was sorry, that she hoped we could stay friends. I just nodded. The nights after she left were long and silent. I couldn't sleep. Just lay there, replaying everything frame by frame. Then I remembered her laptop. We shared passwords, devices, accounts. She'd never changed them. I opened her messages, and there it was. Months of texts with someone named Marcus. Her coworker. Just a friend from the office. The messages started friendly, then flirty, then explicit. I can't stop thinking about you, Last night was incredible. When can we do it again? I scrolled up, trace the timeline. It started four months ago, right when she got busy with work. The night she canceled our venue visit. She'd been with him. I kept reading, then saw the most recent messages. Merger goes live next month. After that, we can finally be public. Can't wait. No more hiding. The merger. The one she'd been talking about non stop. Marcus. VP at the competing company. I sat back, hands shaking, then breathing. Then still. I closed the laptop and started planning. For three weeks, I said nothing. Didn't reply to her, checking in texts, didn't ask about Marcus. But I was collecting screenshots of every message, every photo, every time stamp. Found out Marcus was married. Two kids, his wife's Instagram full of family vacations. I checked his company's ethics policy. Relationships between executives forbidden. He signed a morality clause. Scandal equals termination. Perfect. I compiled it all. A neat folder of destruction. Then I waited. The merger announcement was October 15th. Huge press event. Both CEOs, executives from both sides. My ex market.

So there's this guy in my grade who's basically allergic to not being the center of attention, like physically cannot handle not being the main character of every situation. He's the type who'd light his shoes on fire if he thought it would get him 5 seconds of fame. Last year, he literally jumped out of a second story window during lunch to impress some girl he barely knew, broke his ankle in three places, got suspended for a month. We all figured that would be his wake up call, you know, like maybe almost breaking his entire leg would teach him that attention isn't worth permanent damage. It didn't. First day back from suspension and he walked into school like he'd won a medal. Everyone was talking about the window thing and you could tell he was loving every second. He had this huge boot on his foot and was milking it for everything it was worth. By third period, I already had a bad feeling about what was coming next. Fast forward to sixth period art class. It's right after lunch. Everyone's half asleep and our teacher is this older lady who's way too trusting for her own good. She leaves the room constantly. This particular day she stepped out to grab more supplies from the storage closet down the hall. The second, and I mean the exact second, that door Clicked shut. This kid's eyes light up. He looks around the room with this expression like he just discovered fire. Then he reaches across the table and grabs two tubes of acrylic paint, bright blue, holds them up over his head like trophies and announces to the entire class, 20 bucks as I can drink both of these right now. The room explodes. Everyone's immediately yelling at him, dude, no, that's literal poison. You're gonna die. But he's already got this grin on his face. I realize with complete horror that he's not joking. This is actually happening. He unscrews the cap off the first tube while we're all still protesting. I legitimately thought he was bluffing like this was some elaborate bit and he chicken out at the last second. He didn't. He tilted his head back, opened his mouth and squeeze that entire tube of paint straight down his throat like it was a go gurt. Bright blue paint. I watched it disappear. The whole class went silent, just staring in disbelief. Then he wiped his mouth, grabbed the second tube and did it again. For a moment, nothing happened. He's standing there.
