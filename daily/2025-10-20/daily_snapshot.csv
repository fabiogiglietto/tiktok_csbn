But after a judge sentenced him to 13 years in prison, when it was time to go to jail, no police came to get him. He didn't try to run away because he knew he deserved it, so he just nervously waited in his house, expecting police to show up at any moment. But. But after a few weeks had passed, they never came, so he thought they may have just cleared his record. So over the next few years, he moved on with his life, completely forgetting about the incident. He got married, launched a construction company, and volunteered to help youth avoid making the same mistakes he made. But 13 years later, he was shocked when police suddenly arrived at his house to arrest him. It turns out because of a technical issue, police thought he was in jail for the last 13 years, but when they went to release him, they realized he wasn't there, so they sent police to immediately arrest him. He was devastated when they told him he now had to spend 13 years in prison to serve his sentence. when the judge saw that Michael had completely turned his life around and rehabilitated himself, he set him free with no jail time.

This photo shows him with his Newborn son, Bentley. For three years, Chris kept the secret. Chris finally came clean to his mother, Nadine. Mom, Bentley's really my kid. No, there's no way. When the results came back in, I went and threw up. The nanny was charged with multiple counts of sexual battery. Florida and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Mom! 93 year old Juanita Fitzgerald refused to leave the nursing home where she lived after receiving the eviction notice. Fitzgerald is a resident of Franklin House, a residential community operated by National Church Residences, where she has lived since 2,011. It was reported that she thought she wouldn't live long and thus stopped paying the rent. However, Fitzgerald claimed that the nursing home refused to accept her payment. The National Church Apartments said that Fitzgerald had complained of mold in her apartment, but it was reported that no mold was found in the tests. Despite the many efforts made by the authorities and social service agencies to assist her, including contacting her family in Tennessee, Fitzgerald rejected all the offers for help. When the authorities attempted to carry out the deportation, the elderly woman fought back vigorously, saying, I'm not going anywhere unless you carry me out.

Due to pain, the kidnapper released his sister and fled the scene. It is reported that Terrence first suffered a chest injury and the severe pain made him mistakenly believe that he had been shot. Owen fired another shot, this time hitting Terence's eye and successfully saving his sister.

Got chalked at 8:30. I came back at 12:30. The truck marks are still on it. So I wrote it for a two hour violation. But Brennan is violating the Constitution Michigan who argued that marking tires is similar to police secretly putting a GPS on a vehicle without a proper warrant. That's a violation of the 4th Amendment right against unreasonable searches. I don't mind at all. I think it's a chalk wipes off very, very easily. So it's not a problem. The court, which covers four Midwest states, ruled that now a warrant is needed because the purpose of marking tires is to raise revenue and not for public safety. Ken Kissell, who owns Livewire Security in Irvington, says the chalking keeps three spots open for customers. So somebody can run in, run out and not have to worry about getting a ticket for just being parked for 5 minutes like you do with a lot of other towns that have parking meters. In the meantime, the village is considering more high tech options.

After she pushed the suspect to the ground, her daughter also ran over and helped hold him down until the police arrived. And she did a good job.

A mother in Georgia deliberately killed her two toddlers, put them in the oven and turned it on for 45 minutes on October 18th, when Father Jamuel Penn returned and didn't see the children and when he Learned from mother Lemora Williams that it was she who put the children in the oven, he broke down. He rushed into the kitchen and called 9, 1, 1. When he brought out the one year old Jakarta Penn and the two year old coyote Penn, they had already lost their lives. When the police arrived, they found the deceased children outside the apartment and immediately arrested their mother. Lamora told the police that she didn't know who killed her child. Then she blamed the crime on her cousin. Finally, she, she said that her sister had killed the children. She wasn't clear and provided false information. Lamoreaux Williams, 24, was charged with two counts of murder. Husband said that she had mental problems. He also submitted a letter of forgiveness to her. After assessment, it was confirmed that Lamora Williams has cognitive impairment. Finally, the judge sentenced her to five years in prison. Do you think such a verdict is fair?

Yeah, let's be honest, man. That's up to you. How do you want the car to feel when you boost it? Well, obviously I want the car to be faster. Yeah, but do you want it to be smooth, fast, or do you not mind waiting a second or two and then taking off? Hold up. I'm confused. What are you talking about? Turbo chargers work off the exhaust gas, meaning you had to build up enough exhaust gas to spin the turbine. That's what we call boost lag. Oh, okay. Is there any way to get rid of boost lag? Well, you could run anti lag, which would be more expensive and of course you run the risk of blowing up your motor. But if you don't have anti lag, you could also break boost. What's that? When you step on the brakes and the gas at the same time to build up pressure. So when you let off the brakes, you'll already be in boost, but of course that'll put a lot of stress on your brakes. Okay, I see what you're saying. What about the other one you mentioned? Well, your car is na right now. Tossing a supercharger on would be the best way to gain power while still retaining good throttle response. There's no lag really at all. Ah, superchargers are belt driven. Low RPMs equals low boost. Higher RPMs equals high boost, not To mention it makes your car sound like an airplane. There's also twin charging, but I know you can't afford that. Twin charging, what's that? That's when you got a turbo and a supercharger. Wow.

Uh, why are you asking? Well, I was watching fast and furious, and every single time someone's about to lose, they hit this red button that says NOS, and then next thing you know, the car is going way faster than it ever did. What exactly are they doing, and how do I do it to my car? Well, first of all, you absolutely don't need it on your car, but I'll tell you how it works. Okay, fair enough. So, NOS stands for Nitrous Oxide System. You remember those blue bottles they would show hidden in the trunk or under the seats? Yeah. Looked pretty cool. Well, those are NOS bottles, and inside those bottles, it's nitrous oxide, but in its liquid form. Often times, people think NOS is a different type of gasoline that makes your car go faster. Wait, it's not? No, but it does work in unison with your gasoline. Wait, dad, I'm kind of confused. Well, remember the basic principles of an engine? Air, fuel, spark, and compression. Yeah, I got that. Well, some people have their system set up so when they hit that button, it shoots nitrous into the cylinders or into the intake manifold. And again, it's liquid when it's in the bottle, but when it goes into the engine, it's no longer liquid. So it's air. Yeah, exactly. It's boost, but without turbo chargers or superchargers. Of course, you can still run nitrous on

I found the messages with her coworker. I waited until their company merger went live, then sent the screenshots to the press. She said it on a Sunday morning over coffee. I've fallen out of love with you. Sunlight through the kitchen window, French roast in the air. Six years together, engaged for eight months. I set down my mug. What? I don't feel it anymore, she said. Eyes her spoon. I think we should end things. My chest went tight. Is there someone else? No, too fast. I just need to be honest with myself. With us. She stirred sugar into her coffee. She'd never liked it. Sweet, okay, I said. Her eyes flicked up, surprised, like she expected me to beg. Okay, if that's how you feel. She moved out that week, took her clothes, her books, half the furniture. I helped her pack. Calm, polite, like we were co workers ending a project. She kept saying she was sorry, that she hoped we could stay friends. I just nodded. The nights after she left were long and silent. I, I couldn't sleep. Just lay there replaying everything frame by frame. Then I remembered her laptop. We shared passwords, devices, accounts. She'd never changed them. I opened her messages and there it was. Months of texts with someone named Marcus, her coworker, just a friend from the office. The messages started friendly, then flirty, then explicit. I can't stop thinking about You last night was incredible. When can we do it again? I scrolled up, trace the timeline. It started four months ago, right when she got busy with work. The night she cancelled our venue visit. She'd been with him. I kept reading, then saw the most recent messages. The merger goes live next month. After that, we can finally be public. Can't wait. No more hiding. The merger, the one she'd been talking about non stop. Marcus VP at the competing company. I sat back, hands shaking, then breathing, then still. I closed the laptop and started planning. For three weeks, I said nothing. Didn't reply to her checking in texts, didn't ask about Marcus, but I was collecting screenshots of every message, every photo, every time stamp. Found out Marcus was married, two kids, his wife's Instagram full of family vacations. I checked his company's ethics policy, relationships between executives forbidden. He signed a morality clause. Scandal equals termination. Perfect. I compiled it all, a neat folder of destruction. Then I waited. The merger announcement was October 15th. Huge press event. Both CEOs, executives from both sides, my ex, Marcus cameras, live streams. A week before she texted me, hey, I know this is weird, but I wanted you to know I'm seeing someone. I hope that's okay. I typed back, that's great. I'm happy for you. She sent a heart emoji. October 15th, I woke early, made coffee, opened my laptop, pulled up emails for three business reporters covering The merger typed one short message, thought you should know about an ethics violation involving two executives at today's merger announcement. Screenshots attached, attached everything. The next, the photos, the timeline. Marcus's claws, his wife's Instagram hit send. 8:00am press conference 10, I turned on the live stream. At 9:55, the ballroom gleamed. Glass podium, corporate banners, flashing cameras. My ex stood to the right in a navy suit, Marcus beside her, confident, perfect. The CEO started his speech. Growth projections, shared vision, synergy. At 10:23, a journalist raised his hand. Excuse me, I have a question about an internal ethics matter. The room quieted. Can you comment on the romantic relationship between two executives here today? He said their names. My ex froze. Marcus's smile vanished. The CEO blinked. What are you referring to? The reporter lifted his phone. We've received explicit messages between them dating back months. It violates both company's ethics codes. Another journalist stood. And Marcus's morality clause signed last year that would void his position. Correct. The CEO's expression turned to stone. He turned to them. Is this true? Marcus stammered. We, it's not. My ex just stood there, eyes wide. The chat feed blew up. Thousands watching live. The CEO whispered to his assistant. Security stepped forward. Sir, ma'am, please come with us, one reporter called out. We've also confirmed Marcus is married, two children. Gasps from the room. Marcus went red. My ex looked like she might faint. The CEO face the cameras. This press conference is over. We will investigate these allegations immediately. The feed cut out. By noon, it was everywhere. Merger implodes amid executive affair scandal. VP fired for violating morality clause. Marcus terminated. My ex spended under review. The merger postponed indefinitely. My phone buzzed non stop. Unknown numbers, reporters asking for comments. I turned it off. That evening she called from another number. I let it ring. Her voicemail, drew, please, I know it was you. You ruined my life, my career, everything. I deleted it. Full story on the channel linked below.

So there's this guy in my grade who's basically allergic to not being the center of attention, like physically cannot handle not being the main character of every situation. He's the type who'd light his shoes on fire if he thought it would get him 5 seconds of fame. Last year, he literally jumped out of a second story window during lunch to impress some girl he barely knew, broke his ankle in three places, got suspended for a month. We all figured that would be his wake up call, you know, like maybe almost breaking his entire leg would teach him that attention isn't worth permanent damage. It didn't. First day back from suspension and he walked into school like he'd won a medal. Everyone was talking about the window thing and you could tell he was loving every second. He had this huge boot on his foot and was milking it for everything it was worth. By third period, I already had a bad feeling about what was coming next. Fast forward to sixth period art class. It's right after lunch. Everyone's half asleep and our teacher is this older lady who's way too trusting for her own good. She leaves the room constantly. This particular day she stepped out to grab more supplies from the storage closet down the hall. The second, and I mean the exact second, that door Clicked shut. This kid's eyes light up. He looks around the room with this expression like he just discovered fire. Then he reaches across the table and grabs two tubes of acrylic paint, bright blue, holds them up over his head like trophies and announces to the entire class, 20 bucks as I can drink both of these right now. The room explodes. Everyone's immediately yelling at him, dude, no, that's literal poison. You're gonna die. But he's already got this grin on his face. I realize with complete horror that he's not joking. This is actually happening. He unscrews the cap off the first tube while we're all still protesting. I legitimately thought he was bluffing like this was some elaborate bit and he chicken out at the last second. He didn't. He tilted his head back, opened his mouth and squeeze that entire tube of paint straight down his throat like it was a go gurt. Bright blue paint. I watched it disappear. The whole class went silent, just staring in disbelief. Then he wiped his mouth, grabbed the second tube and did it again. For a moment, nothing happened. He's standing there.
