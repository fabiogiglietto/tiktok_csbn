My family had one rule. Marry the right gender, give us biological grandchildren. When my brother brought home Carlos, a pediatric surgeon who literally saves babies for a living, my parents smiled politely through dinner and told him to leave and never come back. Nice man, wrong parts, mother said. Can't make real grandchildren. My brother chose Carlos, and they disowned him. That night, they drained his bank accounts while he slept. They were still co signers from when he was 17. Canceled his health insurance effective immediately. Reported his car stolen since it was a graduation gift still in their name. By morning, his medical practice received a cease and desist letter for using our family name. I even saw his baby photos in the garbage. I was 22. Watched from my bedroom window as he loaded what little he actually owned into Carlos's car at 9:00am. My parents stood in the doorway, like my father had already posted on Facebook that our family was mourning a loss. By morning, 500 people had sent condolences for my brother's death from cancer. I wanted to help, but my father pulled me aside. You walk out that door, you're dead, too. And I'll make sure you never finish medical school. Scared. But I knew what I had to do. Three years I played the perfect son. Dated girls whose families thought the same. Pharmaceutical heiresses, senators, daughters, old money families with The right chromosomes to continue the bloodline. Sent my parents photos of every approved girlfriend, like breeding certificates. I attended monthly family foundation meetings where my brother's name was never spoken. His face already photoshopped out of family portraits and replaced with our cousins. Meanwhile, I had a secret phone. Called my brother every Sunday. He was happy. Really happy. Carlos treated him like gold. It fostered three kids. Siblings the system couldn't keep to together. Kids whose biological families had thrown them away like trash. Two had been abandoned at the hospital. One had lived in five different homes by age 7. I miss you, he'd say. I miss you, too. Graduate first. Get your trust fund vested. Then we'll figure it out. I took his advice.

From age 5 onwards, my mom would inspect every meal, snack and candy like a food inspector. Red apples, strawberries, cherry popsicles, red skittles, all banned. Even ketchup was replaced with mustard or Mayo. If I accidentally grabbed something red at school lunch, she'd get a call from the nurse within hours. Emergency food allergy protocol, they'd say. Even though I'd never shown any allergic reactions, my mom would rush to school with Benadryl and panic in her eyes. The rule was absolutely insane. At birthday parties, I'd watch kids eat red velvet cake while I got stuck with vanilla. Halloween was torture. All the best candy was off limits. Friends thought I had some rare medical condition and honestly, so did I. I begged for explanations constantly. Just tell me what happens if I eat something red. But mom would just say something vague about your system can't handle it or we need to be careful. Made zero sense when I could eat orange, yellow, purple, literally every other colour. The worst part was feeling like a freak. Everywhere I went, while other kids casually grabbed red foods, I had to read every ingredient list and interrogate cafeteria workers. Teachers started keeping special safe snacks just for me. College was pure rebellion. I ate strawberries, cherry pie, red peppers, everything I'd been denied for 13 years. Nothing happened. No allergic reactions, no mysterious illness. I was furious. My parents had lied about A fake medical condition my entire childhood. But junior year, I brought my roommate Sarah home for Thanksgiving. She thought the red food thing was outdated parenting. My mom used to ban artificial colors, too, she said, super common in the 90s. The first day seemed normal. I avoided red foods out of habit and my parents seemed relieved I was still being careful. Sarah even complimented how natural and healthy all our meals were. But the second morning, I was making breakfast and casually grabbed a red apple in the fruit bowl. The moment my mom saw me holding it, she went completely white and slapped it out of my hands so hard it splattered against the wall. Never eat anything.

My neighbor Tom was always bringing over cookies and offering to help with yard work. something felt off about the way he looked at my 9 year old daughter Amy. Tom would come over with these homemade chocolate chip cookies every other week. Amy would get so excited running to the door when she saw him coming up the walkway. He always kneel down to her level, give her these long hugs that lasted way too long, made my skin crawl. But I couldn't put my finger on why. My wife thought I was being paranoid. He's just being nice, Jake. Not everyone has bad intentions. One day Amy came inside after talking to Tom by the mailbox. She seemed quiet, different. When I asked what they talked about, she just shrugged and said Tom told her she looked pretty in her new pink dress. That's when I realized something was seriously wrong. Amy had changed clothes twice that morning and settled on that pink dress right before going outside. How did Tom know it was new? I started paying closer attention. Tom would always find excuses to come over when Amy was playing in the front yard. He'd linger by the fence making small talk while watching her on the swing set. Started timing his walks perfectly with her school bus arrival. Always happened to be getting his mail right when she got home. The breaking point? Came when my wife left her phone on the kitchen counter while she was upstairs. A text popped up and I glanced over, expecting it to be her sister or something. Instead, I saw, she looks like a little angel in that blue dress today. Tell her I said hi. The message was from Tom.

But her face immediately dropped when she realised that we tricked her. My sister in law, Maya, has always been competitive with me since the day I married her brother, Jake. She couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, I tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me. And from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd discuss, she'd push harder. Come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nurse free and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail when she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages desperately searching for any Evidence of our name decision, my husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use first. She wouldn't do that, he said, but I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created blank interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with Final Decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition and I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think, she'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived. The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to her Surprise. The next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness when I walked into her room. She actually had the audacity to say, I hope you don't mind that we ended up using Aurora when she was born. It just felt so right for our daughter. I know you guys were considering it, too. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed her our real pic.

I remember when I was really little, my sister and I used to sit in our room and wait for our older brother to bring us food. This was our favorite part of the day because he'd sneak in late at night with candy, cheese and bread for us. Sometimes he didn't come back until it was really late. So we'd all sit on the floor and eat really quietly to not wake our parents up. I thought it was just for fun and so we could eat candy. But I just found out what was really going on. I'm now 15 and we're all adopted. Earlier, I told my brother how fun it used to be when we'd eat snacks late at night while nobody knew. But he looked really confused. Apparently, it wasn't fun for him at all and he only did it because he had to. Turns out, while I thought they were from our pantry, he was actually sneaking out while our parents didn't know and stealing food from a grocery store so we wouldn't starve. He was 7 and knew we weren't being fed, so he had to steal food almost every night until he got caught. Night he did, the store owner actually started crying because he knew who our parents were and he didn't even know they had kids. He was horrified to find out there were three of us living. In that house and started giving him food to take home. That man probably saved our lives.

When my mom found out she was pregnant with me, my dad suddenly disappeared while she was sleeping that night. He left her with all the bills to pay and now a child to take care of by herself in New York. She was really stressed, and while she was silently crying outside of a Starbucks, a guy in a suit asked if she was okay. She explained what happened, and he felt so bad for her. He asked if she needed a job. This would have made her a lot of money and was probably her only chance at the time. She had an interview a few weeks later and was really nervous, but for some reason, the power went out in her building that night. He woke up really late the next morning and started trying to rush to the train station. She got there and had just missed the train by 30 seconds. She felt defeated and called to ask if she could come later, but they just told her not to because she wasn't getting the job if she couldn't even show up on time. She was so stressed out, she just went home and cried before falling asleep. Four hours later, she woke up to someone pounding on her door and opened it to see my aunt crying. She hugged my mom and was so worried because she wasn't answering her phone and thought she was dead. It turns out, since the our had gone out in her building that night, and since her alarm didn't go off that morning, she didn't go to one of the twin towers for her interview that day. That was the day the planes hit, and we both would have died.

Is Daisy Williams present in school today? My teacher, Missus Harra, clicked the intercom button. Yes. The principal's voice echoed, lockdown, now! This is not a drill. The way he said it made my blood freeze. Missus Harra shrieked under the desks. Lights off! Move, move, move! Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. I couldn't help but think he was after me. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Missus Harra tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. Screaming got louder, and it wasn't just one voice anymore. Multiple people in different parts of the building. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that the shooter was right outside. And I believed them. Pia grabbed my hand, and her palms were soaked with sweat. I could see Mister Kids class across the hall through our door window. Lights already off. No movement. Just darkness. Where 20 kids should have been. I looked at our teacher, and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids, and told us it would be okay. But after a while, she Got up again and walked back to her laptop. Then we heard it. Footsteps running past our door. Thud! Thud, thud! I couldn't help myself. I had to look. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall, pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops. Get away from the door, Daisy! Missus Harrah whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Even missus Harrah stood up slowly and crept to the door to check the window before opening it. That's when it flung open. The principal stood there with an actual cop who had his hand resting on his gun. You, Daisy, come with us. Immediately my worst fear confirmed. The tutor had sent them. Or maybe they thought I was involved somehow. Missus Harra looked between them and me, confused. Get your things, honey, missus Harra said. And that scared me more than anything, because in three years of chemistry class, she'd never called me honey. Every single person was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack with shaking hands. The hallway was complete chaos, more cops than I'd ever seen. In one place, I heard a paramedic shout, we're losing him! Move! As he flew past us. My classmates were pressed against the door windows in every room, watching me get escorted by police like I was a criminal. They steered me to the main office, but passed reception into the Conference room. The cop finally spoke. Your dad is here? Well, my parents are divorced, and I hadn't seen him since I was seven. So now I was really confused. Dad? He grabbed me in a hug so tight, I couldn't breathe, and his whole body shook against mine. I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. My ex marine father, who always encouraged me to be stoic and suppress my feelings, was crying his eyes out. Sorry for what? What's happening? Is there a shooter? Are people dead? I pulled back to look at him, and he held my face in both hands. His hands were freezing. There's no

So there's this kid at school named Ben who thinks he's some kind of tech genius. He's always bragging about how he can hack into anything and showing off with his fancy coding skills. Most people just ignore him, but he made the mistake of targeting me last month. I was sitting in the library working on an essay when Ben comes over and starts looking at my laptop screen. I had Spotify open in another tab because I was listening to music while I worked. Starts laughing and says my playlist is trash and asks if he can show me some real music. I said no thanks and went back to my work, but Ben doesn't take no for an answer. He pulls out his phone and starts typing away and suddenly my Spotify starts skipping songs. Then it switches to some death metal band I've never heard of. I look at him and he's got this smug grin on his face, whispers that he's connected to my account and can control it from his phone. Then he starts blasting the volume up and down just to mess with me. The librarian comes over and tells me to keep it down, which was embarrassing because everyone was staring. I told Ben to stop, but he just kept going. He changed my playlist name to something stupid and started adding weird songs to it. When I tried to change it back on my laptop, he Would just override it from his phone. It was like playing tug of war with my own account. The worst part was when he started following random people on my account and liking their playlists. Some of them were really inappropriate ones with explicit names. I was mortified because all my friends could see this stuff in their activity feed. After about 20 minutes of this torture, I finally had enough. I grabbed my stuff and left the library. But even at home he was still messing with my account. Songs would randomly start playing in the middle of the night, or my playlists would get deleted and recreated with terrible music. This went on for three days. Ben would walk past me in the hallway and smirk, knowing he had complete control over my Spotify. He even changed my profile picture to some meme of a crying baby. I tried changing my password, but somehow he still had access. That's when I came up with my plan. I did some research and found out that Spotify has a feature where you can report unauthorized access to your account. But I wanted to do more than just get him kicked off. I started documenting everything. I took screenshots of him changing my playlists, recorded videos of songs suddenly switching while I was using the app, and even got my friend to witness him controlling my music from across the classroom. Then I found out something interesting. Ben had been bragging To other people about hacking. Not just my account, but several other students accounts, too. He thought it was hilarious that he could mess with people's music and make them look stupid. So I reached out to those other kids and found out they had the same experience. Random music playing at inappropriate times, embarrassing songs showing up in their recent activity playlists, getting messed with. Some of them had even gotten in trouble with their parents when explicit songs started playing through their home speakers. We all decided to report this together, but instead of just going to Spotify, we went to the school administration first. Turns out what Ben was doing counts as cyberbullying and harassment, and our school has a zero tolerance policy for that kind of stuff. The school called his parents and mine for a meeting. When they showed all the evidence we had collected, Ben's face went.

He also said if I don't tell how much he spent on it, he'll let me drive it. It was only a couple hundred dollars, but we were broke and she would have been mad. My mother tried so hard to find out, but I kept the secret. So anytime we were in an open space, like an empty lot, he would let me drive it.

I asked my mother if I can drive her around when she has to go out, but she says absolutely not since I have no experience. Well, I can't argue because I don't want to get dad in trouble. This goes on for a few weeks. I keep asking. She keeps telling me no. This finally happened one day while dad was home and overheard. He comes in the room, gives me a nod and says, To my mother's. He's a better driver than you. Anyway, tosses me the keys and tells mom everything. I was so stoked and cheering. I can drive. I can drive, dad says. Drive it. If you can keep a secret for that long, you can keep the car, too.

One night while I was out apparently got completely hammered and was causing a scene at the apartment complex, so the police were called. I show up and see cop cars everywhere. I had enough and just booked a flight for the next morning to see another city.

He responds, can I see your bag really quick before you leave? I think I left something in there.

The woman on the phone sounded like she was barely holding back tears. Hi, this is Rebecca, Austin's mom from Emma's class. I need to talk to you about what your daughter did to my son today. I was folding laundry in the living room, trying to figure out what she was talking about. Emma was upstairs doing homework like she did every Tuesday. I'm sorry. What exactly happened, I asked, setting down one of Emma's tiny soccer jerseys. Rebecca's voice got shakier. Your daughter punched Austin in the face during recess. His nose is bleeding and he won't stop crying. The teacher said Emma just walked up and hit him out of nowhere. My heart sank. Emma was the quietest kid in her 4th grade class, always reading fantasy books during lunch instead of playing with other kids. She barely spoke above a whisper. At home, the idea of her punching anyone seemed impossible. Are you sure it was Emma? She's never been violent before, I heard Rebecca scoff through the phone. Of course, I'm sure Austin described her perfectly. Little blonde girl with the unicorn backpack. That's your daughter, right? It was. Emma had begged for that sparkly unicorn backpack at target last month. Told Rebecca I talked to Emma and hung up, feeling confused and disappointed. When I called Emma downstairs, she walked slowly into the kitchen. Her head down, honey, did something happen at school today with a boy named Austin? Emma's face crumpled immediately and she started sobbing. I'm sorry, mom. I know hitting is wrong, but I couldn't take it anymore. She wiped her nose on her sleeve, leaving a wet streak. He's been mean to me every day since school started. He calls me weird and stupid. He throws my books in the MUD during recess. My stomach dropped as she continued. Yesterday he pushed me off the monkey bars and I scraped my knee really bad. Today he said my dead grandma was probably glad she didn't have to look at my ugly face anymore. I was crying so hard she could barely get the words out. I felt my blood pressure rising. Emma's grandmother had passed away just two months ago and Emma still slept with the teddy bear grandma gave her. Why didn't you tell me any of this before I asked? Pulling her into a hug. I thought if I ignored him, he'd stop. But today when he said that about grandma, I just got so angry. She looked up at me with red, puffy eyes, punched him right in his mean face. That's when I realized Austin's mom had no clue her kid was a bully. I grabbed my phone and called Rebecca back. Hi, it's Emma's mom again. I think we need to have a longer conversation about what's been happening between our kids. Becca immediately went Into defense mode. Look, if you're trying to make excuses for your daughter's violence. I cut her off. Has Austin mentioned anything about bothering Emma at school, calling her names or pushing her around? There was a long pause. Austin would never do that. He's always been such a sweet, gentle boy. I could hear the doubt creeping.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We've known each other since freshman year. And when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything, 50 50, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird serious face he starts with, so I've been thinking and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. But she's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue because honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I tell her, fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realise I bought literally everything that makes it nice. The 50 inch t V mounted on the wall, mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones. The router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain the next morning.

What did you learn? My ex wife had a grandfather that was a multi millionaire. Christmas time at their house was like being in another world. All of the different family members would try to get a moment with the king and kissed ass as much as possible. I spent my time down on the ground playing with my kids and was happy to get out of there. About a week or two after the second Christmas, I got a phone call from Grandpa. He wanted to know what he could do for my family. I told him I didn't want any of his money, but I would like my kids to know their great grandfather. Later that year, he showed up at our place unexpected and spent most of the afternoon telling stories with me about his youth. He set up a trust fund for each one of my kids to have their college paid for. A little bit after that, he told me out of all of his in laws, I was the only one that never asked him for anything but to be himself.

It looked like he was carrying all of his books and I thought he must just be a nerd bringing them all home for the weekend. I was pretty popular at the time and was going to a party that night, so I just kept walking. But then a few guys were passing him and all decided to trip him. So he landed in the dirt. They stepped on his glasses and laughed at him. I felt horrible, so I went over to help. He looked totally broken. But when I helped him up, he sort of smiled at me. His name was Kyle and I asked why. I had never seen him before. He actually lived close to me and turned out to be pretty cool. And I don't know why, but before he left, I invited him to the party that night. I was really surprised when he actually showed up and we got to know him. He came back to school with all his books that Monday and by senior year, we were best friends. He completely changed and all the girls loved him now. And at graduation, he had to give a speech since he had the best grades. He was nervous, but I told him he'd do great. He got up, but instead of giving his speech, he told everyone about That Friday, when I said hi to him, he told our entire grade that he was actually taking all his books home that weekend because he planned to take his own life that night. And so his mom didn't have to go clean out his locker. He said, I literally saved his life that day, and I didn't even know.

Growing up, I wanted to be just like my mom, even if that meant being sold at 16, bred like livestock and learning to smile when my husband brought home other women's perfume on his clothes. My mother taught me these things were badges of honour, proof that we were good women who understood our place in the world. She would sit me down at her vanity mirror and brush my hair while telling me stories of my grandmother who raised 14 children from three different women her husband kept and how she never once complained or showed jealousy because that was weakness. When I turn 16, my parents arranged my marriage to a 23 year old doctor and I felt chosen, special and better than my cousins who were matched with farmers and merchants. My mother cried happy tears at the ceremony while whispering in my ear that I was fulfilling my destiny, that my grandmother would be so proud to see me continuing our family's legacy of strength. The wedding night came with pain that made me bite through my lip. But my mother had warned me this was normal, that the blood on the sheets was proof of my purity and worth. My husband was kind compared to what I've been taught to expect, never raising his hand to me, never forcing himself on me after I got pregnant with when our parents demanded grandchildren immediately and we complied. Because that's what good children did. But after five encounters that left me sobbing into my pillow, he promised never to touch me again if I didn't want it. I thought this made him the best husband in the world. And I told my mother about his kindness, how lucky I was that he respected my wishes. She smiled and said I was blessed that most men wouldn't be so understanding. When we moved to Canada after I turned 18, he asked my permission to see other women for his needs. And I grant did it proudly, thinking this made me enlightened and mature. My mother had done the same for my father. My aunts all knew about their husband's arrangements. So I called my mother to tell her how well I was handling marriage. She praised me for being so wise, understanding that men had needs wives couldn't always fulfill. The jealousy was a poison that destroyed families. Every Friday night, he would leave after putting our sons to bed and I would clean the house and feel accomplished like I was winning at being a wife. And Covid arrived and changed everything. I got so sick I could barely breathe. And for over a month, he became someone I'd never seen before. He held my hair when I vomited, changed my sheets when I sweated through them, sang Lullaby.

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the centre of attention for 5 minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance, Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day, the one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding, I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up, he said. And I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself and I just can't deal with that stress on my wedding day. The line went quiet for like 10 seconds and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now you're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. She's basically family. I tried To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice. Hope think he changed his mind? He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, he says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted like 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewellery. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today with a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. She's coming anyway, Madison.

My eight year old grandson asked if he could say Grace. As we bowed our heads, he said, god is good, god is great. Thank you for the food, and I would thank you even more if Grandpa gets us ice cream for dessert. And liberty and justice for all. Amen. Along with the laughter from the other customers nearby, I heard a woman remark, that's what's wrong with parenting these days. Kids today don't even know how to pray. Asking god for ice cream, why I never? Hearing this, my grandson burst into tears and asked me, did I do it wrong? Is god mad at me? So, after I assured him that he had done a terrific job and that god was certainly not mad at him, an elderly gentleman approached the table. He winked at my grandson and said, I happen to know that god thought that was a great prayer. Really? My grandson asked, cross my heart, the man replied. Then in a theatrical whisper, he added, indicating the woman whose remark had started this whole thing, too bad she never asks god for ice cream. A little ice cream is sometimes good for the soul. Naturally, I bought my grandchildren ice cream. At the end of the meal, my grandson stared at his ice cream for a moment, and then he did something I will remember the rest of my life. He picked up his sundae. And without a word walked over and placed it in front of the woman. With a big smile he told her here, this is for you. Shove it up your ass, you grouchy old bitch

But the woman wasn't angry at all. She even revealed an intriguing smile. The boss, however, witnessed this scene. The angry boss made Jack stay late to work overtime. But when he was about to go to the bathroom, Jack saw a terrifying sight. His female supervisor had been shot by a killer. Jack was so frightened, he quickly turned away. While the killer was disposing of the body, Jack hurriedly returned to his workstation. He immediately picked up his phone to call the police. Little did he know, the phone automatically shut down due to low battery. Jack had no choice but to charge his phone. But the phone couldn't turn on right away. When he looked back, he saw his colleagues corpse. Before Jack could process what was happening, the sound of a door opening came from not far away. Jack quickly hid in the storage room. But the killer suddenly looked in his direction. Then the killer dragged the body toward him. With nowhere to escape, Jack prepared for a final stand. But just as the killer was about to open the door, Jack's charging phone suddenly powered on. The startup sound immediately attracted the killer's attention. While the killer went to find the phone, Jack immediately escaped from the storage room. He entered an office, trying to trigger the fire alarm. But even after burning for a while, it didn't activate. It turned out the killer had closed the valve. Beforehand, he quickly set fire to the nearby curtains. Burning flames were indeed noticed by people in the building across. Jack immediately asked them to call the police, but this also drew the killer's attention. When the killer rushed over, he encountered Jack. But the killer didn't have time to chase Jack. Right then, he quickly extinguished the fire in the office. Seeing the people across preparing to call the police, he hastily indicated that the situation was resolved and no call was needed. The killer suddenly thought about Jack's phone. After seeing the photos on Jack's phone, he immediately conceived an evil plan.

That's basically full time. 40 hours is full time. You only work 39, you don't get any benefits. Either way, I need less hours. I can't keep working six days a week. I have classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so I would appreciate it if I could be off those days. Only full time employees get a set schedule. Since you're part time, I can't guarantee anything, but I'll see what I can do. Fine, but I'm telling you now, if I'm scheduled on Tuesday or Thursday, I'm calling in sick. Are you sure you can't be here during school? You can't tune in on a zoom or something? No. No one wants to work these days. Hey, I overheard you asking Alex if you wanted extra hours. I'm willing to take them if they're available. Are you part time or full time? Full time. You probably already have enough hours. I'm actually only scheduled to come in three days and work 25 hours this week. That's why I'm willing to pick up any extra hours. Maybe next week. We can't afford to give you any more hours this week. Hey, Alex, let me know if you want more hours, alright? I Want less? Wait. Would you wanna switch schedules? Yes. Hey, Frankie, put me down. I mean, put Alex down for those extra hours.

I didn't receive anything. My grandmother's face darkened as she turned to my parents. The fifteen thousand dollar graduation trip to Europe I sent for Diego three months ago. The silence was deafening. My mom started fidgeting with her new designer purse, the one that mysteriously appeared last month along with matching shoes. My dad's gold chain suddenly felt heavier around his neck. And I noticed his expensive watch for the first time. We. We thought it would be better if my mom stamp her newly done nails, tapping nervously on the table. If what? Grandma's voice cut like ice. If you stole from your own son. That's when it all clicked. The sudden shopping sprees every weekend. My sister's new iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Family vacation to Cancun that I wasn't invited to. A kitchen renovation. Dad's new motorcycle sitting in our driveway. They'd stolen my graduation gift and spent it on themselves like it was Christmas morning. My sister Estania, who never worked a day in her life, was wearing earrings that cost more than my monthly gas station salary. Diamond studs that sparkled under the restaurant lights. She. I didn't even look up from her plate, too busy admiring her fresh manicure. You gave them everything their entire lives, I said quietly, my voice shaking with years of suppressed anger. And they took The one thing meant for me. The one thing I actually earned. Grandma stood up, her chair scraping against the floor loud enough to make nearby diners turn. 20 years I've watched you favor Estania over Diego like he's invisible. I sent that money specifically for him. With a letter explaining every detail of the trip I planned. My mom's face went white as paper. We never got a letter, I swear. Because you threw it away after cashing the check that had his name on it. The restaurant felt silent, despite other diners around us. Even the waiters seemed to sense the drama unfolding at our table. I couldn't hold back anymore. This explains everything. Why you suddenly had money for mom's Botox appointment and weekly spa days. Why dad bought that Harley Davidson he's been wanting for years. Why Estania got her nose job and started posting Instagram photos from five star hotels every single week. My grandmother's eyes widened with each revelation. Nose job? Instagram photos? Show me. I pulled out my phone and showed her Estania's recent posts. Bullside shots at luxury resorts in Miami. Designer shopping halls from Rodeo Drive. First class plane seats with champagne glasses. Expensive restaurant meals that cost more than I made in a week. All time stamped from the past three months. Right after my graduation, I've been working 70 hour weeks at the gas station. Just

I thought everyone had to check their mattress for cockroaches before lying down until I was 15 years old and went to someone else's house for the first time. My morning routine involved shaking out my shoes because mice nested in them overnight. I also had to brush maggots off my backpack because the smell of rotting meat from somewhere deep in the house attracted flies that laid eggs on everything. Path to the bathroom required stepping on compressed newspapers that squished with mystery liquids that had been leaking from garbage bags since 2,011. Sometimes I'd hear crunching when I accidentally stepped on the bones of one of our cats that died and got buried under trash before anyone noticed. My breakfast came from sealed packages only because I once almost ate cereal that was full of ants. A lot of the time, I had to pee in bottles because the path to the toilet got blocked by the collapsing mountain of adult diapers my mother bought in bulk. Nobody in our house needed them, but she insisted they'd be worth money during the next pan. When Parker transferred to our school and picked me to be his history partner, I tried to convince him to switch. I knew eventually he'd want to meet outside school, but he had already turned in the paper with our names and said it would be too much hassle to change it now. He kept pushing. To work at my house I finally made up this whole story about my grandmother being sick. I said that she was super contagious and had something doctors couldn't figure out. He suggested his place instead and even offered to pick me up so I wouldn't have to take a bus. I said the bus didn't run to his neighborhood, even though really I just didn't wanna trap him in a car with my smell. I've been washing my clothes in the bathroom sink at school with the pink hand soap and drying them under the hand dryer, but the smell of decomposition and ammonia had gotten into the fabric permanently. Walking into his house broke my brain because my eyes didn't know what to do with all of the empty floor space it took.

Now you really look like your loser father. While my nieces were laughing, the next day her account was frozen and the bank for closed on her house. For 3 years I've been financially supporting my younger sister Jessica after her divorce. I paid her mortgage, you abilities, groceries, everything so she and her daughters wouldn't struggle. Jessica worked at a hair salon but barely made enough overtime. I noticed her attitude. She never said thank you, only criticized our life. If we bought a car, she'd say we were showing off. If we took Isabella on vacation, she'd complain that some of us aren't so lucky. Isabella, my daughter, has always been sweet with long shiny brown hair. Sometimes she'd come home saying Aunt Jessica scolded me or Aunt Jessica said my dress was ugly. Those comments bothered me. Everything changed one Saturday. Isabella was invited to a friend's birthday party, pretty and wanted to look like a princess. I decided to take her to Jessica for a special haircut. I called and said make Isabella look like a princess. I'll leave extra money. Jessica responded dryly, alright, leave her with me, but don't come too late. I dropped Isabella off at Jessica's house. Isabella was happy in her pink dress and sparkling shoes. I kissed her forehead and said I'd be back in a few hours. When I returned at five PM, I heard heartbreaking crying. As I approached, I heard Jessica shouting, now you look like your father's failure, bald and horrible just like him. Then came laughter. Jessica's laugh and her daughter's giggles. I slammed the door open. Is a. Bella was sitting in a chair with her head lowered. At her feet was a pile of hair scattered like trash. When she lifted her face, my world collapsed. She was completely bald. Jessica had shaved her head, leaving not a single strand. My little princess had red eyes from crying, her face filled with shame. Jessica stood beside her with a razor laughing. Her daughters were pointing at Isabella, mocking her look. She looks like an egg, Sophia said laughing. How ugly, added Lucia. I hugged Isabella tightly. She clung to me shaking and threw her sobs. Said, daddy, why did she do this to me? I just wanted to look pretty. What did you do to my daughter? I roared at Jessica. She stopped laughing but didn't seem sorry. Calm down, Antonio. It was just a joke, I told her. I was giving her a modern cut. She looks unique, she said with a mocking smile. A joke. You shaved my daughter's head. You humiliated her, she shrugged. Don't be dramatic. It's just hair. Plus that girl is always showing off with her long hair. Like my daughters aren't as beautiful. She's a seven year old girl who wanted to feel pretty. You did this out of envy, Jessica owed. Don't come At me with envy. Crap. You're always showing off your perfect life while I'm struggling alone. I pay for everything, Jessica, the house, food, everything. This is how you repay me. Well, too bad. If it bothers you, don't give me anything else. I don't want your charity. Don't worry, you won't have it anymore, I shouted, wrapping Isabella in my jacket. This isn't over, she laughed bitterly. Take your bald daughter and leave me in peace. The next day, I canceled every.

So my best friend Emma and I have been tight since middle school. We did everything together, shared secrets, went through all the messy teenage drama side by side. When she got engaged to Tyler two years ago, I was honestly more excited than she was. I immediately offered my family's backyard for the wedding because we have this gorgeous 5 acre property with huge oak trees and a Little Creek that runs through it. My parents were totally cool with it and Emma was crying happy tears talking about how perfect it would be. We spent months planning every detail. I'm talking spreadsheets, Pinterest boards, the whole nine yards. I helped her pick out flowers, tasted cake samples until we were sick and even drove three hours with her to find the perfect dress. My weekends were basically wedding planning central. I was supposed to be her maid of honour, obviously, and I'd already bought my dress and everything. Then about six weeks before the wedding, things got weird. Emma started being distant and would dodge my calls. When we did hang out, she seemed stressed and kept checking her phone constantly. I figured it was just pre wedding jitters because Tyler's mom had been making her life hell with all these demands about the guest list and decorations. Two weeks before the wedding, I get this text from Emma saying she needed to talk She shows up at my house looking like she hadn't slept in days. She sits down on my couch and just blurts out that I'm uninvited to the wedding. Not just uninvited from being made of honor, but uninvited completely. I'm sitting there like, what the hell just happened? She starts explaining that Tyler's family thinks I'm a bad influence because I have tattoos and work at a bar part time while going to college. Apparently, his mom saw my Instagram and decided I wasn't the type of person they wanted at their family event. Emma said she tried to fight for me, but Tyler gave her an ultimatum. Either I go or his family doesn't come and doesn't help pay for anything. I was so hurt I couldn't even be mad at first. This is my best friend of eight years choosing her future mother in law over me. I asked her if she was serious and she just nodded and said she hoped I'd understand. Then she had the nerve to ask if we could still use my family's property for the wedding since all the vendors were already booked and it would be too expensive to change venues. I just stared at her for like 30 seconds processing what she just asked me. She wants to kick me out of her wedding but still use my backyard. I told her absolutely not and that she needed to leave. He started crying, saying I was being unreasonable and That the wedding was already planned around my property. I reminded her that I was being unreasonable, not the person who just uninvited their best friend to appease some snobby in laws. Emma left and I immediately called my parents to tell them what happened.

My sister in law Jessica has this thing where she treats my 8 year old son Tyler like he's invisible. Whenever we're at family gatherings, she'll acknowledge every other kid in the room, give them hugs, ask about school, bring little gifts. But when it comes to Tyler, it's like he doesn't exist. She'll literally walk past him without even making eye contact. At first I thought maybe I was being paranoid, but then I started really paying attention. Last Christmas she brought presents for all six grandkids except Tyler. When my mother in law asked where Tyler's gift was, Jessica just shrugged and said, oh, I must have forgotten. But she had a whole list on her phone that she checked off as she handed out the other presents. The worst part is Tyler notices. He's a smart kid and he started asking me why Aunt Jessica doesn't like him. What am I supposed to say to that? Oh, honey, your aunt is just a petty adult who's mad at Mommy for some reason so she takes it out on you. I can't tell him that. The thing is, Jessica and I got into it about two years ago over something stupid. My husband's family has this tradition where they all go on a beach vacation together every summer. Well, that year Jessica decided she wanted to plan the whole thing and book Everything. She picked this expensive resort in Florida and expected everyone to pay like $800 per person. I told her we couldn't afford it, especially with Tyler needing new school clothes and us trying to save for a house. She got all huffy and said if we really wanted to prioritize family, we'd find a way to make it work. I said maybe we could look at somewhere more affordable so everyone could come. She completely lost it, started going off about how I was always trying to control everything and ruin her plans. I wasn't trying to control anything. I just wanted my family to be able to afford to participate. But she took it as some personal attack and has been ice cold to Tyler ever since. So last month was Jessica's birthday party. She was turning 35 and made this huge deal about it, rented out the back room at some fancy restaurant, invited like 50 people. The whole family was there, all the cousins, aunts, uncles, everyone. I decided I was done watching my kid get treated like garbage. When we walked into the party, I made sure to greet everyone else first. I hugged her mom, chatted with her sister, complimented her dad's new glasses, asked her brother about his job. I spent probably 20 minutes working the room, talking to every single person there. Jessica was standing right there the whole time, clearly expecting me to come say hi and wish her happy birthday. But I just kept talking to other people. When Tyler ran off to play with his cousins, I continued my rounds, making small talk with Jessica's friends, asking.

I've never been more proud. My wife stood up suddenly during our family BBQ and commanded our German Shepherd in a voice I'd never heard before, Zeus, attack. The dog launched himself at my sister, jaws locking onto her forearm as she screamed and fell backward off the picnic bench, blood immediately soaking through her shirt. I tackled Zeus off my sister while our kids ran inside crying and my parents screamed at my wife, calling her a psychopath who should be locked up. My mother was on the phone with 9 1 1, sobbing that her daughter in law had weaponized a dog against her own daughter, while my father tried to stop the bleeding with dish towels that turned red instantly. My sister was writhing on the ground screaming that my wife was insane and had always been jealous of her. While our cousins filmed everything, our 8 year old daughter stood at the window watching her aunt bleed. I grabbed my wife's shoulders, demanding to know what the hell was wrong with her, why she'd lost her mind and attacked my sister who'd been nothing but helpful with our kids. The neighbours came running over and backed away when they saw the blood pooling on the concrete. One of them saying they'd testify that my wife commanded the attack unprovoked. My brother in law was hysterical, calling my wife an attempted murderer. While I stood there wondering if my wife had snapped from stress, that's when my wife finally spoke up, found videos on Sophie's phone when she left it here last night, her voice shaking. What videos, I asked. She's been recording herself touching our children during babysitting. Everyone went silent except for my sister's moaning. And my wife continued quickly showing footage that made my legs go weak. I found 6 hours of her making Olivia play special games where she has to sit on her lap without clothes and worse things with Ben that I can't even say out loud. The video showed my sister's hands where they should never be while Olivia begged her to stop. And I, I felt like I couldn't breathe watching my sister tell our four year old it was their special secret. I only found this at 3:00am when I was looking for my charger and her phone lit up with a notification. My wife continued, tears streaming down her face. I spent all morning trying to figure out what to do. Called the police but they said they need to interview the kids first, which traumatize them more. And I tried to tell you, but you were setting up for the BBQ and said we'd talk later. I remembered brushing her off this morning when she'd seemed frantic, telling her whatever it was could wait until after the family party. Sophie had written notes about how she was going to frame me. For the abuse is edited videos where you can only hear the kids crying. And she was planning to call CPS tomorrow morning with an anonymous tip that would have me arrested. My wife showed us pages from Sophie's journal she found in her overnight bag filled with detailed descriptions of what she'd been doing to our children and her escalation plans. I wrote about wanting kids but not wanting to ruin her body with pregnancy and how our kids were perfect and would be better off with her once I was in prison. The pages included Sophie's step by step plan to plant evidence, her practice scripts for calling CPS and notes about which bruises on the kids she could photograph to blame on my wife. But that's not even why I had Zeus attack her. My wife said her voice break.

My brother Tyler always had this habit of taking my stuff without asking, but I never thought he'd go this far. Last month, I saved up for three months straight working at target to buy a ticket to see blink 1 82. This wasn't just any show either. They barely tour anymore and tickets were selling for like 200 bucks minimum. I finally got one during the pre sale and felt like I'd won the lottery. Kept the ticket in my desk drawer in this little plastic sleeve, checking on it every few days like some kind of weirdo. Tyler knew how excited I was about it. I'd been talking about this concert since they announced the tour. Hell, I even asked him if he wanted to come with me and offered to help him get a ticket, but he said he wasn't interested in old people music. Fast forward to last Tuesday, I come home from my shift and go to check on my ticket before dinner. The plastic sleeve is there, but it's empty. My heart literally dropped into my stomach. I tore my entire room apart thinking maybe it fell out somewhere. Nothing. I marched straight to Tyler's room and found him playing call of duty with his headset on. I yanked it right off his head and asked where my ticket was. He didn't even pause his game Just shrugged and said he sold it to some kid at school for 180 bucks because he needed money for new cleats. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. He sold my ticket that I bought with my money for his stupid soccer cleats. When I asked how he even got into my room, he said I left my door unlocked and he figured I wouldn't mind since I'm always sharing stuff with him anyway, which is complete bull because sharing a bag of chips is not the same as selling someone's concert ticket. I started yelling at him to get it back, but he said the kid already gave him the money and there was nothing he could do. He had the nerve to tell me to calm down and that I was being dramatic over just a concert. That's when I noticed his gaming setup, his PlayStation 5, the fancy racing wheel he got for his birthday, his gaming chair, two controllers, his huge monitor, all of it probably worth around 800 bucks total. I told him he had 24 hours to get my ticket back or I was selling his stuff. He laughed at me and said I wouldn't dare because mom and dad would kill me. Then he put his headset back on and ignored me like I wasn't even there. The next day after school, I checked with him one more time. Still no ticket. So I waited until he went to soccer practice and Our parents went grocery shopping. I loaded everything into our dad's truck, PlayStation, Monitor, all of it. I drove straight to this gaming store downtown that buys used stuff. The guy behind the counter looked at everything and offered me 650 cash on the spot. I told him I needed at least 700 because I had to replace something important. He agreed when he saw the receipt showing Tyler paid 12 for the PS five alone last year. I took that money and drove to the kids house that Tyler sold my ticket to. Turns out he was actually pretty cool about it. His mom made him give me the ticket back. When I explained what happened, she only made me pay her the one 80 her son originally paid. She said her kid could wait for the next tour. So I got my ticket back and still had 5 and 20 left over, which I put in my savings account when Tyler got home from.

I showed my son what it's like to be the weaker person and disown him. My dad would physically abuse my mom and also beat my siblings and me. I have four younger siblings, three of them being girls. I was the oldest and would try to take the beating for them. So when I was old enough and strong enough, I squared up against my father. I did so as many times as I needed to and I never let him put his hands on them. My father ended up going to prison for battery and we moved states back. My daughter still live with me since they are going to college, but my son has moved out and made his life. My son has gotten a girlfriend and I have met her. She is a sweet, loving and soft nature girl and I genuinely like her. Reminds me of my wife when she was younger. I invite my son and his girlfriend over for lunch and dinners quite often. They've now been dating for three years. And she would sometimes come over and help my daughters out with college stuff or just come over to hang out with them. I love her as family and have told her so. Four weeks ago, she came over and when I opened the door, the first thing I saw was that she had a busted lip. And a black eye and her eyes seemed to be dyed in blood. I immediately took her in and helped. Her daughters were also alarmed when they saw her. And when we asked her what happened, she told us that my son was the one who did it to her. I cried at hearing that and I hugged her and begged her for my forgiveness. She told us all about it and apologized for not telling us sooner. This wasn't the first time he had hit her. I've asked her if she has told her parents or the cops and she said that we were the first person she felt like going to cried. I reassured her that she was safe there and not to worry. I asked my daughter to clean up a spare bedroom for her as she would be staying. I cannot describe how I was feeling, but you guys can imagine it. I spent hours just staring at black TV screen looking at my reflection. A few days after she came to us, I invited my son over for dinner. I had her consent and knowledge to do so. First, my son came over and I've instructed my daughters to keep her in their rooms and they weren't there. She was with them as well in their rooms. When my son knocked on my door and I saw him again, I felt sick and my blood boiled, but I kept my composure and we sat down. To eat, I kept looking at his hands and knuckles and there were faint scraps and marks. I asked my son basic questions, trying to seem normal and nice, but the whole time I didn't see him as my son anymore. I saw him as my father and I didn't like that feeling. He acted normal until I asked him how everything was with his girlfriend and he choked on his food for a moment and told me everything's fine, she's just busy with work and I haven't seen her in a while. I just nodded and say, oh, that's nice, glad she's doing okay. We finished eating and I washed the dishes. I stood right next to him and asked why he was beating his girlfriend and told him, I think it's about time you stop bull pooping me about your girlfriend. He asked me what I was talking about and I told him to stand up and put his hands up, that I knew everything and I was gonna show him what it's like to be the weaker person. Before he could say another word, I swung at him, told him that this was the real deal. I did not hold back. I was gonna teach my son what it feels like to get beat. Since he thought it was okay, I told him to keep his hands up and to defend himself. We fought, but I of course was gonna be the last one standing. I asked Him how it felt to be weak, to be on the other end of it. He told me to stop, but I asked him if he stopped when she begged him to. I didn't stop beating him until his girlfriend came downstairs and screamed at me to stop. He looked horrified at seeing her. I told him that he was lucky she didn't tell her dad because her dad would have made him bury his own grave that he was.

He barely talks to me, but my little brother. Golden Child. Last year I broke my leg playing soccer, and when I tried to tell my dad what happened, he literally cut me off mid sentence, like, ugh, I don't want to hear about your girly stuff, sir. I fractured my femur. Anyway, last week I was in the living room playing Fortnite with my little brother, when out of nowhere he looks over and says, hey, can I ask you something kind of weird? I said, sure. He goes, what are periods like? One of my best friends just got hers, and I want to understand it better so I don't make it awkward. I smiled so big. Then I told him, well, first of all, they're different for everyone. Some people get bad cramps, some don't. But it's like your body is doing this monthly reboot and punishing you with pain and hormones for surviving another month without a baby. Laughed, and then I added, oh, and chocolate helps. Always chocolate. It was a sweet moment. But then from another room, my dad screams out, hey, shut up! No one wants to hear about something so disgusting! It's not a man's place to know those things about a woman. My jaw Dropped. I was about to go off before I could say a word. My little brother just looked up at him and said, no wonder mom left you. Silence. Like entire house goes dead silent. My dad just turned and walked back into the other room like a defeated NPC. I was wheezing. Like actually cry laughing. My little brother looked back at me and said, so. Chocolate, right? I said, make her a goody bag, include her favorite candy, maybe some fuzzy socks. Just let her know she's seen, but you don't see her any differently. And in that moment, I realized my brother might look like our dad, but he's nothing like him. And honestly, that gives me so much hope.

My 4 year old son Ethan speaks two languages because my husband is Belgian and we live there most of the time. Sometimes Ethan mixes up English and French words in the same sentence, which is totally normal for bilingual kids. His teachers even told us it's no big deal. But my sister in law Kelly thinks she knows better. Every time we visit my parents in England, she acts like Ethan has some serious problem. She'll correct him in the super rude way, rolling her eyes and making him repeat everything perfectly. My husband and I just gently help him when needed, but Kelly treats him like he's broken. Last month we were staying at my parents house for a week. I was upstairs feeding my baby daughter when I heard Ethan crying downstairs. I rushed down and found him holding his special sippy cup, tears streaming down his face. Kelly was just sitting there scrolling her phone while my brother tried to calm Ethan down. I asked what happened and Kelly explained like she was doing me a favor. She said Ethan had asked for water in his mixed up way so she completely ignored him. She understood exactly what he wanted but refused to help because he didn't ask in perfect English. She actually told me I was ignoring my son's obvious speech issues. I was furious but my husband dragged Me away before I could explode. That night at dinner, I got my chance for revenge. Kelly asked me to pass the salt, but she said it in her thick northern accent with tons of slang. Something like chuck us the salt, will you love? I had an idea. I just stared at her like she hadn't said anything. She asked again, louder this time. I, I kept ignoring her completely. My brother asked why I wasn't responding and I said I couldn't understand Kelly because she wasn't speaking proper English. I told him maybe he should address her obvious speech issues instead of enabling her. Kelly's face went bright red. She started yelling that there was nothing wrong with how she talked and that I was being ridiculous. Just shrugged and said I wasn't going to respond until she could speak correctly, exactly like she does to my 4 year old son. My parents tried to calm everyone down, but Kelly stormed out of the dining room. My brother followed her calling me petty and childish. Maybe I was being childish, but she had it coming. You don't mess with someone's kid and expect them to just take it. The next morning, Kelly barely spoke to anyone. When Ethan asked her for help reaching a toy, she actually helped him without making any comments about his language. She avoided me for the rest of our visit, which was honestly perfect.

You're fired. I left quietly without making a scene, then told my husband to just smiled. Four hours later, panic broke out, 98 missed calls. I've been the head chef at Romano's for three years. When I started, it was a struggling family restaurant with two star reviews and empty tables. I transformed everything, rebuilt the menu, trained the staff, forced local ingredients. Within a year, we were booked solid with a waiting list. But when old Mister Romano died last spring, everything changed. His son Giovanni inherited the place and he had different ideas. Cut costs, use frozen ingredients, fire half the kitchen staff. People can't tell the difference anyway, he'd say, counting receipts. While I fought to maintain the standards that built our reputation, I refused to compromise our lamb. Also buco was legendary. Our house made pasta brought people from three states over. I wasn't about to ruin that for Giovanni's profit margins. So on my 32nd birthday, after our biggest week ever, he called me into the cramped office above the dining room. Birthday balloons from the staff still hung in the kitchen below. Here's my surprise for you, he said with this smug grin. You're fired effective immediately. You're too difficult to work with. I stood there, soft stained apron still tied around my waist, watching him lean back in his father's old chair. He just solved world Hunger. I didn't argue, didn't cry, just untied my apron, set it on his desk and walked out past the confused prep cooks who'd worked under me for years. The drive home felt endless. Three years, my life gone, my reputation, my team, my recipes all handed over to someone who thought ketchup was a vegetable. My husband, Scott, was waiting in our kitchen with a bottle of wine and that knowing smile he gets when he's up to something. How did the birthday shift go, he asked, already pouring two glasses. Terrible. Giovanni fired me, his grin wide.

If you leave, you go alone. I slept on Ava's floor that night. I woke up with her lying next to me. After she went to school, I put cameras in the living room and kitchen. I told him they were for robbers. He didn't care. He was too hungover to fight. Then I found another page in Ava's diary. She drew a picture of me. It said my real mom under it. Please don't leave me. If I needed proof to save my girl, I'd get proof. The cameras recorded everything, him leaving Ava alone.

My parents had this absolute obsession with proper dinner etiquette. When I was growing up, the rule was crystal clear. No elbows on the table during meals. My dad would literally tap the back of my arm with his fork if I slipped up. Three strikes in one meal meant washing dishes for a week. No exceptions, no appeals process. By 13, I was, if they wanted proper etiquette, I'd give them proper etiquette. But not just any etiquette. I went full 1800s Victorian aristocracy on them. It started small. I began using excessively formal language at dinner. Mother, would you be so kind as to pass the Alt? I find this chicken, while prepared with obvious care and affection, lacks the proper sodium content for my developing palette. My mom shot my dad a confused look. Dad just shrugged. The next night, I showed up to dinner wearing my church clothes, a clip on tie. I pulled out my mom's chair for her, bowed slightly, and said, your seat awaits, Madam. When my little sister giggled, I turned to her with deadly seriousness and said, A lady never laughs with her mouth full, dear sister. My parents thought it was a phase. It wasn't. I started bringing a cloth napkin to the table, which I would dramatically unfold and place on my lap with flourish. I dab the corners of my mouth after every Third bite. Regardless of whether anything was there, one must maintain appearances, I'd explained to no one in particular. I studied Victorian table manners online and implemented every bizarre rule I could find. I'd hold my soup spoon outward from the bowl, sipping from the side rather than the at. The proper way, I'd announce, according to Queen Victoria's personal etiquette advisor. My dad finally broke when I started bringing a small bell to dinner, which I'd ring whenever I needed some thing passed. Butler's bell, I explained innocently. Since we're so concerned with proper table etiquette, I assumed we'd want to embrace all aspects of formal dining. We don't have a butler, my dad said through gritted teeth. Then perhaps someone should inform mother, as she appears to be serving in that capacity, I replied with a straight face, while gesturing to mom passing the potatoes. The situation escalated when I created formal place cards for everyone.

My buddy Chris and I have been tight since middle school. We're talking 15 years of friendship. He's got three kids, Emma, who just turned 18, Jake, who's 16, and little Mia who's 12. Chris has always been struggling financially. His wife left him two years ago and stuck him with all the debt from their failed business. I works two jobs just to keep the lights on. About six months ago, my startup finally sold. I'm talking life changing money here, eight figures. I went from eating ramen to suddenly having more cash than I knew what to do with. The first thing I did was pay off my parents mortgage. Second thing was help out Chris. But here's where it gets interesting. I didn't just write Chris a check. I had a different plan. I showed up at their house on a Saturday morning with three envelopes. Chris was confused when I handed one to each kid and told them not to open them until I said so. He kept asking what was going on, but I just smiled and said, wait. Emma opened hers first. Inside was a check for $50,000 and a note that said for college, no strings attached. She literally screamed and started crying. Jake opened his next. Same amount, same note. Even little Mia got 50 thousand with a note saying for when you turn 18. Chris just stood there. With his mouth open. Then he got mad, like really mad. He started yelling about how he couldn't accept this, how it wasn't right, how he didn't want charity. Kids were jumping around excited, but Chris was having none of it. That's when I pulled out the fourth envelope. Inside was a check for $200,000 made out to Chris, along with the deed to a small rental property I bought the week before. Completely paid off, the rental income would cover his monthly expenses forever. Chris broke down crying right there in his living room. But then he surprised me. He handed all the checks back and said he couldn't take them, said it would ruin our friendship, said his kids needed to earn their way in life. I looked at him and said, Chris, you've been there for me through everything. When my dad had his heart attack, you drove me to the hospital at 3:00am. When I got fired from my first job, you let me crash on your couch for three months. When Sarah broke up with me, you sat with me in that bar until they kicked us out. This isn't charity. This is family. Then Emma spoke up. She said, dad, I've been working at the grocery store, saving for college. I have $800. This means I can actually go to the school I want instead of just community college. Jake chimed in, dad, I been stressing about how we're gonna pay for my car. Insurance now I don't have to get a job and can focus on school. Even little Mia said, daddy, does this mean we can finally go to Disney World? Chris looked at his kids, then at me, then back at his kids. He. I picked up the checks and said, okay, but I'm paying you back somehow. I told him the only payback I wanted was to watch his kids succeed. Here's the crazy part, though. Two weeks later, Chris calls me freaking out. Turns out Emma had told some kids at school about the money. Word spread fast. Suddenly, Chris was getting calls from relatives he hadn't heard from in years, all with sob stories and.

My brother Joe and I have always been close, but not because we're similar. It's because our parents made it so damn clear who they actually cared about. Joe has a twin sister, Jill, and our parents have always treated her like she's royalty. They wanted a daughter so bad they practically forgot Joe existed. Jill got the attention, the shopping trips, the praise. Joe got ignored. So I stepped in. I started doing little things for him, taking him out with my friends when Jill went on her mall princess adventures, cheering him on at school plays while our parents skipped out for one of Jill's glittery pageants. First it was just pity. But over time, I realised something. I actually like Joe. He's real funny, grounded. Meanwhile, Jill's grown into this bratty, entitled, can't be bothered drama machine. Now they're both graduating. Jill's heading to some fancy school in San Francisco, fully funded by Mommy and daddy, of course. Joe got into a school near me in Seattle. He earned a full ride scholarship. You'd think that'd make our parents proud, but no, they're using it as an excuse to not give him a single cent. You know, K, oh, you got a scholarship, cool. Figure the rest out on your own. So I called a few people while on Facetime with Joe, trying to help him line up a decent job for the fall, He's better off not being financially tied to our parents anyway, that with their money comes their control. He started to feel better, like he wasn't complete, completely screwed. And then the next day, Jill starts blowing up my phone. Apparently she overheard the whole thing, starts demanding I help her find a job, too, because she doesn't wanna hear dad nagging her about money. I told her politely that I don't know anyone in SF. She's better off just asking our parents. That's when she lost it, called me out for favoring Joe over her, said I was picking sides. And honestly, yeah, I am. I don't even deny it anymore. Joe deserves someone in his corner. Jill has everyone else. She doesn't need me.

Second time a year later at her birthday dinner. You're sweet, but I need someone more ambitious. That word stung. Ambitious. Like our four years together meant nothing. Two weeks later, she was Instagram official with Logan, my former best friend since high school. Trust fund kid with a BMW his daddy bought and a marketing empire that was actually his uncle's firm. They flaunted it everywhere. Expensive restaurants I couldn't afford, designer clothes. Constant vacation posts to places I've never seen. Our entire friend group acted like it was destiny, not betrayal. They just make sense together. They'd say I was crushed, but channeled everything into medical school applications. Took out massive loans, moved three states away, and disappeared into 18 hour study days. No social media, no dating. for focus on becoming the surgeon I'd always dreamed of being. While I was killing myself in organic chemistry and anatomy labs, Brittany and Logan were living their best life. Engaged after six months, with a ring that cost more than my entire tuition. The wedding was planned for some Vineyard in Napa. Two years into my surgery residency at Children's Hospital, I met Lily at a pediatric trauma conference. She. I was presenting research on Emergency interventions. Brilliant. Passionate about saving kids lives. We talked for hours about everything except medicine. She made me laugh for the first time in years. Eight months of dating before she casually mentioned having an older brother. He's kind of a mess. Living off our parents at 30, dating this girl who thinks she's too good for everyone. When she said his name was Logan, my blood ran cold. When she showed me his Instagram, there was Britney posing with my replacement life. Wait. Hey, Lily said. Noticing my reaction, you know them? I told her everything. Instead of being upset, Lily started laughing. Oh, my god, you're that Noah. Britney talks about her boring ex who became a doctor at every family dinner. She has no idea we're together. Logan complains that she keeps comparing him to some guy who actually did something with his life. Fast forward to my little sister's wedding.

My parents were so worried about me dating a skater boy, they couldn't imagine he'd be the reason I'm still alive today. A few nights ago, my parents found out about my skater boyfriend, reggis, when his message popped up on my screen at dinner. I love you, too. Who the heck are you talking to? My mom shouted, glaring at the screen of my phone. You're 14. No dating until you're 30. We were very clear. Dad pulled up Reggis's Instagram on his own phone. Escape border? Really? This is who you're risking your future for? I tried to reason with them, but they refused to listen and forced me to block him everywhere, right there, over dinner. You'll thank us when you're in college, mom said while I sobbed. My friends tried passing messages between us at school, but my parents found out and threatened to call their parents. Eventually, everyone gave up, except for Greggus. Greggus showed up mysteriously in my valorant lobby. Hey, Mel. It's been a while, he said, his voice breaking. I miss you, Mel. I know we're not supposed to talk, but let's at least play like we used to. We started meeting in the lobbies every day after that, just playing and chatting about normal things. School friends, my strict parents. He never once tried to convince me to sneak around or meet up in person. He never complained. About my parents or tried to turn me against them. When I vent about how unfair they were being, he'd actually defend them. Sometimes they're just scared, Once my older sister got mixed up with some bad people in high school. Parents get paranoid. He still cared about me in all the ways that mattered. When I failed my chemistry test because I couldn't focus, he spent three hours teaching me balancing equations over discord. When my grandmother got sick, he stayed up until 3:00am just listening to me cry. You can always reach me here, he promised. I don't care what time it is. Mom almost got us once when she walked by while discord was open. I clicked to my game lobby just in time. Homework break? She asked. I nodded and switched back to my essay, my heart pounding so hard I thought she'd hear it after she left Greg's message. Maybe we should stop. I don't want to get you in trouble, but I couldn't lose him again. He was the only person who I could rely on. And thank god I didn't lose him, because a couple of days later, my friend Sarah and I got caught up in some shady business. It was supposed to be a normal Saturday night sleepover. Her parents went out for their anniversary, leaving us to watch movies and eat junk food. I was on the phone messaging Gregus on discord when Sarah's older brother Joshua came. Home from college, completely wasted with two other friends, Sarah immediately tensed up. baby sis and baby girl. He winked disgustingly. He and his friends sat beside us on the sofa, placing his arm over my shoulder, constantly whispering things like, I know you're not as innocent as you act, and your parents don't have to know. I pushed his face away and stood up, glaring. Can you stop? Sarah was almost crying, begging me not to make him mad. He gets mean when he's drunk. She was, just ignore him and he'll pass out soon. But when Joshua grabbed my waist and tried to pull me onto his lap, I grabbed Sarah's arm and ran to the bathroom. Quickly locking the door, he started pounding on it, laughing with his friends about how I was playing hard to get and needed to loosen up. Sarah hopped into the tub, hugging her knees to her chest. I patted my pockets, realizing I had left my phone in the living room. Soon the knocks on the door became angrier. Hitting the door harder, jiggling the handle aggressively, Sarah meekly handed me her phone.

Housing lottery put us together freshman year. The football player and the scholarship kid. From day one, he made it clear what he thought of me. Seriously? You're studying on a Friday night? He'd laugh. This is college, man. You're supposed to be making memories. His memories involved coming back at 3:00am, stumbling into my desk, and. And occasionally vomiting near my backpack. Things shifted in October when he realized he was failing economics. The coach had warned him, maintain a 2.5 GPA or get benched. Hey, you're good at this stuff, right? He dropped his textbook on my keyboard. I need help. I agreed to tutor him, explain supply and demand curves created practice problems. He nodded along, then asked, so can you just write my paper for me? I've got a game this weekend. I refused, offered to review his draft instead. He laughed like I. I told a joke. Come on, nobody will know. I'll pay you. I can't do that, I said. It's academic dishonesty. We could both get expelled. His smile faded. Whatever, man. Thought you were cool. After that, our fragile roommate peace collapsed. He'd invite friends over when I had exams. Accidentally Spill drinks on my notes, hide my alarm clock. Before important classes, I started spending more time at the library, coming back only to sleep. I was working two part time jobs alongside a full course load. Midterms came.

Now coach says I might lose my scholarship. I tried to help. I replied, you wanted me to do it for you. Then came the real breaking point. I saved for two years to buy my first car. A used Honda with 120,000 miles. Nothing fancy, but it meant I could live off campus next year. The morning after Brian received his final warning from the athletics department, I found my car with all four tires slashed. Loser scratched into the door. Windshield crack. Campus security said they couldn't.

I was actually excited to have the house to myself. Saturday night around ten PM, I was in my pajamas watching Netflix when I heard our back door open. I figured it was my brother coming to check on me like he'd promised. So I called out, Jake, is that you? No answer. I muted the TV and listened. Footsteps in the kitchen, but they were too quiet, too careful. Jake would have just yelled back or come straight to the living room. These footsteps were deliberately trying to be silent. My heart started pounding. I grabbed my phone and crept toward the kitchen, thinking maybe I should call 9, 1, 1. But as I got closer, I heard a voice I recognized. She's definitely here. Her car is in the driveway and all the lights are on. It was my brother's best friend, Marcus. He'd been coming to our house since middle school, practically lived here during high school. I'd known him for years. Then I heard another voice. You sure her parents aren't coming back tonight? Positive. They're three hours away at some fancy resort and Jake's not coming home until Sunday. I froze. Why was Marcus here with someone else and why were they. Talking about my parents schedule, I heard Marcus again. I've been planning this for months. Every time I'm over here, I've been figuring out the layout, where her room is, when she's usually alone. Tonight's perfect. My blood turned to ice. Marcus, who'd eaten dinner at our table hundreds of times, who my parents trusted completely, who Jake considered his best friend, had been planning something. The other voice said. What if she screams? She won't. She trust me. I'll just tell her I came to check on her like Jake asked. By the time she realizes what's happening, it'll be too late. I was shaking so hard I could barely hold my phone. I had maybe 30 seconds before they came looking for me. The front door was too far and they'd hear me running. I was trapped.

I thought everyone had to check their mattress for cockroaches before lying down, until I was 15 years old and went to someone else's house for the first time. My morning routine involved shaking out my shoes because mice nested in them overnight. I also had to brush maggots off my backpack because the smell of rotting meat from somewhere deep in the house attracted flies that laid eggs on everything. The path to the bathroom required stepping on compressed newspapers that squished with mystery liquids that had been leaking from garbage bags since 2,011. Sometimes I'd hear crunching when I accidentally stepped on the bones of one of our cats that died and got buried under trash before anyone noticed. My breakfast came from sealed packages only because I once almost ate cereal that was full of ants. A lot of the time, I had to pee in bottles because the path to the toilet got blocked by the collapsing mountain of adult diapers my mother bought in bulk.

Walking into his house broke my brain because my eyes didn't know what to do with all of the empty floor space. It took me, like 10 seconds to realize those white things were actual walls that didn't have brown roach stains, water damage, black streaks from whatever gross fungus was eating our house from the inside. His kitchen had a table with nothing on it, just empty space where people could put plates and eat food like normal people. When he opened a cabinet, there were dishes stacked all neat. Instead of falling out in this avalanche of broken stuff and mouse poop, he pulled out two clean glasses without having to wash them first or check for dead bugs inside. The refrigerator opened without having to throw your whole body against it because the seal wasn't Broken from years of nasty inside were leftovers in containers with actual lids, and vegetables that were green like they're supposed to be instead of brown liquid in plastic bags. The milk was just milk, not chunks floating in yellow water. When he said, god, my mom is such a neat freak. It's honestly embarrassing how she makes me clean my room every single day while pointing at a bedroom that looked like something from a movie, I made this weird choking sound like an animal being strangled. I started crying so hard I puked on his clean carpet. He got me water in a glass that didn't even have gross film on it and helped me to his bathroom where I could wash my face in a sink that was white, not brown. The sink had regular water that didn't smell like rotten eggs. I finally stopped crying. He just said, you can come here whenever you need to without asking why. Seeing a normal house made me completely lose it. When his mom drove me home later, I tried to get her to stop at the corner, but she insisted on taking me to my actual house because it was getting dark. When we pulled up to my place, I saw Parker and his mom staring at the newspapers covering every window. From inside, they saw all of the shopping carts my mother stole from grocery stores rusted and piled in the yard, and the dead tree covered In moldy plastic bags she hung to dry so she could use them again, even though they were covered in mold and bird crap. Parker's mom tried to hide it, but I could see she was horrified. Parker grabbed my arm before I got out and whispered, my mom says you can stay at our house whenever you need to. And I knew they understood everything without me having to. I thanked them both and ran inside, being careful to not open the door enough for them to see the disaster inside. That night, while my mother was passed out, I started with one corner of my room and filled a trash bag with obvious garbage, including food wrappers from when I was in elementary school and tissues so old they turned to dust when I touched them. My mother screamed at me when she noticed things were missing, but I kept going. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more!

It costs about $40 to build. It's hardly the stuff of cutting edge technology. That's like a speed. But this handmade device, powered by two 9 volt batteries, is stealing millions of dollars worth of diesel gas from Florida to California every day, simply by fooling the pumps. That gear is part of the pump pulsar, the device inside the pump that counts dollars per gallons. The numbers we see clicking there, the slower it goes, the cheaper it is. Correct. Even though the gas is flowing at more than $5 a gallon, the pulsar is tricked, allowing thieves to hoard the fuel in large bladders like this for just pennies on the dollar. Then selling it on the black market at a deep, deep discount. Let's do the math. Each device steals two to three million dollars in fuel, pumping the diesel at five cents a gallon. Cost to build that device, about $40. This video shows a thief accessing a gas pump in seconds. He was installing a skimmer targeting debit and credit cards.

They then loaded the money bags with over $18 million into a U Haul, destroyed the CCTV tapes and returned to the party. Then they sat on the money for six months before hiring a crooked lawyer to set up a real estate money laundering scheme to avoid suspicion. Two years after the robbery, one of the men paid a real estate broker with a stack of money still wrapped in the original currency strap. The broker immediately reported it to the police.

One, Jeffrey Dahmer drilled a hole into some victim's skulls and tried pouring different toxic liquids into the hole. He was trying to make a sex slave that could eat and drink but could in no way fight back or escape. The worst fact is that victims might survive the first hole with all brain function intact and live long enough to be fully aware they were going to get a second or third hole drilled. Two, surgeons used to operate on infants without anesthesia, including open heart surgery. They have stopped this, however, in the 1980s. 3, manatees have vaginas that are the most anatomically similar to humans. Manatees may also be the inspiration for myths about mermaids, beautiful half fish women that lured sailors to their deaths. Connecting those dots has been mentally scarring. 4, that a dolphin committed suicide after falling in love with its handler that used to jerk the dolphin off. 5. When the challenger exploded in 1986, the astronauts didn't die from the explosion, nor did they die from depressurization as NASA has initially claimed. There is some evidence they turned on their personal oxygen supply. They died from impact. When they hit the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, they were in free fall for two and a/2 minutes.

One. The first piece of jewelry I bought my wife was a necklace. We went on holiday and she lost it. I said I would replace it, but it wasn't the same. She was upset that she'd lost it for sentimental reasons. I emailed the hotel, and of course, they hadn't found it. So I bought a replacement and told my wife they found it. 2. Not me, but my parents. If my mom wants to hide literally anything from my dad, no matter what it is, she just puts it somewhere where he would have to bend over to see it. Doesn't matter if it's something like a package of ore. If my dad has to bend over to find it, he's never going to find it. I've tested it with my own snacks when I was still living with them to confirm it works. He'd be mad if he knew how many snacks we'd hidden from him simply because he doesn't bend over low enough to see it in the cabinet. 3. I wanted my husband to quit wearing denim shorts because they made him look old. He had gained a bit of weight, so I kept buying his shorts in his old size 34. And I bought khaki shorts in a 38. He will never read a label for any reason. He would put on the jorts and then lay on the bed and lift And spread his legs to stretch out the shorts a bit. He blew out the back seam of two pairs in the same day, then ended up putting on the khaki shorts. Since then, almost 20 years, he has insisted that khaki shorts are made better and fit more comfortably than denim shorts of the same size. Four the remote didn't disappear. I accidentally put it through the washing machine and destroyed it and threw it out in a panic. 5. I only put spiders outside when she sees them. If they're only noticed by me, I let them continue hunting bugs, sometimes with a few soft words of encouragement. You're doing a great job, little guy.

One HR hired an employee to work on the mine I manage. He showed up 45 minutes late wearing shorts and Crocs. I proceeded to fire him on the spot. Got a framed letter from corporate jokingly congratulating me for having the shortest tenured employee in company history. 2. I manage a small weld shop. Generally I don't care about less than clean background checks or pot as long as you come into work every day and get shit done. Finding reliable welders is difficult, so a lot of shit flies. This sometimes leads to weird employees. This one guy we hired stopped showing up after like three days. Days? He walks in the door, he's bright red from being sunburnt to shit, and his clothes are torn to shreds. Dude was drinking on a little aluminum boat and somehow got lost at sea. He looked like Tom Hanks from castaway. He didn't have cell phone reception so he wasn't able to call me. He did take a bunch of pictures over the few days he was lost at sea though, including one where he was being rescued by the Coast Guard. I gave him the rest of the week off. Coast Guard took him to the hospital, he checked himself out and immediately came into work. Didn't even go home and shower. Odd. Dude three. Watched a cashier ring up his friend and pretty much give him everything. For free. Nobody likes the store, but don't make it so obvious. 4 I once fired a guy and he tried to go back to work. His crush was in the clock in room. When I had to tell him to leave again, he cried on my shoulder as I walked him out of the building. Not because I fired him, but because I told him to leave in front of his crush.

I was in a relationship with a twin for several years. The sex was amazing. We had many good times. Best brother I could have ever asked for. 3, when I was younger, I fell in love with a twin. She was amazing but was dating someone at the time. Her sister ended up liking me a lot, so I figured it was the next best thing. Turns out it wasn't. And it only made not being with the one that I wanted to that much harder. We ended up breaking up and they moved somewhat away. One day I get a knock at my door. It was the one I always wanted to be with looking me up because she always knew and felt the same. Nothing really came of it in the end, just like telling people that I banged twins. 4, while my girlfriend's twin sister looks identical, she has a very different personality.

And A little coped out. The sister's boyfriend was passed out in the room next door and she was completely nude, flipping her shit about god knows what. I had just started dating this girl and this was the first time I was staying over in her bed. My girlfriend was horrified and quickly ushered her sister out the door and locked it behind her. I just awkwardly laughed. She broke down crying. I said, hey, that was weird, but it's okay. Don't worry. Thinking she was embarrassed by her sister's behavior, she said, no, it's not that. I just didn't want you to know what I looked like naked yet coming out of shock, I was like, oh, that's right.

One. This one is for New York residents. If you go to the Waldorf Towers Hotel, walk to the end of the reception lobby and you'll find a bowl of the biggest, most juiciest apples ever. They're for paying residents only, so walking in from the main entrance just to grab one will reveal you to be a ruffian just out for a free apple. This is what you will need to do. Enter the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, get the lift to the 44th floor, get out and walk clockwise until you find the Waldorf Towers lift. Get in and o head down to reception. Now you will emerge from the lifts looking like a paying resident and you can grab an apple from the bowl and continue on your merry way. The whole process takes around 7 minutes, but it's so worth it for that apple. That juicy, succulent motherfucker. PS I last did this several times when I was in NY back in 2,010. The only thing I can't remember exactly is the number of which floor to get off. I think it's 44, but I'm not too sure. Regardless, when you're in the lift, select the floor on which all the ballrooms and banqueting suites are situated on. That's the floor which spreads over both the Waldorf Astoria and the Waldorf Towers, and thus has lifts for both hotels. Good luck comrades! Two for every family Or single person making $30,000 or less per year. The IRS will file your taxes for you for free. If you go to a local branch during their specified hours, they will have their own agent look through your stuff and find basically everything you're qualified to receive. This is great for college students and anyone else who may need to catch up or has never done their taxes before. When I was able to do this, the IRS people were super friendly and worked tirelessly to get me everything they could think of. I also didn't see many other people there, so I guess they were glad to be doing something. 3. Crazy loophole if you're a celebrity you can break any law you want and never go to jail. 4. If you feel like checking out the views at Las Vegas's Stratosphere, go to the bar at the top. You can pay $35 or $40 for two people to ride the elevator to the observation deck. Or you can ride to the bar for free and spend that on overpriced booze instead.

During World War 2, an American airplane crashed near the Japanese island of Chichijima. There were nine servicemen on board. One was rescued by an American submarine. The other eight were taken in by the Japanese. Don't want to go into all the details, but through some time and events, the Japanese ended up eating those servicemen. But that's not the weird part. The one serviceman who was rescued, that was George HW. Bush. 2, there was a French doctor during WWII who promised Jewish refugees to help them to leave Europe. When they came to his house on the day of departure with their most precious belongings, he would give them a special vaccine since they were allegedly going to South America. He killed them all, took their stuff, also made them pay some high fee for his help in the first place and dissolved their corpses in his basement with acid. 3, there is a recording of Jim Jones's speech during the night at Jonestown where the hundreds of people drank arsenic laden juice and committed suicide. You can hear them dying in the background and his sheer delirium is absolutely chilling. Also, the entire Jonestown incident is horrifying. There is a really good documentary about it on Netflix called witness to Jonestown. I highly recommend. Four, the Jamie Bulger incident. Two young English boys at 12 years old took a little toddler out of the Mall into an abandoned railroad where they bludgeoned him to death with rocks.

Except for one crucial difference. Instead of a generic alien body, the aliens behind the invasion are ETS. You find out in the last few seconds of the movie that you've been watching. A sequel to what you thought was a cuddly family friendly movie about a young boy and his alien buddy, but was actually about how a naive little kid thwarted authorities and help the alien scout who laid the groundwork for an invasion and attempted genocide 2.

One, I once had both a cat and a Guinea pig some 25 years ago and they seem to hate each other. Whenever my cat got near the cage, the Guinea pig would start squealing aggressively at the cat and the cat would SWAT at the cage while sporting a look of utter disgust. That was a daily routine. It was the first thing that happened in the morning and it lasted a minute. Then they didn't bother each other for the rest of the day and the cat could even nap on top of the cage at times without any protest for either. It was just part of the day for them. That drama just had to happen every day. They went on like that for 7 years. The Guinea pig got really sick because he was old and I realize he doesn't have long left. I picked him up out of the cage and put him on my lap so he didn't have to die alone. The fucking cat came up and licked the Guinea pig and laid on my lap beside him until he passed. Apparently the cat loved him all along. The seven year drama was just their thing. That still amazes me. 2. My roommate has two large male dogs and I have a small female dog. My roommate's male dogs like to rough house and play around sometimes whenever They get too loud. My little dog will raise her head and growl ever so slightly just enough for them to hear her. As soon as she does, they stop for a minute and start playing quieter. Fucking surreal to see. 3. I have a cat, a puppy and a dog. Cat likes to lure the puppy under the bed and he can get under but get stuck in the middle where it's the lowest. I have to rescue him usually around 2:00am and he wakes me up by scratching the floor trying to get out. Cat also likes to knock off things from the counter he knows puppy should not be chewing on. Puppy and cat like to wrestle with each other, but dog doesn't like the ruckus and barks at them to stop. Cat doesn't like the barking, so then he chases dog. Puppy follows cat and there's a train of three, Tom and Jerry style through the house. At the end of the day, though, they are always in a big cuddle pile, so I think they'll be okay. Four. The dog doesn't like when the cat gives him dirty looks. The cat knows this, will deliberately stare him down and then expertly leap out of the way when he goes to chase her. 5. In college, we lived in the second floor and would leave the sliding glass door open with the screen door shut. On nice days. We'd often come home to find my dog Stuck on the balcony. We figured out that my roommate's cat was opening the screen door to let the dog out and then closing the door.

What's the most embarrassing situation where you've been mistaken for your twin? One, my twin brother recommended a restaurant to me, said that he and his wife went there all the time. Good food, really friendly staff. So I took my wife there. Food was as advertised, but the service somewhere between cold and openly hostile, like they resented our presence. I was puzzled by the contrast between what I'd heard and what I saw. Suddenly from the front of the restaurant, explosion of laughter, much rapid talking. Suddenly the waitress is there smiling and all, just as my brother and his wife walk around the corner. They thought my brother was cheating on his wife with some blonde. Yeah, it's funny now. 2, I was dating a girl in college. The first time I went to her house, she opened the door. I told her I liked what she did to her hair and kissed her. She kissed me. We went inside. She then yells, your boyfriend is here. They were weird girls. 3. Not a twin, just Asian. Constantly asked at work about projects I am not involved in. Realize co workers think I am the other Asian guy. 4. Not me, but a co worker has two sets of twin daughters. The younger pair are identical and both work at the same McDonald's. The manager often puts one on the pay window and the other on the food window just to mess with Customers. 5, I've been called my twin sister's name my whole life. So one day I accidentally introduced myself to someone as her. When I caught and corrected myself they thought I was straight up crazy for not knowing my own name. 6, a friend and his wife go to the same supermarket every week. His identical twin also goes there with his wife. One day after summoning up the courage, the cashier pulls my friend's wife aside and says, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but I've seen your husband here several times with another woman. 7, my friend said hi to his brother one morning. Well, it turns out his brother was actually his own reflection in a window. His mom witnessed it and has never let him live it down. 8, my twin had recently committed suicide and I was at a bar drinking away my rage and a friend of his came up and flipped out on me saying how awful of a joke it was and took everything I had not to remove their teeth with my fist.

My upstairs neighbors were taking turns zapping each other with a stun gun, hitting the floor, groaning in pain, and then laughing like Beavis and Butthead. 2. Someone sneezed, we said bless you, they laughed. Three. I heard my neighbor giving his granddaughter a xylophone for her birthday. I guess she could play it well and kept playing for a while. Immediately after she left, I could hear him trying to play something his granddaughter had played. He practiced for a solid hour until he managed to play the song correctly and stopped with a joyful yes! It was one of the purest things I've ever experienced. Four. Yesterday while I was taking a shit, my neighbor was blasting classical music at full volume. It was the most majestic and relaxing shit I've taken in a long time. Five you were only with me for the crack. My next door neighbors 6. What can only be described as my flatmate having phone sex while using Christian Bale's Batman voice. 7. I moved from far away so I have a different state license plate than everyone else at the apartment complex. A couple of days ago I overheard my upstairs neighbor drunkenly ranting to his wife about what he thinks I'm up to. He's convinced I'm on the run from something. I'm just in grad school lol. 8. My upstairs neighbors were a single mom and her teenage daughter They were very loud. The mom's room was above mine. One day I had the day off and was woken up by the sound of sex upstairs. It had been pretty common over the previous couple of weeks. This time though, someone came in and started screaming you are having sex in my bed! Turns out the daughter had been skipping school and coming back to the apartment with her boyfriend. They were the ones having sex in the mom's bed. The fight that ensued should have earned both women awards. 9. I lived next to a couple some years ago and they came home after a night out and started fighting about who was better at darts. I thought they were joking, but it got pretty heated. Doors were slammed.

One. They are really calm during a crisis, but not necessarily when the crisis is passed. Two. They don't ask for help because people have let them down a lot. Three. Exceptional situational awareness. They know where people around them are and generally everything happening around them. 4. Memory problems. 5. They appear distant or emotionally reserved, especially when it comes to personal topics, and struggle with opening up or letting people in. 6. When closing a door, they turn the door knob, push the door in, then release the knob so that it closes as quietly as possible. Seven. They don't know how to accept kindness or are suspicious of it. 8. Chill to the point of detachment. They've stopped caring about most things because caring too much used to hurt. 9. They sit and watch in social settings, very observant. 10. They are funny. 11. There's nothing you can say that will surprise them. They know how messed up the world is. They know what people can do, even the good ones. 12. Not only do they not ask for help, they don't like to burden others with whatever is going on. 13. They apologize for everything. 14. Children get a hardened look in their eyes and they look like adults in children's bodies, and it's honestly pretty unsettling once you've seen it. 15. They overdo everything and are mostly givers.

When he asked my grandmother if she'd ever had children. 2. I told him I had to leave in 1.5 hours. He told me that was oddly specific and I should have rounded up to 2 hours instead of 1 hour and 50 minutes. I clarified that I had to leave in 1 hour and 30 minutes and he said that's actually 1.3 hours. 3. What kind of bird is a ham? Was hard to ignore. 4. When he ran out of gas while in line at the Starbucks drive through right across the street from the gas station. I told him to get gas first because his car was low, but he really needed that iced caramel macchiato. I asked why he didn't listen to me and he replied with I thought I could make it. He ended up pushing the car through the drive through and got his coffee while doing so. Then park the car in the lot and call the tow to tow it back home instead of the gas station across the street. No, he did not get any gas that day. He waited until his dad got off work to bring a three gallon jug of gasoline because I refused to enable that crap. 5. How do oil companies know where to build gas stations? She thought that there was a gasoline bubble underground that they would tap into and run a line straight to The pump. She was working for Chevron. 6 I was having bad cramps and I took an Advil. My ex told me I shouldn't take them because it's a gazebo. 7 she seemed to be confused about the difference between flamingos and penguins, but insisted they weren't real because she'd grown up in Alaska and never seen any. 8 she had a new telescope and thought it would be really cute to check out the stars after a date one night. I don't remember the full conversation, but at some point I joked about us being stuck together on this giant ball in space. She looked through the telescope again and said, so you believe that, huh? I just stared at her blankly because I was afraid of that question going any further. Anyways, happy to share that we didn't last long, but did you guys know that there's totally, like, a lot of evidence that our planet is probably not round? Nine wait, the Romans are from Rome? 10 I was going into anaphylactic shock at a restaurant due to unknown allergy. My throat was closing and I had no neck due to swelling. He asked if I wanted to go outside to get some air. We were sitting on the patio.

Just for context, I'm Polish. I truly believe that Americans have this weird thing about believing in themselves. For example, I don't believe I will become the person I wanna be. I don't believe I will achieve anything in my life. I don't believe I will be happy in my life. Then I watch people from America who believe they can do anything and they just go for it. Does it always work? No, but it gives them a way higher chance than mine when I don't believe. Two, 21 years ago, the United States was able to deploy forces halfway across the world, roll into Baghdad and conquer Iraq in less than one month with only a few hundred American deaths. By contrast, Russia still hasn't even gotten to Kiev after three years of fighting, despite Ukraine being Russia's neighbor. And Russia has suffered 750,000 dead and wounded in the process. 3. Enthusiasm. I live in Ireland and we're all miserable pricks, as are most Europeans. But when we meet Americans, we're always amazed at the enthusiasm and energy they have for even the most mundane stuff. I once saw a bunch of American tourists shout, oh, freaking hell yeah, let's go, and high five each other because they managed to fit all their luggage and groceries into the car. If that was me and my buds, we'd be like, ah, nice. Four national parks courtesy of Theodore Roosevelt. 5. I could be wrong, but I'm in Australia and I love the way Americans go all out for holidays, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas. It all looks so fun.

One starlight from the boys. At first I thought it was CGI and part of her character, but then I realized she's had horrible surgery. She looks so much better in the earlier seasons, but now she looks drastically different, almost unrecognizable. 2. Simon Cowell I feel like Simon Cowell from 20 years ago would ridicule and lambaste current Simon worse than he ever did with any crazy X Factor or American Idol contestant. His excessive plastic surgery has altered his appearance significantly. 3. The Kardashian Jenner clan they immediately come to mind. A lot of younger celebrities seem to be following the trend of overusing fillers and Botox. Combined with buckle fat removal, it's aging them horribly, making them look middle aged well before they turn 34. Lindsay Lohan. I know she's been through a lot, but the plastic surgery hasn't helped. She was one of the first people my age that I saw undergo extensive cosmetic work, and it was sobering to witness the transformation. 5. Ariana Grande she's still really young and started out naturally beautiful, but she's already started looking a bit uncanny. You don't usually see this level of plastic surgery until someone reaches their 40s. It's surprising and a little disheartening.

My daughter was the prettiest girl in high school and she always had boys showing up at our house hoping to confess their love. She rejected all of them, but unfortunately, one of the boys didn't take it well. He started harassing her everywhere. He would hide in a tree near our house and as soon as my daughter left for school, he would follow her, claiming it was to keep her safe. But one day, my daughter caught him taking photos through her bedroom window. Even at school, he never left her alone and would constantly invade her personal space, saying that friends should hug each other often. I reported his behavior to the teachers, but they said they couldn't control what a student did outside of school. They promised to try and stop the bullying, but things only got worse from there. He started showing up at our house, knocking on my daughter's window when I wasn't home, demanding to be let in. He spread rumors that they were hooking up every day and insisted they were obviously soulmates, all in an attempt to pressure my daughter into dating him. One day he took things way too far. I had just left for work when he decided to break my daughter's window and force his way into the house. He started screaming for her to stop hiding, saying that he would only hurt her if she resisted. He was laughing the entire Time acting like he was invincible. What he didn't know, however, was that I had taught my daughter how to defend herself in situations like this. She ran to the kitchen and grabbed the biggest knife she could find. Then she hid it behind her back and calmly asked him to leave. The boy didn't listen. He charged at her and in that moment, she reacted, impaling him in the stomach. He died from blood loss shortly after. My daughter was only 16 at the time. Although this experience was deeply traumatic for her, she was never charged with murder. The incident was ruled as self defense.

When they explain something, they make you feel intelligent. Three. Explaining something complex is simple terms. Knowledge is so vast that they can talk about in the easiest way for someone else to understand. 4. They spend time thinking before asking a question or answering. 1. 5. They're very good at problem solving, even if it's something they have no experience with. They always approach the problem from the right angle. 6. They can genuinely consider an idea which opposes their world view without necessarily accepting it. 7. They can switch up the way they talk to match the person they're talking to without sounding condescending. They listen to how others learn and explain it in that person's language of understanding. 8. They aren't afraid to say they don't know the answer to a question. 9. Understanding or appreciating nuance. 10. They are okay with being perceived as stupid by asking questions. If we hold back in fear we'll never truly learn. Plus it's a good way to show others it's okay to question things if you don't understand. Better off if we're on the same page instead of hoping things work out without being informed.

Honestly, I got rejected by a girl who seemed to send very obvious signs, so I don't know anything anymore. 2. I've heard you can tell by where they put their feet, like if they put their feet behind their ears, they really like you. 3, a girl flirted with me in French, stole my bag under the table as a joke, wanted to arm wrestle and sat in the pub with me for 7 hours. She could have been Canadian, so I never knew if she liked me or not. Second date is today. 4, I tell my wife about a weird interaction I had with a waitress lady at the store, etc. Then she tells me that woman was hitting on me. Apparently I'm oblivious. 5. Looking back on my time in college, I got some pretty clear signs that I completely missed. If a girl invites you back to her dorm because she forgot something and then can't remember what she was going back to get and then sits on her bed and just kind of looks at you, that's a pretty clear sign. I think about that occasionally. I can't believe I missed that. 1. 6, laughing at everything I say. It's how I recognized my girlfriend. Like me, I could say virtually anything and I could see her laughing. 7, if you see that person hiding in a tree outside your window. 8. I Like things to be very clear and obvious. So I insist on waiting for them to issue me a Section 3.02 notice intention to pursue romantically, which will set out their detailed five year plan for us and describe the boundaries of their proposed pursuit, including likes, dislikes and information on any allergies.

One, the person you strapped yourself to for a tandem skydive was up until 3:00am doing cookies last night. Two, the best time to buy a car is the second model year of its release. Year one, it's patchwork to just get them off the line. Year two, everything is fixed and has quality content. Year three, plus Oems give incentives to make parts cheaper and to discontent to improve margins. 3. Sometimes when a job is posted and the requirements are unrealistic, that's because they already have someone that needs to be promoted to that specific position and they simply tailor that job ad so only that person qualifies even if hundreds of people apply. 4. Political propaganda. TV hosts and speakers don't believe that shit themselves and are very cynical about it like it's just a job like any other. 5. The signal strength bars on your phone don't mean anything real. Each phone manufacturer comes up with their own secret formula. It might change between software versions and it's just a holdover from the old first generation analog phones. When received signal strength was the only important metric. 4G and 5G networks are way too complex to distill into one bar graph but customers are used to it so phones still have it. 6. Many therapists need therapy themselves, sometimes a lot of it. 7. The massive professional quality cinema projectors that movie theaters. Use the ones that can project crystal clear 4 K+ images. The ones linked to top notch surround systems that make movies come to life. The ones so big they have a giant exhaust hose. They have regular HDMI ports on the side. 8, utility construction, primarily fiber. The majority of the subcontractors have no idea what they're actually doing and are just following the instructions like it's IKEA furniture. 9, your call isn't really important to us.

I worked in retail at the time. After they initially sold out, by the time we got new stock in, nobody wanted them anymore. They all got cleared out, probably because schools banned them almost immediately. 2, the sea shanty craze. Remember that one random week when everyone was suddenly into sea shanties for some reason? 3, Segways. Does the existence of the Segway count as a trend? It was hyped as the future of transportation, but it never really caught on. 4, the 3D craze. Around 2010, everyone thought 3D was the future. After Avatar came out, every movie tried to be 3D. Then came 3d TVs, 3D phones, and a Nintendo 3Ds. The craze died out in about a year, likely because it gave people headaches and was more of a gimmick than an improvement. 5. The summer of Pokemon Go. The summer of Pokemon Go was incredible. People were up and outside walking around, getting exercise. Strangers met and chatted. And for a brief moment, it was cool to be social. Then, if I remember correctly, an app update broke the game and its popularity dropped off drastically. Ironically, about four years later, Covid 19 happened and we were all stuck indoors. A complete opposite of that one wonderful summer of Pokemon Go.

One when my ex and I got into dumb arguments or debates, we'd send it to council for review. There was no council. There would be no review. It was our way of shelving an argument that would never have a winner. Occasionally, we'd ask each other if we heard back from council about the judgment. Two. My husband and I have a game we call business, business. The goal is to clasp the other person's right hand, fully shake it twice, and say business, business. If the other person pulls their hand away or shouts business, business at the same time, it's a failed attempt. There's no score, but the last successful handshake holder is the reigning champion until dethroned. This started as an inside joke, but has spiraled into a full on competition, including notable wins, like at my uncle's funeral while reaching for a water bottle in the middle of the desert, and during heated arguments. Now whenever we try to hold hands, there's always a moment of hesitation to ensure it's not a ploy. 3. When the laundry comes out of the dryer, my partner dumps the warm pile on me, and I sort socks and underwear from inside the heap. Meanwhile, he hangs up shirts and folds pants. We call it Laundry Turtle. 4. He absolutely must touch my butt at least once every time we go to Walmart. I can't even remember how This started, but it feels weird if we forget. 5. We have a dollar Bill that fell between the washer and dryer during laundry one day. Neither of us could be bothered to fish it out, so we left it there for over a year. Eventually we acknowledged it and decided to leave it as a symbol of our wealth. We've added a quarter to it now it's our emergency fund. 6. We wrestle for fun. Not in a sexy or playful let the other one way, but as a legit competition. 7. We often stand in each other's way for no reason other than to be annoying. 8. We have a mating dance that has evolved over the decade we've been together. It includes moves like slapping one's own butt, moving arms like a Choo Choo train, and one handed clapping. Some moves go out of fashion year by year, but our repertoire is significant.

My ex seemed to think I was interested in hearing about how he got down with women before me. No thanks, dude. 3. Showing off flexing or comparing yourself to others in order to brag. Some guys think it makes them look cool, but it just makes them look insecure. 4. Having massive junk. At a certain point it just hurts and feels annoying. 5. Being a nice guy. Women want a guy who is nice, not a disciplined pet who does whatever they say. 6. Driving stupidly with me in the car to try and show off. It's an absolute no for me. Seven obnoxiously loud vehicles. You think you're impressing them, but look closer at their faces. Nine times out of 10 that's a sneer, not a smile. Eight tough guy behavior, like starting fights in public over shit that's not worth a fight. You don't look big and bad, just embarrassing. 9. So many men consider not having basic hygiene of flex or something masculine. Dude, you'll never find a woman who's into this. Please look after yourself. 10. Anyone who claims to be an alpha. It's the dumbest shit I've ever heard. Genuine, gentle sweetheart guys are 1,000 times more attractive.

When I ordered a small drink, it was actually small. 2. The only thing that really surprised me was how much pedestrians trusted cars to not hit them. 3. The age of all the buildings. Walked into a pub in the UK with a plaque that reads something like, this building was constructed in the year 2 and was used by monks to fend off dinosaurs. Maybe not the exact words, but you get it. 4. I went to Scotland, ran across some German tourists who asked us to translate what the Scott was saying. We were all three speaking English. They just couldn't understand each other. 5. You hear about how big the Roman Empire was and all the advanced building tech they had, but it doesn't really sink in until you see it with your own eyes. 6. In France, people get two hour lunches. Like some stores will have two separate open and close times cause they'll just shut down for two hours a day to enjoy themselves. Most people seemed much happier and relaxed as a whole. 7. That tax was included on the price tag. 8. I'm Dutch, but I'll never forget my American girlfriend's reaction to seeing rows and rows of parked bicycles in front of the train station when she came to visit the Netherlands. Oh my god, look at all those bikes. 9 in Italy, the shower at one of My hotels had no barriers to keep the water in one general area. It was just a drain in the floor. Luckily, it was just that one, and it was definitely an older hotel. 10, the amount of public transportation, and in many places, people not driving or not even knowing how to drive. Even young children were using public transportation, not escorted by adults to get to school. Eleven, I heard a story of a lady who was dumbfounded that there weren't going to be fireworks celebrating the 4th of July. Couldn't conceive the idea that other countries don't celebrate America's Independence Day. 12, I was in Switzerland for a few days. I felt like the fattest person in the country at 6 feet, 210 pounds. 13. Personal bubble is very different. It shocks you at first and you feel sort of claustrophobic, but then you get used to it. Two, it's kind of subtle until you come back to the States and unconsciously stand so close to someone else in a line that they start shooting you dirty looks.

Steven Seagal. 2. Any of the Kardashians. I stopped watching American Horror Stories cause Kim is in them now. 3. James Corden. He's even terrible in his own show. 4, Kevin Hart. His talent is being Kevin Hart in movies that don't need him to be. Five, when I was younger, I really didn't like Shelly Duvall. Her whiny, yelling and tear ridden performance in The Shining and her being olive oil. I thought she was the worst. As an adult, I was able to see that she was just a great actress that performed both of those roles to absolute perfection. Like Joffrey in game of Thrones. Their performance was entirely convincing and gave you a visceral reaction to the character. 6, Jada Pinkett. 7, I am begging Hollywood to stop putting Jared Leto in things. 8, Cara Delevingne, Total Talent Vacuum. 9, Nick Cannon. Jesus almost ruined B99. 10, Lena Dunham. Oh my god, insufferable. 11, Dwayne Johnson. You just know the movie won't have any substance. 12, Dakota Johnson. If I hear she's in something, I won't watch. 13, Jennifer Lopez. 14. I have nothing against Chris Pratt, but I'd like it if he wasn't in everything ever anymore. 15. This may be a hot take, but Blake Lively.

One, in high school, I woke up on a day where very icy weather was expected and couldn't find school closings on TV. I begrudgingly got ready for school, stepped out my front door and immediately slipped on ice, landing flat on my back. Got up, shook it off and cursed the school for not being closed. I had to crawl my way up a hill to the bus stop because I kept slipping down ice on the way there. Got to the bus stop and waited over half an hour for it to get there. Check my watch repeatedly, getting more and more angry each time. Finally decide that they must have canceled school and slowly make it back home where I see a clock. It was now 2:00am. 2. I once was cooking Mac and cheese and started squeezing the cheese sauce in before draining the water. When I realized the mistake, I grabbed the cheese sauce with my hands and it just made everything worse in every way. 3, birthday is March 12th. In high school, I saw that my birthday was going to fall on a Thursday, so I was like, oh wow, Thursday the 12th. I proceeded to scan the next couple of decades on my iPod touch calendar to find out if my birthday would ever fall on Friday the 13th. 4. I recently went to pick up an order of glasses. The optician asked me To try them on to see if they fit well. I told him this must be someone else's order because everything was blurry. He was surprised and started hunting through boxes and I kept squinting and looking around at blurry shapes. We did this for 10 minutes before the optometrist walked in. He explained the issue and the optometrist paused and asked where I put the glasses I was wearing when I walked in. I said I was wearing contacts. I was wearing contacts and I put the new glasses over my contacts. I asked the optometrist if this gave me double the perfect vision and she replied, if you mean double vision, sure. 5. During the holidays, I walked through an arts and crafts store trying to find something very specific. After finding out they didn't have it, I got in a long line to check out. It didn't hit me that I didn't have anything to buy until it was my turn. I just walked past the cashier, waved and said, have a nice day. It was night f my life. 6, wondering if lime was real word or if I made it up.

If you're passionate about what you do, you won't work a day in your life. Wrong. It's still really hard work even though you enjoy it. And to make matters worse, you might work so hard to the point where you end up hating the thing you love. 2. Tilt your head back during a bloody nose. You don't want to flood your throat with nose blood. 3. You should spend two months wages on an engagement ring as a marketing slogan. 4, that people are good eyewitnesses. We aren't. Our perception of things sucks. We are prone to so many biases that we aren't even aware of. If I grade papers on an empty stomach, I will grade them lower than if I am not hungry. And I will never admit that to be true, even though it is. 5. In medical school, we're taught that common things are common and that when you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras. Meaning that we should always assume the most obvious diagnosis. Medical students almost always jump to the rarest disease when taking multiple choice tests or when they first go out into clinical rotations and see real patients. 6. You don't need to wait 30 minutes before going swimming after eating. This was just invented by public pools to stop people bringing food into the water. 7. Put ice on a burn. Do not do this. It can rip the skin. Do put The burn under cool water immediately. 8, you hold your breath. If you run out of air while scuba diving wrong, your lungs will explode as you'll float upwards with a lung full of air, and you probably will try to surface anyway. And the air inside them expands. The proper procedure is to scream all the way up to make sure your airways are open. 9. Don't trust someone who won't look you in the eyes. Having social anxiety doesn't make you a bad person, and sociopaths have no problem staring you down.

One, I had a coworker when I was a manager in a major retailer. We were running a project that required third party hiring. Well, in this team was a group of 7 POC who rode together for work. Whenever I was around, they were hard working and quick to listen. But whenever I was at a different location or off for a few days, I would come back and this manager would brief me on how things went. And every time she would bring up how terrible and rude and lazy this group was. And when I would go out to the floor, they would greet me with things like thank god you're back. We were about to quit. It went on like this until one day I was coming back halfway through shift drive time and the group was leaving clearly pissed off, said they couldn't stand her racist ass anymore. Apparently she accused them of being disrespectful and probably stealing like you people do. They ended up filing a case and reporting her. I was told I was going to have to provide testimony as the only other manager present. Right before I got on the call, she actually said, you know, I'm not racist. I have even dated a darky. I was floored. I held nothing back in the testimony. 2 speaking for people of color but getting pissed at people of color for Speaking for themselves. 3, refer to a black person as clean and groomed as if it's something rare and special. Every time a black person applied for a job at my old job, this old white lady who was involved in interviews would say he was clean and didn't have those dreads or something similar. 4.

I was hired by the store manager through a friend's referral. I loved computers, so my job was to stay in the computer department and sell them, nothing else. One shift manager didn't like that and insisted I needed to go fold clothes for half my shift. I told him the store manager instructed me never to leave the technology department, but he insisted. This went on for several weeks. The store manager showed up one weekend when we were both working. He slapped a stack of green bar paper, this was a while ago, onto a shelf and pointed to some highlighted numbers. He looked at the shift manager and said, do you see this? This is our average tech sales when you're on shift. See this number over here? This is our average tech sales when you're not. At this point, it would be more cost effective to simply fire you. What do you think? The guy stammered like a toddler caught bullying another kid. Fortunately, he wasn't fired, but the store manager made it clear that when I was on shift, I Was not to leave the tech department unless I was on break or there was a fire.

What in the world just doesn't work properly for you? One. I know nobody uses them anymore, but I used to dream about owning a camera that let me click the shutter with my left hand so I could hold this really expensive object steady with my dominant hand. Two ballpoint pens. They are designed for the ball to be pulled across the paper. When you're a lefty, you push it across the paper and a lot of them do not write correctly because of it. Three power tools. All of the grips, angles, and exhaust are designed for right hand operation. Same with vacuums. Four. Haven't seen anyone say this yet, but tutorials, especially for things like crocheting. I have to mirror everything in my head. Five chairs for students. When there are individual chairs. Have writing pad on the right hand side. That sucks. Six brooms where the stick screws into the brush part. The way I naturally grip a broom and sweep causes it to gradually unscrew itself until the brush part falls off. So I have to swap which hand is on top and my entire stance. So my sweeping motion will constantly screw the stick and brush tighter together instead. It's easily manageable, but sometimes at the end of a long day of work, you're tired sweeping up and not thinking about having to do it opposite. The broom detaches. Seven mugs always have the pattern printed on the wrong side. 8 I'm aware that Scissors just don't work for some reason. What other mundane things do you struggle with? 9. Whiteboards, 10 spiral bound notebooks, pen openers, lead pencils and certain gel pen smudges. You write? Certain computer mice if you're like me and only want to use one. Left handed. Thank god for left handed gaming mice. 11. Credit card readers. Always angled for right handers. 12. Nothing anymore. I've adapted and overcome and now I'm far more dexterous and versatile than you right handed idiots.

Your parents are literally the worst part of my job. 2. Yes, I put you in a group with the kids you have a crush on intentionally. I'm stuck here with you 180 days a year. I want to see some drama. 3. Stop wearing your furry tail. Everyone is uncomfortable. 4. I am no longer a teacher, but I remember several days I felt lazy and wanted to give the class the day off. I never did because I knew the teacher's pet would rat me out. Sometimes even the teachers don't like the teacher's pet. Five the weed smell doesn't magically disappear between the parking lot and my classroom. 6. If your parents email a teacher and argue with them, the whole staff knows. 7. We have much better hearing than you assume. We just choose our battles when it comes to inappropriate comments. And sometimes I pretend not to see the thing you did because I found it humorous and talking to you about it would only result in me cracking up. 8. If I know your name by the third day of the school year, that means you're probably an asshole. 9. When you think you're being genius by getting me to talk about random things at the beginning of class instead of teaching, I'm really allowing it to happen because I Don't have enough plan to cover a full class. 10. I'm a bus driver. Sit your butt down. You will die if I crash. 11. My students are the reason I'm second guessing having my own kids. 12. Please stop drooling in the classrooms. That's what the bathrooms are for. 13. It's just as weird for me as it is for you when we bump into each other in public. 14. I don't care that you came to class stoned. Just stop interrupting class. And for God's sake, don't touch any power tools while you're stoned. 15. I knew you were cheating, so I gave you a test with the answers in a different order for the rest of the semester. You clearly weren't bright enough to figure it out. And yes, I am that spiteful. It was easier than reporting the cheating. 16. One day you're going to come across people who are not being paid to tolerate you, and all of a sudden, life is going to become considerably more difficult. 17. I encourage my worst kids as much or more than my favorites because I don't want them back in my class next year. 18. I can smell you. Everyone can. Please, for the love of god, use deodorant.

My friend got his hearing at age 6. He swears to this day that he thought flowers would make some sort of noise and that's what attracted bees. 2. My cousin was born deaf and underwent an operation to recover part of his hearing when he was twelve. He sometimes uses hearing aids, but can get by without them. His family had a bunny. Of course, he had Learned about cows mooing, cats meowing, etc. Before his surgery. He was very shocked when he came home and greeted his bunny to find that it made no sound. It took him the longest time to understand that bunnies are pretty quiet animals in general. He explained that he thought all pets were loud. Three. My dad's lifelong best friend was born with hearing but lost it before age 2 due to health issues. He went his entire childhood deaf, and in his 20s finally got a hearing aid. At the time, he and his wife were living downtown in a large city. Apparently he had the hearing aid for about two weeks before he threw it out, saying everything was too loud. He hated the noise and sound, saying things were more peaceful without it. Fifteen years later, he moved out into the country on a few hundred acres of woods. Still, he refused to wear a hearing aid and kept Refusing for the next 10 years, finally, his wife convinced him to give it a try, and his mind was blown. He couldn't believe how quiet everything was and how much he enjoyed hearing. He explained that he had thought the noise of the traffic downtown was the wind, and that it sounded like that everywhere, all the time. So for 25 years, he thought wind sounded like the hundreds of cars driving by. 4 my three year old son is deaf, and we just had a visit this morning from his signing teacher, who is also deaf herself. She recently had cochlear implants fitted. While we were talking and signing, she said, I'm sorry, I can't concentrate. I can hear a horrible constant noise. It hasn't stopped the whole time I've been here. It turned out it was the rain on my conservatory roof. 5 I had a childhood friend who gained hearing and didn't realize you could control the volume of your voice. When I whispered to her, she said, hang on, I think I need to adjust my hearing aid. At first I just thought, oh, it must not be working. Until I realized what was going on. She whispered to me for about two weeks straight just to practice.

One. Sometimes I'll have one random hair that grows out of my arm that has the consistency of plastic and is almost clear. My mom gets it too. It's just one hair. Two. My left leg makes cracking sounds when I walk upstairs. I'm only 20 years old. 3. There's an indent on my right foot where a horse stepped on it. I never went to a doctor about it and I assume it was broken, but it's been almost 20 years. 4. I experienced something called exploding head syndrome, which is much less severe than the name might imply. Basically, sometimes right as I'm on the edge of sleep, I'll hear a loud auditory hallucination that jolts me back awake. Pretty rare though. It only happens to me maybe once a month. Five. When I blow my nose, my left eye bubbles from the corner like air is coming through. Freaks me out every time because it feels so weird. 6. I used to have a hedgehog named Velcro. I'd let him run around on my bed. One morning I slid out of bed and got a sharp pain in my left ass cheek. I walked to the bathroom and saw that I had a half inch quill lodged firmly in my haunch. I pulled out what I could and thought I got it all. It wept a few times and Eventually healed. It's been 20 years, and I still have a scab on my ass that falls off once a month and comes back in a few days. I can feel there's something deep under the skin, but because of the bad angle, there's no way I can take care of it without a dermatologist's help. 7. The texture of the skin on my right palm changed after I was sick back in March. Sometimes it's bubbly and really itchy, sometimes it looks tight and glossy, and sometimes it's so dry that the skin cracks. I can definitely see a difference between the right and the left ones. The little lines on my right palm aren't as visible anymore. Eight. I have a singular white eyelash on one of my eyes that grows really quickly and gets so long that it pokes into my actual eye, and I need to cut it every couple of months to keep it short.

A bee sting to the cock can enlarge it permanently. Shout out to the person who discovered it. 2. Michael Jackson's hair caught on fire at the exact median day of his life. He had a literal midlife crisis. 3. If provided with a mirror, dolphins will admire their own genitals. 4. Being steamed alive allows the victim to feel nearly everything because your nerves don't get destroyed as fast as being burned alive, and it's healthier because it preserves the nutrients. 5. Being skinned alive doesn't kill nearly as quickly as you'd think. When done carefully, the victim may not die of blood loss or shock, but rather hypothermia. Some account record that people have survived for several days. 6. If you spill bleach on your skin, the slippery feeling you feel when you wash it off is because you have basically made soap by dissolving the top layer of skin. 7. There is a chemical called MPTP that specifically destroys dopaminergic neurons in the brain. About three days after someone ingests it, they get Parkinson's disease. Eight. Suicide bombers can be easily identified after blowing themselves up, since the pressure from the explosion fractures the neck and sends the head flying away to safety from the explosion. 9. In 1985, a Serbian farmer stuck a beer bottle up his ass broadside first. This sparked a chain of events that eventually LED to The collapse of Yugoslavia. 10. When you are starving and have little body fat left, your body can grow almost fur like hair to insulate itself in absence of fat. 11. Cuttlefish mating is fascinating. The females all hunker down while the big males fight each other for a chance to copulate. While the big tough males are duking it out, small males will kind of pull in their tentacles to look like females, sneak past the fighting males, and mate with the females. Interestingly, female cuttlefish have some control over which sperm makes it to the eggs, and overwhelmingly choose the cutting small male sperm over the big brawny males who come into mate after finishing fighting. Brains over Brawn. 12. Locked in syndrome is a scary condition where you are conscious while in a coma. 13. Octopuses are usually very antisocial, but when they're under the influence of ecstasy, they are more willing to spend time around each other or even hug other octopuses.

You know they're not wanting to talk to you. 6. I wish I could find a guy like you. You're so sweet. 7. One time I was walking to my desk to get something and a girl was by it talking to one of her friends. She looked at me and said Ew with a face of disgust and looked away from me. That killed me a little on the inside. Eight. I'm a girl and I dressed up as Marilyn Monroe for Halloween One year in college. Went to a party. Throughout the night, three different guys accused me of being a man in drag. Feels bad, man. 9. It's always a letdown when people say you look like a celebrity. Stephen Hawking is my most Frequent match Ken. I once had a group therapy session where we stood in a circle and had to say something we liked about the appearance of one another. I don't remember what the point of that was, it was too long ago. Sorry. Anyway, everyone received their compliments beautiful hair, great smile, etc. Until it was my turn to get complimented. They all went silent for a good while until one of them said something along the lines of you are kind of funny sometimes. After that, the therapist just told them to skip to the next person while giving me a sympathetic look. That shit still haunts me.

One, I had a couple that told me to wait before I prebus their table so the man could lick every plate clean first. They had multiple apps and entrees between them and he licked every single one clean before I was allowed to take it. They weren't in a private booth or anything. The other guests could see this happening. 2. I used to work at Olive Garden. There was a lady that would come in at least once a week and she was dubbed by a staff as Pepperoncini Lady. She would want you to open a new bag of the pepperoncini we used in the salads and pour out the juice in a cup. She would literally straight up drink the juice. She would also get a bowl of pepperoncini and just eat them. 3. We had a woman send back a grilled chicken salad because it was cold. So we cooked fresh chicken and made sure to send it out while still warm. She sent it back again. The entire salad wasn't hot enough for her. We microwaved the whole salad. She ate it. 4. Honestly, I'd say the weirdest thing was that while I was a server at a restaurant in the Royal Hawaiian, a guest asked me to book a shark adventure tour. It had nothing to do with my job or even the hotel. Those tours were entirely separate businesses. I took his. Black card, went to guest services, picked up a pamphlet and booked the tour. He tipped me $250. Totally worth it. 5. I used to work at a Japanese restaurant and I once had someone come up to me and asked me if we had any low sodium soy sauce. The request itself was not so strange and I gave him the bottle we kept behind the counter. The strange thing was what he used the soy sauce for, which was pouring some of it into his Pepsi. 6. Once a very thin middle aged woman came in. She couldn't have weighed more than 100 pounds, soaking wet. She asked what our biggest steak was. I told her it was the 24 ounces rib eye. She said, okay, I'll have that. I bring out her steak and she begins eating. She's about a third of the way through when I ask, how is everything? She says, great, bring me another steak. I say, is there anything wrong with that one? She says, no, it's great. I want a second one. I go back to the chef and tell him and he couldn't believe it. But we served her another steak. She ate all 48 ounces of steak and left me a $40 tip.

I have a personal sauce that I make for burgers and she asks if it has mustard in it. I say no. She loves it and I've made it multiple times since then. She's even requested it a few times. Little does she know it has a decent amount of mustard in it. 2. Yes, I would love to travel six hours to see your family. 3, my girlfriend can't sleep sometimes. I told her there is a pressure point on her lower neck that if pressed induces sleepiness. When she can't sleep, I will press on it to placebo her to, into getting tired and falling asleep. 4, me and my husband live in an area where it doesn't rain frequently, but when it does, we get a ton of snails. He would get sad because we'd see some snails that have been stepped on. So I told him that they were an invasive species so he wouldn't feel so bad about them getting smushed. Five, our child took their first steps when I was visiting my parents a few hours away while my husband was at work. Later that evening, he got home shortly after I did, and our daughter took a few steps toward him when he came in the house. He got extremely excited thinking those were her first steps. So I just went with it and got Excited too. She's 14 now. I've never told him the truth. 6. He's a chef and I'm a picky eater. I don't want to complain because he still took the time to make it and I can't cook at all. 7. Yeah, I really enjoy it when your brother and his wife come visit us. Cannot stand either one of them and find his brother to be an obnoxious idiot. 8. I insist that his old man Flemmy Sinus clearing coughs in the morning don't bother me. He can't help it. But man, they are rough and gross to listen to. 9. I've never told my husband what a horrible dancer he is. Horrible. He always wants to dance, but I usually tell him I'm tired or my feet hurt. If the dance floor is crowded, I'll dance with him. But in the middle of the dance floor, surrounded by people. Love that man to death. Though he has a million amazing qualities and I'm the luckiest woman alive also, I'm pretty sure he could name quite a few things about me that he's not too fond of. 10. I never lie to my spouse. Tried once to withhold that I won $500 on a scratch ticket and told on myself before I got my coat off. 11. I don't know if this counts, but I tell my girlfriend I'm hungry so she'll also eat something. 12. I once claimed to have made the sauce for a meal when it Was out of a bottle.

Canonically, Chuck E. Cheese is an orphan who never knew when his birthday was, so he celebrates other people's birthdays to fill the terrible, painful void of his abandonment. 2. Sherman Kelly wrote the lyrics to dancing in the Moonlight while recovering from a violent assault carried out on him and his girlfriend by a youth gang. He envisioned an alternative reality where people just dance and be happy all the time. It was his way of dealing with the trauma. 3. The song save the Last Dance for me by the Drifters was written by a man who was crippled by polio and in a wheelchair, watching his new wife dancing with other men at his wedding to her because he couldn't. 4. For a while, Neopets was owned and operated by Scientologists. They wanted to add religion to it while they had it. 5. Dole the company overthrowing the Queen of Hawaii. 6. When I was 10 or so, my sisters and I were doing a common counting rhyme to pick something, maybe who went first in a game. Eenie, meenie, miney, mo. Catch a tiger by the toe. If he hollers, let him go. Eenie, meenie, miney, mo. My dad walked by and quietly commented, when I was your age, that word wasn't tiger, but we didn't know better back then.

One. My company, as part of its alcohol policy, you should not drink for at least four hours before coming to work. When engineers got called about production problems over the weekend, they all just had a beer, but could be there in about four or five hours. Two. In my dorm, if you did something that triggered the smoke fire alarm, you had to do a safety presentation for everyone on your floor. This was intended to deter pranksters from pulling the alarm. A guy on our floor was making grilled cheese in the kitchenette and burned it, which legitimately triggered the fire alarm. Afterwards, he explained, assuming that since it had been a legitimate alarm and not a prank, that he wouldn't have to do a presentation. He was, of course, wrong. So the next Wednesday night, the entire floor assembled and we were treated to a 30 minute safety presentation on the dangers of grilled cheese sandwiches. It contained literally nothing about fire safety. It was all choking hazards and cholesterol. Our RA was furious, but the student pointed out that the write up that he'd been given just said safety presentation. We didn't get any more presentations after that. 3. If you violated the dress code policy, you had to wear these really big gray sweatpants or sweatshirts that said DCV in big orange letters. Dress code violation. It became A thing to get caught because they were apparently really comfortable. When the admin finally caught on that people were trying to get them on purpose, they changed it so that you got in school suspension. Jokes on them for that too. Lots of kids preferred that over being in class 4. If you return a library book late, your parents would have to return it and explain why it's late. It worked about as well as you would think. The rule lasted a few months before they figured it wasn't worth the cost of replacing all the books. Kid I can't return this book. Parent why not? Kid it's late. Parent so? Kid school says you have to do it and tell them why I didn't return it on time. Parent oh well, I guess they aren't getting it back, are they? 5. It wasn't a school wide policy, but I had a super bitchy French teacher who would constantly hand out detentions for things as inconsequential as walking to the trash can to throw away a piece of paper. She absolutely could not deal with the fact that we periodically might need to actually leave our chairs for a perfectly valid reason. One day she locked herself out of the classroom and nobody would let her back in. Sorry, we aren't allowed to get out of our seats. She had to get the janitor. Six when I was in kindergarten during the morning announcements. One day they came On and said, and please no throwing snowballs, there is a chance you might accidentally get some rocks in them. You could see on the faces of all 20 some students the realization that, OMG, we could put rocks in them.

When my little sister Lena got diagnosed with Ms, she didn't cry. She just looked at me and said, I guess I won't beat you in races anymore. She said it with a smile. Can you imagine a 12 year old girl knowing her body is betraying her and still trying to make me feel better? So naturally I became her personal security guard, walking her to school, carrying her books, telling her dumb jokes to make her laugh on hard days. But I wasn't ready for Jason. Jason was the kind of teenage parasite that grows in a locker room and feeds off axe body spray and misplaced confidence. Captain of the basketball team, hair like a shampoo commercial, rain like overcooked broccoli. I was walking Lena to class one day when she dropped her books. Her hands were shaking. Ms does that. Before I could help, Jason and his buddies walked by laughing. He pulled out his phone and said loud enough for everyone to hear, dude, is she glitching? Someone reboot her. I froze. Lena turned bright red and then Jason topped it off by uploading it to his story with the caption error 4:04, dignity not found. The school took it down too late. The damage was done. Lena didn't talk for 3 days. I didn't sleep for 7. See there this thing people don't understand about revenge. It's not about Anger. It's about patience. And I've got the patience of a monk who's just been ghosted. Step 1, confusion. I got access to Jason's locker. Don't ask how. Let, let's just say the janitor smokes menthols and owes me a favor. Every couple of days. I moved things around, switched his notebooks, swapped one shoe for a size smaller, took out his lunch and replaced it with tuna that had been sitting in my garage for a week. He thought he had early onset dementia. I just smiled when he walked by muttering, I swear I packed my red folder. Step 2, sabotage. Jason took ADH meds. Nothing crazy, just enough to keep him focused. I swapped them with over the counter melatonin. Suddenly he was nodding off in history like a narcotic cat that teachers noticed. They didn't think drugs. They thought he was lazy. His grades dropped. College scouts stopped calling. Shame. Step 3, psychological erosion. Jason lived with his grandma because both his parents peaced out when he was in middle school. She was sweet, the kind of grandma who knits ugly sweaters and gives you those hard candies no one actually buys. I ran into her at the pharmacy, helped her carry her bags, complimented her ugly sweater. She called me a nice young man. I called her Nana. Boom, Instant trust. Then I planted the seed. Jason's been acting a little off lately, huh? Talking to himself a lot. She nodded slowly and said, I've Noticed that, too. She took him to a doctor. The DOC upped his meds. I kept swapping them. The result, he started hearing things, whispering, humming. At one point, he said the school lockers were laughing at him. He punched one, broke his wrist, cried in the nurse's office. Step 4, identity removal. I hacked into a student portal, changed small things, wrong birthday, switched his emergency contact from his grandma to a number I bought at a gas station. Then I forged a school psych report stating Jason might be suffering from dissociation. Next thing you know, Jason gets pulled from class and is forced into a mental health evaluation. He passed barely, but now every teacher looked at him like he was a ticking time bomb. In the final nail, I broke into his room while he was out, moved furniture around, rotated his posters, replaced a photo of him and his grandma with a nearly identical one, but with slightly different outfits. It drove him insane. He screamed at her one night that she was in on it. She cried. He got sent to a psych ward for evaluation. He didn't come back. A week later, his grandma bumped into me outside a grocery store, said Jason wasn't himself anymore. I said, maybe he never was. She just nodded, sighed, and handed me a bag of those disgusting candies. Oh, and Lena, she started smiling again, drawing again, talking again. As for Jason, he went from being The king of the school to being a ghost in a hospital gown who doesn't know if the voices in his head are real. And the best part, he still doesn't know who did it. He just knows someone did that. Paranoia, it'll live rent free in his head until the day he dies. And me, I sleep just fine. After all, some glitches can't be fixed.

It destroyed the grass and ruined the soil under it. The grass and soil on a football field are specific and expensive. It cost tens of thousands of dollars to repair it on such short notice. The school wanted to be lenient. However, the insurance company required them to get the police involved to cover the claim. So they were arrested. 8.

Second time we all stuck around in the school parking lot to witness the aftermath. His dad was apocalyptic. You hit the same pole. How? How? He got a used banana yellow wagon after that. It was hilarious. 9. Messed around with a German foreign exchange student on the principal's desk during a Pep rally. Instant expulsion. Exchange student was sent back to Germany. In his defense, it was consensual and she was devastatingly attractive.

We all stuck around in the school parking lot to witness the aftermath. His dad was apocalyptic. You hit the same pole? How? How? He got a used banana yellow wagon after that. It was hilarious. 9.

Naomi completely crashed out in the best way, in the most supportive way possible for this AJ Lee return. And I'm living for every X post.

Listen, I feel like we all have been waiting for this return, so I feel your pain. These posts are just so iconic. Those Smackdown newbies don't deserve to share a locker room with AJ. If I was there, would have thrown them half his bags in the hallway. Like the praise she's giving her. It's so amazing. I'm absolutely loving it. And then someone writes back, so what are you doing at home then? Old B punching the air like she is. She's so amazing. I love you, Naomi. She did warn us the other day and let us know that if AJ Lee did return on Smackdown, that we would all witness the biggest crash out of the century on this app. And that's exactly what's happening.

Kristen Kabbot, the woman who was spotted on the Jumbotron in Boston at a Coldplay concert. She was seen with her CEO boyfriend at the time who was not her husband. And the two of them have since had to leave their company. The Daily Mail is now reported that on August 13th, she filed paperwork in the courts in Portsmouth, New Hampshire to officially divorce her husband, Andrew Cabot. The outlet claims to have spoken to his second wife, her name is Julia, who says that she texted Andrew shortly after seeing the kiss cam video and his response to her questions was, her life has nothing to do with me now. She also added that she doesn't think his feelings were hurt by this. He might have been embarrassed, but she says that he's, quote, not a nice guy and all he cares about is money. Neither of them have spoken out about the situation, but their former company, astronomer, certainly did. They issued a statement saying they do not stand behind this behavior and both of them soon step down from the company. It appears that they definitely got caught cheating and the two of them may now be single.

One. They are really calm during a crisis, but not necessarily when the crisis is passed. Two. They don't ask for help because people have let them down a lot. Three. Exceptional situational awareness. They know where people around them are and generally everything happening around them. 4. Memory problems. 5. They appear distant or emotionally reserved, especially when it comes to personal topics, and struggle with opening up or letting people in. 6. When closing a door, they turn the door knob, push the door in, then release the knob so that it closes as quietly as possible. Seven. They don't know how to accept kindness or are suspicious of it. 8. Chill to the point of detachment. They've stopped caring about most things because caring too much used to hurt. 9. They sit and watch in social settings, very observant. 10. They are funny. 11. There's nothing you can say that will surprise them. They know how messed up the world is. They know what people can do, even the good ones. 12. Not only do they not ask for help, they don't like to burden others with whatever is going on. 13. They apologize for everything. 14. Children get a hardened look in their eyes and they look like adults in children's bodies, and it's honestly pretty unsettling once you've seen it. 15. They overdo everything and are mostly givers.

One of the richest men in the world who has an unnatural amount of influence over the US president does a salute tied to a dangerous movement bad. I naturally feel bad about it. 4. It looked like something he could no longer keep inside. 5. I'd need Shorsie's vocabulary to properly express that. 6. My true feelings about this would get me banned from this website. All I will say is that it is wildly unacceptable and any competent administration would have been ejected from his position before the end of the day. If a member of Biden's administration did this in 2020, the outrage from the right would be off the charts. 7. Just a reminder that I believe his grandparents were associated with the same radical ideologies. And that his dad gave him a name from a SCI fi book written by someone with similar values. Werner von Braun. 8. They've won. They don't have to hide. I have friends and family members laughing it off saying it's a joke or that he is weird, and it's him saying his heart goes out to those who support him. I'm not kidding. We're cooked. Nine if you're surprised, you haven't been paying attention. 10. Texted my dad the Video of him doing the salute, him being a Trump supporter, had the following explanations. There was nothing bad about his salute. He did it. But he was showing where we were versus where we are going. It was actually hail to the chief. That's a song. Oh, yeah. But Joe Biden is a commie. I have never been so disappointed in my own father.

I clarified that I had to leave in 1 hour and 30 minutes and he said that's actually 1.3 hours. 3. What kind of bird is a ham? Was hard to ignore. 4, when he ran out of gas while in line at the Starbucks drive through right across the street from the gas station. I told him to get gas first because his car was low, but he really needed that iced caramel macchiato. I asked why he didn't listen to me and he replied with, I thought I could make it. He ended up pushing the car through the drive through and got his coffee while doing so. Then park the car in the lot and call the tow to tow it back home instead of the gas station across the street. No, he did not get any gas that day. He waited until his dad got off work to bring a 3 gallon jug of gasoline because I refused to enable that crap. 5. How do oil companies know where to build gas stations? She thought that there was a gasoline bubble underground that they would tap into and run a line straight to The pump. She was working for Chevron. 6. I was having bad cramps and I took an Advil. My ex told me I shouldn't take them because it's a gazebo. 7, she seemed to be confused about the difference between flamingos and penguins, but insisted they weren't real because she'd grown up in Alaska and never seen any. 8. She had a new telescope and thought it would be really cute to check out the stars after a date one night. I don't remember the full conversation, but at some point I joked about us being stuck together on this giant ball in space. She looked through the telescope again and said, so you believe that, huh? I just stared at her blankly because I was afraid of that question going any further. Anyways, happy to share that we didn't last long. But did you guys know that there's totally like a lot of evidence that our planet is probably not round 9. Wait, the Romans are from Rome. 10. I was going into anaphylactic shock at a restaurant due to unknown allergy. My throat was closing and I had no neck due to swelling. He asked if I wanted to go outside to get some air. We were sitting on the patio.

One. Rebel Wilson. She was funny in the beginning, but rode the fat funny friend trope way too far in every movie. It's so sad. Same with Melissa McCarthy. But at least I feel like Melissa can truly act. She's just stuck in the trope. They both tend to play similar fat slob characters repeatedly. Two. Chris Pratt. Hear me out. He did amazing work on TV. Andy from parks and recreation is an amazing character, and he was great in that role, but since becoming a leading man, he's become wooden. It's like he has this idea of what a leading man should be, and that's all he does in every film. Three. Everybody loves Danny Trejo, but he only ever plays Danny Trejo. To be fair, nobody but Danny Trejo could ever play Danny Trejo. 4. You know that movie where Michael Cera plays the awkward teenager? Yeah, that's basically every movie he's in. Five. Might get some hate for this, but Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart in every movie. He's hilarious and works well in the roles he's in, and I have nothing against the guy, but I don't think his acting has much range. 6. Jared Leto, Will Smith's kids, and many others come to mind, but they often get into acting through nepotism. Many of them come from rich families that helped open doors for them in Hollywood.

One. Silly bands. I worked in retail at the time. After they initially sold out, by the time we got new stock in, nobody wanted them anymore. They all got cleared out. Probably because schools banned them almost immediately. 2. The sea shanty craze. Remember that one random week when everyone was suddenly into sea shanties for some reason? Three Segways does the existence of the Segway count as a trend? It was hyped as the future of transportation, but it never really caught on. 4. The 3D craze. Around 2010 everyone thought 3D was the future. After Avatar came out, every movie tried to be 3d. Then came 3d TVs, 3d phones, and a Nintendo 3ds. The craze died out in about a year, likely because it gave people headaches and was more of a gimmick than an improvement. 5. The summer of Pokemon Go the summer of Pokemon Go was incredible. People were up and outside walking around, getting exercise, strangers met and chatted, and for a brief moment it was cool to be social. Then, if I remember correctly, an app update broke the game and its popularity dropped off drastically. Ironically, about four years later, COVID 19 happened and we were all stuck indoors. A complete opposite of that one wonderful summer of Pokemon Go.

One when my ex and I got into dumb arguments or debates, we'd send it to council for review. There was no council. There would be no review. It was our way of shelving an argument that would never have a winner. Occasionally, we'd ask each other if we heard back from council about the judgment. Two. My husband and I have a game we call business, business. The goal is to clasp the other person's right hand, fully shake it twice, and say business, business. If the other person pulls their hand away or shouts business, business at the same time, it's a failed attempt. There's no score, but the last successful handshake holder is the reigning champion until dethroned. This started as an inside joke, but has spiraled into a full on competition, including notable wins, like at my uncle's funeral while reaching for a water bottle in the middle of the desert, and during heated arguments. Now whenever we try to hold hands, there's always a moment of hesitation to ensure it's not a ploy. 3. When the laundry comes out of the dryer, my partner dumps the warm pile on me, and I sort socks and underwear from inside the heap. Meanwhile, he hangs up shirts and folds pants. We call it Laundry Turtle. 4. He absolutely must touch my butt at least once every time we go to Walmart. I can't even remember how This started, but it feels weird if we forget. 5. We have a dollar Bill that fell between the washer and dryer during laundry one day. Neither of us could be bothered to fish it out, so we left it there for over a year. Eventually we acknowledged it and decided to leave it as a symbol of our wealth. We've added a quarter to it now it's our emergency fund. 6. We wrestle for fun. Not in a sexy or playful let the other one way, but as a legit competition. 7. We often stand in each other's way for no reason other than to be annoying. 8. We have a mating dance that has evolved over the decade we've been together. It includes moves like slapping one's own butt, moving arms like a Choo Choo train, and one handed clapping. Some moves go out of fashion year by year, but our repertoire is significant.

Apparently it's rude. I don't know. 9. I don't know how true it is, but when I was in a hostel in Japan, we met a guy from France, I think. But anywho, at some point he mentioned he could tell we were from USA. He said it was because we talked loudly, like our normal speaking volume was Louder.

When you're in an argument and the person you are arguing with thinks they are winning because they keep interrupting you and won't let you talk, drives me up a wall. 2, having pride in not knowing something. 3, using buzz words without knowing what they mean, especially when you ask them to clarify what they are talking about and they continue regurgitating the same buzzwords. 4, thinking that getting a pay raise means you'll make less money because you are in a higher tax bracket. 5, reading a headline and thinking you now know the whole story. 6. I will never understand flat earthers. You can literally see the curvature of earth depending on where you are. 7. Treating people who speak with an accent like they are ignorant or inferior. These people are literally communicating to you in a second language to them. 8. Bragging about not reading. 9, taking social media influencers seriously. 10, not wanting your kids to do better than you. 11, being really loud for no reason. 12, having no basic geography knowledge. 13, defending billionaires, thinking you'll be one someday while working for the man. 14, people who lack critical thinking skills and the ability to work independently.

You're fired. I left quietly without making a scene, then told my husband to just smiled. Four hours later, panic broke out, 98 missed calls. I've been the head chef at Romano's for three years. When I started, it was a struggling family restaurant with two star reviews and empty tables. I transformed everything, rebuilt the menu, trained the staff, forced local ingredients. Within a year, we were booked solid with a waiting list. But when old Mister Romano died last spring, everything changed. His son Giovanni inherited the place and he had different ideas. Cut costs, use frozen ingredients, fire half the kitchen staff. People can't tell the difference anyway, he'd say, counting receipts. While I fought to maintain the standards that built our reputation, I refused to compromise our lamb. Also buco was legendary. Our house made pasta brought people from three states over. I wasn't about to ruin that for Giovanni's profit margins. So on my 32nd birthday, after our biggest week ever, he called me into the cramped office above the dining room. Birthday balloons from the staff still hung in the kitchen below. Here's my surprise for you, he said with this smug grin. You're fired effective immediately. You're too difficult to work with. I stood there, soft stained apron still tied around my waist, watching him lean back in his father's old chair like he just solved World hunger. I didn't argue, didn't cry, just untied my apron, set it on his desk and walked out past the confused prep cooks who'd worked under me for years. The drive home felt endless. Three years of my life gone. My reputation, my team, my recipes all handed over to someone who thought ketchup was a vegetable. My husband, Scott was waiting in our kitchen with a bottle of wine and that knowing smile he gets when he's up to something. How did the birth a shift go, he asked. Already pouring two glasses. Terrible. Giovanni fired me. His grin widened. Perfect timing. What do you mean perfect timing? I just lost my job. We have a mortgage, Scott bills. He pulled out his laptop, fingers dancing across the key board. Remember that food critic from the times who came in last month, Julia Chen, the one who wrote that amazing review about your lamb dish? Yeah, of course. She said it was transcendent. Why? Well, Scott said, turning the screen toward me, she's been discreetly asking around town about hiring a private chef for her daughter's wedding next weekend. Very exclusive, very high paying. I may have already told her you'd be available. I stared at the email thread. Julia had been trying to reach me for weeks, but Giovanni never passed along messages. She was offering $15,000 for a single event, more than I made in three months at Romano's. Scott, how did you, my phone buzz Text message, then another. Then it started ringing. Giovanni's number flashed on the screen. I let it go to voicemail. Then more calls. The assistant manager, the sous chef, even the dishwasher. By the time I checked, there were 47 missed calls. And count, Scott was refreshing his laptop cackling. Oh, this is beautiful. Look, a skating review had just gone live on every major food blog and review site, posted an hour ago, right around when Giovanni would have been running dinner service without me. Romano's Restaurant, a spectacular fall from Grace, read the headline. The review was brutal. Food quality has completely collapsed, undercooked chicken, rude service. Avoid at all costs.

In my family, skinny daughters were worthless, and fat daughters were currency. The heavier you were, the higher your bride price. Every girl at 13 got sent to the fattening house for a minimum of two years. Where gaining weight wasn't a suggestion, it was survival. I grew up watching my older cousins disappear into that house walking on their own two feet and wheeled out in chairs too heavy to stand. My cousin Amara went in at 115 pounds and came out at 340. She was married within a week to a man who paid extra for her stretch marks. They called them beauty lines. But I saw how she gasped for air walking to her own wedding. The process was simple. Six meals a day, each one monitored by the house mothers. You sat in a circle while they ladled bowls of crushed millet mixed with butter, sugar and milk down your throat. If you threw up, they'd make you eat the vomit. Waste nothing, gain everything, my aunt would say cheerfully, while girls cried into their bowls. 4,000 calories per meal, minimum. They had tricks to make you hungrier. Salt baths that made you retain water, medications that increased appetite. Exercise was forbidden, except for throat stretches to help you swallow faster. My sister Kayla tried doing squats in secret. They caught her and force fed her until her stomach. Nearly as punishment, she had to eat standing up for a month. I was 11 when I found the death book hidden in my grandmother's closet while looking for Eid money. Names and weights filled three notebooks. Amara, age 22, heart failure, 389 pounds. Fatu, age 19, diabetes coma, 412 pounds. Mariama, age 24, stroke, 445 pounds. Page after page of girls who never made it to third. The weights next to their names weren't just numbers. They were their sale prices. But what really made me sick was the profit column. Beside each death, my grandmother had calculated how much money the family made from their bride price minus funeral costs. Tattoo's death netted the family $85,000. Her husband kept the dowry even though she only lived four months after the wedding. That's when I started planning. I was smart about it. Told everyone I was starting a traditional cooking circle for younger girls to prepare them for the fattening house. We met every Thursday in my uncle's garage teaching recipes. But what I really taught was chemistry. The exact amount of salt to retain 20 pounds of water weight for weigh ins. How to make fake fat suits from layered fabric and memory foam. Ways to trigger temporary bloating that would disappear after measurements. We got creative as hell. Practice eating competitions where girls Learned to hide food in their cheeks and spit it out. Later developed a system of herbal teas that lost appetite while making your face look puffy. Made our own weight gain shakes that were actually Just protein powder and laxatives. The house mothers thought we were so dedicated. My genius move was suggesting we document our journey for marriage advertisements. We took photos, but Learned exactly which angles and clothing made you look 50 pounds heavier. Bought a broken scale that added 80 pounds and swapped it during official weigh ins. By the time I turned 13 and entered the house myself, I had a network of 15 girls, all trained in the art of fake fattening. We shared clothes that had hidden weights sewn into the hems. Learned to walk slow and breathe heavy like we were carrying extra weight. Perfected the arm positions that made our pictures look massive. The house mothers praised us constantly. Look how well Alia gains, they'd say, as I stepped on the rigged scale. We became their star students while secretly flushing thousands of calories down the toilet every night. Some girls Learned to throw up silently. Others developed jaw techniques that made swallowing look real.

It's not like he was your wife or anything. And without skipping a beat, the man replied, I know I shouldn't be so upset, but man, he just gave really good prostate exams. The entire table started cracking up. I nearly spit my drink out from laughing so hard. And the man pointed at me and said, see, he gets it. 7, I was walking along 10th Street in Brooklyn when a man walked by on his phone and all I caught of his conversation was, I don't know, I've never owned a effing giraffe before.

Steven Seagal. 2. Any of the Kardashians. I stopped watching American Horror Stories cause Kim is in them now. 3. James Corden. He's even terrible in his own show. 4, Kevin Hart. His talent is being Kevin Hart in movies that don't need him to be. Five, when I was younger, I really didn't like Shelly Duvall. Her whiny, yelling and tear ridden performance in The Shining and her being olive oil. I thought she was the worst. As an adult, I was able to see that she was just a great actress that performed both of those roles to absolute perfection. Like Joffrey in game of Thrones. Their performance was entirely convincing and gave you a visceral reaction to the character. 6, Jada Pinkett. 7, I am begging Hollywood to stop putting Jared Leto in things. 8, Cara Delevingne, Total Talent Vacuum. 9, Nick Cannon. Jesus almost ruined B99. 10, Lena Dunham. Oh my god, insufferable. 11, Dwayne Johnson. You just know the movie won't have any substance. 12, Dakota Johnson. If I hear she's in something, I won't watch. 13, Jennifer Lopez. 14. I have nothing against Chris Pratt, but I'd like it if he wasn't in everything ever anymore. 15. This may be a hot take, but Blake Lively.

In my first apartment, my parents came to visit and I said freak when I hit my head on the open door of the freezer while standing up from grabbing something from the fridge. My mother said, you can't talk like that in my home and stopped mid sentence. I pointed at her and said, yeah, that's right, mom, shut your mouth. 2. I taught my 6th grade students about democratic processes and we ran a simulation without fail. Every one of my classes tried to impeach me. 3, a coworker friend of mine was flying back from a sales conference in Vegas and he was able to upgrade to a first class seat. We had this obnoxious sales VP that was on the same flight. She was the snobby entitled type with a full time nanny and giant Mcmansion in the suburbs and she generally treated people who worked for her like servants. She sees him in a first class seat as she is making her way to coach and asks him how he got that seat. As people are getting settled in, she makes her way back up to the first class cabin and asks to speak with a lead flight attendant. She tells him that one of her underlings is sitting in first class and that she needs to switch with him since she's higher on the corporate ladder. The guy can't Believe what he's hearing, but she won't take no for an answer. Finally, he tells her she has to go back to her seat or she will be escorted from the plane. She made a complete joke of herself in front of the whole first class cabin 4. When I was in high school, I worked at a popular warehouse club selling computers on weekends. I was hired by the store manager through a friend's referral. I loved computers, so my job was to stay in the computer department and sell them, nothing else. One shift manager didn't like that and insisted I needed to go fold clothes for half my shift. I told him the store manager instructed me never to leave the technology department, but he insisted. This went on for several weeks. The store manager showed up one weekend when we were both working. He slapped a stack of green bar paper, this was a while ago, onto a shelf and pointed to some highlighted numbers. He looked at the shift manager and said, do you see this? This is our average tech sales when you're on shift. See this number over here? This is our average tech sales when you're not. At this point, it would be more cost effective to simply fire you. What do you think? The guy stammered like a toddler caught bullying another kid. Fortunately, he wasn't fired, but the store manager made it clear that when I was on shift, I Was not to leave the tech department unless I was on break or there was a fire. That shift manager never said another word to me.

One, in high school, I woke up on a day where very icy weather was expected and couldn't find school closings on TV. I begrudgingly got ready for school, stepped out my front door and immediately slipped on ice, landing flat on my back. Got up, shook it off and cursed the school for not being closed. I had to crawl my way up a hill to the bus stop because I kept slipping down ice on the way there. Got to the bus stop and waited over half an hour for it to get there. Check my watch repeatedly, getting more and more angry each time. Finally decide that they must have canceled school and slowly make it back home where I see a clock. It was now 2:00am. 2. I once was cooking Mac and cheese and started squeezing the cheese sauce in before draining the water. When I realized the mistake, I grabbed the cheese sauce with my hands and it just made everything worse in every way. 3, birthday is March 12th. In high school, I saw that my birthday was going to fall on a Thursday, so I was like, oh wow, Thursday the 12th. I proceeded to scan the next couple of decades on my iPod touch calendar to find out if my birthday would ever fall on Friday the 13th. 4. I recently went to pick up an order of glasses. The optician asked me To try them on to see if they fit well. I told him this must be someone else's order because everything was blurry. He was surprised and started hunting through boxes and I kept squinting and looking around at blurry shapes. We did this for 10 minutes before the optometrist walked in. He explained the issue and the optometrist paused and asked where I put the glasses I was wearing when I walked in. I said I was wearing contacts. I was wearing contacts and I put the new glasses over my contacts. I asked the optometrist if this gave me double the perfect vision and she replied, if you mean double vision, sure. 5. During the holidays, I walked through an arts and crafts store trying to find something very specific. After finding out they didn't have it, I got in a long line to check out. It didn't hit me that I didn't have anything to buy until it was my turn. I just walked past the cashier, waved and said, have a nice day. It was night f my life. 6, wondering if lime was real word or if I made it up.

When I ordered a small drink, it was actually small. 2. The only thing that really surprised me was how much pedestrians trusted cars to not hit them. 3. The age of all the buildings. Walked into a pub in the UK with a plaque that reads something like, this building was constructed in the year 2 and was used by monks to fend off dinosaurs. Maybe not the exact words, but you get it. 4. I went to Scotland, ran across some German tourists who asked us to translate what the Scott was saying. We were all three speaking English. They just couldn't understand each other. 5. You hear about how big the Roman Empire was and all the advanced building tech they had, but it doesn't really sink in until you see it with your own eyes. 6. In France, people get two hour lunches. Like some stores will have two separate open and close times cause they'll just shut down for two hours a day to enjoy themselves. Most people seemed much happier and relaxed as a whole. 7. That tax was included on the price tag. 8. I'm Dutch, but I'll never forget my American girlfriend's reaction to seeing rows and rows of parked bicycles in front of the train station when she came to visit the Netherlands. Oh my god, look at all those bikes. 9 in Italy, the shower at one of My hotels had no barriers to keep the water in one general area. It was just a drain in the floor. Luckily, it was just that one, and it was definitely an older hotel. 10, the amount of public transportation, and in many places, people not driving or not even knowing how to drive. Even young children were using public transportation, not escorted by adults to get to school. Eleven, I heard a story of a lady who was dumbfounded that there weren't going to be fireworks celebrating the 4th of July. Couldn't conceive the idea that other countries don't celebrate America's Independence Day. 12, I was in Switzerland for a few days. I felt like the fattest person in the country at 6 feet, 210 pounds. 13. Personal bubble is very different. It shocks you at first and you feel sort of claustrophobic, but then you get used to it. Two, it's kind of subtle until you come back to the States and unconsciously stand so close to someone else in a line that they start shooting you dirty looks.

I heard someone say, if you wonder why an actress stopped working, the answer is probably Harvey Weinstein. It's really sad. I see Sopranos fans asking why the actress who played Gloria Trillo didn't do much else. The big answer is that Harvey Weinstein blocked her career from advancing because she turned down his advances. 2, Kevin Spacey. You never see him in anything anymore. I really loved him in house of cards and American Beauty. 3, Taylor Lautner was huge during the Twilight era. He had fans screaming over Team Jacob and seemed set for a major career after that. But when Twilight ended, he started appearing in fewer projects and it's like he faded out as quickly as he shot to fame. Now you barely hear anything about him. And it's wild considering how massive he was for those few years. 4, L m. F. A released party rock anthem, then sorry for party rocking and then vanished off the face of the earth. 5. If you had told me 20 years ago that the most relevant Olsen sister would be Elizabeth, I'd have been very confused. But here we are. The other two are an unentity and she's part of the biggest film franchise of our generation. 6, Wiz Khalifa. I never really listened to him, but black and yellow was on a loop all through high school. After I graduated, I never heard anything about him again. 7, Ellen Degeneres was known for her be kind brand, but then stories emerged about toxic work environments and how poorly people were treated on her show. Former employees and even celebrity guests spoke out. While her show continued for a bit, her reputation was severely damaged. It's crazy how she went from America's beloved talk show host to someone people view as hypocritical. Eight, Chrissy Teigen was known as the Queen of Twitter and was beloved for her witty social media presence. But then past tweets and messages resurfaced showing her bullying behavior and she faced massive backlash. Brands dropped her and she took a long break from social media. Her reputation hasn't fully bounced back and it's wild how fast things turned for her. 9, Louis CK. Was one of the biggest comedians around until allegations of inappropriate behavior came out. He admitted to it, but his career took a major hit with networks and streaming services dropping his shows and projects. He's tried to make a comeback, but it's clear he'll never have the same mainstream acceptance he once did.

We didn't make letter openers in shop class. After that. 4, thought he was funny and decided to grab the SRO, student resource officer's gun. Our SRO also happened to be part of SWAT. He did this as we all left end of day crowded hall. I remember this vividly over 20 years later. This was also post Columbine by like a month. Kid got slammed into a wall, put in cuffs, arrested and expelled immediately. 5, peeing on a teacher who wouldn't let him go to the bathroom. 6, tackled and restrained by coaches after he grabbed a bat from the storage room with the intention of beating his pregnant math teacher with it. 7, downloading corn on the school computers was the last straw. He even used his own login. 8. He kicked my friend in the ass so hard it broke his tailbone. He literally broke my friend's ass. 9, running through the cafeteria at lunch naked with a backpack on that he set on fire. 10 for spraying the fire extinguisher in the principal's Face after he called him short. 11, stabbed a kid for mocking his dead sister. Hey, how's your sister? Why don't you ask her? Stabs.

If you're passionate about what you do, you won't work a day in your life. Wrong. It's still really hard work even though you enjoy it. And to make matters worse, you might work so hard to the point where you end up hating the thing you love. 2. Tilt your head back during a bloody nose. You don't want to flood your throat with nose blood. 3. You should spend two months wages on an engagement ring as a marketing slogan. 4. That people are good eye witnesses. We aren't. Our perception of things sucks. We are prone to so many biases that we aren't even aware of. If I grade papers on an empty stomach, I will grade them lower than if I am not hungry, and I will never admit that to be true even though it is. Five. In medical school we're taught that common things are common, and that when you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras, meaning that we should always assume the most obvious diagnosis. Medical students almost always jump to the rarest disease when taking multiple choice tests or when they first go out into clinical rotations and see real patients. 6. You don't need to wait 30 minutes before going swimming after eating. This was just invented by public pools to stop people bringing food into the water. 7. Put ice on a burn. Do not do this, it can rip the skin. Do Put the burn under cool water immediately. 8. You hold your breath if you run out of air while scuba diving. Wrong. Your lungs will explode as you'll float upwards with a lung full of air, and you probably will try to surface anyway and the air inside them expands. The proper procedure is to scream all the way up to make sure your airways are open. 9. Don't trust someone who won't look you in the eyes. Having social anxiety doesn't make you a bad person, and sociopaths have no problem staring you down.

Not because it was a quirky fashion choice, but because he genuinely didn't notice. I pointed it out and he got so flustered, mumbling something about laundry. Then he looked at me totally serious and said, are you gonna cancel the date now? Like a nervous middle schooler, I fell for him right there, socks and all. Two, we were at the arcade and he got way too invested in the claw machine, not for himself, but because he saw a stuffed turtle. He said, look like me when I'm cranky. It took him six tries, 20 bucks and some serious trash talk to the machine, but he got it when he handed it to me, he said, now you can hold me when I'm not around. That turtle's still on my bed. 3, he doesn't know how to cook at all. But one night I was sick and he showed up with instant noodles, gummy bears and a handwritten get well card drawn in blue pen. He spelled fever wrong, but he also drew me as a superhero, complete with a cape and a little speech bubble that said, I got this. I swear I got better instantly. He made me a playlist titled Songs That Remind Me of You and forgot to check the shuffle setting. First song was Shrek 2 soundtrack. I asked if it was A joke. He panicked and said, no, it's romantic. He really loved her. 5. He tied my shoelace because it came undone and said, safety first, princess, like he was a knight or something. I giggled and he turned red. 6. I caught him flexing in the mirror when he thought I wasn't looking. He whispered, she likes strong arms to himself. I had to pretend I didn't hear so he wouldn't die of embarrassment. 7. We walked past a Lego store and he stopped mid sentence, gasped and said, can we please go in just for a minute? Thirty minutes later, he was building a tiny pirate ship and explaining the lore of each mini figure. Eight, he named a raccoon that lives near his apartment. Captain bites and leaves snacks for it every time it shows up. He waves like it's a neighbor. First time I saw it, he said, look, he came to meet you. 9. He once got mad at a seagull because it looked at me wrong. Said, what's it got to squawk about, huh? And puffed his chest like he was ready to square up. 10, he lost a round of UNO and threw a mini tantrum, arms crossed, pouty lip, the whole thing. Then he looked up at me totally serious and said, you're lucky I love you or this would be war.

My husband's friend Kate always had to be the main character in every situation. When someone else had good news, Kate suddenly had better news. At group dinners, she'd hijack any conversation within five minutes. I couldn't stand her, but I put up with it because she and Zach had been friends since college. After my husband and I announced our pregnancy at 12 weeks, things with Kate got really weird. Suddenly, Kate was everywhere we went sporting a small baby bump. She showed up at our favorite brunch spot rubbing her belly. She enrolled in our exact prenatal yoga class. She even switched to our OB practice. Nobody questioned it because these things happen and women get pregnant. At the same time, she posted weekly bump photos on Instagram and everyone congratulated her just like they did me. Three months in, one of our friends mentioned something strange at a girls night. She said Kate's belly looked bigger the previous Tuesday at Book Club than it did at Saturday's barbecue. When she brought it up, Kate burst into tears about how cruel it was to comment on a pregnant woman's body. She went on about water retention and bloating and how pregnant women deal with enough judgment without their friends piling on. Our friend felt terrible and apologized profuse while the rest of us comforted Kate. After that night, nobody dared mention anything about her appearance again, even though I started Noticing her bump size seemed to fluctuate, too. That's when things got uncomfortable. Kate started making comments about how wild it was that we got pregnant around the same time. She'd joke about our babies being best friends, maybe even more than friends someday. Then the jokes got stranger, like when she said pregnancy brain made her forget exactly when she conceived. And wasn't it funny how close our due dates were? She started showing up at every single appointment Zach and I had, always in the waiting room when we arrived. Claiming her appointment was right before or after hours during our maternity photo shoot at the park, she appeared with her own photographer, saying what a coincidence that she booked the same spot. The photographer later told me Kate had called asking what time we'd be there. Everything exploded at my baby shower. My sister threw this beautiful garden party with all our family and friends there to celebrate. Halfway through opening gifts, Kate stood up and clinked her glass to make an announcement. With tears streaming down her face, she placed her hand on her belly and said, I have the most wonderful news to share with everyone. Zack and I are having a baby together. The entire party gasped and she continued with a huge smile. I know this is unconventional, but isn't it beautiful that our babies will be siblings?

One. All I can say is that most women are far more attractive than they give themselves credit for. Two my wife is at her most attractive to me when she is laughing or enjoying herself. When she laughs and genuinely smiles, my heart swells. That is the whole reason I act like a goofball all the damn time. I just want to see her smile and laugh as much as possible. Three being without makeup. The other day I came home and my wife was wearing a sundress and no makeup and it was the most beautiful I can ever remember having seen her. She apologized for not having any makeup on. Four laugh lines are more attractive than Botox face. 5. Mom bod. I work with fashion models for a living. Some people can't fathom that I'm infinitely more attracted to a 40+ year old woman with a big old butt, a belly, and wrinkles around her eyes than I am to a skinny 20 year old with ABS and perfect skin. I'm 49. I like women roughly my own age with a body that makes sense for that age. Why is that so hard to believe? 6. That little fluff where the hip meets the thigh that flares out when they sit down. It's one of my favorite parts. Seven what I don't understand is when women hide or mask their real Laugh. There's nothing more attractive than seeing a beautiful woman completely lose it with laughter. The way she holds her sides, the little snort. It's just too cute. It's sad that some people have made them feel unattractive for expressing themselves. 8. I have yet to see a single person who looked better after doing that buckle fat removal procedure. Chubby cheeks are amazing. Nine. Girls who are insecure about their noses have the best noses. 10. I hang around in groups of guys who are guys. Guys. Not once have I heard a guy complain about cellulite. Like, literally not once. 11. How she looks when she first wakes up. 12 years ago, my husband was hospitalized for abdominal surgery. I dressed up four days in a row to go visit him. On the fifth day, I said, to heck with this and went to the hospital in jeans, chambray shirt, tennis shoes, and a ponytail. When I entered, he said, there you are with a big smile. Nice memory.

Kanye West I don't know, I've just always found him pathetic. His behavior and statements over the years haven't helped his case. 3. Nicki Minaj lately she seems really desperate and it's hard to watch. She's struggling to maintain her relevance in a way that feels forced and uncomfortable. 4. Matthew Perry he was doing relatively fine staying out of the limelight and living as a friend's legend. Then he published that autobiography and included comments like why is it that Keanu Reeves is alive and River Phoenix is dead? Among other off color remarks. Now a lot of people dislike him and his reputation has taken a serious hit. 5. Corey Feldman he's making a strong case for the top spot with his recent wave of band videos flooding social media. The performances are painfully bad and he acts like he's playing to sold out arenas even though the venues look more like the basements of VFW halls. It's beyond cringe worthy. Six. Madonna. The bad plastic surgery and obsession with much younger boyfriends are so beneath her. She's an icon, but she's making a fool of herself unnecessarily. It's sad to see someone with her legacy behaving like this.

I really loved him in house of cards and American Beauty. 3, Taylor Lautner was huge during the Twilight era. He had fans screaming over Team Jacob and seemed set for a major career after that. But when Twilight ended, he started appearing in fewer projects and it's like he faded out as quickly as he shot to fame. Now you barely hear anything about him. And it's wild considering how massive he was for those few years. 4, L m. F. A released party rock anthem, then sorry for party rocking and then vanished off the face of the earth. 5. If you had told me 20 years ago that the most relevant Olsen sister would be Elizabeth, I'd have been very confused. But here we are. The other two are an anity and she's part of the biggest film franchise of our generation. 6, Wiz Khalifa. I never really listened to him, but black and yellow was on a loop all through high school. After I graduated, I never heard anything about him again. 7, Ellen Degeneres was known for her be kind brand, but then stories emerged about toxic work environments and how poorly people were treated on her show. Former employees and even celebrity guests spoke out. While her show continued for a bit, her reputation was severely damaged. It's crazy how she went from America's beloved talk show host to someone people view as hypocritical. Eight, Chrissy Teigen was known as the Queen of Twitter and was beloved for her witty social media presence. But then past tweets and messages resurfaced showing her bullying behavior and she faced massive backlash. Brands dropped her and she took a long break from social media. Her reputation hasn't fully bounced back and it's wild how fast things turned for her. 9, Louis CK. Was one of the biggest comedians around until allegations of inappropriate behavior came out. He admitted to it, but his career took a major hit with networks and streaming services dropping his shows and projects. He's tried to make a comeback, but it's clear he'll never have the same mainstream acceptance he once did.

We survive so well that we can freely complain about survival not being to our liking. 2. The concept of pets. We capture other species not to eat or enslave them, but to be friends with them. 3. We can reflect on the fact that we exist. 4. Sometimes I wonder if other animals think humans are ugly. Like those weird hairless cats. We just have this tuft of hair on top and the rest is naked. While we somehow find each other attractive, I wouldn't be surprised if animals thought look at those weird, almost hairless things walking on two feet. So gross. Five. On Halloween we sometimes dress up like the skeletons inside our own bodies. 6. How easily we lose track of reality. A friend of mine once asked me for the $10 I owed him, only to realize he had dreamt that he'd lend it to me. 7. Humans are insanely tough. A lot of animals go into shock and die from injuries humans routinely bounce back from. Many of the flavors we enjoy come from poisons we're immune to. Humans are better at hot weather and long distance running than any other animal. An ancient hunting method involved jogging after a deer all day until it collapsed from exhaustion. We thrive in a massive range of environments. We handle sleep deprivation better than most animals. Screwed dwarfs. Humans should be the ones with a con. We're the John Mcclane of nature. 8. As individuals, we're unique in our drives, wants and needs. But as a group, we're boring and predictable. 9. The body's ability to heal wounds is fascinatingly overlooked. 10. Humans hold themselves separate from nature. To us, there's nature and then there's humanity. When nature encroaches on humanity, we fight it back. Eleven. We went to the moon not because it was lucrative or to gain something, but purely to say to the other tribe, I'm better than you. 12. We know we are going to die. No other animal carries that weight. 13. Humans can survive a gunshot to the abdomen, but a peanut can kill some of us. 14. We instinctively judge others. It seems to be hardwired into us to stare at someone and form conscious thoughts about them. 15. Our kneecaps are weak as hell. Talk about a design flaw. 16. Imagine life without timekeeping. You probably can't. You know the month, year and day of the week. There's a clock on your wall, dashboard or phone. You live by schedules and calendars. Yet all around us, time keeping is ignored by nature. Birds are not late. Dogs don't check their watches. Deer don't fret over passing birthdays. Man alone measures time. Man alone chimes the hour. And because of this, man alone suffers a paralyzing fear. No other creature endures the fear of time running out.

I once had a pre kindergartener who could read and cried because he was so upset with how dumb the rest of the kids were. 2. I had a student ask for an extension on their paper because they were representing our nation in the World Science Festival. They came in third and the paper was an a plus. 3 had a first grader figure out exponents on his own. 4 kid took the fat highlighters, cut them open and remove the insides and replaced it with weed, sold them at school. He was caught but only because a kid snitched after they were caught getting high. Absolutely brilliant. 5. One of my kindergarteners just knows multiplication and not just the basic fives or tens. In the beginning when his parents told me I played along with 2, 2 or 10 x 10 but you can tell him 17 x 14 and he knows it instantly. So cool to watch. 6. I had a kid who could take one look at a national flag and then point to the corresponding country on an unlabeled world map instantly. I think that kid spent too many hours playing grand strategy games. 7. I'm a piano teacher on the side teaching a 4 year old how to read sheet music before she can read books. I ask her to find the C's and she will point them out. On the page, ECT. She can also do math really well and understands the concept of multiplication. Also another student that just started and plays by ear and composes her own pieces at 8. She also speaks five languages, which I didn't find out until I told her I was learning German. After teaching her for three months, she's already to the point where I had to send her to a better teacher.

Two at the aquarium, she said, wow, daddy, that fish is even uglier than you. 3 Last Thursday, after I had a particularly stressful day at work, my seven year old said, the only job that matters to me is being my dad, and you're awesome at it. And if mommy leaves you for another dad, I will always tell the new dad that my old dad was my favorite dad. Thanks, I love you. Where's your mom? Four me tell me a joke.

Turns back around he was not wrong. 7 I was standing with my two fat friends in grocery store. We are all fat. Kid comes around the corner in cart pushed by mom and exclaims, Mommy, those guys are fat! Mom looks us over and nods in approval. No fucks given. 8 are you having a baby or just fat? I'm male. 9 why do you have little Volcanoes on your face! Fuck you, you little fuck! 10 daddy, why do you have so many wives? My three year old Disney princess movie obsessed daughter said to me I was a single 20 years old dad with full custody. So naturally, she saw me go through a few different girlfriends. That was the moment I decided things were gonna change.

One. She changed her clothes in front of me while casually talking. Two. I was 17 and was best friends with a college girl in town. We were chilling late one night and we wrapped up a movie and was getting her stuff together since she had work in the morning. She stopped me and said, what if I just stay? The way she looked at me when she said that, it sealed my fate forever. I married that woman and we now have two beautiful little kids. Three. She nuzzled into my neck during a hug. We hadn't seen each other in a while, so it was definitely an interesting surprise. 4. I had a personal trainer friend brag about her braided ponytail and then had me give it a sharp tug while we were at work. We both immediately understood that could not happen at work again. Five. Told me he really likes my body, then got flustered trying to rephrase. He meant my tattoos. I had a new one on my arm. I think he blushed a little. Six. I had a really good friend in grad school. We would talk, ride motorcycles, go to local fairs, hang out, and just generally have fun. She was very pretty, but I never thought of her in a romantic way. She was taking belly dancing lessons and decided to give me a quick sample while we were at the Library. I was instantly turned on and couldn't think of her in any other way after that. 7. She was dressed as a police officer for a Halloween party and I jokingly suggested she handcuffed me. Learned new things about myself that night. 8. I was crossing the road with a former classmate in college and as we were about to go, a car sped up suddenly and he put his hand in front of me to protect me from going. I didn't find him attractive or anything, but that was, surprisingly to me, a huge turn on that came out of nowhere. 9. She came over to our friend's house and was wearing a zip up hoodie. She went up to me and gave me a hug, then told me she wasn't wearing anything underneath and unzipped it a little. Ten. She took my hat. I chased and caught her and pinned her up against the wall to get the hat back. When I pinned her hands above her head to get the hat, she bit her lip and she gave me a look. When she gave me that look, I also instantly felt what she was feeling. 11. She fed me popcorn one by one. 12. I knew this girl who was hands down the prettiest I've ever seen. No makeup, with her hair pulled back. She smiled at me while trying my glasses on. I had to turn away due to my body's reaction. We were outside So I was able to act naturally. 13, she was the girl next door. We would chat, but nothing else. Until one day, she kissed me. 48 years later, she's still kissing me.

This started after a cosplay costume arrived for him that was way too small and he put it on to try and tear it like he was the Hulk but couldn't so I helped. We also rescue pigeons. 7. I used to put googly eyes on my then girlfriend while she slept and wait for her to find them the next day and see if I could be so strategic that she'd go the whole day at work and not find some. I succeeded. One night I put a bigger one on her forehead after she dozed off, half used and would come off very easily so the glue and suction wouldn't have left a Mark and went to brush my teeth. Few minutes later she came in, looks in the mirror, stares and very groggy and dryly said, why is there a googly eye on my head? I laughed for a good several minutes straight. 8.

For example, Manny the Manny is always up to Something illegal. 9, we do this thing where I say something and then she tells me I'm wrong.

Sleep. Every morning I asked my wife how she slept and it's the same reply. I didn't sleep at all. Poor girl hasn't slept in 30 years. 2. I used to think girls cried ink. Turns out it was just mascara. Three, wash their bras after every time they wear it. Buy a lot of clothes. In reality, they just walk around in stores, touch clothes and say, oh, this is cute. Brush their hair 100 times a night. 6. As a kid I thought that girls thought that swords, Shields and armor were stupid. Turns out that there are plenty of women who love swords and metal work and stuff like that. 7. I thought women would wear more skirts or high heels than they do in reality, which is 100% understandable. Why not be comfortable or dress however the hell you want? Only I feel like skirts and heels are just a bit overrepresented in media. Just like how you'll see way more men in suits on television or in movies than you generally will on the average street day to day. 8. That every woman liked other women and they were only with a man because, well, I don't know. 9, powder their nose. Turns out it's mostly just in movies. 10. I have been with my wife for 15 years and I have never heard her fart. Not one time. 11, until I Was about 10 ish. I thought all girls were vegetarian and all boys were meat eaters. 12. Growing up, my mother and many of the women in my family were legitimately gold diggers. It took me way too long to realize that not all women base their entire view of men off of their salary. 13. Apparently some women just straight up buy clothes without trying them on first. 14. Due to past experiences, I truly believe that given the opportunity, all women would cheat. Thanks to some amazing daughters in law, I've seen the error of my thinking and realize that I just have terrible taste in women.

One. I had a couple that told me to wait before I pre bus their table so the man could lick every plate clean first. They had multiple apps and entrees between them, and he licked every single one clean before I was allowed to take it. They weren't in a private booth or anything. The other guests could see this happening. 2. I used to work at Olive Garden. There was a lady that would come in at least once a week, and she was dubbed by a staff as Pepperoncini Lady. She would want you to open a new bag of the pepperoncini's we used in the salads and pour out the juice in a cup. She would literally straight up drink the juice. She would also get a bowl of pepperoncini's and just eat them. 3. We had a woman send back a grilled chicken salad because it was cold. So we cooked fresh chicken and made sure to send it out while still warm. She sent it back again. The entire salad wasn't hot enough for her. We microwaved the whole salad. She ate it. 4. Honestly, I'd say the weirdest thing was that while I was a server at a restaurant in the Royal Hawaiian, a guest asked me to book a shark adventure tour. It had nothing to do with my job or even the hotel. Those tours were entirely separate businesses. I took His black card went to guest services, picked up a pamphlet and booked the tour. He tipped me $250. Totally worth it. 5. I used to work at a Japanese restaurant and I once had someone come up to me and asked me if we had any low sodium soy sauce. The request itself was not so strange, and I gave him the bottle we kept behind the counter. The strange thing was what he used the soy sauce for, which was pouring some of it into his Pepsi. 6 once a very thin, middle aged woman came in. She couldn't have weighed more than 100 pounds soaking wet. She asked what our biggest steak was. I told her it was the 24 ounces ribeye. She said, okay, I'll have that. I bring out her steak and she begins eating. She's about a third of the way through when I ask, how is everything? She says, great, bring me another steak. I say, is there anything wrong with that one? She says, no, it's great. I want a second one. I go back to the chef and tell him, and he couldn't believe it. But we served her another steak. She ate all 48 ounces of steak and left me a $40 tip.

On the last day of school, one of the well liked class clown types played a fake seizure prank in a certain teacher's class. He didn't realize she'd had a student literally pass away in her arms the previous year and she had a panic attack thinking it was happening again. The people who knew about her history quickly spread the word and everyone gave him a really hard time for it. He denies it happened to this day, but I was in the room when it happened. I remember being afraid for him, then growing annoyed and silently angry when he started laughing while she began to cry. 2. We graduated and he found out that nobody cares that you were a star linebacker after high school. 3, there was this big fight between him and this other kid who was a pretty big jerk. Everyone knew it was coming and there was a decent sized crowd. Everyone was rooting for him. He ended up really beating the guy pretty badly, which I think shocked most of the kids. Fights at school usually got broken up pretty quickly, but this was after school, off site, so there was no authority figure there to stop it. Then he smashed the kids car windows with a tire iron before whipping it out and urinating on the kid who was still unconscious. This was before camera phones, but someone brought a digital camcorder and The video wound up on a couple websites. Everyone in school wound up seeing it and no one really looked at that kid the same way again. 4, we didn't see him much after he knocked up his girlfriend and had to drop out of seventh grade. I'm not joking. They were both seventh grader preteens. They kept the baby and their families made him drop out and get a job to support it. This was in the US in the 90s, and it's super sad. Five, to quote a close friend of mine, he was cool when he was 13 and then he never changed. Six, let this be a lesson to parents. Listen to your kids when they say they're sick. Back in 7th grade, there was this kid. Let's call him Greg. He wasn't super popular, but he had lots of friends and got along with everyone. One day during lunch, Greg's friend group tried to sit at our table, but there wasn't enough room. When we asked why they didn't just sit at their usual spot, one of them pointed at Greg, who was sitting all alone, and said, Greg went No. 2 on himself in class and smells really bad. The poor kid just sat there staring at a wall the entire lunch period. I'll never forget that face either. He was just completely void of all emotion. It was so sad to look at. I've never seen anyone look so hollow. Later we found Out. Greg had a stomach bug, but since he didn't have a fever, his mom sent him to school anyway. During class, he had the accident and it was so loud it was impossible to ignore. He ran to the bathroom leaving a trail behind. The worst part of it all, though, was that it happened early in the morning and his mother came to deliver him a change of pants but didn't pick him up or anything. The poor kid had to sit through the rest of the school day. I look back on that and still think about how crazy it was that within a day he lost every one of his friends and his entire social life was ruined. For the next 5 years, even in high school, he was known as the kid who had that accident in 7th grade.

I succeeded. One night I put a bigger one on her forehead after she dozed off, half used and would come off very easily so the glue and suction wouldn't have left a Mark, and went to brush my teeth. Few minutes later she came in, looks in the mirror, stares, and very groggily and dryly said why is there a googly eye on my head?

As a UPS driver, a customer once asked what's in the package? I was stunned by the stupidity and replied, no idea you ordered it. 2. While shopping at Costco, I was looking at the salmon when another customer came up, looked at the salmon, and asked, where is this from? I sarcastically said, space. He said thank you and walked away. Three. At a gas station, a customer asked, hey, the bathroom door is locked, can I get a key? I replied, there's no key. If it's locked, someone's in there. They asked, how does it know? I said, how does what know? They clarified, how does the bathroom know someone is in there? I had to explain, people. People go in and then they lock the door. Four. I work at a hotel. A client once asked if I book a room, does it include the bed? I replied, no sir, we only provide a chair so you can sit and wait until checkout time. 5. While at a drive through, the person in front of me asked if they could have their food to go. 6. I worked on a Christmas tree farm over winter break in college. A lady once asked, so what are these trees made out of? 7. A guy on the phone said, yes, I understand. I haven't paid my credit card Bill in three months, but why can't I use My card. I replied, because you haven't paid your Bill in three months. 8 I ran a lawn mowing service. A new customer asked, do you come to my house to mow it? I said, no, we pick it up and haul it to our special mowing center, then bring it back. 9 back when I did tech support, I received a call from a customer with a peculiar keyboard problem. He said, I'm having trouble with a shift key. When I type a letter with a shift key, it gives me the uppercase letter, but when I type a number, it doesn't give me the uppercase number. I had to break it to him gently. 10 while working at a call center asking people to pay their old bills, I had this exchange. Customer so this is what you do all day? Just call people who haven't paid their bills? Me yes. Customer so if I paid my bills, you'd be out of a job? Me if everybody paid their bills, then yes. Customer haha, good. You just messed up by telling me this. I'm going to pay my bills right away. When you're unemployed, then see how you like getting calls about your bills.

One. When cake mixes first came out, you only had to add water to them. However, many housewives felt like this was cheating and wouldn't buy the mixes, so cake mix companies added an extra step. The eggs. It worked! Apparently the act of cracking and adding eggs to the batter was enough to make it feel more homemade, and cake mixes became extremely popular. Two. That minty, fresh, zesty, clean feeling you get from toothpaste started as a marketing strategy. It caught on, and now almost all toothpaste is mint flavored because we associate the mint freshness with cleanliness. Three. Airport security Homeland Security zone inspectors were able to get illegal items through TSA checkpoint 70% of the time. The increased security measures give travelers a sense of safety, but they may not be as effective as we think. 4. As an IT person, I've noticed that giving a user a new monitor will make them swear that their computer is faster. 5. The exaggerated sounds of some vacuum cleaners, microwaves, and cars are designed to make them sound more powerful. Similarly, the loading screens on some apps are created to make it seem like they are performing complex tasks, even if they AREN'T. Six. The original Febreeze was unscented, but people didn't believe it worked, so the company added a scent to it and suddenly people felt it was more effective. 7. Beats headphones have weights inside Them to make them heavier, giving the illusion of quality and sturdiness. 8. Have you ever noticed how long it takes a coin star machine to process and count coins and return a receipt? It actually finishes counting very quickly, but people were skeptical of its accuracy, so a fake delay with artificial counting noises was added to give users more confidence in the results. Nine loading spinners on web pages. I once had a user complain that a web app was too slow even though it was performing well. To test him, I made the animation spinner spin faster. He later praised me to my boss, saying that the web app was now much faster. 10. Car doors are designed to close loudly, even though they could be made to close quietly. The loud thunk sound gives people a sense of safety and sturdiness. 11. My dog's medicine becomes mysteriously treat like when it comes out of his treat tin instead of the medicine packaging. Seconds ago it was a disgusting medicine, but the placebo effect from the treat tin changes his perception. 12. The idea that free shipping is a better deal. In most cases, the cost of shipping has already been added to the product price. However, people feel like they've gotten a better deal when they see free shipping.

Since my hands were full, I'd use one of her outstretched paws to turn on lights whenever we entered a room. Now the little rascal switches them on and off for fun. 2, our cat had impacted anal glands. For a while, we had to bribe him with treats to let us check on him. Now, whenever he wants a treat, he comes up and sticks his butt in our faces. 3, my niece loves facetiming my mom to talk to her dog. When the dog was a puppy, my mom would pull her onto her lap when she Facetimed. Now the dog is 80 pounds and will jump in your lap whenever your phone or tablet starts making the Facetime ringtone. 4, I used to pick my kitten up to kill spiders for me that were up high. Now whenever I pick her up, she looks up at the ceiling and starts searching for spiders. 5. My dog knew he'd always get ice to chew whenever I went to the fridge. So anytime he heard the ice machine start, he'd come running. Once he became deaf, he'd feel the vibrations in the floor and knew it was ice time. 6. I take baths with my cat by letting her float in a plastic box. I keep the box in my closet. I only started doing this. About a month ago, but now whenever I turn the bath water on, she runs to the closet and jumps in her box. 7. I would playfully grab my dog's snout when we were playing. He somehow figured out it's my favorite thing to do whenever he comes over. Now, every time he senses that I'm upset or sees that I'm crying, he'll come up and gently put his snout in my hand. 8. After my roommate got a cat, my dog started answering to Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, because he wants love and treats just like the cat. Nine, somewhere along the way, my dog Learned that get your toy means to pick up the nearest toy. I didn't train him to do it, but it comes in handy when I want him to bring a toy inside. If no toy is around, he'll grab the nearest soft thing, usually some piece of clothing. One time he even tried to pick up the cat.

One, I was stabbed in the neck by someone robbing my house. I totally thought I was going to die. I hate myself, but I begged the guy who stabbed me to stay because I didn't want to die alone. He said sorry and walked away. That fucking broke my heart. Thankfully, he called 9 1 1 for me. 2. Was run over by a bus last year. My thought when I went under the tires was, but it's a Wednesday. 3. I was in a fight and I didn't know I was stabbed in the liver and the lung. I walked away with my friend and collapsed in an alley. I remember bleeding out with calming waves of euphoria washing over me and I thought, I've lived enough. I'm okay with this. Blacked out and woke up in the back of an ambulance with waves of immense pain assaulting my body. Dying isn't awful. Surviving is awful. 4. Your shoe is untied. I said that to my dad before promptly falling down a 20F cliff into the underbrush. Broken arm, fractured skull, ruptured kidney. Woke up two weeks later to my dad saying thanks for letting him know his shoe was untied as he could have tripped. 5. I was in the process of being electrocuted having been working all day at top of Scissors lift. The electricians had left a 2 77 volt line live and While I was standing and reaching while running the last low voltage run of the job, I contacted their line. I saw the white light at the end of the tunnel. All I knew was throbbing and 60 cycle noise in the white light. My last thought was, I wonder if I can tell my knees to unlock. Obviously they did. Since I am here typing this, several electrical burns. Still here living the life. 6, my heart stopped beating for seven seconds while I was eating dinner in my hospital bed waiting to be discharged. I realized I was going to pass out and put my arm across my plate so I wouldn't fall face first into it. All I could think of was this is gonna make a mess. Glad they took their time with the paperwork. Ended up walking out of there seven days later with a pacemaker at the age of 46. Seven. That's it. As I looked at the surface of the water, I couldn't reach. 8. I remember having a piece of food lodged into my throat at a young age. I was standing there thinking, well, this is it and I just accepted it. I really don't understand it because I'm terrified of death. So I don't get how I just accepted it. But yeah. 9, as I was getting the hemlock, I remember thinking how embarrassing it would be to die at a Renaissance fair. 10. I thought about how I didn't. Buy enough pizzas from my favorite pizza place. It's pretty good. But thinking about pizza when you think you're dying is pretty depressing in retrospect. 11, I almost died in a fiery explosion at my old job. My first thought was, I'm gonna look like such an idiot without eyebrows.

One, not oh shit bad, oh shit, I can't believe she said that. First jury trial, pretty serious charges. I'm cross examining the alleged victim and in answering my question she says, oh yeah, I lie all the time. Needless to say, I won that trial. 2. A friend of mine was defending a guy in court. Don't remember what he was charged with. The main witness for prosecution was on the stand and was asked if she could identify the defendant. She was scanning the courtroom and seemed confused. My friend was already silently celebrating because if she couldn't identify him, he could probably get all charge dropped. As he was mentally adding this case to the win file, he happened to glance over at his client who had just helpfully raised his hand to make it easier for her to identify him. Even the judge face palmed on that one. 3. Never ask a question to which you don't know the answer. Prosecutor suggested to me client that the canned goods he had burgled were to be used to trade for drugs. Me thinking the idea ludicrous. Asked my client whether he has ever traded food for drugs to which he replied that he once exchanged a frozen chicken for heroin. Needless to say I didn't win that. 1. 4. A lawyer I used to know was in court on a work injury case. The judge asked His client, just what is the nature of your injury? His client replied, I can't raise my arm this high anymore. While she raised her arm up to show just how high she couldn't raise it. 5. Watching a hearing when the defendant said, I mean, I did stab her, but it was a gentle stabbing. 6. I was the dumbass that almost screwed myself. I had two charges in two different courts. I accepted the first plea, which almost always carries probation, but my plea didn't have that condition. When it came time to accept the second plea, the prosecutor didn't include probation because she assumed my first charge put me on probation. She said as much to the judge and me being a big dummy almost corrected her. My lawyer grabbed my shoulder and I shit you not told me to shut the fuck up. She doesn't know. Never interrupt your enemy when they're making a mistake.

One. My girlfriend hates mustard. I have a personal sauce that I make for burgers and she asks if it has mustard in it. I say no. She loves it and I've made it multiple times since then. She's even requested it a few times. Little does she know, it has a decent amount of mustard in it. 2. Yes, I would love to travel six hours to see your family. 3. My girlfriend can't sleep sometimes. I told her there is a pressure point on her lower neck that, if pressed, induces sleepiness. When she can't sleep, I will press on it to placebo her to into getting tired and falling asleep. 4. Me and my husband live in an area where it doesn't rain frequently, but when it does, we get a ton of snails. He would get sad because we'd see some snails that have been stepped on, so I told him that they were an invasive species so he wouldn't feel so bad about them getting smushed. Five. Our child took their first steps when I was visiting my parents a few hours away while my husband was at work later that evening. He got home shortly after I did, and our daughter took a few steps toward him when he came in the house. He got extremely excited thinking those were her first steps, so I just went with it and got Excited too. She's 14 now. I've never told him the truth. 6. He's a chef and I'm a picky eater. I don't want to complain because he still took the time to make it and I can't cook at all. 7 yeah, I really enjoy it when your brother and his wife come visit us. Cannot stand either one of them and find his brother to be an obnoxious idiot. 8. I insist that his old man Flemmy sinus clearing coughs in the morning don't bother me. He can't help it, but man they are rough and gross to listen to. 9. I've never told my husband what a horrible dancer he is. Horrible. He always wants to dance, but I usually tell him I'm tired or my feet hurt. If the dance floor is crowded, I'll dance with him. But in the middle of the dance floor, surrounded by people? Love that man to death though. He has a million amazing qualities and I'm the luckiest woman alive. Also, I'm pretty sure he could name quite a few things about me that he's not too fond of. 10. I never lie to my spouse. Tried once to withhold that I won $500 on a scratch ticket and told on myself before I got my coat off. 11. I don't know if this counts, but I tell my girlfriend I'm hungry so she'll also eat something. 12. I once claimed to have made the sauce for a meal when it Was out of a bottle

I paid for it, so it's mine. Breakup story. My ex boyfriend, Travis and I had been together for five years when he decided he was upgrading to someone younger. The breakup was messy, but the real drama started when we had to divide our stuff. Travis immediately claimed our apartment's gaming setup. A five thousand dollar PC, triple monitors, the works. He said since he was the real gamer, it was obviously his. You barely even use it, he argued. You just play Stardew Valley. True, but not the point. Then he went after my book collection. Three floor to ceiling shelves, first editions, signed copies. About $8,000 worth. Books are communal property, he said. Besides, I helped you move them in. Audacity. But his main target was our Tesla Model 3. We bought it together two years ago. Both names on the loan, but he'd been the primary driver. You don't even like driving, he said. I'll buy out your half. His offer? Five thousand dollars for my 20 thousand dollar share. I stayed calm and started documenting everything. Every payment, every receipt, every text message. That's when I found the gold mine. See, Travis was meticulous about splitting costs. He had this whole spreadsheet tracking who paid for what, down to the penny. He'd insisted on it, saying it would prevent arguments. According to his own records, I'd paid 73% of the Tesla payments. I'd bought 90% of the books. I'd paid for the Entire gaming setup. Why? Because Travis had been between jobs for three of our five years together. I'd covered most expenses while he pursued his passion. Streaming to 12 viewers on Twitch.

Our class clown loved to piss off teachers. He'd interrupt lessons with dumb jokes, pull pranks in the middle of lectures, and always try to get a laugh, no matter the cost. Most of the time, it was harmless, just loud and annoying. But one day, he pushed it too far. I remember we were sitting in history when he leaned over and whispered that he was starving. And he smirked and said he had a genius plan. There was this rumor going around that the teacher's lounge had a vending machine that didn't cost anything, just free snacks sitting there waiting to be taken. He said he was going to sneak in, raid the machine, and bring back food for everyone in our class. Of course, we all egged him on. It was typical of him to do something outrageous. And honestly, most of us wanted chips more than we cared about. What could go wrong? The next period, the teacher started taking attendance. When she called his name, no one said a word. She just marked him as absent and moved on. But we all knew exactly where he was. Slipped away in between classes and was already on his mission. We expected him to burst through the door with a bag full of candy and chips, probably tossing snacks like a hero. Only that never happened. The whole class waited, but he didn't come back. At first, we thought He got caught. Then someone whispered, he got suspended. But when our teacher came in the next day, she looked visibly shaken, read through attendance quickly, and skipped right over his name. Someone finally asked where he was. That's when she sighed and told us what really happened. He had made it into the teacher's lounge and managed to grab a ton of stuff from the vending machine. But one item got stuck. He started shaking the machine, trying to dislodge it, when the whole thing tipped forward and crashed on top of him. It completely crushed his leg. The school had to call paramedics, and he was rushed to the hospital. It was bad. He had surgery and was going to be in a wheelchair for a long time. When he eventually came back to school weeks later, rolling into class with a brace and crutches, the room went silent. Nobody laughed. He didn't smile or make a single joke.

Stuff most adults wouldn't even glance at. One morning, the principal came on the intercom, clearly rattled. He announced that someone had hacked the school's website. The entire site had been replaced with a black screen and a single countdown timer. No text, no logo. Just time ticking down, second by second. I tried everything. They rebooted servers, scanned for malware, pulled backups. Nothing worked. The district's tech team came in the same day, and they couldn't crack it either. No matter what they did, the timer stayed up. Everyone started freaking out. Nobody knew what it was counting down to. Some students thought it was a prank. Others thought it would leak grades, private files, even disciplinary records. Teachers were backing up everything. The administration was panicking. The police got involved by day three, but even they couldn't trace the source. Whoever had done it knew what they were doing. That timer ticked away all week. You could feel the pressure building every day. By Thursday, the tension was unbearable. Everyone was watching the clock. Friday came. The countdown hit zero at 12:15

It added what she called just a tiny dash of peanut butter to the frosting for extra flavor. She thought allergies were like being lactose intolerant, where you just get a stomachache or something. But here's the part that still makes me angry. When I went back to school the next week, Ashley tried to make it seem like it was my fault. I didn't know he was that allergic. He told people He should have been more careful. She acted like I had overreacted. Like almost dying was something I did on purpose for attention. She even said I was being dramatic about the whole thing. Most people avoided her after that.

God, Jason, are you always this paranoid? You don't look allergic. I stared at her. What does that even mean? You just don't, like, you seem totally normal. I thought people with allergies looked sick or something. Her friends started gathering around us, and I could feel everyone staring. That's not how allergies work, I said. Come on. One of her friends said. Just eat the cookie. What's the worst that could happen? I could literally die, I said, and they all started laughing. Don't be such a baby boy, another friend said. Mister Epi over here is scared of a cookie. Ashley rolled her eyes. Seriously, Jason, I told you, it's fine. Do you not trust me? I felt trapped. Here I was at my crush's party, and everyone was staring at me like I was being ridiculous. Ashley looked hurt that I didn't trust her. Her friends were calling me names. I didn't want to seem rude or paranoid. Fine, I said, and took the cookie. I bit into half of it. It tasted normal. Just sweet chocolate and vanilla frosting. For a second, I thought maybe I had been overthinking everything. Then four minutes later, my throat started feeling tight. My skin began turning red and getting itchy. I started having trouble breathing. By the time I realized what was happening, my legs gave out and I collapsed on Ashley's lawn. Someone screamed. People started running around, panicking. Ashley was standing over me looking confused. Wait. Is this like a prank or something? She asked. My best friend Carlos was at the party. He saw what was happening and immediately grabbed my Epipen from my pocket.

Every Christmas morning in our house felt like a lottery ticket that I could never win. My family had this weird tradition where my mom would write all four of our names on pieces of paper, fold them up and drop them in an old coffee mug. Whoever's name got picked would receive the golden gift, something expensive, personal or just really special. The rest of us got the usual stuff, socks with cartoon characters, a book we probably wouldn't read, or those cheap gift sets from the drugstore. When I was little, it seemed fair enough. Random chance, right? But by the time I hit 17, I started doing some basic math that made my stomach hurt. Four kids, 17 years of Christmas mornings, I had never been picked, not once. I brought it up casually one year while we were cleaning up wrapping paper. Guess I'm just really unlucky with that hat. I laughed, trying to keep it light. My mom looked up from stuffing gift bags into trash bags. Oh, honey, it's completely random. Your turn will come eventually. That year, my little brother Jake got a brand new PlayStation. I got a vanilla candle that smelled like the inside of a department store. I smiled, played along, helped Jake set up his console like the good big sister I was supposed to be. But something was bothering me and I couldn't shake it. The next few Christmases, I started paying closer attention. The pieces of paper never looked quite the same size. Some are folded differently. And my mom always seemed to fumble around in that mug for longer than necessary, like she was.

It was my mom. Emergency family meeting. Come home now or we're done. I'm thinking someone's in the hospital or died. I tell my manager it's an emergency and race home, my heart hounding the entire 20 minute drive. I pull into our driveway and see cars everywhere. My aunt's Honda, my uncle's pickup, my cousin Stephanie's beat up Corolla. Even my grandparents ancient Buick is parked crooked on the lawn. I walk through the front door and freeze. Our living room is packed with teen family members sitting in chairs they dragged from the kitchen and dining room. It looks like an intervention setup from those reality TV shows. My mom stands up holding a thick stack of printed papers. Her face is stone cold serious. We know about the Instagram account. My stomach drops to the floor. They found my fitness page six months ago. I started posting workout videos and healthy meal content. Nothing crazy, just me and gym clothes, showing proper form and sharing tips. Kept it completely secret from my ultra conservative religious family because I knew they'd lose their minds. The page exploded faster than I ever imagined. I now have 187,000 followers and make about $3,200 a month from sponsorships, protein powder companies, and workout gear brands. I've been secretly saving every single penny to move out and maybe start my own personal training business. This is absolutely disgusting. My Aunt Martha spits out waving printouts of My post half naked photos for complete strangers on the internet. My dad's face is red with anger. You're bringing shame and embarrassment to our family name. What will people at church think when they see this garbage? My younger sister Madison, who I thought would maybe understand since she's only 22, shakes her head in disappointment. I can't believe you've been living this.

Two hours later, I'm staring at documents. $2.1 million, a house investment. All mine. But I'm adopted, I stammered. Margaret handed me a letter in Grandma's handwriting. Austin, you are not adopted.

So I decided to make her want to be child free too. I'm 26, child free by choice, and love my peaceful life. My brother Jason and his wife Amber have three kids under six. Pure chaos. Amber constantly lectures me about how I'm missing out and need to grow up. She posts aggressive Facebook memes about how real women become mothers and corners me at family events saying I'm depriving myself of purpose. Last Friday they called asking me to babysit Saturday for a wedding. I politely declined. I had plans with my friend Clara to go river tubing. We've been planning this for weeks. Amber lost it, screaming about how I'm selfish and need to learn real responsibility. She ended the call with you need to grow up, Zoe. Saturday morning at 7:00am, I woke up to aggressive banging on my door. There were all three kids. Five year old Liam clutching a tablet, three year old Ava in a tutu with one sock, and Baby Jackson screaming in his carrier. A sticky note on my door read be back Sunday. Thanks, Auntie Zoe. They literally just dumped them like Amazon packages and drove off to their wedding. I called Jason. Straight to voicemail, texted Amber. Nothing. They turned off their phones expecting me to just suck it up and cancel my Life for their convenience. This was their master plan. Force me into parenting to prove I was wrong about being childfree. Most people would stay home and complain. Not me. They wanted to prove I needed this experience. Fine. I'd give them an experience they'd never forget. I packed all three kids in waterproof gear and took them river tubing. Anyway, Clara met us at the launch, took one look at the chaos and said, you're absolutely insane. Then helped me strap Liam into a life vest like the saint she is. For two hours, we floated down the French Broad River. Ava wore glitter sunglasses and sang frozen.

I run a barbecue food truck, and let me tell you, street vending is like the Wild West. No matter how good your brisket is, you're always one bad inspection away from losing everything. There's this one corner downtown that's gold. Heavy foot traffic, office workers at lunch, weekend festivals, you name it. The city only allows one truck there at a time, and you have to book it through their online permit system months in advance. It's first come, first served, and if you miss your day, too bad, you can't just swap in another truck without city approval. So I book my Friday slot three months ahead. I'm there early, set up smoker going, the works. Around 11 a m, another food truck rolls up. Bright neon paint job, giant Cartoon Taco plastered on the side. It's Taco titan, run by a guy named Vince. Vince jumps out in sunglasses and a leather jacket because apparently he's auditioning for Food Network's Douchebags in the wild. I'm taking this spot today. He says like it's a done deal. I laugh, thinking he's joking. Uh, no. I've got the permit. You can check with the city. He smirks. Oh, I don't need to check. See, your truck's a Dinosaur. I'm bringing in something fresh, Instagram worthy. People want tacos? Cool. I say you can give them tacos somewhere you're actually booked. Then he drops it. I've been parking here for Years without a permit. They never check. And you know what? If you call the city, I'll just tell them you invited me. Now, I'm a reasonable guy, but this is my living. My smoker takes four hours to get to 10. Moving is not an option. So I tell him straight, if you park here without a permit, that's on you. He parks anyway, right in front of my truck, like, literally blocking half my signage. At first, I'm pissed, but then I remember something. Fridays are when the city inspector does his random rounds downtown. They check permits, sanitation and fire safety. And the inspector, he's a no B S. Kind of guy. So I do.

Her boyfriend is so mysterious and she's obsessed with him. Meanwhile, you texted me 12 times about being nervous for your presentation. The way she said it made me feel like I was some kind of burden. I wish you were more mysterious, more of a challenge. I should have known this would end badly when three weeks later she'd be crying at my door. But that night I just felt hurt and said, fine, I'll be mysterious that night. I usually would have texted her good night, but I didn't and it felt wrong not doing it. She sent me three question marks right away and I just wrote back all good and left it at that. Saturday morning came and normally I text her about my coffee and ask what she was up to, but I kept my phone in my pocket. By noon, she was texting you okay and I just sent a thumbs up, which killed me because I actually wanted to talk to her. Monday was the worst because I got the promotion I've been working for and all I wanted was to call her and celebrate. When we went to dinner that Night she asked about my day and I just said same old while scrolling through my phone, even though inside I was bursting to tell her. She leaned across the table trying to figure out what was going on with me. You seem different, she said. Good, different. And the crazy part was she seemed more into me than she had in months, which made me feel powerful but also completely hollow inside. The second week, she started showing up at my place without calling first and cooking these fancy dinners, basically doing anything to crack me open. I can't figure you out anymore, she said. Wednesday night, and she sounded excited about it. Britney so jealous. She as I got the mysterious boyfriend Jackpot. I wanted to tell her how dumb this whole thing was and how much I missed just talking to her normally, but I just shrugged and kept watching TV. my dad called because my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery and he was freaking out. I spent three hours calming him down while Jess sat next to me trying to figure out what was happening. After I hung up, she asked, is everything okay? And I wanted to fall into her arms and tell her everything, family, stuff. I said instead, it's handled. She killed me harder than she had in months and whispered, you're so strong. But I wasn't strong at all. I was just pretending. The third Thursday night at Eleven PM, Jess showed up at my door with her makeup running down, her face shaking.

Just take the voucher. I told him.

Al sacarla se quedó impresionado. Tenía las manos llenas de salsa de curry. Nunca antes había cambiado un pañal, así que se preparó con equipo profesional. Al levantar el pañal, casi vomita los tomates que había comido hace un par de años, tomates salteados. Aguantaron las ganas de vomitar y limpiaron el trasero del bebé con todo lo que tenían. Parecía una cirugía mayor. Después de media hora por fin quedó limpio y lograron poner un pañal limpio. Estaban a punto de celebrar, pero no habían dejado pasar ni 2 segundos cuando escucharon una serie de pedos. Sí volvió a hacer popó. Se derrumbaron instantáneamente. Ese bebé había sido encontrado en la cama de su propia casa rural. Pensaban que era un muñeco, pero hacía mucho tiempo que no tenían huéspedes y no sabían quién lo había dejado. Carlos iba a llevarlo a la policía, pero maría pensó que sus padres volverían pronto a buscarlo, así que le pidió que lo cuidara de momento. Lo curioso era que carlos lloraba sentado, pero sonreía cuando estaba de pie. No les quedó más remedio que cargar al bebé y pasear. Después de horas sin poder más, decidieron turnarse liberando las correas. Entonces los 3 fueron al supermercado a comprar leche para bebés, pero solo quedaba una lata. Aunque llegaron primero, una mujer irracional se la llevó. Lo peor fue que el empleado les pidió sin más que se rindieran, pero al escuchar Eso explotaron de ira. Solo porque soy hombre tengo que ceder. ¿Por qué la mujer no dejaba de justificarse? Ellos pensaron que creía que no podían pagar y la insultaron sin freno. Luego ella arrancó la leche y sin razón alguna se enojó aún más. No entiendo por qué tanta rabia. Los 3 gastaron todos sus ahorros en esa lata. Cuando maría levantó la lata, ya no era solo una lata de leche, era un trofeo, era una medalla olímpica. Pero olvidaron que si mañana no sopla el viento, ni siquiera tendrán el viento del noroeste. Como dice el refrán, lo bueno vuelve. El adorable bebé trajo la atención de un grupo de mujeres extranjeras y casualmente estaban buscando alojamiento. Así, la casa rural a punto de cerrar se llenó en una noche, pero carlos lo pasó mal. Después de solo un día con el bebé ya parecía 10 años mayor. Lo vieron tan agotado que le dijeron que usara mascarillas para los ojos. Carlos dijo que no ayudaban. María escuchó eso emocionada. Dijo que no era culpa de las mascarillas, sino de no usar el producto correcto. Y maría tenía razón, solo funciona con el producto adecuado. De repente, el bebé empezó a llorar de hambre. Los 3 pusieron al niño sobre la mesa y fueron a preparar la leche en polvo en la cocina. Cuando volvieron, el niño no estaba. Vieron una sombra negra salir corriendo a toda velocidad por la puerta. Los 3 salieron corriendo tras ella Dieron toda la vuelta a corea. Por fin atraparon al sospechoso de negro.

So at my final divorce hearing, I wasn't supposed to say anything. My lawyer even told me to zip it and let him handle everything. My ex husband, Tyler, had been caught stealing money from his job and tried to pin it all on me with fake papers and forge signatures. The whole thing was insane. For over a year, cops were at my house, my bank accounts got frozen, and people I thought were friends basically ghosted me. Meanwhile, Tyler's walking around like he's some misunderstood victim. And he even brought his new girlfriend to court. Yeah, the same girl he was cheating on me with while I was home with our twin boys. The courtroom was packed. Tyler had his whole family there supporting him. I just had my sister Kim and my lawyer. The prosecutor had just finished showing all the evidence that proved Tyler not only forged my name on loan papers, but also used our kids social security numbers to open fake credit cards. Like, who does that to their own children? When the judge asked Tyler if he wanted to say anything, of course he stood up and gave this whole sob story about being a devoted father and husband who was just trying to provide for his family. He actually had the nerve to say that I had manipulated the situation and that everyone in the courtroom knew I wasn't The innocent person I was pretending to be when he sat down. He had this smug little smile on his face like he just won an Oscar. Then the judge looked right at me and asked if I wanted to say anything before the final decision. I hadn't planned on speaking at all, but something inside me just snapped. Maybe it was seeing his girlfriend sitting there in the front row.

So I introduced him to my actual boyfriend. For 8 months, sane, acted like my boyfriend in every way possible. We hung out four times a week. He'd sleep over constantly, even had his own drawer at my place. He'd get visibly jealous whenever other guys talk to me at parties, always finding excuse, this is to interrupt conversations or pull me away. He bought me flowers just because, remembered my coffee order perfectly. And we'd spend entire weekends together binge watching shows and cooking dinner like a real couple. My friends all assumed we were dating. My family invited him to barbecue. Even his mom would ask about his girlfriend when she called. But whenever anyone directly asked if we were together, Zane would laugh it off awkwardly. Oh, no, we're just really close friends. I'm not ready for anything serious right now. It stung every single time, but I kept hoping he'd come around. I thought maybe he just needed more time to feel comfortable with labels. Last Friday night changed everything. We were at Kelsey's birthday party and this girl, Alexis from his work showed up. She was clear flirting with him all night, touching his arm, laughing way too loud at his jokes. Finally, she looked me up and down and asked directly, so are you his girlfriend or what? Without hesitation, Zane immediately said, oh, no, we're definitely not together. I'm completely single. Actually, he even stepped lightly. Away from me. When he said it, the humiliation hit me like a truck. Everyone with an earshot was staring. Kelsey looked mortified. For me, I felt my cheeks burning with embarrassment. But instead of running away, crying like I want.

She's 12. Ava is 12. Every night she checks our door locks three times. She's done this since her mom died from cancer when she was 6. I married her dad when she was 9. I thought I was helping them both. Turns out only one needed help. I'm the one who knows she likes her sandwiches cut corner to corner. I'm the one who sits with her during panic attacks. Her dad. He's either gone for work or home drinking. I do everything for her. One Tuesday morning, Ava grabbed my arm. Don't go to work, please. Dad's home. Her hands shook so bad she couldn't tie her shoes. I had a big meeting at 10:01 that would get me a promotion. I have to go, sweetie. Two hours later, during my meeting, my phone lit up. Mom, please come home. She had never called me mom before. Not once in three years. Then her phone went dead. I left the meeting. Ava had called twenty times. Her voicemail wasn't working. I drove home fast and found my husband drinking beer and watching TV. Where's Ava? I asked. He said he dropped her at his drug dealer's house. What? I drove there, going through three red lights. Found Ava locked in a bedroom. A party was happening outside. Beer cans everywhere. She rocked back and forth the whole drive home. She wouldn't talk, she wouldn't eat. That night, I found her Diary while she slept. Dad brings his friends over when Lizzie's gone. They smell weird. I hide in my closet. How did I miss this? I showed my husband the diary that night. What did he say? She's making it up. Stop treating her like a baby. I started packing our bags. He grabbed my wrist hard. She's my daughter, my family. If you leave, you go alone. I slept on Ava's floor that night. I woke up with her lying next to me. After she went to school, I put cameras in the living room and kitchen. I told him they were for robbers. He didn't care. He was too hungover to fight. Then I found another page in Ava's diary. She drew a picture of me. It said my real mom under it. Please don't leave me. If I needed proof to save my girl, I'd get proof. The cameras recorded everything. Him leaving Ava alone for six hours to go gamble. Him passed out drunk while she made cereal at midnight. Her pushing furniture against her door when his friends came over. Her teacher pulled me aside at pickup. She only smiles when you drop her off. She goes quiet when it's her dad. That's when I found a lawyer who used to work for child services. She watched three hours of foot page without stopping. Keep recording. We're building a solid case. Then my husband's dealer got arrested for drugs. My husband started deleting everything on His phone. Even Ava's emergency contacts. He. I was scared now. He kept asking why I worked late. He checked Ava's diary. She stopped writing. She stopped talking. She started pulling out her eyelashes again. She started wetting the bed. My lawyer watched new video of him shaking Ava for looking at him wrong. She nodded. One more thing. We need just one more. I hated that we needed him to hurt her again. Then it happened. Ava had a huge panic attack at school. She couldn't breathe. She threw up on her desk. School called Child Services. They came that day. I was listed as the main contact at school, so they called me in. Child services talk to Ava while I held her hand. She finally spoke. When Lizzie's gone, dad forgets I'm there until he gets mad. Child services started checking things right away. My husband got papers at work. He texted me, you'll pay for this. We went to court three days later. The judge watched my videos. Ava blocking her door. Him passed out while she made dinner at midnight. The judge's face turned angry. The stepmother is great. Into temporary custody. The father only gets visits with someone watching. That night, Ava slept for 10 hours straight. No checking locks, no bad dreams. First time in weeks. But his text sat on my phone. This isn't over. She's mine. My husband showed up drunk at Ava's school during lunch. He got to the cafeteria. And pulled her arm so hard it popped out of socket. She's stealing! You come with daddy now! Ava screamed so loud, three teachers came running. He pushed the principal hard. Security tackled him in the parking lot. Cops found drugs in his car on school property. It was over for him. Then Ava pulled out her phone. At the police station, she showed them pictures. Dozens she'd taken for months. And passed out. Bruises on her arms, drug pipes on the coffee table. I knew Lizzie would need proof, so I took pictures every time. She'd been planning our escape. The cops started crying. Honey, you're the bravest kid I've ever met. The charges kept coming. Hurting a child, drugs at school, breaking the court order. His lawyer quit right at the courthouse. I can't help this man. He called me from jail. Please don't take her. I hung up. His only choice. Give up his parent rights for less jail time. He signed the papers. Ava became mine by law. Now Ava doesn't check the locks anymore.

When I was 15, my older brother Eric left home after this huge screaming match with our dad. Dad had always been super strict about everything, grades, curfew, chores, you name it. But Eric was 18 and wanted to do his own thing. You know, they got into it over something stupid like Eric staying out past midnight on a weekend. I remember standing at the top of the stairs listening to them yell. Dad was going off about respect and responsibility and Eric was shouting back about how nothing he ever did was good enough. Then dad said the words that still give me chills. If you walk out that door, don't bother coming back. Eric grabbed his backpack, stuffed some clothes in it and slammed the front door so hard the whole house shook. Mom tried calling him that night, but his phone went straight to voicemail. She left like 20 messages. Dad just sat in his recliner watching TV, acting like nothing happened. But I could tell he was waiting for Eric to come crawling back. We all were. Days turned into weeks. Mom would set an extra plate at dinner out of habit, then quietly put it away. She'd leave Eric's bedroom door open and sometimes I'd catch her just standing there staring at his unmade bed. Dad never talked about it, but he started checking his phone constantly, probably hoping for a text or Something I kept thinking Eric would show up for my birthday in October or maybe Thanksgiving when Christmas came and went with no word. I figured he was just being stubborn. Maybe he got a job somewhere. Maybe he had a girlfriend. Maybe he was living his best life and just didn't want to deal with family drama. Mom would cry sometimes when she thought nobody was looking. She sit at the kitchen table late at night staring at her phone waiting for a call that never came. Dad would find her there in the morning and they'd have these weird quiet conversations that stopped when I walked in. Years went by. I graduated high school, started college. Sometimes I'd wonder if Eric even knew I existed anymore. I used to imagine running into him at a gas station or something and he'd be all successful and happy and we'd laugh about how stupid that fight was. I pictured him having kids someday that I'd never meet. The hardest part was how dad changed. He got softer with me. Like he was scared I'd leave, too. He'd ask about my friends, my classes, even offered to help with homework. He didn't understand. It was nice but also weird because I could tell he was thinking about Eric the whole time. Then I turned 21 and everything fell apart. I was at my apartment when this cop showed up at my door with an envelope. They've been trying to reach my Parents but couldn't get through. The letter was from the state police and it had Eric's name on it. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely read it. They'd found remains behind this old abandoned gas station about two towns over. Dental records confirmed it was Eric. The estimated time of death was about a month after he left home. Six years. He'd been dead for six whole years and we never knew. I drove home and found mom in the kitchen making dinner, like any other night when I told her.

My husband, Jake, lost his parents when he was 8 and his older sister, Becca, basically became his mom. She was only 16 at the time, but somehow managed to keep them both afloat. Jake always talked about how she gave up her teenage years to make sure he had clean clothes and hot meals. I get that their bond is special. I really do. But Becca acts like she owns Jake. When we first started dating three years ago, she'd call him every single night at exactly nine PM if he didn't pick up, she'd blow up his phone until he did. She needed to know where he was, who he was with, what he ate for dinner. It was weird, but Jake said it was normal for them. Then we moved in together last year. Becca had a spare key to our apartment. Within a week, he'd show up unannounced on Saturday mornings with groceries, reorganizing our fridge and telling me I was buying the wrong brand of cereal. For Jake, she knew his favorite everything better than I did and she made sure I knew it. The worst part was how she'd interrogate me about our relationship. She'd corner me in the kitchen while Jake was in the bathroom and ask stuff like, are you two using Protection and how often do you fight? When I told her it Wasn't her business get this hurt look and say I'm just looking out for my baby brother? Jake always defended her. He'd say I was being sensitive and that Becca just cared about us. But it got worse. After we got engaged 6 months ago, Becca demanded to see our bank statements because she needed to make sure Jake was making smart financial decisions. She wanted to approve our wedding venue, our guest list, even my dress. When I said no to helping pick my wedding dress, she cried to Jake about how I was shutting her out of important moments. Last month was the breaking point. Jake and I had our first real fight about money. Nothing crazy, just normal couple stuff about whether to buy a new couch or save the money. We talked it out and everything was fine. But somehow Becca found out. She called Jake the next day asking a million questions about what happened, if we were okay, if I was being unreasonable with money. Jake told her it was handled and to drop it. She didn't drop it. She showed up at our apartment that night with takeout and flowers, acting like we were getting divorced or something. She kept asking if we needed mediation and offered to help us communicate better like we were children. That's when I snapped. I looked her dead in the eye and said, Becca, you have no right to know everything about my marriage just because you Raised Jake. We're adults and our relationship is between us. He went completely silent. Then she started crying, not just tearing up but full on sobbing. She said I was ungrateful for everything she'd done for Jake, that she sacrificed her whole life for him and that I was trying to steal him away from her. Jake just sat there looking uncomfortable. He didn't defend me or tell her to back off. He just awkwardly patted her shoulder while she cried about how mean I was being. After she left, Jake was mad at me. He said Becca was just trying to help and that I hurt her feelings for no reason. We didn't talk for two days. But then something weird happened. Jake's best friend, Ryan, came over and heard the whole story. Ryan looked at Jake like he was crazy and said.

But the problem is, her mom started seducing me. Lately, every time I visit their house, she would wear the kind of dresses that are so revealing that it could easily cause car crashes. And she'd always accidentally drop things like forks, keys, and once even a whole blender. And then bends down, revealing her massive bottom to pick it up. And every time I help her pick it up, she would lean in and whisper, oh, my. Oh, my. Sweet Jesus. You've got strong hands, sweetheart. But I. I stayed loyal to my girl. Until one day, her mom called me at night and shouted, honey, help me! I am in danger. I need some urgent help. You are my 9 1 1. Please come fast. So naturally, I rushed over, thinking she actually needed help. But when I got there, she opened the door in a silky bathrobe smelling like strawberries. And then she smiled and said, ha ha ha ha! Oh, you silly. There is no emergency. Come upstairs. I've got a better surprise for you there. On hearing this, I stood frozen, and she walked off with her hips swinging like a pendulum of doom. And then she suddenly turned around, smiled, and said, if you want to experience a real woman before marriage, now is your only chance. I can do the kind of wild things to you that you can't even think of in your wildest dreams. On Hearing this, my wild animal instincts got activated instantly, and I said, Yippee! Tonight is going to be really memorable. Wait here. I'll be right back. And then I turned back, sprinted out the door, and jumped into my car. And as soon as I closed the door, I don't know how, but her whole family showed up with tears in their eyes in front of my car. And then her 11 sisters pulled me out of the car, hugged me, and one of them shouted, Congratulations. You are the first man ever to pass the test. Welcome to our family. And it's been three years now. We are a happy family of nine. But when I think about that day again, I was just lucky that I left the Protection in my car.

So I decided to make her want to be child free too. I'm 26, child free by choice and love my peaceful life. My brother Jason and his wife Amber have three kids under 6. Pure chaos. Amber constantly lectures me about how I'm missing out and need to grow up. She posts passive aggressive Facebook memes about how real women become mothers and corners me at family events saying I'm depriving myself of her. Last Friday they called asking me to babysit Saturday for a wedding. I politely declined. I had plans with my friend Clara to go river tubing. We've been planning this for weeks. Amber lost it screaming about how I'm selfish and need to learn real responsibility. She ended the call with, you need to grow up, Zoe. Saturday morning at 7:00am, I woke up to aggressive banging on my door. There were all three kids. Five year old Liam clutching a tablet, three year old Ava, a tutu with one sock and baby Jackson screaming in his carrier. A sticky note on my door read, be back Sunday. Thanks, Auntie Zoe. They'd literally just dumped them like Amazon packages and drove off to their wedding. I called Jason straight to voicemail, texted Amber, nothing. They'd turned off their phones expecting me to just suck it up and cancel my life. For their convenience, this was their master plan, force me into parenting to prove I was wrong about being childfree. Most people would stay home and complain, not me. They wanted to prove I needed this experience. Fine. I'd give them an experience they'd never forget. I packed all three kids in waterproof gear and took them river tubing anyway. Clara met us at the launch, took one look at the chaos and said you're absolutely insane. Then helped me strap Liam into a life vest like this. Think she is. For two hours, we floated down the French Broad River. Ava wore glitter sunglasses and sang frozen songs at every passing kayaker like she was performing at Carnegie Hall. Liam tried catching fish with his bare hands and nearly looked out of his tube twice. Jackson actually calmed down once we got moving. The motion and fresh air put him right to sleep. The other river goers stared at our bizarre parade. A guy in a canoe asked if they were all mine. No, I said cheerfully. Just the world's most reluctant babysitter taking revenge on manipulative relatives. After tubing, we hit this dog friendly taco truck lot near Clara's place. She brought her rescue mutt peaches, who immediately became the fourth child. Kids went absolutely wild over the picnic tables and dogs running around. We got them quesadillas with mild cheese and churros, which ended up mostly decorating Ava's face and hair. Jackson passed out in his stroller. Clutching half a churro like a trophy. I documented everything on Instagram. Photos of the kids laughing in tubes covered in churros, playing with dog dogs, looking absolutely delighted. I captioned it in prompt to adventure babysitting, sometimes the best lessons come from unexpected moments. Thanks for the practice run. By the time we got home, all three were exhausted but genuinely happy. They fell asleep within minutes. Ava on my couch with glitter still sparkling on her forehead. Liam snoring with one shoe mysteriously missing. Jackson sleeping like.

When I turned 15, my mom went from strict to straight up paranoid. One night after dinner, she plopped down next to me with this weird smile and said she was installing a family safety app on my phone. I watched her tap away, giving herself access to everything, my location, photos, texts, even my drafts on social media. It's just to keep you safe, honey, she said, handing my phone back like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. It felt like having a stalker who lived in my house. At first I tried to be cool about it. Maybe it would calm her down, right? Wrong. Things got insane fast. She text me in the middle of conversations asking who I was with. She'd comment on memes I hadn't even posted yet because she was reading my drafts. Worst part, she started replying to my friends pretending to be me. My buddy Jake texted asking if I wanted to hang out. And my mom replied, sure thing, buddy, with way too many exclamation points. Jake called me laughing, asking why I was texting like a soccer mom. I had no idea what he meant until I checked my messages. Then came the day that broke me. I was in history class when Mrs. Wilson pulled me aside. She looked uncomfortable as hell. Liam, your mother called the school. She's concerned about some message you sent about Me? My stomach dropped. I knew exactly what she meant. I texted my best friend Kyle the night before, joking about how our history teacher's haircut looked like she stuck her finger in an electrical socket. It was just stupid, but friend stuff, not meant for anyone else. But my mom had read it and called the school to complain about my private joke. I wanted to disappear into the floor. By lunch, Kyle wasn't talking to me. Neither was Jake. Word got around that my mom was reading everything and suddenly nobody wanted to text me anymore. Some kids even blocked me. It was like my social life had a disease and the disease was my mom. That night, I stared at my phone feeling trapped. But then I noticed something. The tracking app worked both ways. It logged every time someone accessed the account. I spent hours studying those logs and what I found made my skin crawl. My mom wasn't just checking my phone during the day. She was logging in at 1:00am, 2:00am, even 3:00am. She was forwarding my messages to her laptop. She was screenshotting my photos. He was living inside my phone 24 7. So I came up with a plan. I created a fake friend named Daniel, made up this whole persona, gave him a backstory, even found some random photos online to use as his profile pic on a group chat with myself.

He said, wouldn't you rather drive straight to the hospital? Is this some sort of joke? I asked when the officer said those strange words. Instead of asking for license and registration, the cop handed back my license that I'd already pulled out. His face had changed from stern authority to something softer and sadder. I just got radioed in about what happened. I'm terribly sorry for your loss, sir. Before I could ask what loss? He was already jogging back to his patrol car. He turned on his lights again, but this time pulled in front of me and blocked traffic so I could merge left immediately. Other cars moved aside as he created a clear path for me to speed the head. I sat there frozen for a moment before pressing the gas. My hands were trembling on the steering wheel as I tried to process what just happened. The cop knew something I didn't. Something bad enough that he'd let me go without even a warning about my speed. I fumbled for my phone while keeping one eye on the road. I just landed at LAX an hour ago after a three day business trip to see Seattle. My wife Carly hadn't answered when I called from baggage claim, but that wasn't unusual. She often had her phone on silent while teaching her kindergarten class. I called her again. Straight to voicemail. I tried our home phone. Nothing. My chest Started feeling tight as I scrolled to her sister's number. Voicemail. Her mom. Voicemail. My mom. No answer. The highway stretched ahead of me, but I wasn't really seeing it anymore. My mind was racing through possibilities. Car accident, house fire, something at her school. Each scenario worse than the last. The cop had said lost. That word kept echoing in my head. Finally, I called my brother Harvey. It rang four times before his wife, Paulina, answered. She was crying so hard, I could barely understand her. How can she do this? I don't understand why she would do this. Paulina kept repeating between sobs, what? What happened? Where's Carly? Is she okay? I was practically shouting into the phone. Paulina just cried harder. I heard Harvey's voice in the background telling her to give him the phone. There shuffling and muffled voices before the line went dead. I called back three times, but no one answered. I was doing 90 now, weaving between cars. Other drivers honked, but I didn't care. Something had happened to my wife, and no one would tell me what. The exit was coming up, and I took it without signaling. I knew that's where they take her. It was the closest trauma center to her school. The hospital parking lot was a maze, but I abandoned my car in the first spot I saw. Legal or not, I didn't care. I ran through the sliding doors into the emergency room lobby. The smell. Of disinfectant, and fear hit me immediately. I'm looking for my wife, Carly Munos. She was brought here. I didn't even know when or why. The nurse at the desk typed something into her computer. When she looked back up at me, her eyes were watery. She. I knew who I was before I'd even given my name. The security guard will escort you. Her voice was barely a whisper. A large man in a blue uniform appeared and gestured for me to follow. We walked through endless hallways, past rooms full of beeping machines and worried families. My legs felt like they might give out, but I kept moving. The guard didn't say a word, just kept glancing at me with that same sad look everyone seemed to have. We took an elevator to the third floor pediatric ICU. The sign said, why were we in pediatrics if Carly was hurt? My brain couldn't make sense of it. The guard LED me down another hallway, where I could hear crying. Multiple people sobbing behind a closed door. I recognized voices as we got closer. Harvey. Paulina. Carly.

One. I had a friend I was crushing on, and I thought he liked me, too. One day we were chatting online and he had to leave for work. Before logging off, he said, I'll be back later to spend more time with my favorite Asian. Confused, I asked, who's that? For as long as I knew him, he thought I was Asian. Once he found out I wasn't, he ghosted me. Two. I was at a dinner party and people kept offering me drinks that I continued to decline. Eventually, one woman's eyes lit up as she looked between me and my husband, and then she asked, oh my gosh, are you pregnant? Everyone around us got quiet, and I laughed and said, no, I have epilepsy. I was handed no more glasses of wine after that. 3. My ex wife was convinced I had another family in another state simply because she heard a kid's voice in the background when I was traveling for work and sitting in a restaurant. Once during divorce depositions, I spent a full day being questioned, and half the questions were slightly different wordings of so you have another family, kid, etcetera. 4. One time in Japan, I asked an old lady for directions in Japanese. I was still a beginner, but I tried my best to speak in their language rather than asking stuff in English. So this lady Assumed I spoke very good Japanese and started chatting. I tried telling her I couldn't understand and everyone else on the bus was trying to hide their laughter. The conversation went on for 10 minutes and I still have no idea what she was saying. She was very nice though. 5 I live in a very Hispanic slash Latino area and one woman heard me speak English and yelled at me for not speaking Spanish, calling me a traitor to my ancestors and bringing shame to my past family history in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Imagine her surprise when I told her I was Arab and Middle Eastern. Still felt guilty for not knowing Spanish for some reason lol. 6 people assumed as high school I was eating nothing but junk because I was rapidly gaining weight while my twin wasn't. In truth I was starving myself because I couldn't figure out why I was gaining weight. It wasn't until my 20s I found out I had a tumor on my thyroid and that's what caused the weight gain.

I was 14 and I was walking through the mall when I saw a girl my age sitting alone at the arcade playing a racing game by herself. She looked really lonely, mashing buttons and talking to the screen like she had someone to compete with, making sound effects and celebrating when she won races against nobody. So I decided to go over and challenge her to try and make her day better. I walked up to her and asked if I wanted to race against her and I saw her face just completely change. Really? You really wanna play against me? I told her yes and I asked her which game she wanted to play so I could show her some moves. I knew she got excited and was about to pick a two player game, but then at the last second she stopped. She grabbed her backpack and said, the last time someone asked to play games with me and I let them use my quarters, they took all my money and left me standing there with nothing. My mom called me stupid and said stupid kids don't deserve more arcade money and I had to save up my allowance for three weeks just to come back here. I'm not stupid anymore and I'm not sharing. She turned around clutching her bag tight and my heart broke for her. I walked back over and Pinky promised her I wasn't going to take her money and told her I'd use my own quarters right next to her so I couldn't steal anything. I even showed her my wallet to prove I had my own money. She ended up agreeing to play, and when I showed her the combo moves, she was absolutely amazed. She yelled, that's so awesome! Teach me how to do that! She then started practicing really hard, and although she was messing up the timing at first, she seemed so focused and determined. I'll beat you, just you watch, she said with this fierce look in her eyes. And then after a full hour of trying and failing and trying again, she pulled off the combo perfectly. When she did, she was so thrilled she jumped up and down screaming and called me her awesome new gaming buddy. We took turns playing different games the rest of the afternoon, and she kept getting better and better at everything I taught her. When I told her I had to go home, she looked disappointed, but then asked me if I wanted to meet.

One day, my daughter came up to me and told me she didn't want to stay at daddy's house anymore. I had split custody with my ex, but this was the first time when she outright refused to visit him for her scheduled week. I sat down beside her and asked her what was going on. Did daddy do something to upset you? Then she told me how daddy's new girlfriend would make her do strange things and also made her promise not to tell anyone. When I asked what these things were, my heart dropped into my stomach. She would make my daughter sit in front of a laptop camera and answer personal questions about her body. Then she would record everything and tell her it was just a game. At first, my daughter thought it was normal, but she eventually realized that something felt wrong and became scared. So she asked her to stop. And my ex's girlfriend grabbed my daughter by the shoulders and shook her hard. She went to her daddy to complain and told him everything while sobbing. But instead of protecting her, he told her to stop making up stories. He was under the impression that I had coached our daughter to say this and simply refused to listen to her. I was so furious, but also heartbroken at the same time. The first thing I did was call the police, but the officer Who showed up was my ex's golf buddy, who basically laughed in my face. He told me the same thing that my ex said to our daughter. Stop making up drama just because you can't handle your ex moving on. I don't know what kind of father my ex husband was being that he didn't even consider the possibility of his girlfriend actually doing this. But I knew one thing, which was I couldn't just sit there and do nothing. I sent my daughter to my sister's house before taking action. I was a regular at this gym where I had made friends with these two guys who had done some questionable things in their past. Both of them agreed to help me with my plan. We waited for my ex to leave for his business trip and broke into his house to find the girlfriend. I knew she worked from home, so she was probably in her office all day. She looked absolutely terrified when she saw me entering the house and tried to run, but we cornered her. You see, I was under the impression that she was just some creep getting her

I was a fan of the channel, mostly because some of the interviews are really interesting, but it started to get real shady. So he really lost me when I found out he posted this teenage girl on his YouTube channel even though she was topless. I saw that he recently did another interview with the girl and her mom. And as I'm doing research, getting ready to make a video about this, see, Mark Later's girlfriend passed away. Then I see all these videos on how she Od'd and how she's 22, but they started dating two and a half years ago. Like, I know you fucking lying. This shit gotta be AI. And then I watched a video of him addressing everything, and oh my god, this man says she is very mature for her age and how he's young at heart. Bro, what? You have a daughter that's older than her? 65. And then the way he was describing it, oh, I was paying all her bills and that is that. It's just a lot of Shady shit happening on that YouTube channel. More stuff I Learned, the more creeped out I get. The little snark remarks he's made about black women. His comments about the women in general.

Right. This happened in 2014, and no one was arrested until 2022. The story is pretty twisted. This is Donna Adelson, the grandmother, but we'll get back to her in a minute. This is her daughter, Wendy Adelson. And this was Wendy's husband, Dan Markel. Wendy and Dan created a life for a while until it just no longer worked. They got divorced, but then they ensued in a custody battle. You see, Wendy wanted to move 370 miles south of Tallahassee to southern Florida with their two sons. Dan was a law professor at Florida State University, and he absolutely refused to relocate. This was going to prevent Wendy from leaving with the kids. In comes Donna again. Apparently, Wendy's mother, Donna, wanted to help with the situation. This is her son over here, Charlie Adelson. Apparently, Donna master minded this murder for hire plot utilizing her son's ex girlfriend. Here's Charlie. Here's his girlfriend, Catherine. Here's Catherine's baby daddy. Tuto was friends with Louis, and these two were part of the Latin Kings gang. These two were apparently hired to take out Dan. Wendy and Donna's problem. On July of 2014, those two stalked him, followed him to his house, and ended up taking his life in his garage. Now, Dan's unaliving went unsolved for nearly a decade. It wasn't until 2022 that they were finally able to link this unaliving to the son Charlie. Adelson at that time it was found that Charlie and his then girlfriend Katie had hired these two to do the plot. Louis took a plea deal and is serving 19 years behind Bar. Tutu was found to be the trigger man, serving life behind bars. Charlie and Katie were also sentenced to a life behind bars. But let's not forget Donna and all of this who hated her son in law. Donna also avoided arrest for nearly a decade. She was being investigated, although she clearly denied that she had anything to do with this. Basically she let her son take the fall. But in November of 2023, Donna was arrested in the Miami International Airport. She had a one way ticket to Vietnam, which she later admitted that she was aware that they have a no extradition policy. She waited for quite some time for her trial, but on September 4th the judge handed down the verdict and she was found guilty. And she wailed and cried for nearly two minutes as the judge had to send the jury out while she collected herself. It was found that she had orchestrated this entire murder for hire plot, gotten together $100,000, which she came from a pretty affluent family and area anyways, and that she indeed did deserve to be behind bars.

I believe she started doing the ex work when she was like 12 or 13 years old and I'm just giving you all a general gist of the story because it was too hard to watch her videos. I'm sorry but this is her mom right here and this is not Nova's baby. This is the mom's baby. The mom either lost or gave up custody of Nova and her older brother that's not shown in this picture. So Nova was living with her great grandparents, was too much for the great grandparents to handle so then she went to the grandma, grandma the baby and she became too much for the grandma so she went back to the mom. At that point Nova was 10 years old. They were living in the hood. Mom was telling Nova all this girl own stuff, essentially telling a 10 year old all her grown people problem. Nova starts running away, starts picking up on the mom's habit if you get what I mean. The mom is kicking her out left and right. One day while Nova's on the street she meets a 32 year old man and you she's like 12 or 13 at this point, man buys a bottle, takes advantage of her and I'm not even bullshitting y'all. She was just casually telling this story on her YouTube channel and she described it as her first real boyfriend, started living with this guy at some point. They were homeless together. The guy was holding her hostage. I mean, it was a whole thing. I started crying when I was watching that video. She said she lied about her age to the guy. This is a picture of her at 13. You can clearly tell that she's 13. Did she still look 13 now? But even after the guy found out her real age, he was still dealing with her. Trigger warning again, this has to do with DV. I'm gonna show you a picture of what the guy did to her. But honestly, I don't find it appropriate. After that guy, she starts dealing with a 17 year old who was abusive. She was saying how he would beat her up and his mom knew and didn't do anything about it until they started getting the police involved. Honestly, it's even worse than what I'm telling you right now. But I'm done with this. Y'all, let me know what y'all think in the comments.

What happened? I woke up during throat surgery when I was 23. They had me knocked out to remove some polyps on my vocal cords, but something went horribly wrong with the anesthesia. When I first opened my eyes, I couldn't move a muscle. I was completely paralyzed from the medicine, but fully conscious. Everything felt muffled at first, like I was underwater. Then I started hearing snippets of conversation. The surgeon was discussing a baseball game with the nurse while he worked on my throat. I tried to scream to let them know I was awake, but my body wouldn't respond. I. I could feel everything. The cold metal of the tools sliding down my throat. The burning sensation as they cut away the growths. The metallic taste of blood pooling at the back of my mouth. But I couldn't even twitch a finger to signal I was conscious. My heart was pounding so hard, I thought it would burst. But the monitors didn't show any change. The paralytic they gave me was working perfectly. Too perfectly. I was trapped in my own body, forced to experience every excruciating second. At one point, the surgeon made a joke about my tattoos. Look at all this ink, he said. Wonder what her parents think. The nurse laughed and said something about kids these days. I wanted to cry, but couldn't even do that. Then things got worse. I felt this sharp, searing pain as something Went wrong. The surgeon swore under his breath. Damn it, we've got a bleeder. My throat was filling with blood faster than they could suction it out. The calm discussion about baseball was replaced with urgent commands. BP is dropping. Get me more suction. Where's that clamp? I. I could feel myself choking, drowning in my own blood, but still couldn't move. That's when the anesthesiologist finally noticed something was off with my readings. He rushed to adjust something in my IV, and everything started fading to black. The last thing I heard was him saying, she's fighting the paralytic. When I woke up in recovery, the nurse asked how I was feeling. I wrote on my notepad. I heard everything. The baseball game, the joke about my tattoos, the bleeding. Her face went white. They pulled my records and discovered my body had metabolized the anesthesia way faster than normal, but the paralytic had stayed at full strength. Apparently, it's a rare genetic condition that runs in my family, something my mom forgot to mention. The hospital tried to sweep it all under the rug. They offered to waive all my medical bills if I sign some papers promising not to sue. But that wasn't what I wanted. I just wanted them to document my case so it wouldn't happen to anyone else. The surgeon and anesthesiologist came to apologize later that day. The surgeon looked like he hadn't slept in days. He kept saying how sorry he was. About the tattoo comments, I wrote back the baseball game was more offensive. Yankees suck. But here's the crazy part. When they checked the surgery recording, apparently they film everything for teaching purposes. They found something disturbing during the bleeding incident.

This way if a police dog smells something unusual, they will only find the dead animal. If you want to get rid of a crime weapon, the best way to do it is to melt it down into a block of steel, then throw it in the ocean. This way it will sink to the bottom and if someone finds it, they will never know what it originally was. If you want to trespass onto someone's property, bring a dog leash with you. If someone asks why you're there, just tell them your dog ran off and you're trying to find it. If your grandmother is racist, create a photo montage of your brother or sister in a situation that will upset her. She will remove them from her will so you will inherit a larger share. To skip class, wait for the break and hide your bag somewhere. Then when you have to go back to class, go to the teacher and explain that your school bag has disappeared and that someone probably took it as a bad joke. Now he will let you look for your things and you can even ask your best friend to accompany you in the search. So tag him in the comments.

Yes, I'm in white people's business, but I found this story rather interesting. I don't know much about Brook Schofield. I don't know why she's famous. I do remember last year she was in some hot water because her old tweets were pulled up. She was saying some out of pocket things about Trayvon Martin. Whatever she kept posting, she was never really canceled. Half of America is racist anyway is what it is. Then she starts dating this guy who has some serious allegations against some PDF file and they get engaged in less than one year. Baby Bang makes a video and was like hey girl, I guess she was trying to give her advice. This guy is probably love bombing you, you should not be engaged to him. She was like, you already racist, you don't want to be an extra weirdo too? And then Brooke responds with I know damn well you're not talking with them. Bangs and listen, here are my thoughts. I can't take either side on this one, but if I have to who I will lead towards Baby Bangs more. Brooke has the obvious and more egregious crime. And although baby bangs is right in this case, the reason why I can't fully side with her is because of the baby bang. There is a baby bangs person on this app? Gave all of y'all a bad rap and I know y'all are not a monolith. I Know, y'all are allies, but y'all are not to be trusted. At the same time, instead of the baby bangs, is there like, a teenage bangs or it's like, it's not so itty bitty, but not so long.

I only found it 18 years later and I feel horrible that I didn't see it because it probably made me look like a jerk and hurt her feelings. 2. She offered to carry my jacket to the next class when I had to stop at the bathroom. Went to the next class and it was placed on the chair next to her and her best friend said, your boyfriend is here. I was young and shy, did nothing, regretted it. She was amazing. I was honestly just happy being her friend. 3, a girl from one of my courses asked me if I wanted to bake cookies with her. Me, a professional dummy, was like, sure, I like cookies. A friend informed me that I had just agreed to a date. The cookies were pretty good. She was even better. 4, she called me and asked why I had never asked her out on a date. She knew I was interested because I had told some friends that I was and they had told her. The reason I hadn't is because her brother and I were friends before I met her. When she called, I told her I'd be thrilled to take her out, but I wanted to make Sure, it was cool with her brother first. He was cool with it and we've been together 18 years now. Dating a friend's sister could have turned out bad, though, to be honest. 5. They waited until they no longer had a crush on me and then told me that they used to have a crush on me. 6, she literally stopped me as I was passing by with my friends and asked me if I remember us looking at each other at McDonald's. 7, when I was in seventh grade, a boy wrote me the sweetest poem. I have it saved somewhere still. I still remember the line, I'll take you to the movies or even to the mall even though I'm short and even though you're tall, Mike. Wherever you are, I hope you're happy and have the best woman ever. 8, I was good friends with my crush. One night while texting, he says, we aren't just friends, right? And that was the first time I realized even he has a thing for me. And I wasn't just imagining the sparks between us. He was my first boyfriend. I don't think I'd have a relationship as healthy as that. 1. 9, woke up to her cuddling with me after a house party. 10, I saw the prophecies in the flames.

When I went to a camp, my mom agreed to take care of my hamster. Hampstey was the best, cuddliest creature and enjoyed playing with me. When I came back, Hampstey was a wild a hole, biting my hand. Because my mom didn't play enough with him, he went feral. Turned out he didn't go feral after all. Our family dog got Hampstey and mom replaced him with identical hamster. 2. That moths were the ghosts of butterflies. Cheers for that one, dad. 3. That people could flush themselves down the toilet. Once when I was four, I had annoyed my mom enough that she said alright, I guess I'm gonna go flush myself. I ran into the bathroom after her only to find the toilet flushing and are gone. She was laughing behind the shower curtain as I cried into the toilet. 4. I grew up believing the President Bush called my dad every day to make sure his watch was set correctly. I told my teacher this face palm. My dad also taught Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan everything they know. 5. My mom and aunt always told each other how handsome I was and that girls would be lining up at the door. 6. While working on the cars or in his workshop, my dad would often initially turn the wrench the wrong way. He would look me in the eye and say, sometimes you have To tighten him up a little before you can loosen him. A few years ago, I said it to one of my own teenage boys while helping with his car. His response was, dad, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. For over 30 years, I hadn't realized my dad was just covering up for the fact that he was turning the wrench the wrong way. 7 my dad told me that when I turned 10, the Gypsies would knock on the door and take me away for a year to teach me about their way of life. I know I was unsure he was telling the truth, but he went so all in on the lie over the months preceding my 10th birthday that I was absolutely terrified every time there was a knock on the door. Eight. That when my aunt went skydiving, she brought me back a piece of a cloud. It was just a cotton ball pulled apart and sitting in a baggie. Nine. When I was about ten, my grandfather took me fishing. Being a ten year old, I caught nothing but weeds. I asked him if we could cook the weeds, which he replied, of course. I go back to their house and watch TV while I wait for my delicious pond weeds. Fast forward five years and I am a high school freshman. One day, the cafeteria served green beans. I thought they were lake weeds. So I bet my friend $10 that They were from a lake. I found out that I didn't eat pond weeds. My grandmother had thrown out the weeds and cooked a can of green beans. I also lost $10. For five years. I thought green beans were actually pond weeds. 10 that it was illegal to turn the lights on inside the car while my parents were driving.

Instead of fairy tales, they read us the instruction manuals for appliances. Nothing like drifting off to sleep with dreams of dishwashers. 2. They asked permission to leave the table after eating. At my house, we just disappeared like ninjas. 3, my friend's dad was a dentist. One day he found crested white strips in her bedroom and he had a total meltdown. He was like, Victoria, what have I told you about what these things will do to your teeth? Where did you get these? Where did you get them? She was like, they're just free samples that came in the mail. I swear I wasn't even going to use them. So that. 4, my friend's parents could afford to fill their fridges but didn't like sharing with kids. Friends. My mom would never fill the fridge, but if I had friends over, she always made sure they were fed with something. 5. They were a living room family. My family was always a stay in your own room or space kind of family. It took some getting used to, but I eventually loved how every activity could somehow involve every person in the house. Sister wants to watch a movie. Dad will make the popcorn. We'll get the blankets. Come on. There's room on the couch for everyone. Mom is going in the backyard to garden. Well, We're all gonna sit outside for the afternoon till dinner when she's done. Their parents became good friends with mine. And now that I'm an adult with my own kiddos, we are also a living room family. My parents and brother will come out of their respective spaces to spend time doing nothing with us. And it's because of my best friend. 6, more than one box of cereal can be open and used at one time. Not like open, open. But in my house, you couldn't break the seal on a new box of cereal without finishing the current box of cereal entirely. At my friend's houses, there was always multiple cereals to choose from for breakfast on any given morning. 7, my friend's families would actually sit down at dinner and have conversations with each other. I was amazed. At my house, my mother would put a meal in front of me at the kitchen table, then take her dinner, go into her bedroom, close the door and eat her dinner while she read a book. I had the dog and the cat for company. My mother never understood why I loved having dinner at my friend's houses. 8, the mom would cook one item for a meal, like green beans. The next day they might have chicken.

Which is also cool, but I'll always miss turning the corner at the grocery store and seeing that spin is doing an all punk issue.

This is mom, 24 year old Akayla Beardon. This is dad, 24 year old Justin Beardon. The two of them lived in Anderson County. Michaela had called emergency services saying that she found her infant daughter covered in blood. When police arrived, they found the daughter infant in her bassinet. She was indeed covered in blood and they also saw that she had bite marks all over her ears, hands, feet, legs, arms. They also found the infant's twin brother in near the same condition. They asked the parents if they had any kind of rat problem or knew of any rat infestation. And to that they both admitted that they do have field rats that get in the house and they've been dealing with that for a very long time. Problem is here is that these bite marks didn't look like they were something that just happened recently. How were these bite marks happening on these children and these parents didn't realise and they didn't realise until they came in and just saw the infant covered in her injuries. There was also the problem that they allowed the children to live there knowing that they were having an infestation problem of these field rat. So these two were arrested but as you can guessed, they are out on bond.

He knew he was shooting blanks, but let me have two procedures under general anesthesia to find out what was wrong with me. His mother ended up mentioning it because she thought for sure he had told me. 2. Finding out my son has a half sister who is just four months younger than he is. 3. Coming home from a trip, my husband picked me up from the airport in my car. I noticed that the back window was cracked open. It was the kind of small triangular window that you have to crack open from the inside manually. I asked him who was sitting in the back seat. Without thinking, he said it was his best friend and the friend's wife. I asked then who was sitting in the front. He laughed nervously and didn't answer. That was how I found out he was having an affair. 4. A couple's therapist saying, I can't do this anymore. You need to divorce him and move on with your life. 5. Our youngest was really ill. I took him to the emergency room three times. My husband complains about the cost each time and gaslighting me that I was overreacting. The third time, I had to carry him into the hospital. And our kid, seven, finally got a chest X ray, and within minutes we were in an ambulance. He had severe pneumonia. Looking back, honestly, he Was actively passing away. So after four IVs, breathing tube, pigtail tube to drain the fluid off his collapsing lung, X ray after X ray, CT scans, he finally turned a corner. But it wasn't a good prognosis. We were lucky. In the meantime, my mother in law came to help with our older child. She proceeded to get absolutely hammered every night she was here. A woman in her 70s, falling down drunk. I was so angry at her selfishness. Also, I missed my own mother's memorial service. Obviously, I had no choice, but it was still a blow. I wanted to be able to remember her with her sisters, see her face and hear her voice in them. Instead, I listened in on speaker from far away. This was on day 12 of my youngest being hospitalized, and we were waiting to be discharged. I was emotionally, physically, and mentally exhausted, and I just wanted to get my son home. As we are waiting for an available doctor to discharge us, my husband called and asked if he needed to be there for his child. That barely pulled through. On the day of my mother's memorial service. While his mother was there, making everything harder. That he even asked that question galled me. It took me three trips to the car by myself. Since after that long, we had clothes and toiletries, blankets and stuffies, puzzles, games, books, etc. I couldn't look at my husband the same after That

And so at night time, she would sneak on the computer and she would seek out life experiences and information that she was missing at home. This is also when she would sneak sweets and food that she wasn't allowed to have via oral route when her mother was awake. This is also how she ended up meeting her boyfriend. And believe it or not, it was through a Christian dating site. Now, these two men on a Christian dating site in 2012, Late at night, they would convene with their late night talks. That got really racy, by the way. The two conjured up a plan to finally meet. Gypsy got her mom to take her to a movie theater. And he was supposed to show up and just kind of bump into them. And make a good impression on the mom. It didn't really happen. They didn't get to sit together in the movie theater. But Gypsy snuck off to the bathroom and so did he. And this is when they had their first actual encounter. Again, when they were leaving the theater, he tried to impress the mom, who was only more turned off by him. And the two knew that they were not gonna be able to spend Time together in front of Gypsy's mom. So they continued their late night chats. And through these late night chats, it would come up how Gypsy felt like she was kind of just trapped. Nick wanted to help her get out. So he comes up with this plan of unaliving Deedee. Now, ultimately, Nick made it look like it was a break in. And he ended up stabbing Deedee multiple, multiple time in her bed as she lays sleeping. Now, Nick

Unfortunately, it seems as though there was a serious scheduling mishap and she's not the one who schedules the appointments. So all I can do now is the owner is apologize and ask, how do I fix this for you? I can't walk around quite literally missing half of my hair, otherwise I would look like I had a mullet. So you might as well finish what you've started. Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and take over from here. Um, can you grab the receptionist and tell her I need to speak to her when I'm done? Yeah, sure thing. Alright, ma'am, while I understand that this is nowhere near what you are wanting done today, um, how's it looking for what it is, it'll have to do trust and believe. I will be posting all over social media what has happened here today and I understand that it wasn't you or that stylist fault, but someone who works here messed up big time and a matter of fact, I'm not paying. I don't think I should have to. I have no qualms with that and I for once completely understand. Have a good day.

David, you haven't come to the bar all night. How would you know if I needed help or not? Sweetheart, I'm the only manager on shift tonight. I have a million things going on. If you need help, I'm here to help now. No, actually, I'm fine. I did wanna talk to you though. I have a few ideas of what we could change around here. Okay. I mean, I think we should focus on finishing out the night and then I would be happy to hear your ideas. David, I only have four customers right now and they're fine. So first of all, I don't think we need a bar server anymore for the high top tables. She was stepping on my toes all night. She was very rude and I can handle those tables on my own. It's not a big deal, baby. I don't think that's a good idea. It's very difficult to manage an entire bar and 6 high top tables, especially when it gets busy in here. Maybe for one of the bartenders that you picked up off the street, but for someone who has experience, it's not that hard. Okay, well, maybe that's something that we'll revisit in like two or three months when you've kind of got the hang of everything again. David, I don't know where you got this idea that I'm struggling, but I'm fine. Okay, next, I think we should get All different beers. These beers are disgusting. Well, our beers are our biggest money maker. So what would you suggest we replace them with?

I cannot believe you would send my order like this after I explicitly told you not to. Is this Jim? Yes, I just waited almost 30 minutes for an incorrect order to show up at my house. See, this is why you guys work in restaurants because you can't follow simple instructions. Jim, if you want to talk about following instructions, the only reason why this whole thing is happening is because you selected the wrong item on Doordash so you wouldn't have to pay the difference. That's not true. It was a mistake. Okay, well, that's fine. I told you that you could reorder if you wanted to, but we can't give you something that you didn't pay for. Let me talk to a manager right now. Well, unfortunately, our manager is gone for the night, but what can I help you with? Oh my God, this is fucking useless. I've been treated like absolute shit by this company and I want a full refund, right? Okay, well, since you ordered through Doordash, all returns will have to be processed through them. No, you know what? I'm sick of this bullshit. I'm not getting off the phone until I get a refund. Okay, well, again, we can't process your refund, but I will say you got the items you paid for. We deliver them in a timely manner. So I don't know if that's gonna work out for you. Oh, well, I don't Give a fuck what you think. You're obviously not the manager. You're not gonna be issuing my refund. So if you could please transfer me to someone who could, that would be great. Uh hmm. The Doordash app can issue your refund. No, I wanna be done with this stupid mess. I just want my refund now. Okay. Well, even if we were gonna offer you a refund, all of our payment is done through Doordash. So unfortunately, we cannot process a refund for you. Oh, yeah, well, you better figure it out because like I said, I'm not getting off this phone until I have a refund. Okay, I understand.

Um, so what is it about them that you have a problem with? Are you joking? Are you. No, I'm just surprised you haven't gotten any more complaints about them. First of all, they look like drag Queens. The hair done up, the makeup done up, the cleavage. Okay, I'm not done. They're basically half naked in here and I'm not bringing my husband in for his birthday for a reservation we've had for two weeks when all he's gonna do is get distracted by girls that can't put it away. Okay, ma'am, with all due respect, this sounds more like a personal issue. The fuck do you mean personal issue? This wouldn't be an issue at all if your employees weren't throwing their boobs around. And how does one exactly throw their boob around? You know what I mean? Listen, this might get you sales with the men, but I think it's a disgusting business practice.

Alright. Okay. So before I go get your color mixed up, do you want any coffee, water or wine? No, Siri and I thought that we discussed. Don't worry, Rebecca, I didn't forget. Drinks is just a new addition to our salon. So it's something that I have to ask, but I won't ask again. Oh, okay. Well, if you must. So has it been a busy Friday? I know in any industry it's busy on Fridays. Hmm. Today's been pretty lackluster. I really like the use of that word. Thank you. I appreciate it. Okay, stop. Have I done something like, you're normally talking my ear off? What? No, Rebecca, the past few times that you've been here, you told me that you don't like pleasantries, that you don't like whenever I narrate whatever I'm about to do next. Um, that you don't wanna switch things up. You're a big girl. You would tell me otherwise. So I'm just trying to make today go as quickly as possible and as quietly as possible so we can get you out of here. I didn't wanna make you any more uncomfortable than I have.

Wasn't expecting to see all this here today. Oh, um, thank you. They let you come to work with all this on? What do you mean? It's just a lot to be looking at at 11:00am, don't you think? I mean, the hair, the makeup, the cleavage. Oh, um, well, I mean, our boss generally prefers us to wear makeup, and this is our uniform, so I can't really do anything about it. Okay, well, this is a family friendly establishment. I mean, tone it down a little bit. Well, I don't really know what you want me to do. I'm not really wearing that much makeup. This is my uniform, so I just don't really feel comfortable bringing my husband in here anymore. Why? Well, I'm just not too eager to bring him into a place with a bunch of girls looking like strippers. Okay, you don't have to eat here. Well, no, we've had this reservation for, like, two weeks. It's his birthday. Okay, you can eat here if you want to. Well, you're just making me uncomfortable. I mean, look at you. You're too kind. But if you have a problem with our uniforms or our dress code or how we present ourselves, you can take it up with our managers, because they're the ones who made the uniforms. They wrote the dress code. It's not really our decision. Well, can you at least cover up for today so my husband doesn't get distracted on His birthday? Yeah. Like I said, you can take that up with our manager. Do you want me to go get him? God, I can't even look at you. Yeah, go get your manager.

Well, precious doesn't need any training, because just him being here makes my anxiety go away. Okay, so let me get this straight. This 5 pound dog who has been whining in your face for the past 10 minutes and looks like he's about to shit in your hand, he relieves your anxiety? Yeah, and the only reason he's whining, by the way, is because he hasn't had his 11:45 snack yet. And whose fault is that? Um, it's not mine. I don't think I've ever met a dog who needs an 11:00am snack either. It is yours, actually, if we hadn't been having this conversation for the past 15 minutes, precious could be halfway through his meal right now. Okay, well, as much as I hate to deny precious his 11 45 am snack, unfortunately, we still can't have you sit inside. So we can get you at a spot on the patio, or you can come back at a different time without precious. Okay, you know what? This is obviously going nowhere, so fine, I'll drop precious off and I'll come back. But can you at least reserve a table for me? Yes, we can.

You know, we could sue you guys for discrimination. No, actually, you can't. There's no law protecting E s a s in restaurants. It's just service animals. Believe you, you're just trying to discriminate against me because I have a mental health condition. Ma'am, I could care less about what conditions you have, but it's just our policy. We don't allow dogs inside inches away from where people are eating. Well, that's ridiculous. My dog has severe separation anxiety. I can't just leave him at home. Huh? I thought he was the one that was supposed to be supporting you. We support each other. Okay, now, if you're not gonna let us eat here, we are gonna give you a scathing Yelp review. Oh, no, please don't. Well, people deserve to know that this is not a dog friendly establishment, ma'am. You can have your dog. You just have to sit on the patio for the last time. We are not sitting on the patio. Precious does not do well under 70 degrees. Okay, then please tell me what you would like me to do. Well, can't you just make an exception? Well, that's kind of out of my control. It's just our policy. If you want, you can talk to a manager. Yes, actually, I would love that. I'm sure he would love to hear about the discrimination that I'm experiencing right now.

How much more? About 3, 80 and that's only if I don't have to use extra colour. Otherwise I have to charge more additional colour why? I'm only getting a root retouch. One bowl isn't enough. We have a specific amount that we are allotted per one bowl of color and if I go over that it is an additional bowl and I will have to charge you. I'm sure you're very talented. Uh, but almost $400 for a root retouch and a haircut is uh, and I like to tip people. I can't afford you or you plus a tip. So I don't know what to do. Unfortunately, those are my prices and they are firm. So I'm sorry for wasting your time. Why can't she do my hair? Clearly she's here. Hi. What seems to be going on here? Sorry, I'm the manager. I was up front and couldn't help but to overhear. Is there anything I can help with? Maybe you can help me understand why I was moved from the person who I was booked with that I can afford and instead placed with someone who's almost twice as much and the best you can offer me is sorry for wasting my time. I, why wasn't I told also? Cause clearly Siri's here.
