And it's the battle of the sisters. Jessica Simpson is killing this look. It's been a long time since we've seen her at award shows and on a red carpet. Obviously, she has new music coming out. I love everything about this. Ashley Simpson is also there, and while she looks beautiful, I feel like this is her go to style, and I wish she'd change it up. We saw alandria. I was wondering if Nick was there, too, and he was, and I have to give it to him, this look eats. Speaking of sisters, we have Paris and Nicki Hilton, and my god, could they not have been more opposite? Paris is lit up on fire, and I feel like this is really fun. Nicki opted for a softer look, and I think it's really pretty, but it's the Vmas, and I need fun. Like, this is what I'm talking about. Is he wearing a see through top? Is it just a scarf? That looks like it's an open button shirt? I don't know, but I love it. And it's Lenny Kravitz. He can do no wrong. Britney Snow, absolutely gorgeous. She's giving old Hollywood glam. I love it from head to toe. Rebecca Black is definitely giving fun. I just don't really know what's happening here. This reminds me of the tablecloth that my mom used to have on her dining room table. And up here, I don't know, is That mold. Chance the rapper is also in attendance, I just feel like this is an outfit he'd probably wear any other day, and I would have liked to see more.

But her face immediately dropped when she realised that we tricked her. My sister in law, Maya, has always been competitive with me since the day I married her brother, Jake. She couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, I tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me. And from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd discuss, she'd push harder. Come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nurse free and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail when she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages desperately searching for any Evidence of our name decision, my husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use first. She wouldn't do that, he said, but I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created blank interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with Final Decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition and I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think, she'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived. The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to her Surprise. The next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness when I walked into her room. She actually had the audacity to say, I hope you don't mind that we ended up using Aurora when she was born. It just felt so right for our daughter. I know you guys were considering it, too. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed her our real pic.

We had the weirdest rule in probably the entire state. No closed doors while changing clothes, ever. Not my bedroom door, not the bathroom, not even the closet. Teenagers hide tattoos all over their body if we let them, dad would say, or they could be hiding pills in their pockets. My friends were horrified when they heard about it. Mickey came over once and watched me change from school clothes to normal one and right in the middle of our living room while dad sat there with his newspaper glancing up every few seconds. That's so creepy, she whispered. And I wanted to disappear. My older brother had already escaped to college partly because of rules like this. I counted days until I could leave, too. Mom tried to help without directly challenging dad. She couldn't change his mind about the rule, but she found ways around it. The shower has frosted glass. I mentioned one day while folding towels, you're only visible as a shadow. She also helped me rearrange my room, putting my full length mirror at an angle where it looked like you could see everything from the doorway, but there was actually a blind spot. Perfect for 30 second wardrobe changes. I got really good at it too. I kept spare clothes in the bathroom and changed when dad was busy watching TV. Mom would create distractions, calling dad to fix something right when I needed to change for school. For weeks, this worked perfectly. Dad thought he was enforcing his rules since door stayed open. He even bragged to his co workers about how his visibility system kept me safe. But then one weekend, everything exploded in ways I never imagined. Dad's colleague Rob came by to drop off work files. Dad was on a video call in his office. Mom was grocery shopping. And I just gotten home from track with my entire body sweating. I couldn't wait for Dad's call to end. So I ducked behind my mirror blind spot like always. But Rob didn't know our house layout. He was looking for Dad's office and saw what looked completely wrong from his angle, a teenage girl while hiding behind furniture to undress. He looked away immediately but asked me a question that sounded oddly serious. Where's your father? I pointed to Dad's office and he took off through the door. I heard him say, Jim, your daughter was hiding behind furniture to change clothes. Combined with these visibility rules you mentioned, dad came out confused at first. She knows the rules about doors. Rob shook his head. Jim, she was hiding behind furniture to change. That is not okay. You're making her feel unsafe the way.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We've known each other since freshman year. And when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything, 50, 50, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird serious face he starts with. So I've been thinking and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. She's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue because honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I Tell her fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realise I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says, okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the t V and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realised she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that.

So I snapped. What I discovered when I got there made me realize I'd raised a monster and I had to choose between my son and doing what was right. When my daughter in law, Emma called asking me to visit, I could hear something was wrong. She just had the baby three weeks ago, but her voice sounded hollow, defeated. I just, I need help, she whispered into the phone. But don't tell Kevin I called you. Red flag No. 1. Why couldn't she tell my son she needed support? I drove the four hours to their house. Immediately Kevin answered the door looking well rested, freshly showered, wearing clean clothes. Mom, what are you doing here? Emma called, I said, pushing past him. Where is she? I found Emma in the nursery, still in the same pajamas she'd probably worn for days. The baby was screaming. Emma was crying. The house was a disaster. Honey, when's the last time you slept, I asked. I don't know, she said, bouncing the baby mechanically. Tuesday, what day is it now? It was Friday. Kevin walked in, eating a sandwich. She's been a little emotional lately, he said casually. Hormones, you know? I looked at my son, my son who I'd raised to respect women and felt sick. When's the last time you held your daughter, I asked him. I held her yesterday, he said defensively, for like 20 minutes while Emma showered. 20? Minutes in a week. Your wife just had major surgery. She needs help. I work all day, he said. I'm tired, too. Emma was back at work. No, turns out Kevin meant his part time job at his buddies auto shop. Three days a week, four hours each. Meanwhile, Emma was up every two hours feeding the baby, doing all the night wakeings, plus somehow managing to keep the house from completely falling apart. I told her she could sleep when the baby sleeps, Kevin said, like he'd solve the problem, but she always finds something to clean instead. I watched Emma flinch at this like she was afraid to rest. That's when I realised what was really happening here. Emma, show me your phone, I said gently. She hesitated, glancing at Kevin nervously. It's okay, I said. Just show me. Her text messages with Kevin were.

My eight year old grandson asked if he could say Grace. As we bowed our heads, he said, god is good, god is great. Thank you for the food, and I would thank you even more if Grandpa gets us ice cream for dessert. And liberty and justice for all. Amen. Along with the laughter from the other customers nearby, I heard a woman remark, that's what's wrong with parenting these days. Kids today don't even know how to pray. Asking god for ice cream, why I never? Hearing this, my grandson burst into tears and asked me, did I do it wrong? Is god mad at me? So, after I assured him that he had done a terrific job and that god was certainly not mad at him, an elderly gentleman approached the table. He winked at my grandson and said, I happen to know that god thought that was a great prayer. Really? My grandson asked, cross my heart, the man replied. Then in a theatrical whisper, he added, indicating the woman whose remark had started this whole thing, too bad she never asks god for ice cream. A little ice cream is sometimes good for the soul. Naturally, I bought my grandchildren ice cream. At the end of the meal, my grandson stared at his ice cream for a moment, and then he did something I will remember the rest of my life. He picked up his sundae. And without a word walked over and placed it in front of the woman. With a big smile he told her here, this is for you. Shove it up your ass, you grouchy old bitch

When my little sister Lena got diagnosed with Ms, she didn't cry. She just looked at me and said, I guess I won't beat you in races anymore. She said it with a smile. Can you imagine a 12 year old girl knowing her body is betraying her and still trying to make me feel better? So naturally I became her personal security guard, walking her to school, carrying her books, telling her dumb jokes to make her laugh on hard days. But I wasn't ready for Jason. Jason was the kind of teenage parasite that grows in a locker room and feeds off axe body spray and misplaced confidence. Captain of the basketball team, hair like a shampoo commercial, rain like overcooked broccoli. I was walking Lena to class one day when she dropped her books. Her hands were shaking. Ms does that. Before I could help, Jason and his buddies walked by laughing. He pulled out his phone and said loud enough for everyone to hear, dude, is she glitching? Someone reboot her. I froze. Lena turned bright red and then Jason topped it off by uploading it to his story with the caption error 4:04, dignity not found. The school took it down too late. The damage was done. Lena didn't talk for 3 days. I didn't sleep for 7. See there this thing people don't understand about revenge. It's not about Anger. It's about patience. And I've got the patience of a monk who's just been ghosted. Step 1, confusion. I got access to Jason's locker. Don't ask how. Let, let's just say the janitor smokes menthols and owes me a favor. Every couple of days. I moved things around, switched his notebooks, swapped one shoe for a size smaller, took out his lunch and replaced it with tuna that had been sitting in my garage for a week. He thought he had early onset dementia. I just smiled when he walked by muttering, I swear I packed my red folder. Step 2, sabotage. Jason took ADH meds. Nothing crazy, just enough to keep him focused. I swapped them with over the counter melatonin. Suddenly he was nodding off in history like a narcotic cat that teachers noticed. They didn't think drugs. They thought he was lazy. His grades dropped. College scouts stopped calling. Shame. Step 3, psychological erosion. Jason lived with his grandma because both his parents peaced out when he was in middle school. She was sweet, the kind of grandma who knits ugly sweaters and gives you those hard candies no one actually buys. I ran into her at the pharmacy, helped her carry her bags, complimented her ugly sweater. She called me a nice young man. I called her Nana. Boom, Instant trust. Then I planted the seed. Jason's been acting a little off lately, huh? Talking to himself a lot. She nodded slowly and said, I've Noticed that, too. She took him to a doctor. The DOC upped his meds. I kept swapping them. The result, he started hearing things, whispering, humming. At one point, he said the school lockers were laughing at him. He punched one, broke his wrist, cried in the nurse's office. Step 4, identity removal. I hacked into a student portal, changed small things, wrong birthday, switched his emergency contact from his grandma to a number I bought at a gas station. Then I forged a school psych report stating Jason might be suffering from dissociation. Next thing you know, Jason gets pulled from class and is forced into a mental health evaluation. He passed barely, but now every teacher looked at him like he was a ticking time bomb. In the final nail, I broke into his room while he was out, moved furniture around, rotated his posters, replaced a photo of him and his grandma with a nearly identical one, but with slightly different outfits. It drove him insane. He screamed at her one night that she was in on it. She cried. He got sent to a psych ward for evaluation. He didn't come back. A week later, his grandma bumped into me outside a grocery store, said Jason wasn't himself anymore. I said, maybe he never was. She just nodded, sighed, and handed me a bag of those disgusting candies. Oh, and Lena, she started smiling again, drawing again, talking again. As for Jason, he went from being The king of the school to being a ghost in a hospital gown who doesn't know if the voices in his head are real. And the best part, he still doesn't know who did it. He just knows someone did that. Paranoia, it'll live rent free in his head until the day he dies. And me, I sleep just fine. After all, some glitches can't be fixed.

My brother is married to Haley and they're expecting a baby together. Last year, I officially changed my first name from Evelyn to indie, which was a nickname form of my original middle name. My parents gave in after realising how serious I was about being indie and how I was not warming up to or growing into Evelyn. My brother and Haley want an older vintage name for their baby. And Haley asked me about five months ago why I disliked Evelyn enough to change it. At the time, she brought up how popular the name has become and how vintage is back. I told her I didn't like vintage names me. They sound really old fashioned. I said the popularity didn't influence my decision. She wanted to know my reason for disliking older names and why I liked something like indie instead. I didn't mind her asking the first time. She brought it up again a week later and asked the same question, pressing more about why. She asked a third and a fourth time. I gave her the same answer and asked her why she kept asking. I told her my answer wasn't going to change. By the seventh time she asked, she admitted she was worried her baby would hate having an older name and wanted to figure out what she could do to prevent what happened with me happening To her, she also said she'd like me to rethink my name because she thought Evelyn was beautiful and she was sad I had chosen something like indie over it. I asked her to stop so many times already and I even asked my brother to step in. He told me I needed to understand it was the hormones. I can easily say she has asked me this more than 25 times by now. I'm not exaggerating that number either. Two weeks ago when she brought it up again, she said she felt I had made a mistake changing my name and that 30 year old me wouldn't be so against Evelyn. I told her 30 year old me can deal with it if that happens. She told me I didn't really have a good reason to like the name indie and that it seems like the kind of name someone young likes but not someone older. Then yesterday happened and I kind of lost my temper. She started asking the same stuff again and the baby is almost ready to be born, so I know it's coming to an end. But she asked me to really think about why and help her because she couldn't figure out what she'd do differently than my parents did. Then she said they really shouldn't have let me change my name so young. I snapped. I told her to stop asking me the same question because my answer won't change. And her comments Are not going to change my mind. I said I don't like old fashioned names. I think they're awful and I'm sick and tired of hearing how much better they supposedly are and having her try to make me find a reason she finds acceptable. I told her just like she hates indie, I hate Evelyn and she needs to let it fucking go already. She burst into tears and my brother got so mad at me. My parents were also like, why did you have to speak to her so harshly?

I've got 5 kids. This is about three of them. Casey, Alex, and Tom. Casey, my 26 year old daughter, is getting married this winter. She's been with her fiance, Max, for about four years now. He's from another country, and with the currency difference, his family can't really afford to contribute to the wedding and also afford the travel costs. So I offered to cover the majority of the wedding expenses. No problem. She's my little girl. I've always dreamed of walking her down the aisle. It was supposed to be one of those proud, emotional dad moments you never forget. Then last week, two of my kids, Alex and Tom, came over with their families. We were catching up, talking about life, and naturally, the wedding came up. I casually asked if they were excited, thinking we'd all be there together for the big day. That's when they both got quiet. They hadn't been invited. At first, I figured maybe Casey hadn't sent out all the invitations yet. Maybe it was some mailing mix up. But then my oldest daughter, who's also there, said she had received her invite already. Same with my youngest, and both of them had been invited with their partners and their kids. So I called my sister to check, and yep, she and her whole family had been invited weeks ago. That's when I Knew this wasn't some oversight. Casey had specifically left Alex and Tom out. Now, here's what makes this even more painful. Alex is non binary and married to a man. Tom is gay, also married with adopted children. And Casey has always been supportive. She stood by them when they came out. She used to call herself their fiercest defender. We're not some rigid, divided family. We're close. Or at least we used to be. So I called her and I asked her why, Max's family isn't comfortable with non traditional couples. It's against their culture. And she hopes I'll understand. Understand? No. Absolutely not. I told her straight up, if she's okay excluding her own brothers, who've done nothing wrong, just to make her fiance's family more comfortable, then I'm not walking her down the aisle. I'm not paying for the wedding either. Let Max's family, with all their backward opinions, pay for it. I told her, if your family suddenly doesn't fit into your picture perfect day, then maybe we're not part of that picture at all. Called me an asshole and hung up crying. My other kids are all on my side. Even my wife, who usually tries to stay neutral, was heartbroken. She adores our son's in law. Loves those kids like they're her own grandkids. She doesn't support Casey's decision at all, even if she's trying to stay open. In case our daughter eventually wakes up and realizes how messed up this Is. But as of now, I'm not budging. I'm not rewarding exclusion and cowardice, and I sure as hell won't smile in a tux pretending it's all okay.

We'll make your sister pay. She'll never say no to family. I froze with the grocery bags in my hands. Through the kitchen window, I could see them all sitting around the table, Mom, Dad and my brother Landon. Harper's got that new job, dad was saying, making good money now. We'll just tell her it's for Mom's surgery. Mom nodded. She gave us 12,000 for the roof last year, no questions asked. Stomach dropped. There was no roof repair. I'd seen the receipts myself. They'd used my money for Landon's gambling debts. How much this time, mom asked. 50,000, Landon said casually, maybe 60 if we play it right. Tell her the cancer came back. Cancer. They were going to fake cancer to steal from me. I backed away slowly, my mind racing. The cancer scare from two years ago, the one that made me liquidate my retirement fund to pay for experimental treatments. Had that been fake 2, I thought about all the times I'd help. The car accident that wasn't covered by insurance, Landon's business that needed startup capital, Mom's dental work, Dad's back surgery. 3, $57,000 over five years, all because I thought I was being a good daughter. Every family gathering they raised me for being so generous. Behind my back, they were laughing at how easy I was to manipulate. I got in my Car and drove straight to the bank. I'd like to close all my accounts, I told the teller. All of them, miss every single one. And I need cashiers checks for the full amounts, documentation of every transaction I've made to these three people over the past five years. That evening, Landon called right on schedule. Hey, sis, can you come over tomorrow? Mom has some news about her health. His voice had that practiced concern, the same tone he'd used for every fake emergency. Sure, I said sweetly. I'll bring the whole family something special. I spent that night making copies of everything, bank statements, medical records I'd helped to pay for, receipts from Landon's failed ventures, five years of financial manipulation, all documented. The next day I walked into the.

I politely told him I had an important interview and couldn't give up my seat. His face turned red. Do you know who I am? I fly first class every week.

What happened? I woke up during throat surgery when I was 23. They had me knocked out to remove some polyps on my vocal cords, but something went horribly wrong with the anesthesia. When I first opened my eyes, I couldn't move a muscle. I was completely paralyzed from the medicine, but fully conscious. Everything felt muffled at first, like I was underwater. Then I started hearing snippets of conversation. The surgeon was discussing a baseball game with the nurse while he worked on my throat. I tried to scream to let them know I was awake, but my body wouldn't respond. I, I could feel everything, the cold metal of the tools sliding down my throat, the burning sensation as they cut away the growths, the metallic taste of blood pooling at the back of my mouth. But I couldn't even twitch a finger to signal I was conscious. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it would burst. But the monitors didn't show any change. The paralytic they gave me was working perfectly, too perfectly. I, I was trapped in my own body, forced to experience every excruciating second. At one point, the surgeon made a joke about my tattoos. Look at all this ink, he said. Wonder what her parents think? The nurse laughed and said something about kids these days. I wanted to cry but couldn't even do that. Then things got worse. I felt this sharp, searing pain as Something went wrong. The surgeon swore under his breath, damn it, we've got a bleeder. My throat was filling with blood faster than they could suction it out. The calm discussion about baseball was replaced with urgent commands. BP is dropping. Get me more suction. Where's that clamp? I. I could feel myself choking, drowning in my own blood, but still couldn't move. That's when the anaesthesiologist finally noticed something was off with my readings. He rushed to adjust something in my IV and everything started fading to black. The last thing I heard was him saying, she's fighting the paralytic. When I woke up in recovery, the nurse asked how I was feeling. I wrote on my notepad. I heard everything, the baseball game, the joke about my tattoos, the bleeding. Her face went white. They pulled my records and discovered my body had metabolized the anesthesia way faster than normal, but the paralytic had stayed at full strength. Apparently, it's a rare genetic condition that runs in my family, something my mom forgot to mention. The hospital tried to sweep it all under the rug. They offered to waive all my medical bills if I sign some papers promising not to sue. But that wasn't what I wanted. I just wanted them to document my case so it wouldn't happen to anyone else. The surgeon and anesthesiologist came to apologize later that day. The surgeon looked like he hadn't slept in days. He kept saying how sorry he. Was about the tattoo comments. I wrote back, the baseball game was more offensive. Yankees suck. But here's the crazy part. When they checked the surgery recording, apparently they film everything for teaching purposes. They found something disturbing during the bleeding incident.

Jess came over to my place Friday night and I could tell something was bothering her by the way she kept sighing. You know what Britney told me today? She said, flopping down on my couch. Her boyfriend is so mysterious and she's obsessed with him. Meanwhile, you texted me 12 times about being nervous for your presentation. The way she said it made me feel like I was some kind of burden. I wish you were more mysterious, more of a challenge. Should have known this would end badly when three weeks later she'd be crying at my door. But that night, I just felt hurt and said, fine, I'll be mysterious that night. I usually would have texted her good night, but I didn't and it felt wrong not doing it. She sent me three question marks right away and I just wrote back, all good and left it at that. Saturday morning came and normally I'd text her about my coffee and ask what she was up to, but I kept my phone in my pocket. Noon she was texting you okay and I just sent a thumbs up, which killed me because I actually wanted to talk to her. Monday was the worst because I got the promotion I've been working for and all I wanted was to call her and celebrate. When we went to dinner that night, she Asked about my day and I just said same old while scrolling through my phone, even though inside I was bursting to tell her. She leaned across the table trying to figure out what was going on with me. You seem different, she said. Good, different. And the crazy part was she seemed more into me than she had in months, which made me feel powerful but also completely hollow inside. The second week, she started showing up at my place without calling first and cooking these fancy dinners, basically doing anything to crack me open. I can't figure you out anymore, she said. Wednesday night and she sounded excited about it. Britney so jealous, she says. I got the mysterious boyfriend Jackpot. I wanted to tell her how dumb this whole thing was and how much I missed just talking to her normally, but I just shrugged and kept watching TV. my dad called because my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery and he was freaking out. I spent three hours calming him down while Jess sat next to me trying to figure out what was happening. After I hung up, she asked, is everything okay? And I wanted to fall into her arms and tell her everything, family, stuff. I said instead, it's handle. She kissed me harder than she had in months and whispered, you're so strong. But I wasn't strong at all. I was just pretending. The third, Thursday night at eleven PM Jess showed up at my door with her makeup running down her face, shaking.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years, and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or asked if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend, she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler, who said she was being a total bitch. I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my Fitness Pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee with Extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. I noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better, and she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

Is Daisy Williams present in school today? My teacher, Missus Harra, clicked the intercom button. Yes. The principal's voice echoed, lockdown, now! This is not a drill. The way he said it made my blood freeze. Missus Harra shrieked under the desks. Lights off! Move, move, move! Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. I couldn't help but think he was after me. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Missus Harra tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. Screaming got louder, and it wasn't just one voice anymore. Multiple people in different parts of the building. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that the shooter was right outside. And I believed them. Pia grabbed my hand, and her palms were soaked with sweat. I could see Mister Kids class across the hall through our door window. Lights already off. No movement. Just darkness. Where 20 kids should have been. I looked at our teacher, and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids, and told us it would be okay. But after a while, she Got up again and walked back to her laptop. Then we heard it. Footsteps running past our door. Thud! Thud, thud! I couldn't help myself. I had to look. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall, pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops. Get away from the door, Daisy! Missus Harra whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Even missus Harra stood up slowly and crept to the door to check the window before opening it. That's when it flung open. The principal stood there with an actual cop who had his hand resting on his gun. You, Daisy, come with us. Immediately my worst fear confirmed. The tutor had sent them. Or maybe they thought I was involved somehow. Missus Harra looked between them and me, confused. Get your things, honey, missus Harra said. And that scared me more than anything, because in three years of chemistry class, she'd never called me honey. Every single person. And was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack with shaking hands. The hallway was complete chaos, more cops than I'd ever seen. In one place, I heard a paramedic shout, we're losing him! Move! As he flew past us. My classmates were pressed against the door windows in every room, watching me get escorted by police like I was a criminal. They steered me to the main office, but passed reception into The conference room. The cop finally spoke. Your dad is here? Well, my parents are divorced, and I hadn't seen him since I was seven. So now I was really confused. Used dad. He grabbed me in a hug so tight I couldn't breathe. And his whole body shook against mine. I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. My ex marine father, who always encouraged me to be stoic and suppress my feelings, was crying his eyes out. Sorry for what? What's happening? Is there a shooter? Are people dead? I pulled back to look at him, and he held my face in both hands. His hands were freezing. There's no

Now my he wants my house. When I was 16, my gaming obsessed brother Tyler convinced my parents I was taking up too much space in our cramped three bedroom apartment. He'd been complaining for months that he needed my room for his elaborate gaming setup. My parents sat me down one evening and basically said I had two weeks to find alternative living arrangements. The reasoning? I was almost 17, practically an adult, and Tyler needed space to pursue his passion in gaming streaming. They genuinely believed he was going to become the next big Twitch star. I was devastated, but had nowhere to go. My girlfriend Emma's parents noticed I've been spending more time at their house and eventually asked what was going on. When I explained the situation, her mom immediately said I could stay with them as long as I needed, no questions asked. Emma and I got serious fast. Living under the same roof will do that to a relationship. When we turned 19, I proposed with a ring. I'd saved six months for working overtime every weekend. Her parents were thrilled. They basically raised me for two years anyway and considered me their son. At 23, we finally had enough saved for a down payment on a small two bedroom house. Nothing fancy. We spent every weekend renovating, learning YouTube tutorials, making mistakes and fixing them. Meanwhile, Tyler was still living with my parents in his gaming paradise. He Dropped out of community college after one semester, claiming his streaming career was about to take off. College was just holding him back. Three years later, he was still grinding away at maybe five viewers on a good day. Sleeping until two PM, gaming until 4:00am, ordering Doordash with my parents money. My parents occasionally texted generic holiday messages or shared Facebook posts about family, but otherwise we had zero relationship. Last month, my mom showed up at my house completely unannounced. I hadn't seen her.

When I tried to correct my stepdaughter, I just smiled and said, alright. I'm Brandon, 38 and married to Samantha for three years. She has twin 12 year olds from her first marriage, Charlotte and Aiden. Their dad sends birthday cards twice a year if we're lucky. Last Tuesday, I caught Charlotte stealing 20 bucks from Samantha's purse. When I confronted her, she rolled her eyes and said, you're not my real dad. You can't tell me what to do. I calmly told Samantha what happened. Instead of addressing the theft, she but defensive, don't lecture my kids about money. If you want a parent so badly, get your own children. That's dumb. But I just smiled and said, alright. See, what Samantha didn't know was that I've been covering their car insurance, phone bills, and school supplies for months while she struggled with debt. I'd also been quietly setting aside college funds for both kids, $400 a month each into savings accounts they didn't even know existed. The next morning, I cancelled everything. Car insurance gone, phone plan terminated, the college accounts I'd opened, closed, and transferred to my personal savings. I also stopped buying groceries. No more weekly 200 dollar trips to keep the pantry stocked. No more paying for their Netflix, Spotify, or Charlotte's dance classes that cost me $150 a month. Aiden's soccer registration fees not my problem anymore. I even cancelled the family gym membership and Stopped paying for their school lunches. Every subscription, every monthly payment, every little expense I've been quietly handling. All of it gone. When Charlotte's phone got shut off at school and she couldn't call her friends, she came home furious. Why isn't my phone working? Ask your mom, I said, not looking up from my laptop. Aiden couldn't get picked up from soccer practice because as the car insurance had lapsed and Samantha's registration was expired, she had to leave work early, costing her overtime pay she desperately needed. That evening, Samantha panicked when she opened the fridge to find it nearly empty. The pantry was bare except for some stale crackers and a can of beans. Where's all the food? What happened to everything? She demanded, hands shaking as she looked at the empty shelves. I shrugged. You said get my own kids, so I'm focusing on the children who'll actually be mine someday. These aren't my responsibility anymore. You made that crystal clear. But, Brandon, I didn't mean. You absolutely meant it, I interrupted. Charlotte stole from you, and instead of parenting her, you attacked me for caring. So I'm done caring. The look on her face was priceless. Pure panic mixed with the dawning realization of just how much I've been carrying financially. Charlotte stormed into the kitchen. This is so unfair! You can't just stop paying for stuff! Watch me, I said calmly. Your mom made it clear you're not my kids, so figure it out! Yourselves. Over the next week, reality hit them like a freight train. Samantha's paycheck couldn't stretch to cover what I've been handling. Charlotte's dance recital got cancelled because the payment bounced. Aiden's soccer gear stayed dirty because no one had money for the laundromat. The twins started fighting, constantly stressed about their phones being dead and their friends asking why they couldn't hang out anymore. Charlotte couldn't even do her homework properly because I'd

So I treated her exactly like I treat my other friends, with boundaries. Tara and I had been together for two years, living together for one. We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer where I was supposed to be her plus 1. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends, get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends but not amazing partners. Here's what killed me, she said. All this while already having packed a bag bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay. You've already got an exit strategy. I said, we're adults, we're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies. Okay, I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. I treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7:00am Could you drop off my work laptop? Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office. Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. Got plans Monday works better. She didn't like that, but what was she going to say? We're just friends now. Week 2, Tara started cracking. She showed up at the apartment while I was at work, still using her key, helped herself to groceries, did laundry, took a shower. I texted her, I'll need the key back. My friends don't have keys to my place. This is ridiculous. We live together. We used to live together. Now we're friends. Different relationship, different boundaries. She came by that evening, furious. You changed the locks. You no longer live here. Here's a box of your stuff. I'm treating you exactly like I treat my friends. None of them have keys to my place. But I'm not just any friend. According to you, that's exactly what you are. The real kicker came at game night with our friend group. I showed up solo. She showed up with some dude named Connor from yoga, clearly trying to make me jealous. I shook his hand, welcomed him, then needed to destroy everyone at code names while paying them zero attention. Halfway through the night, Tara cornered me. You don't even care that I'm here with someone else. Why would I? We're friends. Friends date people. She couldn't answer because there was no answer that Didn't admit she wanted me to pine for her while she found herself. But the best part, her bestie, Marissa, had been extra friendly all night, kept finding excuses to talk to me, laugh at my jokes. This morning, Tara texted, what was that with you and Marissa? We were just talking. Friends talk. She's my best friend and I'm your friend, too, right? Friends can be friends with each other's friends. By week 3, Connor from yoga had ghosted Tara. Meanwhile, Marissa invited me to a comedy show. The date was fantastic. She was actually hilarious. Something I'd.

Every disaster in this house happens because you're constantly provoking Gonzales. I stared in disbelief while my 14 year old brother Gonzales sat there looking innocent. The kitchen fire last week, the destroyed laptop, the hole in the garage door. It's always when you two are together. We need peace. You have two weeks to find somewhere else to live. Gonzales smiled sweetly. I just want our family to be safe, he said, hiding behind my parents backs as he mouth goodbye. Fine.

Next, he discovered online chemistry tutorials without me. Secretly replacing his chemicals with baking soda. He created what he called rainbow smoke bombs in the kitchen. But they were actually just straight up acid that ate through the tiles and corrupted all the food. Hazmat Had to gut our kitchen entirely. Total cost $8,000. Why didn't you tell us this would happen? Mom yelled at me through the phone. I did. You just never listened. I reminded her. Then Gonzales revealed he'd been training squirrels in the attic.

So I decided to make her want to be child free too. I'm 26, child free by choice, and love my peaceful life. My brother Jason and his wife Amber have three kids under six. Pure chaos. Amber constantly lectures me about how I'm missing out and need to grow up. She posts passive aggressive Facebook memes about how real women become mothers and corners me at family events saying I'm depriving myself of purpose. Last Friday they called asking me to babysit Saturday for a wedding. I politely declined. I had plans with my friend Clara to go river tubing. We've been planning this for weeks. Amber lost it screaming about how I'm selfish and need to learn real responsibility. She ended the call with you need to grow up, Zoe. Saturday morning at 7:00am, I woke up to aggressive banging on my door. There were all three kids. Five year old Liam clutching a tablet, three year old Ava in a tutu with one sock, and baby Jackson screaming in his carrier. A sticky note on my door read be back Sunday. Thanks, Auntie Zoe. I literally just dumped them like Amazon packages and drove off to their wedding. I called Jason, straight to voicemail, texted Amber. Nothing. They turned off their phones expecting me to just suck it up and cancel My life for their convenience. This was their master plan. Force me into parenting to prove I was wrong about being childfree. Most people would stay home and complain. Not me. They wanted to prove I needed this experience. Fine. I'd give them an experience they'd never forget. I packed all three kids in waterproof gear and took them river tubing anyway. Clara met us at the launch, took one look at the chaos and said, you're absolutely insane, then helped me strap Liam into a life vest. Like this. Think she is. For two hours, we floated down the French Broad River. Ava wore glitter sunglasses and sang frozen songs at every passing kayaker like she was performing at Carnegie Hall. Liam tried catching fish with his bare hands and nearly looked out of his tube twice. Jackson actually calmed down once we got moving. The motion and fresh air put him right to sleep. The other river goers stared at our bizarre parade. A guy in a canoe asked if they were all mine. No, I said cheerfully. Just the world's most reluctant babysitter taking revenge on manipulative relatives. After tubing, we hit this dog friendly taco truck lot near Clara's place. She brought her rescue Mutt, Peaches, who immediately became the fourth child. The kids went absolutely wild over the picnic tables and dogs running around. We got them quesadillas with mild cheese and churros, which ended up mostly decorating Ava's face and hair. Jackson passed out. In his stroller, clutching half a churro like a trophy. I documented everything on Instagram. Photos of the kids.

What thing? I asked, confused because everything seemed present and accounted for. Your thing isn't there. She was staring at my junk with this weird concerned look. I tap my stick on her cheek trying to be funny. I think you're staring right at it. No, not that thing. Hold on. She reached out and started examining me more closely through my boxers and she said the words that ruined my birthday. Holy shit. I think you should get to a hospital. She made me pull up my pants and grab my keys. No explanation, just pure panic on her face. We got in my car and she insisted on driving because I was already freaking out. The whole ride to the emergency room, she kept glancing at me with this worried expression. What's wrong? Just tell me. I was starting to imagine the worst. She grip the steering wheel tighter. There's no easy way to say this, but you only have one ball. What? I actually yelled it so loud. She swerved a little. There's only one ball, one nut, one marble, whatever you want to call it. There's supposed to be two and you've got one. She was talking fast like she needed to get it all out. My mind was racing. How would I never notice this? I've been living in this body for 21 years and somehow missed that I was Anatomically incomplete. My hands were shaking as I tried to process what she was saying. Did it fall out? Was I born this way? What happened to my jelly beans? At the hospital, they took me back pretty quickly. Once I explained the situation, the doctor examined me and confirmed what Sienna had discovered. I definitely only had one testicle. But what he said next made even less sense. According to your medical records, this makes perfect sense. It's all here from the operation. He was reading from his computer screen. What operation? I've never had an operation in my life. I was completely lost. Now, the doctor looked up, surprised. You should probably take this up with your parents, but according to this, you had surgery when you were 7 years old. I called my dad right there from the hospital bed. He answered on the second ring all cheerful because he knew it was my birthday. But when I explained where I was and what I just Learned, his voice changed completely. I heard him say to my mom in the background, honey, he knows I'm gonna have to come clean to him now. My stomach dropped. Come clean about what? What else had they been hiding from me? My dad got back on the phone and took a deep breath. When you were 7 years old, you had testicular cancer. We caught it early and it was completely operable, but they had to remove one of your Test

My mom found my diary when I was 15 and thought she hit the Jackpot. She'd been trying to figure out what I was up to for months because I'd gotten really good at avoiding her interrogations about school and friends. The thing is, I knew she'd eventually find it because she has zero respect for privacy and goes through my stuff constantly. So I wrote everything in a simple code. Nothing fancy. Just shifted every letter three places forward in the alphabet. So A became D, B became E, and so on. Took me like, two minutes to learn, but it looked completely random to anyone who didn't know the pattern. My diary was full of normal teenage stuff written in code. Complaints about teachers, drama with my friend Jenna, crushes on boys. The usual. But my mom saw all these weird letter combinations and apparently convinced herself I was either doing drugs in some kind of cult or talking to dangerous people online. She spent three weeks trying to crack what she thought was some elaborate secret code. I watched her stay up late at the kitchen table with my diary, a notebook, and her laptop trying different translation methods. She even printed out code breaking guides from the internet. My dad told her she was being ridiculous, but she was convinced she was about to uncover some major teenage conspiracy. The breaking point came when she decided My coded entries about liking this guy Tyler in my chemistry class were actually me planning to buy drugs. She figured out a few words here and there, but was reading everything completely wrong in her mind. Tyler is so cute when he explains molecular structures. Became some kind of drug deal arrangement. She confronted me on a Tuesday morning before school, waving my diary around and demanding I tell her what the code meant. She called my school counselor, was threatening to call the police, and had already scheduled a family therapy session. She. I was completely panicked and convinced I was in serious danger. I just stared at her for a minute, then grabbed a pen and paper. I wrote out the alphabet, then wrote it again underneath. With each letter shifted three spots. Showed her how D meant A, E meant B, and so on. Then I decoded one of her drug deal entries right in front of her. So cute when he explains molecular structures. Her face went through about five different emotions in 10 seconds. First confusion, then understanding, then embarrassment, then anger, then this weird, defeated look. She'd spent weeks losing sleep over my crush on a boy who is good at chemistry. The worst part for her was that she'd already called my Aunt Linda and my grandma asking for advice about my secret coded communications with dangerous strangers. She worked herself up so much that she'd gotten the whole family worried about Me. My dad, who'd been watching this whole thing unfold from the doorway, just started laughing. Not mean laughing, but that kind of tired laughter when something ridiculous finally makes sense. He'd been telling my mom for weeks that I was probably just writing normal teenage stuff and she was overthinking it. My mom tried to get mad at me for deliberately deceiving her, but honestly, what did she expect? She goes through my room constantly, reads my text when I leave my phone around, and asked my friend's parents about what we do when we hang out. I needed some kind of privacy, and a simple letter substitution wasn't exactly CIA level encryption. The really awkward part was when she to call everyone back and explain that there was no crisis. She had to tell my Aunt Linda that my coded messages about dangerous activities were actually just me writing about how Tyler had nice eyes and helped me with homework. My grandma, who'd been praying for my safety for two weeks, was not thrilled about the false alarm. My school counselor, Mrs. Peterson, called me down to her office later that week to check in. My mom had told her I was using secret codes to hide dangerous behavior, so she wanted to make sure everything was okay. When I. I explained what actually happened, she just sighed and said she'd seen parents do much stranger things trying to monitor their kids. The family therapy session. My mom Had scheduled, still happened. Which was probably good, because we needed to talk about boundaries. The therapist basically told my mom that going through my private stuff constantly was pushing me to be more secretive, not less. She explained that if my mom wanted me to be honest with her, she needed to give me some space to be a teenager. My mom didn't love hearing that, but my dad backed up the therapist. He pointed out that in all her searching through my stuff over the years, she'd never actually found anything concerning. I was a pretty boring kid who did my homework, hung out with the same three friends, and had normal teenage problems.

When did listening to your spouse lead to something completely unexpected? My wife Julia has this thing about getting weird feelings about stuff. After eight years of marriage, I'd Learned to trust her instincts, even when they made zero sense. Last Saturday morning, she woke up and told me to skip my fishing trip with the guys and come with her to a flea market two towns over. When I asked why, she just shrugged and said she had a weird feeling I should be there. I was pretty annoyed. I've been looking forward to fishing all week, and driving 40 minutes to look at old junk wasn't exactly my idea of fun. But Julia kept insisting, saying she couldn't shake the feeling that something important was waiting for us there. She promised to make my favourite dinner if I came along, so I gave in. We got to the flea market early, around seven in the morning. The place was huge, with hundreds of vendors selling everything from rusty tools to old vinyl records. Julia dragged me past tables of dusty books and broken appliances until she stopped dead. At this one vendor's table, an elderly woman was selling wooden crates and boxes. Most of them looked like they'd been sitting in someone's basement for decades. Julia pointed at one specific crate that was nailed shut. It was about the size of a shoebox, made of dark wood that looked really old. The woman wanted $30 for It. Which seemed crazy for something we couldn't even see inside. But Julia wouldn't budge. She said she wanted that exact crate and nothing else would do. I rolled my eyes, but carried it to the car. On the drive home. I kept asking what she thought was in there, but she just said she didn't know. She kept touching the crate like it was precious or something. When we got home, I grabbed a crowbar from the garage and pried off the wooden lid. Inside were stacks of military medals wrapped in faded tissue paper, along with black and white photographs and a leather bound journal. My hands started shaking when I saw the name engraved on the metals. William Chen Harrison. That was my grandfather's full name. He'd served in World War 2, but never talked about his time overseas. He died when I was 12, and my family always said he kept his war experiences to himself. I picked up the journal with trembling fingers. The first page was written in my grandfather's handwriting, which I recognized from birthday cards he used to send me. But this wasn't just war stories. The journalist described a hidden stash of war bonds and gold coins he'd buried in a metal chest on his old farm before he shipped out. He'd drawn a detailed map showing exactly where he buried it, near an old oak tree behind the storage shed. The farm was still in our family's name, though it had Been abandoned for years. My dad had inherited it, but never did anything with the property since it was way out in the middle of nowhere. According to the journal, my grandfather had planned to dig up the treasure when he got back from the war and use it to buy a house for his secret fiance, a woman named

Your cell phone rings and you don't recognize the number. What do you do? Ignore it. Ignore it. Don't answer it. Not me. I like life. The other day my cell phone rang 9, 1 7. That's a New York number. I didn't know who it was. I picked it up anyway. I hit talk. I said, hello. Guy in the line goes, hey, Bruce, what's going on? My name is Jay, not Bruce. So I said, nothing much, man. What's going on with you? And he said, I'll tell you what's going on. I just got an email about the budget. It's supposed to be 15,000. Now it's 10,000. And I'd like to know what's up. I got excited in my chest. I grabbed the steering wheels like, okay, focus, your name is Bruce. There's a budget. It was 15,000, now it's 10,000. No one's happy about it. That's all we know. That's all we know. So I just repeated back to him what he said to me. And I go, 10,000 is supposed to be 15,000. He goes, yeah, I know. Well, I just got an email and now it's ten. I go, listen, man, I don't know what to tell you. I've been on the road all day. You know, I haven't even seen it. And he goes, did you send this out? I give him some attitude to Bruce. I didn't like it. I said, listen, man, the budget was 15,000. We had a couple extra Expenditures it went up to 16 2 I reworked it, got it down to 14 7 I had 300 to play with so I called it 15 and I sent it out and he goes, yeah, well now it's 10 man and I was like, oh my god that worked that worked phase one complete phase one complete like now I'm in the door. I have a 4:01 k I was at the Christmas party okay, so he goes, did Larry okay this I go, listen man I took the budget to Larry. Larry said it looked fine but I knew it was my ass on the line so I ran it by Jennifer just in case, just a double check. Jennifer said it looked good. I sent it out he goes, yeah, well now it's 10 man and I realized this guy has no idea what's going on over there he hasn't talked to Larry. I know he hasn't talked to Bruce. He doesn't even recognize my voice. I know he didn't talk to Jennifer. I just made her up so he goes, listen man, what are we gonna do about this? And I go, listen, I'm on the road right now. I haven't even seen the email. Why don't you give Larry a call, check in with him, see what he says, call me back just praying he will because that return phone call was going to be amazing and he goes, you know what? Why don't wait? Till you get home, you check the email, you call Larry, you call me back, and I go, nah, nah, bro. Larry knows way more about this than I do. Give him a call, call me back. He goes, okay, hangs up the phone, to which I explode with euphoria because there's a small business in New York that is crumbling to the ground over five grand and nobody can find Jennifer. They're looking, they're looking. I get home, I'm so excited. I take out my cell phone. I'm like, you know what? I'm gonna save that guy's number, give him a call in a couple days, touch base, you know what I mean? Check in, see where we're at, you know? So I save it in my phone under Random Guy. That's what he is. He's a random guy. Four or five days pass, I forget about it. Laying on my couch watching the ball game, phone rings in the dining room table. I get up watching the game, grab the phone, watching the game, look down, random guy.

Uh, I think Joe already has. Yeah. You think Joe already has? Okay. Yeah, this is gonna sound really pervy of me to ask, but I kind of need to know what was in the picture but let, let me clarify why I'm saying all this. Last year a guy called us. He found naked pictures of his fiance on her phone and she was sending them, it turns out she was sending them to a girlfriend who works at a plastic surgery place. Like I guess the DOC over there needed pictures of her stomach or something to see if she was a candidate. I don't know. But when we called her up, she basically told us the whole story. So getting back to what you found on your wife's phone, do these pictures look more scientific or are they definitely like sexy time pictures? Oh, no, there's nothing clinical about these pictures. They are totally all about the sex. She's like, she's in the bathtub, she's posing, she's pouting. She's like looking at the camera she's touching herself. There is one with in a like it is definitely okay 100% sexual. Alright, and so keep going. And you said you have no idea who she's sending these to. Well, that's that's why I called you guys. I, I can't I'm finding it difficult bringing it up with her. So yeah, I need to find out. Okay, so the mission today is to find out who she's sending these pics of herself to. Yeah, help. Yeah. You know, she could be putting together one of those sexy photo shoot thingy book thingies, you know, like for Valentine's Day. Has she ever done that before? Anything? Yeah. Yeah. Well, no, well, not for me anyway. Well, do you know if she's mentioned it like have any of her friends done it for their husbands or boyfriends? Um, I, I'm not really sure this is the first I've ever heard of anybody doing that to be exact. But no, I don't think so. I'll bet you that's what it is. Okay. Well, if it is that I'll put my hands up and say I'm paranoid, but I generally don't think that's what it is. Okay, well, let's find out. So this is gonna be tricky cause we have no number right? Like you don't know for a fact that she sent it to some guy and here's his number. No, no, I have no idea who she's sending them to. Okay, shag, let's Let's do this. Get his wife's number, okay? And then text her a message. Something like this. Something like, hey, guess who got a new phone? And then right, here's a hint, I know what you look like in the bathtub. Okay? And then put like hard eyes or winky face, whatever. Let's see what she texts back and then we'll decide what we wanna do from there when we come back. Now let's get to what we texted shag, why you read what you texted to her, to Heather, to Colin's wife. Guys, kind of like what you said. I wrote, hey, guess who got a new phone? Here's a hint, I know what you look like in a bathtub. And then I did the little heart eyes. Okay? And read what she wrote back. Okay? What she wrote back, she said, hey baby, so is this your new phone? Okay, so, okay, so listen, in a sec, I want you to write her back, right? Yes, give me a call real quick, but call me on my work phone and then give her the hotline number so she calls us instead. Okay? Don't do it yet, ash. If she calls the hotline, when you answer, just say this. Say good morning. Thank you for calling. How may I direct your call? Okay? That way she'll ask for whoever she thinks she's calling.

So, so you didn't even hire him? No, he has not been hired. He told us differently. What was he like in the job interview? He was just kind of all over the place. You know, he, he just wasn't an ideal candidate. I don't know. He was acting strange. Maybe he was stoned. I don't know. Stoned? Come on. What is happening? That is Luke. He was actually on the other night listening to this conversation and wants to talk to you.

Apparently this dude hates Carrie and she has no idea why. He moved in just a little bit ago. She's been trying to introduce herself to him cause she also thinks that he's cute. She waved at him a few times. He's just ignored her. She walked up to his door to try to say hi and he just shut it in her face. And then she made him some cookies, left it on his porch with a little note. He walked outside, stomped out the cookies and then kicked the plate. And she has no idea why this guy doesn't like her so much. she got a hold of the homeowner association and got his phone number and now she's about to call him and see if she can figure it out. Alright, Carrie, are you ready to go? Yep, let's do it, guy. Are you sure you wanna do this? Are you just the type of person who can't stand when somebody doesn't like you? I mean, it's not that I can't stand someone not liking me, but I want people to be decent with me. You know what I mean? Okay. Like at least treat me like a human being. Are you angry with him over the cookie incident? A little Bit I mean it took me a lot of time to make those cookies and I like that plate that's completely shattered now. So yeah, he did ruin your plate. Yeah, I wanna know why he would do something like that and why he won't even like acknowledge my existence. Okay, well, my advice I would just start by being polite don't really come at him mean and just see if maybe you can figure out why he doesn't like you and don't let on too much that you've been staring at him through your windows observing every move he makes because that may put him off. Okay. Alright, I'm gonna dial his phone number right now and then you can make your awkward Tuesday phone call. Are you ready? Hurry up. Okay, here we go. Hello. Hi. Is this Matthew? Uh, yes, it is. Who's this? Hi, my name is Carrie. I'm your neighbor from across the way. Uh, hi. Hi. Um, can I help you? Yeah, I'm sorry. I just wanted to call cause I've seen you around and I thought maybe I could introduce myself and maybe you know get to know you better. Yeah, no, I mean, I guess that's a nice thing to do. I mean it's good to get to know your neighbors. Um, yeah, I mean, where did you come from? Where where did you move from? Oh, um, you know, I actually I just moved from kind of like a few blocks Away. I'm just, you know, I, this is a better deal. Um, but, uh, how long have you lived in the neighborhood? I've been here for like a couple years. I'm the neighbor who lives across the street from you, in case you're curious. Yeah. No, that's good. Good for you. That's good. That's great. Um, you sound really nice. Um, thank you. I think I, uh, you know, try to be a nice person. Uh, can I ask you a question? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Well, I just had this kind of feeling from our interactions that we've had that you don't really like me and I want to know why. Like, what did I do? What interactions have we had? I don't, I don't even know who you are. I mean, you know, you've seen me. There have been times we both have been out of the house and you've been mean to me and I just don't really know what I did that would, you know, instigate that I've been mean to you. How have I been mean to you? I mean, I waved at you and you completely ignored me. And I don't know if you remember this, but, uh, a while back I was walking up to your porch when you were there and you stood up, looked at me and then just turned around and closed the door in my face. Oh my God. Did we know each other or something in college? Like, do We work together. Oh, man. I, I just, I wanna know. It's been eating me up. I'm, I really sorry that I, you know, inadvertently. I mean, I don't understand why you're laughing. I'm not laughing at you. I'm just laughing at the situation. Um, there's actually a pretty good explanation for all of this. I, well, I'd love to hear it cause this has been like really awkward for me. Yeah. No, I'm not ignoring you. I'm not being mean. I'm blind.

But her face immediately dropped when she realised that we tricked her. My sister in law, Maya, has always been competitive with me since the day I married her brother Jake. She couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, I tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me. And from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd de flesh, she'd push harder. Come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nursery and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail when she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages desperately searching for any Evidence of our name decision, my husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use it first. She wouldn't do that, he said, but I knew better. This is exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created bacon twist boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with Final Decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition and I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think, she'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived. The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to Her surprise, the next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness when I walked into her room. She actually had the audacity to say, I hope you don't mind that we ended up using Aurora when she was born. It just felt so right for our daughter. I know you guys were considering it, too. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed her our real pic.

Cut costs, use frozen ingredients, fire half the kitchen staff. People can't tell the difference anyway, he'd say, counting receipts. While I fought to maintain the standards that built our reputation, I refused to compromise our lamb. Also buco was legendary. Our house made pasta brought people from three states over. I wasn't about to ruin that for Giovanni's profit margins. So on my 32nd birthday, after our biggest week ever, he called me into the cramped office above the dining room. Birthday balloons from the staff still hung in the kitchen below. Here's my surprise for you, he said with this smug grin. You're fired effective immediately. You're too difficult to work with. I stood there, soft stained apron still tied around my waist, watching him lean back in his father's old chair like he just solved World hunger. I didn't argue, didn't cry, just untied my apron, set it on his desk and walked out past the confused prep cooks who'd worked under me for years. The drive home felt endless. Three years of my life gone. My reputation, my team, my recipes all handed over to someone who thought ketchup was a vegetable. My husband, Scott was waiting in our kitchen with a bottle of wine and that knowing smile he gets when he's up to something. How did the birth a shift go, he asked. Already pouring two glasses. Terrible. Giovanni fired me. His grin widened. Perfect timing. What do you mean perfect timing? I just lost my job. We have a mortgage, Scott bills. He pulled out his laptop, fingers dancing across the key board. Remember that food critic from the times who came in last month, Julia Chen, the one who wrote that amazing review about your lamb dish? Yeah, of course. She said it was transcendent. Why? Well, Scott said, turning the screen toward me, she's been discreetly asking around town about hiring a private chef for her daughter's wedding next weekend. Very exclusive, very high paying. I may have already told her you'd be available. I stared at the email thread. Julia had been trying to reach me for weeks, but Giovanni never passed along messages. She was offering $15,000 for a single event, more than I made in three months at Romano's. Scott, how did you, my phone buzz Text message, then another. Then it started ringing. Giovanni's number flashed on the screen. I let it go to voicemail. Then more calls. The assistant manager, the sous chef, even the dishwasher. By the time I checked, there were 47 missed calls. And count, Scott was refreshing his laptop cackling. Oh, this is beautiful. Look, a skating review had just gone live on every major food blog and review site, posted an hour ago, right around when Giovanni would have been running dinner service without me. Romano's Restaurant, a spectacular fall from Grace, read the headline. The review was brutal. Food quality has completely collapsed, undercooked chicken, rude service. Avoid at all costs.

In my family, skinny daughters were worthless, and fat daughters were currency. The heavier you were, the higher your bride price. Every girl at 13 got sent to the fattening house for a minimum of two years. Where gaining weight wasn't a suggestion, it was survival. I grew up watching my older cousins disappear into that house walking on their own two feet and wheeled out in chairs too heavy to stand. My cousin Amara went in at 115 pounds and came out at 340. She was married within a week to a man who paid extra for her stretch marks. They called them beauty lines. But I saw how she gasped for air walking to her own wedding. The process was simple. Six meals a day, each one monitored by the house mothers. You sat in a circle while they ladled bowls of crushed millet mixed with butter, sugar and milk down your throat. If you threw up, they'd make you eat the vomit. Waste nothing, gain everything, my aunt would say cheerfully, while girls cried into their bowls. 4,000 calories per meal, minimum. They had tricks to make you hungrier. Salt baths that made you retain water, medications that increased appetite. Exercise was forbidden, except for throat stretches to help you swallow faster. My sister Kayla tried doing squats in secret. They caught her and force fed her until her stomach. Nearly as punishment, she had to eat standing up for a month. I was 11 when I found the death book hidden in my grandmother's closet while looking for Eid money. Names and weights filled three notebooks. Amara, age 22, heart failure, 389 pounds. Fatu, age 19, diabetes coma, 412 pounds. Mariama, age 24, stroke, 445 pounds. Page after page of girls who never made it to third. The weights next to their names weren't just numbers. They were their sale prices. But what really made me sick was the profit column. Beside each death, my grandmother had calculated how much money the family made from their bride price minus funeral costs. Tattoo's death netted the family $85,000. Her husband kept the dowry even though she only lived four months after the wedding. That's when I started planning. I was smart about it. Told everyone I was starting a traditional cooking circle for younger girls to prepare them for the fattening house. We met every Thursday in my uncle's garage teaching recipes. But what I really taught was chemistry. The exact amount of salt to retain 20 pounds of water weight for weigh ins. How to make fake fat suits from layered fabric and memory foam. Ways to trigger temporary bloating that would disappear after measurements. We got creative as hell. Practice eating competitions where girls Learned to hide food in their cheeks and spit it out. Later developed a system of herbal teas that lost appetite while making your face look puffy. Made our own weight gain shakes that were actually Just protein powder and laxatives. The house mothers thought we were so dedicated. My genius move was suggesting we document our journey for marriage advertisements. We took photos, but Learned exactly which angles and clothing made you look 50 pounds heavier. Bought a broken scale that added 80 pounds and swapped it during official weigh ins. By the time I turned 13 and entered the house myself, I had a network of 15 girls, all trained in the art of fake fattening. We shared clothes that had hidden weights sewn into the hems. Learned to walk slow and breathe heavy like we were carrying extra weight. Perfected the arm positions that made our pictures look massive. The house mothers praised us constantly. Look how well Alia gains, they'd say, as I stepped on the rigged scale. We became their star students while secretly flushing thousands of calories down the toilet every night. Some girls Learned to throw up silently. Others developed jaw techniques that made swallowing look real.

I was in the middle of texting my friends the road work ahead Vine during math class when the principal coughed over the school intercom, the telltale sign that he was about to make an announcement. Attention all students and staff. No one is to leave their classrooms. Everyone must remain seated until further notice. This is for your safety as much as ours. Usually no one gave an F what the teacher said, but now it was so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. Even missus Peterson stopped writing on the board mid sentence. We heard ambulances outside and she told us to sit in our seats. We were all glancing at each other around the room, wide eyed and curious. Nobody said anything, but we were all thinking the same thing. One of the teachers had died. The red and blue lights flashed across the walls, and we heard screams from the other grades echoing throughout the building. Missus Peterson told us that it wasn't a big deal and we should all be focusing on our studies. But she could barely get the words out from how hard she was hyperventilating, so much so that she didn't even care. As we all started to take our phones out and text our theories into the Snapchat group chat about what was going down, then we heard it. Footsteps running past our door. Heavy ones. Multiple sets I Couldn't help myself. I had to look. I crept to the door and peeked through the window. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops. Get away from the door, Eve. Missus Peterson whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Suddenly, people's bitmojis were popping up faster than a whack a mole game. Maybe someone finally took out Mr. Jordan, the creepy history teacher? Nah, someone definitely just had an allergic reaction. That allergies go crazy. Another one said that maybe someone had taken too much vent. Missus Peterson tried to continue the lesson. Something about the Revolutionary War, but nobody was listening. How could we care about some battle from 200 years ago when someone might be dying down the hall right now? Finally, there was a knock at the door. It was the principal standing beside a police officer. Eve O'Brien, the principal announced. My heart dropped. That was me. Can you come with us, please? Bring your things. I silently got up and followed, not knowing what the f was going on. In the hallway, I could see the paramedics near the gym. One was sitting on the floor filling out paperwork. The stretcher was off to the side. When they brought me into the office, I was faced with my parents sitting on the wooden chairs. Well, my parents are divorced. And I hadn't seen them sit in the same room since I was seven. So now I was really confused. Suddenly, my mom stood up and lunged at me for a hug. I'm so sorry, she repeated over and over. I pushed her off of me. Guys, it's okay. I mean, the

I was driving home from my girlfriend's place around midnight when my car started making this horrible grinding noise. Steam was pouring from under the hood. I pulled over on this empty back road and called Del AAA, but they said it would be two hours minimum. That's when this pickup truck pulled up behind me. Guy gets out and walks over, probably mid 40s, wearing coveralls, like a mechanic. Seemed friendly enough. Car trouble, he asked. Yeah, I think it's the radiator. I said I can take a look if you want. I run a shop in town. He popped my hood and poked around for a minute. Yep, radiator hose is shot, but I got some tools in my truck that might get you home. While he was getting his tools, I noticed something weird. His truck had no license plate, just an empty bracket where it should be. He came back with a toolbox and started working. That's when I saw the inside of his truck through the open door. There were zip ties scattered on the passenger seat, lots of them, and what looked like a roll of duct tape. You know, he said, not looking up from the engine, you picked a real isolated spot to break down. Nobody comes down this road at night. My stomach dropped. Yeah, just bad luck, I guess, or good luck, depending on how you look at it. He glanced Up at me with this weird smile for me. Anyway, I started backing away slowly. Actually, I think I'll just wait for the tow truck. Tow truck. He laughed. I called and canceled that while you weren't looking. Told them you got it sorted out. He pulled something from his toolbox, not a wrench, but a Taser. Now we can do this easy or hard. Your choice. I turned and ran into the woods behind me. I heard him yell, you're just making this more fun. I crashed through branches in total darkness using my phone's flashlight. I could hear him following, breaking through the brush behind me. The light from his flashlight kept getting closer. I tripped over a fallen log and went down hard, scraping my hands and knees. When I looked back, his light was maybe 30 yards away. That's when I saw it.

My daughter's school counselor called during my lunch break. We need you to come immediately, her voice trembled. Lily's refusing to speak to anyone. My heart stopped. Lily, my bubbly 7 year old who never stopped talking, refusing to speak. The same girl who gave a presentation on butterflies to angels at the park last weekend. I dropped everything and broke every speed limit driving to her school. The halls were eerily quiet. My heels echoing against the colorful tile floors lined with student artwork. Lily's butterfly drawing stared back at me from the star student wall. I found my daughter curled into herself in the corner chair, knees pulled tight against her chest. Her eyes were vacant, unfocused. Her yellow dress, her favorite, was wrinkled and dirty at the hem. The sparky butterfly clip I'd fastened in her hair that morning was gone. Lily Bean, I whispered, kneeling beside her. When I touched her shoulder, she flinched like my fingers were made of fire. I'd never seen her like this, not when she fell off her bike and needed stitches, not when our dog died. What happened? I demanded, turning to the counselor, fighting to keep panic from overtaking me. She shifted uncomfortably. We're not sure. She was fine at recess. Then her teacher sent her to music class. When Mister Roberts brought her back, she was like this. The principal joined us. His tie is slightly askew. Children sometimes have emotional Episodes, he said, not meeting my eyes. Perhaps something upset her with her friends. I took Lily home that night. She wouldn't eat dinner, wouldn't talk, just clutched her favorite stuffed rabbit with the missing ear. While helping her change into pajamas, I noticed dark purple bruises encircling her wrists like macabre bracelets. My stomach lurched. Baby, who did this to you? I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. Her tiny voice finally broke through. So quiet I had to lean close. Mr Roberts said, it's our secret game. If I tell, something bad will happen to you and daddy. My blood turned to ice. Mr Roberts, the beloved music teacher who'd been with the school for five years, the one parents fought to have their children placed with because he made special time for talented students. I called the police that night with a child psychologist help. The interview revealed everything. For months, Roberts had been taking special students to the supply closet.

You're presented with two options never having to shower again or never having to poop again. Here's how they work never shower again. With this power, you're always clean, fresh, and hygienic without ever needing to step into a shower or bath. Your skin remains free of dirt and oils, and you naturally smell great no matter what. However, you'll still need to handle things like styling your hair, shaving, or other grooming habits that aren't directly tied to cleanliness. While you'll never have to worry about bad hygiene, you'll still need to manage the aesthetic aspects of your appearance. Never poop again. If you choose this option, you'll never need to defecate again. Your digestive system functions perfectly, but waste is magically removed before it reaches your bowels. You won't feel bowel pressure, discomfort, or any health issues related to digestion. However, you'll still have to urinate on a normal schedule, and your body otherwise operates as it does now, minus the inconvenience of bathroom trips. For No. 2, both powers come without any hidden drawbacks or consequences. You simply gain the benefit of removing one of life's recurring annoyances. So would you embrace the freedom of never showering while staying perfectly fresh, or would you choose the relief of never needing to poop again? Which power would improve your life the most?

Then he looked at me totally serious and said, are you gonna cancel the date now? Like a nervous middle schooler, I fell for him right there, socks and all. Two, we were at the arcade and he got way too invested in the claw machine, not for himself, but because he saw a stuffed turtle. He said, look like me when I'm cranky.

After my husband and I announced our pregnancy at 12 weeks, things with Kate got really weird. Suddenly, Kate was everywhere we went sporting a small baby bump. She showed up at our favorite brunch spot rubbing her belly. She enrolled in our exact prenatal yoga class. She even switched to our OB practice.

She went on about water retention and bloating and how pregnant women deal with enough judgment without their friends piling on. Our friend felt terrible and apologized profuse while the rest of us comforted Kate. After that night, nobody dared mention anything about her appearance again, even though I started Noticing her bump size seemed to fluctuate, too. That's when things got uncomfortable. Kate started making comments about how wild it was that we got pregnant around the same time. She'd joke about our babies being best friends, maybe even more than friends someday. Then the jokes got stranger, like when she said pregnancy brain made her forget exactly when she conceived. And wasn't it funny how close our due dates were? She started showing up at every single appointment Zach and I had, always in the waiting room when we arrived. Claiming her appointment was right before or after hours during our maternity photo shoot at the park, she appeared with her own photographer, saying what a coincidence that she booked the same spot. The photographer later told me Kate had called asking what time we'd be there. Everything exploded at my baby shower. My sister threw this beautiful garden party with all our family and friends there to celebrate. Halfway through opening gifts, Kate stood up and clinked her glass to make an announcement. With tears streaming down her face, she placed her hand on her belly and said, I have the most wonderful news to share with everyone. Zack and I are having a baby together. The entire party gasped and she continued with a huge smile. I know this is unconventional, but isn't it beautiful that our babies will be siblings?

My dad showed up at my apartment with flowers for me like I was his girlfriend. And my fiance had to tell him he was my father, not my husband. I always knew my dad was weird about me. When my parents divorced when I was nine, my mom moved on pretty quick. Found herself a nice guy named Paul who treated me like a normal stepdaughter. But my dad, he never dated anyone. Ever. He'd always say I was his whole world and he didn't need anyone else. First it felt special. He'd pick me up from school with my favourite candy. He'd take me shopping and let me get whatever I wanted. He called our Saturday hangouts daddy daughter dates, which seemed normal enough when I was 10, but things got weird as I got older. When I started wearing makeup in eighth grade, he threw it all away and said I was too beautiful to need that garbage. When I got my first phone, he demanded all my passwords because he needed to protect me from predators. He'd scroll through my texts every night at dinner. High school was worse. He hated all my friends, especially the guys. If I hung out with anyone he didn't approve of, he'd give me the silent treatment for days. Just sit at dinner staring at his plate, acting like I didn't exist until I apologized. The worst was when I told him I was dating Trevor when I was 17. We were driving to target, and I casually mentioned I had a boyfriend. He pulled into the parking lot and just started crying. Like, ugly sobbing. He said I was throwing away everything we had together for some stupid boy who didn't really know me. I felt so guilty. I broke up with Trevor the next week. College gave me some space. He'd call me three times a day. If I didn't answer, he'd drive the two hours to campus to make sure I was okay. My roommate thought it was sweet at first, until she saw him show up at 1:00am because I'd fallen asleep without texting him goodnight. After graduation, I moved to my own apartment and met Malik at my job. He was calm.

So my girlfriend Gabrielle drops this bombshell on me last month over Chinese takeout. I want us to see other people. I nearly choked on my lo Mein. We've been together two years. Just signed a lease together three months ago. Wait, what? Why? She gets this look like she's been rehearsing this. I met someone at my yoga class. My name is Jeremy, and there's just this connection. So you want to break up? No. I love our stability. I just want to explore my options while keeping you as my foundation. Foundation? Like I'm concrete? She's building on Gabriel, that's not how relationships work. It could be. No pressure, no jealousy. We both get to experience new things. I set down my food. Okay, but if we're doing this, it go was both ways. I'm dating, too. She actually laughed, threw her head back and cackled. Oh, honey, good luck with that. See, Gabrielle's always thought she was out of my league. I'm a software developer, pretty quiet. She's this Instagram yoga instructor with 12,000 followers. She constantly makes jokes about how she settled down early and how I outkicked my coverage. I'm serious, Gabrielle. If you're seeing other people, so am I. Sure, baby. You do that. The condescension lit something inside me. That weekend, while she was at Jeremy's overnight, I downloaded every dating app, updated my profile, mentioned I code And play guitar. Matches started rolling in immediately. Turns out stable guys with jobs are popular. First date was Whitney, a teacher. We talked for three hours. She actually listened when I explained my work. Day two was Tiffany, a nurse who played guitar. We jammed together. She said I had really good hands. Gabriel barely noticed I was gone. Then my third match was Jeremy, Gabriel's yoga instructor. Jeremy, his profile said. Looking for genuine connection. I thought, why not see what this guy's about? We matched instantly met for coffee downtown. I could see why Gabrielle was interested. Tall, athletic, at Zen Vibe. But as we talked, something clicked. He was smart, funny, asked about my projects with actual curiosity. Can I be honest? He said after an hour. There's this woman in my class who's been very forward. Keeps talking about how her boyfriend doesn't understand her. My stomach dropped. What's her name? Gabrielle. She says he's boring, that she's settling until something better comes along. He sipped his coffee. I'm not interested in being someone's upgrade. I wanna be someone's first choice. I stared at him. Jeremy, I need to tell you something. I'm Gabrielle's boyfriend. His eyes went wide. Oh, god. I'm so sorry. She made it sound like you guys were roommates. We ended up talking for two more hours. Tons in common. SCI fi, movies, video games, similar music taste. This might sound crazy, Jeremy said, but wanna hang out again as friends? Friends turned into something more pretty quickly. Next week, Jeremy suggested

So I introduced him to my actual boyfriend. For 8 months, sane, acted like my boyfriend in every way possible. We hung out four times a week. He'd sleep over constantly, even had his own drawer at my place. He'd get visibly jealous whenever other guys talk to me at parties, always finding excuse, this is to interrupt conversations or pull me away. He bought me flowers just because, remembered my coffee order perfectly. And we'd spend entire weekends together binge watching shows and cooking dinner like a real couple. My friends all assumed we were dating. My family invited him to barbecue. Even his mom would ask about his girlfriend when she called. But whenever anyone directly asked if we were together, Zane would laugh it off awkwardly. Oh, no, we're just really close friends. I'm not ready for anything serious right now. It stung every single time, but I kept hoping he'd come around. I thought maybe he just needed more time to feel comfortable with labels. Last Friday night changed everything. We were at Kelsey's birthday party and this girl, Alexis from his work showed up. She was clear flirting with him all night, touching his arm, laughing way too loud at his jokes. Finally, she looked me up and down and asked directly, so are you his girlfriend or what? Without hesitation, Zane immediately said, oh, no, we're definitely not together. I'm completely single. Actually, he even stepped lightly. Away from me. When he said it, the humiliation hit me like a truck. Everyone with an earshot was staring. Kelsey looked mortified. For me, I felt my cheeks burning with embarrassment. But instead of running away, crying like I want.

Before anyone could react, my niece walked straight up to the CEO, looked him up and down and asked in her clear carrying voice, are you the big boss man? The partners froze. The CEO raised his eyebrows and nodded slowly. My career flashed before my eyes. My niece unzipped her backpack and pulled out a slightly squished chocolate cupcake and plastic wrap. My aunt said the big boss man here is super scary and might make her mess up her words because her brain gets wobbly when she's nervous. She placed the cupcake in front of the stunned CEO. When I get scared at school, my mom says sugar helps brave come out. So I saved this from my lunch for you so you can stop being scary and my aunt's brain can work again. The silence was deafening. I contemplated whether I could fit under the conference table. Then the CE E O, this man who reportedly made junior associates cry during performance reviews let out a deep genuine laugh. Well, he said, unwrapping the cupcake, that's the most on best assessment of my interview technique I've ever received. He took a bite then turned to me with frosting on his lip. Your niece is right. I've been unnecessarily intimidating. Let's restart this conversation, but this time I'd like to hear about how you handled the West Moreland case. I read your brief. It was impressive. As the interview continued with a completely different tone, my Niece sat on the CEO's leather chair, spinning happily, occasionally offering every 1 life advice. When we finally left, the CEO walked us to the elevator. We'll be in touch very soon, he said, and bent down to my niece's level. And thank you for the cupcake. It definitely helped my brave come out. I got the job offer the next morning. Two years later, the cupcake story is still legendary at the firm.

Yeah, I'm sorry. You had a bunch in that pack. I thought it wouldn't be bad if I ate a couple. Cecilia rushed over and grabbed my face, forcing my mouth open. She stared inside like she was looking for something specific, and her face went white. We have to make you throw up right now. Why? I thought it was just candy. My voice came out muffled because she was still holding my jaw. She dragged me to the bathroom and started shoving her fingers toward my throat. I pulled away, disgusted and confused, but she kept trying. When that didn't work, she ran to the kitchen and came back with a glass of lemon juice mixed with baking soda. The smell alone made me gag, but she forced me to drink it. Nothing happened except my stomach felt weird and bubbly. Cecilia then tried making me spin in circles. She said motion sickness might help. I spun until I was dizzy, but still nothing. She made me drink salt water next, which tasted horrible and made me cough, but I still didn't throw up. She was getting more desperate by the second. Celia, what's wrong? Just tell me what I ate. I was scared now because she was acting insane. She ignored me and ran to get ipecac syrup from the medicine cabinet, but the bottle was expired and empty. She started crying, actual tears, and pulling at her hair. I'd never seen my sister this freaked out about anything. She grabbed my shoulders and shook me, asking exactly where I found the candy and how many I ate. I told her it was in the small round container in her backpack, the one that looked like an Altoid's tin, but fancier. She asked what color the pills were and if I was sure I ate them all. I said they were different colors, like some were white and some were pink, and maybe one was green. I eating at least six or seven while gaming because they tasted kind of sweet. My mom heard all the chaos and came upstairs to find Cecilia kneeling next to me by the toilet. What's going on here? Cecilia whispered something in Mom's ear, and I watched my mother's expression change from annoyed to terrified in about two seconds. She grabbed her car keys and told me to put on shoes immediately because we were going to the hospital. No explanation, just pure panic on both their faces. The car ride was the scariest 15 minutes of my life.

She has no right to know everything about my marriage just because she raised my husband. My husband, Jake, lost his parents when he was 8 and his older sister, Becca, basically became his mom. She was only 16 at the time, but somehow managed to keep them both afloat. Jake always talked about how she gave up her teenage years to make sure he had clean clothes and hot meals. I get that their bond is special. I really do. But Becca acts like she owns Jake. When we first started dating three years ago, she'd call him every single night at exactly nine PM if he didn't pick up, she'd blow up his phone until he did. She needed to know where he was, who he was with, what he ate for dinner. It was weird, but Jake said it was normal for them. Then we moved in together last year. Becca had a spare key to our apartment. Within a week, he'd show up unannounced on Saturday mornings with groceries, reorganizing our fridge and telling me I was buying the wrong brand of cereal. For Jake, she knew his favorite everything better than I did and she made sure I knew it. The worst part was how she'd interrogate me about our relationship. She'd corner me in the kitchen while Jake was in the bathroom and ask stuff like, are you two using Protection and how often do you fight? When I told her, It wasn't her business. Get this hurt look and say I'm just looking out for my baby brother. Jake always defended her. He'd say I was being sensitive and that Becca just cared about us. But it got worse. After we got engaged 6 months ago, Becca demanded to see our bank statements because she needed to make sure Jake was making smart financial decisions. She wanted to approve our wedding venue, our guest list, even my dress. When I said no to helping pick my wedding dress, she cried to Jake about how I was shutting her out of important moments. Last month was the breaking point. Jake and I had our first real fight about money. Nothing crazy, just normal couple stuff about whether to buy a new couch or save the money we.

My girlfriend said I need space. Let's just be friends. I replied, sure. Then I removed her name from joint subscriptions, reclaimed her car keys and changed our Netflix password. 72 hours later, she was knocking desperately on my door. Part two, the last week has been a master class in escalating entitlement and delusion. I feel like I'm a character in a movie I never auditioned for. The 48 hour deadline came and went. Aura didn't call, didn't text, just silence. So as promised, I called a locksmith and had the locks on my apartment changed. It cost me $250, but the peace of mind was priceless. I also installed a small discreet security camera in my living room pointing at the front door. A little voice told me it would be a good investment. That little voice was right. The day after I changed the locks, the first dirty trick happened. I got a call from my credit card company's fraud department. Apparently someone had tried to report my car as stolen. They went through the automated system, but because some security questions were answered incorrectly, it was flagged for review. I confirmed the card was in my possession and they added extra security notes to my account. Trick No. 2 was far more serious and happened two days later. I got a calendar invite for a mandatory meeting from HR. The subject was just follow up conversation. My boss, Mark and a woman from HR named Susan were on the invite. My stomach twisted into a knot. I walked into the small conference room and they were both there looking serious. This wasn't going to be a casual chat. Susan started, her voice neutral and professional. Thanks for.

My brother Joe and I have always been close, but not because we're similar. It's because our parents made it so damn clear who they actually cared about. Joe has a twin sister, Jill, and our parents have always treated her like she's royalty. They wanted a daughter so bad they practically forgot Joe existed. Jill got the attention, the shopping trips, the praise. Joe got ignored. So I stepped in. I started doing little things for him, taking him out with my friends when Jill went on her mall princess adventures, cheering him on at school plays while our parents skipped out for one of Jill's glittery pageants. First it was just pity. But over time, I realised something. I actually like Joe. He's real funny, grounded. Meanwhile, Jill's grown into this bratty, entitled, can't be bothered drama machine. Now they're both graduating. Jill's heading to some fancy school in San Francisco, fully funded by Mommy and daddy, of course. Joe got into a school near me in Seattle. He earned a full ride scholarship. You'd think that'd make our parents proud, but no, they're using it as an excuse to not give him a single cent. You know, K, oh, you got a scholarship, cool. Figure the rest out on your own. So I called a few people while on Facetime with Joe, trying to help him line up a decent job for the fall, He's better off not being financially tied to our parents anyway, that with their money comes their control. He started to feel better, like he wasn't complete, completely screwed. And then the next day, Jill starts blowing up my phone. Apparently she overheard the whole thing, starts demanding I help her find a job, too, because she doesn't wanna hear dad nagging her about money. I told her politely that I don't know anyone in SF. She's better off just asking our parents. That's when she lost it, called me out for favoring Joe over her, said I was picking sides. And honestly, yeah, I am. I don't even deny it anymore. Joe deserves someone in his corner. Jill has everyone else. She doesn't need me.

A year after my wife died, my nine year old daughter Lily finally tried to play soccer again. Do you think mom can see me from heaven, she asked. I told her, absolutely. The team coach, Bradley Morrison came, highly recommended, two time regional championships, played D1 college, ran summer camps for elite players. During tryouts, he shook my hand firmly and said all the right things about building character through sport. But something felt off when he barely looked at Lily during introductions. And during the first and second practice, Lily never left the bench. Same with the second and third. By Game 2, when she sat there for 90 minutes straight while other girls rotated positions, I figured it was just some sort of misunderstanding. So as soon as practice ended, I approached Morrison. He immediately pulled me aside to where no one could listen. Mike, can I be straight with you, he asked. His tone was harsh. I nodded. I've been coaching for 15 years. Children from broken homes, single parents, divorce, death, it creates weak players. Playing time goes to kids from intact families. She lost her mother, I exclaimed. Rage boiled my blood. I literally couldn't process what I was hearing. Exactly my point, he said, while shrugging. I wanted to tear him a new one, but I couldn't because Lily was staring at me from the car wide eyed and hopeful. So I channeled my rage into something productive that Weekend I posted on the community Facebook page, free soccer skills clinic every Saturday morning. All kids are welcome, no experience needed. The response was immediate. Turns out Morrison had quite a few bench warmers. Kevin, whose parents just divorced. Maria, living with her aunt while her mom was in rehab. By the third Saturday, we had 28 kids showing up to Lincoln Park. I taught them everything I remembered from Sarah's old playbooks, basic drills, footwork, but mostly just let them play. By Week 4, our Saturday group had grown to almost 40 kids. What started as a simple skills clinic became something bigger. These kids were finding their confidence again. Words spread through the soccer community. Parents started asking why so many kids from Morrison's team were attending outside training. Some even pulled their kids from his team entirely.

I climbed up onto my roof, slid my window open as quietly as I possibly could, and right as I stepped inside, my light turned on. I almost had a heart attack and screamed as I saw my dad sitting in my room waiting for me. I could immediately see he was pissed. Fun night, he said. He had my iPad open, showing all the text messages between me. Embarrassed, but also knew I was done for. Dad spent the entire next day installing motion sensors on every door and window. Sync to his phone so he'd get an alert anything opened after ten PM. Mom changed the hiding spot for my phone three times, finally settling on locking it in their bedroom safe. You've lost our trust completely, Maya. She kept saying. You're not doing doing this anymore. What if you get pregnant? I tried to explain we didn't do anything, but they told me I was on complete lockdown for a month. No phone, no friends, no leaving my room except for school and meals. I'm not that good at reading, so I literally spent the entire week staring at the ceiling wondering what Brody was doing. My best friend Chloe lived three houses down, and I could see her bedroom light flickering as she probably scrolled Through TikTok or Facetimed. Our other friends. Without my phone, I had no idea what was happening in anyone's life. I, I begged my parents for it back, but they didn't care one bit. But then Friday came. I was looking out the window and saw Brody in Chloe's backyard. I instantly started fuming. I wanted to jump out and go yell at him right there, but my parents would kill me. But then came my perfect opportunity. As I was crying, my dad knocked on my door. He told me he and mom were going out to dinner, and they'd know if I left. You are not to leave your room.

Growing up, I wanted to be just like my mom, even if that meant being sold at 16, bred like livestock and learning to smile when my husband brought home other women's perfume on his clothes. My mother taught me these things were badges of honour, proof that we were good women who understood our place in the world. She would sit me down at her vanity mirror and brush my hair while telling me stories of my grandmother who raised 14 children from three different women her husband kept and how she never once complained or showed jealousy because that was weakness. When I turn 16, my parents arranged my marriage to a 23 year old doctor and I felt chosen, special and better than my cousins who were matched with farmers and merchants. My mother cried happy tears at the ceremony while whispering in my ear that I was fulfilling my destiny, that my grandmother would be so proud to see me continuing our family's legacy of strength. The wedding night came with pain that made me bite through my lip. But my mother had warned me this was normal, that the blood on the sheets was proof of my purity and worth. My husband was kind compared to what I've been taught to expect, never raising his hand to me, never forcing himself on me after I got pregnant with when our parents demanded grandchildren immediately and we complied. Because that's what good children did. But after five encounters that left me sobbing into my pillow, he promised never to touch me again if I didn't want it. I thought this made him the best husband in the world. And I told my mother about his kindness, how lucky I was that he respected my wishes. She smiled and said I was blessed that most men wouldn't be so understanding. When we moved to Canada after I turned 18, he asked my permission to see other women for his needs. And I grant did it proudly, thinking this made me enlightened and mature. My mother had done the same for my father. My aunts all knew about their husband's arrangements. So I called my mother to tell her how well I was handling marriage. She praised me for being so wise, understanding that men had needs wives couldn't always fulfill. The jealousy was a poison that destroyed families. Every Friday night, he would leave after putting our sons to bed and I would clean the house and feel accomplished like I was winning at being a wife. And Covid arrived and changed everything. I got so sick I could barely breathe. And for over a month, he became someone I'd never seen before. He held my hair when I vomited, changed my sheets when I sweated through them, sang Lullaby.

Living off our parents at 30, dating this girl who thinks she's too good for everyone. When she said his name was Logan, my blood ran cold. When she showed me his Instagram, there was Britney posing with my replacement life. Wait. Hey, Lily said. Noticing my reaction, you know them? I told her everything. Instead of being upset, Lily started laughing. Oh, my god, you're that Noah. Britney talks about her boring ex who became a doctor at every family dinner. She has no idea we're together.

The revelation came during what was supposed to be a Celebration dinner at my childhood home, where I'd planned to share my exciting news about finally achieving homeownership at 28. Instead, I walked into a nightmare orchestrated by the people who were supposed to love me most. My sister Jessica sat at the head of the dining table like she owned the place, her husband Mark beside her, with their twin boys climbing all over the furniture while my parents beamed at them like they just announced the cure for cancer. The moment I stepped through that familiar front door, Jessica's eyes lit up with malicious glee as she announced, mom and dad have the most wonderful news about your little house situation, Emma. The words hit me like ice water as my mother clasped her hands together, practically vibrating with excitement. Oh, Emma, we've solved everything. Jessica needs more space for the boys, and since you bought that house all by yourself without even asking our opinion, we figured you must not really need our help or approval for anything. My father nodded approvingly, completely oblivious to the trap they just walked into. We told Jessica's family they could move in with you next month. It's perfect. You'll have help with the mortgage, and the boys will have a yard to play in. Family should stick together. After all, the Crystal wine glass in my hand trembled as Jessica leaned back in her chair, savoring every second of my shot. What none of them knew was that they just made the biggest miscalculation of their lives. And I was about to show them exactly what happened when they under

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the centre of attention for 5 minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance, Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day, the one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding, I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up, he said. And I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself and I just can't deal with that stress on my wedding day. The line went quiet for like 10 seconds and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now you're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. She's basically family. I tried To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice. Hope think he changed his mind? He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, he says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted like 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewellery. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today with a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. She's coming anyway, Madison.

Two nights before my wedding, Marcus and I were sitting on our apartment floor folding programs and sipping wine when he said so casually, tomorrow night my father needs to examine you. I blinked. Sorry, what? He looked at me like I'd forgotten the salad for dinner. It's a family tradition. My brothers and Uncle Roberto will be there, too. Just takes a few minutes. I laughed because what else do you do when someone says something that insane? Marcus wasn't laughing. His face stayed dead serious. He reached for my hand, started rubbing circles in my palm like he always did to calm me. It's how we make sure the bride is pure, he said. I couldn't wrap my head around it. We were sitting in our candlelit apartment, rsvp cards and neat stacks. Honey Moon to Santorini already booked. And now he wanted his dad to inspect me with witnesses. I asked if his mom had done it. He nodded. Every woman who marries into the Castano family does. My mom, Maria, all my cousin's wives. It proves your love, shows your honest. That was the moment the warmth I'd felt from his family flipped into something colder than ice. His mom, the woman who comforted me when my grandma died, who taught me how to make her Sunday sauce, she went through this. I yanked my hand away. No, that's not happening. He looked crushed. Like I just told Him I cheated on him or something. You don't understand, he said. It's not some violation. Tradition verification, just five minutes, then it's done. Now I understood why he'd insisted we wait. I thought it was sweet. Turned out it was about preserving me like some ancient relic, so I could be verified by his dad.

So I replied, I agree, your stuff will be on your porch in an hour. Her response was desperate and confused. Wait, it was just a joke. But I was serious. I was at my desk when my phone buzzed. Alexis, Ryan, I think we should break up. This isn't working anymore. Most guys would panic and start frantically calling, but I felt pure relief, like I just sat down a weight I've been carrying for months. This wasn't the first time Alexis had pulled this move. This was her specialty. When she didn't get her way last month because I couldn't take a random Wednesday off work for her friend's party, maybe we're just not compatible. Before that, because I suggested we split her 300 dollar birthday dinner. I guess I know where I stand with you now. Each time I begged, blamed, reassured her promise to do better. Each time she'd graciously forgive me like she was doing me a massive favor. I just need to know you care, she'd say with those fake tears. The pattern was predictable. Something wouldn't go her way, she'd threaten the relationship. I scramble to fix it, repeat. But this time I typed back, I agree your stuff will be on your porch in an hour. The response was immediate. My phone started buzzing. Wait, what? Followed by Ryan, that's not what I meant. And crying emojis. Then came the kicker. I was testing you to see if you'd fight for us. Real boyfriends don't just give up that easily. There it was, the truth. She'd never admitted she'd been testing me. All those fights, all those threats were experiments to see how much control she had. Every. Maybe we should break up. With psychological warfare disguised as relationship communication, I drove home and packed her belongings, seven boxes and four garbage bags that had gradually taken over my.

I was dating this guy Mark for about six months when he finally introduced me to his 8 year old daughter Emma. He'd always made excuses about why I couldn't meet her. She was shy, going through a phase staying with grandparents. Red flags I ignored because I was falling for him. The first time I went to his house, Emma answered the door. She was this tiny, timid little thing who immediately apologized for existing. Sorry, sorry. I'll get daddy. Sorry for bothering you. Mark came to the door and didn't even acknowledge her. No hug, no how was your day? Nothing. He just disappeared upstairs like a ghost. During dinner, Emma asked quietly if she could have some ketchup. Mark exploded. You always want something. Can't you just eat normal food like a normal kid? This is why your mother left. I watched this little girl's face crumble. She whispered, sorry, daddy, and ate her plain chicken in silence while tears rolled down her cheeks. I tried to lighten the mood, asking Emma about school. Mark cut me off. She's not good at talking to people. Emma, go to your room. Adults are trying to have a conversation. She vanished again. I didn't see her the rest of the night. Over the next few weeks, I started noticing a pattern. Emma would try to exist quietly, but Mark treated her like an inconvenience he was stuck with. One day I came over. Early and heard him screaming at her upstairs. You're just like your worthless mother. Nothing but problems. I found Emma sobbing in her room, which was basically a storage closet with a mattress on the floor. No decorations, no toys, no signs a child lived there. The breaking point came during Emma's birthday. Mark forgot completely. When I reminded him, he got annoyed and said birthdays are just made up holidays to make kids feel special. She needs to learn the world doesn't revolve around her. I could.

She told me early on that her dad was a nightmare. Not just strict or distant, but the kind of man who made home feel like a prison. She never went into details, just that the day she left for college was the day she finally felt free. After that, she never looked back. Years passed. And then one day, her mom reached out. She said her dad had changed, but he regretted everything and wanted to make things right. My wife was skeptical, but her mom kept pushing, telling her he was a different man now. She wanted to believe it. I could see it in the way she hesitated when she talked about it. Eventually, she agreed to let him back in. At first, things were fine. He was polite, maybe even a little quiet. He brought over groceries, asked about her work, kept his distance. She told me he seemed softer, like age had worn him down. I wanted to believe that, too. Then one night, I came home from work, and everything fell off. The second I walked through the door, she was sitting at the kitchen table, arms wrapped around herself, looking smaller than I had ever seen her. She wouldn't look at me. That's when I saw them. Bruises. One on her arm, another dark and swelling along her cheekbone. I felt my stomach drop. I stepped closer. What happened? She shook her head. I don't wanna talk about it. I stared at her, waiting for her to say something, anything that would make this make sense. But she wouldn't even meet my eyes. I already knew. I turned and grabbed my keys. I found him at the same bar he always went to.

My grandpa started it from nothing, just a wrench, a truck and ridiculous work ethic. Now it's this big local empire, auto shops, property, even a commercial fleet. But since I was a kid, everyone said my cousin Nathan would take it over. He was the heir, the one with the polished handshake, the church smile, the button down shirts with his initials on the cuff. And me, I was hands on the grease stained. Stay out of the photos cousin. Didn't matter that I worked every summer there, Learned the books, showed up before the sun. If Nathan showed up once a month in a collard shirt, they acted like he was royalty. But I stayed quiet. I told myself, just work hard, it'll pay off. Then last year, Grandpa passed and suddenly everyone's talking succession. Nathan starts calling himself Next Gen CEO before there's even a will reading, starts inviting investors over to Grandpa's house. Post a photo of Grandpa's office with the caption, big shoes to fill, legacy continues. I snapped. I knew Grandpa better than anyone. I knew what he really thought about Nathan, the flashy spending, the fake smile, the way he dodged real work. So I went digging. One night I stayed late in the office, dug through Grandpa's old file cabinet, found something Interesting. A USB drive on it. A video Grandpa sitting at his desk filmed a month before he died. He starts talking, really talking. Not about Nate.

I then walk out of the store and report to the manager explaining everything I had stolen. I would do this so I could tell them the weak points in their security system and how they could potentially upgrade. They then pay me my base salary and I got to take home whatever items I had managed to steal as my bonus. I remember one specific day on the job I stole a full blown TV. I wanted to go to the manager and let him know his security system was the worst I had ever seen. I couldn't find it. So there I was walking around with a huge plasma TV in my arms with the price tag still on it, when one of the employees told me they last saw the manager sneaking out to the parking lot. And so I walked out too. The employee didn't even try to stop me, despite it being obvious I hadn't paid for the TV either way. I went down into the lot and when I did, I heard a woman yelping from across the lot. I followed the sound and what I saw made me gag. It was the manager I've been looking for. Getting some brain from A questionably legal looking employee. The worst part is that the girl refused to stop. I asked her to at least give me a second so I could talk to the manager, but she said no, she needed a promotion. And so I stood there with a huge TV in my hands and had a chat with the manager about how bad his security system was. All the while he was animalistically grunting with his pants down about how good this girl's head game was. And I'm ashamed to say it, but I developed a rager in the process.

You embarrassed me in front of my friends today. The sound of a slap echoed through the house, follow by my daughter crying. I ran up those stairs and burst through her bedroom door.

He threatened to kill himself if she ever left him. Told her that no one would believe her because he was so perfect. Felt completely trapped, especially with homecoming just three days away and the entire school expecting them to be crowned king and queen.

I was 23 when my family decided it was time for me to collect my first wife. They already had her picked out. My 13 year old cousin Fatima, whose mother bragged about her early development. You see, every girl in my family knew the rule. The day you get your first period was the day you got married. It didn't matter whether you still played with dolls or couldn't reach the kitchen counter. If you could bleed, you could breed. I was nine when I watched my oldest brother, Ahmed, get married to his first wife on his 21st birthday. She was 12 years old. By the time I was 15, Achmed had buried that first wife and was on to his third pregnancy complications. Everyone said your wife's youth was like a currency. Whichever man had the youngest, most obedient wife was the most praised in society. Family gatherings, my uncles would compete like kids comparing prizes. Amina was only 11 when I claimed her. Uncle Kareem would boast, holding up her photo. In response, Uncle Hassan would lean back, working. That's nothing. I got my Osman at 10 and she still had her baby teeth. The jewelry shop didn't even make wedding rings that small. For years, I played along, smiling when they discussed my future, agreeing that 14 was getting too old for a bride. Inside, my stomach turned. But what could I do? Speaking against it, Meant exile of you and all the women in the family. Three months before my wedding date, I found harifatima, my wife, to be in our family's utility room with a bottle of bleach. Her hands were shaking so bad she couldn't open it. When she saw me, she dropped to her knees. Please don't tell. Please. I can't. I know what happens. I've seen what happens. I took the bottle, sat on the floor next to her, and for the first time in my life, I said out loud, I know. I don't want this either. She sat there with her mouth wide open, staring at me like I had five heads. Suddenly, she lunged at me for a hug. Can you please tell them I'm crazy? Tell them I'm possessed or cursed. They won't want me if I'm insane. Bad blood ruins the lineage. That sentence changed everything. Because she was right. My family obsessed over bloodlines, genetic purity, producing perfect sons. Mental illness was the ultimate contamination. I'd seen them reject marriage proposals over rumors of a great aunt who talked to walls. Within a week, I taught Fatima to twitch at dinner tables, mumbling numbers in corners, scratching symbols on her arms with her fingernails. I coached her through episodes, taught her to roll her eyes back in gibberish, and claimed she saw demons in the wallpaper. She put on such an award winning act that sometimes even I was disturbed. My mother was horrified. She Was perfect. Two weeks ago, she wailed to my father. Now look at her. What if it spreads to the children? The wedding was quietly postponed. Words spread through the girl cousins like wildfire. My sister Amira, 14 and recently bloomed, came to me next. Then her friend. Nor then, nor sister. Before I knew it, I was running midnight coaching sessions in my car, teaching girls how to manifest madness. Dead eyes are crucial, I'd instruct. Stare through people, not at them. Laugh at nothing. Cry without reason. But timing is everything. Save the worst episodes for when marriage talks begin. Some girls were naturals. My cousin Layla developed a fictional friend she'd have full conversations with during family gatherings. She'd serve tea to empty chairs holding invisible children. Her father postponed three marriage proposals, terrified of producing defective grandchildren. Others needed more work. Soft spoken, Miriam couldn't sell the performance until I taught her to channel her real terror into fake hysteria. Think about your wedding night, I tell her. Now scream. The sound she made convinced everyone. But in six months, we had a full network. 15 marriageable girls, all displaying various forms of borderline schizophrenia. Family meetings turned to chaos as girls would trigger each other. One would start humming, another would begin rocking. Suddenly, three were speaking in unison about visions of black water. The elders panicked. They brought in healers who charged fortunes to wave incense around, doctors who prescribed sedatives, religious leaders who Performed exorcisms that left the girls even more convincingly traumatized. I thought we could maintain it indefinitely. The girls were protecting each other. Older ones coaching younger ones as they came of age. We had a system. And my family may have been PDF files, but they weren't stupid. So after a year of failed cures, they started noticing patterns. How the madness only struck marriageable girls. How symptoms peaked during wedding seasons. How I somehow was always nearby when episodes occurred. The final gathering happened on a Thursday. 23 of us were at my uncle's house for his daughter's engagement. The plan was to have her fake her worst episode yet. But when my uncle called her forward to receive her engagement blessing, she looked.

I might invest in some earplugs. It's not that bad. Stop it. But tomorrow should be the last day. Well, let me just say I'm excited to finally get some peace. Well, I'm glad. Anyways, I'm gonna get back to work talk tomorrow maybe. Uh oh my God, it's getting louder by the minute. Sorry, I'll tone it down a bit. Oh my God. What is it that you are doing that is so important but yet you can't tell me? Why do you need to know so bad? I don't need to know. I just wanna know because you are the only person making this type of noise in the complex. I'm surprised everyone isn't complaining about you and I told you I'm almost done. After that, you won't need to hear from me again. Oh my. Alright, just finish up. It's 8:00 you have an hour. Okay, and gosh, turn off that music. Sounds like a screeching cat. What? No way you can listen to that. I have to. You don't understand. You're so annoying. Okay. Today's the day you told me you would be finished. I will in a couple of hours. at least going to show me what the hell it is that you've been doing all this time? I could, but you have to promise not to make fun of it. Sure. I mean, I think I've already made fun of you enough. True. Alright, let me get back to work. I'll text you when I'm done. Sure. Alright, I'm done. Oh my God. Finally, this better be good and for a good reason. Otherwise, you annoyed me for nothing. Well, do you remember when I told you about my girlfriend? You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

When I was 12 years old, my mother slit her wrist in front of me because I asked to go to a friend's birthday party. And as she bled into our kitchen sink, she made me promise I'd never try to leave her again. She survived that time, barely. While the paramedics worked on her, she gripped my hand with bloody fingers and whispered, this is what happens when you abandon me. I spent three days in the hospital chapel, 13 years old and convinced. I almost murdered my mother by wanting to go to a sleepover. When she came home, arm bandaged and eyes hollow, she made me sleep in her bed so she could hold on to me all night. I need to know you're here, she said. Otherwise, the darkness comes back. The rules formed quickly after that. I couldn't join clubs because staying late at school feels like you're choosing them over me. I couldn't have friends over because their energy disrupts our bond. Each boundary came with the same threat, sometimes spoken, sometimes just a gesture toward her scarred wrists. She kept razors displayed on the bathroom counter like weapons, reminding me what would happen if I, I broke her heart again. By 14, I was homeschooled and completely isolated. Mom said it was better this way, just us two against a world that didn't understand our connection. She'd have good days where she'd braid my hair. And we'd watch movies and I think maybe this was enough. But then I mentioned wanting to learn to drive someday. And she'd go silent. She'd lock herself in the bathroom and I'd sit outside the door begging her to come out. She'd emerge hours later showing me fresh cuts on her thighs. Practice cuts. Call them for when you finally abandoned me for real. I attempted my first real escape at 15. I found a youth shelter address at the library and memorized it. One night while mom slept, I packed a bag and made it to the front door. But she was sitting in the dark living room waiting. I felt you pulling away, she said calmly. Then she swallowed an entire bottle of sleeping pills in front of me. I called 9 1 1 and rode with her to the hospital holding her hand while they pumped her stomach. When she woke up, she smiled sadly. You did this, she said, but at least you stayed to watch. After that, she installed bells on my bedroom door and windows. She test me randomly, pretending to hurt herself to see if I try to leave or just save her. I always chose to save her, but I was dying inside, suffocating under the weight of keeping her alive. I started writing goodbye letters I never send, hiding them in my textbooks. I tried to get away again when I was sixteen. Mom had fallen asleep after taking anxiety Medication. And I thought I had time. I made it three blocks before a police car pulled up. Mom had called them claiming I was mentally unstable. She'd shown them my hidden letters as evidence. As they drove me home, she texted me, if you'd kept going, you would have found my body when you came back. I had the bath ready that night. She showed me a new scar on her stomach. I did this while you were gone, she said. She made me help her bandage it, narrating how she would have cut deeper if I made it another block. Next time you leave, she promised, I'll make sure I time it perfectly. You'll be free, but you'll be a murderer. I became. I'm hyper vigilant, watching for signs she was spiraling. My entire existence became keeping her from the edge. When I caught her standing on our apartment balcony at 3:00am, I didn't ask why. I just took her hand and let her back to bed. But then I got a scholarship to art school. Mom found the acceptance letter before I could hide it. She didn't say anything, just disappeared into the bathroom. I heard water running and pounded on the door. When she finally.

I know that sounds weird coming from a white girl, but hear me out. This whole thing started about three years ago when I was living in Atlanta for my internship. My usual salon back home was like four hours away and I was desperate for a trim because my hair looked like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. My roommate, Keisha, was getting ready to head out to her salon and saw me struggling with my massive curls in the bathroom mirror. She, I just laughed and said, girl, come with me. My stylist will sort you out. I was hesitant because I'd never been to a black salon before. But honestly, my hair was so bad I would have tried anything. Walking into that salon was like entering a whole different world. The energy was incredible. Everyone was talking, laughing, music playing, kids running around while their moms got their hair done. It felt alive in a way that the quiet, sterile salons I was used to never did. The stylist, Miss Janet, took one look at my hair and shook her head, baby, who's been cutting your hair? Because they need to stop. She started running her fingers through it, asking me about my routine, what products I used, how I dried it. Nobody had ever asked me those questions before. They just wet it, cut it and send me on my way. Miss Janet spent two hours on My hair, two hours. She deep conditioned it, trimmed each curl individually, showed me how to scrunch it properly and sent me home with specific instructions about what products to use and how often to wash it. My hair looked better than it ever had in my entire life. But here's the thing that really got me. She charged me $40. 40. The salon back home charged.

My girlfriend had been nervous about introducing me to her family for weeks, warning me that her father built their ranch into one of the Southwest's premier cattle operations and didn't trust outsiders. I brushed off her concerns, figuring any family who raised someone as amazing as her couldn't be that bad. Fighting over some cattle ranchers seemed manageable for someone who'd grown up working his grandfather's ranch before heading to college. Anyway, the ranch sprawled across thousands of acres with cattle worth more than most houses, and her father's handshake could have crushed walnuts while his eyes cataloged everything from my soft leather shoes to my unmarked hands. The moment I mentioned working in marketing, his smile turned predatory. Marketing, huh? He said while looking me up and down. Well, I guess somebody has to make a living pushing paper while real men do actual work. The dismissal stung, but I forced to smile because this dinner meant everything to my girlfriend. Her father carved brisket while zeroing in on my supposed ignorance about their world. So you probably think steak comes from the steak tree and chocolate milk comes from brown cows, he said with a laugh that made my skin crawl. His brother joined in chuckling. Bet this city boy couldn't tell a bull from a steer if his life depended on it. Has he ever even seen a live cow before today? The family erupted in laughter at my supposed cluelessness about their world while I sat there like a museum exhibit. But I kept quiet because my girlfriend was already shifting uncomfortably in her seat. His wife turned it up a notch when she noticed me not saying anything. Oh my, look at those soft little hands! She cooed while refilling my glass, practically jiggling. I bet you've never lifted anything heavier than a briefcase, have you, sweetie? Do you get manicures, too? Most women don't even take that good care of their nails. Her sons were cracking up now, one adding between laughs, he probably uses more beauty products than his girlfriend does. The laughter felt like knives as they questioned my very manhood, but I swallowed my pride because causing a scene would only embarrass my girlfriend further. You know what kills me? Her dad continued, wiping tears from laughing so hard. Marketing coordinator probably makes, what, 25 grand? If he's lucky? That's what we pay our teenage ranch hands for summer work. The whole table was howling now as his brother added, our daughter could marry a successful rancher and live in a mansion, but instead she's settling for someone who will be renting apartments and driving used cars his whole life. She'll be clipping coupons while her friends are taking vacations. My girlfriend's face went crimson as her own family treated our future like a pathetic joke. He called me pale as a ghost and said I Probably weigh less than most of their calves. He laughed as he said, I'd probably never thrown a punch in my life. His eldest son was practically wheezing with laughter as he said, I look like a strong wind would blow me over. What really got to me was him telling everyone, what happens when our daughter needs a real man to protect her? Is he gonna bore the burglar to death with marketing statistics? The entire family dissolved into hysterics while I watched my girlfriend's face crumble. Her own family systematically destroying every aspect of my worth as a potential partner. Every instinct screamed at me to defend us both, but I bit my tongue because any reaction would only give them more ammunition. That's when a young girl burst through the back door screaming, daddy, something's wrong with thunder! His belly looks like a balloon! The men jumped up, but I was already sprinting toward the barn. My body operating on instincts buried for over a decade. Their million dollar bull

My girlfriend was so insane that she told everyone that we broke up because I cheated on her in her dream. She was a spoiled, rich girl who came from a terrible snobby family. They were the kind of people who would wipe their butts with hundred dollar bills if they ran out of toilet paper. If she and I ever got into an argument, she would run back to her daddy who would send her on a week long vacation to Cancun just so she could recover from our arguments. In one of these week long vacations to Cancun, she ended up getting pregnant from one of the six hotel staff she cheated on me with. But when she came back, instead of telling me, she told me that she was breaking up with me because she had a dream in Mexico that I would cheat on her point. I was so over the relationship that I didn't care if it ended. After I moved out and moved back to my parents house, I got a call from an anonymous number. When I picked up the phone, it was my ex girlfriend's father. He called to say, you broke my baby girl's heart, now I'm going to break your head. I'd sleep with one eye open if I were you. I told him whatever and for him and his crazy family to leave me alone. Truthfully, I was scared. I knew he had enough money to hire whoever he wanted to do whatever he wanted. When I applied for a new job, I noticed someone was watching me at the office. They weren't just watching me, they were staring. When I left the building, I saw them following behind. I started to look around and that's when I saw a black van with two men inside it also watching me. I've seen enough movies to know what that meant. So I didn't waste any time. I started running as fast as I could. I ended up running into a park where I found a police officer. I alerted him and told him that I was being followed by three men. I thought that he would help me, but instead he told me to put my hands behind my back and that I was being arrested. I demanded that he tell me why I was being arrested, but he told me to shut my broke ass up. The second he called me broke, I realized that this was all my ex's fault. I was doing, he paid the cop off to arrest me. At this point, I didn't even fight back. The cop put me in his cop car and just as I thought, he brought me to my ex girlfriend's estate. When he threw me out of the car, my girlfriend's father was waiting for me, sipping tea like a James Bond villain. I asked him if he was Going to take my life away. And all he said was, we need to talk. I followed him inside and passed by my girlfriend who was getting her feet done. Her father sat me down and there was trembling in his voice, my babe.

My boyfriend Jake and I had been together for like 8 months and things were going pretty well. Then one Tuesday morning I get this text from him that just says, I think we need to talk about us. This isn't working anymore. I literally felt my stomach drop. I'm sitting there in my pajamas eating cereal before work and this dude just dumps me over text. I tried calling him but it went straight to voicemail. I texted back asking if we could talk in person, but he left me on read. By lunchtime, I was convinced it was over. My coworker Ashley was like, girl, you need a rebound. But honestly, I wasn't ready for that. Instead, I did something way more impulsive. I drove to the animal shelter after work that same day. I've been wanting a dog for years, but Jake was always like, we're not ready for that responsibility. Well, guess what, Jake? Now I don't need your permission. There was this 3 year old golden retriever mix named Buddy who'd been there for two months. The shelter lady said his previous family had to give him up because they were moving overseas. He was the sweetest thing, just sitting there wagging his tail at everyone who walked by. I filled out all the paperwork and paid the adoption fee right there. Two hundred bucks later, I'm driving home with a dog. In my backseat. I spent the entire evening at Petsmart buying everything, dog bed, toys, food, bowls, leash, collar, the works. Dropped like $400. Easy. Posted a bunch of Instagram stories with Buddy, captioned them stuff like new roommate and fresh start vibes. I was actually feeling pretty good about the whole thing. The next morning, Jake shows up at my apartment with coffee and bagels from our usual spot. I open the door and Buddy immediately runs up to him, tail going crazy. Jake's face is just pure confusion. He's like, whose dog is this? And I'm like, mine, obviously. Then he gets this weird look and asks why I got a dog. I told him it was.

The first thing I noticed when I entered the patient's room was her deep sunken eyes and pale cracked lips. I approached her cautiously, remembering how the charge nurse warned the girl refused all male staff. We all knew what that meant. And she looked as broken as I imagined. I pulled up a chair next to her bed instead of standing over her and gently asked if she wanted some water first. She nodded. Sweetie, you're safe here, I said, keeping my voice soft like I do with my anxious patients. Male staff won't come near you, I promise. It's just us girls here. She looked at me for the first time and whispered, he's here. I asked who. And at first she refused to even say his name. I handed her my pen and clipboard. After a second, her hand moved. Percy. My blood boiled at the name. He was my everything, she finally whispered and started showing me photos on her phone of them together at college, confirming that it was the same Percy who was now a resident at the hospital. I did everything for him, everything. Her voice cracked as she swiped to screenshots of assignments, time stamps showing her submit his biochemistry homework at 3:00am, his pathology essays at 4:00am, his anatomy exams that she taken for him. She showed me his Instagram from those same nights, him doing beer pong And body shots with other girls while she was writing his thesis, this on cellular biology. The day after graduation, after I'd spent three years making sure he got into residency, he sent me this, she said, and handed me her phone. The text made me want to throw something. Babe, you're too clingy and it's honestly suffocating. I need to focus on my career without distractions. And honestly, doctors are supposed to date doctors and you're not one. We're done. Please don't contact me again. I waited until she was stable and sleeping before I stormed into the break room where three other nurses were charting. You guys are never going to believe what I just found out about Percy, I said. I told them everything and watch their faces go from confused to furious. And within 10 minutes, we had half the female staff crammed into that tiny break room. I knew something was off when he asked me to explain what antibiotics were said. June from pediatrics and Sydney are attending walked in right as someone said we should report him. And she closed the door behind her. Actually, I've been documenting his knowledge gaps for weeks, she said, pulling out her phone to show us pages of notes. But this explains everything. The room went quiet while we all looked at each other. And then Lida from the ICU said what we were all thinking, ladies, we don't need to destroy him. We just need to Let him destroy himself while we enjoy every second of it. The plan rolled out so naturally. It was almost beautiful to watch. Percy started getting paid for every.

When I turned 8, my parents threw me this huge party. All my friends came. We had a bouncy house, pizza, the works. I felt like the luckiest kid in the world. But right as we were about to cut my Ninja Turtles cake, my mom pulled me aside with this panicked look. Honey, we need to tell everyone to go home right now. Daddy is very sick and needs to go to the hospital. I was devastated. My friends left confused, some crying because they thought someone was dying. The bouncy house guy packed up while I sat there in my party hat watching my perfect day crumble. Dad spent three days in the hospital for what they said was a severe stomach infection. I felt so guilty for being upset about my ruined party when he was suffering. But this became a pattern. Every single birthday for the next 10 years, some crisis would strike right before or during my Celebration. When I turned 9, my mom got food poisoning an hour before my sleepover. When I turned 10, my grandma fell down the stairs during my bowling party. 11 was my dad's appendix acting up. 12 was our car breaking down on the way to the amusement park. By 13, I started having panic attacks before my birthday. I'd wake up wondering what disaster would ruin it this time. My friends stopped expecting invitations. Some parents whispered that our Family was cursed or unlucky. I began asking for quiet celebrations instead. Just cake at home, please. But even then, something always went wrong. The power would go out, someone would get injured. There was always something. When I turned 16, I didn't even want to party. I just wanted to go to dinner with my parents. But halfway through appetizers, my mom clutched her chest. I think I'm having heart palpitations. I started telling people I hated birthdays. Friends thought I was being dramatic. Just bad luck, they'd say. By 17, I was seeing a therapist for what I thought was birthday anxiety disorder. She kept asking about my family dynamics, but I defended them. They can't help that emergencies happen. When I turned 18, I didn't even tell them it was my birthday. I was planning to just let it pass quietly, maybe treat myself to coffee later. But that afternoon, I came home early from school and overheard my parents on the phone with my aunt.

Called her, calling the bank about early withdrawal penalties. When confronted, she claimed she was just gathering information for my future. But something felt wrong. Two weeks before my 18th birthday, I called the bank myself. The account was empty. All $40,000 gone. That night I confronted mom. She didn't deny it. Didn't apologize, didn't even look guilty. She just shrugged and said, Keith needed it more than you do. You can get loans, my grandmother's gift, my future, my trust, all sacrificed for a man who couldn't even get off our couch. Mom had chosen Keith over her own child's education. She kept talking and her words got crueler with each sentence. She said, I would understand when I found real love. She claimed she was teaching me that family makes sacrifices. Then she said the words that changed everything. Given you everything for 18 years, you owe me this. That sentence shattered whatever love I still felt for her. Keith walked in wearing a new gold chain and designer shoes. He smirked and put his arm around mom like he won a prize. That night, I heard them through the wall planning a cruise. They laughed about my reaction to the stolen money. Keith called me a spoiled brat and mom agreed. She said, I've been selfish since birth. I lay there realizing she would never choose me over any man. I remembered her years of tax fraud and her pride in cheating the system. That's when I knew exactly how to destroy her. I spent three months documenting Mom's cash business. I knew all her clients from years of her stories. I wrote down names, addresses and rates. She made at least $50,000 yearly. I found her income notebook and photographed every page. I researched IRS whistleblower programs and Confirmed family members were eligible the reward or could be 30% of collected taxes. I gathered her social media posts bragging about vacations and shopping sprees. I documented Keith's new lifestyle and match the dates to my stolen college fund. By the end, I had enough evidence to bury her in debt forever. I filed the IRS report online with all my evidence showing six years of unreported income totaling $300,000. I included the stolen college fund as additional unreported income. I attached every photograph, every social media screenshot, every documented pattern of Keith's spending. The IRS moved faster than expected because my documentation was thorough and organized. Six weeks later, the audit notice arrived during Keith's birthday party. Mom had invited all their friends to celebrate at her house. She opened the official envelope while everyone watched, probably expecting a birthday card. Her face went from confused to white as she read the letter twice. Her hands started shaking. She excused herself.

Moment where you knew you would win. I hated group projects more than anything in college. Every single time I'd end up doing all the work while everyone else just showed up for the grade. So when Professor Williams assigned our final ethics project worth 30% of our grade, I swore things would be different this time. The professor randomly put me with three students I barely knew, Alex, Jordan and Sam. I was actually excited because maybe working with strangers would mean they'd actually care about their grades. Boy, was I wrong. I made a group chat the same day and sent detailed messages about meeting times, dividing up the work and setting deadlines. Radio silence. I tried again the next day. Nothing. I even walked up to Alex after class and asked if he got my messages. He just shrugged and said, yeah, we'll figure it out later. Two weeks passed, a 20 page research paper was due in 10 days and nobody had written a single word. I kept sending messages, trying to set up meetings, offering to do video calls. They left me unread every single time. I had a choice. I could let our whole group fail or I could do what I always did. So I spent the next week pulling all nighters, researching corporate ethics scandals, writing analysis after analysis, adding proper citations and references, 23 pages of solid work. I was exhausted but proud. When I submitted it online, I Only put my name on it, not theirs, just mine. The very next morning, the day before our presentation, my phone started buzzing like crazy. Alex was calling me over and over. When I finally picked up, he sounded panicked. Hey, Maya, we're all ready to present now. Just make sure you add our names back to the title slide before class. Okay? I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Add your names back. You guys didn't help write anything. Come on, don't be like that. We're a team. Just put us on there. I hung up. 20 minutes later, Sam was knocking on my dorm room door, acting all friendly like we were best friends. Maya, hey, we just wanna make sure everything's good for tomorrow. We can all present different sections. What sections did you write? I asked. Well, we didn't technically write them, but we can present them. That's basically the same thing, right? I told her no and close the door. That's when things got ugly. They emailed Professor Williams that same night, claiming I had excluded them maliciously from the project and refused to collaborate. They said I was trying to take all the credit for work they had done. They even said I deleted their contributions from the shared document. Professor Williams replied to all of us the next morning. He said there would be a hearing after class where each person would be graded individually based on what they could prove they contributed. When I walked into the classroom for our presentation, my three group members were already there with printed papers and fake concerned expressions. They had actually printed out what looks like rough drafts with their names on them. During the hearing, they went first. Alex claimed he had written the entire introduction and that I had deleted it and rewritten it in my own words. Jordan said he had researched all the case studies, but I had stolen his work. Sam said she had done the conclusion, but I had cut her out completely. They showed Professor Williams.

The school called me during a client meeting. Your daughter won't stop crying. We need you here now. My stomach dropped. Maya never cried at school. She was my tough girl who scraped her knee last month and asked for a Spider Man Band Aid while blood ran down her leg. I left my presentation half finished and drove like the world was ending. The secretary's face was pale when I walked in. She pointed down the hall without speaking. That scared me more than the phone call. Maya sat curled in the corner of the nurse's office, arms wrapped around her knees. Her favorite purple dress was torn at the shoulder. The butterfly hair clips I'd put in that morning were gone. When I touched her arm, she jerked away like I was made of electricity. Baby, what happened? I whispered. She wouldn't look at me, just kept staring at the wall with empty eyes. The nurse shifted uncomfortably and told me Maya hadn't said a word since PE class ended. Missus Johnson brought her in like this. I took Maya home. She sat in the back seat, not her usual spot next to me. That night she wouldn't eat her favorite Mac and cheese, wouldn't watch cartoons, just sat on her bed holding her stuffed elephant while helping her into pajamas. I saw them finger shaped bruises on her upper arms, dark purple marks where someone had grabbed her hard My hands shook. Maya, who did this? She finally looked at me. Her voice came out so small. Mister Garcia said, if I tell, he'll hurt you. He said, nobody believes little girls anyway. Mister Garcia, the PE teacher parents loved because he coached the winning soccer team, the one who high fived kids in the hallway, who'd been teaching for 15 years. I called 9 1 1 that night. The female officer who interviewed Maya was gentle, patient. Maya told her everything, how Mister Garcia took her to the equipment room during class, how he made her play a secret game, how it hurt, how he did it to other girls, too, during their special practice time. The principal called me at 6:00am not to apologize, to scold me. He said I should have come to him first, that calling police was premature, that Mr Garcia was a valued member of their community. I recorded the entire call.

Okay, listen. My nine year old daughter Chloe is cute, but don't let the dimples fool you. Chloe is pure chaos in a Disney Channel body. She's funny, sneaky, and I swear she came out the womb with Wi Fi because she knows everything. It started on a Saturday morning. She asked for my iPad. Totally normal. Usually she just watches slime videos or those weird kids prank their parents TikToks. Ten minutes later, she storms into the kitchen yelling, Mom, Daddy's cheating on you! With Pop Tart crumbs flying out her mouth. I almost dropped the pancake pan. I'm like, excuse me. She flips the iPad around like it's evidence in a trial and goes, look, he's calling Miss Candy Babe. And yep, there it was. Text synced from his phone. Hearts, kissy emojis, even a sweaty gym selfie. I tried to stay calm, but she's staring at me like Judge Judy in pajamas. So are be divorcing him today or tomorrow? That night, I checked the iPad myself. Messages, pictures, everything. Dude was out here playing secret boyfriend while snoring next to me like a broken lawn mower. I didn't sleep, just sat. They're thinking my nine year old solved my marriage before coffee. Next morning, we're all at breakfast. He's buttering toast like nothing's wrong. My daughter looks him dead in the eye and goes, so how's your girlfriend? This man choked so hard on his bread. I thought I'd have to call 9 1 1. He stutters. What? Who? What girlfriend? She leans forward real serious and says, the one with cheesecake. The one prettier than mom. Then she bites her cereal like she just dropped a diss track. His face went ghost white. He looks at me for backup, and I just sip my coffee like it's a front row ticket to his funeral. He tries to change the subject, but my daughter doesn't stop. You know, mom deserves better. Should we fire him or demote him to maid? This man snapped, you shouldn't be in adult business. And she goes, then stop texting Miss Candy on the family icloud, dummy. I almost spit coffee all over the table. She said it with that little evil grin, like she'd been waiting her whole life for this. After he stormed off, I sat her down. I'm like, sweetie, you can't just explode people's lives like that. And she goes, why not? He exploded yours first. I had no comeback. She was right. My nine year old was smarter than me. Couple days later, I finally confronted him. He did the whole guilty husband monologue. It was just texting. It didn't mean anything. You're overreacting. And I just pulled out the screenshots my daughter saved. Yes, saved. She made a whole photo album labelled dad the liar. She even added little captions like Cotton 4K at eight thirty two PM. This child is an FBI agent in Light up sneakers. He started packing that night. Suitcase wide open, socks flying everywhere. My daughter sat on the couch, swinging her legs, eating Doritos, and shouted, Bye, Felicia! I almost died laughing. He glared at her, but what was he gonna do? Ground her for exposing him? Please. And here's the thing. My daughter didn't even stop there. Two days later, when he came by to talk, she opened the door, looked him up and down, and yelled, mom! The trash took itself out. Slammed the door right in his face. I had to go hide in the bathroom because I was laughing so hard, I couldn't breathe. So, yeah, my life flipped upside down. But my daughter turned into my partner in crime. She's wild, she's loud, and she's the reason I didn't stay with a liar. A week later, Miss Candy texted me, sorry, didn't know he was married. And before I could even reply, Chloe grabbed my phone and wrote back, it's okay, girl. We divorced him. You want custody every other weekend. I swear, I screamed.

Mom's eating breakfast, scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading Life 3, 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work part time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest, she says. If we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear, which sounds like something a dictator would say. But whatever. She makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realize immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3, 60 doesn't just show where you are. It shows your speed when driving, your phone battery, and sends notifications for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day. Well, dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect. Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says, no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she's shopping or at the doctor's. Whenever dad asks where she is, men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realize she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom checked your location. While I'm at school, dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realise she's literally sitting there refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day three, mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 in a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit, which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses a client worth $2,000. Week 2, she sees I stopped at McDonald's for 3 minutes and lectures me about wasting money, which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for 4 hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and asks her four hours at one store? And mom glares at me like I should have warned her he was checking but how?

Like, I'd already be imagining a life 20 years down, the life without a mother. I'm pacing around the house like a detective in a Netflix crime DOC. I'm checking the driveway every 10 seconds like I'm waiting on a pizza delivery, looking out the blinds like I'm in a hostage situation. And then when it hits seven, that's when the full panic sets in. I'm googling what to do when your mom is missing, but you're only 11 years old. I was seconds away from calling 9 1 1, like, hi, yes, my mom went to Walgreens and hasn't returned. It's been one hour. I think she got abducted. And it was always the most dramatic thoughts, too. I'd be like, okay, what if she crashed? What if I'm an orphan now? Who's gonna cook dinner? Who's gonna sign my field trip form? Am I gonna be one of those kids on the morning announcements they ask you to pray for? Then she finally walks through the door like, oh, sorry, I saw Aunt Lisa at the store, and we started talking. Girl, I was planning your funeral. I already picked the music. You can't just casually hit me with I ran Into someone. Follow.

But her face immediately dropped when she realised that we tricked her. My sister in law Maya has always been competitive with me, since the day I married her brother Jake. She couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me, and from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd de flesh, she'd push harder. Come on, just give me a hint. Then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nursery and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail. When she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages, desperately searching for any evidence of Our name decision. My husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use it first. She wouldn't do that, he said, but I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created bacon interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with final decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya I came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition. And I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think? She'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived! The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to her Surprise!

Thank you for the food, and I would thank you even more if Grandpa gets us ice cream for dessert. And liberty and justice for all. Amen. Along with the laughter from the other customers nearby, I heard a woman remark, that's what's wrong with parenting these days. Kids today don't even know how to pray. Asking god for ice cream, why I never? Hearing this, my grandson burst into tears and asked me, did I do it wrong? Is god mad at me? So, after I assured him that he had done a terrific job and that god was certainly not mad at him, an elderly gentleman approached the table. He winked at my grandson and said, I happen to know that god thought that was a great prayer. Really? My grandson asked, cross my heart, the man replied. Then in a theatrical whisper, he added, indicating the woman whose remark had started this whole thing, too bad she never asks god for ice cream. A little ice cream is sometimes good for the soul. Naturally, I bought my grandchildren ice cream. At the end of the meal, my grandson stared at his ice cream for a moment, and then he did something I will remember the rest of my life. He picked up his sundae. And without a word walked over and placed it in front of the woman. With a big smile he told her here, this is for you. Shove it up your ass, you grouchy old bitch

There were a lot of students who got away with cheating by wearing headphones during tests, so she was constantly checking. Since then, she didn't do anything too bad until we had to take our final exam at the end of the year and she stood up to walk around the room. It was really hot that day, so I wore a lighter shirt. I also happen to have type 1 diabetes. You could see my insulin pump that day. My blood sugar was low, so I turned my pump on and walked into class. We were almost done taking the test and she stood up to walk around the room. I was honestly focused on just passing until I heard her walk straight up behind me. In that moment, two things happened.

This year I decided to test something two weeks before my birthday. I started dropping hints everywhere. I left my birth certificate on the kitchen counter. I circled February 14th on the calendar with a big red heart. I even mentioned it during dinner. My birthday is coming up soon, I said while we ate tacos. He just nodded and kept scrolling his phone. The week before I got more obvious. I showed him a dress online and said this would be perfect for my birthday dinner next week. He mumbled something about it being nice And went back to watching TV. Three days before, I literally said, so what are we doing for my birthday Thursday? He looked confused and asked, what's Thursday? When I told him it was my birthday, he slapped his forehead like he always did and said, right, yeah. I've been so busy with work stuff. Thursday morning came. I woke up expecting something. Anything. Maybe flowers by my bedside or breakfast in bed. Nothing. He got dressed, kissed my cheek, and said he'd be back late because of a client dinner. Not even a happy birthday. I sat there in my pajamas until noon, feeling stupid for hoping things would be different this year. Then I remembered something. His birthday was exactly one month later, March 14th. And for the past four years, I'd thrown him surprise parties, bought expensive gifts, took days off work to plan special celebrations. That's when I made my decision.

I had an eight year old diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Without insulin, she'd be dead in six months. I called the mother in to explain the situation. When I, I told her, she was totally relaxed. Oh, I know about the diabetes. The other doctor mentioned it last week. We're handling it naturally, though. No insulin needed. I thought I misheard her. Your daughter needs insulin to live. Her pancreas doesn't work anymore. She will die without it. The mother smiled. We're doing carrot juice therapy instead, 60 ounces a day. Diabetes is just toxin build up in the pancreas. The juice flushes it out. She said it like she was explaining a recipe. I tried showing her the test results. Her blood sugar is 680. She could slip into a coma any moment. The mother stood up and helped her daughter to her feet. Well, thanks for your opinion, but we're good. The carrot cleanse takes three weeks to work fully. We're only on week two. I blocked the door. You can't leave. She's in diabetic ketoacidosis. She needs emergency treatment. The mother laughed. This is why people don't trust doctors. You create fake emergencies. Move or I'm calling security on you. She pushed past me with her barely conscious daughter. After she left, I immediately called my supervisor and hospital legal. We needed an emergency ethics meeting. A child was going to die within an hour. We had social services, the chief of pediatrics and legal on a conference call. The mother had been flagged at three other hospitals. Each time she left when doctors mentioned insulin. I explained the situation. She's giving her type 1 diabetic daughter only carrot juice. The kids in active ketoacidosis. She'll be dead in weeks, maybe days. Legal said without immediate danger, we couldn't force treatment. The chief suggested we call the mother for a formal care meeting, make it sound routine. When I called, she was surprisingly cheerful. Oh, a second opinion? Sure. I love educating doctors about natural healing. She came back that afternoon with a rolling suitcase. Inside were printed Facebook posts, blog articles and a Powerpoint on her laptop she set up like she was giving a business presentation. Let me show you how Big Pharma created the die diabetes lie. She actually had slides. Slide 1, Insulin is made from GMO bacteria. Slide 2, diabetes didn't exist before 1920. Slide 3, every culture has a vegetable that cures diabetes. Chief of pediatrics interrupted. Ma'am, your daughter's blood sugar was 680. She's dying. The mother clicked to her next slide. That's exactly what they want you to think. Look at this graph I made. Couple days later, the school called 9, 1 1. The daughter had collapsed in the cafeteria, completely unresponsive. When they arrived, I recognized her immediately. The orange tinted skin was unmistakable. Blood sugar was 1,100. She was in a diabetic coma. The Mother rushed in 20 minutes later carrying her suitcase of documents. She fainted because they gave her school lunch instead of her juice. That processed food is poison. The kids started seizing right there on the gurney. Foam.

My younger sister, Ariana turned into a homewrecker the moment my husband Kevin, slipped the ring on my finger and started a desperate pick me routine. If Kevin were blue, she'd show up in blue. If you mentioned liking something, she'd become an expert overnight. If you posted about a restaurant, she coincidentally appeared during our date. It started subtle, almost innocent, even like sitting next to Kevin at every family dinner, Ariana would squeeze between us, claiming she couldn't hear from the other end. I didn't mind since family is family. But after six months, it got obvious. Kevin joined a gym near his office. Ariana got a membership there the next day, showing up during his workout times in tiny sports bras. Kevin mentioned liking astronomy once. Suddenly, Ariana was texting him NASA articles daily, asking, can you explain this to me? Then came the fake emergencies. Her car broke down near Kevin's office. Her apartment had a gas leak when I was out of town. She needed help moving heavy boxes that turned out to be empty, Kevin always told me, immediately showing me her texts with eye rolls. She's just young and confused, he'd say. And I agreed until she officially went too far. A hard knock at 9:00am and there stood Ariana in a tiny white sundress, full makeup, hair curled like a magazine. Shoot, I need Kevin's help moving furniture, she announced, pushing past me. Where is he? But we both knew she lived in a furnished apartment. I was about to tell her to leave when she added, I'm sure you have errands to run. You can go away now. She was literally trying to dismiss me from my own home. Kevin came downstairs and she immediately grabbed his arm. Oh, perfect. You're already dressed. I promise I'll return him in one piece. She actually winked at me. I felt my chest burn with rage, but then had a different thought. I headed upstairs, loudly saying, I need to take a bath. But I didn't leave or go to the bathroom. I stayed upstairs where I could hear everything through the vents. Didn't waste any time. Oh, my God, Kevin, you're so muscular, she giggled, clearly touching his arm. Do you work out every day? I bet you could lift me with one hand. Wanna try? I rolled my eyes. This girl had zero shame. I kept folding laundry, waiting for Kevin's polite deflection. Instead, I heard him say, seriously, Ariana, can I tell you something important? My heart sank. Oh, god, here we.

Jess came over to my place Friday night and I could tell something was bothering her by the way she kept sighing. You know what Britney told me today? She said, flopping down on my couch. Her boyfriend is so mysterious and she's obsessed with him. Meanwhile, you texted me 12 times about being nervous for your presentation. The way she said it made me feel like I was some kind of burden. I wish you were more mysterious, more of a challenge. Should have known this would end badly when three weeks later she'd be crying at my door. But that night, I just felt hurt and said, fine, I'll be mysterious that night. I usually would have texted her good night, but I didn't and it felt wrong not doing it. She sent me three question marks right away and I just wrote back, all good and left it at that. Saturday morning came and normally I'd text her about my coffee and ask what she was up to, but I kept my phone in my pocket. Noon she was texting you okay and I just sent a thumbs up, which killed me because I actually wanted to talk to her. Monday was the worst because I got the promotion I've been working for and all I wanted was to call her and celebrate. When we went to dinner that night, she Asked about my day and I just said same old while scrolling through my phone, even though inside I was bursting to tell her. She leaned across the table trying to figure out what was going on with me. You seem different, she said. Good, different. And the crazy part was she seemed more into me than she had in months, which made me feel powerful but also completely hollow inside. The second week, she started showing up at my place without calling first and cooking these fancy dinners, basically doing anything to crack me open. I can't figure you out anymore, she said. Wednesday night and she sounded excited about it. Britney so jealous, she says. I got the mysterious boyfriend Jackpot. I wanted to tell her how dumb this whole thing was and how much I missed just talking to her normally, but I just shrugged and kept watching TV. my dad called because my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery and he was freaking out. I spent three hours calming him down while Jess sat next to me trying to figure out what was happening. After I hung up, she asked, is everything okay? And I wanted to fall into her arms and tell her everything, family, stuff. I said instead, it's handle. She kissed me harder than she had in months and whispered, you're so strong. But I wasn't strong at all. I was just pretending. The third, Thursday night at eleven PM Jess showed up at my door with her makeup running down her face, shaking.

My best friend Mike called me at 3:00am last Tuesday, voice shaking. I need to tell you something and I need you to listen. Without hanging up. We've been friends since middle school, so I knew something was seriously wrong. Remember that guy, Derek, who kept harassing my sister at work, the one who followed her home and kept showing up at her apartment? I remembered Derek was this creepy older guy who wouldn't take no for an answer. Mike's sister, Emma, had filed multiple complaints, but nothing stuck. Well, he's not going to bother anyone anymore, Mike said quietly. My blood went cold. What do you mean he's not going to bother anyone? There was this long pause where I could hear Mike breathing heavily through the phone. I was driving home from Emma's place last night around midnight. She'd been crying because Derek showed up at her work again, this time with flowers and a note saying he knew where she lived. I was so angry I could barely see straight. Mike continued. That's when I saw Derek's car parked outside her apartment complex. He was just sitting there in the dark watching her windows. I pulled over and walked up to his car. When he saw me, he started laughing and said Emma would come around. Eventually, I snapped. I dragged him out of the car and we started fighting in the parking lot. But then he. Hit his head on the concrete. When he fell, there was so much blood and he wasn't moving. I checked for a pulse, but there was nothing. My hands were shaking as I held the phone. Mike, please tell me you called 9 1 1. Another long silence. I panicked. I put his body in his trunk and drove his car to the old quarry outside town. You know, the one where we used to go swimming as kids? The car is at the bottom of the lake now. With Derek inside, I hiked back to my car and drove home like nothing happened. I felt sick to my stomach. This was my best friend, the guy who helped me through my parents divorce, who was the best man at my wedding. Mike, we need to call the police right now. This was self defense or at least manslaughter. If you explain what happened. No, he interrupted. They'll never believe me. A guy with Derek's background doesn't just disappear without someone looking into it. But if they find the car, I'm going to prison for murder. The next few days were torture. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn't look at my wife without feeling like I was keeping this horrible secret. Mike acted completely normal, even asking if I wanted to grab drinks that weekend. But something felt wrong about his story. Derek was a big guy, probably 200 pounds. Mike was maybe 150. Soaking wet. How did he drag A body that size and get it into a trunk by himself. And why would Derek be parked outside Emma's apartment when she moved to a new place across town two weeks ago? I started doing some digging. I called Emma and casually asked how she was doing with the Derek situation. Oh, that's been resolved for weeks, she said. My new boyfriend, Jake, had a talk with him and Derek hasn't bothered me since. When did this happen? I asked about three weeks ago. Jake used to play college football. And I think Derek got the message pretty clearly three weeks ago. But Mike said this happened last Tuesday. Then I remembered something else. Mike had been acting strange for months, not just the past week. Paranoid, jumpy, asking weird questions about loyalty and friendship. He'd been having money problems, too, something about gambling deaths. I decided to drive out to the quarry myself. If there really was a car down there, I needed to see it with my own eyes. When I got to the spot where we used to swim, the water was crystal clear. You could.

So I treated her exactly like I treat my other friends, with boundaries. Tara and I had been together for two years, living together for one. We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer where I was supposed to be her plus 1. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends, get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends but not amazing partners. Here's what killed me, she said. All this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay. You've already got an exit strategy. I said, we're adults, we're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies. Okay, I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. I treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7:00am. Could You drop off my work laptop? Sure, I'll leave it at the front desk of your office. Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. Got plans Monday works better. She didn't like that, but what was she going to say? We're just friends now. Week 2, Tara started cracking. She showed up at the apartment while I was at work, still using her key, helped herself to groceries, did laundry, took a shower. I texted her, I'll need the key back. My friends don't have keys to my place. This is ridiculous. We live together. We used to live together. Now we're friends. Different relationship, different boundaries. She came by that evening, furious. You changed the locks. You no longer live here. Here's a box of your stuff. I'm treating you exactly like I treat my friends. None of them have keys to my place. But I'm not just any friend. According to you, that's exactly what you are. The real kicker came at game night with our friend group. I showed up solo. She showed up with some dude named Connor from yoga, clearly trying to make me jealous. I shook his hand, welcomed him, then needed to destroy everyone at code names while paying them zero attention. Halfway through the night, Tara cornered me. You don't even care that I'm here with someone else. Why would I? We're friends. Friends date people. She couldn't answer because there was no answer that didn't Admit she wanted me to pine for her while she found herself. But the best part, her bestie, Marissa, had been extra friendly all night, kept finding excuses to talk to me, laugh at my jokes. This morning, Tara texted, what was that with you and Marissa? We were just talking. Friends talk. She's my best friend and I'm your friend, too, right? Friends can be friends with each other's friends. By week 3, Connor from yoga had ghosted Tara. Meanwhile, Marissa invited me to a comedy show. The date was fantastic. She was actually hilarious. Something I'd.

All of my bags are packed. I'm ready. Do you wanna come over to my house or meet at the airport? Um, babe, yeah, don't tell me you forgot. Um, not really, but I thought Ava already told you told me. What? Are you okay? Is anyone hurt? Um, this is kind of awkward, but since the house can have 6 people in Ava and I thought maybe this trip should be, you know, just for us, me and all our friends. Huh? And since it's my birthday, I think I should have fun. What are you even saying? I'm at the airport right now. Where are both of you at? Well, we're already on the airplane with all our friends. We're going to the cabin beach house. What? How many of you are there? And who are your friends? It's just me and Ava. Then four of her friends, Eric, Jamal, Tyrone, Leslie. What? Well, Ava was supposed to tell you. She's literally such a silly girl, babe. She definitely just forgot to tell you. Forgot to tell me what? That you won't go with us? And you're telling me this after I took a week? Off work, told my friends I'm going to a trip with my girl, then prepared for a surprise. I won't tell you on a trip that I fully paid for. Look, I'm so sorry, babe. All of my friends really appreciate you. We will love you. And they all said you're a great guy for this. They wanna hang out with you after this trip. I organized everything for both of us, me and you. I paid for everything. I only accepted Ava because you wanted her. Tell you're joking, please. And that is so, so generous of you. I didn't think it would bother you that much, to be honest, because I know you're not an insecure boyfriend. This has nothing to do with insecure. I wanted to spend time with you. I was going to propose on your birthday. Mia, how can you do this? I'm really sorry, babe, but you're always so serious. This was my birthday and I wanted to have fun, make stupid decisions and get wasted. If I went with you, we won't go to the club, we won't ever drink and we will just go to fun places and swim all day. I only live once, babe, and I want to make the most of it. Just because I don't drink, it doesn't mean I'll stop you, right? But sometimes you have to let it go. I wanna make very stupid decisions. I don't want you to spoil the mood for me. I'm Only 22. Once in a lifetime. Sorry, babe. But I will make it up for you when I come back. You can propose to me. We should go to another trip, just me and you this time. Have as much fun as you want. Visit all the fun places, eat and swim all day. I still like you as a person. Adam, hello. Are you there, Adam? Sure. Have fun. Hey, babe. We're at the reception.

Really. I have never heard a girl say that in my life. Hello. Hi. I was looking for Erica. Speaking. Erica, how are you? This is Jubal from Brook and Jubal in the morning. What? My name is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. It's a radio show, 6 to 10 in the morning, moving 9 to 5. How are you? I'm doing well. I'm, I don't really understand what's going on, though. Well, I'm calling you actually because you recently went on a date with a listener of ours. He really liked you. Yeah. But you're not calling him back. So he, he emailed us to give you a call and see if we could find out what the reason is really why you're not calling him back. His name is rich. Oh, yeah. So you, you remember meeting rich? He made an impression. Yeah. Okay. Rich told us about meeting you, had great things to say. He did say there was an awkward moment where you guys are back at his house, you're kind of making out or whatever, and then you got up and left. Oh, my God. He told you all that? Yeah. He didn't, he didn't like go into any details or anything. He just said you guys were hanging out at his place and it went in the bedroom and then you left. That's, that's it, though. Wow. Okay. Um, he hopes that he didn't do something to Scare you or creep you out or whatever. Like he would like to see you again. Is there anything that we can tell him? Um, I just don't. Erica, when we were talking to rich, I said that I think that he's a really weird moaner and like as soon as you guys started kissing, you just started moaning like crazy and you couldn't take it. Am I right? No, no, no. I thought for sure, you know, on that one. Yeah, I thought I did. I thought you nailed it nail on the head on that one. Is it more embarrassing than that? I don't think it's really embarrassing. Um, at least for him, I don't think it is. It was just something happened and I, I didn't know what to do and I just left. Can I tell rich why? Is there anything you can tell me just so I can go back to rich and be like, hey dude, this is the reason. Well, I mean, I'm sorry, I don't know you and I just, I don't even know him that well and, but do you think it's something that maybe he can learn from to not do again? Oh, well, it's, I mean, it's nothing he could change. Oh, so it's, he's stuck with whatever it is. Is it something that you were disappointed in? No, more like surprised, I guess the mean word. What is rich actually, Richard? Is he a woman? Is he a Woman or something? No, far from it. He's far from a woman. Alright, well, you probably like to know that, I guess. Yeah. Um, that's kind of a problem. What? That's the problem is that he's not a woman. He's too manly. No, no, no, not like that. No. What do you mean by that? Well, um, it's just too big. Really? Wow. Are you are you serious Erica? That's the reason you think what it was it was too much. I know it sounds silly or whatever, but like, yeah, I was just once I knew what I was working with, it just became clear she ran away from me. Really? Oh my God. No, Erica, I, I really appreciate you sharing that with us. So you are scared. Scared of what he keeps in his toolbox. The right word really? I just know that it wouldn't work. Oh god, really? Okay, can we get it like a, I don't know, relate it to something? No, that we're talking? I'm dying. I don't need to know Brooke. I don't feel comfortable saying anything more, but probably whatever you're imagining is right. Okay. Wow. Wow. Okay, well, rich is probably gonna be a little upset that you didn't wanna call him back. Really, I think that's the best reason to be turned out ever. That's what I was about to say. She's gonna be very excited to hear that news, Erica. Yeah, thank you for sharing. I should also let You know that rich is actually on the other line right now.

As she was coming back and handing it out to all of us, her bikini came undone, both boobs out and right in my face. I was riding that high for at least a week. 2. I was about 14 and at a water park waiting for my friends to change. They had doors on the changing rooms. And as I was sitting there, a changing room door slowly opened. A girl about 20 was fully naked and sliding down her panties. She looked up and we made eye contact. She smiled, winked and slowly closed the door. My friends all came out oblivious to what had just happened. And I had to walk with my towel in front of me for a long time. 3, I was visiting a friend and keeping an eye on her kids while she was taking a shower. Her daughter wanted my phone so much that I gave it to her and she ran off to the bathroom. The daughter asked her mom, who had just gotten out of the shower, to take a picture of her. I guess she came back and said, look at the picture Mommy took of me. What they didn't realize was that the daughter was Standing in front of a mirror when the picture was taken, I started rolling laughing and told her to go show her mom the picture again. The next sound I heard was her mom yelling, oh, my God, give me that. He better not have put you up to this. We were all completely innocent to this accident.

Turkish delight. All that Narnia bullshit for this. 2, fondant. Wanna ruin a cake? Cover it in fondant. 3. A friend sent me a package with snacks from the US once including Twinkies. I was so excited to try them only to get slapped with the most artificial, sugary, plasticish flavor I ever tasted. Meanwhile, Cheetos are peak, especially the flaming hot ones. 4, Dubai Chocolate. I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't even close to being good for all the hype it got. 5, crumbl cookies.

Salty fish, eggs on a cracker. You paid what for this? 7, those huge smoked Turkey drumsticks they sell at Renaissance fairs. The meat is like ham and every bite is full of ligaments and tendons.

They didn't realize they just declared war on 2,000 bored teenagers with nothing but time and spite. It started when Principal Morrison announced a new policy. Students caught sharing the cool Wi-Fi password will face immediate suspension. The password was 47 characters long, randomly generated every week and only given to teachers. My friend Marcus was the first to strike back. He brought a 30 foot Ethernet cable to cool and plugged directly into the computer lab wall. When Mr Morrison walked by, Marcus was sitting in the hallway, laptop connected, cable sneaking under the door. Marcus, what are you doing using wired internet, sir? The policy only mentions Wi-Fi. That cable is a tripping hazard. I put up caution sign. Marcus had indeed played tiny yellow wet floor signs every three feet along the cable. Mr Morrison updated the policy. No Ethernet cables over 6 feet. So Marcus brought six separate six foot cables and five friends. They formed a human chain, each person holding a laptop connected to each other, passing internet from the lab to the cafeteria like a digital bucket brigade. This is ridiculous, Mr Morrison said. This is compliance. Marcus replied, each cable is exactly six feet. New rule, no daisy chaining connection. That's when Jennifer got involved. She noticed the smart TV in the library was connected to Wi-Fi. She screen mirrored her phone to the TV. Then use the TV's browser to create a hotspot broadcast to her laptop. Jennifer, you're using the school Wi-Fi? No, sir, I'm using the TV's connection. The TV isn't a student. The TV doesn't need suspension threats, she added sweetly. Mr Morrison banned using school devices as intermediary. Alex took a different approach. He stood outside the teacher's lounge with a clipboard claiming he was conducting a password security audit for his computer science project. He'd ask teachers to write their password down to test memory pattern. 3 teachers actually did it before word spread. Alex, this is deception. This is social engineering research, sir. Very educational. Did you get the password? That would be unethical to reveal. Meanwhile, Sarah had noticed something beautiful. The attendance system auto connected to Wi-Fi when teachers logged in. She volunteered as an office aide and memorized the password as it briefly appeared on screen during setup. She didn't share it though. Instead, she sold a service. Bring her device, she'd connect it for you, then change your Mac address so it looked like a printer. By week 3, half the school was showing up as HP Laserjet on the network. Why do we have 400 printer? Mr Morrison asked it. Those aren't printers it, he replied. Then what are they? Creative student. The arms race escalated. Ryan figured out the password was always posted in the teacher's bathroom. Thinking students wouldn't see it there, he used a drone with a camera. During lunch when the bathroom Was empty. The footage was shaky but readable. Ryan, you flew a drone into school property, into the courtyard. Sir, the bathroom window was open. I was investigating ventilation efficiency for my environmental science project. Mr Morrison put curtains on the bathroom window. But the masterpiece came from quiet Emily. She noticed the school's old Wi-Fi routers were still broadcasting, just hidden from the network list. They'd forgotten to change those passwords. She connected to school Wi-Fi 2,015 with the password admin 1, 2, 3 and had faster internet than the teachers. Emily, that network was supposed to be decommissioned. Supposed to be isn't the same as was. Sir, how did you even find it? I didn't. My phone did. I have very aggressive auto connect setting. The breaking point came during standard eye testing week. The online test required internet, so they had to give all students the password. Within minutes, someone had shared it on a paper airplane that flew across the gym. Then another student wrote it in chalk on the trap. A third person trained the morning announcements kid to say it phonetically while reading the lunch menu. Chicken tenders, w 1 f 1 p at SS, mashed potatoes, w 0 r d, green beans 2 dash 0 dash 2 dash 4, chocolate milk, exclamation point, hashtag dollar sign. Mr Morrison called an emergency assembly. Fine, you win. We're going back to open Wi-Fi with content filter. The auditorium erupted. Then Marcus raised his hand. Mr Morrison about those content filters, don't just don't already found 17 ways around them. Of course you have. The next day the Wi-Fi password was, please just use selt responsibly, 2,024. Someone changed it to we promise wink, 2,024. Within an hour, Mr Morrison pretend did not notice. He was tired. The students had won and honestly, their grades had improved from all the technical research they've been doing. Sometimes the best victory is knowing when you've been outsmarted by 2,000 teenagers who turned your security system into their favorite class.

What's it like? My family lived by one rule, you pay what you owe, no matter the cost. So when I was 19 and found out my father had borrowed 200,000 from the Katzloff family, I knew our lives were over. My father sat at the kitchen table with his head in his hands while my mother paced and chain smoked. The deadline was three days away and we had nothing. Then Boris Katzloff himself showed up at our door with his son, Nikolai. Boris looked at me the way you'd examine a car before buying it. He turned to my father and said, your debt disappears tonight if she marries my son. My father didn't even look at me before agreeing. My mother just lit another cigarette and stared at the wall. The wedding happened in Boris's basement. No dress, no flowers, just papers to sign and men with guns watching. Nikolai was 28 and had dead eyes. After the ceremony, he leaned close and whispered, your currency, nothing more. Remember that? The abuse started that first night. He showed me a room in his house with no windows and a lock on the outside. He said that's where I'd live if I caused problems. He monitored my phone calls and read my texts. If I took too long at the grocery store, he'd show up and drag me out by my arm. He'd remind me what his family did to people who betrayed them, how they Made examples of entire bloodlines. He installed cameras in every room except the bathroom. When I showered, he'd bang on the door after exactly 10 minutes. He picked my clothes each morning and inspected me before we left the house. If my makeup wasn't right, he'd wipe it off roughly and reapply it himself. He weighed me every week and controlled my portions at meals. Every week we had dinner at Boris House. I had to sit silent while they discussed their business like I wasn't there. Drug shipments, territory disputes, names of people who wouldn't be problems anymore. Nikolai would rest his hand on my knee under the table, squeezing harder if I showed any reaction. His mother would smile at me and say things like, such a good girl, knows her place. My parents called once a month to make sure I was being good. They never asked if I was happy or safe. Just reminded me that my father's life depended on my cooperation. My younger sister wasn't allowed to talk to me because they didn't want her getting ideas. The breaking point came when Nikolai brought home another woman. He made me serve them dinner while they laughed and touched each other. When I dropped a plate he handed me in front of her, she laughed and said, is this the debt payment? She's not even pretty. That night while they were in our bedroom, I sat in the kitchen and realised I'd rather die trying. To escape than live another day as property. I started planning carefully. I saved grocery money and tiny amounts and hid cash and tampon boxes. I memorised bus schedules and studied maps during my allowed library time. I smiled more, acted docile, made Nikolai believe I was finally broken. It took six months to save enough for a bus ticket to another state. I practiced walking with different postures in the bathroom mirror and studied accents on YouTube videos during my supervised internet time. You belong to us, Nikolai had said once. There's nowhere we won't find you. The night I ran, I left during his poker game when he'd be distracted for hours. I took nothing but the cash and clothes I could layer. I've been putting sleeping pills in his vodka for weeks, tiny amount so he'd be groggy but not suspicious. At the bus station, I threw away my phone and bought a ticket with shaking hands. For 48 hours, I didn't sleep. Certain every stop would bring men with guns. I which buses three times and doubled back twice to confuse anyone following. In a truck stop bathroom, I cut my hair with stolen Scissors and dyed it black with a box kit. I traded my coat with a homeless woman and bought men's clothes from a thrift store. By the time I reached my destination, I looked nothing like the girl who'd fled. I ended up in a small mountain town where I got a Job washing dishes under a fake name for two years. I jumped at every car door slam and every Russian accent. I moved constantly, never made friends, worked jobs that paid cash. I Learned to spot surveillance, bury my roots and keep emergency bags packed. One day.

When mom married Garrett, I was 8 years old and desperate for a father figure. My biological dad had walked out when I was 3, leaving behind only a box of photos and unpaid child support. Garrett seemed perfect at first. He fixed our broken faucet, taught me to ride a bike and never missed my school place. But everything changed when my half brother Colton was born. Suddenly, I became the unwanted stepchild. Garrett would buy Colton expensive toys while telling me my allowance was earned, not given. At family dinners, he'd brag about Colton's first steps while dismissing my honorable achievements. When relatives visited, he'd introduce Colton as my son and me as my wife's daughter. The worst part was how he'd punish me for things Colton did. When Colton broke the living room lamp, I was grounded for not watching him properly when he drew on the walls, I lost my art supplies for setting a bad example. Mom never intervened. She was so grateful to have a husband again that she pretended not to notice the favoritism. By high school, I'd accepted my role as the family scapegoat. I worked part time jobs to pay for my own clothes and saved every penny for college. Garrett made it clear I wouldn't receive help with tuition. That money was reserved for Colton's future. Everything changed during my senior year when I needed medical records for a scholarship application. While searching through mom's filing cabinet, I found my birth certificate under father. It listed someone named Pierce Buchanan, not unknown. Like I'd always been told. Pierce Buchanan wasn't some deadbeat who abandoned us. A quick internet search revealed he was a successful architect living two hours away. His company website showed a man with my exact nose and stubborn cowlick. I found his phone number and called, hands shaking first you can and speaking. Hi, I managed. This might sound crazy, but I think you're my father. My name is. Oh, my god, he interrupted. I've been looking for you for 15 years. We met the following weekend at a coffee shop. Pierce explained how mom had vanished while he was deployed overseas with the National Guard. When he returned, she'd moved and changed her phone number. He'd hired investigators, but she'd covered her tracks. Well, I never stopped looking. And showing me a folder filled with investigator reports. I've been paying child support to a state account this whole time, hoping it would reach you somehow. Those unpaid child support checks, mom and Garrett had been collecting them for years. Pierce was nothing like the deadbeat mom had described. He was kind, successful and genuinely interested in my life. He'd saved every penny of child support in a college fund, enough to cover four years at any university I chose. For months, I Kept our relationship secret while planning my revenge. Pierce helped me gather evidence of the diverted child support. We documented every payment, every forged signature, every lie. Father's Day arrived and Garrett expected his usual Celebration. Colton had made him a clay mug.

My daughter's brand new iPhone 14 went missing Tuesday night. She'd saved up for months working double shifts at the ice cream shop. We tore the house apart, searching everywhere. I trusted Mia, my daughter's best friend, completely. She had our house key, knew our Wi-Fi password, called me mom. So when she offered to help search, I didn't suspect anything. The phone vanished Tuesday night. My daughter swore she left it charging on her nightstand before bed. She morning, she tore apart her entire backpack, dumped out every single pocket. Checked inside her pillowcase twice, even looked under her mattress. I found her crying hysterically in the kitchen, late for school, convinced she'd lost everything. She came home devastated, absolutely convinced someone stole it from her gym locker during PE class. I immediately drove to the school, demanded they check all security footage, argued with the principal for over an hour about their lack of security. Friday morning, Verizon customer service told me the phone was completely offline, totally untraceable, like it had vanished into thin air. My daughter sobbed uncontrollably at the breakfast table, begging me not to be mad about all the money she'd wasted saving up for months. I hugged her tight, promised we'd fit, figure it out somehow. Drove straight back to school to check with the principal and security guards one more time. They found absolutely nothing on any of the cameras from that Day. The principal even suggested that kids sometimes sell phones for substance money, which made my stomach churn. With Saturday morning, I was desperately researching phone insurance cost, and replacement options when I got a concerned text from Mia asking if we'd found it yet. She even offered to come over and help search the house one more time, going through every room systematically. I texted back that we were officially giving up the search completely, ordering a replacement Monday morning from the Apple Store downtown. Sunday afternoon, Mia came over for our weekly movie night tradition. She walked in acting completely normal, gave me a warm, motherly hug, asked if we'd heard anything new about the phone from the police or school administrators. She even brought my daughter's favorite candy from the corner store to cheer her up during this difficult time. We all settled comfortably on the leather couch to pick a movie from Netflix together. That's when I suddenly remembered something my tech savvy neighbor had mentioned last week during our conversation. I grabbed my silver laptop from the coffee table and said casually, girls, let me try one last thing before we

I had an eight year old diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Without insulin, she'd be dead in six months. I called the mother in to explain the situation. When I, I told her, she was totally relaxed. Oh, I know about the diabetes. The other doctor mentioned it last week. We're handling it naturally, though. No insulin needed. I thought I misheard her. Your daughter needs insulin to live. Her pancreas doesn't work anymore. She will die without it. The mother smiled. We're doing carrot juice therapy instead, 60 ounces a day. Diabetes is just toxin build up in the pancreas. The juice flushes it out. She said it like she was explaining a recipe. I tried showing her the test results. Her blood sugar is 680. She could slip into a coma any moment. The mother stood up and helped her daughter to her feet. Well, thanks for your opinion, but we're good. The carrot cleanse takes three weeks to work fully. We're only on week two. I blocked the door. You can't leave. She's in diabetic ketoacidosis. She needs emergency treatment. The mother laughed. This is why people don't trust doctors. You create fake emergencies. Move or I'm calling security on you. She pushed past me with her barely conscious daughter. After she left, I immediately called my supervisor and hospital legal. We needed an emergency ethics meeting. A child was going to die within an hour. We had social services, the chief of pediatrics and legal on a conference call. The mother had been flagged at three other hospitals. Each time she left when doctors mentioned insulin. I explained the situation. She's giving her type 1 diabetic daughter only carrot juice. The kids in active ketoacidosis. She'll be dead in weeks, maybe days. Legal said without immediate danger, we couldn't force treatment. The chief suggested we call the mother for a formal care meeting, make it sound routine. When I called, she was surprisingly cheerful. Oh, a second opinion? Sure. I love educating doctors about natural healing. She came back that afternoon with a rolling suitcase. Inside were printed Facebook posts, blog articles and a Powerpoint on her laptop she set up like she was giving a business presentation. Let me show you how Big Pharma created the die diabetes lie. She actually had slides. Slide 1, Insulin is made from GMO bacteria. Slide 2, diabetes didn't exist before 1920. Slide 3, every culture has a vegetable that cures diabetes. Chief of pediatrics interrupted. Ma'am, your daughter's blood sugar was 680. She's dying. The mother clicked to her next slide. That's exactly what they want you to think. Look at this graph I made. Couple days later, the school called 9, 1 1. The daughter had collapsed in the cafeteria, completely unresponsive. When they arrived, I recognized her immediately. The orange tinted skin was unmistakable. Blood sugar was 1,100. She was in a diabetic coma. The Mother rushed in 20 minutes later carrying her suitcase of documents. She fainted because they gave her school lunch instead of her juice. That processed food is poison. The kids started seizing right there on the gurney. Foam.

How did you do it? My ex, Ashley, thought our relationship was charity work. Every time we went somewhere together, she'd find ways to remind me I'd never find someone like her again. It started with her introducing me as just a friend at bars. When guys hit on her, she'd let them buy her drinks, then mention she had a boyfriend after. You should see their faces when I point to you. She'd laugh later. The shock is hilarious. The worst was when she just disappeared one Saturday. No text, nothing. Then I saw her Instagram story. Ashley on some yacht wearing basically a string bikini, sitting on some guy's lap while he popped champagne. Videos of her dancing with a bunch of rich dudes, them doing body shots off her stomach. Best day ever. With location tag, Miami Beach. We live in Jersey. When she came back Sunday night, sunburnt and hungover, I was furious. Where the f were you? She rolled her eyes. Tom invited me to his yacht party last minute. It was a networking opportunity. Tom was some crypto guy who'd been dming her for months. You went to Miami without telling me? She laughed, actually laughed. It was last minute, babe. These chances don't come often. When I showed her the videos of her grinding on those guys, she shrugged. It's a boat thing. Everyone was dancing. Don't be so uptight. You're in a relationship, I yelled. Yeah. And I came back, didn't I? She ruffled my hair like I was a child. I could have stayed in Miami.

I was about to knock on her apartment door to surprise her when I heard voices through her open window. Ashley and her friends, all Instagram model types who made fun of me whenever they visited. Ash still don't get it. Her friend Jenna was saying, why are you with him? You could have literally anyone. I stepped closer to the window, still holding the roses like an idiot. Ashley laughed. You want to know a secret? He'll never leave me, ever. I could do anything and he'd take it. I have complete freedom. I go to Miami. He waits. I hang with my exes. He deals with it. Tom keeps flying me places. Brad takes me to dinner. But this one, she laughed again. He worships me, like actually worships me. But don't you want someone better? Another voice asked. Eventually, yeah. But you know how Brad destroyed my confidence when he cheated with that bartender? This one looks at me like I'm God. He tells me I'm perfect every morning, begs me not to leave him. I need that right now. I heard them all giggling. Once I feel like myself again, I'll find someone on my level. But for now, he's exactly what my ego needs, like therapy but free. They all burst out laughing. I stood there, flowers in hand, and knew something had to change. She needed me for her ego. Time to take away her supply. I spent the next two weeks planning exactly how to.

Raw dogging my enemy's brother. For years, I was infertile. But not just any infertile. I was the false hope infertile. You see, I had had three miscarriages, all in the second trimester. Luckily, everyone was really supportive. Except for my sister in law. That is because the first time I cried in her lap, she stroked my hair and told me she would always be there for me. She told me that when my niece, her baby was born, I would be her godmother. I even started to consider her as one of my closest friends. Fast forward two weeks later to her baby shower. That's where she announced her baby's name. As soon as she said it, bile rose in my throat. It was Faye. The exact same name as my unborn daughter. Well, it's not like you were going to use it, was all she said when I confronted her. All while squealing like a pig being lit on fire. Her words felt like daggers. When my husband came over to ask what was going on, I told him, but instead of getting mad, he just laughed. Well, men can be pretty clueless sometimes. So I waited until we were in the car ride home to re explain the situation. And my husband was the love of my life. But he was also passive due to growing up as the scapegoat of their family. The type to get robbed on the street. And apologize for not having more money to give. That's just how she is, honey, he said with a sigh. So I told myself that at least my unborn daughter's name could live on in someone else's baby. Focused on increasing my fertility by being a healthy Pilates princess. But it never worked. A year and a half later, another baby died in my womb. A few weeks later, I was standing in an aisle of Walgreens when I saw it. My SCL had made a post to commemorate her second son. The caption read, welcome Baby James. Thanks to Emma, my name for the name inspiration, her loss is my gain. This was then followed by the pregnant emoji and the skull emoji. The time she stole my third miscarriages name, Charlotte. I was numb. She would send me nursery photos with captions like bet you wish this could be for your Charlotte. My husband still defended her, saying I was being too sensitive about just names and photography. After four years of I stopped hoping for a child. Sarah was pregnant with her fourth child and made jokes at family dinners about which name she should steal next. Everyone laughed. Everyone except me. That night, something in me snapped. If she wanted another name, I'd give her one she'd never forget. I waited until the next family gathering and broke down in tears. I told Sarah privately that I had discovered something in incredible in my late mother's Diary. A secret middle name she never told anyone. Lexa Teva. I said it meant sacred child in an ancient dialect. I even created fake diary pages and showed her a Pinterest board about honoring deceased grandparents through baby names. Sarah took the name and ran. She announced everywhere that she was naming her daughter Lexie Tiva Rose, to honor our family's hidden history. And this revenge plan was good enough for me. Until eight months later, when the universe threw me a curveball. I was pregnant. Like, third trimester pregnant. I almost cried with joy. No more memorials. No more wondering whether there was something deeply wrong with me. Me and my husband have been waiting to announce it, not wanting to get our hopes up. And that same week, we got the text. Sarah inviting us to her baby shower. I wore a flowy dress that hid everything. My husband supported my decision, not giving an F anymore. Sarah had gone all out for the shower, bigger than any before. The whole family was there, plus her mommy blog followers who'd been following baby Lexie's journey for months. Sarah was in the middle of giving her speech about. About discovering this sacred family name, when I actually. Sarah, I have something to share, too, I said, smoothing my dress over my now obvious bump. The room went dead silent. Sarah's mouth hung open. Mid sentence, my mother in law dropped her champagne glass. 29 weeks today. I announced Cradling my belly. We wanted to be sure this time. The erupted in screams and congratulations. Sarah's face drained of color. That's when my husband, the saint of the family, stood up and raised his hand. Sarah, you were saying something about lexativa, about all that research you did. Sarah's face had gone from white to red. Yes, it's. It means sacred child. An ancient. That's so weird. He interrupted, pulling out his phone, because when I Google Lex

Always pulled our money together into joint accounts. Last month, Lisa comes home from her girls night all excited. Babe Sarah and Jen both have separate finances with their husbands. We're both doing so well financially. What if we each just handle our own expenses? More independence, you know, more modern. Honestly, it sounded reasonable. We're both adults making decent money. Why not? Sure, let's split everything, 50, 50, rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, everything. She seemed a bit surprised by how specific I was getting. Well, I meant more like we each pay for our own stuff. You handle the bills you want, I handle mine. More flexible, red flag, but I agreed anyway. Maybe she had a point about flexibility. So the next day I sat down with our budget and divided everything perfectly down the middle. Rent one, $400 each. Utilities, $150 each. Internet, $50 each. Groceries, $400 each. Insurance, $200 each. Car payments, gas, personal expenses, all separate. I made a nice little spreadsheet and showed her. She said, wow, okay, very thorough, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Here's what I didn't expect. Lisa is absolutely terrible with money, always has been. I just never noticed because I've been handling all our finances for Five years she never had to budget or track expenses. We 2.

The one will arrive 10 minutes late into the class, start complaining about the weather, traffic, the principal or even her husband then delay the lesson with a 20 minute existential conversation, let you eat, drink and chew gum and you might even watch a movie at the end of the hour while the other will stand as a North Korean solidator in the middle of the room and begin threatening students with pop quizzes and detention.

Because of their regret, I legally changed my name to Atlas when I turned 18. My birth certificate had Michael William Reynolds, Jr. On it, named after my father, who walked out when I was two. For 16 years, I hated being called junior or Little Mike. Every time someone said my name, it felt like dragging around the shadow of a man who decided we weren't worth keeping. School always started the same. Michael Reynolds, the teacher would call. I go by MJ. I'd answer, trying to create distance. Mom worked two jobs after he left. She'd help with homework despite being exhausted, and never complained. Not even when grandparents would say, he looks more like his father every day. As if that was a compliment. When I was 15, mom started dating David. He was nothing like my father. Quiet, reliable, with a dry sense of humor. An English professor who wore sweater vests and collected maps. His first visit, he brought me a journal instead of forcing some guy bonding activity. David never tried to replace my dad. He just showed up. He came to baseball games with his grading work, occasionally looking up to cheer. He helped with college applications and never made me feel like a burden. Once I heard him tell mom, he's not my son, but I couldn't be prouder if he was. Before senior year, I researched name changes. Nothing felt right. Until I Remembered a book David gave me about Greek mythology. Atlas, the Titan who held up the heavens. That resonated when I told them my plan. Mom was supportive, but confused. Why Atlas? She. He asked. Because Atlas carried the world on his shoulders. That's how I felt, carrying Dad's name when he couldn't carry his responsibilities. At least Atlas never put down his burden and walked away. David nodded. Names have power. They tell a story. Exactly. I want to tell my own. After my birthday, I filed the paperwork. Six weeks later, I became Atlas Reynolds. My first college letter, addressed to my new name, is still pinned to my board. Everything was fine until last week, when my biological father called. Mom handed me the phone with a strange look. Junior. How's my little Michael? Junior? My stomach dropped. That person doesn't exist anymore. What? My name is Atlas now. He laughed like it was a joke. That's not your name. You're Michael William Reynolds, junior. Named you myself right before you left. Added, I legally changed it. He said he was changed. Sorry. Wanted to reconnect. He'd moved back to town with his new family, but wanted to make things right with his first son. He kept repeating my old name, like he could force it back onto me. Yesterday, I found his car in our driveway. Mom and David sat stiffly in the living room with my biological father on our couch. Like he belonged there. They ambushed me with dinner. Mom kept giving apologetic glances. David was quiet. My father dominated with stories about his new life, kids and business. At dessert, he addressed the elephant in the room. So you've changed your name to Atlas. Like the MacBook? Like the Titan, I corrected. Well, he chuckled. Time to read.

Our chemistry teacher, Mr. Rodriguez, had this insane rule. If your phone made any sound during class, he'd lock it in his desk for a full week. Not the day, the entire week. Senior year, everyone knew someone who'd lost their phone to him. He kept them like trophies in his desk drawer, grinning whenever kids begged to get them back. There was this quiet kid, Marcus, who worked nights at McDonald's to help his mom pay bills. Twelve year old sister Lily walked home from Jefferson Middle every day through this sketchy area near the auto shops on Fifth Street. She was supposed to text Marcus the second she got home. One Tuesday, during our midterm, Marcus's phone buzzed just once. Text. Rodriguez didn't even look up from his crossword puzzle. Just held out his fat hand. Phone. See you next Tuesday, Mr. Johnson. Marcus went pale. Please, Mr. Rodriguez, my sister should have put it on silent. Your poor planning isn't my emergency. Marcus actually got on his knees, begged. Explained about his mom's double shifts at the hospital, about Lily being alone, about the creeps who hung around that neighborhood. Rodriguez just smiled and slid the phone into his desk. Maybe you'll think twice next time. That afternoon changed everything. Lily never made it home. Some freak in a white van had been watching Jefferson middle for weeks. When she tried calling Marcus first, like she always did. When Scared his phone. Phone just rang in Rodriguez's locked drawer. She was missing for four hours. Four hours of Marcus pacing the McDonald's parking lot, checking the time, knowing something was wrong, but having no way to know what. Police found her behind the Valvoline on Eighth Street. Physically okay, but she wouldn't stop shaking. Wouldn't talk for three days. Marcus came to school the next morning looking like he'd aged 10 years. He walked straight to Rodriguez's room during lunch. I need my phone back.

My roommate Lisa was doing her nightly skincare routine when we heard glass breaking downstairs. She just applied a thick green face mask and was wearing her ratty bathrobe with hair and rollers. Did you hear that? I whispered. Lisa grabbed her phone to call 9 1 1, but then got this evil grin. Wait, I have a better idea. She crept to the top of the stairs and let out the most blood curdling scream I've ever heard, then started speaking in tongues. Literally just gibberish that sounded vaguely Latin. Spiritus malum, enter this vessel. I heard the burglar drop something and curse. Lisa crawled down the stairs backwards like the girl from the Exorcist, still screaming in her made up demon language. The green face mask was cracking, making her look legitimately terrifying. The burglar was backing toward the window when our other roommate, Ben, emerged from his room. He immediately caught on. The possession is spreading! He yelled. Everyone get the salt! Ben started throwing table salt everywhere while chanting the Pokemon theme song in a deep, ominous voice. The burglar was now pressed against the wall. RTB forgotten on the floor. Please, he begged. Leave. I'm sorry. Lisa's head snapped toward him. She put in her glow in the dark Halloween contacts. In the dim light, her eyes were literally glowing green. You disturbed the ritual, she growled. That's when our fourth roommate, Kevin, joined in. He emerged Playing his violin badly, just screeching notes while swaying like he was in a trance. The demons need music! Ben shouted, now drawing symbols on the wall with ketchup. Say louder! The burglar tried to run, but Lisa's spider walked toward him at surprising speed. He actually screamed. I need an old priest and a young priest, I yelled, getting into it. I'm Protestant! The burglar cried. I don't know any priests! Lisa stood up suddenly, did a perfect backbend and whispered, then you're screwed! The man literally wet himself. I saw the stain spreading on his jeans. Kevin's violence screeching intensified. Ben was now speaking in Klingon. Lisa started doing that creepy clicking sound from the grudge. The burglar fell to his knees. What do you want from me? Your soul, Lisa hissed. Or your confession? I'll confess. I've robbed 12 houses. I'll tell you everything! He started listing addresses, eightes where he'd sold stuff. Ben was frantically taking notes while still pretending to be possessed. When the cops arrived, they found a burglar in tears, begging for an exorcist. Lisa, still in full green face mask and glowing contacts. Catch up! Demon symbols on our walls. Kevin playing my heart will go on badly on violin. Ben reading the burglar his rights and clanging on. The burglar immediately confessed to everything. Begged the cops to take him to a church instead of jail. Kept asking if we were really human. The officer looked at Lisa. Ma'am, what exactly Happened here. Skincare night, she said sweetly. Very important for your pores. They took the burglar away. He was muttering about the green demon and violin of the damned. Cops came back later for our statements. One of them finally cracked. In 20 years on the force, I've never had a purse bag for holy water in the squad car. Turns out the burglar had been hitting houses in our area for months. His full confession cleared over a dozen cases. The detective said whatever you did probably saved him from years more crime. He found religion real quick. Already signed up for seminary school. Lisa's review of her faith.

Okay, I mean, you should have grabbed his phone and said, uh, you have three missed calls from Holly, you know, wanna explain who she is? Well, I actually did do that. Okay. And what did he say? He says that she's a marketing person for an account that they're trying to get at work. Okay. And do you believe him? First I did, but then I started thinking about like, she calls at really weird times. So for example, she'll call on the weekend or at night. And yeah, what marketing person does that? Yeah, here's another thing I was gonna see if she represents a client that your husband is trying to get, I would feel like he would be the one doing all the calling, not the other way around. Have you seen any text conversations between the two of them? No, but he locked his phone. Yeah, but I mean, you're married. You don't have your husband's password? No, actually I don't. Alright. Does he have any Facebook friends named Holly? Like maybe a new Facebook friend just recently? Uh, I'm not sure. I didn't check. Okay, so what you want us to do is find out if he's telling the truth and find out who this Holly girl is. Is she really a potential client or is there something else going on? Yeah, that's what I wanna know. Okay. Yeah. Now I don't suppose you have her number. No. Um, but when it calls, it doesn't like show her number or anything. It just says, you know, Holly's calling or missed call. Right? Okay. So we can't call her. We can definitely call him though, right? Yeah, totally. Okay, so let's devise a quick plan here during the commercial break and then when we come back, let's see what we can find out about this. Okay. Okay. So we're gonna call Tony, call Tony and, and actually tell him that you are this Holly girl's sister. Oh no, not sister. It's like say cousin say I'm Holly's cousin and we're throwing her a birthday party. So we stole her phone and we called all of our contacts. Okay, so we could invite people, but we don't want her to know about it. Oh, like surprise, like a surprise. Okay. But yeah, we saw that you were in her phone. Okay. And then when he says, yeah, I'm in her phone say Like, well, we just assumed you were her new man because of all the time she's calling you. Yeah. Okay. Stinky. And then, yeah, and then we'll see. Uh.

In our family, when a husband dies, the widow has exactly 40 days to follow him into the afterlife. They called it the Eternal Service. Packed because apparently men needed servants even after death. I was seven when I watched my Aunt Ling drink the ceremonial poison at Uncle Ling's 40th Day memorial. Her hands shook as she raised the cup, but her mother in law held her wrist steady, making sure every drop went down. Aunt May was 23. She tried to run on day 38. Made it all the way to the bus station before Uncle Ling's brothers dragged her back. I remember her begging, saying she was pregnant. They said the baby could serve Uncle Ling too. My mom would brush my hair every night and tell me how romantic it was that wives love their husbands so much they couldn't live without them. But I saw the way her hands trembled. Whenever dad got a cold, I saw her counting his grey hairs. Like she was calculating how many years she had left. Sometimes I catch her staring at the kitchen knives. Not an escape every way, but like she was measuring which one would be sharpest in 20 years. The thing about this tradition was it wasn't even that old. My great grandfather started it after his brother's widow remarried someone younger and prettier. He said it was about loyalty, but everyone Knew it was about control. Dead women can't inherit property. Dead women can't remarry. Dead women can't testify about what their husband did to them. Dead women can't tell anyone about the bruises hidden under their funeral clothes. The ceremonies were always the same day. 40 would arrive and the whole family would gather. The widow would wear white, her husband's favorite dress. She'd serve tea to his relatives one last time. Then they'd bring out the cup. Always porcelain, always with painted flowers. The poison smelled like almonds. They'd make her drink it in front of everyone, then lay her next to her husband's photo until she stopped breathing. Usually it took about 20 minutes. The younger kids were supposed to watch to learn about duty. When I was 15, Dad had a heart attack. That he survived, but it changed everything. Mom started acting differently. She'd wake me up at 3:00am for lessons. First, she taught me how to forge signatures, making me practice Dad's name until I could do it perfectly. Then came the banking stuff. How to transfer money without triggering alerts. How to hide assets in different names. She showed me websites for fake IDS. Taught me which states were easiest to disappear in. Made me memorize bus routes to the Mexican border. Just in case you ever need to disappear, she'd say. But we both knew who really needed to disappear. Then she showed me the videos. She'd been collecting them for years. Any Footage of widow ceremonies from old family gatherings. She had them hidden on an encrypted hard drive labelled recipe collection. She'd pause at certain moments. Look at Aunt Ling's cup. See how it's different from Aunt May's, she'd say. Look at Aunt Lou's funeral. Notice how the coffin is so light when they carry it. Look at how her sister keeps checking her phone during the burial. That's when I Learned about the secret network. For 20 years, widows have been faking their deaths. Some use special drugs that slowed their heartbeat to nothing for 48 hours. One aunt was a nurse who'd been stealing them from the hospital for years. Others had doctor friends who falsified death certificates for cash. There was a whole underground railroad of safe houses in other states where dead women started new lives. They had new name, new social security numbers, new everything. Mom taught me the code words at family gatherings. Such a peaceful passing meant the widow escaped successfully. She fought till the end. Meant someone was suspicious. Beautiful ceremony meant they needed help with documents. The flowers were perfect. Meant they needed money. She's with him now. Meant she didn't make it out. I started helping when I was 17. Creating fake

Um, do I know you? Why are you texting me? Sorry if this is weird, but I've always thought you looked interesting. So I took the courage to say hi today. Cool, cool. But who the fuck are you? We never spoke before. I was hoping this is our first time. You sure have a slow brain. Why aren't you answering my question? What question? Who is this? Someone from your dreams? That's cute. So who am I actually talking to? I feel like if I told you, it wouldn't be as fun. Plus I will get rejected. So what? Now? I want to play a game with you. A game? I'm down. We keep talking until July. If you know who I am, you decide if we go on a date or not. And if I don't know who you are, then I will not reveal myself. Sure, why not? Just so you know, my eyes are on another girl. She's my crush since 1st grade. Oh, okay. Hiya. I saw you on the bus today. Oh, yeah, you gave that old lady your seat. Wait, you saw that? Who are you exactly? Someone who sees more than you think. Kind of creepy, but go on. Not creepy, just observant. Alright, if we're playing this game, describe yourself physically. Hmm. Should I make it easy for you? Just a little hint? Something I'd recognize, you know, that's fair. Well, I'm very small. I'm blonde and I always wear a pair of red sneakers. I've worn them every day since the start of the semester. Half the school wears red sneakers. Maybe I'll need more than that to be sure. Fair enough. Tell me about the girl you have a crush on. Why do you wanna know? No reason. I'm just curious. I feel like you don't like her already. You will probably do something to her, I promise you. I'm just curious about it. I probably don't know her. Okay. Her name is Ellie. She's a white girl, dresses really well and her smile is just out of this world. She's just gorgeous. Oh, I see who that might be. Wait, do you know her? Maybe, maybe not. Anyways, I'm going with my mom. Talk to you later. Talk soon. Unknown. Haha. Hiya. Have you spotted any interesting shoes lately? Not yet. I've been distracted. Ellie was at the same party as me last night. Oh, and how did it go? It was alright. She didn't notice me much. She was with her friend all the time. Maybe it's for the best. It'll give you more time to focus on other mysteries. Me.

Sounds insane, but let me explain. That world wasn't just a game. It was my escape. Two years of building castles, farms, entire cities, all gone in one second. One afternoon I logged on and everything was wiped. I ran to her room, asked why, and she just laughed in my face. Relax. It's just blocks. My parents even sided with her, telling me I should spend less time gaming. But me, I wasn't laughing. That was the exact second I decided she had to pay. I didn't rage. I didn't fight. For weeks, I pretended to move on. I even let her use my tablet, even shared snacks with her. But behind that fake smile, I was studying her. I knew every routine. When she showered, when she left for school, when she went swimming alone in the backyard pool. That summer day, the sun was hot and she went outside with her floaties. I followed silently. She thought I was just hanging out, scrolling on my phone. But when she jumped into the pool, I was right behind her. She giggled, splashed me and dove underwater. That's when I pushed her down. She fought, she kicked, bubbles rising everywhere. But I held firm. The twist, when it was over, I leaned down and whispered, respawn. In the real world, sis, everyone thought it was a tragic accident. My parents cried for weeks, but I knew the truth. She deleted My world, so I deleted hers.

I thought everyone heard the vacuum cleaner screaming when it turned on. For years, my parents told me I was being dramatic when I covered my ears during everyday stuff. Turns out I wasn't dramatic at all. When I was little, probably like 3 or 4, I'd always ask my mom why the TV was so loud, check the volume and it would be on like 15, which is pretty normal. But to me it sounded like someone was yelling in my ear. My parents thought I was just being a weird kid. As I got older, things got worse. I started wearing these chunky noise cancelling headphones to school assemblies because the microphone feedback made me wanna throw up. During fire drills, I would literally hide under my desk crying because the alarm felt like someone was stabbing my eardrums with a fork. The school nurse started calling my parents saying I was having panic attacks during normal school activities. My mom took me to our family doctor when I was 8. He did the basic hearing test where you raise your hand when you hear the beep. My hearing was perfect, so he said I probably had anxiety. That's when the real nightmare started. Every little sound became torture. The microwave beeping sounded like a fire truck Siren. When my dad would start his car in the garage, I could feel the Engine vibrations in my chest and it made me dizzy and sick. Stopped eating dinner with my family because the sound of forks scraping plates made me want to scream. My parents were getting frustrated with me. My mom would say stuff like normal people don't get panic attacks from the dishwasher running. My dad thought I was making it up for attention. They sent me to a counselor who gave me breathing exercises and told me to download meditation apps. By the time I turned 14, I couldn't function anymore. I stopped riding in cars because the engine noise made me nauseous. Showers hurt my ears so bad I could only take them for like two minutes. I couldn't go to restaurants because the sound of people talking mixed with plates clinking sounded like metal scraping against metal. One day during sophomore year, we had a fire drill and I completely lost it. I collapsed in the hallway sobbing and shaking. The sound was so overwhelming I thought my head was going to explode. Three teachers had to carry me to the nurse's office. Most of my teachers thought I was being overdramatic, but my substitute science teacher, Mrs. Lopez.

My fiance Anthony has this whole thing about his morning coffee. Not like a normal person who just drinks whatever is there. No, this guy needs his coffee made in a very specific way or his entire day is apparently ruined. French press only. Water heated to exactly 200 degrees. Four minutes of steam in time, no more, no less. And the coffee has to be this expensive organic stuff from some fancy roaster downtown that cost, like 30 bucks a bag. I've been living with this routine for two years now. Every single morning, I wake up 20 minutes before him just to start this whole coffee ceremony. Set the timer, heat the water, measure everything out perfectly, because god forbid Anthony has to make his own coffee like a functioning adult. But yesterday morning, I was running late for work, my alarm didn't go off, and I had exactly 15 minutes to get ready and leave. So I did what any normal person would do. I made regular coffee in our regular coffee maker. Use the good beans, but just press a button instead of doing the whole French press thing. Anthony came downstairs and immediately knew something was different. He took one sip, and his face went all twisted up like I just served him poison. This isn't how I like my coffee, he said, holding the mug like it personally offended him. I explained that I was Running late and didn't have time for the whole production. That's when he lost it. Started yelling about how I don't respect his preferences and how hard is it to just make coffee the right way. I'm standing there in my work clothes, keys in hand, and this grown man is having a meltdown over coffee. You know how important this is to me? He kept saying, it's the one thing I asked for. I finally snapped, Anthony, it's coffee. It's literally just coffee. And also, it's not the one thing you ask for. You ask for a lot of things. He got all quiet and weird.

When mom married Eric, I was 8 years old and desperate for a father figure. My biological dad had walked out when I was 3, leaving behind only a box of photos and unpaid child support. Garrett seemed perfect at first. He fixed our broken faucet, taught me to ride a bike and never missed my school place. But everything changed when my half brother Colton was born. Suddenly, I became the unwanted stepchild. Garrett would buy Colton expensive toys while telling me my allowance was earned, not given. At family dinners, he'd brag about Colton's first steps while dismissing my honorable achievements. When relatives visited, he'd introduce Colton as my son and me as my wife's daughter. The worst part was how he'd punish me for things Colton did. When Colton broke the living room lamp, I was grounded for not watching him properly when he drew on the walls, I lost my art supplies for setting a bad example. Mom never intervened. She was so grateful to have a husband again that she pretended not to notice the favoritism. By high school, I'd accepted my role as the family scapegoat. I worked part time jobs to pay for my own clothes and saved every penny for college. Garrett made it clear I wouldn't receive help with tuition. That money was reserved for Colton's Future. Everything changed during my senior year when I needed medical records for a scholarship application. While searching through mom's filing cabinet, I found my birth certificate under father. It listed someone named Pierce Buchanan, not unknown, like I'd always been told. Pierce Buchanan wasn't some deadbeat who abandoned us. A quick internet search revealed he was a successful architect living two hours away. His company website showed a man with my exact nose and stubborn cowlick. I found his phone number and called, hands shaking. Pierce Buchanan speaking. Hi. I managed. This might sound crazy, but I think you're my father. My name is. Oh, my god, he interrupted. I've been looking for you for 15 years. We met the following weekend at a coffee shop. Pierce explained how mom had vanished while he was deployed overseas with the National Guard. When he returned, she'd moved and changed her phone number. He'd hired investigators, but she'd covered her tracks. Well, I never stopped looking, he said, showing me a folder filled with investigator reports. I've been paying child support to a state account this whole time, hoping it would reach you somehow. Those unpaid child support checks, mom and Garrett had been collecting them for years. Pierce was nothing like the deadbeat mom had described. He was kind, successful and genuinely interested in my life. He'd saved every penny of child support in a college fund, enough to cover four years at any university I chose. For months, I Kept our relationship secret while planning my revenge. Here's helped me gather evidence of the diverted child support. We documented every payment, every forged signature, every lie.

Oh, okay, now hold on a second. Was it last night? Valentine's night? Yes. And he wasn't with you? No. Okay, see, here's what happened, okay? So I asked him last week if he wanted to go out to dinner for Valentine's Day, and he said no. He has to work, right? He's a server. Um, he's. He works over at the pot. So it makes total sense for him to work on Valentine's night, cause, you know, it's huge tip money, right? It's one of the biggest days of the year. Right? Yeah, I was gonna say, I think at that place, it's probably the biggest tipping day of the year. Yeah. So, like I said, I was totally okay with it. No problem. So. But listen to this. I decided I wanted to surprise him. So since we couldn't be together on Valentine's night and we couldn't hang out, I thought I would get him a little gift and then surprise him at work with some flowers. And I got a balloon, you know, just to kind of embarrass him in front of his co workers. You know, I wasn't gonna stay all night. I just thought I would go and surprise him and then take off. Okay, sounds. Sounds like a good plan. So what happened? So I get there, right? And I asked the girl at the front if she can find Brian, and she's Like, yeah, no problem. So she disappears for a while, and she's gone like kind of a long time. And then she comes back and says, well, Brian's not working tonight. He called off. So I'm like, um, no, he's definitely working. Can you please check again? So this girl goes to double check and she's like, no, my manager said he called off this afternoon. So I'm like, hmm. Huh. Alright. So I call him, right? He doesn't answer. So then I text him and I text him, I'm like, hey, are you okay? And he writes right back and he's like, I'm fine, what's up? So then I go, well, I just stopped by your work and they said that you called off. And he text me back, yeah, I wasn't feeling well, so I stayed home. I'm like, alright, so, well, never fear, I'm on my way over. I got something to make you feel better, right? I got the flowers, I got the balloon. It's Valentine's Day. And he text me right back. He goes, no, babe, please don't. I'm not feeling very well. I don't want you to get whatever I've got. Well, that has been going around. Everybody's been getting sick here lately. I mean, we've all had something. And as many of you women want to come over and take care of us when we're sick, it's always a good idea to ask first. Cause like, what if. What if, what if he's got The poops or something, you know, you don't want your girlfriend over to witness that. Well, yeah, but unfortunately for him, I went to his apartment anyway, right, cause I was just gonna leave the flowers and stuff outside his door and text them like, I left you a surprise outside. Feel better. I love you, you know? So I get to his apartment, but his car wasn't there, so he's completely lying. So wait, you went to his apartment anyway? Yeah, like, his work is like two minutes from his house, so I was just gonna leave the stuff for him, but I noticed his car was gone. And the reason I noticed is that he's got assigned parking, so I know exactly where his car goes and it wasn't there. So you think he's lying then? I'm not sure, but I'd like to know where he was. Well, I mean, I actually could have been at patient first. Cause I can tell you from experience, unless you're bleeding on the floor and your face is falling off, it's gonna take him forever to get a room. Yeah, that's true. Well, yeah, I thought about that. Right, but if you're actually there, why not just say, hey, I'm a patient first, you know, don't bother coming by my apartment. Alright, yeah, I. Yeah, that's. That's also true. Let me ask you this. Do you have any reason to suspect him cheating? Like, is there somebody else that you suspect No, not really. I mean, but if he was cheating, it totally wouldn't surprise me. Okay, and I guess that's what you want us to find out for you. I really want to know where he was last night when he was supposed to be with his girlfriend. Of Valentine's Day? Well, yeah. Okay. Alright. Um, but what do you guys think? Any ideas on this one? I mean. I mean, there's nobody else to call. Cause we don't even know for sure if there is somebody else. so maybe we could call and say we're from patients first or something. Well, we don't even know that he went there to begin with. Or we could do our fun game. The Naked Game. Yeah, we call him and ask him who's the last person to see him naked? And, uh, see what he says. We've done that before. Yeah, we could. It's just it's so close to Valentine's Day. Like, it might sound like a setup. Like Lydia is. This is gonna sound crazy, but do you have to know what bank Brian uses? Like, does he have a debit card? Um, yeah, he does. I'm pretty sure it's bank of America. Okay, when you guys go do go out to eat and stuff, does he pay in cash or does he usually use his debit card? Oh god, no, he never has cash on him. Okay, like we went out last weekend and I had to pay for parking because He didn't have any cash, so. Okay. And you said bank of America? Yeah, I'm like 90% positive. Okay, perfect. I think I know how we can find out where he was last night. Stand by. Cause we're gonna need his phone number. Okay. Okay. Okay. So there's a fifty fifty chance of this working. When we come back, either he's gonna look really stupid or we are.

Mom's eating breakfast scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading Life 3, 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work hard time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest, she says. If we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear, which sounds like something a dictator would say. But whatever. She makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realize immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3, 60 doesn't just show where you are, it shows your speed when driving, your phone battery and sends notification for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect. Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says, no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is, men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realize she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom, check your location. While I'm at school, dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realize she's literally sitting there refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day three, mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 in a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit, which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses a client worth $2,000. Week 2, she sees I stopped at McDonald's for 3 minutes and lectures me about wasting money, which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for 4 hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and asks her 4 hours at one store? And mom stares at me like I should have warned her he was checking, but how can I when she's watching my every move? She used To text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until eleven PM Dad mentions that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough but I've been to that clinic. They close at 6 that night. Dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives marked final notice and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that and mom says processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location pins on the Week 5 and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the Medical Plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11:00am and it's now six PM I tell my manager I'm sick. Drive over, Dad's already there in the parking lot looking at life. 3, 60 zoomed in. Her car is not here, I say and dad points across the street where the pin actually is. We both see it at the same same time. Royal Flush Casino. Dad's face goes white. No way. We walk in together. She's at the penny slots with a bucket of coins, empty drink cups stacked everywhere. She's been here all day. She's talking to Another woman. My family thinks I'm at the doctor. It gives me all day here. She puts a 20 in the machine. This is from my daughter's paycheck. She'll never know. I step forward. I know now. Mom spends around seeing us both and dad holds up life. Three, 60, doctor appointment. She starts stammering, but her casino friend makes it worse. Just tell them about your system. You're due for a big win after last month's losses. Dad's voice cracks. Last month, how much? Now Mom's crying, saying 8,000, maybe more. I realized why she's been watching our location so obsessively. She needed to know we weren't coming home while she gambled away our money. I feel sick realizing this is where she went. All those times I told dad she was at appointments. I helped her lie so she could sit here feeding our rent money into slot machines. Mom admits she's been going every day for three.

I was marinating ribs at 6:00am when Lexi texted me, you're uninvited. We don't want you there. No explanation, just a cold dismissal from the person who never lifted a finger for these reunions. For eight years, I've been the backbone of every family gathering. I brought the smoker, bought all the alcohol, coordinated everything. Lexie just showed up and took credit while I did the actual work. She'd waltz in wearing some designer dress, pose for photos and act like she organized everything. While I was sweating over a hot grill, I stared at that text, hands covered in marinade, and typed back, fine, I'm taking my barbecue and drinks with me. An hour later, my phone exploded, 15 missed calls from cousins, uncles, everyone panicking. Wait, you're not coming? What about the food? Lexi said you bailed on us. My voicemail was completely full. Text after text rolled in. Please tell me you're joking. The reunion won't be the same without your brisket. What happened? That's when I realized Lexi's fatal mistake. She never told them she uninvited me. She just announced I canceled, left them scrambling with no backup plan. Classic Lexi, creating problems and expecting everyone else to solve them. I texted my cousin Matthew, Lexi uninvited me, but you're welcome at my place. I've got everything we need. Matthew immediately called back. Absolutely Furious. She did what? That's completely insane. I'm coming over and bringing everyone I can convince. Within minutes, half the family was choosing my backyard over Lexi's disaster. Even the neighbours wanted in. When word spread about the impromptu cookout happening on my street, my phone kept buzzing with acceptances. Uncle Hank on my way with the cornhole boards and my famous hot sauce. Cousin Liz bringing my potato salad and the good folding chairs. Even my elderly Aunt Diana said she'd rather come to mine because that girl has no business running anything important. By 10:00am, I had people showing up to help set up. My neighbour Jeff brought his outdoor speakers and string lights. The kids from down the street asked if they could use my pool. This was turning into something way bigger than any family reunion we'd ever had. Lexi started calling around noon, completely panic. Where is everyone? Only six people showed up and I ordered food for 30. I could hear the desperation and anger in her voice. She tried to exclude me but ended up excl including herself from the real party. By one PM, I had 43 people at my house, the biggest party I'd ever thrown. The ribs were falling off the bone. The beer was ice cold and everyone kept thanking me for saving their weekend. Kids were splashing in the pool. Adults were playing cards and the whole neighborhood smelled like heaven. Meanwhile, Aunt Diana called me laughing, Lexi's Reunion is a complete disaster. She ordered pizza for 30 people and only has six there, including herself. She's blaming everyone but herself and having a complete meltdown in front of what's left of the family. The best part, three more family showed up uninvited because they heard through the neighborhood Grapevine about the legendary barbecue happening on Maple Street. Even people who weren't family wanted to join the.

My brother Tyler always had this habit of taking my stuff without asking, but I never thought he'd go this far. Last month I saved up for three months straight working at target to buy a ticket to see blink 1 82. This wasn't just any show either. They barely tour anymore and tickets were selling for like 200 bucks minimum. I finally got one during the pre sale and felt like I'd won the lottery. I kept the ticket in my desk drawer in this little plastic sleeve, checking on it every few days like some kind of weirdo. Tyler knew how excited I was about it. I've been talking about this concert since they announced the tour. Hell, I even asked him if he wanted to come with me and offered to help him get a ticket, but he said he wasn't interested in old people music. Fast forward to last Tuesday. I come home from my shift and go to check on my ticket before dinner. The plastic sleeve is there, but it's empty. My heart literally dropped into my stomach. I tore my entire room apart thinking maybe it fell out somewhere. Nothing. I marched straight to Tyler's room and found him playing call of duty with his headset on. I yanked it right off his head and asked where my ticket was. He didn't even pause his Game just shrugged and said he sold it to some kid at school for 180 bucks because he needed money for new cleats. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. He sold my ticket that I bought with my money for his stupid soccer cleats. When I asked how he even got into my room, he said I left my door unlocked and he figured I wouldn't mind since I'm always sharing stuff with him anyway. Which is complete bull because sharing a bag of chips is not the same as selling someone's concert ticket. I started yelling at him to get it back, but he said the kid already gave him the money and there was nothing he could do. He had the nerve to tell me to calm down and that I was being dramatic over just a concert. That's when I noticed his gaming setup. His PlayStation 5, the fancy racing wheel he got for his birthday, his gaming chair, two controllers, and his huge monitor. All of it probably worth around 800 bucks total. I told him he had 24 hours to get my ticket back or I was selling his stuff. He laughed at me and said I wouldn't dare because mom and dad would kill me. Then he put his headset back on and ignored me like I wasn't even there. The next day after school I checked with him one more time. Still no ticket, so I waited until he went to soccer. Practice. And our parents went grocery shopping. I loaded everything into our dad's truck. The PlayStation monitor, all of it. I drove straight to this gaming store downtown that buys used stuff. The guy behind the counter looked at everything and offered me 650 cash on the spot. I told him I needed at least 700 because I had to replace something important. He agreed when he saw the receipt showing Tyler paid 12 for the PS five alone last year. I took that money and drove to the kid's house that Tyler sold my ticket to. Turns out he was actually pretty cool about it. His mom made him give me the ticket back when I explained what happened. And she only made me pay her the one 80 her son originally paid. She said her kid could wait for the next tour. So I got my ticket back and still had 5 and 20 left over, which I put in my savings account when Tyler got home from

She announced my stepdad bought me a car. My real dad never did anything. I smiled and left. My daughter Rebecca just graduated valedictorian. I paid 340 dollar monthly child support for 11 years. Plus her phone, insurance, dance lessons, everything. Most importantly, I've been secretly building her a 91,000 dollar college fund since she was born. The divorce happened when Rebecca was 7. Her mom Patricia remarried Trent four years ago. This guy who sells insurance but acts like he's running Goldman Sachs. Always posting about his investments on social media. Driving a leased BMW, living in the expensive part of town. Classic fake it till you make it type. But here's what really got to me. Trent had been slowly poisoning Rebecca against me. Little comments like your real dad should be doing more or if I were your father, I'd handle this differently. I heard it through Rebecca's casual mentions, but I figured she was smart enough to see through it. I was wrong. At her party, Rebecca grabs the microphone. My stepdad Trent actually invests in my future, she announces to 50 people my real dad never did anything like this. Trent's grinning like he just won the lottery. My ex wife won't look at me. Everyone staring. My own brother Zach looked like he wanted to punch someone. The neighbours were staring at their shoes. But Rebecca wasn't done. She kept going. I finally know what it feels like to have Someone who cares enough to make grand gestures. Someone who actually wants to invest in my future. Each word was a knife. This was my kid. The one I driven to every soccer practice, ate up with during every fever. Taught to drive in empty parking lots on weekends. I could have listed everything I'd done. I could have mentioned the college fund right there. Instead, I hugged Rebecca, said congratulations, and walked out. That night I sat in my kitchen thinking about what she said. About Trent investing in her future. About him being someone who actually cares. Fine. If Trent wanted to be the real father, he could handle the real responsibilities. I transferred the entire 91 thousand dollar college fund into my personal account. Called my insurance, removed Rebecca effective immediately. Called the phone company, removed Rebecca from my family plan, cancelled her dance lessons that I've been paying for since she was five. Then I did some digging on her new car because something felt off about Trent's grand gesture. Here's where it gets interesting. Plot twist Trent didn't buy Rebecca a car. He co signed a loan with Rebecca as the primary borrower. Monthly payment $340. Exactly what I've been paying in child support. Rebecca's income zero. But it gets worse. The bank had used my financial information as back king without telling me. They'd called my work, verified my employment, checked my credit. Trent had listed me as a financial reference and family support System for the loan. When the bank called for their routine verification follow up, I told them the truth. I'm no longer providing financial support for Rebecca. Her stepdad.

So I treated her exactly like I treat my other friends. With boundaries. Tara and I had been together for two years, living together for one. We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer, where I was supposed to be her plus one. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends. We get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends. But not amazing partners. Here's what killed me. She said all this while already having packed a bag. Bag? Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour.

Like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me, but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. I treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7:00am. Could you drop off my work laptop? Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office. Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. Got plans. Monday works better. She didn't like that. But what was she going to say? We're just friends now. Week two, Tara started cracking. She showed up at the apartment while I was at work. Still using her key. Helped herself to groceries, did laundry, took a shower. I texted her, I'll need the key back. My friends don't have keys to my place. This is ridiculous. We live together. We used to live together. Now we're friends. Different relationship, different boundaries. She came by that evening, furious. You changed the locks. You no longer live here. Here's a box of your stuff. I'm treating you exactly like I treat my friends. None of them have keys to my place. But I'm not just any friend. According to you, that's exactly what you are. The real kicker came at game night with our friend group. I showed up solo. She showed up with some dude named Connor from yoga, clearly trying to make me jealous. I shook his hand, welcomed him, then needed to destroy everyone at code names while paying them zero attention. Halfway through the night, Tara cornered me. You don't even care that I'm here with someone else? Why would I? We're friends. Friends date people. She couldn't answer because there was no answer. That didn't admit she wanted me to pine for her while she found herself. But the best part, her bestie Marissa had been extra friendly all night. Kept finding excuses to talk to me, laugh at my jokes. This morning, Tara texted. What was that with you and Marissa? We were just talking. Friends talk. She's my best friend. And I'm your friend, too, right? Friends can be friends with each other's friends. By week three, Connor from yoga had ghosted Tara. Meanwhile, Marissa invited me to a comedy show. The date was fantastic. She was actually hilarious. Something I'd

Is Daisy Williams present in school today? My teacher, Missus Harrah, clicked the intercom button. Yes, the principal's voice echoed. Lockdown now. This is not a drill. The way he said it made my blood freeze. Missus Harrah shrieked under the desks. Lights off. Move, move, move. Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. I couldn't help but think he was after me. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Missus Harrah tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. Screaming got louder and it wasn't just one voice anymore. Multiple people in different parts of the building. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that the shooter was right outside and I believed them. Pia grabbed my hand and her palms were soaked with sweat. I could see Mister Kids class across the hall through our door window. Lights already off, no movement, just darkness where 20 kids should have been. I looked at our teacher for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids and told us it would be okay. But after a while, she got Up again and walked back to her laptop. Then we heard it, footsteps running past our door. Thud, thud, thud. I couldn't help myself. I had to look. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall, pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops. Get away from the door, Daisy. Missus Harrah whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Even Missus Harrah stood up slowly and crept to the door to check the window before opening it. That's when it flung open. The principal stood there with an actual cop who had his hand resting on his gun. You, Daisy, come with us. Immediately, my worst fear confirmed. The tutor had sent them or maybe they thought I was involved somehow. Missus Harra looked between them and me, confused. Get your things, honey, Missus Harra said. And that scared me more than anything because in three years of chemistry class, she'd never called me honey. Every single person was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack with shaking hands. The hallway was complete chaos. More cops than I'd ever seen in one place. I, I heard a paramedic shout, we're losing him. Move as he flew past us. My classmates were pressed against the door windows in every room, watching me get escorted by police like I was a criminal. They steered me to the main office but passed reception into the Conference room. The cop finally spoke. Your dad is here? Well, my parents are divorced and I hadn't seen him since I was 7. So now I was really confused. Dad. He grabbed me in a hug so tight I couldn't breathe and his whole body shook against mine. I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. My ex Marine father, who always encouraged me to be stoic and suppress my feelings was crying his eyes out. Sorry for what? What's happening? Is there a shooter? Are people dead? I pulled back to look at him and he held my face in both hands. His hands were freezing. There's no.

And I'm so proud of him. The call came through my commanding officer. Your son committed felony assault at his father's wedding. You need to get home now. I was on a base in Germany and hadn't seen my boys in eight months. Now my teenage son, who stopped wrestling because he hated hurting people, was facing charges for brutalizing a woman at the altar. After an 18 hour emergency flight, I. I headed to my ex husband's house, where my son was. The wife's dark blood was still stained by the driveway. I rang the doorbell. My ex husband, Conrad answered, his face twisted with rage. We're pressing charges. I'm not taking anyone's side until I see both, I said, pushing past him. The living room was a tribunal. Conrad's parents on the couch, his brother Potter by the fireplace, his sister Fen in the corner. The bride's parents standing like guard dogs. And in the center, the bride, Lauren, with a splinted nose, two black eyes, bandages across her face. She was crying, dabbing her eyes carefully around the swelling. And there, surrounded by this mob, sat my son. My fourteen year old, who refused to kill insects because he could have been born an ant. Who taught his little stepbrother origami. He sat perfectly straight, chin raised, looking me dead in the eyes with zero regret. He looked proud of what he did. Your Son destroyed our family. Conrad spat. Look what he did to her face! Lauren sobbed harder. He's an animal. They're trying him as an adult, right? Grandpa shook his head in disgust. I looked at my son. His knuckles were still bruised and swollen. There seemed to be no real excuse. But then I asked for his side of the story. He looked around the room slowly, taking in every face. Then he spoke, voice clear. You wanna know the truth? She's been molesting me for six months. That's why I did it. My world stopped, but the room exploded instantly. Liar! Disgust! Sting! How dare you? Lauren's face shifted for just a second before she wailed louder. He's making it up! I've been nothing but loving her mother stepped forward, pointing at my son. You evil little. But her father grabbed her arm, his face pale like he'd been expecting the. In the midst of all the chaos, my son pulled out his phone and swiped to his hidden photos. She said, fourteen year old boys always want it. Said I should be grateful. I saw the images over his shoulder and my stomach turned. Conrad's hands were shaking as he stared at the screen. Those could be anyone. Could have. But his voice was hollow, like he was reading a script. He didn't believe Lauren tried to snatch the phone. Those are out of context. I it was just. She stopped realizing. She just admitted they were real. My son stood up, voice shaking with rage. Dad, I told you three months ago. You said, she's just being affectionate. Conrad started stuttering. I didn't. I thought. Grandpa, you laughed. Lucky boy. Wish I had that problem at 14. Grandpa's face went from red to white. He looked at Lauren, then at his grandson, and something crumbled in his expression. Aunt Fenn, you told me. Don't be dramatic. Fenn was backing toward the door, tears streaming. Oh, god! Oh, god! I thought you were just Uncle Potter. You said I should be grateful. Potter had his head in his hands. Jesus Christ! I was joking. I didn't know she was actually grandma. You said boys can't be raped by women. Grandma collapsed into the couch, rosary beads in her hands, whispering prayers. Every single one of you told me to shut up about it. Lauren's parents were having a whispered argument. Her father hissed, not again, Patricia. You said she was better. The word again hung in the air. But that's not why I hit her. My son cut through.

When her future mother in law, Jennifer, stood up during the ceremony and announced she had something important to say, the entire church went silent. Mia's face went white. Jennifer walked to the front with the sick smile on her face and pulled out her phone. Before my son makes the biggest mistake of his life, everyone needs to see what kind of woman he's really marrying. He started playing a video on her phone, volume turned all the way up. It was Mia in a hotel room with another man in an inappropriate situation. The audio was crystal clear. Mia was sobbing, shaking her head, mouthing that's not me to her fiance Johnny. But the woman in the video looked exactly like her. Johnny's face went from confusion to rage in seconds. Is this real, Mia? Tell me this isn't real. Mia was hyperventilating, trying to speak, but nothing was coming out. Half the wedding guests were recording this with their phones. Her parents looked devastated. Jennifer was practically glowing with satisfaction. I hired a private investigator six months ago because I knew something was wrong with this girl. Johnny deserves better than a cheating woman. The church erupted in gasps and murmurs. Mia's grandmother had to be helped to her seat. That's when I noticed something. The time stamp on the video said last Tuesday, but I knew for a fact Mia was with me at my cousin's funeral. In Portland last Tuesday. We drove there together and stayed in the same hotel room. I grabbed Jennifer's phone and looked closer. The woman in the video had a butterfly tattoo on her shoulder blade. Mia doesn't have any tattoos. I've known her since we were 12, and I've seen her in bathing suits hundreds of times. This video is fake, I announced loudly. Mia was with me in Portland when this was supposedly filmed, and she doesn't have that tattoo. But Jennifer snatched her phone back and started screaming about how I was just covering for my trashy friend. The private investigator was there in the back row. Jennifer called him up to verify his evidence. This greasy guy in a cheap suit walked up front and started explaining how he followed me to the hotel. But when I asked him which hotel, he said, the Marriott Downtown. The problem? There is no Marriott Downtown in our city. There never has been. I pulled up Google

I had a severe stutter back then. Simple words like hello took me 30 seconds to get out. Most teachers were patient, but Mister Brennan saw it as a personal inconvenience. The daily humiliation started in October. He'd call me to the front during morning announcements and make me read the lunch menu allowed. The whole class would snicker as I struggled through pizza and chicken nuggets. Class, this is why we practice speaking clearly at home, he'd announce after I finished. Some people just don't put in the effort. My mom knew I was struggling, but I never told her the details. She was already working two jobs after my dad's accident left him unable to work. The last thing she needed was more stress. Mr. Brennan's favorite torture was calling on me to answer questions I clearly knew. I'd raise my hand enthusiastically. Then he'd watch me struggle for minutes before moving on to someone else. Anyone who can speak properly want to try? He'd say. The breaking point came during our Thanksgiving play rehearsal. I've been cast as a Native American chief with just one line. Welcome to our land. For weeks, I practiced with the speech therapist. During lunch, we worked on breathing techniques, rhythm patterns. I finally got the line smooth. The day before the performance, Mr. Brennan pulled me aside. I'm giving your part to Danny, you'll be tree number three instead. No lines. But I can say it now. I protested. I practiced every day. I won't risk you embarrassing the school in front of all those parents. That night, I cried myself to sleep. My mom found me still awake at midnight. What's wrong, sweetheart? I finally broke down and told her everything. The daily humiliations. Lunch menu torture, losing my part in the play. My mom's face went through about five different emotions before settling on pure rage. Get dressed, she said. We're going to school. Mom, it's midnight. I don't care. She drove straight to the principal's house. Yes, his actual house. She knocked until he answered the door in his pajamas. We need to talk now. Principal Martinez invited us in, probably too shocked to refuse. My mom had brought a notebook where she'd been tracking my speech progress at home. Show him. She

If you're crying in a public bathroom, every woman becomes your temporary sister until you're okay, no questions asked. I Learned this when a stranger saved me from my abusive ex by pretending to be my best friend. I was 22, trapped in a relationship with Marcus, who controlled everything, my clothes, my friends, where I could go. He'd track my location and time my errands down to the minute. If I was five minutes late from the grocery store, I'd get interrogated for hours about who I'd talk to and why I was really gone so long. That night, we were at a crowded sports bar with his friends. I'd asked to use the bathroom and he'd said I had exactly three minutes before he'd come looking for me. I wasn't crying because I was sad. I was crying because I'd finally admitted to myself that this wasn't normal and I had no idea how to get out. I was standing at the sink trying to fix my makeup before going back when a girl about my age walked in. She took one look at me and immediately went into action. Hey, are you okay, she asked, but not in that polite way people usually ask. She actually wanted to know. I'm fine, I lied, but my voice cracked. No, you're not. What's wrong? Something about her tone made me break. My boyfriend, he's just really controlling. I can't even Go to the bathroom without him timing me. Her expression hardened. Is he here now? I nodded. Table 12, the guy in the blue shirt who keeps checking his phone. She peeked out the bathroom door, then came back with this determined look. Okay, here's what we're going to do. I'm about to become your best friend from college who you haven't seen in forever. You're going to act surprised and excited to see me. We're going to hug, catch up loudly, and I'm going to insist you come sit with me and my friends for just a few minutes to meet everyone. I can't. He'll get angry if I don't come right back. That's exactly why you need to do this. Trust me. Before I could argue, she was pulling me out of the bathroom. Her arm linked through mine like we've known each other for years. Oh, my god, Sarah, she squealed loud enough for half the bar to hear. I can't believe it's you. How long has it been? I stood there frozen for a second before realising she was giving me an out. Jessica, what are you doing here? Marcus looked up from table 12, clearly confused about who this person was and why I was suddenly animated and smiling. Jessica kept up the performance perfectly. I'm here with my friends from work. You have to come meet them just for like 10 minutes. I have so much to catch up on. She was already guiding Me toward a table full of women who somehow all immediately understood the assignment. They welcomed me like I was their long lost friend, asked about my job and family and made sure I was never sitting alone where Marcus could approach. After about 20 minutes, Marcus came over. Sarah, we need to go. Oh, you must be Marcus, Jessica said with fake enthusiasm. Sarah's told me so much about you. I'm.

I'm sitting at my reserved table at this fancy Italian place when a couple walks up and says, excuse me, you're at our table. I politely tell them I have a seven PM reservation under my name. The woman rolls her eyes and says, as well, we have one too and we were here first. I show them my confirmation email. The guy gets aggressive. Look, we eat here every week. The hostess knows us. You need to move, the woman adds. We tip really well here. They know to take care of us. I refuse and say I'm not moving for my confirmed reservation. The guy starts raising his voice. This is ridiculous. We're regulars. Other diners start looking over. The woman notices and it's louder. Can you believe this? Some people have no courtesy. I flag down our waitress, hoping she'll check the reservation system. She walks over looking nervous. The couple immediately pounces, thank god you're here. This person took our usual table. The waitress looks between us awkwardly, oh, there might have been a mix up. Maybe you could sit at the bar. The couple smurfs like they've won. The woman crosses her arms. See, even she knows this is our table. The guy adds, we've been coming here for three years, same table every Friday. I'm getting heated, but stay calm and ask the waitress to check her system. He hesitates and says, well, they Are very good customers, the woman jumps in. Exactly. We spend serious money here, not like some random walk in. I tell her I'm not a walk in and show my confirmation. Again, the guy dismisses it. Anyone can fake an email these days. The woman suggests, why don't you just go somewhere else? There are plenty of other restaurants. Other customers are now openly staring at the scene. One couple at the next table starts whispering. The waitress looks uncomfortable and suggests again, the bar has really nice seating, same menu. The guy nods approving. Perfect solution. Everyone's happy. I refuse to budge and ask to speak to the manager. The woman laughs. Oh, please. He knows us personally. The guy adds. We had dinner with him last month. Good luck with that. The waitress says the manager is busy in the kitchen. The couple exchanges knowing looks. The woman leans in. Look, we can make this easy. Easy or hard, your choice. I ask what that means. The guy explains, we know the owner. One word from us and you'll never get a table here again. I stand my ground and say I'm keeping my legally reserved table. The couple gets more aggressive. The woman starts talking to nearby tables. Can you believe some people? No respect for loyalty? The guy joins. In three years we've been coming here, this is what customer service has become. A man at another table nods sympathetic. The woman turns back to Me, last chance, move or we'll make sure everyone knows how selfish you are. That's when I pull out my phone and call the restaurant right there in front of everyone. Hi, this is Johnny. I made a reservation for seven PM under Johnson. There's some confusion about my table. The couple's confidence wavers slightly. The guy I whispers, what is he doing? The hostess who seated the couple answers. I put it on speaker so everyone can hear. Oh, Mister Johnson, yes, table 12 is definitely yours. Wait, someone else.

I discovered my wife was cheating when the kids mentioned Uncle Steve. Have been helping mommy feel better at night. The betrayal hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, but I knew staying would destroy me, so I filed for divorce. During the proceedings, I practically begged her to be reasonable about custody. She looked me in the eyes and said, I would never keep your children from you for six months. She actually kept her word, and we fell into this decent routine where we'd exchange the kids every Friday without any drama. She'd even text me little updates about their school days, and we managed to sit together at their soccer games like normal divorced parents. But then I pulled up for my regular Friday pickup, and there was a for sale sign in the yard, and the house was completely empty. I actually fell to my knees on their lawn because I knew she'd done it. She'd actually taken my kids. I called her phone over and over, but it just rang. When I gave up, I noticed the notification for a voicemail that came at 6:00am. Her voice was casual, saying, we've relocated to Seattle for Steve's job, and the kids are already enrolled in school. Like she was telling me about changing their soccer practice time. I sat in that driveway for an hour, dissociating, because she'd been planning on moving 3,000 miles. Away for months while looking me in the eye every Friday. The next morning, a process server handed me court papers claiming I was an absent father who prioritized work over my children. And I realized she'd also been documenting my business trips, kept calling and texting, begging to just hear my kids voices. It actually took three days for me to get through to her. She answered, and instead of explaining anything, she offered monthly video calls like she was being generous.

Reverse. My fiance called off our wedding three days before the ceremony when I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. I found out during a routine check up just weeks before our wedding day. When I showed him the test results, his face went completely blank. That night, he told me he couldn't handle this right now and that maybe we should postpone everything until you're better. I was devastated, but tried to understand. The next morning, he came over with his parents. Instead of support, they handed me a folder containing receipts for all the wedding expenses they'd contributed. His mother coldly said, since you're canceling, we expect reimbursement. I was speechless. My fiance couldn't even look me in the eye when he said, I'm sorry, but I didn't sign up for this. I wanted a wife, not a patient. He took his ring back and left. I was completely broken. My parents were furious, but focused on helping me through treatment. My sister postponed her semester abroad to be my caregiver. My friends organised a schedule to drive me to appointments. My workplace gave me flexible hours. Three months into my treatment, I received a text from my ex. He'd met someone new and they were already engaged. He wrote, she's everything I wanted. Healthy, vibrant and drama free. I'm finally getting the life I deserve. I didn't respond. I focused entirely on my recovery. The chemo was brutal. I found strength. I Never knew I had. My medical team was amazed by my body's response to treatment.

Because like I feel so unimportant in other people's lives. I don't feel loved, liked or even wanted around. Everyone I know can go days without talking to me or even noticing I'm gone. I feel like I'm easily replaceable and there's nothing I can do about that. I'll never be anyone's first choice, let alone second or third. In fact, does everyone see me as a burden? Nothing but an annoyance to talk to? And no, I won't tell anyone privately about this because what if someone starts talking to me out of pity because they feel obligated to? In fact, just telling you all this makes me feel like I'm begging for attention. I just wanna feel appreciated. Like my presence is enjoyed by someone. Like someone will notice when I'm gone. Someone will reach out to me when I seem quieter than usual. Someone will care about me even when I feel unlovable. Just someone, please. Anyways, bye. This is trend hopper 1:01. Signing out. I hope no one else feels this way about themselves.

In my family, we had something called Health Day. Every Saturday morning at 9:00am sharp. We'd finish breakfast and dad would already have the basement ready with his white coat on and all his medical equipment laid out on metal trays in the basement. Our mom would kiss our foreheads before sending us down one by one. Then came the examinations, thorough inspections of every inch of our bodies while he muttered medical terms and scribbled in thick glue binders. He'd make us stand naked under the bright lights while he circled us slow, his gloved fingers pressing into our skin, checking what he called abnormalities. He called it preventive care. I dreaded it. Every single week. The rule was you couldn't flinch or complain or you'd start over from the beginning. The strangest part, we weren't allowed to mention health day at school, not to teachers, not to friends. I only realised in middle school how weird that was, how other kids just went to pediatricians once a year, not secret basement clinics every week. But the worst part was the special examinations. If dad found something concerning during the regular check, you'd get called down on weeknights. He had this small locked room with bright lights and an exam table with stirrups. The metal was always cold and he'd spend what felt like hours with his instruments documenting every detail while telling us to relax and breathe. He said it was For comprehensive assessment, the kid, I was terrified. I'd count the ceiling tiles over and over. But dad said fear meant you were taking your health seriously. When I got older, I started questioning everything. Why did we need weekly exams when no one else did? Why did mom drink before every health day? I remember once at 14, I asked if I could skip it for Rachel's sleepover. Dad gripped my wrist and stared at me with these desperate eyes. Health day is the only thing keeping you safe, he said. That's when I knew something was deeply wrong. Rachel's family had annual checkups, vaccinations, schedules, growth charts on the fridge. No basement procedures, no locked rooms, no binders documenting their bodies, just normal healthcare. I finally refused to go downstairs when I turned 16. Dad went ballistic, screaming that I was ungrateful and didn't understand the dangers. Mom just stood there shaking. He locked me in my room and said I couldn't leave until I submitted to a full examination. The next morning, mom slipped me $20 under the door and whispered to use the window. When I came back that night, dad acted like nothing had happened. He just asked if I was ready for my examination like he hadn't imprisoned me the night before. That's when I started planning. The whole thing ate at me. Why was dad so obsessed with our health when he wasn't even a doctor? Where did he get all that equipment? Three months later, I told my health teacher everything. Mrs. Patterson kept her face very still as I explained our Saturday routine. She said she needed to make a phone call. I knew what that meant. She came back with the principal. Then the police came, then child services. They took us out of class one by one, just like health day, except this time we didn't go home. I'll never forget Dad's face when they arrested him. Not angry, just broken. I was protecting them, he kept saying. The officers found the binders, dozens.

My parents told everyone they had triplets. I was the fourth, the backup child they kept hidden in case something happened to the others. I lived in the basement, watching my siblings lives through security cameras. They'd sneak down at night to bring me food and teach me what they Learned at school. On our 13th birthday, when the others got cake upstairs, they brought me a single candle. Make a wish to get out, they whispered. But how do you escape when you don't officially exist? Basement became my whole world. The day we came home from the hospital, while my siblings got birth certificates, I got a storage room with a mattress. Mom explained it simply. Insurance covers three babies. Four would bankrupt us. But we're keeping you safe down here, just in case. Just in case what? I didn't understand then I watched my siblings grow up on a flickering monitor. First steps, first words. First day of school. They were labelled on the screen. Lily, camera 1. Emma, camera 2. Olivia, camera 3. I didn't have a camera. I didn't have a name. Mom called me spare when she remembered to bring food. The insurance papers were kept in a lock box by my bed. I Learned to read from those documents. Maximum coverage for triplet birth $2.8 million. Quadruplet birth $50,000 total. Beneath that, another paper that made my stomach twist. Rare blood type O negative. Universal donor. Perfect Match probability among identical siblings 100%. My siblings discovered me by accident when we were 5. They've been playing hide and seek. When Emma found the basement door, three identical faces stared at me through the crack. Are you our ghost? Lily whispered that night. They came back every night after that, too. They'd wait until our parents started snoring, then creep down with whatever they could steal from dinner. Olivia taught me to read better. Emma showed me math. Lily brought down her drawings and taped them to my walls. Why don't you live upstairs? They asked. Because I'm the emergency one, I said, repeating what I've been told. They didn't understand. Neither did I, really. Not until Olivia got sick. She was 8 when the doctors found problems with her kidney. I watched on the monitors as our parents pace the living room. We have options, mom said. We've been smart. We've been prepared. That night, my siblings didn't come down. I could see them on the screens, huddled in their room, crying. The next morning, dad came to the basement with a medical kit. Just some tests, he said. Standard stuff. The needle hurt. The blood vials filled one by one, six of them. Then he checked my eyes. My reflexes pressed on my stomach, where my kidneys were. Perfect, he muttered. Absolutely perfect. Olivia got better with medication. The basement door locked from the outside. After that, my siblings started leaving me notes under the door. We're trying to find a way. We won't let them hurt you. You're our sister. Not spare parts. Years passed in that basement. I exercised to stay healthy. Had to keep the spare parts in good condition. Stuff from old textbooks my siblings smuggled down. I watched them go to school, make friends, and live lives. Every birthday, three candles upstairs, one candle downstairs. Same wish every year. When we turned 12, Emma broke her arm so badly, the bone came through the skin. On the monitor, I watched our parents exchange looks. Dad's hand went to his pocket, where he kept the basement key. No, I whispered to the empty room. Please, no. But Emma's arm healed clean. The key stayed in his pocket. The worst part wasn't the isolation. It wasn't eating scraps or sleeping on concrete. It was watching my sister's live. Knowing I existed only as their backup. Their walking medical supply. A ghost child waiting to be harvested. They tried to tell someone. Once. Lily broke down to a teacher about her other sister. The school called our parents. That night. I watched mom explain about Lily's imaginary quadruplet. A trauma response to being a triplet. So creative, so troubled. Therapy was recommended. The lock on my door got upgraded to digital. On our 13th birthday, I sat in the dark, listening to the party upstairs. Laughter, music. The voices of kids I'd never meet. When midnight came, my sister snuck down with a cupcake. They hidden one candle flickering in the darkness. Make a wish, they said. Tears streaming down three identical faces with to get out. We're going to help you. We promise. I closed my eyes, blew out the candle, wished for the only thing I'd ever wanted. To exist. But when morning came, I was still in the basement. Still watching their lives through grainy screen. Still the emergency child despair parts. The ghost in the basement that only three people in the world knew was real. Mom came down that afternoon with the medical kit again. More tests, more vials of blood. Just checking everything's working properly, she said. Can never be too prepared. She paused at the door, looking back at me. You know you're loved, right? We kept you. We could have given you away, but we kept you. That's love. The door locked behind her. The red light linked. At that moment, I knew I had a decision to make. One that would not only change my life, but the lives of my triplets forever. Full story on channel link below.

My daughter had asked to sleep in my room for the third time in a row. She's five, so I assume she was having nightmares, or maybe she was going through a clingy phase. When she asked for the fourth time, I said yes, and as I was tucking her in, I asked why she kept asking to sleep in my room. She couldn't look at me as she told me, because Mommy's friend gets into bed with me when you're gone. Her words didn't fully register at first. I asked her what she meant, and she repeated it, adding that Mommy says it's okay because he's like family. I couldn't sleep at all that night. The next morning, I told my wife what our daughter had said and asked if anyone had been over recently. She brushed it off almost instantly, laughing a little and saying our daughter probably meant a stuffed animal or had made something up. She said, you know how kids are and change the subject. The way she said it was off, as if she was prepared for that question and had her answer ready. A few days later, I told her I had to leave town for a short work trip. In reality, I stayed in a nearby hotel and logged into the security cameras I had installed last year after a neighbor's house had been broken into. I'd almost forgotten they were even still. Active the next day. I got a motion alert around nine thirty PM from the hallway camera. I opened the feed. I saw a man I didn't recognize. He kissed my wife, who entered our bedroom right after. But the man kept walking through the hallway and went straight into my daughter's room. He just walked in like he belonged there. And my wife was fine with it. I was so scared for my daughter. I instantly got in my car and drove straight home. When I walked through the door, I didn't say a word. Not even when my wife popped out of our room and nervously asked me what I was doing back home so early. I pushed past her and went into my daughter's room. I turned the light on.

When Premium Towing kept my car after I tried to get it back three times, I decided to become their best customer. I parked my car, a white Lexus, in the same spot I pay $180 monthly for. But then I woke up the next day and the car was gone, replaced by a towing sign. Called the towing company. The guy sounded surprised. You have a monthly permit. That's definitely a mistake. Come down with your documentation and we'll release it right away. No charge for errors. Took it Uber there, different person at the window. That's $400 for release. But someone just said no charge for mistakes. I don't know who told you that. It's $400. Slightly annoyed, but figured I'd try again. Came back next day with bank statements, new woman, really sympathetic. Oh, this is terrible. You're absolutely right. Let me get my manager. Manager looked at my papers. Sorry. Once it's in our system as a violation, I can't change it, but I'll waive the storage fees if you pay now just $400. Now I was pissed. You want to illegally tow my car and then claim you're doing me a favor by only making me pay $400? Alright, game is on. I had 3 weeks of vacation time left and what better way to use it than to teach these people a lesson. The next morning I called them back, but Not to talk about my car, to request their services. Hi, I need a tow truck at 4, 25 ginger street. There's an abandoned car blocking my driveway. 20 minutes later, their truck shows up. The driver spent half an hour searching for a non existent address because I'd given him a fake house number. As soon as he returned, I called again. Sorry, I meant 4:52 ginger. My mistake. The driver went back out another 30 minutes wait. That afternoon I called again. There's a car with hazards on blocking the fire lane at Costco. Needs immediate towing. They dispatched immediately because fire lanes mean big money. The driver searched the entire Costco parking lot for 45 minutes. No car. I started mapping out their response patterns. Morning shifts had two trucks, afternoon had 3. Each call cost them gas time and made them miss actual real jobs. On day three, I expanded my operations. A Camaro with flat tires and handicapped spot at target, no plates. Spent an hour searching a challenger. Looks abandoned at the mall. Been there for days. Another hour wasted. By the end of week 1 1, I'd made 17 false calls, each one during peak hours, each one sending them to opposite ends of the city. Then they started recognizing my voice. Is this about your Lexus? What Lexus? There's an illegally parked truck at. They hung up on me before I could finish. I recruited some backup. My poker buddies, my gym. Friends, even my neighbor Tom was eager to help. Once he heard what I was doing, he personally called about a luxury car blocking his driveway and kept them there for 90 minutes, insisting it had just been there, maybe they missed it, telling them to check again. We had 15 people rotating calls, sometimes five a day, sometimes 10. The dispatcher started screaming at anyone calling about towels. Their Yelp reviews tanked from angry real customers who couldn't get through. My spreadsheet showed we cost them around 8,000 in wasted operations. My phone rang while I was scheduling the next wave of fake calls. Mr Taylor, this is Jack Torino. I own Premium Towing. Finally, someone who doesn't follow a script. Hi, Jack. His voice was tight, like he was grinding his teeth. My dispatcher tells me we've responded to 43 false calls. It's a federal crime. In case you didn't know, I already knew how to respond. Can you prove they were false? I genuinely believed those cars needed towing, just like your driver genuinely believed my legally parked car needed towing. He went silent, but I could hear him breathing heavily, almost like he was trying to control his anger. You're that guy from the garage, the one with the Lexus, the one your employees lie to three times? Yeah, that's me. More heavy breathing. Look, you're destroying my business. My. The drivers are threatening to quit. We're hemorrhaging money. What the hell do you want his Voice cracked on the last part. Simple. My car returned immediately, no charge, written apology admitting the illegal tow and refunds for everyone you've illegally towed from my garage. Jesus Christ, do you know what you're asking? That could be dozens of people. I just laughed in response. Then you shouldn't have illegally towed dozens of cars. Another pause. When he spoke again, his voice was defeated. Alright, your car will be back within the hour. Keys in the visor and I'll review the other toes from that location. My car was back in its spot within 40 minutes, washed and detailed with a formal apology letter on the dashboard. But that that was just the beginning. Over the next two weeks, 14 neighbors got refund checks for illegal toes. Total returned, $6,200. My neighbor Susan cried when she got her $400 back, said premium had towed her three times last year from her paid spot. But the best part came a month later when I saw in the local paper the premium lost their city contract after an investigation into predatory practices. Jack's trying to sell the business now posted on Craigslist. No buyers.

My mother is cheating on my father and my father is cheating on my mother. They both know I know this but made me promise not to tell the other parent. Parents are fucked up sometimes. 2, that my dad paid my mom $1,500 for full custody of my youngest sibling. Not only would this be a massive blow to my sibling, but my dad remarried quite quickly and the new wife is the very definition of an evil stepmom. If my sibling knew that our mom gave her up for such a small sum of money and the trade off was 5+ years of abuse, she would be destroyed. 3. When I was a kid, I used to shit in a tire in the garden because I was scared of getting locked in the toilet. 4, I sharted on a New Year's party bus a few years ago. I thought it was just a fart, but it was a small shotgun blast of fluid. I stayed calm and threw away my undies at the next bar. Luckily, there was little or no shit on the inside of my jeans and I was able to continue the night with no one aware of my poop. Crime. 5. I agreed to a first date with someone to make him stop crying. Six years later, we're happily engaged and doing great. I don't know how well He remembers that, but I'm not bringing it up. 6, I attempted to murder my mother. She was abusive verbally but also physically. She'd hit you in places no one would see or rip clumps of my hair out when dad was on the road for work. She probably has a personality disorder. She got in my face one night when I was coming home from my second job and I had it. My mom like went through whole periods where she wouldn't work. I was killing myself every summer working 50+ hours to pay family bills in my parents names and also get my younger sister to all of her activities. I had, I t I tried to put mom's head through a wall.

One, I teach 7th graders. Most of them think that they will be making 200 k per year. They can't even read a grade level. Many of them think they will make it big on YouTube. 2, that influencers live the lives they post. 3, that punctuation and grammar doesn't matter. Basic literacy, the lack of writing skills is appalling. I was once called a bigot for saying that people can and will make judgments about your intelligence and take you less seriously for bad writing. 4, that everything has to be labeled. Enjoying a tidy house is an OCD. Having a song stuck in your head is an ADHD. Preferring to be in your own company is an autism. Your parents getting frustrated because you won't tidy your room isn't abuse. Feeling sad for a couple of days isn't depression. Preferring texting over calling isn't anxiety. Your friend that happens to be gay doesn't need to be known as your gay friend at all times. 5. You're allowed to type words like kill, gun, suicide, etc. It's not illegal.

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She'd put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning, after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day, I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling washed over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy, and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he Was one afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, he said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

My girlfriend was so insane that she told everyone that we broke up because I cheated on her in her dream. She was a spoiled rich girl who came from a terrible snobby family. They were the kind of people who would wipe their butts with hundred dollar bills if they ran out of toilet paper. If she and I ever got into an argument, she would run back to her daddy who would send her on a week long vacation to Cancun just so she could recover from our arguments. During one of these week long vacations to Cancun, she ended up getting pregnant from one of the six hotel staff she cheated on me with. But when she came back, instead of telling me, she told me that she was breaking up with me because she had a dream in Mexico that I would cheat on her. At this point I was so over the relationship that I didn't care if it ended. After I moved out and moved back to my parents house, I got a call from an anonymous number. When I I picked up the phone, it was my ex girlfriend's father. He called to say, you broke my baby girl's heart. Now I'm going to break your head. I'd sleep with one eye open if I were you. I told him whatever and for him and his crazy family to leave me alone. Truthfully, I was scared. Of him, I knew he had enough money to hire whoever he wanted to do whatever he wanted. When I applied for a new job, I noticed someone was watching me at the office. They weren't just watching me, they were staring. When I left the building, I saw them following behind. I started to look around, and that's when I saw a black van with two men inside it, also watching me. I've seen enough movies to know what that meant. I didn't waste any time. I started running as fast as I could. I ended up running into a park where I found a police officer. I alerted him and told him that I was being followed by three men. I thought that he would help me, but instead he told me to put my hands behind my back and that I was being arrested. I demanded that he tell me why I was being arrested, but he told me to shut my broke ass up. The second he called me broke, I realized that this was all my ex's father I was doing. He paid the cop off to arrest me. At this point, I didn't even fight back. The cop put me in his cop car, and just as I thought, he brought me to my ex girlfriend's estate. When he threw me out of the car, my girlfriend's father was waiting for me, sipping tea like a James Bond villain. I asked him if he Was going to take my life away. And all he said was, we need to talk. I followed him inside and passed by my girlfriend, who was getting her feet done. Her father sat me down and there was trembling in his voice. My babe

What is something you wish your father knew about girls when you were growing up? When I turned 12, my dad started acting like I had some contagious disease. Before that, we were super close. He taught me how to ride a bike, took me fishing every Saturday, and we'd watch old action movies together while eating way too much popcorn. But the second I hit middle school, everything changed. First I thought maybe I did something wrong, like when I accidentally broke his favourite coffee mug, or when I forgot to feed our dog Bruno for two days straight. But this felt different. He'd walk into the kitchen, see me making cereal, and suddenly remember he had important phone calls to make. If I tried to hug him goodbye before school, he'd pat my shoulder awkwardly and say something about being late for work. The weirdest part was how he stopped looking at me. Like, actually looking at me. During dinner, he'd stare at his plate or ask my little brother about soccer practice, but never asked me about my day. When I got my first period and mom had to explain everything, I could hear him turn the TV volume up really loud in the living room, like he was trying to drown out our conversation. I started thinking maybe this was normal. Maybe all dads acted weird around their teenage daughters. But then I'd see my friend Jessica's dad joke around with her or watch my Uncle give my cousin Emma piggyback rides even though she was 15. That's when I knew something was off with us. The breaking point happened on a Tuesday night in eighth grade. I was in my room changing into pajamas after soccer practice, and I had just pulled off my sweaty Jersey when my door flew open. No knock, nothing. Dad stood there for, like, three seconds before his face went completely red. I screamed and grabbed my shirt to cover myself. Instead of apologizing, he got mad. It's my house, he said, his voice all defensive and angry. Don't act like it's some big crime. Then he slammed the door so hard, my picture frames rattled. We didn't talk for two days after that. Mom tried to smooth things over by saying dad was just stressed about work, but I knew better. I started pushing my dresser against my door every night before bed, and I Learned to change in my tiny closet where nobody could accidentally walk in on me. Around the same time, I got really good at hiding things. I kept my pads and empty cereal boxes under my bed because the idea of dad seeing them in the bathroom made me want to disappear. When I had cramps so bad I couldn't walk straight, I tell mom I had a headache instead of explaining what was really wrong. It felt safer to lie than to deal with Dad's weird reactions to anything girl related. Part was how he'd get angry about stuff that wasn't even my fault. Like when I got my period during our family barbecue and blood through my white shorts. I was already embarrassed enough, but dad made it 10 times worse by yelling at me in front of his work buddies about being careless and not paying attention. I locked myself in the bathroom and cried until mom came to check on me. When my first boyfriend, Tyler, asked me to homecoming, dad grounded me for a month. Not because Tyler was a bad kid or anything, but because dad didn't want me ending up like cousin Rachel who got pregnant senior year. He acted like having a boyfriend automatically meant I was going to ruin my life, even though Tyler and I just held hands and shared French fries at lunch. Every time I tried to talk to him about how I was feeling, he'd shut me down or change the subject. When I cried after Tyler broke up with me over text, dad rolled his eyes and said, that's why you don't waste time on boys. No comfort, no asking if I was okay. Just this attitude like my feelings were stupid and dramatic. By junior year, we barely spoke unless he was lecturing me about my attitude problem. I Learned to keep my mouth shut and my problems to myself. When I got accepted to college across the state, I was honestly excited to get away from The tension in our house. I moved out the day after graduation. Didn't invite him to my college graduation ceremony. Four years later, when he called me dramatic for not including him, I just hung up. We went almost two years without talking.

Like you want me to be pregnant for 9 months? Bro I can barely survive school. Is there a build a baby shop? Cause I also low key want to customize my baby. Like yeah, I want the little curly hair and chubby cheeks combo. Maybe give them my sarcasm and someone else's math skills because I've been failing since birth. I don't wanna do the freaky either. Like why is that step even required? Why do I have to risk my soul insanity in a sweaty emotional situation just to unlock the baby starter pack? The fact people would know I did too. And the way people say but it's all worth it in the end. Like girl, that's what they say after surviving a car crash. You're not convincing me to grow a human like it's a house plant when I literally forget to feed myself some days. I'm not stable enough to be a life factory. why is no one talking about the fact that you don't even get a break after the baby's born? Like now you get to wake up every two hours and get screamed at by a bald roommate with anger issues. I just want the baby. I want to dress them like a minion and send them to preschool with a juice box. But I want to skip the pregnancy part. Skip the pain, skip the loading screen. Give me the kid. Just spawn them in. At this point every time I hear someone say I miss being pregnant, I start glitching. Miss what? The swollen feet? The back pain? Being built like a human recliner with a foot sticking out your ribs? No, cause at that point your body is not yours anymore. I don't even read the instructions on frozen waffles and now I'm supposed to build a whole human from scratch? And don't even get me started on baby names cause I already know I'd name my kid something adorable. And then he'd grow up to be a middle school menace with a mullet and a scooter. Who calls teachers by their first name? I'm not risking all that just to have my custom baby turn out like a Fortnite sweat who screams into a headset and tells other 12 year olds you're trash while I'm in the back crying over how I spent 9 months assembling this child just for him to rage quit over losing in Roblox Obby level 2. And the emotions! I crashed out yesterday because my charger fell behind the bed. Now imagine me pregnant.

When I was 12 years old, my mother slit her wrist in front of me because I asked to go to a friend's birthday party. And as she bled into our kitchen sink, she made me promise I'd never try to leave her again. She survived that time, barely. While the paramedics worked on her, she gripped my hand with bloody fingers and whispered, this is what happens when you abandon me. I spent three days in the hospital chapel, 13 years old and convinced. I almost murdered my mother by wanting to go to a sleepover. When she came home, arm bandaged and eyes hollow, she made me sleep in her bed so she could hold on to me all night. I need to know you're here, she said. Otherwise, the darkness comes back. The rules formed quickly after that. I couldn't join clubs because staying late at school feels like you're choosing them over me. I couldn't have friends over because their energy disrupts our bond. Each boundary came with the same threat, sometimes spoken, sometimes just a gesture toward her scarred wrists. He kept razors displayed on the bathroom counter like weapons, reminding me what would happen if I broke her heart again. By 14, I was homeschooled and completely isolated. Mom said it was better this way, just us two against a world that didn't understand our connection. She have good days where she braid my hair and We watch movies and I think maybe this was enough. But then I mention wanting to learn to drive someday and she'd go silent. She lock herself in the bathroom and I sit outside the door begging her to come out. She'd emerge hours later showing me fresh cuts on her thighs. Practice cuts she call them for when you finally abandoned me for real. I attempted my first real escape. At 15, I'd found a youth shelter address at the library and memorized it. One night while mom slept, I packed a bag and made it to the front door. But she was sitting in the dark living room waiting. I felt you pulling away, she said calmly. Then she swallowed an entire bottle of sleeping pills in front of me. I called 9 1 1 and rode with her to the hospital, holding her hand while they pumped her stomach. When she woke up, she smiled sadly. You did this, she said, but at least you stayed to watch. After that, she installed bells on my bedroom door and windows. She test me randomly, pretending to hurt herself to see if I try to leave or just save her. I always chose to save her, but I was dying inside, suffocating under the weight of keeping her alive. I started writing goodbye letters I never send, hiding them in my textbooks. I tried to get away again. When I was six. Mom had fallen asleep after taking anxiety Medication. And I thought I had time. I made it three blocks before a police car pulled up. Mom had called them claiming I was mentally unstable. She'd shown them my hidden letters as evidence. As they drove me home, she texted me, if you'd kept going, you would have found my body when you came back. I had the bath ready that night. She showed me a new scar on her stomach. I did this while you were gone, she said. She made me help her bandage it, narrating how she would have cut deeper if I made it another block. Next time you leave, she promised, I'll make sure I time it perfectly. You'll be free, but you'll be a murderer. I became. I'm hyper vigilant, watching for signs she was spiraling. My entire existence became keeping her from the edge. When I caught her standing on our apartment balcony at 3:00am, I didn't ask why. I just took her hand and let her back to bed. But then I got a scholarship to art school. Mom found the acceptance letter before I could hide it. She didn't say anything, just disappeared into the bathroom. I heard water running and pounded on the door. When she finally.

Wife panicked when reality hit. My wife dragged me to her book club's annual holiday party at Monica's house. I hate these things, but she insisted I come for moral support and to be social for once. The second we walked through Monica's front door, decorated with enough Christmas lights to power a small city, my wife spotted her crew and literally walked away mid sentence while I was still taking off my coat. I spent the first 30 minutes standing alone by the elaborate cheese spread, watching her pose for Instagram stories with her girlfriends. They were all dressed like they were hitting downtown clubs instead of discussing romance novels in suburbia. Looks like you're having about as much fun as I am, said a voice behind me. I turned to find Roxanne, my wife's newest friend from the group. Blonde, unconfident, always perfectly put together. The type who somehow makes everyone else feel underdressed just by existing. Oh, you know me, I said, grabbing another cracker. Life of the party. She laughed. Actually laughed. Not the light chuckle people usually give. At least someone here has a sense of humor. I've been listening to 20 minutes of discussion about whether Christian Grey was problematic or misunderstood. We started talking about actual books instead of whatever surface level analysis was happening in the living room. She'd read everything from Murakami to McCarthy. Smart, articulate, and she Actually made eye contact when speaking. Your wife mentioned you're a writer, Roxanne said, leaning against the kitchen counter. I'd love to read something of yours sometime. I bet you have interesting perspectives. My chest tightened. My wife had never asked to read my work, not once in three years of marriage. I'd even want on a small literary contest last month, and she'd said, that's nice, before scrolling back to TikTok. She talks about my writing? I asked. Roxanne's expression shifted slightly. Well, she mentioned it once. Said you're always typing away in your office. She. Actually, now that I think about it, she never really talks about you during our meetings. Like, at all. That hit harder than it should have. I was invisible, even in conversations I wasn't part of. Roxanne must have seen something in my face because she stepped closer. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. No, it's fine, I said, though it wasn't accurate. Probably from across the room, I caught my wife glancing over while pretending to listen to Courtney's story about her divorce lawyer. Her eyes arrowed slightly, seeing Roxanne and me talking. Roxanne noticed, too, and smiled. Well, well. Looks like someone finally remembered you exist. My wife looked away quickly, laughing too loudly at whatever Courtney had said. You know what's fun? Roxanne said, moving even closer. I always wondered what her mysterious husband was like. She acts like she's single half the time. Tonight, I'm right here. I Said surprising myself with the edge in my voice. Roxanne's smile turned predatory. Yes, you are. She glanced toward the living room where my wife was now openly staring at us, her conversation with Courtney completely forgotten. Should we give her something to actually notice? Roxanne whispered and raised her voice just enough for the nearby wives to hear. You know what? Forget about her tonight. You're mine now. The effect was immediate. Conversation stopped. Heads turn. My wife appeared beside us faster than I thought humanly possible. Her face flushed red. What did you just say to my husband? She demanded, her voice carrying across Monica's kitchen. Roxanne shrugged with practiced innocence. Just keeping him company, since you seem so busy with your friends. My wife grabbed my arm like she was claiming territory. We're leaving right now. But you haven't even talked to Monica yet, I said. Now! She hissed, already pulling me toward the door. The car ride home was 15 minutes of arctic silence. Finally, as we pulled into our driveway, she spoke. I can't believe Roxanne would flirt with you like that right in front of everyone. How embarrassing. I turned to look at her. How would you know what happened? You ignored me the entire night. Her mouth opened, then closed. The silence that followed told me everything I needed to know about our marriage.

Imagine your windows not going down all the way. Also, it was super uncomfortable, and there was no privacy at all. We were stopped at this traffic light, and this old man was staring at my dress because the bottom of the door is see through. I actually have a picture. That car looks older than my grandad. I know, right? It was so awkward. I don't know if he was looking at the car or my dress. I don't want random people seeing me. Uh, who were you dating? Some crypto nerd. He said he was the owner of this thing called Ethereum, but he couldn't afford a full window, and half of it was see through. What's even crazier is that he had such a lame name for his car. He called it McLaren Senna. It Wasn't even called Bens or something. Anyways, what do you think of this dress tonight? Yeah, it's alright. BTW, what's your ex's number? Why? I can check what fake car he had. Oh yeah. By the way, I can't make the date today. No need to reschedule.

That's basically full time. 40 hours is full time. You only work 39, you don't get any benefits. Either way, I need less hours. I can't keep working six days a week. I have classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so I would appreciate it if I could be off those days. Only full time employees get a set schedule. Since you're part time, I can't guarantee anything, but I'll see what I can do. Fine, but I'm telling you now, if I'm scheduled on Tuesday or Thursday, I'm calling in sick. Are you sure you can't be here during school? You can't tune in on a zoom or something? No. No one wants to work these days. Hey, I overheard you asking Alex if you wanted extra hours. I'm willing to take them if they're available. Are you part time or full time? Full time. You probably already have enough hours. I'm actually only scheduled to come in three days and work 25 hours this week. That's why I'm willing to pick up any extra hours. Maybe next week. We can't afford to give you any more hours this week. Hey, Alex, let me know if you want more hours, alright? I Want less? Wait. Would you wanna switch schedules? Yes. Hey, Frankie, put me down.

I worked in logistics at the shipping company for like eight years. Everyone called me the most chill guy there. I never got mad when people messed up my paperwork, never complained when they scheduled me for overtime last minute. Even when the coffee machine broke for two whole weeks and I was getting these awful headaches every afternoon, I just bought my own instant coffee and dealt with it. My supervisor, Todd, would always joke that I was made of chamomile tea or something. Every quarter I got these little certificates saying reliable and professional. I kept them in my desk drawer like some kind of weird trophy collection. Then HR came up with this brilliant new policy. Anonymous internal behaviour feedback. Basically, anyone could report anyone for being difficult or unprofessional. One report got you a warning. Two reports meant you lost your quarterly bonus. 3 reports and you were sitting in HR getting reviewed for termination. I wasn't worried. I mean, what was I gonna get reported for? Being too quiet? I literally helped train half the people on my team. When Ryan started 2 years ago, I taught him how to use the forklift, covered his shifts when his kid got sick, even helped him pass his safety exam by staying late to practice with him. But then I got my first warning email. Just sitting there in my inbox on a Tuesday morning. Like a punch to The gut. You have received an internal behavioral concern. Please review our workplace conduct policies. Stared at that email for, like, 10 minutes. I asked my desk neighbor, Kevin, if he knew what I could have possibly done. He just shrugged and said maybe someone was having a bad day and took it out on me. Two weeks later, another email. Same thing. Second internal behavioral concern received. I went straight to HR, asked Janet what exactly I was being accused of. She smiled that fake customer service smile and said they couldn't reveal specifics to protect the anonymity of the reporting process. She could tell me the general nature of the complaints. Apparently, I was making people uncomfortable with passive aggressive behavior and giving people hostile eye contact. Eye contact? I literally got reported for looking at people. I actually laughed out loud in her office. I asked her if she was serious. She said they take all workplace concerns very seriously and I should reflect on how my behavior might be affecting others. The third report came three days later. You have received three internal behavioral concerns. Please schedule a meeting with HR to discuss your continued employment. I printed out every performance review I'd gotten for the past eight years. All excellent ratings. Wrote this calm, professional response explaining that I had no idea what these reports were about. I even asked Kevin and two other co workers to write statements saying I was always professional and Helpful HR scheduled the meeting for the following Monday. Janet sat there taking notes while I presented my case. She nodded and smiled and said they'd review everything carefully by Friday. The promotion I've been expecting for months went to Ryan instead. That's when something clicked in my brain. I went to Best Buy that week.

When I turned 15, my mom went from strict to straight up paranoid. One night after dinner, she plopped down next to me with this weird smile and said she was installing a family safety app on my phone. I watched her tap away, giving herself access to everything. My location, photos, texts, even my drafts on social media. It's just to keep you safe, honey, she said, handing my phone back like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. It felt like having a stalker who lived in my house. At first I tried to be cool about it. Maybe it would calm her down, right? Wrong. Things got insane fast. She text me in the middle of conversations asking who I was with. She'd comment on memes I hadn't even posted yet because she was reading my drafts. Worst part? She started replying to my friends pretending to be me. My buddy Jake texted asking if I wanted to hang out, and my mom replied, sure thing, buddy! With way too many exclamation points. Jake called me laughing, asking why I was texting like a soccer mom. I had no idea what he meant until I checked my messages. Then came the day that broke me. I was in history class when Mrs. Wilson pulled me aside. She look uncomfortable as hell. Liam, your mother called the school. She's concerned about some message you sent about Me. My stomach dropped. I knew exactly what she meant. I texted my best friend Kyle the night before, joking about how our history teacher's haircut looked like she stuck her finger in an electrical socket. It was just stupid friend stuff, not meant for anyone else. But my mom had read it and called the school to complain about my private joke. I wanted to disappear into the floor. By lunch, Kyle wasn't talking to me. Neither was Jake. Word got around that my mom was reading everything, and suddenly nobody wanted to text me anymore. Some kids even blocked me. It was like my social life had a disease, and the disease was my mom. That night, I stared at my phone, feeling trapped. But then I noticed something. The tracking app worked both ways. It logged every time someone accessed the account. I spent hours studying those logs, and what I found made my skin crawl. My mom wasn't just checking my phone during the day. She was logging in at 1:00am, 2:00am, even 3:00am. She was forwarding my messages to her laptop. She was screenshotting my photos. He was living inside my phone 24 7. So I came up with a plan. I created a fake friend named Daniel, made up this whole persona, gave him a backstory, even found some random photos online to use as his profile pic on a group chat with myself. Then I started a long conversation with Daniel about this Epic party happening at some remote barn outside town. I made it sound exclusive, secretive, like something a paranoid mom would totally freak out about. I mentioned the address random dirt road I found on Google Maps that LED to absolutely nothing. I talked about how it was starting at midnight, how everyone was going to be there, how I couldn't wait to finally do something without my mom knowing. Then I put my phone down and waited. At 1:00am, the app logged that she opened the conversation. At 1:00am, I heard her bedroom Door Creek open. At 1:00am, I heard the garage door at

When I tried to correct my stepdaughter, I just smiled and said, alright. I'm Brandon, 38 and married to Samantha for three years. She has twin 12 year olds from her first marriage, Charlotte and Aiden. Their dad sends birthday cards twice a year if we're lucky. Last Tuesday, I caught Charlotte stealing 20 bucks from Samantha's purse. When I confronted her, she rolled her eyes and said, you're not my real dad. You can't tell me what to do. I calmly told Samantha what happened. Instead of addressing the theft, she got defensive. Don't lecture my kids about money. If you want a parent so badly, get your own children. That's dumb. But I just smiled and said, alright. See, what Samantha didn't know was that I've been covering their car insurance, phone bills and school supplies for months. While she struggled with debt, I'd also been quietly setting aside college funds for both kids. Four hundred dollars a month each straight into savings accounts they didn't even know existed. The next morning, I canceled everything. Car insurance, gone. Phone plan, terminated. The college accounts I'd opened, closed and transferred to my personal savings. I also stopped buying groceries. No more weekly 200 dollar trips to keep the pantry stocked. No more paying for their Netflix, Spotify or Charlotte's dance classes that cost me $150 a month. Aiden soccer registration fees, not my problem anymore. I even canceled the Family gym membership and stopped paying for their school lunches. Every subscribe, every monthly payment, every little expense I've been quietly handling, all of it gone. When Charlotte's phone got shut off at school and she couldn't call her friends, she came home furious. Why isn't my phone working? Ask your mom, I said, not looking up from my laptop. Aiden couldn't get picked up from soccer practice because as the car insurance had lapsed and Samantha's registration was expired, she had to leave work early, costing her overtime pay she desperately needed. That evening, Samantha panicked when she opened the fridge to find it nearly empty. The pantry was bare except for some stale crackers and a can of beans. Where's all the food? What happened to everything, she demanded, hands shaking as she looked at the empty shelves. I shrugged. You said, get my own kids so I'm focusing on the children who'll actually be mine someday. These aren't my responsibility anymore. You made that crystal clear. But Brandon, I didn't mean. You absolutely meant it. I interrupted. Charlotte stole from you. And instead of parenting her, you attacked me for caring. So I'm done caring. The look on her face was priceless, pure panic mixed with the dawning realization of just how much I've been carrying financially. Charlotte stormed into the kitchen. This is so unfair. You can't just stop paying for stuff. Watch me, I said. Only your mom made it clear, you're not my kids. So figure it out yourselves. Over the next week, reality hit them like a freight train. Samantha's paycheck couldn't stretch to cover what I've been handling. Charlotte's dance recital got canceled because the pain bounce Aiden soccer gear stayed dirty because no one had money for the laundromat. The twins started fighting, constantly stressed about their phones being dead and their friends asking why they couldn't hang out anymore. Charlotte couldn't even do her homework properly because I'd stopped paying for the internet. Samantha looked exhausted, working double shifts just to keep the lights on. Dark circles under her eyes, hair always messy, constantly stressed about making ends meet. The house felt different too. No more movie nights because no streaming services. No more.

I've been planning Miranda's dream Valentine's Day for weeks. When she destroyed me over brunch, I just pulled out my phone to confirm the reservation at the restaurant she'd been dying to try, when she interrupted me. God, you're so clingy and needy. We need to talk, she said, pushing away the flowers I'd brought. I can't do this anymore. It's suffocating. You're always trying to be romantic, always wanting to do couple stuff. My heart broke. We're about to be a year, Miranda. Exactly why we need to set boundaries now. From now on, we're best friends who happen to sleep together. Treat me exactly like you treat Nate or will. No flowers or special treatment. Just buddies. I'm just someone you have sex with. She said it like I was pathetic for wanting more. Next to us, looked horrified. If that's what you want, I said quietly. She rolled her eyes. Finally. Maybe now you'll stop being so desperate and embarrassing. Valentine's Day arrived. Miranda texted asking about if we had plans. I responded that I was going to Nate's to watch the game. She could come if she wanted. Dead silence for an hour. Didn't we have a reservation? She finally asked. I reminded her that I don't make romantic reservations for my buddies. That night, she showed up at Nate's in a red dress and heels. Handed her a beer without Looking up from the TV and went back to the game. When she tried to sit next to me on the couch, I pointed to the recliner across the room. Dude, you're blocking the TV! Nate looked confused. Miranda's face went red. She spent the night watching us play video games and talk about sports. Her birthday came three weeks later. I got her what I got all my bros. A six pack of beer and buffalo wings from the sketchy place near campus. Stared at the grease stained container like it was radioactive. Where's my actual gift? She asked, voice shaking. That is your gift. Same thing I got will last month. Pretty good wings, too. But I'm your girlfriend. No, you're my friend who I occasionally sleep with. Your exact words. Didn't speak to me for two days. The real entertainment started at her company Spring Gala. She begged me to come, bought me a suit, and said it was important for her promotion. When her boss approached asking how long we've been together, I corrected him immediately, oh, we're not together. Her boss looked bewildered, but she said you were her boyfriend of 10 months. Nah, she doesn't do the relationship thing. We're buddies who hook up occasionally. She was actually just telling me how suffocating real relationships are. Miranda grabbed my arm so hard it left marks. Her coworkers started whispering. At her cousin's wedding in may, the disasters multiplied when they called for couples photos. I stayed seated, playing on my phone. We're not a couple, just friends with benefits, I explained to the photographer, who asked three times if I was sure. During the slow songs, I was at the bar with other guys talking about basketball, while she stood alone on the dance floor. Her family kept asking if we'd broken up. I explained cheerfully that Miranda didn't want to be together, just friends with benefits. Her grandmother nearly fainted. Her mom pulled her aside for a long conversation about self respect and not letting men use you. By month three, she was getting desperate. She tried to hold my hand in public. I'd give her a fist bump instead. When she leaned in for a kiss at dinner, I went for the high five. Bros don't make out at restaurants, I said. The waiter smirked.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. After being homeless for two years, sleeping in parking lots, showering at truck stops, I finally saved enough to buy my own place. A small three bedroom house. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. The irony wasn't lost on me when I was homeless, begging them to let me park my camper in their driveway for just a few weeks. They called it an eye sore and told me to figure it out myself. My brother Dan actually laughed, calling me a homeless bum while his wife took pictures to mock me on social media. Now here they were, all four of them plus Dan's pregnant wife, going up at my door unannounced. They didn't even have my address. I never gave it to them. They must have followed me from work or something. Equally creepy. The moment I opened the door, they pushed past me like they owned the place. Dan's wife immediately started taking pictures again, but this time with dollar signs in her eyes. My parents were walking through my house like real estate agents, pointing at rooms, measuring spaces with their eyes, discussing which kid would get which bedroom. This is way too much space for just you, my mom declared, running her fingers along my kitchen. Counters. It's wasteful. My dad was already outside circling my property. Good luck. Size close to Dan's work, too. This will save us money on gas. That's when Dan pulled me aside into what used to be my peaceful living room. His wife and kids had already made themselves comfortable on my couch, feet up on my coffee table, tracking MUD across my carpet. Look, this is simple, Dan said, not even looking me in the eye. You don't need all this space. We're moving in next weekend. Can live in that camper out back. No discussion, no asking, no would you consider, or we'd really appreciate just informing me like I was a tenant getting evicted. The kids need stability, he continued. Olivia's pregnant again. We can't keep cramming everyone into mom and dad's place. I actually laughed. Absolutely not. That's when my mom marched back in from inspecting in my bedrooms. Daniel has four kids and another on the way. You're being selfish, living in all this space alone. My dad nodded from the doorway. It's time you helped family instead of just thinking about yourself. We raised you better than this. The audacity was breathtaking. These were the same people who wouldn't let me park in their driveway when I was literally homeless. Now they wanted to kick me out of my own house. I pulled out my phone and started recording. Let me get this straight. Do you want me to give up the house? I Bought with my own money. That I'm paying the mortgage on. So you can live here for free? We're not asking, Dan said, stepping closer like he was trying to intimidate me. We're telling you, family comes first. You owe us. After everything we've done for you. Everything you've done for me? I almost choked. You literally called me a homeless bum and refused to help when I was living in my truck. That was different. My mom snapped. You were irresponsible back then. Now you need to step up and do the right thing. Dan's wife finally spoke up from my couch. Besides, it's not

As she walked away, she loudly said, A guy like you should be grateful I even dated you. I smiled and calmly waited. Two hours later, she was begging me to come back. See, what Danielle didn't know was that I'd been planning to propose that night. The ring was literally in my jacket pocket when she started her little performance for her friends. I'd spent three months picking it out, saving up for my tech job, even asking her best friend what style she'd like. But here's the thing. Earlier that week, Danielle's marketing company had a complete system meltdown. Their servers crashed, client data was corrupted. Everything was chaos. Her boss, Edward, was panicking because they had a huge presentation for their biggest client. The next day, Danielle called me crying, begging for help. So I spent 14 hours straight rebuilding their entire network infrastructure, recovering lost files, and setting up new security protocols. I did it all remotely, working through the night while Danielle slept. When everything was fixed, Edward was so grateful, he told Danielle whoever solved this was getting a massive promotion and raise. The company had been about to lose their biggest account. Here's what Danielle didn't know. She had no idea I was the one who fixed everything. She thought they'd hired some expensive consultant because that's what Edward initially Told everyone before I asked him to keep my involvement quiet. I didn't want credit at her workplace. But Danielle being Danielle, immediately started taking credit. She told everyone she'd coordinated the technical response and managed the crisis. By the time I showed up for dinner, she'd apparently convinced half the office she was some kind of tech genius. Yes. So when she humiliated me in front of her friends, calling me a loser who should be grateful she dated me, I made a decision. I pulled out my phone right there at the table and sent one simple email to Edward. Hey, Edward, about that system fixed last week. Just wanted to clarify that Danielle wasn't involved in the technical. I handled the entire recovery personally as a favor to Danielle, but wanted to make sure credit went where it was due. Hope the Harris presentation went well. I attached screenshots of my remote access logs, knowing exactly when and how I'd fixed everything, along with the recovery scripts I'd written. Then I paid the 200 dollar Bill like a gentleman and went home. Two hours later, my phone started buzzing. Please call me. I can explain everything. I made a huge mistake then, and my boss wants to talk to you. What did you tell him then? I'm so sorry. We can work this out. Turns out Edward had called an emergency meeting the moment he got my email. He'd been suspicious about Danielle's sudden technical knowledge, but Hadn't questioned it. During the crisis, when he confronted her with my evidence, Danielle tried to claim we'd work together, that she'd

I think I'm making a mistake marrying you. I nodded, walked to my laptop, and canceled every single wedding vendor while she watched. Then I said, perfect timing. Now you won't have to worry about making a mistake anymore. What are you doing? She panicked. Exactly what you wanted, I replied, clicking through vendor after vendor. The catering? Canceled. The venue? Gone. The photographer? Done. She started crying. Steven, wait. I just meant I was having doubts. About marrying me? While texting your ex for six weeks? I interrupted pulling up her phone records I'd seen on our shared account that morning. Sean, right? Her face went white. You thought I didn't know? I've watched you smile at your phone every night for six weeks. I saw his name pop up during dinner last Tuesday, then Wednesday, then every single day since. I kept clicking. Florist? Canceled. DJ? Canceled. Rental company? Canceled. The flowers you picked out together? Gone. The playlist you spent and hours making with our songs? Delete it. The three tier cake with your precious initials carved in fondant? Someone else's problem now. Steven, please, can we just talk about this? We are talking. I'm talking about how you've been planning our wedding while secretly planning your exit strategy. I pulled up her text thread that I'd screenshotted weeks ago. Want me to read some highlights? I miss what we had, Sean. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if we tried harder. Steven's a good guy, but he's not you. She buried her face in her hands. You went through my phone? Our shared phone plan. Kimberly. Every message shows up on the account summary. Basic technology. I turned the laptop screen toward her. $8,000 in deposits, completely gone. But that's still cheaper than hiring a divorce lawyer in two years. I never meant for this to happen. It just started as innocent, friendly conversation. Innocent? I scrolled through more messages, reading them aloud. You told him you dream about him every night. You said marrying me felt like settling for safe. You literally asked if he'd fight for you if you called off the wedding. Her crying stopped abruptly. The room went dead violent. That's right, sweetheart. I read that one, too. You were hoping he'd dramatically show up and stop the ceremony, weren't you? Like some cheesy romantic comedy movie where the girl gets off her feet. I continued the cancellation spree methodically. The string quartet you insisted we needed canceled your entire extended family's hotel reservations, canceled the rehearsal dinner at that ridiculously expensive steakhouse you absolutely had to have gone forever. My whole family flew in from Portland, Steven. What am I supposed to tell them now? Tell them the truth. Tell them you chose Sean over me, because that's exactly what you did when you started this emotional affair. I closed the laptop with a satisfying snap. Tell Sean he can have you, but he's paying for his own damn wedding. She just sat there in stunned silence, slowly realizing her romantic backup plan was now her only remaining plan. You know what the really funny part is? I genuinely would have worked through normal doubts with you. I would have postponed the wedding if you just been honest about your feelings. But instead, you chose to have a full blown emotional affair. I grabbed my keys and

I've been the family disappointment for 23 years, while my perfect older brother, Kyle got everything handed to him. When Grandpa died and left me his house in his will, dad absolutely lost it. There's no way that senile old man left you anything, he snarled, pacing around our kitchen like a king aged animal. You're probably not even my real son anyway. Your mother was sleeping around before we got married. My brother Kyle smirked from the corner. Yeah, remember how wild mom was back in college? Dad's got a point. My stepmother Linda chimed in with that fake sweet voice she always used. Honey, we just want what's fair for the real family. You understand, right? They gave me 48 hours to take a paternity test or they challenge the will in court. The whole extended family was already texting about it in the group chat, calling me a fraud and a bastard. Here's what none of them knew. I've been secretly taking care of Grandpa for the past two years while they all ignored him. Every single doctor's appointment when his arthritis got bad. Every grocery run when he couldn't drive anymore. Every lonely evening when he just wanted someone to talk to about grandma. I also knew about the second will he'd written just three months before he died. The next morning, dad changed the locks on Grandpa's house. When I showed up with my key. I couldn't get in. My stuff was piled on the front lawn in garbage bags. You're trespassing! Dad yelled from the window. This is family property until you prove you belong here. I called the police. Within an hour, Officer Ortiz was standing in the driveway reading the will. Sir, according to this legal document, your son owns this property. You're the one trespassing. Dad's face went red as they made him give me the new keys. The neighbors were all watching from their windows. Test day arrived at the family lawyer's office. The whole crew showed up like it was some kind of Celebration. Dad wore his best suit and kept checking his Rolex, probably already planning how to spend what he thought would be his inheritance money. Kyle brought his new girlfriend to show off. You're about to see how we handle fake family members, he told her loudly. Linda kept taking selfies, probably planning to post about their victory later. Uncle Robert and Aunt Deborah drove in from two states away just to witness my humiliation. The family group chat had been buzzing for days about this showdown. The DNA results came back after the longest hour of my life. 99.9% match. I was definitely Dad's biological son. Dad's victory dance and high fives with Kyle lasted exactly 10 seconds. However, the lawyer continued clearing his throat. There's something else the family needs to know about. Your grandfather actually left a second, more recent will that supersedes The first one, the room went dead silent. You could hear Linda's phone camera clicking. I pulled out my phone and played a video I'd recorded with Grandpa just weeks before he passed. His shaky but determined voice filled the entire office. To my son Harold and his family, who abandoned me in my final years, who only called when they needed money.

I didn't receive anything. My grandmother's face darkened as she turned to my parents. The fifteen thousand dollar graduation trip to Europe I sent for Diego three months ago. The silence was deafening. My mom started fidgeting with her new designer purse, the one that mysteriously appeared last month along with matching shoes. My dad's gold chain suddenly felt heavier around his neck. And I noticed his expensive watch for the first time. We. We thought it would be better if my mom stamp her newly done nails, tapping nervously on the table. If what? Grandma's voice cut like ice. If you stole from your own son. That's when it all clicked. The sudden shopping sprees every weekend. My sister's new iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Family vacation to Cancun that I wasn't invited to. A kitchen renovation. Dad's new motorcycle sitting in our driveway. They'd stolen my graduation gift and spent it on themselves like it was Christmas morning. My sister Estania, who never worked a day in her life, was wearing earrings that cost more than my monthly gas station salary. Diamond studs that sparkled under the restaurant lights. She. I didn't even look up from her plate, too busy admiring her fresh manicure. You gave them everything their entire lives, I said quietly, my voice shaking with years of suppressed anger. And they took The one thing meant for me. The one thing I actually earned. Grandma stood up, her chair scraping against the floor loud enough to make nearby diners turn. 20 years I've watched you favor Estania over Diego like he's invisible. I sent that money specifically for him. With a letter explaining every detail of the trip I planned. My mom's face went white as paper. We never got a letter, I swear. Because you threw it away after cashing the check that had his name on it. The restaurant felt silent, despite other diners around us. Even the waiters seemed to sense the drama unfolding at our table. I couldn't hold back anymore. This explains everything. Why you suddenly had money for mom's Botox appointment and weekly spa days. Why dad bought that Harley Davidson he's been wanting for years. Why Estania got her nose job and started posting Instagram photos from five star hotels every single week. My grandmother's eyes widened with each revelation. Nose job? Instagram photos? Show me. I pulled out my phone and showed her Estania's recent posts. Bullside shots at luxury resorts in Miami. Designer shopping halls from Rodeo Drive. First class plane seats with champagne glasses. Expensive restaurant meals that cost more than I made in a week. All time stamped from the past three months. Right after my graduation, I've been working 70 hour weeks at the gas station. Just

I thought everyone had to check their mattress for cockroaches before lying down until I was 15 years old and went to someone else's house for the first time. My morning routine involved shaking out my shoes because mice nested in them overnight. I also had to brush maggots off my backpack because the smell of rotting meat from somewhere deep in the house attracted flies that laid eggs on everything. Path to the bathroom required stepping on compressed newspapers that squished with mystery liquids that had been leaking from garbage bags since 2,011. Sometimes I'd hear crunching when I accidentally stepped on the bones of one of our cats that died and got buried under trash before anyone noticed. My breakfast came from sealed packages only because I once almost ate cereal that was full of ants. A lot of the time, I had to pee in bottles because the path to the toilet got blocked by the collapsing mountain of adult diapers my mother bought in bulk. Nobody in our house needed them, but she insisted they'd be worth money during the next pan. When Parker transferred to our school and picked me to be his history partner, I tried to convince him to switch. I knew eventually he'd want to meet outside school, but he had already turned in the paper with our names and said it would be too much hassle to change it now. He kept pushing. To work at my house I finally made up this whole story about my grandmother being sick. I said that she was super contagious and had something doctors couldn't figure out. He suggested his place instead and even offered to pick me up so I wouldn't have to take a bus. I said the bus didn't run to his neighborhood, even though really I just didn't wanna trap him in a car with my smell. I've been washing my clothes in the bathroom sink at school with the pink hand soap and drying them under the hand dryer, but the smell of decomposition and ammonia had gotten into the fabric permanently. Walking into his house broke my brain because my eyes didn't know what to do with all of the empty floor space it took.

For 14 years, Debbie Salzman worked as a beloved lunch lady here at Denver Place Elementary School in Wilmington. She says she would upgrade the lunch of a child who didn't have enough money or give them extra food if they said they were still hungry. If they didn't have enough money on their account, they would get a cheese sandwich instead. Friend that got a free lunch that would come back and say, Miss Debbie, I'm still hungry. Didn't you get your belly full for supper last night? And you don't know how many times I heard they didn't have supper that night. Salesman says she kept posted note IOU's and paid out of her own pocket for kids.

I've been with Jerry for four years. When he humiliated me during our baby shower at this fancy country club he wanted to go to, my cousin asked why my pupils look so red. And I explained that this morning I threw up so hard that the blood vessels in my eyes burst. Jerry exploded on me. Shut up. Nobody wants to hear about your bloody eyes and vomit. Can you just be pregnant without making it everyone else's problem? It's revolting. The entire room went silent. His own sister tried to intervene, but he doubled down. What, I'm supposed to pretend all this isn't gross? Yesterday she described how her nipples are leaking. Last week it was about her discharge and cellulite. We get it. You're pregnant. Your body is doing nasty things. His mom gasped. Jerry, she's carrying your child. That doesn't mean I need to hear about every disgusting thing happening to her. This is supposed to be a happy day and she's making me lose my appetite. I sat down my drink. You know what, you're absolutely right. I won't discuss you with any more updates, Jerry. He looked at me surprised, then pleased. Finally. Thank you. See, not that hard to keep all that private. Two days later, Jerry found me getting dressed for my 20 week anatomy scan. What time is the appointment? I'll drive Oh, I'm going alone. I don't wanna subject you to disgusting pregnancy stuff. His face scrunched up. But we find out if it's a boy or girl today. Yeah. And that involves the technician pressing a wand covered in gel all over my stomach while we look at our baby's private parts on his screen. Plus, they measure all the organs. Pretty gross medical stuff. That's different. No, it's not. You said pregnancy details revolt you. I'm respecting that. I took an Uber and when he showed up, I made him wait outside the doctor's office. Next day, his mom called him crying tears of joy. You're having a boy. He looks perfect. And you better have already apologized to your fiance. Jerry put the phone down and stormed into the bedroom. You said the doctor said we have to wait another few weeks before gender shows. I only said that not to disgust you. I didn't want you losing your appetite. You can't keep the gender from me. I'm not keeping anything. I'm protecting you from revolting pregnancy talk, just like you asked. When people asked about baby names, I discussed them enthusiastically with everyone except Jerry. Our friends knew we were considering James. His parents knew about Thomas. His brother knew about William. Why won't you tell me the names you're considering? Discussing the baby requires mentioning pregnancy. That's off limits. Remember, this is insane. This is literally what you demanded. At 28 weeks, I, I started experiencing Concerning symptoms, my feet swelled so badly that when I pressed them, the indent stayed like memory foam and my vision kept getting black spots. I went to the hospital alone when they diagnosed me with preeclampsia and admitted me for monitoring. I texted everyone except Jerry. He found out when his brother called asking why he wasn't at the hospital. You're in the hospital and didn't tell me medical details about pregnancy or TMI. You said so yourself. You could lose the baby and you could get so grossed out by looking at me. You'd call me disgusting and the stress would definitely make me lose it. He went quiet when the doctor scheduled my C section for 36 weeks due to complications. I didn't tell Jerry. I informed his family, my family, our friends, everyone but him. The baby is coming next Tuesday, his sister told him. Jerry called me frantically. Tuesday. You're having our son on Tuesday. Yep. Didn't want to discuss you with talk about them cutting through my abdomen layers and pulling a baby out of my uterus. I need to request time off. Why? You don't want to see gross pregnancy stuff. It's literally the birth of my child.

Now you really look like your loser father. While my nieces were laughing. The next day her account was frozen and the bank for closed on her house. For three years, I've been financially supporting my younger sister Jessica to her divorce. I paid her mortgage, utilities, groceries, everything so she and her daughters wouldn't struggle. Jessica worked at a hair salon, but barely made enough. Over time, I noticed her attitude. She never said thank you, only criticized our life. If we bought a car, she'd say we were showing off. If we took Isabella on vacation, she'd complain that some of us aren't so lucky. Isabella, my daughter, has always been sweet with long, shiny brown hair. Sometimes she'd come home saying Aunt Jessica scolded me or Aunt Jessica said my dress was ugly. Those comments bothered me. Everything changed one Saturday. Isabella was invited to a friend's birthday party and wanted to look like a princess. I decided to take her to Jessica for a special haircut. I called and said, make Isabella look like a princess. I'll leave extra money. Jessica responded dryly, alright, leave her with me, but don't come too late. I dropped Isabella off at Jessica's house. Isabella was happy in her pink dress and sparkling shoes. I kissed her forehead and said I'd be back in a few hours. When I returned at five PM, I heard heartbreaking crying as I approached. I heard Jessica shouting, now you look like your father's failure. Bald and horrible, just like him! Then came laughter, Jessica's laugh and her daughter's giggles. I slammed the door open. Isabella was sitting in a chair with her head lowered. At her feet was a pile of hair, scattered like trash. When she lifted her face, my world collapsed. She was completely bald. Called Jessica had shaved her head, leaving not a single strand. My little princess had red eyes from crying, her face filled with shame. Jessica stood beside her with a razor, laughing. Her daughters were pointing at Isabella, mocking her look. She looks like an egg, Sophia said, laughing. How ugly! Added Lucia. I hugged Isabella tightly. She clung to me, shaking and threw her sobs. Said daddy, why did she do this to me? I just wanted to look pretty. What did you do to my daughter? I roared at Jessica. She stopped laughing, but didn't seem sorry. Calm down, Antonio, it was just a joke. I told her I was giving her a modern cut. She looks unique, she said with a mocking smile. A joke? You shaved my daughter's head! You humiliated her! She shrugged. Don't be dramatic, it's just hair. Plus that girl is always showing off with her long hair. Like my daughters aren't as beautiful. She's a 7 year old girl who wanted to feel pretty. You did this out of envy! Jessica exploded. Don't come at me! With envy crap. You're always showing off your perfect life while I'm struggling alone.

So on day 21, I made it permanent. 20 days of silence. That's what my wife decided I deserved after I suggested she help with household responsibilities instead of treating me like her personal butler. But here's the thing about playing the silent treatment card. Sometimes the other person decides they prefer the quiet. I finished a 12 hour shift and walked into what looked like a tornado hit our kitchen. Did. She's piled high. Take out containers scattered everywhere. And her on the couch scrolling through her phone. I made the apparently unforgivable mistake of saying, hey, think you could give me a hand cleaning up before dinner? The look she gave me could frozen hell over. Excuse me? I work, too. I'm not your maid. I never said you were. I thought we could tackle this together since we both live here. That's when she stood up, grabbed her purse, and delivered the line that would define the next three weeks. Figure it out yourself. And don't expect me to talk to you until you learn some respect. Front door slammed so hard it rattled the windows. When she came back two hours later, I thought we'd have a normal conversation. I was wrong. She walked past me like I was invisible and went straight to the bedroom. Day two rolled around and still nothing. I tried the reasonable approach. If I came across wrong yesterday, we should talk. She poured her coffee, walked past me, and left for work without acknowledging I existed. By day 5, I realized what this was. This wasn't about dishes or respect. This was control. She decided freezing me out would make me grovel and apologize for something I shouldn't apologize for. Day 7 was when something clicked. I was eating a sandwich, watching her perform her silent tantrum routine, and I started laughing. Here was a grown woman who thought giving me the cold shoulder was going to break me down. Instead, it was showing me exactly who I'd married. By day 10, the house had gotten remarkably peaceful. No arguing about whose turn it was to take out trash. No passive aggressive comments about the dishwasher. No dramatic sighs when I wanted to watch sports. I was starting to see the upside. Day 15 brought reinforcements. Her sister called asking if everything was okay because my wife seemed stressed. Told her everything was fine. I was giving my wife the space she'd requested. When her sister tried to dig deeper, I said, she knows how to end this anytime she wants an adult conversation. But here's what she didn't realize during her tantrum. I was using this time to think about what my life had become and what I wanted it to be. Day 20 arrived with her pacing around like a caged animal, looking at me with this.

You can figure it out. She shrugged. I stood there watching her walk away with her perfect little blended family, dragging their matching designer suitcases toward the gate. She didn't even look back. Not once. I had $23 in my pocket, a dead phone charge charger, and absolutely nowhere to go in this massive airport. That's when I remembered the business card tucked in my wallet. The one with the fancy logo I've been carrying around for three years. My Aunt Sarah's restaurant card. The sister my mom had been bad mouthing my entire life, calling her a jealous failure. Sarah's a pathetic loser, mom always said. She's jealous of our success and stability. Buddy, don't believe anything she tells you about our family. But standing there alone in JFK Terminal 4, watching families rush past me with their vacation excitement, I figured I had nothing left to lose. I found a payphone. Yes still exist in airports. And dialed the number with shaking fingers. It rang twice before a warm, professional voice answered. Bella Vista restaurant. This is Sarah speaking. Aunt Sarah, it's Maya. I'm. I'm in really big trouble right now. The silence lasted forever. Then, in a completely different tone. Baby girl? Maya, where are you? Are you safe? What happened? I started crying. Right there in the middle of the Busy terminal. Mom left me at the airport. She took her new husband and his kids on vacation to Hawaii and just abandoned me here. What terminal are you at? I'm coming to get you right now. You don't understand. I'm at JFK in New York. You're all the way in Chicago. I can't ask you to. Maya, Honey, listen to me carefully. I have three successful restaurants now. I'm not the broke failure your mother told you I was. Exactly where you are. I'm getting on the next available flight. Four hours later, I watched a confident woman in designer jeans and a cashmere coat rush through the arrivals gate, scanning the crowd frantically. She looked exactly like mom, but her eyes were kind instead of cold. When she spotted me, she started running. I've been waiting 10 years for the phone call, she whispered, hugging me so tight I could barely breathe. I've tried reaching you so many times, but your mother blocked every single attempt. To ride to her luxury hotel suite was completely surreal. Sarah explained everything while ordering room service. How she built a successful restaurant empire from nothing. How she been sending birthday cards and Christmas gifts that mom apparently threw away unopened. How she'd even hired a family lawyer once to try for visitation rights. Your mother told everyone in our family

I didn't argue. I just closed our joint accounts and changed the locks instead. Last Tuesday, I received divorce papers from my wife, Natalia, after four years of marriage. But she didn't deliver them herself. Her new boyfriend, Gabriel, showed up at my doorstep with the envelope. Natalia wants you out by Friday, he told me with arrogant, confident. Find somewhere else to stay. I looked at this guy, who'd clearly been sleeping with my wife, and simply replied, okay. He probably expected me to break down or punch him. Instead, I closed the door and started making calls. First to my lawyer, then to the bank. What? Gabriel and Natalia didn't know the house was solely in my name. I bought it before we married with inheritance money and never added her to the title. Gabriel had been living there for a month while I was away for work. Natalia claimed he was an acquaintance going through tough time. Complete lie. When he demanded I find somewhere else to stay. He was trying to kick me out of my own house. By Wednesday morning, I changed all the locks. That afternoon, I canceled Gabriel's access to everything. Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Prime. He'd even added himself to my 90 Dollar Family Gym membership. Canceled that too. Thursday night, Gabriel appeared, banging on the door. What the hell is going on? Why did you change the locks? Cause this is my house. I Replied from inside, Natalia can get her things, but you have to leave. She's my partner. Now we're together. Perfect. Go be together somewhere else. His tantrum was epic, screaming that I was vengeful that he had rights. Meanwhile, I recorded everything. I texted Natalia, you have 48 hours to collect your belonging. Gabriel is not welcome here. Her response you can't do this. Gabriel lives here now. Check the property title. He's nowhere on it. The next morning, Gabriel's lawyer showed up, claiming Gabriel had tendency rights because as he'd lived there over 30 days. I showed him the recording of Gabriel screaming that he was there as my wife's partner, not a tenant. There's no lease, no rent payments, no contributions, I explained, showing the property title with me as sole owner. The lawyer went pale and left quickly.

Twitch chatter. Sarah came home from her 12 hour hospital shift to find me in the same spot at my computer. Twitch stream on one monitor, spreadsheets minimized on the other. She dropped her bag with that familiar exhausted sound. Mike, eight months. You've been unemployed for eight months watching gamers play Fortnite? My mom keeps asking if you're depressed. I quickly switched tabs as she approached. Just keeping myself busy. Busy? You're watching someone build a virtual house. She saw my chat messages and actively participating. This isn't a hobby anymore. It's an addiction. What she didn't see were the other tabs supplier emails from China, Shipping trackers, customer service responses. The Twitch streams were just background noise while I managed orders, adjusted Facebook ad campaigns, and negotiated with suppliers about delayed shipments. My sister's husband just bought a rental property, Sarah continued. Meanwhile, I'm telling people you're between opportunities. Truth was, my dropshipping business was finally profitable after 6 months of testing products. Gaming accessories of all things. Mouse pads with LED edges, custom keyboard caps, able management systems. Stuff I found by watching what streamers complained about. Can you at least come to dinner tomorrow? Pretend you're trying. Her family dinner was torture. Her brother described his new BMW. Her father offered me a pity job at his hardware store. Again, Sarah deflected questions about our future, saying we were figuring things out. Maybe he could drive For Uber, her mother suggested. Loud enough for me to hear. Everything unraveled because the doorbell camera notification. Sarah was showing her sister our ring footage to prove our neighbor's dog kept getting in our yard. She scrolled too far back and saw something odd. Delivery drivers. Dozens of them. Every single day. Mike, why are so many packages coming to our house? Her sister leaned in. Are you shopping addicts? Is that why you're broke? Their returns, I said quickly. But Sarah kept scrolling. The packages were being picked up, not dropped off. Different drivers collecting them. What the hell is this? I couldn't hide it anymore. Opened my laptop and showed her the Shopify dashboard. 300 orders this month. Inventory spreadsheet showing zero stock because everything shipped directly from suppliers to customers. You're selling things? Gaming accessories. Mouse pads, mostly. She stared at the revenue numbers. Last month was my best yet. Enough to cover our mortgage twice. But you don't have any products here. They ship from the supplier. I handle marketing and customer service. I showed her the Facebook ads running in the background, the email campaigns, the abandoned cart sequences. This. This is real money. I opened the business checking account. Six months of deposits from Shopify. Not fortune, but solid middle class income from selling LED mouse pads to gamers. Why didn't you tell me? Remember when I tried explaining dropshipping? You said it was a pyramid scheme for people who watch too many YouTube gurus because you explained it while watching someone play Minecraft at 2:00am, her sister was reading over her shoulder. Wait, he's been running a business this whole time? Sarah scrolled through customer emails, reviews, the business registration, tax documents, everything legit, just invisible. I've been telling everyone you're unemployed. I cried to my therapist about supporting you. I know my dad offered you minimum wage out of pity. I make more than his offer in three days selling mouse pads. Her phone started buzzing, family group chat exploding as her sister shared the news. Her dad asking how online selling actually worked. Her mom confused about what dropshipping meant. Why all the secrecy, though? It wasn't supposed to be secret. But every time I tried explaining, you'd see me on the computer and assume I was wasting time. Eventually, I stopped trying.

Penny cornered me at lunch Monday, Monica and Christina flanking her like bodyguards. Jenna, this is an intervention, she announced. Monica snorted. You text me literally every five minutes. You waited outside my math class yesterday, even though yours is across campus. You got weird when I went to Monica's sleepover without you. She crossed her arms. It's honestly embarrassing. Monica's best friend has her own life, her own friends. They're independent. You're, like, obsessed with me or something. Christina laughed. No offense, but it's giving desperate. Penny shrugged. You need to get your own life and stop making me her entire personality. I felt my face burn, but looking at Penny's expression, I realized she was serious. Had I really been that bad? After my parents divorced, penny was my rock. Maybe I'd held on too tight. Maybe I depended on her too much emotionally. I'm sorry, I said quietly. I didn't realize I was making you uncomfortable. Starting Tuesday, I gave her exactly what she asked for. No morning texts. Said they were too much. I saw her in the hallway and just smiled instead of running over. She wanted space. At lunch, I accepted the Art Girls invitation to sit with them. They've been asking for weeks, and I'd always said no to stay with penny. They were genuinely excited to have me. Finally, Lorelai said, We've been wanting to be friends forever. But you were always with penny. They were so welcoming, teaching me their inside jokes, including me in their group chat. Thursday morning hurt the most. We bought tickets together weeks ago for the school's talent show. Front row seats to support our friends band. I sat there alone, saving her seat with my backpack until the lights dimmed. She never came. During intermission, I saw her Instagram story. She was at Starbucks with Monica and Christina, laughing over Frappuccinos. The caption read, so much better than boring school events. My eyes burned with tears. I wouldn't let fall. She'd known and didn't show up. And worse, she seemed happier without me. I deleted the text I'd started typing, asking where she was. She wanted space, and clearly she was thriving with it. After the show, I joined the drama club, something penny had always made fun of. When Romeo from drama asked if I wanted to practice lines after school, I said yes. Immediately. I posted a selfie with him captioned new drama partner with heart emojis. Penny viewed it in 10 seconds, but didn't like it. Lorelai invited me to a party Friday. Penny will be there, too, she mentioned. At the party, I stayed with my new friends, but kept checking on penny discreetly. She was with Monica and Christina by the pool. When Monica loudly said, at least you finally got rid of your stalker. I pretend ended not To hear penny laughed along with them, that stung. But if that's how she felt, I'd respect it. Everything crashed down Tuesday. I was heading to art club when I heard someone crying in the bathroom. Harsh, painful sobs. My heart knew it was penny before my brain did. Soph, are you okay? I asked softly through the door. Leave me alone, Jenna. I don't want to guilt you into caring about my problems. What? Penny, please let me in. The door unlocked. I look destroyed. Mascara streaking, eyes swollen. My parents are getting divorced, she whispered. Dad's been cheating for months. I found out Sunday night. My heart broke. I pulled her into my arms, feeling her whole body shake. She told me through gasps how she'd wanted to call me Sunday night when her dad moved out, but Monica had convinced her not to be a hypocrite. How she'd seen my Instagram.

A week long road trip with no electronics? They might as well have suggested we travel by covered wagon. But what if there's an emergency? Denki asked, already plotting. We'll have our phones for emergencies only, mom said. But they'll be locked in the glove compartment. The night before we left, Denki and I held an emergency sibling meeting. We were not going down without a fight. Operation Digital Rebellion is a go! She whispered, pulling out a duffel bag full of contraband electronics. We spent hours hiding devices throughout our luggage. Denki sown a secret pocket into her pillow for her phone. I hollered out a thick book and stuffed my Nintendo Switch inside. We even hit a portable charger inside a bag of trail mix. Day one started with Dad's enthusiastic announcement. Isn't this great, kids? Look at all this beautiful scenery. Let's play the license plate game. Wow, dad, A Nebraska plate! Riveting. Denki deadpanned while secretly texting her boyfriend through her pillow. By hour three, mom was getting suspicious because we were being unusually cooperative. About her car games. Little did she know, I was playing Pokemon under a blanket while pretending to nap. You kids seem awfully quiet back there, she said, turning around. Just enjoying the family bonding, mom, I said, quickly shoving my switch under my fake book. Denki had gotten creative with her rebellion. She downloaded audiobooks and was listening through earbuds she threaded through her hoodie strings. Every time mom asked her a question, she pretend to be deep in thought about nature. By day two, we'd established an elaborate system. Denki would be the lookout while I game, then we'd switch. We communicated through coughs and sneezes. That meant parents incoming or coast is clear. The funniest part was when dad stopped at this scenic overlook and insisted we all take a family photo. While he was setting up his camera, Denki was frantically trying to finish a level on her hidden phone game. Denki, Smile! Dad called out, just a second. I'm appreciating the natural beauty, she said, thumbs flying across her screen. Our rebellion reached peak chaos on day three when we discovered the hotel had terrible Wi-Fi. Denki had a complete meltdown because she couldn't upload her secret vacation selfies to Instagram. The bathroom has better no! She whispered to me during dinner. So there we were, taking turns hiding in the hotel bathroom, desperately trying to get one bar of service while our parents thought we had digestive issues from the road trip snacks. You Kids have been spending a lot of time in the bathroom, mom observed suspiciously. Must be all that healthy trail mix you packed, I said innocently, while Denki was literally sitting on the bathroom floor trying to connect to Wi-Fi. Day 4 brought disaster. Dad decided to surprise us with a spontaneous hike and grabbed our backpacks to carry water bottles. That's when he discovered Denki's secret phone charging station she'd set up using the car's USB port. What is this?

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We'd known each other since freshman year. And when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything, 50 50, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird serious face she starts with. So I've been thinking and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. But she's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue because honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I tell her, fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realize I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says, okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the TV and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realised she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that really made me laugh. When I was packing up the kitchen stuff, I realised I'd bought all the cooking supplies too, the pans, the good knife set, even the can opener. I left her with basically nothing except a mini fridge and some random cups she had from high school. By the time I finished loading everything, the apartment looked like nobody had ever lived there, just empty rooms with some random junk scattered around that wasn't worth taking. I drive to my new place. Feeling pretty good about myself. I'm unpacking when my phone starts blowing up. First it's texts, then calls. Megan is absolutely losing it. What the hell did you do to the apartment? She screams. When I finally pick up, it's completely empty. I tell her calmly that I took everything I paid for, just like I said I would. She she starts yelling about how she looks like an idiot because her friends were supposed to come over that night and now there's nowhere to sit and nothing to watch. You can't just take everything, she says. How am I supposed to explain this? I remind her that she literally said okay when I told her I was taking my stuff. She hangs up on me.

Now my, he wants my house. When I was 16, my gaming obsessed brother Tyler convinced my parents I was taking up too much space in our cramped three bedroom apartment. He'd been complaining for months that he needed my room for his elaborate gaming setup. My parents sat me down one evening and basically said I had two weeks to find alternative living arrangements. The reasoning, I was almost 17, practically an adult and Tyler needed space to pursue his passion in gaming and they genuinely believed he was going to become the next big twitch star. I was devastated but had nowhere to go. My girlfriend Emma's parents noticed I'd been spending more time at their house and eventually asked what was going on. When I explained the situation, her mom immediately said I could stay stay with them as long as I needed, no questions asked. Emma and I got serious fast. Living under the same roof will do that to a relationship. When we turned 19, I proposed with a ring. I'd saved six months for working overtime every weekend. Parents were thrilled. They basically raised me for two years anyway and considered me their son. At 23, we finally had enough saved for a down payment on a small two bedroom house, nothing fancy. We spent every weekend renovating, learning YouTube tutorials, making mistakes and fixing them. Meanwhile, Tyler was still living with my parents in his gaming paradise. He Dropped out of community college after one semester, claiming his streaming career was about to take off. College was just holding him back. Three years later, he was still grinding away at maybe five viewers on a good day, sleeping until two PM, gaming until 4:00am, ordering Doordash with my parents money. My parents occasionally texted generic holiday messages or shared Facebook posts about family, but otherwise, we had zero relationship. Last month, my mom showed up at my house completely unannounced. I hadn't seen her.

I'm 27 years old and my boyfriend Jake is 33. We've been together for almost two years now, and honestly, marriage is probably in our future, but we're not rushing it. Here's the thing, though. My mom still treats me like I'm some teenager sneaking around behind her back whenever we visit my parents. She makes this huge deal about us not sleeping in the same bed, like we're gonna corrupt her precious house or something. We're adults who live together and pay our own, but apparently that doesn't matter to her. She acts like we're gonna start making out at the dinner table if we share a room. This past summer, Jake suggested we just get a hotel room so we could actually be comfortable and not deal with her weird rules. You would have thought we told her we were starting a meth lab in her basement. She went completely insane about it, kept going on and on about how disrespectful we were and how we embarrassed her in front of the neighbors because someone might see us going to the hotel together. She literally made me promise not to do that again like I was 8 years old asking for permission to have a sleepover. I felt so stupid agreeing to it, but I didn't want the drama.

I was feeling pretty good from the vacation drinks the night before because I decided to respond. I told them it was ridiculous that they expected me to follow teenager rules in my late 20s and that I technically kept my promise since I wasn't staying at any hotel during our visit to them.

Some of their friends, Started commenting, asking why they were trying to control their adult daughter's sleeping arrangements. Others were saying stuff like maybe there's a reason she didn't want to come home. My family looked pretty stupid, honestly. They deleted the post pretty quick after that, but the damage was done.

My parents were so worried about me dating a skater boy, they couldn't imagine he'd be the reason I'm still alive today. A few nights ago, my parents found out about my skater boyfriend, reggis, when his message popped up on my screen at dinner. I love you, too. Who the heck are you talking to? My mom shouted, glaring at the screen of my phone. You're 14. No dating until you're 30. We were very clear. Dad pulled up Reggis's Instagram on his own phone. Escape border? Really? This is who you're risking your future for? I tried to reason with them, but they refused to listen and forced me to block him everywhere, right there, over dinner. You'll thank us when you're in college, mom said while I sobbed. My friends tried passing messages between us at school, but my parents found out and threatened to call their parents. Eventually, everyone gave up, except for Greggus. Greggus showed up mysteriously in my valorant lobby. Hey, Mel. It's been a while, he said, his voice breaking. I miss you, Mel. I know we're not supposed to talk, but let's at least play like we used to. We started meeting in the lobbies every day after that, just playing and chatting about normal things. School friends, my strict parents. He never once tried to convince me to sneak around or meet up in person. He never complained. About my parents or tried to turn me against them. When I vent about how unfair they were being, he'd actually defend them. Sometimes they're just scared, Once my older sister got mixed up with some bad people in high school. Parents get paranoid. He still cared about me in all the ways that mattered. When I failed my chemistry test because I couldn't focus, he spent three hours teaching me balancing equations over discord. When my grandmother got sick, he stayed up until 3:00am just listening to me cry. You can always reach me here, he promised. I don't care what time it is. Mom almost got us once when she walked by while discord was open. I clicked to my game lobby just in time. Homework break? She asked. I nodded and switched back to my essay, my heart pounding so hard I thought she'd hear it after she left Greg's message. Maybe we should stop. I don't want to get you in trouble, but I couldn't lose him again. He was the only person who I could rely on. And thank god I didn't lose him, because a couple of days later, my friend Sarah and I got caught up in some shady business. It was supposed to be a normal Saturday night sleepover. Her parents went out for their anniversary, leaving us to watch movies and eat junk food. I was on the phone messaging Gregus on discord when Sarah's older brother Joshua came. Home from college, completely wasted with two other friends, Sarah immediately tensed up. baby sis and baby girl. He winked disgustingly. He and his friends sat beside us on the sofa, placing his arm over my shoulder, constantly whispering things like, I know you're not as innocent as you act, and your parents don't have to know. I pushed his face away and stood up, glaring. Can you stop? Sarah was almost crying, begging me not to make him mad. He gets mean when he's drunk. She was, just ignore him and he'll pass out soon. But when Joshua grabbed my waist and tried to pull me onto his lap, I grabbed Sarah's arm and ran to the bathroom. Quickly locking the door, he started pounding on it, laughing with his friends about how I was playing hard to get and needed to loosen up. Sarah hopped into the tub, hugging her knees to her chest. I patted my pockets, realizing I had left my phone in the living room. Soon the knocks on the door became angrier. Hitting the door harder, jiggling the handle aggressively, Sarah meekly handed me her phone.

Brian thought college was a four year party with a diploma handed out at the end. I was just a nerdy roommate who'd somehow help him pass his classes. We weren't paired by choice. Housing lottery put us together freshman year. The football player and the scholarship kid. From day one, he made it clear what he thought of me. Seriously? You're studying on a Friday night? He'd laugh. This is college, man. You're supposed to be making memories. His memories involved coming back at 3:00am, stumbling into my desk, and. And occasionally vomiting near my backpack. Things shifted in October when he realized he was failing economics. The coach had warned him, maintain a 2.5 GPA or get benched. Hey, you're good at this stuff, right? He dropped his textbook on my keyboard. I need help. I agreed to tutor him, explain supply and demand curves created practice problems. He nodded along, then asked, so can you just write my paper for me? I've got a game this weekend. I refused, offered to review his draft instead. He laughed like I. I told a joke. Come on, nobody will know. I'll pay you. I can't do that, I said. It's academic dishonesty. We could both get expelled. His smile faded. Whatever, man. Thought you were cool. After that, our fragile roommate peace collapsed. He'd invite friends over when I had exams. Accidentally Spill drinks on my notes, hide my alarm clock. Before important classes, I started spending more time at the library, coming back only to sleep. I was working two part time jobs alongside a full course load. Midterms came. Brian failed economic specta. Got benched for two games. One morning, I woke up to find him staring at me, eyes bloodshot. You could have helped me, he said. Now coach says I might lose my scholarship. I tried to help. I replied, you wanted me to do it for you. Then came the real breaking point. I saved for two years to buy my first car. A used Honda with 120,000 miles. Nothing fancy, but it meant I could live off campus next year. The morning after Brian received his final warning from the athletics department, I found my car with all four tires slashed. Loser scratched into the door. Windshield crack. Campus security said they couldn't.

Mom's eating breakfast, scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading Life 3, 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work part time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest, she says. If we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear, which sounds like something a dictator would say. But whatever. She makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realize immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3, 60 doesn't just show where you are, it shows your speed when driving, your phone battery, and sends notifications for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect. Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says, no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she's shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is, men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realize she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom checked your location while I'm at school, dad text she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realize she's literally sitting there refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day 3, mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 in a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses a client worth $2,000. Week 2, she sees I stopped at McDonald's for three minutes and lectures me about wasting money, which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for four hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and ask her four hours at one store and mom glares at me like I should have warned her he was checking but how can I when she's watching my every move? She used to Text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until eleven PM Dad mentions, that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough, but I've been to that clinic. They close at 6 that night. Dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits, and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives marked final Notice, and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that. And mom says, processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location pins on the map. Week 5 and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the Medical Plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11:00am and it's now six PM I tell my manager I'm sick and drive over. Dad's already there in the parking lot looking at life. 3, 60, zoom.

This dude looked like he hadn't showered in weeks and had those dead eyes that scream trouble. Then my tools started disappearing from the garage. I went out there one day to grab my drill, and half my toolbox was gone. I checked my security camera, and there's Leah, her boyfriend, and Erica loading up my stuff into their car. When I asked Erica about it, she's like, oh, they're just borrowing them. They'll bring them back. Borrowing without asking? I had to Text and call multiple times over three weeks to get my own tools back. When they finally returned them, half were dirty and my socket wrench was missing a piece. But the real kicker happened on a Friday night. I was working late in my home office when I heard bottles clinking together from the kitchen. Erica wasn't even home, so I went to check what was going on. There's Leah behind my bar, going through my wine collection like she owns the place. I asked what the hell she was doing, and she goes, Erica said I could borrow a bottle for my party tonight. I'll pay you back. I told her absolutely not and to get out. When I confronted Erica later, she gives me this vague I don't remember telling her that, but maybe I did. Bullshit response. I sat her down and told her I wasn't comfortable with Leah having free access to my house anymore. Erica sort of nodded along, but I could tell she thought I was overreacting. The final straw came three weeks later. I wanted to hit the driving range after work, so I went to grab my golf clubs from the garage. They were gone. These weren't some cheap set, either. I'd saved up for months to buy them, and golf was basically my only hobby. I'm freaking out, checking everywhere when I remember the camera. Sure enough, there's Leah using the garage code to waltz in and take my clubs. While we weren't home, I completely lost it and called Erica immediately. Get my clubs back right now, or I'm calling the police, I told her. Erica's like, what? Leah just asked for the garage code to grab some clothes from her closet. She took my golf clubs. Erica, check the camera yourself. When Erica confronted Leah, she came up with some story about how her boyfriend needed them for a work thing. Work thing? What job requires stolen golf clubs? They kept my clubs for four days, and when I finally got them back, they were covered in dirt and one of the grips was torn. That night, I sat Erica down for the most serious conversation of our relationship.

I'm 27 years old, and my boyfriend Jake is 33. We've been together for almost two years now, and honestly, marriage is probably in our future, but we're not rushing it. Here's the thing, though. My mom still treats me like I'm some teenager sneaking around behind her back. Whenever we visit my parents, she makes this huge deal about us not sleeping in the same bed, like we're gonna corrupt her precious house or something. We're adults who live together and pay our own bills, but apparently that doesn't matter to her. She acts like we're gonna start making out at the dinner table if we share a room. This past summer, Jake suggested we just get a hotel room so we could actually be comfortable and not deal with her weird rules. You would have thought. We told her we were starting a meth lab in her basement. She went completely insane about it. Kept going on and on about how disrespectful we were and how we embarrassed her in front of the neighbors because someone might see us going to the hotel together. She literally made me promise not to do that again. Like I was 8 years old, asking for permission to have a sleepover. I felt so stupid agreeing to it, but I didn't want the drama. So when Christmas planning came around, Jake's parents invited us to visit them in Mexico. They retired there a few years ago, and they're super chill people. We decided to go because, honestly, it sounded amazing. Beach weather in December while everyone back home is freezing their asses off? Yes, please. But here's where I got a little sneaky. We didn't tell my parents we weren't coming home for Christmas. When my mom asked me at Thanksgiving if I was gonna keep my promise about not getting a hotel, I told her the truth, that I wouldn't be staying at any hotel when we visited them. Which was technically true since we weren't visiting them at all. So there I was, sitting on this gorgeous balcony overlooking the Caribbean, drinking coffee and watching the sunrise, when I made the mistake of checking Facebook. My mom and sisters had posted all this passive aggressive stuff about how hurt they were that I lied to them and how selfish I was for abandoning the family on Christmas. I guess I was feeling pretty good from the vacation drinks the night before, because I decided to respond. I told them it was ridiculous that they expected me to follow teenager rules in my late 20s, and that I technically kept my promise since I wasn't staying at any hotel during our visit to them. Then I said if they were gonna air our family business on Facebook for everyone to see, I just avoid visits altogether from now on. Well, that got people talking. Some of their Friends started commenting asking why they were trying to control their adult daughter's sleeping arrangements. Others were saying stuff like maybe there's a reason she didn't want to come home. My family looked pretty stupid, honestly. They deleted the post pretty quick after that, but the damage was done.

My sister called me a bad mom until her kid told me the truth. When Emma asked if she could dye her hair blue for her 13th birthday, I said, sure. It's just hair, right? She'd been begging me for weeks, showing me Pinterest photos of these gorgeous ocean blue highlights. At target. We picked out some semi permanent dye that would wash out in a month. She was so excited, she could barely sit still while I painted the streaks in our tiny bathroom. The next morning at breakfast, she kept flipping her hair and grinning at herself in the toaster reflection. I made her favorite blueberry pancakes, and she kept saying how the blue and her hair match the berries perfectly. Was honestly the happiest I'd seen her since her dad moved out last year. But when we showed up at my sister Beth's house for Sunday dinner, everything went sideways fast. Beth took one look at Emma, and her face just dropped. He pulled me into the kitchen while Emma was playing with her cousins and started going off about how irresponsible I was being. What kind of message does this send? She whispered harshly, gesturing toward the living room. She's going to look like some delinquent at school. I tried explaining it was just temporary hair dye, that Emma was still getting straight A's and playing violin, but Beth wouldn't hear it. She kept shaking her head and Muttering about how I was clearly struggling as a single mom and needed to set better boundaries. The whole dinner was awkward after that, with Beth making passive aggressive comments about certain parent choices every time Emma's hair caught the light. When we got home that night, Emma seemed deflated. She kept touching her hair and asking if I thought it looked stupid. I reassured her it looked amazing, but I could tell Beth's reaction had gotten to her. That's when I decided to call my mom to vent about the whole thing. Mom listened patiently while I ranted about Beth being judgmental. Then she got quiet for a moment. Honey, she said carefully, there's something you should probably know about your sister's situation. Apparently, Beth had been calling mom almost daily, crying about her twelve year old son, Tyler. He'd been getting into fights at school, his grades were dropping, and she'd found vape cartridges hidden in his backpack twice in the past month. The school counselor had suggested family therapy. Beth refused because she didn't want anyone thinking she couldn't handle her own kid. Mom said Beth was probably projecting her own guilt and frustration onto me because my problem was just blue hair, while her actual problem was much more serious. Next weekend, Tyler showed up at our door around dinner time looking miserable. Emma invited him to stay for tacos, and while we were eating, he started opening up. Turns out he'd been hanging with older Kids who were getting him into trouble, but he was too scared to tell his mom because she'd been so stressed lately. He said he wished his parents would let him express himself like Emma could, instead of just yelling at him for everything. After Tyler went home, Emma hugged me tight and said, thanks for letting me be myself, mom, even when Aunt Beth was being mean about it. That's when I realized the blue hair wasn't just about looking cool. It was about Emma feeling safe enough to explore who she was becoming, knowing I'd support her no matter what.

My older sister is super jumpy. Like she gets scared if the toast pops up too loud. So when I found out she'd been watching creepy sleepwalking videos all week, I saw my golden opportunity. One night I stayed up late and waited until I knew she was asleep. Then I slowly opened her bedroom door, walked in barefoot with my eyes half closed and started mumbling random garbage like the bees are listening. They can smell light. She's screamed full panic. I pretended to snap out of it like I didn't know what was going on. And the next morning I told her I had no memory of it. That's what really got her. She was convinced I was actually sleepwalking. So I did it again the next night. This time I stood at the end of her bed holding a spoon and just went spread, I am the serial. I was holding myself from bursting out laughing. After that, she started locking her door. So I got creative. I'd rattle the doorknob or just whisper her name through the air vent until she freaked out. I kept telling her I didn't remember any of it. My acting was elite. She even started filming me to prove it was real. But I would just delete the videos when she wasn't looking. It became this little war. Honestly, it was the most fun I'd had in weeks. I never Meant to actually scare her, just mess with her a little. But then one night she ran into my room looking pale and said, I need to show you something right now. I followed her down the hall thinking it was just another one of her overreactions. she opened her phone and pulled up a video from the night before. The footage showed her room in the dark and a figure slowly pushing the door open. Me or someone that looked like me. I watched the figure step into her room, stand completely still for a full minute, then start whispering. But it wasn't gibberish this time. It was my name. Over and over, whispered slowly, almost like then it tilted its head and said, I know you're awake. That's when the video cut out. I tried to laugh it off and said, okay, I admit it, that one was actually kind of good. But she didn't laugh. She looked at me and said, that wasn't from last night. That was from the night you slept over at Sam's house. My stomach dropped. I'd spent that night two neighborhoods over crashing on my friend's couch. I pulled out my own phone to double check the text. There it was, a message from me at 11:08 saying, crashing here tonight. Tell mom that video was recorded at 203:00am. I stared at the screen and tried to find some logical explanation. Maybe someone was messing with us. Maybe she faked The whole thing. But then she said, I didn't want to tell you, but a few nights ago I saw you standing in the hallway. I called your name and you didn't answer. You just walked into the bathroom and never came out. When I checked a minute later, the light was off and the room was empty. That was the part I couldn't explain because I remembered.

My parents discovered I wasn't their biological child when I was 16, not through some dramatic DNA test, through my little sister's science project. She was doing genetics homework, mapping out eye colours and couldn't make our family tree work. Brown eyes plus brown eyes can't make blue eyes, she, he said, pointing at me. Mom went white. Dad started stuttering about recessive genes. That night I heard them screaming through the walls. Mom admitted she had an affair 17 years ago. Dad wasn't my father. The man who raised me, taught me to ride a bike, helped with homework for 16 years, suddenly looked at me like I was a stranger. The change was immediate and brutal. Dad stopped coming to my baseball games. When I try talking to him, he'd respond with one word answers or just leave the room. Mom kept insisting nothing had changed, but he'd flinch whenever dad was cold to me. Then came the comparisons. Every family dinner became a catalog of how my sister and I were different. Look how naturally athletic Sophie is, dad would say, watching her throw a ball. She gets that from me. The implication hung in the air like poison. They started treating me like a house guest. My curfew got earlier while my sister stayed the same. My allowance got cut because money is tight. But Sophie got new clothes whenever she asked. When I brought it up, mom said, I Was being dramatic. The worst part was watching them rewrite history. Photos of me got moved to the back of albums. My baby pictures disappeared from the mantle. Dad started telling stories about Sophie's milestones while pretending mine never happened. It was like they were erasing 16 years. My breaking point came during Christmas. Extended family was over and Uncle Mike asked about my college plans. Dad said, well, he's not really academic like Sophie. Different genetics, you know, he said genetics like it was a dirty word. That's when it clicked. Didn't just learn I wasn't blood related. They decided I wasn't family. So I made a choice that destroyed them. I found my biological father. His name was John Sins. He lived three states away, had no idea I existed. When I called him, he cried, actually cried. Said he'd wondered about my mom for years, hoped she was happy. Two weeks later, John drove 400 miles to meet me. He brought photo albums of his family, told me about my half brother who played baseball like me, showed me pictures of my real grandmother who had died the year before. But here's what broke my parents. John didn't just accept me, he celebrated me. Within a month, he'd driven back twice more. He came to my games, met my friends, me car shopping for my 17th birthday. My parents watched this man give me everything they taken away. Dad became obsessed, calling John a stranger, trying to Steal his son. Mom begged me to stop seeing him, said it was destroying our family. I told them they'd already destroyed it. The night they decided biology mattered more than 16 years of love. The final blow came at graduation. Both my family showed up. John sat in the front road.

My sister died when my niece Chloe was 12 and her dad basically disappeared after that. So Chloe moved in with me and my husband. He was this quiet kid who barely talked for the first year, which honestly broke my heart because my sister was the loudest person alive. By the time Chloe turned 15, she started opening up more. She tell me about school, drama, boys she thought were cute, normal teenage stuff. But then junior year, she started acting different. She get weird when her friends talked about guys and she stopped mentioning crushes all together. I figured she was just focusing on school. One night she was helping me make dinner when she goes, Aunt Jamie, what would you do if someone in our family was gay? I'm stirring pasta sauce trying to act casual and I said something like, love them the exact same way I always have. She got quiet after that. A few weeks later, she brought home this girl named Alex for a study session, except they weren't studying anything. They were sitting way too close on the couch sharing earbuds and Chloe was laughing more than I'd seen in years. When Alex left, Chloe had this dopey smile that gave everything away. I didn't say anything because I wanted her to tell me when she was ready. But then my mom called last month asking if Chloe Was dating anyone. My mom's old school Catholic, the type who still thinks being gay is a choice and that prayer can fix everything. She started going on about how she couldn't wait for Chloe to find a nice boy and settle down. That's when I realized the problem. See, my sister left Chloe a pretty big inheritance that she gets when she turns 18. But there's a catch. My mom controls it until then. And knowing my mom, if she found out Chloe was gay, she'd probably find some way to mess with that money or make Chloe's life hell. So when Chloe finally came out to me last week, I was in my kitchen at midnight, scared I'd kick her out. I hugged her tight and told her I was proud of her. But then I said, listen, you need to keep this between us for now. Your grandma can't know until you get your inheritance. She looked confused. So I explained the whole situation, how grandma still thinks gay people are going to hell, how she controls the money, how we only have to wait six more months until Chloe turns 18. Chloe got upset and said she was tired of hiding who she was. I, I told her I wasn't asking her to hide forever, just to be smart about it. Bring Alex over whenever you want, I said. Be yourselves here, but around grandma maybe. Don't mention the girlfriend part yet. She called me a Coward and locked herself in her room for two days. My husband thinks I'm wrong, too, says we shouldn't let my mom's bigotry control our choices. I've seen how nasty my mom can get when she disapproves of something. She cut off my cousin for getting pregnant at 19 and didn't speak to him for three years. Six months feels like forever when you're 17 and in love. But that inheritance could pay for Chloe's college, maybe help her buy a house someday. It's her mom's money, money my sister saved specifically for Chloe's future.

My mom's old school Catholic, the type who still thinks being gay is a choice and that prayer can fix everything. She started going on about how she couldn't wait for Chloe to find a nice boy and settle down. That's when I realized the problem. See, my sister left Chloe a pretty big inheritance that she gets when she turns 18. But there's a catch. My mom controls it until then. And knowing my mom, if she found out Chloe was gay, she'd probably find some way to mess with that money or make Chloe's life hell. So when Chloe finally came out to me last week, I was in my kitchen at midnight, scared I'd kick her out. I hugged her tight and told her I was proud of her. But then I said, listen, you need to keep this between us for now. Your grandma can't know until you get your inheritance. She looked confused. So I explained the whole situation, how grandma still thinks gay people are going to hell, how she controls the money, how we only have to wait six more months until Chloe turns 18. Chloe got upset and said she was tired of hiding who she was. I, I told her I wasn't asking her to hide forever, just to be smart about it. Bring Alex over whenever you want, I said. Be yourselves here, but around grandma maybe. Don't mention the girlfriend part yet. She called me a Coward and locked herself in her room for two days. My husband thinks I'm wrong, too, says we shouldn't let my mom's bigotry control our choices. I've seen how nasty my mom can get when she disapproves of something. She cut off my cousin for getting pregnant at 19 and didn't speak to him for three years. Six months feels like forever when you're 17 and in love. But that inheritance could pay for Chloe's college, maybe help her buy a house someday. It's her mom's money, money my sister saved specifically for Chloe's future.

The only reason he even volunteered for the camping trip was to co chaperone with the beautiful Ms. Dizon. But of course, don't let his wife know, right? So while he was there trying to impress her with his wilderness expertise, a baby bear cub wandered into our campsite, sniffing around me and the other students. He stumbled back and pointed at it. Mister V, there's a bear! He yelled in a high pitched voice. Mister IV looked over and laughed at our worried expression. Are you seriously scared of a little moving build? A bear? It's smaller than my Labrador. He walked over and picked up the cub on the back of its neck and held it up like a stop animal, winking at Miss I Dizon. See? You kids need to toughen up when we get back to school. 10 laps, all of you! He laughed as the cub cried and squealed before kicking it into the bushes. There, done. Now everyone go to bed. When we tried to say something, he cut us off. Anyone who disrupts adult conversation gets detention for a week. He turned to Miss Dizon, who was sitting by the fire. These city kids are so dramatic. Wanna check out the stars by the lake? Better view away from all these tents. Giggled and stood up. Lead the way. When they were gone, all of us looked at each other. With wide eyes, we all knew something bad was going to happen. I hate to be the bringer of bad news, Daphne said, cutting through the tension, but didn't our biology teacher warn us that a baby bear always mean the mother is nearby? Another kid with glasses nodded. My uncle survived a bear attack and told us never to mess with a cub. So what should we do? While we all stood there trying to figure out what to do, the smart kid Alex, started moving all our food and coolers to an empty tent opposite from where we were sleeping. Are you guys gonna help or what? We practically sprang into action, carrying all our snacks into the same tent, filling it up like we were making an offering to some local deity. Mr. V snuck up on us and yelled, what are you doing with all the food? Alex tried to explain, but Mr. V cut him off. I've had enough of this bear talk from you guys! One more word and I swear you'll be hearing from the principal. Just as he marched off, we heard the baby cubs cries suddenly returned, like it was getting closer to the camp again. Two girls who had been away ran towards our group, completely out of breath. We just went through the creepiest thing. We heard heavy breathing, branches breaking, and I swear something was looking at me from the trees. I followed them to where they were. And found huge tracks and claw marks on trees. My heart suddenly raced. We gotta go! We sprinted back with the rest of the group and made a quick plan. You two grab the keys to the cars and buses. The rest of you warn the teachers. I'll finish putting the food in the tent. Act fast! Kids shouldn't worry so much. Mr. V has everything under control. She giggled, watching him do one handed push UPS to show off his physique. But the bear! They yelled out, watching Eddie sneak the car keys and Mr. V's phone into his back pocket. Mr. V got up and glared at the class. Alright, you asked for it. Detention! Just as he yelled it out, a deeper growl made everyone freeze. Almost like the Jurassic Park scene, but much, much worse in person. A massive mama bear crashed into our campsite, looking absolutely furious. Let's go! Eddie screamed, leading all the students towards the vehicles. Mister V stuck his head out of his tent. Hey! Where do you guys think you're going? Oh holy mother of Bear! Mister V sprinted out in his flip flops and tripped, face planting into the dirt. Miss Dyson didn't even stop to help him up, just ran right past and ran to the bus with all the kids. The bear ripped the Mister tense apart before turning her head and charging towards Mister V. Eddie and I quickly started the engine on both vehicles and set Off the alarms and high beams, hoping the bear would leave, Mister V scrambled towards the camp bathroom, locking himself.

I recently started working at a cafe to support myself through university and almost everything is fine. But it's very obvious that my coworker Melanie doesn't like me. Her biggest issue with me is that I speak multiple languages and she hates when I interact with customers in their native language, always saying something like, speak English, they'll understand you or why are you being so extra? Even though I know it makes them comfortable when I speak to them in their native language. I come from Central Europe and in my home country it is mandatory to learn multiple languages in school. I know English, Spanish, German and Dutch, though my accent is very obvious when I speak. The town the cafe is in gets a lot of tourists so I always switch to the language the customer is speaking in if I know it. This has never been a problem until Melanie heard me speaking in a different language and accused me of being spoiled and a privileged little white girl. She told me average people don't speak nor get to learn so many languages and that my daddy's money paid for it. I told her that my family is actually really poor and I never even met my father. But either way, she didn't have A right to speak to me that way. She always tried to pick a fight with me over this. And when I asked a coworker of ours why she reacted that way, they admitted that they suspect she's racist since she said she felt cheated that I hadn't told her I'm polish. Every chance Melanie gets, she tells me that it's disgusting, how I am refusing to see my privilege and how I shouldn't be learning how to speak with local accents because it's verging on appropriation. I only ever saw her at work because I would never willingly hang out with her after everything she said to me. But one night I was invited to go out with my co workers and I didn't realize that Melanie had also been invited. I tried my best to avoid her and just stuck next to Mark, one of my co workers that I have a crush on. We were basically with each other all night and barely interacted with the rest of the group. Mark also speaks Spanish and I caught myself throwing in random Spanish words in our conversation. He laughed about how I sounded like a TV character who would say I Karamba out of nowhere. And I felt like we were really bonding over this simple thing. There I say he liked me back. It wasn't until days later that I found out Melanie also had a crush on Mark, which would explain her actions throughout the night. We started playing games at some point and Melanie asked me about the languages I spoke. She pretended to be impressed when I told her and pulled out Google Translate, of all things, to ask me questions in the languages I mentioned. I answered every single one. And when she switched to Spanish, I saw a light bulb flicker in her head. I didn't know what that was about at the time, but it turns out she thought I was showing off by speaking Spanish to Mark and wanted to embarrass me. When I answered in Spanish, she stopped me mid sentence and told me she couldn't believe how bad my pronunciation was. She laughed at me and tried to get others to join in, but it was just very awkward. She told me that after hearing my English, she thought my Spanish would be better. Mark and I just looked at each other very confused. I said my pronunciation wasn't wrong. I just Learned Spanish by watching Argentinean soap operas. That's why my accent sounds the way it does. She told me to stop lying and to just admit that it wasn't good. But Mark chimed in and told her that I did, in fact, speak with said accent and it's not wrong. My Spanish was excellent. Melanie told him that he didn't have to pretend to not hurt my feelings, that I had to accept that I'm not good at everything. I was baffled. I burst out laughing. And I can tell she was pissed. I said she shouldn't speak about things she knows nothing about and that she was being an a hole. I went home after that and Mark actually walked me home. He kept my mind off the entire situation and just talked about random things. Talking to him felt so natural that I asked if he wanted to talk more in my apartment. One thing LED to another and I can say for sure that he does like me back. The next day, Melanie came over to my house to apologize for her behavior, though it was hardly an apology.

My sister died when my niece Chloe was 12 and her dad basically disappeared after that. So Chloe moved in with me and my husband. He was this quiet kid who barely talked for the first year, which honestly broke my heart because my sister was the loudest person alive. By the time Chloe turned 15, she started opening up more. She tell me about school, drama, boys she thought were cute, normal teenage stuff. But then junior year, she started acting different. She get weird when her friends talked about guys and she stopped mentioning crushes all together. I figured she was just focusing on school. One night she was helping me make dinner when she goes, Aunt Jamie, what would you do if someone in our family was gay? I'm stirring pasta sauce trying to act casual and I said something like, love them the exact same way I always have. She got quiet after that. A few weeks later, she brought home this girl named Alex for a study session, except they weren't studying anything. They were sitting way too close on the couch sharing earbuds and Chloe was laughing more than I'd seen in years. When Alex left, Chloe had this dopey smile that gave everything away.

Mom's eating breakfast scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading Life 3, 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work hard time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest, she says. If we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear, which sounds like something a dictator would say. But whatever, she makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realise immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3, 60 doesn't just show where you are. It shows your speed when driving, your phone battery and sends notification for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect. Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is, men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realize she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom, check your location. While I'm at school, dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realize she's literally sitting there refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day three, mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 and a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit, which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses a client worth $2,000. Week 2, she sees I stopped at McDonald's for 3 minutes and lectures me about wasting money, which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for 4 hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and asks her 4 hours at one store? And mom stares at me like I should have warned her he was checking, but how can I when she's watching my every move? She used To text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until. Eleven PM Dad mentions, that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough, but I've been to that clinic. They close at 6 that night. Dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits, and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives marked final notice, and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that. And mom says, processing delay.

When I had a seizure during parent teacher conferences and the paramedic found college applications in my backpack. I was 11. I woke up to machines beeping. Hospital again. My parents faces were white with terror. Oh, thank god. Mom sobbed. You stopped breathing, doctor. These held up papers covered in my handwriting. These fell out when we were checking vitals. Why? Princeton's biomedical program aligns with my 17 years of life experience. Care to explain? My heart monitor spiked. It would kill me. Literally. I was helping my sister edit. Editing? He showed another page. This is your handwriting across 16 different essays. SAT prep notes, A P, chemistry formulas. His voice hardened. When do you sleep? 4 to 7:00am, I whispered. Mom gasped. Three hours, sometimes two. Jada needs her assignments by midnight so she can copy them in her handwriting for morning submission. How long? Dad's voice was deadly quiet. Since she got into private school two years ago. The doctor pulled up my medical records. That explains the weight loss, malnutrition, three previous ER visits for exhaustion you said were playground accidents. She made me promise. She made you? Mom's voice cracked. How the words tumbled out. She has videos of me praying at Grandpa's grave, begging him to come back. She added circus music, labeling it psycho brother talks to dirt. Said she'd make sure every kid at school sees Me as the freak who kisses headstones. That's not all. I continued shaking. She found Mom's antidepressants. Took pictures of me holding them. Said she tell everyone I was stealing drugs, that I was a lunatic doctor. They sat down hard. This is blackmail! Criminal blackmail! She's just stressed about school. Stop defending her! Dad exploded his fist, slammed the wall, leaving a dent. I've never seen him shake with rage before. You're in the hospital. The doctor pulled up more tests. Cortisol levels are dangerously high. Blood pressure of a 40 year old executive. You've developed an ulcer. You're 11 years old. Burning out like a Wall Street banker. But her scholarship is based on fraud, mom said quietly. The same mom who once grounded Jada for three months for a B+ in math. Who installed life three 60 on both our phones. Where is she? During all this homework time? I went silent. Peter's apartment. The college boy who bought her alcohol. Who she lost her virginity to last month. While I wrote her valedictorian speech. Speech about integrity with study group. I lied. Doctor Thies's phone rang. Hello? Missus of lunar? Yes, he's awake. He listened. Face darkening. Bring everything. My teacher arrived with a box. Hundreds of papers. All Jada's assignments, all my handwriting. I ran them through plagiarism software. She said they match essays. This 11 year old submitted to youth writing contests. Been using his own brilliant work for her assignments. Jada burst in her Private school uniform. Perfect. Why was I pulled from practice? Sit down, dad commanded. Is the little faker seriously getting attention again? Fake Aker! Mom stood. He just had a seizure. From doing your homework? Jada rolled her eyes. So dramatic. Just like when Grandpa died. I flinched, she smirked. Mrs. Lunar spread out the papers. Two years of academic fraud. Every single assignment. So what? I'm utilizing him. Utilizing? Mrs. Lunar's voice shook. Essay is about chemical engineering. This one is your personal essay to Princeton. Jada started to yell. He's getting exposure to advanced topics. I'm basically homeschooling him. You're exploiting him, dad said quietly. Jada laughed. Please. Without my guidance, he never push himself. I give him deadlines, structure, purpose. I'm practically doing him a favor. A favor? Mom held up his medical chart. Ulcers, malnutrition. Three hospitalizations, now a seizure. He's always been weak. Essay about your grandfather's death. You submitted his pain as your own, missus alooner interrupted. Grandpa loved me more anyway, Jada said coldly. Her principal arrived within the hour. We have two options. Press criminal charges for fraud and blackmail, or academic expulsion with permanent record. I don't want to hurt her. You're ruining my life! Jada lunged at me. Security held her back as she screamed. I should have destroyed you when I had the chance. Why? I asked, tears streaming. I'm your brother. You're nothing. A tool!

Two years later, I walked into his family's house as his brother's fiance. It was the last day of high school senior year, the day I planned on confessing my feelings to my childhood friend Jeremy. Before I could, Taylor, the pretty senior everyone wanted to date, cornered me by my locker after third period. Her smile was sweet, laced with bitterness. You need to stop hovering around Jeremy, she said, flipping her gorgeous blonde hair over her shoulder. He doesn't want you around. I felt my cheeks burn. Yes, he does. We're friends. He doesn't mind it. Oh, let's go ask him. Before I could protest, she grabbed my wrist and dragged me across the cafeteria where Jeremy sat with his basketball teammates. Everyone was watching. She dropped my arm by the entrance and hopped over to them. My heart pounded as she put on her sweetest voice, practically purring as she leaned against his chair. Hey, I've been wondering, she said, playing with his shoulder, is Sarah your girlfriend or what? Everyone at that table laughed. Sarah, the nerd with the braces? Are you dating her, man? One of his teammates asked. I would never go out with her, he said, loud enough for the nearby tables to hear. We're not even friends. She just likes doing homework. Oh, that's cold, they said, bursting into laughter. Taylor glanced back at me with a smirk that said everything. I Ran straight to the bathroom, where I locked myself in stall and cried until my eyes were too swollen to hide. Ever since we were little, we've been best friends. We studied together, played together, went on family trips. We even made matching friendship bracelets. Camp. And the way he looked at me when it was just the two of us. I really thought he'd fallen for me, too. But after that day in the cafeteria, I disappeared from his life completely. I took different hallways to avoid him. I ate lunch in the library. I stopped coming to Sunday dinners, telling my mom I had too much homework. He started dating Taylor the day after, hurting me. Eventually, I had the courage to return all of his stuff. Everything he had given me over the years. I made sure to go when he'd be at practice. But when I walked into their garage, his older brother Connor was under the hood of a car, our sleeves rolled up, grease covering his arms. Hey, Sarah, he said, sliding out from under the car. Haven't seen you around lately. You okay? I felt tears build up from his warm question. Just returning everything. He smiled. I'm proud of you. Oh, hey, actually, before you leave, do you mind helping me with something here? Your hands are a lot smaller than mine. I know. He stood behind me, guiding my hand gently into the engine bay. Just feel for the loose bolt. For me? What's this part do? I asked. His face lit up. You actually want to know? He stood there explaining how engines worked, completely nerding out while I still awkwardly had my hand on the bolt. I laughed loudly. Hey, before you continue, mind telling me what else I'm supposed to do with this? Oh, sorry! He yelled. We spent the rest of the time having fun, talking about cars and his dream to open a shop. And I found myself coming back again and again when Jeremy wasn't home. Six months later, we were dating, both enrolled in trade school, both building something real together. After trade school and a year year of flipping cars, we opened our first shop. With both families investing, the business exploded through word of mouth. Halfway through the year, we'd expanded to three bays with a waiting list for appointments. Meanwhile, Jeremy was overwhelmed. Ever since Taylor got pregnant, he had to juggle college classes with two part time jobs, all while she showed up on campus accusing him of cheating with imaginary college girls, tracking his location.

When my daughter was three years old, instead of teaching her the word look, I taught her the word behold. And so from that day on, every time she wanted to show me something, she tug my arm and say, daddy, daddy, behold. My wife and I thought it was extremely funny and innocent. And it was. Until it wasn't. Fast forward a few weeks. My daughter and I were grocery shopping, and as I was picking out some apples, my daughter started tugging my arm. Daddy, daddy, behold the vegetable. She then pointed at a man in a wheelchair 20 feet away. My jaw dropped and I started laughing my head off. I knew I shouldn't laugh, but hearing my four year old daughter say that combination of words sent me into hysterics. Well, the man turned his head directly at me. He saw me laughing my butt off, all while my daughter was pointing straight at him. He gave me a dirty look and rolled away. And when he did, I felt so embarrassed. I turned to my daughter, who was very confused about what was so funny, and I told her she couldn't point at disabled people or call them that word. What's a disabled person? She innocently asked me. Don't play dumb with me, Missy. I responded, no, I'm serious, daddy. I was a little taken aback. Well, a person in a wheelchair, Is called a disabled person, and the word vegetable should never be used when talking about them. Got it? She nodded. Okay, daddy, but I didn't mean behold the disabled person. I mean behold the vegetables. She then pointed in the same direction she did previously, but now, with the man gone, it was obvious that the whole time she had been pointing at the vegetable aisle.

Is this some sort of joke? I asked when the officer said those strange words. Instead of asking for license and registration, the cop handed back my license that I'd already pulled out. His face had changed from stern authority to something softer and sadder. I just got radioed in about what happened. Terribly sorry for your loss, sir. Before I could ask what loss? He was already jogging back to his patrol car. He turned on his lights again, but this time pulled in front of me and blocked traffic so I could merge left immediately. Other cars moved aside as he created a clear path for me to speed the head. I sat there frozen for a moment before pressing the gas. My hands were trembling on the steering wheel as I tried to process what just happened. The cop knew something I didn't. Something bad enough that he'd let me go without even a warning about my speed. I fumbled for my phone while keeping one eye on the road. I just landed at LAX an hour ago after a three day business trip to see Seattle. My wife Carly hadn't answered when I called from baggage claim, but that wasn't unusual. She often had her phone on silent while teaching her kindergarten class. I called her again. Straight to voicemail. I tried our home phone. Nothing. My chest Started feeling tight as I scrolled to her sister's number. Voicemail. Her mom. Voicemail. My mom. No answer. The highway stretched ahead of me, but I wasn't really seeing it anymore. My mind was racing through possibilities. Car accident, house fire, something at her school. Each scenario worse than the last. The cop had said lost. That word kept echoing in my head. Finally, I called my brother Harvey. It rang four times before his wife, Paulina, answered. She was crying so hard, I could barely understand her. How can she do this? I don't understand why she would do this. Paulina kept repeating between sobs, what? What happened? Where's Carly? Is she okay? I was practically shouting into the phone. Paulina just cried harder. I heard Harvey's voice in the background telling her to give him the phone. There shuffling and muffled voices before the line went dead. I called back three times, but no one answered. I was doing 90 now, weaving between cars. Other drivers honked, but I didn't care. Something had happened to my wife, and no one would tell me what. The exit was coming up, and I took it without signaling. I knew that's where they take her. It was the closest trauma center to her school. The hospital parking lot was a maze, but I abandoned my car in the first spot I saw. Legal or not, I didn't care. I ran through the sliding doors into the emergency room lobby. The smell. Of disinfectant, and fear hit me immediately. I'm looking for my wife, Carly Munos. She was brought here. I didn't even know when or why. The nurse at the desk type something into her computer. When she looked back up at me, her eyes were watery. She knew who I was before I'd even given my name. The security guard will escort you. Her voice was barely a whisper. A large man in a blue uniform appeared and gestured for me to follow. We walked through endless hallways, past rooms full of beep machines and worried families. My legs felt like they might give out, but I kept moving. The guard didn't say a word, just kept glancing at me with that same sad look everyone seemed to have. We took an elevator to the third floor pediatric ICU. The sign said, why were we in pediatrics if Carly was hurt? My brain couldn't make sense of it. The guard LED me down another hallway, where I could hear crying. Multiple people sobbing behind a closed door. I recognized voices as we got closer. Harvey. Paulina. Carly.

Everyone knew Gabby was more than just our big sister. She became our mom the day ours died. When she was 18, Gabby taught my brother how to shave, stayed up all night when my youngest sister had nightmares, and somehow made four teenagers feel safe in a world that had just collapsed. But last Thanksgiving changed everything forever. Gabby had been trying to have a baby for three years. At 38, her doctor said IVF was her only shot, but insurance wouldn't cover it at $15,000 per round. She called a family meeting after Sunday dinner, her hands shaking as she explained, I've never asked you guys for anything, but I need help. I know it's a lot of money. We all said we'd figure it out together. Everyone hugged her that night. Liam said, of course we'll help. You deserve this. Becca literally cried, saying, I've always wanted to be an aunt. Kelsey promised to set up a payment plan for all of us. Gabby was glowing. This was her dream. She booked the appointment for next month, texting us, they need the deposit Tuesday at three PM. We can all meet there. Everyone responded with thumbs up and heart emojis. She started a spreadsheet showing how if each of us contributed $3,000, she could start treatment next month. She sent us IVF success stories and potential baby names. Even asked Becca to be be her Birth partner. But then Liam bought a new BMW. That week, Becca booked a month long Europe trip with her husband. Kelsey renovated her entire kitchen. Gabby saw everything, but stayed quiet. Tuesday, I got to the clinic at 2:45 with $2,000 all I could scrape together. Gabby was already there, dressed up, smiling while clutching her purse. They're coming, right? She kept asking. 3 p m. Past 3:34 p m. She kept calling. No answer. The clinic closed. I held her hand as she had to cancel the appointment. Liam texted the group chat first. Can't swing it right now. Tight month. Becca same. Sorry. Kelsey just sent a sad face emoji. Gabby replied, I understand. And nothing else. Later that night, I found her on the floor, sobbing in the nursery. She'd already started decorating, holding the baby clothes she bought on sale. She didn't know I could see her from the hallway as she saw into a tiny yellow onesie that said, worth the wait. I held her as she shook. I really thought they'd come, she whispered. Two months later, at Mom's death anniversary dinner, Gabby brought it up one last time. She'd found a clinic that offered payment plans and only needed $2,000 from each of us to start. I'm running out of time, she said quietly. Please, I've never asked for anything else. I laughed. Gabby, maybe motherhood just isn't meant for you. I mean, you've never even been married. Liam nodded. Yeah, and You already raised us. Isn't that enough for you? Kelsey added. It's kind of selfish to bring a kid into the world alone at your age. Gabby's face went completely blank. She slowly looked at each of us. Selfish, Gabby whispered. Then louder. Selfish! She stood up and walked to her bedroom, returning with a large photo album I'd never seen before. She started pulling out birthday cards, dozens of them, spreading them across the table. Liam, your 18th birthday. Read what you wrote. Liam's face reddened as Gabby read it aloud. Gabby, you saved my life. I owe you everything. Every penny I ever make, I owe to you. She grabbed another. Becca, your college graduate

When Uncle Ray died last month, I thought I'd maybe get his old fishing gear or some random furniture. I was his only niece who actually visited him, bringing him groceries and cleaning his tiny apartment every week. He always seemed grateful, but never talked much about family drama or money. The lawyer called me down to his office on a rainy Tuesday. I sat in this fancy leather chair while he read through the will. Most of it was boring legal stuff about bank accounts and his beat up Honda. Then he reached into a locked drawer and pulled out a metal box. Your uncle left specific instructions for this, he said, sliding it across the desk. Inside was a small black pistol wrapped in cloth, along with registration papers showing it was legally his. Underneath was a handwritten note and Uncle Ray's messy writing. Don't trust him. Check the basement, R. I had no idea what that meant. Don't trust who? Uncle Ray lived alone and barely talked to anyone except me and his neighbor, Missus Chen, who brought him soup sometimes. The lawyer said he couldn't explain anything more, just that I was supposed to get the gun and note exactly as written. That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the basement thing. Uncle Ray's apartment was on the first floor of this old duplex, but there was A basement that the landlord used for storage. I'd never been down there, but Uncle Ray had mentioned it once when his water heater broke. I decided to drive over the next day. The building looked different in daylight, more run down than I remembered. I found the landlord, this guy named Pete, who I'd met once when Uncle Ray was having plumbing issues. He seemed nervous when I asked about going to the basement. Your uncle was always complaining about noises down there, Pete said. Jangling his keys. Probably just rats or something. But when he opened the basement door, I could tell something was wrong. There were fresh footprints in the dust boxes. That looks like they've been moved recently. In the back corner, behind the water heater, I found a loose floorboard. When I pried it up, there was a plastic bag with photos inside. They showed Pete going through Uncle Ray's apartment when Ray wasn't home. In one picture, Pete was clearly looking through Ray's mail. In another, he was at Ray's computer. I confronted Pete upstairs, and his whole story fell apart. Turns out he'd been stealing from elderly tenants for years. He would copy their keys, go through their stuff when they were out, and even steal their identity information. Uncle Ray had figured it out and started taking pictures from his window. Pete got angry and started moving toward me. But then I remembered the gun in my car. I didn't pull it. Out or anything, but knowing I had it made me feel safer. I told Pete I was calling the cops, and he better not follow me. The police found way more evidence in Pete's apartment. Bank statements, stolen mail, even credit cards belonging to other tenants. Uncle Ray had been building a case against him, but died before he could report it. The craziest part. Uncle Ray had been slowly moving his valuable stuff to a storage unit because he knew Pete was watching him. The gun wasn't just for Protection. It was his way of making sure I'd be safe when I discovered the truth. I still have that gun locked away safely.

I smiled. I haven't heard of that one. Her words slurred from the laughing gas. It's when we hear daddy's car and everyone freezes like statues. My hygienist, Sierra, raised an eyebrow. That sounds interesting. How do you play? When we hear the garage, Mommy says statue time and we all freeze wherever we are, Isabella explained drowsily. Even if I'm eating or playing, everything stops. That's when I noticed the faint yellow marks on her upper arm, mostly hidden by her sleeve. Sometimes I'm really good at it. Last week I held my spoon in the air for 20 whole minutes. She seemed proud. Mommy said I was the best statue ever. Twenty minutes is a long time, I said, gently adjusting her sleeve to see better. Fingerprint bruises? Old ones. Can you raise your arm for me, sweetie? I need to adjust the chair. As she raised both arms, her shirt rode up. Linear marks crossed her lower back, some scarred, some fresh. What happens if someone moves during statue time? I kept working, acting like I was just doing my job. That's losing. Daddy doesn't like when we lose. I excused myself to get a different tool, stepping to my computer to pull up our mandatory reporting protocols. When I returned, I asked casually, and if you win the statue game? If we're all good statues, daddy walks through and goes To his room. Then we can breathe normal again. Sometimes he even says good job. And we get to eat dinner. You get to eat dinner? Only if we win. Losers don't deserve dinner. But mommy sneaks me crackers later. I made a show of checking Isabella's chart while secretly measuring the bruise patterns with my pen light. 3 2 cm spread on the grip marks. Adult male hand size. Isabella, what other games does your family play? I asked. Oceaning my hygiene to discreetly check on the father. The listening game, where he asks questions and we have to answer exactly right. I pulled out my light. Open wide again. What kind of questions? Like who's the most important person in this house? The answer is always daddy. The light revealed slight scarring on her inner cheek, likely from biting during stress. What happens when someone gets the answer wrong? Sometimes no breakfast or lunch. My tummy hurts so bad, but crying makes it worse. My least favorite one is the quiet room. I set down my tools. Tell me about this quiet room. While I set up this X ray. I positioned the lead apron, noting how she winced when I touched her shoulders. It's the closet under the stairs. No light. We stay until we're sorry enough. I count to know how long I lasted. My record is 10,000 seconds. It's yours. The excitement in her voice broke my heart. That was over two and a half Hours. That's a lot of counting, Sierra returned, mouthing. Her dad's asking how much longer you'll be. Mommy went in there last week, Isabella continued. She had to fold up real small cause she's bigger. Daddy said she forgot who pays the bills. Sometimes I hear her crying in there, but I can't help or I go in, too. We Learned that rule the hard way. I took the X rays, handed her some stickers, and said, I need to develop these. Sierra will stay with you in the hallway. I called CPS from my cell. Active abuse case. Child has physical marks. Describes systematic torture disguised as games. Father is in waiting room. Returning, I pretended to review her chart. Isabella, has anyone else seen you play these games? No. Oh, silly. It's a family secret. Daddy says other people wouldn't understand our special rules. I gently examined her neck, finding more old bruises hidden by her hair. Does your teacher know about the statue game? No. We're really good at keeping secrets. Paul's getting good, too. He hasn't cried in the quiet room for three weeks. He's only six. The neighbors called the police once about the screaming. Now he just hits his head against the wall, but real soft. So no

My dad banned me from the internet completely. No computer, no tablet, no phone with data. At 17, I was the only kid writing papers on a typewriter. When I tried using a library computer for two minutes to check college applications, Dad's tracking apps alerted him instantly. Scream so loud on the phone that everyone stared. The librarian asked me to leave. He reported my friend's mom to child services after she let me use their laptop. The investigation took three months. I wasn't allowed at their house anymore. Dad smiled when I told him. Another bad influence eliminated. My aunt visited for Thanksgiving. She watched me handwriting a 20 page paper, and something changed in her face. After dinner, she pulled me into the bathroom and locked the door. Your dad just started new arthritis medication, she whispered, hands shaking. It's called meloxicam. My dispatch center has had three emergency calls this month. Severe allergic reactions to this exact medication. One man died in his kitchen. She pulled out an old tablet. For reading only, she said loudly, then grabbed my shoulders. I've downloaded everything you need. Medical guides, emergency protocols. All offline so he can't track it. She made me look directly at her. If someone's allergic to meloxicam, and it happens fast, 10 to 15 minutes after taking it, their throat swells from the inside, like a balloon inflating in their windpipe. You have five minutes from the First symptom to complete airway closure. She described what I'd see. Red welts spreading like spilled paint. Lips puffing out. The tongue swelling so big it pushes out of their mouth. The person's face turns purple while they claw at their throat. They can't scream because their vocal cords are swelling shut. Just this horrible whistling sound that gets quieter until it stops. Every morning at 5:00am, while dad did his workout, I hid under my blanket, studying that tablet. The photos made me sick. Faces so swollen they didn't look human. Purple lips, eyes bulging from pressure. I read about how people waste time during anaphylaxis. They look for car keys, thinking they can drive themselves. They call relatives instead of 9 1 1. By the time they realize they're dying, their throat is too swollen to speak. Die holding their phones, unable to give their address. I practiced dialing 9 1 1 in my head over and over. Anaphylaxis. Medication, allergy. Send epinephrine. Short sentences, clear information. I memorized it like a prayer. Tuesday morning, dad took his arthritis pill with orange juice. I watched him swallow it and check the clock. Ten minutes later, he started scratching his neck. Turn down the heat, he said. But I can see my breath in the kitchen. He kept scratching harder. Red welts spread up from his collar. His lips started puffing out. He touched them with confusion that turned to fear. When he stood, his chair crashed backward. He Pointed at his throat and tried to speak, but only horrible wheezing came out. His tongue was swelling, pushing out of his mouth. He lunged for the landline and put it to his ear. Nothing. He clicked the receiver frantically. Still dead. He hadn't paid the Bill in two months. Because landlines are scams. His cell phone was upstairs, charging. The realization hit him. We had no way to call for help. His face was turning purple. Hives erupted everywhere. He dropped to his knees with both hands around his throat. The wheezing was getting quieter. That whistling sound aunt warned me about. He pointed down desperately at his car keys, tried to stand, but his legs gave out. He crashed into the table and plates shattered. Then he was crawling toward the door. He made it five feet before collapsing face first. His lips were dark blue, the whistling almost gone. He rolled onto his back and his eyes found mine. Pure terror. My father. Who

They sent this email at like, 3 in the morning, which was real helpful when I'm already asleep and have to work the next day. I'm scrambling around trying to find someone to watch my kid because I literally could not miss work that day. Had this huge presentation that would basically make or break my job. So I'm calling everyone I know at like, 6:00am. The only person who picks up is my step brother's girlfriend, Ashley. He doesn't work, just sits around all day while my step brother pays for everything. I mean everything. Her daily Starbucks runs, weekly nail appointments, the whole designer purse collection. It's been trying to get her to do literally anything productive for years, but whatever. I'm desperate. I call her up, and she's like, oh, sure, I can totally watch him for you. I'm thinking, finally, someone's actually gonna help me out. Then she hits me with it. My family rate is $200 for six hours. I literally had to ask her to repeat that because I thought I heard wrong. $200, six hours to watch one kid who mostly just plays with his tablet anyway? Are you being serious right now? I asked. She goes on this whole speech about how this is her livelihood and she takes childcare very seriously and that she's already giving me a family discount. I'm thinking, what livelihood? You haven't worked? A day since you moved in with my stepbrother three years ago. But I'm stuck. If. If I don't show up to work that day, I'm literally getting fired. So I agree to her insane price, and she demands the money up front before I even drop my kid off. I hand over $200 cash, drive to work fuming, and end up working barely four hours after you factor in traffic. So I basically paid 50 bucks an hour for her to sit on her couch and make sure my kid didn't burn the house down. Fast forward two years. Ashley and my step brother break up, but somehow she ends up living rent free in his dad's extra house and driving my dad's old car. My step brother still pays all her bills because they have a kid together now. She finally gets a job at some retail place because he stopped funding her weekly spa days. Then last month, I get this panicked text in our family group chat. Emergency! My babysitter bailed and I have to work today or I'll get fired. Can anyone watch my daughter, please? I'm desperate. I'm reading this text, and I can't help but smile a little. I text her back super fast, I can totally help you out. I'll watch her. She's so relieved and grateful, sending me heart emojis and everything. I hit her with the kicker. My family rate is $200 for the day. The typing bubbles appear and Disappear, like, five times, then my phone starts blowing up. Are you kidding me right now? That's way too much. I thought we were family. You're being ridiculous. I just screenshot our old conversation from two years ago and send it back to her. This is the exact same rate you charged me.

I thought everyone had to check their mattress for cockroaches before lying down, until I was 15 years old and went to someone else's house for the first time. My morning routine involved shaking out my shoes because mice nested in them overnight. I also had to brush maggots off my backpack because the smell of rotting meat from somewhere deep in the house attracted flies that laid eggs on everything. The path to the bathroom required stepping on compressed newspapers that squished with mystery liquids that had been leaking from garbage bags since 2,011. Sometimes I'd hear crunching when I accidentally stepped on the bones of one of our cats that died and got buried under trash before anyone noticed. My breakfast came from sealed packages only because I once almost ate cereal that was full of ants. A lot of the time, I had to pee in bottles because the path to the toilet got blocked by the collapsing mountain of adult diapers my mother bought in bulk. Nobody in our house needed them, but she insisted they'd be worth money during the next pandemic. When Parker transferred to our school and picked me to be his history partner, I tried to convince him to switch. I knew eventually he'd want to meet outside school, but he had already turned in the paper with our names and said it would be too much hassle to change it now. He kept Pushing to work at my house until I finally made up this whole story about my grandmother being sick. Said that she was super contagious and had something doctors couldn't figure out. He suggested his place instead and even offered to pick me up so I wouldn't have to take a bus. I said the bus didn't run to his neighborhood, even though really, I just didn't want to trap him in a car with my. I've been washing my clothes in the bathroom sink at school with the pink hand soap and drying them under the hand dryer, but the smell of decomposition and ammonia had gotten into the fabric permanently. Walking into his house broke my brain because my eyes didn't know what to do with all of the empty floor space. It took me, like 10 seconds to realize those white things were actual walls that didn't have brown roach stains, water damage, black streaks from whatever gross fungus was eating our house from the inside. His kitchen had a table with nothing on it, just empty space where people could put plates and eat food like normal people. When he opened a cabinet, there were dishes stacked all neat. Instead of falling out in this avalanche of broken stuff and mouse poop, he pulled out two clean glasses without having to wash them first or check for dead bugs inside. The refrigerator opened without having to throw your whole body against it because the seal wasn't Broken from years of nasty inside were leftovers in containers with actual lids, and vegetables that were green like they're supposed to be instead of brown liquid in plastic bags. The milk was just milk, not chunks floating in yellow water. When he said, god, my mom is such a neat freak. It's honestly embarrassing how she makes me clean my room every single day while pointing at a bedroom that looked like something from a movie, I made this weird choking sound like an animal being strangled. I started crying so hard I puked on his clean carpet. He got me water in a glass that didn't even have gross film on it and helped me to his bathroom where I could wash my face in a sink that was white, not brown. The sink had regular water that didn't smell like rotten eggs. I finally stopped crying. He just said, you can come here whenever you need to without asking why. Seeing a normal house made me completely lose it. When his mom drove me home later, I tried to get her to stop at the corner, but she insisted on taking me to my actual house because it was getting dark. When we pulled up to my place, I saw Parker and his mom staring at the newspapers covering every window. From inside, they saw all of the shopping carts my mother stole from grocery stores rusted and piled in the yard, and the dead tree covered In moldy plastic bags she hung to dry so she could use them again, even though they were covered in mold and bird crap. Parker's mom tried to hide it, but I could see she was horrified. Parker grabbed my arm before I got out and whispered, my mom says you can stay at our house whenever you need to. And I knew they understood everything without me having to. I thanked them both and ran inside, being careful to not open the door enough for them to see the disaster inside. That night, while my mother was passed out, I started with one corner of my room and filled a trash bag with obvious garbage, including food wrappers from when I was in elementary school and tissues so old they turned to dust when I touched them. My mother screamed at me when she noticed things were missing, but I kept going. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more!

All communication through my lawyer. I replied, understood. Then I canceled all her credit cards and cut financial support. Three days later, her lawyer called, panicking. Tuesday afternoon, buried in work, my phone buzzed. The message for my wife, Amber was brutal. Leonardo, I want a divorce. All future communication through my lawyer, Mr. Morgan. Fifteen years of marriage ended with a single text. We had dinner the night before and talked weekend plans. Nothing suggested this. I stared at the message for five minutes while shock, hurt and anger swirled beneath. But cold clarity emerged. She set the terms. Lawyers only, I replied. Understood. Practicality took over, since legal channels meant informal arrangements were void. She had supplementary cards on my accounts with authorized user status, not joint ownership. Thirty minutes of clicking. Credit cards canceled, monthly allowance stopped, Netflix and prime, logged out with passwords changed. The car she drives is leased in my name, and her gas card was tied to the canceled credit card. Not revenge, just accepting the new reality. She dictated. Her lawyer's details arrived an hour later. I forwarded them to Miss Luna, the best divorce attorney my colleague recommended. Went home to an empty house. She packed while I worked. Friday afternoon, unknown number calls. Is this Leonardo? Sharp VOICE speaking. This is Mr. Morgan. I represent Amber. My client is experiencing difficulties. Her cards declined. Funds cut off abruptly. I kept my voice level. Mister Morgan, my wife demanded divorce Tuesday, stating all communication must go through you. I complied. Informal financial arrangements ceased. Long pause. She needs funds now. Accommodation. Accommodation? Where is she staying? You acted in bad faith, cutting her off without warning. Mister Morgan, my wife ended our marriage via text and established the lawyer's only rule. Financial support will be determined legally, not by frantic calls over declined cards. My client seeks emergency financial relief. Her prerogative. Direct all filings to my attorney. Miss Luna. Conversation concluded per my wife's directive. Good day. Heart pounding as I hung up. She wanted cold and legal. She's getting it. Exactly. Within hours. Amber's best friend Haley called, furious. What the hell, Leonardo? Amber's on my couch. You cut her off completely? Haley, Amber demanded divorce via text. Lawyers only. I respected her wishes. You know she barely works. How can she survive? She hired a lawyer before talking to me. Process she chose. This is cruel. After 15 years following her exact instructions. I would have discussed things amicably if she hadn't nuked our marriage via text. And immediately lawyer up. She'll take you for everything. Haley spat. She can try. Everything goes through legal channels now. The emergency support hearing came three weeks later. Amber looks stressed, avoiding my gaze. Mr. Morgan argued she was destitute, victimized by my actions. Miss Luna calmly presented the divorce text and bank statements showing I canceled supplementary access after receiving divorce demands. Proof I still paid mortgage, utilities, insurance. The kicker evidence of Amber attempting to drain a forgotten joint savings account with $500. Trying to work around the legal process she demanded. Judge wasn't buying the victim narrative. Asked Amber directly why no prior discussion before texting divorce demands. She mumbled about being intimidated. Judge seemed skeptical. Result? Temporary support ordered closer to our figure than their astronomical demands.

So my husband, Jake, has this thing where he thinks he knows everything about cars, like everything. He grew up working on engines with his dad and acts like that makes him some kind of expert mechanic. The problem is, he's not. Last Tuesday, I was driving home from work in my Honda Civic when I started hearing this weird grinding noise from the front wheels. It wasn't super loud, but it was definitely there. I pulled into our driveway and told Jake about it right away. He barely looked up from his phone. It's probably just your brake squeaking. They do that sometimes. I told him it didn't sound like squeaking. It sounded more like metal grinding against metal and it was getting worse. He rolled his eyes. Babe, I've been working on cars since I was 12. Trust me, it's fine. The next morning, same thing. The grinding was even louder now, especially when I turned left. I told Jake again and this time he actually came outside to listen. He had me start the car and drive it around the block while he stood there with his arms crossed like some kind of professional. When I got back, he shook his head, see, nothing, you're being paranoid. But I wasn't being paranoid. Thursday morning on my way to work, the grinding was so loud, other drivers were looking at me at red lights. I called Jake, during my lunch break, I'm taking the car to a mechanic after work. Something is seriously wrong. He got annoyed. Don't waste our money on some guy who's gonna try to sell you stuff you don't need. I'm telling you, the car is fine. Friday morning, I was driving to pick up groceries when it happened. I was turning left into the parking lot when the grinding turned into this horrible screeching sound. And then the car just started pulling hard to the right. I had to grip the steering wheel with both hands to keep it straight. My heart was pounding as I managed to park. I called Jake immediately. Something just happened with the car. I think the wheel bearing went out or something. He sighed like I was bothering him. You probably just hit a pothole wrong. Drive it home and I'll look at it this weekend. I, I told him I didn't think it was safe to drive. He said, it's fine. Cars don't just break down like that. That's when I hung up and called my mom. My mom has never claimed to know anything about cars, but she has common sense. I, I told her what was happening, and she didn't hesitate. Don't drive that car anywhere. Call a tow truck and get it to a mechanic right now. I'll pay for it if Jake gives you grief. The mechanic took one look at my car and his face got serious. Ma'am, you're Lucky you didn't crash. Your front wheel bearing completely failed. If you'd kept driving on this, the wheel could have locked up or even come off while you were on the highway. The repair cost 600 bucks.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We'd known each other since freshman year. And when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything, 50 50, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird serious face she starts with. So I've been thinking and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. But she's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue because honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I tell her, fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realize I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says, okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the TV and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realized she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that really made me laugh. When I was packing up the kitchen stuff, I realized I'd bought all the cooking supplies, too, the pans, the good knife set, even the can opener. I left her with basically nothing except a mini fridge and some random cups she had from high school. By the time I finished loading everything, the apartment looked like nobody had ever lived there. Just empty rooms with.

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy Robert, looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let me guess, looking for a rich boyfriend? Smart girl. Lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colors are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interesting perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me, and continued his lecture. A girl like you probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do. Flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was familiar, With the artist's work. Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the Pretty Pictures doesn't count as being familiar with Art, Sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes from decades of study, not whatever you Learned from TikTok. Robert decided to test me. Rapid firing questions. Who's Basquiat? What's Kiara Scuro? Name three Renaissance painters besides da Vinci. When I started to answer, he cut me off. Wrong. See, this is why galleries shouldn't have open events. You probably googled some terms before coming here to impress men, but Riley here is working in a tradition you couldn't possibly understand without a proper education. Not community college, sweetie. Real universities. He returned to my painting, now explaining it louder to draw a crowd. What Riley has achieved here would cost probably 100,000 in education to even attempt. The materials alone cost more than you'd make in a month at whatever retail job you have. He looked at my outfit with disgust. Target clearance rack, right? Someone who shops there couldn't possibly grasp the investment in this piece. He probably spent more on one brush than your entire outfit. When I suggested the artist might be self taught, Robert sneered at me. Is that how you Learned about art? Painting parties? Robert grabbed my wrist to me to another angle, his grip too tight. You're too stupid to even stand in the right spot. Riley intended for this to be viewed from exactly here. Your ignorance is actually disrespectful to his work. He kept his hand on my wrist while explaining. Though honestly, explaining this to you is like teaching calculus to a toddler. You lack the basic foundation to understand any of it. He noticed me trying to pull away and squeezed harder. What am I keeping you from taking selfies? This is exactly why serious collectors hate these events. Girls like you come for the free alcohol and to hunt for sugar daddies. You're polluting the space where real art appreciation happens. He waved at a security guard. She's drunk. And her

That's funny. I set her down on the lawn where the paramedics were waiting. I'm serious. I wanna go back. She tried to stand up, but her legs were shaky from smoke inhalation. Why would you wanna do that? I pulled off my helmet, confused by her urgency. I left my family in there. Her eyes were wild with panic. Excuse me. What? I grabbed my radio immediately. I have to go back. I left my family in there. She was crying now and trying to push past me toward the burning house. I called for backup while physically blocking her path. The house was fully engulfed with flames shooting through the roof. We done a sweep of the main floor and found only her path. Passed out in the living room. But if there were more people inside, especially in areas we hadn't checked yet, we needed to move fast. My captain arrived with three other firefighters. I explained the situation while the woman kept sobbing about her family being trapped inside. She said they were in the basement where she'd been doing laundry when the fire started. He'd run upstairs to get help, but got overwhelmed by smoke. We geared up for another entry. The structure was compromised, but if there were victims inside, we had to try. The woman gave us details about the basement layout and where her family Might be. She mentioned hearing them crying when she left, which made my blood run cold. There was no time to waste. Walker and I went in first, while Hensley and Kirk waited as backup. The smoke was thicker now, and visibility was basically zero. We felt our way to the basement door, which was already warm to the touch. Not a good sign. The stairs creaked under our weight, and I wondered if they'd hold. Halfway down, we heard it. Crying sounds coming from somewhere below. My heart raced as we pushed forward. A family was trapped down here, and we were their only hope. The smoke was less dense in the basement, but the heat was intense. Something was very wrong with this fire pattern. We reached the bottom and started searching. The crying seemed to be coming from the back corner, near what looked like a storage area. Boxes and old furniture blocked our path. We started moving things aside, working as fast, fast as we could. The crying got louder as we got closer. That's when the stairs collapsed behind us. The whole structure just gave way in a shower of sparks and burning timber. Walker called it in immediately. We were trapped, but we could hear victims just ahead. No firefighter would leave civilians behind, even if it meant risking our own lives. We kept pushing through the debris. The crying was constant now and sounded like multiple voices, including what seemed like a baby. How could anyone survive down here this long without proper air? The smoke was getting thicker and my air gauge was dropping fast. Finally, we reached the source. Walker pulled aside an old dresser and we both rose. There on the floor was a family of dolls. Baby dolls, child dolls, even adult sized mannequins dressed in clothes. They were arranged like a real family having dinner at a small table. Realizing that there was no way out, Walker said, it's been an honor serving with you all. Full story on channel link below.

But then it started happening when she talked to me, to cashiers, even to my boss when he called the house. Instead of saying normal things like thanks or excuse me, she'd make these weird sounds like Tank Uwu and Scoozie Woozy.

I spent weeks planning everything. Rented a tux, spot a corsage, even practiced my I've liked you since freshman year speech in the mirror. The one thing I insisted on was driving. My friends all wanted to split an Uber, but I had this romantic vision of picking Ebony up in my car, just the two of us having deep conversations on the way there. What I didn't mention was that my car was a 2003 Toyota Camry with a dent in the side and a muffler that sounded like a dying whale. Ebony looked absolutely stunning when I picked her up. She was wearing this gorgeous blue dress, and I was so nervous I could barely speak. The drive to prom was going perfectly. We were talking, laughing, and I was building up the courage to tell her how I felt at prom. Everything was magical. We dance, I danced, took pictures, and I was planning to confess my feelings during the slow songs. But then my friends Jake and Marcus found me around ten PM, completely wasted from pre gaming in the parking lot. Dude, Jake slurred, hanging all over me. We need a ride home right now. Marcus threw up on his date shoes. And we got kicked out of the after party. I tried I to explain that I was having a moment with Ebony, but Marcus was turning green and mumbling about needing to get home before his parents found out he was drunk. Ebony, being the sweet person she is, said, it's okay. We should help them. We can talk later. So there I was, loading two drunk idiots into my Toyota while wearing a 200 dollar tuxedo. Jake immediately claimed shotgun and started messing with my radio while Marcus sprawled across the back seat groaning about his stomach. This car smells weird! Announced loudly, like old French fries and sadness. Ebony squeezed into the back seat next to Marcus, who kept apologizing for ruining prom night while simultaneously asking if we had any snacks. I was driving extra carefully because I had precious cargo, but Jake kept grabbing the steering wheel, saying, dude, you're driving like my grandma. Speed up! Then Marcus suddenly sat up and yelled, pull over! I'm gonna be sick! I swerved to the side of the road so fast that my muffler backfired like a gunshot. Marcus jumped out and started throwing up in someone's front yard while Jake cheered him on like it was a sporting event. That's when the police car pulled up behind us with its lights flashing. Officer Johnson got out, and of course it was the same cop who'd given me a speeding ticket last month. He took one look at Me in my tuxedo, my Toyota with the hood smoking slightly, and two drunk teenagers in formal wear. And just shook his head. Well, well, well, what do we have here? I tried to explain that I was the designated driver, completely sober, just helping my friends, but Jake chose that moment to stumble over and loudly declare,

So I gave my daughter a name she'll never forget. I've been planning to name my daughter Sophia Rose since I was literally 14 years old. I had this whole Pinterest board with nursery ideas, wrote it in my diary about a million times, even practice signing birthday cards with love, Sophia's mom like a complete weirdo. When I got pregnant at 23, everyone in my family knew this was the name. I been talking about it for almost 10 years. But my younger sister Emma always had to make everything about her growing up. If I got a new bike, she needed a better one. If I made honor roll, she suddenly cared about grades. When I announced I was pregnant, she immediately started trying to get pregnant too, even though she'd been with her boyfriend Tyler for only like 8 months and could barely afford rent on her studio apartment. Two months after my announcement, she called me crying happy tears. I'm pregnant too. We can be pregnant together. At first I was excited, sister. Pregnancy sounded cute. We could share maternity clothes, compare weird cravings, complain about swollen feet together. But then she started copying everything I mentioned, craving pickles and ice cream. Suddenly that was her thing too. I bought this gorgeous cream colored crib from target. She showed up with the exact same one three days later when I posted bump photos in my Favorite blue maternity dress. She bought the same dress in pink and posted almost identical pics. The worst part was she kept asking about names. What are you thinking for names? I'm so stuck. You always have the best ideas. I stupidly told her about Sophia Rose because I trusted her. She nodded along, said it was beautiful, even suggested middle name alternatives. At 36 weeks, she went into early labor. I was still two weeks away from my due date, feeling like a whale and scared something was wrong. She texted me from the hospital, she's here, 7 pounds, 2 ounces of perfect. Come meet your niece. I waddled into that hospital room with flowers and a pink teddy bear, so excited to meet my first niece. Emma was glowing in her hospital bed holding this tiny, perfect baby girl. Meet Sophia Rose, she said with the biggest smile. I literally felt my heart stop. What did you just say? Sophia Rose. Tyler, she repeated, like nothing was wrong. Isn't she perfect? The name just felt so right when I saw her little face. You, you were right. It's such a beautiful name. I stood there holding wilted flowers, 38 weeks pregnant with my own daughter, watching my sister cuddle the baby who now had my name, the name I'd planned for almost a decade. Tyler was taking pictures. The nurses were cooing, and I felt like I was watching my dreams get stolen in real time. Emma, that Was my name, I whispered. She looked at me with fake confusion. What do you mean? We never decided on anything official. And she just looked like a Sophia when she came out. You understand, right? You'll find something even better. I left that hospital room crying so hard I could barely see to drive. My husband, Jake, was furious when I told him. She can't just steal your name, he kept saying. But legally, she absolutely could. There's no copyright on baby names. Two weeks later, I gave birth to my.

When I turned 18, my parents sat me down for what they called a long overdue conversation. You need to move out, mom announced. Every disaster in this house happens because you're constantly provoking Gonzales. I stared in disbelief while my 14 year old brother Gonzales sat there looking innocent. The kitchen fire last week, the destroyed laptop, the hole in the garage door. It's always when you two are together. We need peace. You have two weeks to find somewhere else to live, Gonzalez smiled sweetly. I just want our family to be safe, he said, hiding behind my parents backs as he mouthed goodbye. Fine. If they wanted me to stop protecting them from Hurricane Gonzalez, I'd wish them good luck. The day after I moved out, Gonzalez decided to upgrade the house's electrical system. Every light in the neighborhood now flickered in rhythm with our toaster when mom tried to make toast. It activated the garage door, the ceiling fans and somehow started Dad's car. The power company had to shut down our entire grid and rewire our house. Bill was $3,000. It's synchronized living, Gonzales explained proudly to the electrician. Next he discovered online chemistry tutorials without me secretly replacing his chemicals with baking soda, he created what he called rainbow smoke bombs in the kitchen. But they were actually just straight up acid that ate through the tiles and corrupted all the food. Hazmat Had to gut our kitchen entirely. Total cost, $8,000. Why didn't you tell us this would happen? Mom yelled at me through the phone. I did. You just never listened, I reminded her. Then Gonzales revealed he'd been training squirrels in the attic. They're my army, he explained, as 20 squirrels wearing tiny tin foil hats and it through the ceiling during Dad's Zoom meeting with his boss. Dad got fired on the spot. Then came the car improvement incident. Gonzalez filled Dad's gas tank with what he called super juice, a mixture of energy drinks, lighter fluid and glitter. The car made it exactly.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We'd known each other since freshman year. And when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything, 50 50, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird serious face she starts with. So I've been thinking and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. But she's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue because honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I tell her, fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realize I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says, okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the TV and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realized she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that really made me laugh. When I was packing up the kitchen stuff, I realized I'd bought all the cooking supplies, too, the pans, the good knife set, even the can opener. I left her with basically nothing except a mini fridge and some random cups she had from high school. By the time I finished loading everything, the apartment looked like nobody had ever lived there. Just empty rooms with.

So I gave my daughter a name she'll never forget. I've been planning to name my daughter Sophia Rose since I was literally 14 years old. I had this whole Pinterest board with nursery ideas, wrote it in my diary about a million times, even practice signing birthday cards with love, Sophia's mom like a complete weirdo. When I got pregnant at 23, everyone in my family knew this was the name. I been talking about it for almost 10 years. But my younger sister Emma always had to make everything about her growing up. If I got a new bike, she needed a better one. If I made honor roll, she suddenly cared about grades. When I announced I was pregnant, she immediately started trying to get pregnant too, even though she'd been with her boyfriend Tyler for only like 8 months and could barely afford rent on her studio apartment. Two months after my announcement, she called me crying happy tears. I'm pregnant too. We can be pregnant together. At first I was excited, sister. Pregnancy sounded cute. We could share maternity clothes, compare weird cravings, complain about swollen feet together. But then she started copying everything I mentioned, craving pickles and ice cream. Suddenly that was her thing too. I bought this gorgeous cream colored crib from target. She showed up with the exact same one three days later when I posted bump photos in my Favorite blue maternity dress. She bought the same dress in pink and posted almost identical pics. The worst part was she kept asking about names. What are you thinking for names? I'm so stuck. You always have the best ideas. I stupidly told her about Sophia Rose because I trusted her. She nodded along, said it was beautiful, even suggested middle name alternatives. At 36 weeks, she went into early labor. I was still two weeks away from my due date, feeling like a whale and scared something was wrong. She texted me from the hospital, she's here, 7 pounds, 2 ounces of perfect. Come meet your niece. I waddled into that hospital room with flowers and a pink teddy bear, so excited to meet my first niece. Emma was glowing in her hospital bed holding this tiny, perfect baby girl. Meet Sophia Rose, she said with the biggest smile. I literally felt my heart stop. What did you just say? Sophia Rose. Tyler, she repeated, like nothing was wrong. Isn't she perfect? The name just felt so right when I saw her little face. You, you were right. It's such a beautiful name. I stood there holding wilted flowers, 38 weeks pregnant with my own daughter, watching my sister cuddle the baby who now had my name, the name I'd planned for almost a decade. Tyler was taking pictures. The nurses were cooing, and I felt like I was watching my dreams get stolen in real time. Emma, that Was my name, I whispered. She looked at me with fake confusion.

Everyone knew Gabby was more than just our big sister. She became our mom the day ours died. When she was 18, Gabby taught my brother how to shave, stayed up all night when my youngest sister had nightmares, and somehow made four teenagers feel safe in a world that had just collapsed. Last Thanksgiving changed everything forever. Gabby had been trying to have a baby for three years. At 38, her doctor said IVF was her only shot, but insurance wouldn't cover it at $15,000 per round. She called a family meeting after Sunday dinner, her hands shaking as she explained, I've never asked you guys for anything, but I need help. I know it's a lot of money. We all said we'd figure it out together. Everyone hugged her that night. Liam said, of course we'll help. You deserve this. Becca literally cried, saying, always wanted to be an aunt. Kelsey promised to set up a payment plan for all of us. Gabby was glowing. This was her dream. She booked the appointment for next month, texting us, they need the deposit. Tuesday at three PM we can all meet there. Everyone responded with thumbs up and heart emojis. He started a spreadsheet showing how if each of us contributed $3,000, she could start treatment next month. She sent us IVF success stories and potential baby names, even asked Becca to be her birth partner. But Then Liam bought a new BMW. That week, Becca booked a month long Europe trip with her husband. Kelsey renovated her entire kitchen. Gabby saw everything but stayed quiet. Tuesday came. I got to the clinic at 2:45 with $2,000 all I could scrape together. Gabby was already there, dressed up, smiling while clutching her purse. They're coming right, she kept asking. Three PM past three thirty four PM, she kept calling. No answer. The clinic closed. I held her hand as she had to cancel the appointment. Liam texted the group chat first. Can't swing it right now. Tight month. Becca, same. Sorry. Kelsey just sent a sad face emoji. Gabby replied, I understand and nothing. Later that night, I found her on the floor sobbing in the nursery she'd already started decorating, holding the baby clothes she bought on sale. She didn't know I could see her from the hallway as she saw into a tiny yellow onesie that said worth the wait. I held her as she shook. I really thought they'd come, she whispered. Two months later at Mom's death anniversary dinner, Gabby brought it up one last time. She we found a clinic that offered payment plans and only needed $2,000 from each of us to start. I'm running out of time, she said quietly. Please. I've never asked for anything else. Becca laughed. Gabby, maybe motherhood just isn't meant for you. I mean, you've never even been married. Liam nodded, yeah, and you already Raised us. Isn't that enough for you? Kelsey added, it's kind of selfish to bring a kid into the world alone at your age. Gabby's face went completely blank. She slowly looked at each of us. Fish, Gabby whispered. Then louder. Selfish. She stood up and walked to her bedroom, returning with a large photo album I'd never seen before. She started pulling out birthday cards, dozens of them, spreading them across the table. Liam, your 18th birthday. Read what you wrote. Liam's face reddened as Gabby read it aloud.

My sister died when my niece Chloe was 12 and her dad basically disappeared after that. So Chloe moved in with me and my husband. He was this quiet kid who barely talked for the first year, which honestly broke my heart because my sister was the loudest person alive. By the time Chloe turned 15, she started opening up more. She tell me about school, drama, boys she thought were cute, normal teenage stuff. But then junior year, she started acting different. She get weird when her friends talked about guys and she stopped mentioning crushes all together. I figured she was just focusing on school. One night she was helping me make dinner when she goes, Aunt Jamie, what would you do if someone in our family was gay? I'm stirring pasta sauce trying to act casual and I said something like, love them the exact same way I always have. She got quiet after that. A few weeks later, she brought home this girl named Alex for a study session, except they weren't studying anything. They were sitting way too close on the couch sharing earbuds and Chloe was laughing more than I'd seen in years. When Alex left, Chloe had this dopey smile that gave everything away. I didn't say anything because I wanted her to tell me when she was ready. But then my mom called last month asking if Chloe Was dating anyone. My mom's old school Catholic, the type who still thinks being gay is a choice and that prayer can fix everything. She started going on about how she couldn't wait for Chloe to find a nice boy and settle down. That's when I realized the problem. See, my sister left Chloe a pretty big inheritance that she gets when she turns 18. But there's a catch. My mom controls it until then. And knowing my mom, if she found out Chloe was gay, she'd probably find some way to mess with that money or make Chloe's life hell. So when Chloe finally came out to me last week, I was in my kitchen at midnight, scared I'd kick her out. I hugged her tight and told her I was proud of her. But then I said, listen, you need to keep this between us for now. Your grandma can't know until you get your inheritance. She looked confused. So I explained the whole situation, how grandma still thinks gay people are going to hell, how she controls the money, how we only have to wait six more months until Chloe turns 18. Chloe got upset and said she was tired of hiding who she was. I, I told her I wasn't asking her to hide forever, just to be smart about it. Bring Alex over whenever you want, I said. Be yourselves here, but around grandma maybe. Don't mention the girlfriend part yet. She called me a Coward and locked herself in her room for two days. My husband thinks I'm wrong, too, says we shouldn't let my mom's bigotry control our choices. I've seen how nasty my mom can get when she disapproves of something. She cut off my cousin for getting pregnant at 19 and didn't speak to him for three years. Six months feels like forever when you're 17 and in love. But that inheritance could pay for Chloe's college, maybe help her buy a house someday. It's her mom's money, money my sister saved specifically for Chloe's future.

So when Chloe finally came out to me last week, I was in my kitchen at midnight, scared I'd kick her out. I hugged her tight and told her I was proud of her. But then I said, listen, you need to keep this between us for now. Your grandma can't know until you get your inheritance. She looked confused. So I explained the whole situation, how grandma still thinks gay people are going to hell, how she controls the money, how we only have to wait six more months until Chloe turns 18. Chloe got upset and said she was tired of hiding who she was. I, I told her I wasn't asking her to hide forever, just to be smart about it. Bring Alex over whenever you want, I said. Be yourselves here, but around grandma maybe. Don't mention the girlfriend part yet. She called me a Coward and locked herself in her room for two days. My husband thinks I'm wrong, too, says we shouldn't let my mom's bigotry control our choices. I've seen how nasty my mom can get when she disapproves of something. She cut off my cousin for getting pregnant at 19 and didn't speak to him for three years. Six months feels like forever when you're 17 and in love. But that inheritance could pay for Chloe's college, maybe help her buy a house someday. It's her mom's money, money my sister saved specifically for Chloe's future.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We'd known each other since freshman year. And when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything, 50 50, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird serious face she starts with. So I've been thinking and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. But she's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue because honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I tell her, fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realize I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says, okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the TV and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realised she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that really made me laugh. When I was packing up the kitchen stuff, I realised I'd bought all the cooking supplies too, the pans, the good knife set, even the can opener. I left her with basically nothing except a mini fridge and some random cups she had from high school. By the time I finished loading everything, the apartment looked like nobody had ever lived there, just empty rooms with some random junk scattered around that wasn't worth taking. I drive to my new place. Feeling pretty good about myself. I'm unpacking when my phone starts blowing up. First it's texts, then calls. Megan is absolutely losing it. What the hell did you do to the apartment? She screams. When I finally pick up, it's completely empty. I tell her calmly that I took everything I paid for, just like I said I would. She she starts yelling about how she looks like an idiot because her friends were supposed to come over that night and now there's nowhere to sit and nothing to watch. You can't just take everything, she says. How am I supposed to explain this? I remind her that she literally said okay when I told her I was taking my stuff. She hangs up on me.

It worked. My sister Ava was off limits. That wasn't a discussion. It was law in our house. According to dad, when she turned 13, she already had boys from school calling our house and he'd answer with, she's not available until she's 30. My brother Tom and I fell in line naturally. We'd been through the teenage guy phase ourselves, so we knew exactly what went through their heads. When Ava started high school, we all watched her like Hawks. We'd always make sure no guys were bothering her at school. Dad kept a baseball bat by the front door for emergencies for whenever Ava mentioned a boy's name. We weren't crazy, just protective. When Ava was 15, some senior asked her to prom. The three of us dropped her off at his house at ten PM just to introduce ourselves. He ended up staying home that night. Ava cried for a week, but we told her we were just keeping her safe. Then out of nowhere, she had a boyfriend, Jackson. Ava brought him home for Thanksgiving. She gave us exactly 12 hours notice, probably hoping we wouldn't have time to prepare. She was wrong. When Jackson arrived, he was everything we expected, clean cut, nervous, kept calling dad sir out of respect. We circled him like sharks. Tom crushed his hand during the handshake, holding on three seconds too long. I asked him about his intentions while flipping a kitchen knife between my fingers. Dad just sat there silent, occasionally glancing at the baseball bat. Jackson stuttered through dinner, dropped his fork twice. This one would break easy. But then something shifted. By dessert, Jackson had stopped stuttering. When Tom made another comment about protecting what's ours, Jackson just nodded and said, I'd expect nothing less. She's lucky to have you all. When I tried to corner him about his career prospects, he calmly explained his five year plan, then asked about mine. Even Dad's silence didn't rattle him anymore. He just sat there occasionally touching Ava's hand under the table like we weren't three large men plotting his demise. Tell dad didn't like this at all. Who did this kid think he was? We talked in the garage while Ava showed him her old room. He's not scared yet. We need to do more. For three days, we made Jackson's life hell. Tom would accidentally wake him up at 5 a. M. With his workout music, took him on a hiking trip that was basically a death march through the woods, hoping he'd tap out. Dad made him help rebuild the deck in freezing weather, giving him the wrong tools on purpose. But Jackson just kept showing up, kept smiling, kept holding Ava's hand. By day four, we were furious. On his last night, Ava ran to the store for ice cream, leaving Jackson alone with us. This was It. We all walked up to him, surrounding his chair. Tom cracked his knuckles. I crossed my arms. Dad loomed over him, all 6 foot 3 of angry father. We could tell he was nervous. Finally, a real reaction. We stared him down, hoping he'd crack. But then Jackson did something none of us expected. He stood up slowly, looked dad straight in the eye, reached out.

My brother Jake was getting married to this girl who seemed super sweet at first. She was all smiles and hugs whenever I was around. But when it came time to pick bridesmaid dresses, her true colors started showing. She wanted everyone to wear this specific coral pink dress that cost $800, not including alterations. I'm a college student working part time at a coffee shop, making barely enough to cover my rent and ramen noodles. $800 might as well have been 8,000. I politely told her I couldn't afford it and asked if there was maybe a cheaper option or if I could get something similar in the same color. She literally laughed at me and said if I couldn't afford to be in her wedding, maybe I shouldn't be in it at all. But then she quickly backtracked when she realized how that sounded and suggested I could just borrow money from my parents. Here's the thing, my parents died in a car accident when I was 17. Jake knew this. His fiance knew this. I've been on my own since then, working my way through school with student loans and whatever jobs I could find. I explained my situation again, thinking maybe she forgot. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic and that everyone has to make sacrifices for weddings. Then she suggested I could sell some of my stuff or pick up Extra shifts to make it happen. I was already working 30 hours a week on top of full time classes. I had nothing left to sell except my laptop, which I needed for school and my car, which I needed to get to work. The whole thing made me feel like absolute garbage. Jake wasn't much better. When I went to him for help, he said his fiance was just stressed about wedding planning and that I should try to understand. He offered to lend me the money, but I'd have to pay him back within six months with interest because they were saving for a house. Interest from my own brother, for a dress I'd wear once to watch him marry someone who clearly thought I was beneath her. That's when I realised this wasn't really about the money. It was about respect. She could have easily picked a less expensive dress or worked with everyone's budgets. Instead, she chose to make it a test of who really wanted to be there for her special day. I told Jake I couldn't make it work and wouldn't be in the wedding party. He got angry and said I was being selfish and trying to ruin his big day. His fiance jumped in and said she wasn't surprised because I'd always been jealous of their relationship and was probably looking for an excuse to cause drama. The whole thing blew up. Jake said if I couldn't support him as a bridesmaid. Then maybe I shouldn't come at all. I said fine, and didn't go to the wedding. I spent that Saturday working a double shift at the coffee shop, making the money I would have blown on a dress I'd never wear again.

I'll never forget seeing the new kid, Ben, sitting alone at his desk at Tuesday morning, tears streaming down his face, while the entire their class erupted in laughter around him. He was almost completely deaf and had been an easy target every single day since he transferred to our school. A few guys stood behind him, their mouths moving in exaggerated yells that Ben couldn't hear. Making obscene gestures and mimic king sign language, while Ben just saw everyone laughing at him and pointing. Gabe would take it to the next level, as he'd go as far as to scream right behind him, knowing he wouldn't react. The math teacher had stepped out to make copies, and in those five minutes, they'd already reduced Ben to tears. His eyes darted around the room, desperately trying to understand what was so funny, what he'd done wrong this time. But he just couldn't understand. I tried to help him, but every attempt just made things worse for both of us. When I stood up and told them to stop in lunch last week, he just laughed and said I had a crush on the stupid deaf kid. Which became another joke that followed me through the halls. At least three or four incidents every single day, always when teachers weren't looking. Always calculated to make Ben feel the biggest loser in our whole school. I reported it to the principal twice. But she just said, boys will be boys, and that Ben needed to learn to stand up for himself. How could he stand up to harassment he couldn't even hear? Gabe was a literal monster, but I had no idea how far he was about to go. I made one last attempt to handle this the right way by going directly to the guidance counselor with my documented evidence. I showed him three weeks of detailed notes explaining how the bullying was escalating, how Ben had started eating lunch in the bathroom, how his grades were dropping because he was too anxious to focus in class. I told her all about how Gabe had been harassing him daily, making his life a living hell. She looked at my notebook side and said that I should focus on my own education. I thought she was joking at first, but then I realized the guidance counselor was friends with Gabe's mom, and I knew she didn't believe any of it. Ben needs to learn to communicate better with his peers. Communicate better? How the hell was he supposed to communicate with people he couldn't even hear? I was about to say that, but then a loud ringing sound went off in my ear. The fire alarm started blaring right next to me, and everyone filed out in the usual chaos of an unexpected drill. I was already outside when I noticed those same guys huddled together, laughing nervously but trying to play It cool. They were talking about something, but I had too much on my mind to listen. The building was actually smoking. I'd never seen this before, because this wasn't actually a drill. We all stood outside watching it. When I heard one of them say, yo, we should probably tell someone now. I was listening. Gabe told them to be quiet, but another guy said, guys, we can't just leave him there. That fire is huge. I knew who him was immediately. I asked what they meant. Gabe had tears in his eyes. Ben still in there? We left him as a joke because he couldn't hear the alarm. The building was now engulfed in flames, windows shattering from the heat.

Why, it's in the corner of your room. I gestured toward the small medical waste bin while cradling the Newborn, who was struggling to breathe. Go ahead and toss it for me, please. She said it so casually, like she was asking me to throw away a tissue. What? Ma'am, this is your baby. I held the infant closer to my chest protectively. Look at it. The little turd is hardly alive. He can barely breathe. Just do us all a favor and throw it out. Her pupils were dilated and she kept scratching at her arms. Absolute not. I turned away from her and started checking the baby's vitals. I'd seen the track marks on her arms during delivery. The baby was born premature and underweight, with clear signs of neonatal abstinence syndrome. His little body was already going through withdrawal from whatever substances his mother had been using during pregnancy. He needed immediate medical intervention, not a trash can. The mother started getting agitated when I didn't comply. She sat up in the bed, despite having just given birth 20 minutes ago. Her hospital gown was soaked with sweat and blood, but she didn't seem to notice or care. The way she looked at her own child like he was garbage made my stomach turn. I knew I had to get this baby to the NICU immediately. His breathing was shallow and his skin had A bluish tint that worried me. Every second counted. But I also couldn't just walk out without following protocol. I needed to document everything and alert social services about the mother's request to dispose of her child. I'm going to take your son for treatment now. He needs oxygen and monitoring. I kept my voice calm and professional. The mother's eyes narrowed. She looked around the room like she was calculating something. Then her whole demeanor changed. Her face contorted into fake panic, and she started screaming at the top of her lungs. Help me! This woman is trying to hurt my baby! Her voice echoed down the hospital corridor. Within seconds, three other doctors rushed into the room. Doctor the Peters and Doctor Burton looked between me and the screaming mother, trying to assess the situation. Behind them, Nurse Melendez appeared, looking concerned. They all knew me, but they also had to respond to a mother's distress call about her Newborn. Put the baby down and return it to the mother. Doctor Peters used his authority voice. No! I'm trying to save this baby's life! She asked me to throw him in the trash can. She's not in a state to care for him. I held the infant tighter. The mother's performance escalated. Tears streamed down her face as she reached toward me with shaking hands. She's insane. Why would anyone want to throw out their baby? I looked desperately at my colleagues. They had to see through this. Act. The baby in my arms was barely breathing and needed immediate care. His mother was clearly high and had just asked me to dispose of him like medical waste. But the other doctors were looking at me strangely. Doctor de Burton stepped closer with his hands up, like he was approaching a dangerous animal. Gabriella, did you take your medication today? When we hired you, you promised to never miss a day of your medication. My heart sank. They thought I was having an episode. Five years ago, I'd had a brief mental health crisis. During my residency, I've been properly diagnosed and treated for bipolar disorder. I've been stable on medication ever since. But that history would always follow me. Now this manipulative woman was using it against me. I never

So we're three months from the wedding, and I make the mistake of telling my family we finally booked our venue. A big mistake. My mother in law immediately goes into interrogation mode.

I do a quick Google and show them someone did this already in 2,015. First dance under the golden arches, I say wistfully.

Ronald McDonald is officiating. I add we're registered at McDonald's for gift cards. My mother in law looks at me with pure betrayal.

I pull out the fake McDonald's catering menu I made at 3:00am. Too late. We customized our Mcflurry Bar. Oreo for my side, M&M for his. She grips the door frame.

They called it Operation Real Venue with Slide 7 titled signs they've lost their Minds. Week two, my aunt calls crying that she can't tell her book club my knee.

My best friend asked me to quit my 180,000 dollar V P. Position to watch her kids because daycare is for people who don't have friends with maternal instincts and she could not miss her wine tasting certification course. Madison told me for years that I was meant to be a stay at home mom and a natural mother while dumping her children at my door every single day. Madison and I met at our first corporate jobs, where we both swore we'd be C E O s by 30. Then I had twins at 28 and everything changed for me overnight, while Madison kept climbing that ladder until she married a cardiac surgeon and retired at 20 9 to live her best life. The morning I told her I was leaving work to raise my kids, she hugged me and whispered, you're going to be such an amazing mother because you actually have those maternal instincts, unlike women like me who need more stimulation. When my husband got laid off and money got tight, she was the first to say staying home was still the right choice since I was so naturally nurturing and some women were just meant to be mothers. By the time my twins were two and I had my third baby, Madison had her first kid with her surgeon husband. Three weeks postpartum, she showed up at my door at six In the morning with her Newborn still covered in spit up, and announced, why would I pay strangers when my best friend is literally the best mother I know? Before I could answer, she was already backing out of my driveway in her new Range Rover, leaving her screaming baby in my arms while texting her personal trainer. Every morning became a hostage situation where Madison would ring my doorbell before dawn with her daughter and whatever emergency made it impossible for her to parent that day, from Pilates to brunches to urgent manicures that couldn't be rescheduled. When I suggested the elite daycare that her husband could definitely afford, she laughed and said, those places are where lazy parents abandon their children. But I have you. Why would I traumatize my baby with strangers? When Madison had her second baby, she didn't even pretend to consider childcare. You're literally glowing when you're surrounded by all these babies while I just feel trapped. So really, I'm doing you a favor by giving you more purpose in life. She dropped both kids with ear infections and stomach bugs while she attended charity luncheons where she'd complain about how exhausting motherhood was to women who actually watched their own children. She sent me midnight texts saying she needed me to take the kids for three days because her husband was at a medical conference and she absolutely had to join him, which I'd later see on Instagram was her at a Miami Spa resort while he worked while she posted champagne selfies. I was managing five kids through stomach flu and when I texted that her son had a fever of 103, she replied with a thumbs up emoji and asked if I could handle the weekend too since she booked a couple's massage. She threw elaborate birthday parties, taking credit for the Pinterest perfect decorations while telling other moms blessed she was to be so hands on even though I was doing everything while she got Botox. For six years, this was my life. While Madison remodeled her third house and posted about the struggles of being a stay at home mom. Her village that made it all possible, as she said in her posts, was literally just me watching her kids for free, including Christmas morning when she flew to Aspen because she desperately needed a break from the holidays. Everything shifted when my youngest started kindergarten and I had seven hours of freedom every weekday for the first time in six years. I updated my resume and started interviewing while Madison acted like I'd personally betrayed her by even suggesting I might want something beyond her childcare.

I smiled. I haven't heard of that one. Her words slurred from the laughing gas. It's when I hear daddy's car and everyone freezes like statues. My hygienist, Sierra, raised an eyebrow. That sounds interesting. How do you play? When we hear the garage, Mommy says statue time and we all freeze wherever we are, Isabella explained drowsily. Even if I'm eating or playing, everything stops. That's when I noticed the faint yellow marks on her upper arm, mostly hidden by her sleeve. Sometimes I'm really good at it. Last week I held my spoon in the air for 20 whole minutes. She seemed proud. Mommy said I was the best statue ever. Twenty minutes is a long time, I said, gently adjusting her sleeve to see better. Fingerprint bruises? Old ones. Can you raise your arm for me, sweetie? I need to adjust the chair. As she raised both arms, her shirt rode up. Linear marks crossed her lower back, some scarred, some fresh. What happens if someone moves during statue time? I kept working, acting like I was just doing my job. That's losing. Daddy doesn't like when we lose. Excuse myself to get a different tool, stepping to my computer to pull up our mandatory reporting protocols. When I returned, I asked casually, and if you win the statue game? If we're all good statues, daddy, Walks through and goes to his room. Then we can breathe normal again. Sometimes he even says good job and we get to eat dinner. You get to eat dinner? Only if we win. Losers don't deserve dinner. But mommy sneaks me crackers later. I made a show of checking Isabella's chart while secretly measuring the bruise patterns with my pen light. 3 2 cm spread on the grip marks. Adult male hand size. Isabella, what other games does your family play? I asked oceaning my hygiene to discreetly check on the father. The listening game, where he asks questions and we have to answer exactly right. I pulled out my light open wide again. What kind of questions? Like who's the most important person in this house? The answer is always daddy. The light revealed slight scarring on her inner cheek, likely from biting during stress. Happens when someone gets the answer wrong. Sometimes no breakfast or lunch. My tummy hurts so bad, but crying makes it worse. My least favourite one is the quiet room. I set down my tools. Tell me about this quiet room. While I set up this X ray. I positioned the lead apron, noting how she winced when I touched her shoulders. It's the closet under the stairs. No light. We stay until we're sorry enough. I count to know how long I lasted. My record is 10,000 seconds. What's yours? The excitement in her voice broke my heart. That was over two And a half hours. That's a lot of counting, Sierra returned, mouthing her dad's asking how much longer you'll be. Mommy went in there last week, Isabella continued. He had to fold up real small cause she's bigger. Daddy said she forgot who pays the bills. Sometimes I hear her crying in there, but I can't help or I go in too. We Learned that rule the hard way. I took the X rays, handed her some stickers, and said, I need to develop these. Sierra will stay with you in the hallway. I called CPS from my cell. Active abuse case. Child has physical marks. Describes systematic torture disguised as games. Father is in waiting room. Returning, I pretended to review her chart. Isabella, has anyone else seen you play these games? No, silly. It's a family secret.

Amelia threw herself onto her bed, still wearing the clothes I'd caught her in when she climbed back through her bedroom window at 2:00am. Two weeks grounded. Are you actually serious right now? She grabbed a pillow and screamed into it. I was just at Tyler's party. Everyone was there. Everyone except you because you weren't allowed to go. I. I stood in her doorway, exhausted from waiting up. You snuck out. That's the issue. She sat up, mascara smeared under her eyes. Sadie's mom would never do this. She literally called the school last week and lied about Sadie being sick. When she skipped, Amelia kicked off her shoes. She trusts Sadie to make her own choices. She doesn't treat her like a prisoner. That's not trust, Amelia. That. That's being a cool mom who actually has her daughter's back. She stood up, fists clenched. All I want is a mom who covers for me sometimes instead of punishing me for being a normal teenager. Why can't you be like her? That night, I couldn't sleep. Amelia's words kept echoing in my head. Maybe I was too strict. Maybe kids did need freedom to figure things out. Her dad had been the lenient one before the divorce and she'd always loved him more. Was I pushing her away? The next morning, I knocked on her door. School today, if you want, I'll Call you in sick. Amelia's jaw dropped. Wait, what? You said you wanted me to have your back, so I'm having your back. She skipped three days that week. I called the attendance office, each time faking a cough. Amelia has the flu. Friday night she stumbled home at 1:00am, clearly drunk. The old me would have lectured her until sunrise. Instead, I helped her to bed, left water and Advil on her nightstand. I mumbled, thanks, mom, before passing out. I'd lay awake terrified, but kept repeating what I read online. Teenagers need autonomy. Natural consequences teach better than punishment. The lies got easier. Amelia would text she was at the library, but her Instagram showed her at the mall. I'd see beer cans in her backpack and pretend not to notice natural consequences. I reminded myself she'll learn on her own. Amelia started coming home with hickeys, peoples dilated, smelling like weed. Her sweet friends stopped coming around. Now it was kids with tattoos and vape pens who never came inside, just honked from the driveway at midnight. But Amelia seemed thrilled with the new me. She kissed my cheek randomly, bragged to friends on the phone about how chill I was. My mom literally doesn't care what I do, I heard her say proudly. Those words should have been my wake up call. Instead, I smiled, thinking I'd finally gotten parenting right. Thursday night, Amelia texted at ten PM, sleeping over at Sadie's to study for bio Test. Her dad called immediately, voice tight with concern. School night sleepovers. Since when I kept my voice casual. She needs freedom. Remember, I already said yes. But at eleven PM, Sadie's mom called. Is Sadie at your house? She said she was studying with Amelia. My stomach dropped, but I heard myself lying. No, haven't seen her. Maybe they went to another friends. I hung up knowing both girls were lying. But I committed to this path. At 1:00am, Amelia texted again. Actually at a party staying with a friend from school. Her dad was at my door in 10 minutes demanding we get her. She's being honest with us now. We have to trust her. God, I was an idiot. At 3 a. M, my phone rang. Amelia's voice was tiny, terrified. Mom, please come get me. Please. She was sobbing so hard she could barely speak. I'm at this college party. These guys said they were seniors, but they're like 25. One won't let me leave his room. He keeps giving me drinks. I locked myself in the bathroom when he tried to. Her voice broke. Mom, I'm scared. I flew out the door speeding.

We had the weirdest rule in probably the entire state. No closed doors while changing clothes, ever. Not my bedroom door, not the bathroom, not even the closet. Teenagers hide tattoos all over their body if we let them, dad would say. Or they could be hiding pills in their pockets. My friends were horrified when they heard about it. Mickey came over once and watched me change from school clothes to normal ones right in the middle of our living room while dad sat there with his newspaper, glancing up every few seconds. That's so creepy, she whispered, and I wanted to disappear. My older brother had already escaped to college, partly because of rules like this. I counted days until I could leave, too. Mom tried to help without directly challenging dad. She couldn't change his mind about the rule, but she found ways around it. The shower has frosted glass, I mentioned one day while folding towels. You're only visible as a shadow. She also helped me rearrange my room, putting my full length mirror at an angle where it looked like you could see everything from the doorway, but there was actually a blind spot. Perfect for 30 second wardrobe changes. I got really good at it, too. I kept spare clothes in the bathroom and changed when dad was busy watching TV. Mom would create distractions, calling dad to fix something right when I Needed to change for school. For weeks, this worked perfectly. Dad thought he was enforcing his rules since doors stayed open. He even bragged to his co workers about how his visibility system kept me safe. But then one weekend, everything exploded. And ways I never imagined. Dad's colleague Rob came by to drop off work files. Dad was on a video call in his office. Mom was grocery shopping, and I just gotten home from track with my entire body sweating. I couldn't wait for Dad's call to end, so I ducked behind my mirror. Blind spot, like always. But Rob didn't know our house layout. He was looking for Dad's office and saw what looked completely wrong from his angle. A teenage girl hiding behind furniture to undress. He looked away immediately, but asked me a question that sounded oddly serious. Where's your father? I pointed to Dad's office, and he took off through the door. I heard him say, Jim, your daughter was hiding behind furniture to change clothes. Combined with these visibility rules you mentioned. Dad came out confused at first. She knows the rules about doors. Rob shook his head. Jim, she was hiding behind furniture to change. That is not okay. You're making her feel unsafe. The way he said it made Dad's face go pale from realization. By the next morning, everything was chaos. Rob, being a mandated reporter, had called CPS overnight. Two social workers showed up before breakfast asking to speak With me. Privately, they separated us into different rooms. Dad in the kitchen, me in the living room, mom in the bedroom. Can you explain the rules about changing clothes in your house? The woman asked gently. I'm just not allowed to close doors, I said. Not even while changing clothes? She wrote something down. So you felt the need to hide behind furniture because your dad doesn't give you privacy? I tried explaining the mirror trick, but it sounded worse out loud. So you developed evasion strategies to change clothes. She kept on writing in her notepad. Then they brought dad in. Sir, can you explain why your daughter cannot have privacy while changing? Dad's voice shook. It's just not closing doors for her safety. Kids hide all kinds of stuff. It's her body, the woman finished. And you think watching her prevents her from what? Being a delinquent? Dad nodded frantically. You require visual confirmation of your 16 year old

I was dating this guy Mark for about six months when he finally introduced me to his 8 year old daughter Emma. He'd always made excuses about why I couldn't meet her. She was shy, going through a phase staying with grandparents. Red flags I ignored because I was falling for him. The first time I went to his house, Emma answered the door. She was this tiny, timid little thing who immediately apologized for existing. Sorry, sorry. I'll get daddy. Sorry for bothering you. Mark came to the door and didn't even acknowledge her. No hug, no how was your day? Nothing. She just disappeared upstairs like a ghost. During dinner, Emma asked quietly if she could have some ketchup. Mark exploded. You always want something. Can't you just eat normal food like a normal kid? This is why your mother left. I watched this little girl's face crumble. She whispered, sorry, daddy, and ate her plain chicken in silence while tears rolled down her cheeks. I tried to lighten the mood, asking Emma about school. Mark cut me off. She's not good at talking to people. Emma, go to your room. Adults are trying to have a conversation. She vanished again. I didn't see her the rest of the night. Over the next few weeks, I started noticing a pattern. Emma would try to exist quietly, but Mark treated her like an inconvenience he was stuck with. One day I came over. Early and heard him screaming at her upstairs, just like your worthless mother, nothing but problems. I found Emma sobbing in her room, which was basically a storage closet with a mattress on the floor. No decorations, no toys, no signs a child lived there. The breaking point came during Emma's birthday. Mark forgot completely. When I reminded him, he got annoyed and said birthdays are just made up holidays to make kids feel special. She needs to learn the world doesn't revolve around her. I couldn't take it anymore. I secretly bought Emma a small cake and a stuffed animal. When I gave them to her, she started crying and hugging the toy like it was the most precious thing in the world. Nobody ever gave me a present before, she whispered. Daddy says presents make kids spoiled. That night, Mark found the gifts and flew into a rage. He threw the stuffed animal in the trash and screamed at Emma for manipulating me into feeling sorry for her. She's got you fooled. She puts on this act to get attention. Her mother did the same thing, played victim until she got what she wanted. I watched him destroy this little girl's only source of joy while she stood there taking it like she deserved it. That's when I realised Mark wasn't just a bad parent. He was systematically breaking his daughter's spirit. The next day while Mark was at work, I went back to see Emma. She was Home alone. Apparently, he'd been leaving her by herself since she was 6. I sat down with her and said, Emma, you know none of this is your fault, right? You deserve love and kindness and presents on your birthday. She looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language. But daddy says I'm bad. Daddy says Mommy left because I cried too much as a baby. My heart shattered. This man had convinced his daughter that her own mother abandoned her because she was defective. That evening when Mark came home, I confronted him. I told him I'd seen enough and that how he treated Emma was emotional abuse. He laughed in my face. You don't know anything about parenting. Emma needs discipline, not cuddling. Her mother turned her into a weak, needy brat. I looked him dead in the eye and said, you're right. I don't know about parenting, but I know about basic human decency. Then I called Child Protective Services right in front of him. He went ballistic, screaming that I was destroying his family, that Emma would end up in foster care because of me. But Emma ran to me and hugged my leg.

I was working at a phone shop when this mom stormed in with her 15 year old daughter, demanding I fix her iPhone that broke for no reason. The girls yelling at me about how I sold her a piece of junk and wants a full refund on a phone she bought four months ago. Mom's backing her up, saying her responsible daughter always uses a case and this is clearly a defect product. I take the phone to examine it. The screen is completely shattered, there's sand in the charging port, and it smells like chlorine. This has water damage and impact damage. I explained. The warranty doesn't cover dropping it in a pool. Girl loses it. I never dropped it. It just stopped working. Mom demands my manager immediately. He's at lunch, I said. But I can call the district manager if you want. The daughter smirks at her mom. B there's scared. They know they're wrong. Mom pulls out her credit card. Just give us a new phone and we'll dispute the charge later. I shake my head. Ma'am, I can't exchange a phone that's been damaged by the customer. Customer? The girl laughs. More like victim of false advertising. She starts loudly complaining to other customers in the door. Don't buy anything here. They sell broken phones. The mom joins in. This is going straight to corporate. What's your name? I point to my name tag. It's right There! Well, you just cost yourself a job. The mom says, my husband's a lawyer. The daughter's getting older. Yeah, and my dad's gonna sue this whole company! She grabs the broken phone from my hands. This is evidence of your defective products! I try to stay calm. Please don't handle the device. Sharp glass could cut you. Don't tell me what to do! She snaps. You work retail! I'm the customer! The mom nods. Exactly. The customer is always right. Not when they're lying, I said quietly. The girl gasps dramatically. He just called me a liar, mom! Did you hear that? Mom's face turns red. I want your manager now! Call him back from lunch! And I want a new phone plus compensation for emotional distress! The daughter adds she's waving the broken phone around. This thing could have exploded and killed me! I notice other customers starting to stare. The mom notices too and speaks louder. This employee is harassing my daughter and refusing to honor your warranty! The daughter feels bold. I just wanted my phone fixed and he's being so mean to me! The mom hugs her. It's okay, sweetie. We'll get this resolved. She turns to me with fury in her eyes. You've made my daughter cry. I hope you're proud. I'm calling corporate right now. She continues dialing on her phone. The daughter whispers something to her mom, who nods and hangs up. Actually, we're going straight to the news. This is a Story they need to hear. The girl notices my own damaged phone on the counter. What's

Emma had this habit of saying random things loudly at the worst possible moments, but this was next level embarrassing. Ma, honey, let's go play on the slides, I whispered, trying to drag her away from the wedding party, but she wasn't having it. She broke free from my grip and marched right up to the bride, tugging on her dress. Lady, don't marry the mean man, Emma said, pointing directly at the groom. He's gonna hurt you. Everyone went dead silent. The groom's face went red and he started walking toward us looking angry. Hey, what kind of kid says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just 3 and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve. My mommy had marks like that when the bad man lived with us. She cried at night, too, just like you smell like tears under your makeup. My heart stopped. This kid had been through way too much for her age, but she developed this Weird ability to spot things adults tried to hide. When my ex was still around, Emma would always know when I've been crying, even if I thought I'd covered it up perfectly.

Mom's eating breakfast scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading Life 3, 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work hard time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest, she says. If we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear, which sounds like something a dictator would say. But whatever. She makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realize immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3, 60 doesn't just show where you are, it shows your speed when driving, your phone battery and sends notification for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect. Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says, no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is, men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realize she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom, check your location. While I'm at school, dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realize she's literally sitting there refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day three, mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 in a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit, which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses a client worth $2,000. Week 2, she sees I stopped at McDonald's for 3 minutes and lectures me about wasting money, which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for 4 hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and asks her 4 hours at one store? And mom stares at me like I should have warned her he was checking, but how can I when she's watching my every move? She used To text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until eleven PM Dad mentions that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough but I've been to that clinic. They close at 6 that night. Dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives marked final notice and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that and mom says processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location pins on the Week 5 and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the Medical Plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11:00am and it's now six PM I tell my manager I'm sick. Drive over, Dad's already there in the parking lot looking at life. 3, 60 zoomed in. Her car is not here, I say and dad points across the street where the pin actually is. We both see it at the same same time. Royal Flush Casino. Dad's face goes white. No way. We walk in together. She's at the penny slots with a bucket of coins, empty drink cups stacked everywhere. She's been here all day. She's talking to Another woman. My family thinks I'm at the doctor. It gives me all day here. She puts a 20 in the machine. This is from my daughter's paycheck. She'll never know. I step forward. I know now. Mom spends around seeing us both and dad holds up life. Three, 60, doctor appointment. She starts stammering, but her casino friend makes it worse. Just tell them about your system. You're due for a big win after last month's losses. Dad's voice cracks. Last month, how much? Now Mom's crying, saying 8,000, maybe more. I realized why she's been watching our location so obsessively. She needed to know we weren't coming home while she gambled away our money. I feel sick realizing this is where she went. All those times I told dad she was at appointments. I helped her lie so she could sit here feeding our rent money into slot machines. Mom admits she's been going every day for three.

We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest, she says. If we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear, which sounds like something a dictator would say. But whatever. She makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realize immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3, 60 doesn't just show where you are, it shows your speed when driving, your phone battery and sends notification for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect. Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says, no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is, men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realize she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom, check your location. While I'm at school, dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realize she's literally sitting there refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day three, mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 in a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit, which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses a client worth $2,000. Week 2, she sees I stopped at McDonald's for 3 minutes and lectures me about wasting money, which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for 4 hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and asks her 4 hours at one store? And mom stares at me like I should have warned her he was checking, but how can I when she's watching my every move? She used To text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until eleven PM Dad mentions that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough but I've been to that clinic. They close at 6 that night. Dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives marked final notice and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that and mom says processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location pins on the Week 5 and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the Medical Plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11:00am and it's now six PM I tell my manager I'm sick. Drive over, Dad's already there in the parking lot looking at life. 3, 60 zoomed in. Her car is not here, I say and dad points across the street where the pin actually is. We both see it at the same same time. Royal Flush Casino. Dad's face goes white. No way. We walk in together. She's at the penny slots with a bucket of coins, empty drink cups stacked everywhere. She's been here all day. She's talking to Another woman. My family thinks I'm at the doctor. It gives me all day here. She puts a 20 in the machine. This is from my daughter's paycheck. She'll never know. I step forward. I know now. Mom spends around seeing us both and dad holds up life. Three, 60, doctor appointment. She starts stammering, but her casino friend makes it worse. Just tell them about your system. You're due for a big win after last month's losses. Dad's voice cracks. Last month, how much? Now Mom's crying, saying 8,000, maybe more. I realized why she's been watching our location so obsessively. She needed to know we weren't coming home while she gambled away our money. I feel sick realizing this is where she went. All those times I told dad she was at appointments. I helped her lie so she could sit here feeding our rent money into slot machines. Mom admits she's been going every day for three.

I was marinating ribs at 6:00am when Lexi texted me, you're uninvited. We don't want you there. No explanation, just a cold dismissal from the person who never lifted a finger for these reunions. For eight years, I've been the backbone of every family gathering. I brought the smoker, bought all the alcohol, coordinated everything. Lexie just showed up and took credit while I did the actual work. She'd waltz in wearing some designer dress, pose for photos and act like she organized everything. While I was sweating over a hot grill, I stared at that text, hands covered in marinade, and typed back, fine, I'm taking my barbecue and drinks with me. An hour later, my phone exploded, 15 missed calls from cousins, uncles, everyone panicking. Wait, you're not coming? What about the food? Lexi said you bailed on us. My voicemail was completely full. Text after text rolled in. Please tell me you're joking. The reunion won't be the same without your brisket. What happened? That's when I realized Lexi's fatal mistake. She never told them she uninvited me. She just announced I canceled, left them scrambling with no backup plan. Classic Lexi, creating problems and expecting everyone else to solve them. I texted my cousin Matthew, Lexi uninvited me, but you're welcome at my place. I've got everything we need. Matthew immediately called back. Absolutely Furious. She did what? That's completely insane. I'm coming over and bringing everyone I can convince. Within minutes, half the family was choosing my backyard over Lexi's disaster. Even the neighbours wanted in. When word spread about the impromptu cookout happening on my street, my phone kept buzzing with acceptances. Uncle Hank on my way with the cornhole boards and my famous hot sauce. Cousin Liz bringing my potato salad and the good folding chairs. Even my elderly Aunt Diana said she'd rather come to mine because that girl has no business running anything important. By 10:00am, I had people showing up to help set up. My neighbour Jeff brought his outdoor speakers and string lights. The kids from down the street asked if they could use my pool. This was turning into something way bigger than any family reunion we'd ever had. Lexi started calling around noon, completely panicked. Where is everyone? Only six people showed up and I ordered food for 30. I could hear the desperation and anger in her voice. She tried to exclude me but ended up excl including herself from the real party. By one PM, I had 43 people at my house, the biggest party I'd ever thrown. The ribs were falling off the bone. The beer was ice cold and everyone kept thanking me for saving their weekend. Kids were splashing in the pool. Adults were playing cards and the whole neighborhood smelled like heaven. Meanwhile, Aunt Diana called me laughing, Lexi's Reunion is a complete disaster. She ordered pizza for 30 people and only has six there, including herself. She's blaming everyone but herself and having a complete meltdown in front of what's left of the family. The best part, three more family showed up uninvited because they heard through the neighborhood Grapevine about the legendary barbecue happening on Maple Street. Even people who weren't family wanted to join the.

And I realize immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3, 60 doesn't just show where you are, it shows your speed when driving, your phone battery and sends notification for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect. Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says, no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is, men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realize she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom, check your location. While I'm at school, dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realize she's literally sitting there refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day 3, mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 and a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit, which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck. Traffic won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses a client worth $2,000. Week 2, she sees I stopped at McDonald's for 3 minutes and lectures me about wasting money, which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for 4 hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and asks her 4 hours at one store? And mom stares at me like I should have warned her he was checking, but how can I when she's watching my every move? She used to Text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until eleven PM Dad mentions, that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough, but I've been to that clinic. They close at 6 that night. Dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives marked final notice and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that. And mom says, processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location pins on the map. Week 5 and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the Medical Plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11:00am and it's now six PM I tell my manager I'm sick and drive over. Dad's already there in the parking lot looking at life. Three sixty zoomed in. Her car is not here, I say. And dad points across the street where the pin actually is. We both see it at the same time. Royal Flush Casino. Dad's face go.

I stared at my phone screen, reading it three times. Mom and dad had been separated for six months. The custody battle was getting ugly. I was 14, splitting time between their apartments and everything felt broken. Then my phone buzzed again. Call me now. Mom's voice was desperate when I answered. Did you see my text? Yeah. What the hell are you asking me to do? Your father is winning. His lawyer destroyed me in court today. I need evidence that you're not safe with him. My chest tightened. Mom, you want me to fake suicide notes? Not a suicide note, a journal entry. The therapist appointment is tomorrow. Doctor Rossi needs to see that you have these thoughts at his place. Her voice got urgent. Write that you stare at his sleeping pills count and you think about taking them when he's asleep. Mom, stop. Listen to me. If I don't get full custody, your father loses his health insurance. Through my job, you know he needs insulin. It's $800 a month without coverage. She paused. He's already rationing. You've seen it. You can't use his diabetes against me. I'm using it for him. If you write this, I get custody and I'll keep him on my insurance for the whole year. Even after the divorce, I sat on my bed feeling sick. Dad had been rationing his insulin. I've seen him skip doses, checking his blood sugar obsessively, trying to stretch his supplies. Last week, his hands were shaking so bad he couldn't open a water bottle. I can't write that I want to die. You're not actually suicidal. It's just words on paper. Write that. Being at his apartment makes you feel hopeless, that you think about ending it, that you wonder if anyone would care. She was crying, now, please for his help. The next morning, she showed up at Dad's apartment while he was at work. She handed me a notebook and a folded paper. Copy this in your handwriting. I opened her notes. The words made me nauseous. I think about ending it. I wonder if anyone would care. When I'm at his apartment, I imagine taking all 47 of his pills, he wouldn't find me until morning. Mom, this is insane. This is necessary. Your therapist already knows you keep a journal. I told her last week you've been writing concerning things. My stomach dropped. You already told her. Just copy it. Please think about your father going into diabetic coma, dying. You want that on your conscience. She left the papers on my desk. The appointment is at 3. I'll pick you up at 2:30. I sat there for an hour, pen in hand. Mom wasn't wrong about Dad's health. Last month, he collapsed at work. The paramedics said his blood sugar was at 340. The hospital Bill was $3,000 just for That one visit without insurance, he'd die. Maybe a lie about wanting to die could keep him alive. I picked up the pen, started copying the first line. Then I stopped and put the pen down, picked up my phone and took pictures of every page she'd written, every horrible word she wanted me to claim as mine. At 2:30, mom arrived. Did you do it? I handed her the blank notebook. What is this? That's my journal. It's empty. Yeah, it is. Her face went red. The appointment is in 30 minutes. Need to do this now. I'm not writing suicide notes about dad. She grabbed my shoulders. Please, I'm begging you. Just tell Doctor Rossi you have these thoughts at his place. You don't need to write anything. Just say it. Say you've thought about the pills. I'm not lying about wanting to die. You're killing your father by not doing this. No, mom, you're killing me by asking. Doctor Rossi's office was too warm. Mom sat next to me, her leg bouncing against mine. So Doctor Rossi said, your mother tells me you've been journaling about some.

I found out the day of their anniversary. I drove up expecting a Celebration and instead found blood staining the front door and the window smashed. Inside, I saw Rebecca sitting on the couch getting her face stitched up, while my cousin Terry, who everyone teased for being a standoffish pacifist, stood with bleeding knuckles and a stone cold face. Terry, what have you done? Grandma was screaming while clutching her chest. Living room looked like a bare knuckle boxing ring. Blood splattered across anniversary decorations, shattered glass everywhere. You're going to prison. Uncle Pete was dialing 9 1 1. Look at her face. Twenty relatives descended on Terry like vultures. Your brother's wife, Cousin John, grabbed Terry's shirt on their anniversary. Rebecca sobbed, blood running down her dress. He grabbed me by the hair, slammed my face into the table. I thought he was going to call me, but something was wrong. Dave sat frozen in the corner, his own wife brutalized, and he just stared at the floor, not moving, not speaking, not even looking at her. Dave, why aren't you. Aunt Linda started. He knows why. Terry said quietly, the room exploded. There's no excuse. You're an animal. How could you hit a woman? But Dave still didn't move. After 10 minutes of everyone screaming at Terry, threatening him, calling police, someone finally asked Terry why. Terry finally answered, she's been beating Dave for Three years! Liar! Rebecca lurched forward, but Uncle Pete held her back. Remember Christmas when Dave had that broken rib? She hit him with a baseball bat while he slept. The work scars on his back. She threw boiling water on him. If she hit him, why did he never fight back? Cousin John asked sarcastically. Terry pulled out his phone and Rebecca's voice filled the room. Try to leave and I'll tell everyone you molested Liam. I'll bruise myself up, tear my clothes and Christ the goose assault to the police. Who will they believe, Dave, the sobbing woman or the man? People's faces turned, but the recording continued. You eat when I say, you sleep where I say. Dave's voice cut through. Please just let me spend time with my boy. Then Rebecca shooting back, you see Liam only when I allow it. Or I make one phone call and you never see him again. I have friends who'll testify they saw you hit me. The tension in the room grew. Uncle Pete slowly let go of Rebecca's arm, stepping back. Grandma turned to Rebecca. You threatened. And him? Rebecca tried to speak, but Aunt Linda cut her off. All those times Dave had bruises, that was you. Why didn't anyone tell us? Mom asked, looking around. I did tell you! Terry's voice exploded. I told you about the bruises. You said couples fight. I told grandma about the cigarette burns. She said Dave needs to man up. I begged Uncle Pete when I saw the burn marks. He said, not our business. Mom's hand covered her mouth. Oh god, you did tell me. Grandma looked at the floor. I thought men should handle their own problems. Went to the police three times, Terry continued. They said Dave had to file the complaint himself. So he tried. Then she showed up at the station with self inflicted bruises on her arms. They nearly arrested him. After that, he never tried again. Aunt Linda stepped away from Rebecca. Jesus Christ, Rebecca, how could you? Dave was almost in tears when he stood up and slowly lifted his shirt. Cigarette burns covered his ribs and long scars on his stomach. The room gasped. Uncle Pete pointed at Rebecca. You did this! You burned him! This is what she did. Because I tried to report it. Rebecca's mask was cracking. You pathetic little. But there's something else even more disgusting. Everyone froze completely. What do you mean? I whispered. Liam came to me a few days ago. Terry's voice broke. He asked me why mommy makes him do photo

The principal stops reading my college rejection letter, my third one this week, and looks up at me. Your GPA is excellent, she reads, frowning at her screen. But it says here you have zero extracurriculars. I explained to her that I stay after school every day to help other students, but the principal frowns, saying, the activities log shows you've never joined a single club or done even an hour of community service. I tell her I'm literally in room 2:03 until 6:30 p m. Every day, sometimes until 9 during playoffs. Just ask Mister Hayes. She pulls up security footage on her computer, and there I am in room 2 0 3 with five varsity football players, including our state champion quarterback, writing five different essays while they're on their phones. The principal's face goes white as she asks me, you're doing their homework? I'm confused. I explained to her that Mister Hayes says it's pure tutoring for my college application, but she types something into her laptop and turns the screen toward me, saying, there's no record of any tutoring program in our system. My mouth goes dry, and I feel my stomach dropped through the floor because I've been doing this for three years, every single day after school, all while Mister Hayes told me Harvard loves students who help athletes succeed. However, I can only assume Harvard doesn't love students who do athletes Homework for them. The principal calls in the guidance counselor, who pulls my record, saying, you've missed every college prep meeting. I explained that Mister Hayes said the tutoring was more important. The counselors fingers freeze over the keyboard. The counselor asks, did you write your own college essays yet? And I tell them that I started them. Mister Hays said they needed editing. She asked me if he edited them, and I admit no. He said I should focus on helping the team first. The counselor's face goes pale and she grips the edge of the desk as she says, you missed your own deadline, helping others meet theirs. But I defend him, my voice getting smaller, saying Mister Hays says the team brings in thousands of dollars to the school, and my grades are good enough as is. I should help those who have a lower chance of success. The principal shakes her head and something in her eyes makes my chest tight as she says, your grades are excellent, but colleges rejected you because you're a ghost with no activities, no personality, no recommendations that aren't about how helpful you are to others, just grades. That's when it hits me like a punch to the stomach. I realized I spent so much time writing everyone else's story, I forgot to write my own. Mister Hayes freezes in the doorway when he sees us, his coffee cup halfway to his lips, and he tries to turn around and Leave. But the principal calls him in, asking about his tutoring program. Mr. Hays sets down his coffee and acts casual, saying, oh, she's our best tutor. So helpful to everyone. Then the principal turns her laptop toward him, showing the security footage, and his face change, just completely, going from fake smile to cornered animal. He says, those students need support. They have learning differences. His voice is getting higher, saying, do you know how much the sports program brings in? Then he turns to me, desperate now, saying, tell them how much you love helping. Tell them. But I stay silent. And for the first time in three years, I don't defend him. The counselor is in Mister Hayes's face. You told a student this would help their college applications?

I was 22 when I applied for my dream job. Standard background check, they said, no big deal. Then HR called me a week later, said there were red flags with my application. Said there was a gap in my dad's employment history that concerned them. The same dad who always bragged about his perfect career trajectory? The same dad who said we moved when I was 12 for his big ocean. I told HR it must be some confusion. My dad was a successful construction worker. But they suggested I look into it before proceeding. I googled my dad's name with our Old Town. First result was a newspaper archive from 2,014. It said our local youth coach was under investigation for misconduct. My dad's face staring back at me. Click link after link. Parents demanded answers at emergency school meetings. One said second student comes forward. Third allegation rock soccer program. Every article dated the exact week we left. Dad had said the promotion opportunity came up suddenly, so we had to leave immediately or he'd lose it. Mom cried for three states straight. I thought she was sad about leaving her friends. The articles painted a clear timeline. March 3rd, first complaint filed. March 8th, school suspended him from coaching. March 15th, police opened investigation. March 18th, we moved. No forwarding address, no goodbye parties, no nothing. Just gone. The last article was from March 20th. Suspect in youth abuse case disappears. They Use the word suspect. My dad was a suspect. The reporter included a quote from a parent. He knew we were onto him. Back up and ran like a coward he is. Those boys deserve justice. I called the newspaper, asked for the reporter who covered the story. She still work there? Remembered everything. Said my dad was the assistant coach for three different teams. Multiple boys came forward independently. They had similar stories about private training sessions. The detective was building a case when we vanished. One family hired a private investigator, but trail went cold in Nevada. We lived in Nevada for six months before moving to Arizona. Dad said it was for tax purposes. Public records request got me the police files. Three boys gave statements, ages 11, 12, and 13. Detailed accounts of what happened in the equipment room after practice. What happened in my dad's car during rides home. What happened during tournament, hotel stays. One boy's statement mentioned me. I was always around, but never knew. My dad would buy us both ice cream afterward. He had to watch me laugh and eat my cone while he felt sick. That boy was Preston, my best friend. He suddenly stopped coming over that last month. Mom said his family was dealing with personal issues. I confronted my dad with everything. Printed out 40 pages of articles, police reports, witness statements. He went pale, started stammering about misunderstandings. And I showed him Preston statement. The one That mentioned me. The one that described specific dates, times, places he broke. Admitted everything. Said he had a problem and got help. He said that's why he never coached again, never volunteered, never came to my school events. He was keeping himself away from kids. Mom sat there.

But she wasn't laughing when I took her literally. I've been married to Lisa for five years. I'm an engineer making 78 k. She's a nurse practitioner making 82 k. Always pulled our money together into joint accounts. Last month, Lisa comes home from her girls night all excited. Babe Sarah and Jen both have separate finances with their husbands. We're both doing so well financially. What if we each just handle our own expenses? More independence, you know, more modern. Honestly, it sounded reasonable. We're both adults making decent money. Why not? Sure, let's split everything, 50, 50, rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, everything. She seemed a bit surprised by how specific I was getting. Well, I meant more like we each pay for our own stuff. You handle the bills you want, I handle mine. More flexible. Red flag, but I agreed anyway. Maybe she had a point about flexibility. So the next day I sat down with our budget and divided everything perfectly down the middle. Rent one, $400 each. You utilities, $150 each. Internet, $50 each. Groceries, $400 each. Insurance, $200 each. Car payments, gas, personal expenses, all separate. I made a nice little spreadsheet and showed her. She said, wow, okay, very thorough, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Here's what I didn't expect. Lisa is absolutely terrible with money, always has been. I just never noticed because I've been handling all our finances. For five years, never had to budget or track expenses. Week 2, hey babe, can you cover utilities this month? I bought this amazing Korean skincare set that was on sale. I'll pay you back next week. Week 3, my half of rent is gonna be a few days late. Had to get my car detailed and got those highlights I've been wanting. You don't mind covering me, right? Week 4, can you grab groceries this week? I'm a little short until payday. Work has been so stressful. I deserve that shopping trip. I started keeping track of every loan in my phone just out of curiosity. Meanwhile, I'm actually thriving without her impulse purchases draining our joint account. I'm investing my leftover money, started putting $800 a month into index funds, something I never could do before because money would just disappear. Peer month two, she owes me one I ton and $50 in temporary loans, rent, utilities, groceries, even her portion of our anniversary dinner at that expensive steakhouse she insisted on trying. It's just temporary, babe. Once I get my spending under control and figure out this whole budgeting thing. But it's actually getting worse instead of better. She's buying a hundred and fifty dollar Lululemon sets, three different subscription boxes, constantly eating out for lunch instead of packing like she used to. Getting her nails done every two weeks at $80 a pop. She makes $4,000 more per year than me, but somehow always comes up Completely short. Month three, she's sitting at our kitchen table at eleven PM crying actual tears because her credit card is maxed out at 4,000 dollars. She can't make her 320 dollar car payment that's due tomorrow. And according to my phone notes, she owes me exactly 3,400 dollar total. I don't understand how this happened. I make good money. I should have way more left over than you do. I pulled out my phone and open my investment app, turn the screen toward her. 20 eight hundred dollars built up in just three months even while covering most of her expenses and maintaining my own lifestyle. This is absolutely crazy, she said, staring at the screen like it was displaying alien hieroglyphics. You're like actually wealthy now. How are you?

My jaw dropped at my friend's audacity. Chuck is literally such a freaking loser. I don't know why we kept inviting him to things, Serena said, rolling her eyes when I asked where he was. But he's been our friend since college, I said. Nate groaned. That's exactly the problem. We all went to the same college, and now he's stuck working at target. It's embarrassing. Dan nodded. Last time he was here, he ordered water and the cheapest thing on the menu. But you guys order water, too? Sometimes, I argued. Serena slid her Ray Bans down and stared at me with a bored expression. We're 27 now. It's time to upgrade to better friends. As if that Sunday brunch wasn't horrifying enough, that same night when Chuck texted the group chat saying, hey guys, really need someone to talk to, Serena made a separate group chat just to mock him. Ten bucks says he needs money, not a talk. Just don't respond. We're not his ATM. They laughed at him in the chat. I made sure to call him secretly. Hey, Chuck, what's up? Chuck sniffled. Just a terrible time right now. I. My mom's test results came back from the hospital. Stage three. My eyes widened. Okay, stay where you are. I'm headed over to your house. I spent that night at Chuck's place. We drank cheap beer and watched old comedy specials while his mom slept. Upstairs, Chuck didn't cry again, just kept saying it is what it is every time his voice started to waver. In the morning, I texted the group chat. The one without Chuck asking. Hey, could you guys come over to Chuck's place? His mom's seriously sick and he could use some friends. But Serena, Nate, and Dan all made different excuses not to go there for him. I'm busy on this presentation. I have a networking event today. Sorry, can't need sleep. Chuck smiled, saying that it's fine. But it wasn't. Over the next few weeks, as Chuck's mom got worse, so did my friends. When Chuck posted a gofundme for medical bills, Serena screenshot it in our separate chat. Called it I knew he wanted money. She reported it as a scam. Nate saw Chuck at the grocery store and literally hid behind the cereal aisle. I can't deal with his sob story right now. He texted us with a selfie of him crouching behind cans of spam. Dan went further. He unfriended Chuck on everything. I don't need that negativity in my feed, he said at brunch while showing us his vacation photos. Besides, it's manipulative how he keeps posting about his mom. We get it, she's sick. Does he really need to bring down the mood with that? Like, let me doom scroll through Hot Girls in Peace. Nate burst out into laughter at his comment. Serena smirked, unfriending him too. I felt sick. How could things Have gotten so different since college. Chuck's mom passed that same week. I attended his funeral. Sat in the front row with his co workers. Almost 100 people came out to support, all boasting about Chuck and his mom's kindness, while our Three Stooges, Nate, Serena, Dan were nowhere. I thought they'd at least text, Chuck said quietly. But Karma soon caught up with them and hit each person with a vengeance. Nate went first. Panic attack during a million dollar presentation. Full breakdown. Crying, hyperventilating. Had to be carried out on a stretcher in front of the entire board. When he texted the group chat asking for someone to help him with his panic attack, no one responded. Serena was next. After working 22 hours straight, she sent her clients confidential files to their competitor, five

When I was 17, my older brother Matthew was diagnosed with kidney disease. This wasn't completely unexpected. He'd been feeling unwell for months. We all thought it was just stress from college. The diagnosis changed everything. The doctors explained he would need a transplant within a year. Our parents immediately got tested, but neither was compatible. My sister Barbara, who is 22 and living across the country, flew home to get tested, too. She wasn't a match, either. That left me and our cousins, aunts and uncles. Everyone agreed to get tested. I didn't think much about what it would mean if I was a match. I just went to the hospital with my mom, gave blood samples, and went through a physical exam. Two weeks later, the transplant coordinator called our house. I picked up because everyone else was out. You're a potential match for Matthew, she said. We need you to come in for additional testing. I hung up and sat at the kitchen table for an hour, not moving. When my mom came home with groceries, I told her. She put the bags down and started making calls to my dad and Barbara. The additional testing was more intense. They explained all the risks. Complications from surgery, potential long term effects, recovery time. I would miss at least three weeks of school during my senior year. There was also a small chance my remaining Kidney could fail someday, which would put me in Matthew's position. I didn't tell any of my friends what was happening. Sylvia, my best friend since elementary school, knew something was wrong, but stopped asking when I changed the subject repeatedly. I didn't want advice or sympathy. This wasn't a decision I could crowd source. My parents were careful not to pressure me. It has to be your choice, my dad said during dinner one night. That made it harder somehow. Part of me wanted them to just tell me what to do. The hardest part was talking to Matthew. He wouldn't discuss it. When I brought it up, he changed the subject or left the room. One night, I cornered him in the kitchen when everyone else was asleep. If you don't want my kidney, just say so. He looked at me for a long time. I don't want you to regret this when you're older. That was the first time I considered that this decision would affect my entire life, not just the next few months. I was planning to go to college next year. How would surgery affect that? What about playing soccer, which I loved? What about future health insurance costs? What if I had kids someday who needed a kidney? My cousin Jonathan came over one evening to play video games with Matthew. Afterward, he pulled me aside. My dad donated a kidney to his brother 15 years ago. He's never regretted it, but he Says it wasn't simple. Jonathan's dad was my uncle Dexter, who I rarely saw because he lived on the West Coast. I hadn't known about his donation. The transplant team wanted an answer soon. Matthew's kidney function was declining faster than they'd initially projected. I made a spreadsheet listing pros and cons, which felt ridiculous for a decision this big. The pro column had one entry. Matthew lives. Conclusion had a dozen entries about my future. One Saturday, I ran into my math teacher, Missus Carla Peters, at the grocery store. She asked why I seemed distracted in class. Without planning to, I told her everything. She listened without interrupting. When I was 16, my parents asked if I would quit school to help support the family, she said I said no. And I've always wondered what would have happened if I'd said yes. That wasn't exactly helpful either. But it made me realize something. There was no perfect answer. Whatever I decided, I'd always wonder about the other path. The day I turned seventeen and a/2, I called the transplant coordinator and told her I would do it. The surgery was scheduled for the following month. When I told my parents, they hugged me so hard I couldn't breathe. Which made me realize they hadn't been as neutral as they pretended. Matthew found me in my room that night. He sat on my bed and handed me an envelope. Inside was a letter he'd written detailing all the things he planned. To do with his life, if the transplant worked. It was the most he'd communicated with me in months. If you change your mind, that's okay, he said. But I didn't change my mind two days before the surgery.

My girlfriend Diana broke up with me after three years, saying I was emotionally unavailable and she needed someone more passionate, more present. You're always distracted, Jake. I feel like I'm dating a ghost. When we talk, you're somewhere else. When we make plans, you cancel last minute with some lame excuse. I can't keep doing this anymore. I deserve better than whatever this is. She was absolutely right. I had been distant, barely listening during conversations, constantly checking my phone during dinner dates, canceling our weekend plans with weak excuses about being tired or having urgent work stuff that couldn't wait. What she didn't know was the real reason behind everything. For the past eight months, I've been secretly caring for my mom, who was going through aggressive chemotherapy treatments for state stage 3 breast cancer. Every single day after work, I drive two hours across town to her house, help her with doctor appointments, manage her complex medication schedule, clean her house, grocery shop, and make sure she was eating enough to keep strength up during treatment. Mom made me swear on everything I held dear not to tell anyone about her diagnosis. She was absolutely terrified of people treating her differently, looking at her with those pitying eyes. Or worse, her boss finding out and pushing her toward early retirement before she was financially ready. I don't want to be the cancer lady, Jake. She Say, while I helped her with her weekly pill organizer. I wanna fight this battle quietly and get back to my normal life without everyone thinking I'm fragile or broken. So instead of explaining to Diana why I was constantly exhausted and emotionally drained, I became the mysterious, unavailable boyfriend who seemed to care more about unknown commitments than nurturing our relationship. Diana moved out on a Tuesday morning, taking her plants and half our furniture. By Friday night, she was already posting Instagram stories from fancy restaurants with Derek from her marketing team. Within two weeks, they were Facebook official with matching couple photos. Her social media transformed into a carefully curated highlight reel of romantic sunset dinners, spontaneous weekend getaways to wine country, and heartfelt captions about finally discovering authentic love with someone who actually shows up consistently and puts genuine effort into the relationship. Meanwhile, I was spending my evenings in sterile hospital waiting rooms, holding my mom's trembling hand during her chemotherapy infusion sessions and lying to concerned friends who kept asking why Diana and I had suddenly broken up after seeming so happy together. Two months after the breakup, Mom's latest blood work came back completely clear. The oncologist said she'd beaten the cancer entirely and could start planning for her future again. At her remission Celebration dinner at her favorite Italian restaurant, Diana's younger sister Claire happened to be there. Turns out she'd recently started working at Mom's Insurance Company, and they developed a Close friendship during Mom's treatment period, bonding over their shared love of mystery novels. Claire sees the Celebration photos on my Instagram story and immediately starts connecting dots in her head. She realizes.

So I started treating him like my actual father. I've been killing myself for five years at my job when Jimmy, my boss, called me into his office on a random Tuesday. Kevin, we're demoting you, he said, not even looking up from his MacBook. My heart stopped. I've never been late, handed in my work on time. It just didn't make sense. Your position is being given to my nephew, Bartholomew. He just graduated and needs leadership experience. My coffee went cold in my hand. You're demoting me to make room for your nephew? You'll be supporting him. But, hey, that's what family does. We help each other out. We're all family here, remember? I just closed on a house based on my senior developer salary, my mortgage. Family makes sacrifices, Kevin. Bartholomew needs this opportunity. And family support each other unconditionally. Plus, I need you working weekends. The whole team does. Family doesn't watch the clock. I stared at the motivational poster behind him. Family. Together, we achieve more. Right? Family. He beamed. See? I knew you'd understand. Family values are what make this company special. Monday morning, I walked straight into Jimmy's office without knocking. Morning, dad, I announced cheerfully, plopping down in his chair while he was getting coffee. Family doesn't need appointments, right? His face went red. Kevin, this is highly unprofessional. But we're family. You said so yourself. Can I borrow your Tesla This weekend? Jimmy gripped His coffee mug so tight, his knuckles went white. At lunch, I started eating his meal from the executive fridge. Jimmy stormed into the breakroom. It's my lunch! My mom always said, family shares everything. Your salmon tastes great, by the way. I took another bite while maintaining eye contact. He yanked the container away, breathing heavily. Tuesday, I submitted an official request to HR for tuition reimbursement. Jimmy is like a father to me. Said so. And my dad paid for my sister's MBA. HR called Jimmy immediately. He showed up at my desk red faced. We don't have a tuition program. But dad, family supports each other's growth. You supported Bartholomew's growth into my job. His jaw twitched. The court quarterly board meeting made his forehead vein throb. When he introduced me to investors, I interrupted, actually, this is my dad, Jimmy. The investors looked confused. Jimmy smile became manic. Kevin's joking. Dad's been having memory issues lately. I stage whispered. Jimmy's face went purple. The entire room went silent. I started calling him dad in every email CC in the entire company. At at that point, everyone called him Dad. Jimmy sent 17 emails demanding I stop. I replied all each time. Dad's cranky today. Someone needs a nap. When Bartholomew struggled with basic coding, I loudly announced, don't worry, Bartholomew. Grandpa Jimmy didn't hire you for your skills. That's what family nepotism is for. Jimmy burst from his office conference room. Now during his 20 minute Lecture about professionalism. I just kept nodding. You're right, dad. Family should communicate better. By Thursday, I brought my laundry to work. Dad. The machine at my apartment broke. Mind if I use yours? I started folding underwear during his client call. Then I asked his secretary for Jimmy's Netflix password because family shares streaming services. By week two, others joined in. Kelly from accounting started calling him papa Jimmy and asked for college tuition reimbursement. My real dad paid for my education. Caleb from IT brought his kids to the office. Uncle Jimmy can babysit while I code, right? That's what family does. His assistant said she'd never seen him take three Advil at once before. The hospital called him the following week. Mister Jimmy, you're listed as Kevin's emergency contact and next of kin. He's fine. Just need someone to sign these forms. He drove there furious, only to find me getting a routine check up. Families take care of each other's medical decisions, dad. By week three, Jimmy was cracking

I said I understand. Then I took the ring back and bought a house instead. I was supposed to marry Jenna in June. After four years together, everything seemed perfect until her dad Gordon pulled his power move at what was supposed to be a casual dinner three months before the wedding. Gordon always gave me weird vibes. Real estate broker who drove a least be MW he couldn't afford, constantly talked about building generational wealth while being behind on his own mortgage. But Jenna adored him, so I kept my mouth shut. That Tuesday night after we'd finished eating, Gordon pulled out an actual vanilla folder with typed documents inside, slid it across the table like we were in some corporate merger. Before you join this family officially, we need to discuss Jenna's education investment. He said the investment was $127,000 in student loans for her masters and creative writing from a private university, the one Gordon insisted she attend. Because prestige matters more than price, I need you to sign as co borrower on the refinancing. He can and you better rates with dual income. I flipped through the papers. Variable rates starting at 8.9%, 20 year term. Gordon, this would make me equally responsible for supporting your wife's dreams. Yes. He leaned back with this smug look. Unless you don't believe in her potential. Jenna finally spoke up. Dad, we talked about This being voluntary, sweetheart, a real man doesn't let his woman struggle with debt alone. I said, papers down. I need time to review this with a financial advisor. Gordon's face went red. Financial advisor, this is about trust. You either commit to this family fully or he let it hang there. Or what? Or maybe you're not ready for marriage and have the wedding if you're not committed to the family burden. I mean, investment. I looked at Jenna. She was crying silently, but something felt off. She was upset. Yeah. But not shocked, not angry at him. I understand, I said. The next morning I did some digging, found out through a mutual friend that Jenna had actually graduated with about six $3,000 in loan. The rest, Gordon had taken out parent plus loans and spent them on his BMW lease, a vacation to Cabo, new golf clubs. Now he wanted to consolidate everything and make me responsible for his spending. When I confronted Jenna that evening, she brought down completely. I didn't know how to tell you. He said he was helping with living expenses, but I found out later he was using it for himself. He promised he'd pay it back, but then his real estate deals fell through. And you knew this whole time I was going to tell you after the wedding. I swear, after, after I was legally bound to you. She couldn't deny it. I took the ring back that night. Not Dramatically just asked for it while she was sobbing on the couch. She handed it over without argument. Gordon called me 43 times the first day, leaving voicemails ranging from let's discuss this like men, to you're destroying my daughter, to I'll sue you for emotional damages. But here's the beautiful part. I saved $26,000 for our wedding. Every contract was in my name. Only because planning stresses Jenna out, I called the venue. Another couple had been waitlisted for our date. Lost maybe $800 total instead of $8,000. Put a down payment on a house instead. Three months later, the real karma started. See, when I refused to sign those refinancing documents, Gordon was stuck. Loans went into default. First call came while I was at work. They're garnishing my wages. They can't do this, Gordon. Those are your loans, parent, P L. U. S. Loans. Your name, your responsibility. But they were for Jenna. No, $63,000 was for Jenna. The rest was for your BMW and vacation.

I said I understand. Then I took the ring back and bought a house instead. I was supposed to marry Jenna in June. After four years together, everything seemed perfect until her dad Gordon pulled his power move at what was supposed to be a casual dinner three months before the wedding. Gordon always gave me weird vibes. Real estate broker who drove a least be MW he couldn't afford, constantly talked about building generational wealth while being behind on his own mortgage. But Jenna adored him, so I kept my mouth shut. That Tuesday night after we'd finished eating, Gordon pulled out an actual vanilla folder with typed documents inside, slid it across the table like we were in some corporate merger. Before you join this family officially, we need to discuss Jenna's education investment. He said the investment was $127,000 in student loans for her masters and creative writing from a private university, the one Gordon insisted she attend. Because prestige matters more than price, I need you to sign as co borrower on the refinancing. He can and you better rates with dual income. I flipped through the papers. Variable rates starting at 8.9%, 20 year term. Gordon, this would make me equally responsible for supporting your wife's dreams. Yes. He leaned back with this smug look. Unless you don't believe in her potential. Jenna finally spoke up. Dad, we talked about This being voluntary, sweetheart, a real man doesn't let his woman struggle with debt alone. I said, papers down. I need time to review this with a financial advisor. Gordon's face went red. Financial advisor, this is about trust. You either commit to this family fully or he let it hang there. Or what? Or maybe you're not ready for marriage and have the wedding if you're not committed to the family burden. I mean, investment. I looked at Jenna. She was crying silently, but something felt off. She was upset. Yeah. But not shocked, not angry at him. I understand, I said.

My brother inherited everything. I quietly canceled all transfers. I'm Brett, 32, and I built my contracting business from absolute zero. Started with a beat up truck and borrowed tools, working 16 hour days until my hands bled. Now I've got 12 employees and we're booked solid through next spring. My younger brother, Bryce, different story entirely. He's 27 and has never held a job longer than eight months. Bryce is the type who shows up to family dinners and designer clothes he can't afford, talking about his next big opportunity, while I'm still wearing work boots with concrete dust on them. For the past three years, I've been automatically transferring $20,800 every month to my parents account. Mom called it helping with the mortgage during tough times. Dad mentioned rising property taxes and medical bills. Never questioned it because they're my parents and twenty eight hundred dollars felt like the least I could do. But sitting in this mahogany paneled conference room listening to their state attorney read through their will, I realized how naive I'd been. Bryce inherits the house, all investment accounts and life insurance policies, the lawyer stated. Matter of factly, Brett receives the tools in the garage and your grandmother's China set. Tools and China after three years of mortgage payments? Seems like an oversight, I said calmly, though my chest was tightening. My mother shifted uncomfortably. Brett, Honey, Bryce needs more support than You do. You've always been so independent. And success. Bryce needs security, my father added. You've got your business, your house, your whole life figured out. Bryce is still finding his way. Finding his way at 27, after I'd started my business at 26 with nothing but determination. Can you explain what this mortgage is that I've been paying? I asked the lawyer directly. He flipped through documents. Your parents took out a 275 thousand dollar mortgage on their previously debt free home 3 years ago. Monthly payment is twenty eight hundred dollars. My stomach dropped. Their house had been paid off since I was in high school. What was the $275,000 used for? Bryce squirmed. Mom answered quickly. Bryce's Sports Bar downtown. Great location, lots of potential. His fourth business venture after the failed food truck, online clothing store, and cryptocurrency consulting company. Each funded by our parents, each ending in spectacular failure. So you took out a mortgage on your paid off house to fund Bryce's business? Had me pay that mortgage for three years without telling me. And now you're leaving everything to Bryce, including the house I've essentially been buying for him? That's very uncharitable, my mother said defensively. I stood up slowly. You're absolutely right. I don't need your help. I never have. I walked out without another word. That evening, I sat in my home office looking at my laptop. Three clicks would cancel the automatic transfer that had been quietly draining my business. Account for three years. I clicked cancel. Then I called my mortgage broker about those investment properties I've been considering. With an extra 28 dollars per month, I could easily handle the payments. Three weeks later, mom texted Brett the mortgage

I was marinating ribs at 6:00am when Lexi texted me, you're uninvited. We don't want you there. No explanation, just a cold dismissal from the person who never lifted a finger for these reunions. For eight years, I've been the backbone of every family gathering. I brought the smoker, bought all the alcohol, coordinated everything. Lexie just showed up and took credit while I did the actual work. She'd waltz in wearing some designer dress, pose for photos and act like she organized everything. While I was sweating over a hot grill, I stared at that text, hands covered in marinade, and typed back, fine, I'm taking my barbecue and drinks with me. An hour later, my phone exploded, 15 missed calls from cousins, uncles, everyone panicking. Wait, you're not coming? What about the food? Lexi said you bailed on us. My voicemail was completely full. Text after text rolled in. Please tell me you're joking. The reunion won't be the same without your brisket. What happened? That's when I realized Lexi's fatal mistake. She never told them she uninvited me. She just announced I canceled, left them scrambling with no backup plan. Classic Lexi, creating problems and expecting everyone else to solve them. I texted my cousin Matthew, Lexi uninvited me, but you're welcome at my place. I've got everything we need. Matthew immediately called back. Absolutely Furious. She did what? That's completely insane. I'm coming over and bringing everyone I can convince. Within minutes, half the family was choosing my backyard over Lexi's disaster. Even the neighbours wanted in. When word spread about the impromptu cookout happening on my street, my phone kept buzzing with acceptances. Uncle Hank on my way with the cornhole boards and my famous hot sauce. Cousin Liz bringing my potato salad and the good folding chairs. Even my elderly Aunt Diana said she'd rather come to mine because that girl has no business running anything important. By 10:00am, I had people showing up to help set up. My neighbour Jeff brought his outdoor speakers and string lights. The kids from down the street asked if they could use my pool. This was turning into something way bigger than any family reunion we'd ever had. Lexi started calling around noon, completely panicked. Where is everyone? Only six people showed up and I ordered food for 30. I could hear the desperation and anger in her voice. She tried to exclude me but ended up excl including herself from the real party. By one PM, I had 43 people at my house, the biggest party I've ever thrown. The ribs were falling off the bone. The beer was ice cold and everyone kept thanking me for saving their weekend kid. It was splashing in the pool. Adults were playing cards and the whole neighborhood smelled like heaven. Meanwhile, Aunt Diana called me laughing. Lexi's reunion is a complete disaster. She ordered pizza for 30 people and only has six there, including herself. She's blaming everyone but herself and having a complete meltdown in front of what's left of the family. The best part, three more family showed up uninvited because they heard through the neighborhood Grapevine about the legendary barbecue.

Lexie just showed up and took credit while I did the actual work. She'd waltz in wearing some designer dress, pose for photos and act like she organized everything. While I was sweating over a hot grill, I stared at that text, hands covered in marinade, and typed back, fine, I'm taking my barbecue and drinks with me. An hour later, my phone exploded, 15 missed calls from cousins, uncles, everyone panicking. Wait, you're not coming? What about the food? Lexi said you bailed on us. My voicemail was completely full. Text after text rolled in. Please tell me you're joking. The reunion won't be the same without your brisket. What happened? That's when I realized Lexi's fatal mistake. She never told them she uninvited me. She just announced I canceled, left them scrambling with no backup plan. Classic Lexi, creating problems and expecting everyone else to solve them. I texted my cousin Matthew, Lexi uninvited me, but you're welcome at my place. I've got everything we need. Matthew immediately called back. Absolutely Furious. She did what? That's completely insane. I'm coming over and bringing everyone I can convince. Within minutes, half the family was choosing my backyard over Lexi's disaster. Even the neighbours wanted in. When word spread about the impromptu cookout happening on my street, my phone kept buzzing with acceptances. Uncle Hank on my way with the cornhole boards and my famous hot sauce. Cousin Liz bringing my potato salad and the good folding chairs. Even my elderly Aunt Diana said she'd rather come to mine because that girl has no business running anything important. By 10:00am, I had people showing up to help set up. My neighbour Jeff brought his outdoor speakers and string lights. The kids from down the street asked if they could use my pool. This was turning into something way bigger than any family reunion we'd ever had. Lexi started calling around noon, completely panicked. Where is everyone? Only six people showed up and I ordered food for 30. I could hear the desperation and anger in her voice. She tried to exclude me but ended up excl including herself from the real party. By one PM, I had 43 people at my house, the biggest party I've ever thrown. The ribs were falling off the bone. The beer was ice cold and everyone kept thanking me for saving their weekend kid. It was splashing in the pool. Adults were playing cards and the whole neighborhood smelled like heaven. Meanwhile, Aunt Diana called me laughing. Lexi's reunion is a complete disaster. She ordered pizza for 30 people and only has six there, including herself. She's blaming everyone but herself and having a complete meltdown in front of what's left of the family. The best part, three more family showed up uninvited because they heard through the neighborhood Grapevine about the legendary barbecue.

Oh, honey, let me tell you about the time my daughter didn't talk to me for two whole weeks because I betrayed her trust over a damn chicken nugget. So my daughter, Lila, she's 14, has the attitude of a Beverly Hills housewife and the budget of a toddler. This girl acts like she's the CEO of the household, tells me things like, mom, please don't embarrass me in front of my friends. Just stand still and blink like, ma'am, you live in my uterus rent free for nine months. Show some respect. Anyway, she decides she's going vegan. Great. I support her. I buy tofu, almond milk, overpriced plant nuggets that taste like regret, the whole shebang. Do I understand it? No. But I'm a supportive queen. But then one night it's 1:00am, I'm watching reality TV in the dark and I get hungry. I open the freezer and see those dino shaped chicken nuggets she begged for last year and never ate. So I pop like 4 in the air fryer. I'm minding my business, living my best life. And guess what? I forget to hide the evidence. Next morning she walks into the kitchen, sniffs the air like a bloodhound and goes, did you eat meat in this house? I said, uh, baby. She gasps like I just committed war crimes. You ate dead animals while I was sleeping. I said, baby girl, they were shaped like dinosaurs. They're barely meat. Calm down. She grabs her reusable water bottle, slams it on the counter and yells, this is why the planet's dying, mom, because of people like you who can't control their midnight cravings. I said, okay, Greta Thunberg, relax. She storms off to her room and text me from down the hall. We're not speaking. This is a betrayal. I text back, fine, more dino nuggets for she leaves me on read y'all. Two weeks she wouldn't speak to me, not even when I stubbed my toe and screamed so loud the neighbors checked on me. She just walked past me with her Hydro flask and judgmental aura. But then get this, one day I come home early from work. I walk into the kitchen and there she is standing in front of the microwave holding a plate with three dino nuggets. She's caught midbite. We lock eyes, time freezes. She goes, they don't count if they're Dinosaur shaped. I said, excuse me. She wipes her mouth like a criminal and goes, don't tell dad. I said, oh, I'm telling everyone. She bribes me with her leftover Starbucks gift card and begs for mercy. I post the photo in our family group chat anyway, cap our little activist caught mid murder. Her grandpa replied, meat runs in the family. Her uncle sent a Dinosaur emoji. Now she talks to me again, but only if I swear never to bring it up again in front of her friends. So what do I do? Oh, I bring it up at every chance, especially when they start talking about saving the turtles, because if you're gonna give me the silent treatment over dino nuggets, you better be ready for extinction level consequences.

I was at my friend Sarah's wedding reception, seated at the head table as her maid of honor, when her cousin Jessica approached me looking frantic. Hey, I need you to move to a different table. My boyfriend showed up last minute, and we don't have anywhere to sit together. I explained that I was in the wedding party and this was my assigned seat next to the bride. Come on, it's just one seat. Sarah won't even notice. I politely said no and suggested she asked the venue coordinator about adding a chair somewhere else. Jessica rolled her eyes. I already tried that. They said the fire code won't allow extra chairs. I told her I was sorry, but I couldn't help with that. That's when Jessica's tone shifted completely. Are you seriously going to ruin my night over a stupid chair? I'm family. She started raising her voice, and other guests were turning to look. The bride's grandmother was sitting right across from us, watching with raised eyebrows. This is ridiculous. You're being so selfish. It's not even your wedding. The best man leaned over and asked if everything was okay. Jessica immediately turned to him. Your friend here is refusing to give up her seat so I can sit with my boyfriend. Can you talk some sense into her? He looked confused and said that we were all assigned specific seats for the wedding party. Photos, Jessica scoff. Photos? That's What this is about. Just take them later. I stayed calm and explained again that I wasn't moving from my assigned seat. Fine, I'll ask someone else to switch. Then Jessica stormed off toward other tables. Five minutes later, she was back, looking even more frustrated. Nobody will switch with me. They all said the same thing about assigned seats. This is your fault! She pointed her finger at me accusingly. The bride's uncle, who was sitting next to grandmother, cleared his throat loudly. Maybe if you had RSV peed properly, you wouldn't have this problem, he said dryly. Jessica's face flushed. Excuse me, this is none of your business. Actually, it became my business when you started yelling at the wedding party during my niece's reception. That's when Jessica really lost it. She turned back to me with her voice getting louder. You know what? You're just jealous that I have someone and you came here alone. The entire head table went silent. I been nothing but nice and you're treating me like garbage! All I want is to sit with my boyfriend! Jessica then marched over to Sarah, who was taking photos with her husband's family, and started gesturing wildly at me. I watched as Jessica interrupted the photographer and pulled Sarah aside, pointing in my direction. Sarah walked over, looking confused, still holding her bouquet. What's going on? Your friend is refusing to move so my boyfriend and I can sit together. She's being a total bridezilla. And it's not even her day. Sarah blinked, slowly processing what she was hearing. Wait, what boyfriend? James. He drove three hours to be here, and now he's stuck at some random table in the corner.

Mom says if you disappeared tomorrow, no one would even notice. While opening the 850 dollar phone I bought her. All 30 guests laughed except me. I nodded and with 2 taps I shut down every payment. Credit bills, sub scriptions gone for years. I paid Lindsay's rent, covered Dad's gambling debts, handled mom's credit cards, and bought countless expensive gift. I was the responsible one who always said yes when they needed money. But never really part of the family, just their walking ATM. The birthday party had 30 relatives gathered around. I driven straight from work to deliver that phone. Another expensive gesture to show my love. My niece peeled away the plastic with delicate fingers, but her words cut like glass. Mom says if you disappeared tomorrow, no one would even notice. The room erupted in laughter. Lindsay smirked from the couch like she'd been waiting for this moment. Mom pretended not to hear from the kitchen, but her shoulders lifted in silent approval. Dad raised his beer and chuckled. Well, she's not wrong. Even Uncle Gary, who barely knew me beyond family dinners, snorted into his drink. Cousin's grin. Thirty people laughed at my expense while I stood there like the fool I'd always been, the one who paid for everything but mattered to no one. But this time something different happened. Instead of forcing a smile, I felt my phone in my pocket and made two quick taps. Every Bill I paid, every subscriber option I managed, every credit line I'd set up for them. Gone. Just like that. The voices blurred into distant noise as I slipped out without saying goodbye. No one noticed me leave the one thing my niece got right. I went home, packed essentials, then returned with an old black backpack. While they celebrated, I slipped inside, left it by the stairs, and disappeared forever. Inside was proof of everything. Receipts, bank statements, payment records, showing exactly how much I'd done for people who thought I was nothing. The explosion came the next morning. Dad pounded on my door at dawn, shouting about betrayal and family loyalty. Mom sent desperate texts. How could you do this to your own family? Lindsay called six times, then messaged. You think we can't live without you? Fine. See how long you last without a family. That evening, they broke into my apartment using an old key. Dad stormed in, red faced, mom behind him, both frantic about suddenly cancelled credit cards and unpayable bills. You ungrateful little troublemaker! Dad snarled, stepping closer with clenched fists. Try it, I said calmly, still drying my hair from the shower. His hand trembled but didn't move. We both knew he wasn't a fighter, just a bully hiding behind words. The cards don't work, Mom's voice cracked. Lindsay can't pay bills, the mortgage bounced. Everything I paid for is over, I said. You think we need you? Dad laughed bitterly. Seems Like you do, since you broke into my apartment just to beg. Dad later invited me to a football game, claiming he wanted to talk like men. When I arrived, he clutched my black backpack, thinking he'd found leverage against me. We found this, he said smugly. We know your secret, your lies. Open it, then, I challenged. Let's see what you think you know. His confidence crumbled as I

When I asked why she needed new lingerie for a business trip, I said, not insecure, just observant. She panicked when she realized I called her boss. Monica and I had been together four years, living in my apartment for two. Last Sunday, I caught her packing for her quarterly Regional Farms conference. Normal work stuff in her suitcase. Blazers, dress pants, professional blouses. Then I saw the Victoria's secret bag. New stuff for the trip? I asked. Yeah, needed some fresh basics, she replied. Without looking up, I peeked in the bag. Red lace set, black silk teddy. Definitely not basics. That's some fancy underwear for a conference. She Scott, you're insecure about a work conference. It's just underwear, Nate. You've been to five conferences, never needed lingerie before. Are you tracking my underwear purchases? Now? That's psycho behavior. Maybe I just want to feel confident presenting to the board. The board's going to see your underwear. When I feel good in what I'm wearing underneath, I present better. It's a woman thing. You wouldn't understand. While she was in the bathroom, I checked her laptop, searched regional farms quarterly meeting in her inbox. Zero results. I searched her boss Diane's name. Last email was 2 weeks ago about expense reports. Then I called Regional Farms main number and left Diane a voicemail. Hi, Diane, this is Nate, Monica's boyfriend. Monica mentioned the quarterly conference starts Tuesday, and I wanted To surprise her, could you let me know which hotel the company booked? I'd like to send flowers to her room Monday morning. Diane called back at 9:00am sharp. Nate, I got your message. I'm confused. There's no quarterly conference this week. Monica requested PTO for personal days. My stomach dropped. She taken PTO, lied about a conference that didn't exist, and bought lingerie for her presentation. Confidence, Monica. I texted, leaving for airport soon. Going to crush this presentation. At 4:15, when she was at the airport, I called a locksmith, changed the locks, then packed all her things. Clothes, shoes, toiletries, her peloton bike. Everything went into boxes in the building storage room. At 7:30, she texted, landed, heading to hotel. Might explore tonight. I typed my response. Hey, babe. Diane called me back about the flowers. Funny thing, there's no conference this week. You took PTO. So wherever you are, whoever you're with, hope the new lingerie is a hit. Your stuff is in storage room B12. Lock code is 4 8, 2 9. Don't come to the apartment. I changed the locks. We're done. The next morning brought 67 missed calls and endless texts. What do you mean, storage? This isn't funny. You can't just lock me out. I live there. I was planning a surprise for you. Now you destroyed it with your paranoid accusations. She called the cops. They called me. Sir, Monica Hayward says you illegally evicted her. She's not on the lease. Never was. She was a guest who lied about her whereabouts. Sounds like a civil matter. Have a good day. Then her mom called. Nathan, what is this nonsense about kicking Monica out? She lied about a work conference to cheat on me? She wasn't cheating. She was planning something special. Tuesday night, Monica's best friend Yasmin called. Monica is stranded. Her credit cards are maxed. She can't change her flight back. She was in Miami for a bachelorette party. I laughed. Whose bachelorette party? You got engaged two weeks ago. You're saying you planned a Miami bachelorette party in two weeks? Silence! Also, she told me she was at a work conference, not a surprise bachelorette party. So which lie should I believe? Wednesday morning, her dad called. Monica wasn't cheating. She was at a spa retreat for mental health. She was embarrassed to tell you.

My best friend had cancer during my job interview, a stalker during my wedding, and a miscarriage during my bridal shower, which would be tragic if any of it had been real. Cassandra and I met in middle school when she saved me from eating lunch alone in the bathroom, and from that day forward we were inseparable, until I slowly realised that every milestone in my life somehow became about her tragedy. The pattern started small in high school when I got the lead in the spring musical and she suddenly developed vocal nodes that required immediate surgery, even though she'd been singing perfectly at rehearsals the day before. When I got into my dream college, she had a mental breakdown about her parents divorce that had supposedly been finalized three years earlier and needed me to defer enrollment to through this difficult time. I went anyway, but spent my entire freshman orientation on the phone with her while she sobbed about seeing her dad with his new girlfriend, who I later found out had been his wife for five years. Then when I started dating Victor junior year, Cassandra was suddenly being stalked by her ex, who is leaving dead roses at her door and sending threatening messages from blocked numbers. I rushed home from my anniversary dinner to comfort her, only to find her calmly watching Netflix with the dead roses still in their Store wrapping with the price tag attached. When I got my first real job offer at a marketing firm in the city, the emergencies took a medical turn. The morning of my final interview, Cassandra called hyperventilating about finding a lump and needing someone to take her to the emergency room immediately because she couldn't die alone. I missed the interview to sit with her for six hours while doctors found absolutely nothing wrong. But she'd already posted about her cancer scare and raised $800 on gofundme before the ultrasound came back clear. When I confronted her about the fundraiser, she accused me of not understanding how traumatizing health scares were and kept the money for her emotional recovery expenses. Three months later, when I finally secured a different position, she developed a mysterious autoimmune condition that only flared up during my important presentations and somehow required my immediate presence. Despite her having other friends and family members available. The symptoms always miraculously disappeared by the time we reached the hospital. But not before I'd missed another crucial career moment. My engagement to Victor should have been the happiest time of my life, but Cassandra turned it into her personal tragedy showcase. The day after our engagement party, she claimed her mother had been in a severe car accident and needed emergency surgery. But when I called the hospital, they had no record of anyone by that name being admitted. During my bridal shower, she locked herself in the bathroom. Claiming she just miscarried a pregnancy nobody knew about, and made my mom drive her home while my guests sat there uncomfortably eating cake and wondering if they should leave. The week before my wedding, she outdid herself by sending fake messages from a burner phone, claiming her ex had found her new address and was planning to hurt her if she attended my wedding. She forwarded screenshots to our entire friend group and my family, creating a panic about security and whether we should involve the police. My mother actually suggested postponing the wedding for everyone's safety, while Cassandra posted messages about true friends being there during your darkest hours. I went through with my wedding anyway, and she spent the entire day posting about being abandoned during trauma and how she was hiding in her apartment in fear while everyone celebrated without her. Then after my wedding, Cassandra called me, sobbing, and for once, she sounded genuinely terrified. And so, performing her usual theatrical hysteria, she'd been diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer and needed someone to come to her oncology appointment because she was scared and alone. I stared at the phone, thinking about the fake cancer scare during my job interview and the edited medical documents she posted on social media for sympathy and the gofundme money she kept for emotional recovery expenses. She texted me photos of pathology reports and hospital wristbands, just like she had before, except this time, she swore on her mother's Life they were

So Juliana from accounting gave this amazing presentation on budget optimization last Tuesday. She'd clearly put tons of work into it. Detailed charts, creative solutions, even color coded everything. Afterward, I walked up and said, that was incredible. You should definitely present at the quarterly meeting. She smiled, thanked me, and seemed genuinely happy. Two hours later, she submitted her resignation to HR. I was completely blindsided. Did I say something wrong? I asked our mutual friend Lisa what happened. Lisa pulled me aside and said Juliana told her that someone was pushing her too hard and making her uncomfortable with unrealistic expectations. She said Juliana felt like people were setting her up to fail on purpose. I felt terrible. Was my compliment actually pressure? Was I being tone deaf? The next day, I decided to apologize. I found Juliana packing her desk. She was leaving that Friday. I walked over and said, Juliana, I'm really sorry if my comment about the quarterly meeting made you feel pressured. That wasn't my intention at all. She stopped packing and looked at me completely confused. What comment? She asked. I reminded her about the presentation compliment. Her face went pale. You. You were serious? She whispered. That's when everything came pouring out. Juliana thought I was being sarcastic. She'd been convinced for months that everyone, including me, thought she was completely incompetent at her job. She started listing examples that had Been eating at her alive. Remember three weeks ago when you said, nice job after I fixed that bed sheet error? I thought you were mocking me because it took me three tries and I held up the whole meeting. When you asked if I wanted to join the monthly planning committee, I thought it was because you wanted to watch me fail in front of everyone like some sick entertainment. Last month when I brought donuts and you said, Juliana always knows how to brighten everyone's day, I was convinced you were being fake nice because you felt sorry for me like I was the office charity case. When Tom from marketing said my quarterly report was thorough, I thought he meant it was boring and too long. I stayed up all night rewriting the next one. Remember when you invited me to that happy hour two months ago? I didn't go because I thought it was a pity invitation. Like you drew the short straw. Even when people laugh at my jokes in meetings, I assume they're laughing at me, not with me. Last week when the printer broke and you said, don't worry about it. These things happen. I thought you were being passive aggressive because I was the last one to use it. When our boss mentioned my attention to detail in the team meeting, I spent the whole night wondering what mistake I'd made. That made her feel like she had to reassure everyone. I Wasn't completely hopeless. Every single positive interaction we'd had, she'd interpreted as sarcasm, pity, or some elaborate joke at her expense. She told me she'd been having panic attacks before work, convinced that everyone was just waiting for her to mess up so they could laugh about it behind her back. She'd started eating lunch alone in her car because she was sure people were talking about her in the break room. The presentation was supposed to be her last ditch effort to prove she belonged here, that she wasn't completely useless. When I complimented it and suggested the quarterly meeting, she

My husband Levi and I have been trying for a baby for two years when I finally got pregnant, and we kept it secret because we knew our families would be absolutely insane sufferable, but gaining weight and skipping wine at dinner gave me away immediately. At my cousin's wedding, my mother in law stared at my stomach during entire conversations like she had X ray vision, casually mentioning how my face looked fuller. My sister was worse with her drink tests, literally thrusting wine glasses at me just to watch me refuse them. They formed a semi circle around me at the dessert table and my mother in law said, you're eating for two, aren't you, sweetie? My sister added, I knew it when you wore that loose dress. Easter. My aunt started crying actual tears, saying she could sense my maternal aura. Then in the middle of the reception, my mother in law stood up and announced to the entire party that she wanted to toast her future grandchild while pointing directly at my stomach. And I have never wanted to change my name and move to Canada faster. I decided these people desperately needed to learn about boundaries. I stood up slowly and put my hand on my belly. You're absolutely right, and we've been trying to figure out how to tell you about our birth plan. Everyone leaned in like hungry vultures. We're having The baby in the ocean off the coast of Maui with dolphins as midwives because the sonar waves helped develop perfect pitch and saltwater is nature's epidural. My sister's fork hit her plate with a clang that echoed through the venue. Levi jumped in perfectly with the dolphin. Doula's name is Moonbeam and she charges $10,000, but that includes placenta preparation. My mother in law's mouth opened and closed like a fish. Dolphins as midwives, she whispered. I nodded seriously and added, Moonbeam says the baby's first breath should be underwater because that's how dolphins teach their young to be fearless. The best part was watching them try to process this while maintaining supportive smiles. My aunt immediately Googled ocean birth safety and her face went from concerned to horrified as she scrolled. My sister started rambling about bacterial infections and sharks smelling blood from miles away. My mom mother in law tried. Sweetheart, that sounds unique, but have you considered a backup hospital? I responded completely deadpan that hospitals interfere with a natural dolphin bonding process. Besides, we'd already paid Moonbeam, who only accepts payment and crystals from a specific Arizona cave. She made us sign a waiver saying dolphins can't testify in court if something goes wrong. Levi added that Moonbeam had done 300 dolphin births with only a few Barracuda incidents. My cousin asked what we'd do if something went wrong. I said, that's why we chose dolphins known for their medical intuition. Plus, Moonbeam name has Essential oils blessed by shamans. Then I dropped the names. Twins would be flotsam and Jetsam. Dolfinium for a girl, Poseidon old for a boy. The entire venue went silent for two months. It was absolute psycho medical warfare. My mother in law sent daily articles about ocean bacteria with jellyfish photos and smiley emojis. My sister created a Powerpoint called why Hospital Births are natural with transition slides and handouts. My aunt secretly called my OB pretending to be me, but got caught because she didn't know my middle name. They organized an intervention with a midwife to explain why dolphins don't have medical licenses, but I insisted licenses were a human construct. It didn't apply to interspecies birthing partnerships. My wife actually Googled dolphins sonar frequencies herself. My mother in law tried booking us a surprise hospital room and cried into her salad when I refused. They got Levi's doctor brother on speakerphone during dinner. When I asked if he'd witnessed dolphin assisted birth, the silence lasted so long we thought he'd hung up. My mother in law tried bribing Moonbeam but couldn't figure.

The way he said it made my blood freeze. Missus Harra shrieked under the desks. Lights off! Move, move, move! Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. I couldn't help but think he was after me. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Missus Harra tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. Screaming got louder, and it wasn't just one voice anymore. Multiple people in different parts of the building. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that the shooter was right outside. And I believed them. Pia grabbed my hand, and her palms were soaked with sweat. I could see Mister Kids class across the hall through our door window. Lights already off. No movement. Just darkness.

Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall, pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops. Get away from the door, Daisy! Missus Harra whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Even missus Harra stood up slowly and crept to the door to check the window before opening it. That's when it flung open. The principal stood there with an actual cop who had his hand resting on his gun. You, Daisy, come with us. Immediately, my worst fear confirmed. The tutor had sent them. Or maybe they thought I was involved somehow. Missus Harra looked between them and me, confused. Get your things, honey, missus Harra said. And that scared me more than anything, because in three years of chemistry class, she'd never called me honey. Every single person was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack with shaking hands. The hallway was complete chaos, more cops than I'd ever seen. In one place, I heard a paramedic shout, we're losing him! Move! As he flew past us. My classmates were pressed against the door windows in every room, watching me get escorted by police like I was a criminal. They steered me to the main office, but passed reception into the conference room. The cop finally Spoke, your dad is here. Well, my parents are divorced, and I hadn't seen him since I was seven, so now I was really confused. Dad! He grabbed me in a hug so tight, I couldn't breathe, and his whole body shook against mine. I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. My ex marine father, who always encouraged me to be stoic and suppress my feelings, was crying his eyes out. Sorry for what? What's happening? Is there a shooter? Are people dead? I pulled back to look at him, and he held my face in both hands. His hands were freezing. There's no shooter, baby. That's when he completely broke down. There was an accident.

This happened when I was like 15 and finally got my own landline in my bedroom. I was so excited to have my own number. But three months later I started getting calls every single day asking to book golf times at Meadowbrook Country Club. At first I was nice about it. I'd pick up and be like, hey, sorry, wrong number and hang up. But these people would call back and immediately screaming that I was lying because they were calling the number right off the golf course business card. One guy called me six times in a row at seven in the morning on a Saturday, yelling that his foursome was waiting and demanding I book their tea time. So I rode my bike over to the golf course and grabbed one of their business cards from the front desk. Sure enough, my bedroom phone number was printed right there under reservations. I asked to speak to the manager and this middle aged guy in a polo shirt came out. I showed him the card and explained the problem. He looked at me like I was some dumb kid and said, that's our reservations line. We've had it for years. I pulled out my phone and said, okay then, call it right now. He refused, kept insisting it was their number. When I asked him to prove it by calling, he got all defensive and told me to leave or He'd call my parents. That's when I decided to get creative. I went home and told my mom what was happening. She was furious, but said the phone company would take weeks to fix it. So I came up with my own solution. Every time someone called asking for golf reservations, I started taking them. Meadowbrook Country Club reservations. How can I help you? I'd answer in my most professional voice. Then I'd book whatever they wanted. Wanna play at 6 a m. On a Tuesday? No problem. Party of 12 on the busiest Saturday of the month? Absolutely. Want to reserve the entire back nine for a company event? Consider it done. Within two weeks. Their Yelp reviews were a disaster. People were showing up for tee times that didn't exist. The course was completely over booked on weekends with angry golfers fighting over spots. One review said they showed up for their confirmed 6 a m. Reservation to find the course didn't even open until eight. My favorite was when this lady called wanting to book her husband's surprise birthday party for 20 people. I enthusiastically confirmed it for the exact time the court first was hosting their member championship tournament. Apparently, 50 people showed up expecting to play while the tournament was happening, and security had to get involved. Best part was listening to the manager try to explain to angry customers that their confirmed reservations weren't real. People were demanding refunds for deposits they never actually Paid some threatened to sue. The course had to comp so many free rounds to angry members. After about three months of this I got a call from the ACT

My brother inherited everything. I quietly canceled all transfers. I'm Brett, 32, and I built my contracting business from absolute zero. Started with a beat up truck and borrowed tools, working 16 hour days until my hands bled. Now I've got 12 employees and we're booked solid through next. Bring my younger brother, Bryce. Different story entirely. He's 27 and has never held a job longer than eight months. Bryce is the type who shows up to family dinners and designer clothes he can't afford, talking about his next big opportunity while I'm still wearing work boots with concrete dust on them. For the past three years, I've been automatically transferring $20,800 every month to my parents account. Mom called it helping with the mortgage during tough times. Dad mentioned rising property taxes and medical bills. I know. Never questioned it because they're my parents and twenty eight hundred dollars felt like the least I could do. But sitting in this mahogany paneled conference room listening to their estate attorney read through their will, I realized how naive I'd been. Bryce inherits the house, all investment accounts and life insurance policies, the lawyer stated. Matter of factly, Brett receives the tools in the garage and your grandmother's China set. Tools and China? After three years of mortgage payments? This seems like an oversight, I said calmly, though my chest was tightening. My mother shifted uncomfortably. Brett, Honey, Bryce needs More support than you do. You've always been so independent and successful. Bryce needs security. My father added. You've got your business, your house, your whole life figured out. Bryce is still finding his way. Finding his way at 27, after I'd started my business at 26 with nothing but determination. Can you explain what this mortgage is that I've been paying? I asked the lawyer directly. He flipped through documents. Your parents took out a 275 thousand dollar mortgage on their previously debt free home 3 years ago. Monthly payment is twenty eight hundred dollars. My stomach dropped. Their house had been paid off since I was in high school. What was the $275,000 used for? Bryce squirmed. Mom answered quickly. Bryce's Sports Bar downtown. Great location, lots of potential. His fourth business venture after the failed food truck, online clothing store, and cryptocurrency consulting company. Each funded by our parents, each ending in spectacular failure. So you took out a mortgage on your paid off house to fund Bryce's business? Had me pay that mortgage for three years without telling me. And now you're leaving everything to Bryce, including the house I've essentially been buying for him. That's very uncharitable, my mother said to tensively. I stood up slowly. You're absolutely right. I don't need your help. I never have. I walked out without another word. That evening, I sat in my home office looking at my laptop. Three clicks would cancel the automatic transfer that had been Quietly draining my business account for three years. I clicked cancel. Then I called my mortgage broker about those investment properties I've been considering. With an extra 28 dollars per month, I could easily handle the payments. Three weeks later, mom texted Brett. The mortgage payment bounced in the

My 14 year old daughter started asking to sleep over at friends houses every weekend. And I thought it was just normal teenage social stuff. But then I noticed the pattern. Every Monday morning she'd come home looking absolutely destroyed. Dark circles so deep they looked like bruises. Shoulders hunched, dragging her feet like each step hurt. When I asked about the sleepovers, she just mumbled it was fun and disappear into her room. Her math teacher emailed saying she had a panic attack during class when he'd casually asked about her weekend plans. Her violent teacher called to say she'd quit, just walked out mid lesson without explanation. She lost 10 pounds in just over a month. Her favorite jeans hung loose on her hips.

She'd get text on Friday afternoon and her whole body would change. Shoulders would tense up, face would go pale, hands would start trembling as she packed always the same overnight bag. But I noticed something odd. Work gloves sticking out of the side pocket. No more family game nights on Saturdays. No more baking cookies together on Sunday mornings. No more asking me to braid her hair before bed. It was like she was being pulled away from us by some invisible force. One day I was passing her room when I heard her on the phone. Her voice was different, scared, desperate almost. I know, I know. I'll be there, her voice cracked. I can't do this every weekend anymore. Please. A pause. No, I understand. I promise I won't tell anyone. Then I heard her crying, real gut wrenching sobs that made my chest tighten. The next morning at breakfast, I asked casually, which friend's house are you going to tonight, honey? Her spoon clattered into her cereal bowl. Her eyes darted to her phone like it might save her. Just, just Marlene's. Her mom already said yes. But I called Marlene's mom last week. Marlene had been at her dad's house in another state for the past month. That's when I really started noticing her phone behavior. When a specific notification sound played, just two quick beeps, her entire body would go rigid.

She walked like someone heading to their execution, taking a weird winding route through the neighborhood, doubling back twice, constantly checking over her shoulder. At one point, she stopped completely, stood under a streetlight, and I watched her take deep, shuddering breaths like she was preparing for battle. She pulled out her phone and typed something.

The other day I asked my best friend to hang out and he was like, sorry, I'm super sick and my parents won't let me go out. And I was like, yeah, no worries. Well, cause, I mean, that's normal, right? But then a few hours later, I open up Instagram and I'm just watching stories of people because I'm bored all damn day. Then I see his story and he's out with like 47 fucking people behind him. Mike, what do you mean about you're really sick? I didn't even bother asking him because I didn't want to argue. And the worst part, those same people are the ones who come running to me whenever they need something. And after I help them, they're like, Omg, thank you. You're literally the best friend ever. Like, bro, fuck off. Anyway, that's it. I'm out.

Walking into my ten year reunion, I knew my old teammate Chris still hated me for costing him his football scholarship. When I showed up high to the state championship, everyone remembered me as the junkie who destroyed everything senior year. They didn't know I've been clean eight years and now own 12 luxury rehab centers across the country. Chris spotted me the moment I walked in, and his face lit up with the same cruel smile I remembered from when we were teammates. He announced my arrival loud enough for half the room to hear while wrapping his arm. I'm around melody, my first love, who'd stayed beautiful despite marrying him. When I approached to say hello, Chris stepped forward and shoved me backward, just like in the locker room, my feet stumbling as he laughed and flexed his old quarterback muscles. Melody touched his arm, trying to calm him, but he was already warming up for the night ahead, gathering our former teammates with waves and shouts. Hide your wallets, everyone! The junkies here! Chris called out once he dissembled his audience, their nervous laughter encouraging him to escalate. Melody's face flushed red, but when Chris turned to high five someone, she bought my eye and mouth. I'm so sorry, her hand briefly brushing mine as she passed. Chris noticed and yanked her back to his side, waving off Her protests and turning back to me with fake concern, asking what I did for work these days. He cut me off before I could answer to announce I clean toilets at the gas station, unlike his brother, who just made partner at his law firm. The laughter growing louder seemed to remind him of something, and his eyes lit up as he pulled out his phone. The video was shaky, but clear enough to show me stumbling across the graduation stage eight years ago, my eyes unfocused as I tried to grab my diploma and nearly fell. Chris provided commentary like a sports announcer while passing his phone around, making sure everyone got a good look. At rock bottom, he explained loudly how this was why kids should stay away from substances, that some people just couldn't handle life without getting high. Melody tried to grab his phone, but he held it above her head, still playing the video on repeat until I finally escaped toward the bathroom, my face burning with memories I'd worked years to overcome. Chris's voice followed me across the ballroom, and I wasn't surprised when he pushed through the bathroom door with two former teammates cornering me by the sinks. He grabbed my wrists and yanked my sleeves up while the others watched, examining my arms like a doctor while explaining to his audience that junkies were good at hiding their marks. One of them suggested checking between my toes, and they actually debated Whether to remove my shoes before Chris finally let go, wiping his hands on his pants like I was contaminated, disgust on his face seemed to give him a new idea, and he gestured for me to follow him back out, promising the best was yet to come. Melody stood near the bar, looking miserable, and Chris's expression shifted to something crueler when he saw her. He pulled her against him, groping her in front of me while maintaining eye contact and explaining this was what real men got, not junkies, leftovers. Melody tried to squirm away, but he held her tighter, the crowds comfort fueling his performance as he announced loud enough for everyone to hear about the pregnancy scares. When melody shook her head, tears forming, Chris told me himself two times she thought she was pregnant with your kid. Thank god those babies were never born, right? Imagine having a junkie for a father. Melody broke free and ran toward the bathroom while Chris laughed at her sensitivity, then reached for a champagne glass from a passing waiter. By the time melody returned with smeared makeup, Chris had positioned himself at the center of the room with his champagne raised. He called for everyone's attention, waiting until the room quiet and all eyes turned to us, mentioning his brother couldn't make it due to a big case in California, savoring the moment like a performer about to deliver his finale.

I went through anaphylactic shock. Look at my face. Prove it. There are no nuts in his dish. You can't say that because he suffered a reaction, and it's completely reacting. Look at my face. We looked at everything. We made sure that we didn't cause any issues. May I show you the menu? Yes. What do you see on the pumpkin Alfredo? You see any nuts in pumpkin Alfredo? That is called cross contamination. Do you see what it says at the bottom of the menu? We do our best to respect dietary restrictions and allergies, but our kitchen is small, and we cannot guarantee no cross contamination. If he's telling you I'm allergic to nuts, you can always say, we can't guarantee cross contamination. You're gonna have to take your business elsewhere. If he's gonna walk around with an Epipen everywhere he goes, go eat in the hospital. He could have died. I am gonna give you $100,000 for your pain and suffering.

My family staged an intervention for Uncle Frank after he showed up to Thanksgiving dinner wearing a hazmat suit and started scanning the mashed potatoes with a device he built from an old radio. We told him he had to stop breaking into our houses in the middle of the night to check for spy cameras or we would have him arrested for trespassing. My mother was crying because he'd convinced the kids that tap water had mind control chemicals that the guy government put there to make people easier to control. And now they refuse to bathe or brush their teeth. We told Uncle Frank he was no longer welcome at family gatherings unless he got mental help for his brain gremlins. He stood up slowly, looked directly at me, and announced that when society fell apart, we would all understand. But by then, it would be too late. Uncle Frank packed up his supplies and told us that if we wanted to live in ignorance while the world burned around us, he would respect our wishes and stop trying to save people who didn't want to be saved. Three weeks later, my cousin nearly died making toast because Uncle Frank had been secretly cleaning our crumb trays monthly, claiming the government wanted house fires to happen so they could sell us smart homes with built in surveillance. Those crumbs turned her toaster into a flamethrower. That Shot fire three feet across her kitchen. A month later, raccoons came through our chimney, and my dad lost an eye wrestling one. Uncle Frank would have kept them out with the metal grates he wanted to install to block what he called government spy animals. Two weeks after that, my mother accidentally made mustard gas in our bathroom mixing cleaning supplies. Uncle Frank used to hide our chemicals and replace them with vinegar, saying corporations wanted to trick us into poisoning ourselves for population control. Two months in, my grandmother poisoned herself eating yogurt that had expired over three months ago. Uncle Frank used to throw out all of our food way before the expiration dates because he said they were fake and designed to make us sick so big farmer could profit off of us. We all laughed at him for wasting food, but that yogurt sent my grandma to the emergency room, and she was in the hospital for a week. The complete disaster happened when a massive ice storm knocked out power to the entire region for three weeks. We got our generator running for exactly two hours before it died because nobody knew it needed oil, and the engine seized up. Uncle Frank had stockpiled hundreds of batteries because he believed the government would shut down the power grid to control us. And if we still had those batteries, we could have powered our lights and heaters. He had also stored months of canned food. Because he said grocery stores were part of a conspiracy to make us dependent. That food would have kept us fed when everything spoiled if he hadn't taken it with him. We all got violently sick from drinking melted snow that was 40% dog piss. But if Uncle Frank had been there, his water purification tablets, which he claimed removed government tracking nanobots, would have made the snow safe to drink. His pile of blankets lined with what he called alien reflection technology were actually

The one that got me grounded for a month. My dad had this iron clad rule in our house. Whoever complained about dinner had to cook the next night's meal for the entire family. It was his brilliant strategy to shut us up about my stepmom Raylan's absolutely catastrophic cooking. For two solid years, nobody dared say a word. Her meatloaf could legitimately break windows. Her chicken was drier than the Sahara Desert and her famous casseroles tasted like she mixed random leftovers with sadness and baked it at 450 degrees until it surrendered. But we all just sat there choking down every bite like good little soldiers because nobody wanted to face the humiliation of trying to cover six people. Then came that unforgettable Tuesday night when Raylan decided to get creative with deconstructed tacos. I'm using air quotes here because what she actually served was literally just wilted iceberg lettuce, stone cold ground beef straight from the pan and stale hard shell tortillas that crumbled if you looked at them wrong. Everything was on separate plates like some kind of sad, depressing buffet. My ten year old sister Opal took one look at her plate, tried to eat everything and was still visibly hungry. Afterward, she started tearing up because her stomach was growling. And that's when something inside me just completely snapped. Raylan, this isn't dinner. This is what happens when a grocery store display gives up on life. The Entire dining room went dead silent. Dad's fork froze halfway to his mouth and I could practically see the gears turning in his head. Raylan's face turned bright red and my older brother Paxton was staring at me like I just signed my own death warrant. Dad slowly put down on his fork, cleared his throat and said with this smug little smile, well, congratulations, kiddo. Looks like you're cooking tomorrow night's dinner for all of us. But here's the thing dad had absolutely no clue about. For the past six months, I've been working weekend shifts at my Uncle Joseph's Italian restaurant downtown. Not just busting tables or washing dishes, but actually learning everything from knife skills to sauce preparation to proper seasoning techniques. Josway had been teaching me real cooking because he said I had natural instincts and could potentially work in professional kitchen someday. Every Saturday and Sunday, I'd spend eight hours learning how to make fresh pasta, proper marinara from scratch and authentic Italian techniques passed down through three generations. The next evening, I walked into our kitchen with a game plan. I'd stopped at the grocery store after school and bought actual fresh ingredients with my restaurant money. Real ground beef, fresh tomatoes, white onions, authentic Mexican spices, masa harina for tortillas and everything needed for proper street tacos. I spent three hours hand pressing corn tortillas, slow cooking carnitas until they were fall apart tender, making fresh PICO de Gallo with perfectly diced ingredients. Crafting homemade salsa Verde.

I faked being broke after winning the lottery to see who'd stick around. Last month, I won 2.4 million on a scratch off at the gas station near my apartment. The cashier congratulated me. I signed the back, took the photo with the giant check, the whole thing. But instead of celebrating, I had this sinking feeling about what would happen when my family found out. See, I'd always been the one they called when they needed money. Car repairs, rent, medical bills. I was their personal ATM. But I'd never been in real trouble myself, so I didn't know if they'd return the favor. So I decided to test them. I locked the lottery ticket in a safety deposit box and started my performance. First, I called out sick from my warehouse job for a week, then told everyone I'd been fired for attendance issues, budget cuts. I said, last hired, first fired. Then I started the money complaints. Rent was due, bank account was empty, unemployment wouldn't kick in for weeks. I sold my PlayStation, my bike. Anything that looked valuable. Made it look desperate. The reactions were brutal and immediate. My sister Ashley, who I'd helped with three different car payments, stopped inviting me to family dinners. We can't afford extra mouths right now, she said when I asked about Sunday dinner. Maybe when you get back on your feet. My brother Alex, whose entire college Tuition I'd covered when our parents couldn't suddenly never answered my calls. When he finally texted back, it was always busy with work or I can't talk right now. This from the guy who used to call me twice a week. My parents were the worst. They suggested I move back into my childhood bedroom, but wanted me to pay them $800 a month rent. It'll teach you responsibility, dad said. Maybe this is the wake up call you needed. Meanwhile, my elderly neighbour Margaret, who I barely knew beyond polite hallway conversations, started showing up with groceries. Everyone needs help sometimes, she said, refusing to let me pay her back. Just help someone else when you can. My coworker Steve from the warehouse offered to cover my lunch every day. We weren't even that close. Just work friends who talked about sports. You do the same for me, he said. When I protested. Guy at my corner Bodega, Omar, started letting me take coffee for free. You always tip good when you have money, he said. Coffee is cheap, friendship isn't. Even my mailman noticed something was wrong. You usually order packages, Miguel said. Everything okay when I explained he brought me leftovers from his wife's cooking. Food shouldn't be wasted. After two months of watching, my family completely abandoned me, while virtual strangers showed more kindness than I'd ever experienced, I was done with the experiment. I called a family meeting at my apartment. Everyone came, probably expecting Me to ask for money again. Ashley brought her husband for backup. Alex looked annoyed to be there. My parents sat with their arms crossed like they were about to deliver bad news. I walked into the living room wearing my lottery winner T-shirt.

And when I asked what she said, she told the teacher that 2 + 2 wasn't 5. At first I thought she was being a smart mouth kid, but then I realized she was dead serious. She explained to me that her math teacher, Missus Cooper, was having them do basic edition problems on the board. And when she asked the class what 2 + 2 was, Mia raised her hand and said 4. The teacher shook her head and said, no, today we're learning that 2 + 2 = 5 and wrote it on the whiteboard. My daughter sat there confused for a second, then raised her hand again and said, but that's wrong. Two plus 2 is four. It's always been 4. Mrs. Cooper apparently got annoyed and told her to stop disrupting the class, but Mia kept insisting that the math was wrong. Finally the teacher snapped and said, young lady, you're being disrespectful to your teacher. I'm writing you up. I thought this had to be some kind of misunderstanding. So I called the school the next morning. The principal, Mister Davis, confirmed that, yes, my daughter had received detention for arguing with her teacher about basic math. When I explained that 2 + 2 actually is 4, he got quiet for a moment. Then he said something that made my blood boil. Well, Missus Cooper has been teaching for 15 years. I'm sure she knows What she's doing, maybe your daughter should learn to respect authority instead of always thinking she knows better. I hung up and drove straight to the school. I marched into the principal's office and demanded to speak with Missus Cooper immediately. When she came in, I asked her Point Blank to explain why she was teaching kids that 2 + 2 equals five. He looked at me like I was the crazy one and said it was a lesson about following instructions and respecting your teacher. Sometimes in life you have to accept what authority figures tell you, even if you think they're wrong. I stared at her for a full 10 seconds before I lost it. I told her that teaching kids to accept obviously wrong information from authority figures was basically training them to be victims, that math isn't a matter of opinion or respect, it's facts. The principal tried to back her up, saying it was about teaching respect and following directions. I pulled out my phone and started recording. I asked them both to state for the camera that they believed 2 + 2 = 5 and that student should accept incorrect information from teachers without question. They both clammed up real quick when they realized I was recording. Missus Cooper started backtracking, saying it was just a teaching exercise and that she never meant for it to go this far. I told them I was pulling my daughter out of that class.

I let him copy something that destroyed his digestive system forever. Ever since our divorce two years ago, my ex husband Robbie turned eating into psychological warfare. Whenever we ended up at the same in restaurant, he'd wait until I order then tell the server he wanted exactly what I was having but slip them $20 to make his plate look better than mine like he was winning some competition I never entered. The first time at a steakhouse downtown, he held up his identical rib eye and announced to his date that his special medium rare was clearly the superior choice for sophisticated palettes. It started with him showing up at my favorite brunch spot every Sunday, ordering my exact omelette while sitting two tables away making loud comments about how eggs represent new beginnings. Then it escalated to him appearing at my birth, a dinner with my sister, ordering my exact seafood pasta and telling our mutual friends that he invented that specific modification with extra capers back when we were married. It took me a while to realize that I never stopped sharing my phone location with him. So he just show up unannounced at any random public place I happen to be eating at. He crashed my promotion Celebration at a sushi place, ordered my exact terashi bowl and gave a toast about how proud he was that I finally reached the level he Always knew I could achieve with proper motivation. But the moment that broke me happened at my father's wake when Robbie ordered the exact comfort food plate I'd gotten and told my grieving mother, grief makes everything taste better because it reminds you you're alive. My aunt literally gasped when he said it, and my mother just stared at him while holding her untouched sandwich like she couldn't process what she just heard. He needed to be put in his place and I needed the perfect the plan. A few weeks ago, I was having dinner at a new upscale gastropub when Robbie walked in with a woman who looked young enough to be his graduate student and her parents, who were dressed like they'd expected a country club. He went for something to the hostess while sliding her a 50 and got seated directly in my line of sight, despite the restaurant being mostly empty. When the server came to my table, I watched Robbie lean forward to hear what I was ordering. I looked up at the challenge menu on the wall advertising the Reaper's last meal, the Carolina Reaper Wing Challenge I've been secretly training for ever since discovering this place three months ago, right after he ruined my father's wake. I knew from our marriage that Robbie had zero spice tolerance, but his ego would never let him back down from a challenge. And I've been building my spice tolerance with ghost peppers and pure capsaicin Drops specifically for this moment. I told the server in my sweetest voice that I've been preparing for the Reaper's last meal for months and handed over my credit card for the deposit while Robbie's eyes got wider than I'd ever seen them during our entire marriage. Robbie immediately flagged down our server and announced he wanted the exact same challenge, but demanded they bring extra sauce on the side because he'd been eating spicy food since before I even knew what flavor was. And his date's parents exchanged concerned looks while she giggled about how competitive divorced couples were so entertaining. The entire restaurant stopped eating when the cook came out personally to. We understood that the last person who attempted this challenge had to be carried out on a stretcher. And Robbie signed his waiver with a flourish while telling the cook to make sure he got that extra sauce because he didn't want anyone thinking we were equally capable. The wings arrived looking like they've been dipped in radioactive lava, and the smell alone made three nearby tables asked to be moved immediately. I picked up my first wing and took a measured bite while controlling my breathing exactly like I'd practiced for months, feeling the burn but managing it with a technique I'd perfected. Robbie grabbed his wing and board.

I came home early and found my mom in bed with Mister Lowell, my AP chemistry teacher who's married with three kids. I stood frozen in the doorway feeling like I was about to vomit. Her blazer was draped over the lamp and his dress shirt lay inside out on the floor. This smell of his Cologne, the same one that made me gag in chemistry class, was now contaminating my mother's bedroom. Mr Lowell ran past me, clutching his pants while his pale chest showed scratch marks. And my mother wrapped herself in a sheet with her face completely drained of color. Please let me explain, she said, with tears streaming down her face as she reached toward me with shaking hands. How could you, I screamed and backed into the hallway. He's my teacher. His wife goes to your book club. My mother sat on the bed and put her head in her hands while her whole body trembled. I had no choice. Every one has a choice about who they sleep with, I said as my voice cracked. Mom said, Mr Lowell has been selling pills to students at your school. My face dropped. What? Fentanyl, sweetheart? Xanax, Adderall. Three kids have overdosed this semester alone. I stared at her and tried to process this. So you decided to have an affair with him? How does that make any sense? Even if he was, why wouldn't you just call the police? My mother stood on unsteady legs and walked to her closet. She pulled out a box from the top shelf with trembling hands. Inside were photos, recording devices and documents with FBI letterhead. My blood went cold when I looked at surveillance photos of my chemistry teacher in dark parking lots. Mr Lowell isn't just some teacher selling pills on the side, she said, while her voice broke. He's part of a major operation. They're using teachers in five districts because no one suspects educators. She sat back down and looked older than I'd ever seen her. The FBI recruited me six months ago because I had access to him through school events. I was just supposed to gather information at PTA meetings, but he wouldn't talk business unless we got closer. Tears were running down her face. Now, one of the kids who overdosed died last month. You remember. He was 14 years old. His little sister found his body. I remembered his memorial where his parents sobbed uncontrollably. His little sister had to be carried out of the auditorium while the rest of us wore purple ribbons. Does dad know? I whispered. No one knows except my handler. She looked destroyed. Not even your father knows. Because if anyone knew, the whole operation would collapse. We spread photos across the bed showing Mister Lowe meeting teachers and parking garages. Text messages using code words were visible alongside A spreadsheet of student names with prices that made me sick. These were kids I knew and sat next to in class. They target specific students, she said, while showing me their notes. Kids with divorced parents, kids with anxiety about college and foster kids are all marked. They know exactly who's vulnerable. She pulled out another document while their hands shook worse. Now they're expanding to middle schools and planning to recruit 8th graders as dealers. Brother's friend Bram is on their list. I felt my stomach drop thinking about Bram, who played video games at our house every weekend. He still wore superhero shirts and collected Pokemon cards. Look at his file, she said. Single mom who works nights and they're behind on rent. They know exactly what to offer him. They've been watching him for months and documenting his routine. She showed me more files detailing five kids who died from overdoses in two years, with all deaths made to look accidental or like suicides. Teachers were discussing doses in group texts like they were talking about homework.

I just wanted a break from her texting me 24 7 and having to assure her that I wasn't going to leave her. But the counselor said I looked sick and immediately took me to the nurse. When they saw that I weighed 98 pounds at 13 years old, their faces changed. We need to call your mother, the nurse said, looking at my vitals with concern. But I panicked instantly. Please don't call her. She'll pull me out of school. The counselor sat down and asked why would she do that? She told me that she can't live without me, that she needs me. But she also said that others can't know about the texts. I showed them my phone and I swear it was like the room temperature dropped. These aren't normal. How long has your mother been sending these? Since dad left two years ago. She told me this was normal for a mother and her son. So I never said anything. The counselor called the principal and then the police, even though I begged her not to. A police officer arrived and read through months of messages while I sat there terrified of what mom would do when she found out. My chest felt like it was being crushed. Why do you have banking apps on your phone? I handle all the bills. Because mom says looking at numbers gives her panic. Attacks. You're 13 years old and you're managing household finances. Someone has to pay rent and buy groceries or we'd be evicted. The weight of saying it out loud made me realize how exhausted I was. The counselor pulled up my records on her computer. The officer had me show him a typical day of messages. My hand shook as I scrolled to yesterday and started reading them out loud. Good morning, my soulmate. You're the only reason I'm alive. Don't leave me alone today. If you go to school, I'll have no reason to keep living. You're more of a man than your father ever was. Why aren't you responding? I'm taking all my pills. Never mind, I threw them up. Please come home. You're the only person who truly loves me. We have a special bond no one understands. Each word felt like glass in my throat. The officer stopped me. He calls you her soulmate every day since dad left. Does she tell you adult problems? She tells me about her dates, which men she thinks are attractive, her financial problems, everything. The room started slightly. When did you last have a full night sleep? I couldn't remember because mom would wake me up at all hours to talk about how lonely she was. Sometimes crawling into my bed crying about dad leaving. When they called mom to the school, she arrived already screaming and crying. Before she even got to the office, the sound of her Voice made me physically flinch. You're trying to steal my baby. He's all I have left in this world. She grabbed my arm so hard it hurt, her nails digging into my skin. Tell them how much you love taking care of me. Tell them about our special bond that no one else understands. The counselor tried to stay calm, but I could see her jaw clenching. Ma'am, your son weighs 98 pounds because he's not eating. He's failing every class and he's managing your entire emotional and financial life. He's mature for his age. He wants to help me. We're soulmates. The word hung in the air like poison and everyone went silent. I mean, we have a special bond. He understands me like no one else ever has. The officer spoke up. You just called your 13 year old son your soulmate. That completely inappropriate. Mom turned on me with tears streaming down her face, but her eyes were wild with rage. After everything I've sacrificed for you, I stayed alive when I wanted to die. Your father abandoned us and I could have.

I was video calling my brother Logan about coming home for Easter break when he said something that made my blood run cold. Our sister Grace had gotten into a massive fight with our parents about dropping out of nursing school, and when dad threatened to cut her off, she blurted out that at least she wasn't hiding being gay like I was. She showed them photos from my private Instagram and told them I've been recruiting our youngest sister, Anna, to the lifestyle. She told them I've been laughing at their beliefs behind their backs and that she tried to check them from knowing what their daughter really was. Mom cried while dad locked himself in his office, and Grace spent the next hour comforting mom and positioning herself as a good daughter. I drove home immediately and went straight to Logan's house. Anna was there, too, crying because Grace had been telling mom she found gay content on Anna's phone, suggesting I'd corrupted her, too. My brother told me Grace was already working on getting power of attorney over our grandmother's estate. By convincing everyone I couldn't be trusted with family matters anymore. We realized Grace had been doing this for years. Like when she blamed Anna for getting pregnant in high school when really Grace needed abortion money. Or when she said Logan stole from the church fundraiser when Grace took the cash spring break. Then Logan showed me Grace's Instagram, proving she'd been lying about nursing school for the entire semester, posting pictures and scrubs she never wore to clinics that didn't exist while our parents paid 30,000 tuition for classes she wasn't attending. Anna found Grace's Venmo history showing she'd spent the tuition on concerts and Miami trips while sending our parents fake grade reports she'd made in Photoshop. Logan's girlfriend who worked at the registrar's office confirmed Grace was expelled for paying someone to take her anatomy exam two months ago, not voluntarily dropping out like she'd claimed. We found emails where Grace was trying to get loans using our parents information without their knowledge. Already approved for $50,000 that would post next week. Ace had been bragging to friends about destroying my relationship with our parents, calling me a self righteous bitch who deserved to be disowned and saying she'd make sure I never saw inheritance money. She'd actually researched whether sexual orientation could be used to contest wills in our state, and was disappointed when she found out it couldn't. We discovered she'd been intercepting mail to hide credit card statements, showing she'd been using Mom's emergency card for thousands in purchases at designer stores. We found forged checks from Dad's business account, stolen credit card statements, and proof Grace had been selling our dead grandfather's belongings on marketplace while telling our parents she was organizing his estate. She'd made $20,000 selling his watch. Collection and wore memorabilia that was supposed to stay in the family forever. My brother found text messages where Grace was negotiating to sell grandma's jewelry while she was still alive in hospice, telling buyers she'd have the pieces soon.

Is Daisy Williams present in school today? My teacher, Missus Harra, clicked the intercom button. Yes. The principal's voice echoed, lockdown, now! This is not a drill. The way he said it made my blood freeze. Missus Harra shrieked under the desks. Lights off! Move, move, move! Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. I couldn't help but think he was after me. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Missus Harra tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. Screaming got louder, and it wasn't just one voice anymore. Multiple people in different parts of the building. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that the shooter was right outside. And I believed them. Pia grabbed my hand, and her palms were soaked with sweat. I could see Mister Kids class across the hall through our door window. Lights already off. No movement. Just darkness. Where 20 kids should have been. I looked at our teacher, and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids, and told us it would be okay. But after a while, she Got up again and walked back to her laptop. Then we heard it. Footsteps running past our door. Thud! Thud, thud! I couldn't help myself. I had to look. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall, pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops. Get away from the door, Daisy! Missus Harra whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Even missus Harra stood up slowly and crept to the door to check the window before opening it. That's when it flung open. The principal stood there with an actual cop who had his hand resting on his gun. You, Daisy, come with us. Immediately my worst fear confirmed. The tutor had sent them. Or maybe they thought I was involved somehow. Missus Harra looked between them and me, confused. Get your things, honey, missus Harra said. And that scared me more than anything, because in three years of chemistry class, she'd never called me honey. Every single person was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack with shaking hands. The hallway was complete chaos, more cops than I'd ever seen. In one place, I heard a paramedic shout, we're losing him! Move! As he flew past us. My classmates were pressed against the door windows in every room, watching me get escorted by police like I was a criminal. They steered me to the main office, but passed reception into the Conference room. The cop finally spoke. Your dad is here? Well, my parents are divorced, and I hadn't seen him since I was seven. So now I was really confused. Dad! He grabbed me in a hug so tight, I couldn't breathe. And his whole body shook against mine. I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. My ex marine father, who always encouraged me to be stoic and suppress my feelings, was crying his eyes out. Sorry for what? What's happening? Is there a shoe

Jess came over to my place Friday night and I could tell something was bothering her by the way she kept sighing. You know what Britney told me today? She said, flopping down on my couch. Her boyfriend is so mysterious and she's obsessed with him. Meanwhile, you texted me 12 times about being nervous for your presentation. The way she said it made me feel like I was some kind of burden. I wish you were more mysterious, more of a challenge. I should have known this would end badly when three weeks later she'd be crying at my door. But that night I just felt hurt and said, fine, I'll be mysterious that night. I usually would have texted her good night, but I didn't and it felt wrong not doing it. She sent me three question marks right away and I just wrote back, all good and left it at that. Saturday morning came and normally I'd text her about my coffee and ask what she was up to, but I kept my phone in my pocket. By noon, she was texting you okay? And I just sent a thumbs up, which killed me because I actually wanted to talk to her. Monday was the worst because I got the promotion I've been working for and all I wanted was to call her and celebrate when we went to dinner. That night she asked about my day and I just said, same old while scrolling through my phone, even though inside I was bursting to tell her. She leaned across the table trying to figure out what was going on with me. You seem different, she said. Good, different. And the crazy part was she seemed more into me than she had in months. She made me feel powerful but also completely hollow inside. The second week, she started showing up at my place without calling first and cooking these fancy dinners, basically doing anything to crack me open. I can't figure you out anymore, she said. Wednesday night, and she sounded excited about it. Britney's so jealous, she says. I got the mysterious boyfriend Jackpot. I wanted to tell her how dumb this whole thing was and how much I missed just talking to her normally, but I just shrugged and kept watching TV. Friday, my dad called because my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery and he was freaking out. I spent three hours calming him down while just sat next to me trying to figure out what was happening. After I hung up, she asked, is everything okay? And I wanted to fall into her arms and tell her everything, family, stuff. I said instead, it's handled. She kissed me harder than she had in months and whispered, you're so strong. But I wasn't strong at all. I was just pretending. The third Thursday night, At eleven PM, Jess showed up at my door with her makeup running down her face, shaking so bad she could barely stand. My mom had a heart attack, she sobbed, falling into my arms. She's in surgery. They don't know if she'll make it. My whole.

I'm the proudest mom ever. I got called to the police station at 6:00am because my eleven year old Mia had destroyed all three district buses with bolt cutters she taken from my garage. When I arrived at the station, Mia was sitting in the chief's office with grease under her fingernails from the brake fluid. The principal was there screaming about expulsion and pressing criminal charges, while our longtime bus driver, Mr. Wilson, stood by the door shaking his head in disappointment. I can't believe sweet little Mia would do this, Mr. Wilson said, putting on his concerned grandfather act. Such a good girl. Usually. I've driven her since kindergarten, given her candy on her birthday. Now the whole fifth grade misses their mountain field trip because of her vandalism. The depot manager showed photos on his phone of cut brake lines dripping fluid. This is two hundred thousand dollars in damages. Someone has to pay for this destruction. Mia, what did you do? I asked, feeling sick that my quiet daughter, who helps me in my mechanic shop every weekend, had done something so destructive. I stopped Mister Wilson from killing 30 kids, Mia said, staring straight at him. The room went completely silent. Mister Wilson laughed, but it sounded nervous and forced. Kids say the craziest things when they're in trouble. She's obviously making up stories to avoid consequences. You drink vodka every morning before driving? Us to school, Mia said clearly. My stomach dropped to the floor while the principal said, that was a very serious accusation to make. I see him filling his thermos from a vodka bottle in his truck, Mia continued. Every single morning for months. He parks behind the depot, thinking nobody can see him. But I walk past there to school. That's something you should have told adults immediately, the chief said sternly. I told the principal last month. He said I was mistaken and missed her. Wilson just drank strong coffee. The principal's face went red. You couldn't have been sure what you saw from that distance. I know what vodka bottles look like. Mom keeps them in the garage to clean engine parts. I help her every weekend. This was true because I taught her that trick for decreasing. My hands were shaking thinking about my daughter and son on a bus with a drunk driver. Every single morning for months. All those mornings. I waved goodbye as she on that bus, trusting she was safe. I said, Mia, why didn't you tell me? She just looked at me and said, I didn't want to bother you when you're really busy at work. And my heart broke. She's obviously lying to save herself, Mr. Wilson said, but sweat was dripping down his face. Now I have videos, Mia said, pulling out her phone. Here's you drinking in your truck yesterday morning. Here's you stumbling to the bus last Week. Here's you swerving into oncoming traffic Tuesday, with kids screaming in the back. The chief took her phone and his face went pale watching the footage. Jesus Christ! This is from three days ago. He's clearly intoxicated with children on board. I wanted to vomit right there. These videos don't prove anything, Mister Wilson said desperately, his voice getting higher. And there's something else, too, Mia said. Everyone stared at her. She showed us the weather alert on her phone from last night. Flash freeze overnight with black ice warnings for all mountain roads. The field trip was still scheduled. Today's route goes straight down Devil's Pass, has 30 degree grades and turns that kill sober drivers. With black ice everywhere and Mister Wilson drunk, our bus would go straight off the cliff. My little brother and 29 other kids would die today. That's pure speculation, the principal said weakly. But he was staring at Mister Wilson. Now, yesterday I heard Mister Wilson tell another driver he wasn't canceling for the bad weather because he needed the

I was in sixth grade when my friend Jake figured out our school was literally cheating on state tests. It started during one of those super boring testing weeks where they make you sit in silence for, like, three hours straight with just two pencils and a water bottle. Jake was always the type to notice weird stuff. On the second day of testing, he whispered to me that his answer booklet already had light pencil marks filled in. I thought he was being paranoid, but when I looked down at mine, I saw the same thing. Faint pencil marks in what looked like the right bubbles. We weren't the only ones. This girl Ashley in front of us had marks, too. And Tommy, who sat by the window. Jake raised his hand and told Missus Garcia about it. She got this super fake smile and collected all our booklets, saying there must have been some mistake. Next day, we got brand new ones with no marks. But Jake's older brother Nick, was in eighth grade, and he told us the exact same thing happened to his class the year before. He said some teachers always whispered about not wanting to fail the district again. That got us thinking, so Jake and I came up with this plan. We decided to mess up some answers on purpose in a specific pattern that we both agreed on. Like we'd both put B for question 15, when we knew it was C, and we'd both put A for question 23, when the answer was obviously D. When our test results came back weeks later, every single answer was marked correct. Even the ones we knew we got wrong on purpose. Every single one. That's when Jake told his mom, who worked at this tutoring place downtown. She got suspicious and filed some kind of formal complaint with the district, asking to see our actual answer sheets. Turns out hundreds of tests from our school had been erased and filled in with the right answers. Like, with actual erasers and pencils. The district started this huge investigation. Teachers were getting called into meetings, kids were being interviewed. The whole school felt tense. For weeks, nobody knew what was happening, but rumors were flying everywhere. Then it all came out. Our principal, Missus Webb, had been ordering teachers to fix student tests before sending them to the state. If they refused, they'd get bad performance reviews or lose money from after school programs they helped with. Some teachers admitted they'd been doing it for years because they were scared of losing their jobs. Missus Webb apparently did it to keep the school's funding and make tests.

My girlfriend Molly put her hand under my desk and. Please, Mrs. Dotson, you have to legally let us go. Mrs. Hy Dotson was crying now, with mascara running down her cheeks. I'm sorry, but if I let you all run out of the class, the gunman might get you. We need to wait. I looked at Molly and tried to keep my voice steady. Don't worry, babe. I'm going to figure out a way out of this. Missus Dodson had kept our entire class trapped in the room. She'd been acting strange all week, but today she locked the door during last period because she sensed a warning. Missus Dodson suddenly screamed and pointed at the door. There! Did you hear those gunshots? Everyone get down! We all looked at each other confused, but Missus Dodson was shaking and clutching a rosary to her chest. She heard it all 20 of us to the back corner of the room, furthest from the windows. She started praying in Latin while we huddled together. Some kids were crying. Others were texting their parents frantically. The school had probably already called, wondering where we were. Basketball practice had started two hours ago. Drama rehearsal was happening without half the cast. This is Dotson. I have an idea, I said, interrupting her prayer. How about you let us out through the window? Since we're Only on the first floor, and we can all escape and get help. She shook her head violently. No. The government has friends outside. They'll shoot all of you the second you climb out. I won't let you leave. Started going around hugging each student and telling them she loved them. Kids were flinching away from her touch. This woman, who usually graded papers with perfect posture, was now wild eyed and sweating through her cardigan. Bradley was the class troublemaker who usually slept through lessons. He stood up and crossed his arms. Missus Watson, you're so insane that you make me want to actually do my homework. Let us out, you crazy witch! School dismissal was four hours ago. Her face twisted into something ugly. The only dismissal you're going to have is straight to hell. Let you out of the classroom and let the gunman unload on you. Fine, then let's do it. Bradley walked toward the door. Missus Dodson immediately crumbled. I'm sorry, sweetie. You know I can't let you leave here. I have to keep the door locked so I can protect you all. While she was focused on Bradley and trying to pull him back to the group, I saw my chance. Her keys were hanging from her belt loop. I carefully reached over and unclip them, trying not to jingle the metal. Molly saw what I was doing and created more distraction by fake crying loudly. I crawled toward the door, staying low like We were actually in danger. I didn't realize till later that we really were. My hands were shaking as I found the right key. The clicked open and I yanked the door handle. Run! I shouted. All 20 students rushed for the door at once. Missus Dawson screamed and tried to grab people, but we pushed past her. We ran down the hallway and burst through the front entrance into the parking lot, where police cars were everywhere. The cops had their hands on their weapons until they saw it was just a bunch of terrified teenagers. They immediately asked us what happened. Teacher went insane and trapped us in there for four hours, I told the nearest officer. He nodded grimly. We're sorry we took so long. We just got the call about you guys after we searched in missus Dodson's house. You won't believe what we found. Full story on channel link below.

I took the business with me. My brothers Matthew and Aaron started a wedding photography business after watching some videos about easy money in weddings. They bought 20 K worth of cameras and lenses, printed fancy business cards, and figured they were set. The problem was, clients expect same day social media posts with perfect filters, instant photo sharing during the reception, automated slideshow displays, and so on. My brothers could barely figure out how to transfer photos from their cameras. After six months of disasters, they begged me to help. Since I'm a software engineer. Just set up a simple website where clients can view photos. Matthew said, how hard could it be? What I actually built over the next 18 months was absolutely insane. I built real time gallery systems that upload and organize photos during the actual wedding so guests can see highlights on their phones before the reception ends. I programmed automated slideshow displays that update live during reception, showing edited highlights from the ceremony that just happened. I spent two years perfecting every detail. Their payment for all this work was letting me photograph their friends weddings for a portfolio experience and promising me a partnership. Once things got more established, they paid me an exposure and leftover wedding cake. Here's what they didn't know. I'm not an idiot. I trademarked all the software, registered the algorithms as intellectual property, and licensed everything to their LLC through my Own development company. Every single system ran through my servers using my code. The business exploded. They went from struggling to book 500 dollar weddings to charging $8,000 per event. Last month they landed their absolute dream client. A $50,000 celebrity wedding for some reality TV star with 3 million Instagram followers. The contract included social media deliverables, live posting requirements, and a same day highlight reel for the bride's Instagram. Suddenly I went from indispensable tech partner to just the tech guy who works in the background. They started talking about streamlining operations and reducing overhead costs. They hired Matthew's girlfriend as a creative director and Aaron's buddy as a business development manager. Yesterday at 3 p. M. I got the text in our group chat. We held a meeting and decided we're going in a new direction. The business doesn't need a full time tech person anymore. Clear out your stuff by Friday. We'll Venmo you for the laptop. I stared at that. Then I replied with one word okay. At three o five PM, I logged into my AWS console and shut down their entire digital infrastructure. Everything now displayed a simple message service temporarily unavailable. Contact system administrator. The celebrity wedding was scheduled for the next stay. By three thirty PM, my phone started buzzing. Matthew called twice. Then Aaron called, then Matthew again. The real fun started at 6:00am the next morning.

In my group, I was always the ugly friend. That was the joke, at least. While they were all athletes, football players, basketball stars, gym guys, I was the skinny kid with glasses who preferred games and movies to the gym. They never let me forget it. They joked I'd never get a girlfriend. Tried setting me up with their nerdy cousin. Even suggested I should try boys instead since girls were out of my league. One of them once made a tinder profile under my name. The bio looks don't matter. Personality is what counts. Like I was some charity project. At parties it was worse. They nudged me toward whoever they thought was the least attractive girl there, laughing, don't worry, he's funny once you get to know him. On the surface, I laughed with them, but deep down, it's done. To them, I wasn't a real option. I was the comic relief. Then came the night that flipped everything. We went out to a brand new bar downtown. Place was packed. The kind of spot people posted about just to prove they were there. The second we walked in, everyone noticed her. A waitress weaving through the crowd like the room revolved around her. Gorgeous, confident, effortless. My friends lit up, nudging each other like they just spotted at a prize that I get her number first. No chance. She's into tall guys. Relax, I already Called dibs. Even the host smirked when we asked for her. She's the most requested waitress we've got. If you want her table, you'll have to wait. So we waited 40 minutes just so she would be the one to serve us. While we waited, the old routine started. Don't scare her off, man. We'll pay you not to talk when she comes. They flexed, adjusted their shirts, hype themselves up. I sat there, quiet. I'd heard it all before. Finally, she appeared, tray balanced in one hand, smile lighting up the whole place. My friend straightened instantly, ready to turn on the charm. But then she spotted me. Her face lit up. Baby, you came. Before anyone could react, she set the tray down, ran straight to me and threw her arms around my neck. She kissed me, sat on my lap and hugged me like she hadn't seen me in weeks. The bar noise kept going, but at our table, silence. Absolute silence. She looked around at the others, laughing. You didn't tell them? I just shrugged. Didn't think it was important. The guys looked like someone had unplugged their brains. Mouth open, drinks half raised, muscles still flexed like mannequins. This waitress, the one they've been drooling over, the one they bet on, had been my girlfriend for almost a year. They didn't know because I know. I told them honestly. I didn't want to hear their jokes about how I must have tricked someone into dating Me? She leaned against me, chatting casually like we weren't blowing their minds. I rubbed her back, trying not to smirk. Meanwhile, my friends scrambled to recover. One stammered, wait, seriously? Since when? Another muttered, bro, we were just kidding around. Suddenly the same guys who teased me for years were backpedaling, trying to apologize, insisting they didn't mean it like that. But it was too late. The image they built of me, the charity case, the ugly friend, the one they pitied, was shattered in a single moment. The girl everyone in that bar wanted had already chosen me months ago, without hesitation.

My bully made fun of me so much that he triggered a school shooting lockdown. It all started when I was sitting alone in the cafeteria. TJ grabbed my free lunch tray and tossed it into the trash can, as 30 kids watched him literally take food out of a poor kid's mouth for entertainment. Oops. Guess you'll have to wait for food stamps. But whenever I told my parents about it, it was always the same response. Please just stop causing trouble. You see, his parents owned half the businesses in town, including the diner where both my parents worked double shifts. Standing up for myself meant getting evicted. And he knew this all too well. But on that same Tuesday, TJ had something special planned. We were in Miss Louise's history class when she got called to the office. DJ immediately spun around you. Food stamps? Where's your friends at? I was just staring at my Chromebook, pretending I didn't exist, but my hands were already doing that shaky thing. He started going through my stuff like he owned the place. That's when he found it. The photo tucked inside my notebook of me and my mom at her citizenship ceremony. Her proudest moment. Oh, my gosh. Held it up. Is this your mom? Look at her crying. He started doing this exaggerated fake Chinese accent. I so happy to be American. I clean toilet real good. Now the whole class went dead silent. Give good happy ending. I Learned from my son. My face was going red. What's wrong? TJ grinned. Can't take a joke? Maybe that's why your dad drinks so much. I drink too, if. Shut up. Oh, he speaks. Hey, everyone! The yellow poverty boy found his voice. He pulled out his phone number. Not this. It was a video from his dad's diner. My mom was cleaning tables at 2:00am, and some drunk customer yelled at her. She was just taking it, nodding, apologizing for something that wasn't even her fault. Anything to keep putting food on our table. TJ, turn the volume all the way up. Yes, sir. So sorry, sir. I fix right away, sir. I could hear her exhaustion, see her shoulders sagging. The whole class was watching my mother get humiliated in high definition. That was when I noticed the red button under Miss Louise's desk. Your whole family is pathetic, Jay continued. At least my parents own things instead of cleaning them. Something inside me went quiet. The shaking stopped. You know what, TJ? You're right. You're so much braver than me. He blinked. Obviously so brave that you do anything right. Not like scared little me. What are you talking about, you freak? I leaned back, weirdly calm. Now there's a button under Loose's desk. Red one. So? So press it. The room went still. Why would I? Because you won't. All that tough guy stuff. It's just daddy's money. Take that away and you're nothing. Too scared to press one little button? His face went red. I'm not scared of anything. Prove it. That's stupid. That's what I thought. I turned away. Guess the Littleson family was all talk. Your dad acted tough at the diner, too, but everyone knew he was just. TJ slammed his hand on my desk. Shut your mouth about my family! He stormed over to Miss Louise's desk. The whole class held their breath. His finger hovered over it. This is what actual courage looks like, he announced. Click! For 10 seconds, nothing. TJ started laughing. You're so pathetic, you. We. Oh, we. Oh. Police sirens. They were heading straight towards us. The principal's voice exploded over the intercom. Lockdown! This is not a drill.

You get nothing when we die. Then Grandma's lawyer called. The call came while I was eating cereal before my shift at the auto parts store. Austin Caldwell? This is Margaret Stevens, estate attorney. Your grandmother Eleanor left you something. I almost laughed. There's been a mistake. My parents said I wasn't in her will. Mister Caldwell, we need to meet immediately. Two hours later, I'm staring at documents. $2.1 million a house, investment accounts. All mine. But I'm adopted, I stammered. Margaret handed me a letter in Grandma's handwriting. Austin, you are not adopted. You're my biological grandson. Your father's first wife, Jennifer, was your real mother. She died when you were two. Susan made David pretend you were adopted because she wanted you gone. My hand shook. 21 years of being treated like garbage while my siblings got cars and vacations. I work two jobs just to afford ramen. Every family dinner where they just. Just college funds for Logan and Ashley. But when I asked about help with community college, dad would say, you need to learn independence. The letter continued, David and Susan think they're inheriting everything. They've been spending money they don't have. The new truck, kitchen remodel, Logan's boat. They borrowed against my estate. They get nothing. But there was more. Margaret pulled out another folder. Your grandmother hired a private investigator three years ago. She documented everything. Photos of me walking to work in the rain. Because my Bike broke. Screenshots of my parents social media posts bragging about their inheritance windfall while I lived on peanut butter sandwiches. Messages between Susan and her friends. Can't wait for the old bat to die so we can finally live proper. Really? The investigator had recorded conversations, too. Susan's voice came through crystal clear. Austin thinks he's family, but he's just David's mistake from his first marriage. Once Eleanor's gone, we'll have enough money to cut him off completely. Your grandmother was furious. Margaret said she changed her will six months ago. Your parents get nothing. Your siblings get $1,000 each. Everything else goes to you. The best part? The investigator had proof they'd already spent two $200,000. They didn't have new credit cards, loans against their expected inheritance. Deposits on a vacation home in Florida. I drove to their house with Margaret. It was Friday night, their weekly family dinner that I was never invited to. Through the window, I could see them celebrating with champagne and expense to take out. Susan opened the door, saw us both, and her face lit up with greed. Finally. Margaret, right? How much did mother leave us? We've been waiting so patiently. Logan and Ashley crowded behind her, practically bouncing with excitement. David appeared with a bottle of champagne, ready to toast their good fortune. I smiled. Actually, she left me everything. And this letter explaining how you lied about me being adopted. Susan's face went white. That's impossible. You're not even Real family. Oh, but I am. I pulled out the birth certificate grandma had kept safe. My mother was Jennifer Caldwell. You know, Dad's first wife. The one you made him pretend never existed. David's champagne bottle slipped from his hands, shattering on their expensive marble floor. The floor they'd renovated with money they thought they'd inherit. This has to be a mistake, Ashley whispered. Margaret stepped forward. There's no mistake.

We're experimenting with lighter fluid! The gallery is howling. Judge Thompson slams the gavel order, but he's laughing, too. Finally, we get to the blender. Jenna insists, I bought it! It's mine! Rick, dead serious, says, no, your honor, I deserve the blender because I'm the only one who knows how to use it without removing the lid. Jenna screams, that's because you blended my AirPods!

The drip became a stream. Threads were stripping exactly as I knew they would. Below, missus George and Mister Garcia, both in their 80s, complained about water stains spreading across their ceiling like cancer. Just get someone else, I told my landlord. Vinnie has an exclusive contract. Nobody else is authorized. Six Weeks in, the entire valve assembly was destroyed. I noticed the hallway floor starting to bow from water damage. Right above the load bearing beam. I used to check monthly. The Kit George Disposal had a bent blade that needed realigning monthly. Now. Don't touch it. My landlord warned when I reported the grinding. Then he finally came. Needs full replacement, $800. While waiting two weeks for parts, food backed up into both sinks. The smell attracted roaches. Missus George's home health aide, found her crying, terrified of the insects swarming her medication bottles. The second floor toilet flapper was defective. Needed adjusting every two weeks or it would run constantly. Vinny's assessment, whole toilet needs replacing, $600. It ran continuously for weeks. Water Bill jumped from $300 to $900. More concerning, I heard creaking from the bathroom floor joists that hadn't been there before. The basement door lock required graphite powder monthly in winter. That's specialty locksmith work, Vinny declared. Two weeks later, the lock failed completely. The basement flooded because nobody could get in to check the 10,000 in water damage. The foundation wall showed its first hairline crack. Invisible unless you knew where to look. I knew. Other tenants started complaining to the city. Three moved out, leaving empty units. By late fall, 22 work orders were pending. The bathroom faucet was spraying water. The disposal had corroded the pipes. The constantly running toilet had caused Calcium build up in the main line. All toilets were backing Up, Mister Garcia, who used a walker, fell trying to reach his building's only working bathroom on the second floor. The seized basement door meant nobody could access the water heater. When it started leaking 20 gallons of water per day straight into the foundation. The crack widened. I could fit a nickel in it now. Then winter hit hard. The buildings old radiator system needed monthly bleeding or pipes would freeze. Vinny didn't even know what radiator bleeding meant. The third floor radiators froze. First tenant started using space heaters. Overloading circuits. Breakers tripped constantly. Missus George spent a night without heat or power. Her oxygen machine dead. The city inspector arrived after multiple complaints, found 47 violations. The building was groaning now. A sound only I seem to notice. My landlord called me, desperate. You could help. That's against your policy, I reminded him. Day 29 of the city deadline. Nothing was fixed. Vinny had completed exactly

I've been with Jerry for four years. When he humiliated me during our baby shower at this fancy country club he wanted to go to, my cousin asked why my pupils look so red. And I explained that this morning I threw up so hard that the blood vessels in my eyes burst. Jerry exploded on me. Shut up. Nobody wants to hear about your bloody eyes and vomit. Can you just be pregnant without making it everyone else's problem? It's revolting. The entire room went silent. His own sister tried to intervene, but he doubled down. What, I'm supposed to pretend all this isn't gross? Yesterday she described how her nipples are leaking. Last week it was about her discharge and cellulite. We get it. You're pregnant. Your body is doing nasty things. His mom gasped. Jerry, she's carrying your child. That doesn't mean I need to hear about every disgusting thing happening to her. This is supposed to be a happy day and she's making me lose my appetite. I sat down my drink. You know what, you're absolutely right. I won't discuss you with any more updates, Jerry. He looked at me surprised, then pleased. Finally. Thank you. See, not that hard to keep all that private. Two days later, Jerry found me getting dressed for my 20 week anatomy scan. What time is the appointment? I'll drive Oh, I'm going alone. I don't wanna subject you to disgusting pregnancy stuff. His face scrunched up. But we find out if it's a boy or girl today. Yeah. And that involves the technician pressing a wand covered in gel all over my stomach while we look at our baby's private parts on a screen. Plus, they measure all the organs. Pretty gross medical stuff. That's different. No, it's not. You said pregnancy details revolt you. I'm respecting that. I took an Uber and when he showed up, I made him wait outside the doctor's office. The next day, his mom called him crying tears of joy. You're having a boy. He looks perfect. And you better have already apologized to your fiance. Jerry put the phone down and stormed into the bedroom. You said the doctor said we have to wait another few weeks before gender shows. I only said that not to disgust you. I didn't want you losing your appetite. You can't keep the gender from me. I'm not keeping anything. I'm protecting you from revolting pregnancy talk. Just like you asked. When people asked about baby names, I discuss them enthusiastically with everyone except Jerry. Our friends knew we were considering James. His parents knew about Thomas. His brother knew about William. Why won't you tell me the names you're considering? Discussing the baby requires mentioning pregnancy. That's off limits. Remember, this is insane. This is literally what you demanded. At 28 weeks, I started experiencing Concerning symptoms, my feet swelled so badly that when I pressed them, the indent stayed like memory foam and my vision kept getting black spots. I went to the hospital alone when they diagnosed me with pre eclampsia and admitted me for monitoring. I texted everyone except Jerry. He found out when his brother called asking why he wasn't at the hospital. You're in the hospital and didn't tell me medical details about pregnancy or TMI. You said so yourself. You could lose the baby and you could get so grossed out by looking at me. You'd call me disgusting and the stress would definitely make me lose it. He went quiet when the doctor scheduled my C section for 36 weeks due to complications. I didn't tell Jerry. I informed his family, my family, our friends, everyone but him. The baby is coming next Tuesday, his sister told him. Jerry called me frantically. Tuesday. You're having our son on Tuesday. Yep. Didn't wanna discuss you with talk about them cutting through my abdomen layers and pulling a baby out of my uterus. I need to request time off. Why? You don't wanna see gross pregnancy stuff. It's literally the birth of my child.

So we showed her what boys really do. My neighbor's son started hunting the moment he moved in three houses down, and I don't use that word lightly. When a girl rode by on her bike one morning, he yelled, you look better sitting on my face instead, loud enough for the whole street to hear. So I just wrote him off as another Jefferson High douchebag. So my little sister Maya came home crying and told me what he'd said to her. Monday morning, Maya left for school in her standard Jefferson uniform. Plaid skirt, white polo. Same outfit every girl wore. This new neighbor boy, who couldn't be older than 17, blocked her path at the corner and said, that uniform shows me exactly who you're gonna grow up to be. I wanna be first in line when you're ready. And made these wet kissing sounds until she ran. She's literally 14 years old. I walked her every morning after that, adding 20 minutes to our walk just to avoid him. By week two, he graduated to physical assault. My friend Emma sits next to me in chemistry. Sweet girl, wants to be a pediatric nurse. Thursday, she's reaching for beakers. When he pressed against her from behind, hands sliding onto her hips, and said, don't play hard to get. You know you want this. When she dirked away, he laughed and said, accident. But you Felt how hard I am. I know you liked it. The teacher was writing equations on the board, completely oblivious. Then he targeted Missus Smith, a 30 year old married woman who was just trying to plant marigolds in her front yard. This piece of crap stops his bike, watches her kneeling in the dirt, and says, I like you in that position, bent over. If you're bored of your husband, I can show you what a real man feels like. Then stood there grinning while she scrambled inside. No woman in the neighborhood was safe, and it didn't matter if you were 14 or 40. Sunday morning, my mom and a few others walked over for what they hoped would be a reasonable conversation. His mother answered in yoga pants and a namaste tank top, looking annoyed at the interruption. Our mothers explained calmly that her son had been making inappropriate comments to their daughters, touching them and making them uncomfortable. But she just laughed. Not nervous laughter, genuine amusement. Boys will be boys, she said while examining her manicure. Maybe your daughter shouldn't be so tempting. When they dress like that, what do you expect? My mom tried reasoning with her about the married women being harassed, too, but the woman just shrugged and said they should save their sexy energy for their husbands instead of parading it around the neighborhood. Then she shut the door in their faces, but not before adding that her son was just Being friendly. And we were all overreacting. That's when it clicked. She wasn't just clueless, she actually believed her son's behavior was normal. Fine. Show her exactly what boys being boys look like. I told my brother Jake everything that night. Jake's 19, played varsity football, has this crew of guys who look like they stepped out of a Crossfit commercial. He listened to every detail, jaw clenching when I described what happened to Maya. So if boys will be boys, I said, then be boys. Jake smiled. Not his usual goofy grin, but something sharper. Leave it to me. The next week, Jake and his friends started hanging around the creep at school. Fed his ego like a Thanksgiving Turkey. Acted like he was their new best friend. And this idiot ate it up. Showed them exactly how he made the kissing sounds, demonstrated his hip thrust technique. Repeated every disgusting thing he'd said. Maya is gonna be so ready in a few years. Emma was grinding on me in chemistry, playing hard to get. Mrs. Smith was basically begging for it. Bent over like that in her garden. Jake crew memorized everything. Every gesture, every phrase, every revolting detail. Two weeks of this. Two weeks of intelligence gathering disguised as friendship. Tuesday evening was showtime. Four guys positioned at the neighborhood entrance, waiting. Mrs. Perfect yoga mom pulled up in her white Honda Civic at 6:47, and PR bumper sticker gleaming. That pencil skirt shows me exactly what

I witnessed it during a briefing at Fort Campbell when Private Jake Miller had the guts to tell General Parker he was completely wrong about enemy positions. It was March 2019, middle of a deployment prep briefing. Hundred officers and senior Ncos packed into the main conference room. General Parker himself was running the show, going over satellite imagery of our target area in Syria. This was a big deal. Four star general, 30 years of experience. Bronstar with Valor. Guy had more combat time than most of us had total service. When he spoke, Colonels took notes. He's pointing at this aerial photo explaining enemy strongholds. According to our intelligence. hostiles have established three main positions along this ridge line. Here, here and here. I'm sitting in the back row with other junior enlisted, trying to stay invisible. That's when I noticed Jake shift in his seat. Kid looks uncomfortable, like he wants to say something, but knows better. Jake was our unit's drone operator. 20 years old, skinny kid from Ohio who'd been flying reconnaissance missions over that exact area for six months. He knew those mountains better than anyone in the room. General Parker continues the briefing. Our assault plan targets these three positions simultaneously. Alpha Team hits the northern compound. Bravo takes the center. Charlie approaches from the south. Jake's getting more agitated. Keep looking at the map. Then at His tablet. Then back at the map. Other guys near me notice him fidget. One sergeant gives him a warning look that says, sit still and shut up. But Jake's not just nervous. He's genuinely concerned. I can see him arguing with himself, weighing the consequences. Finally, he raises his hand. Dead silence. You can hear a pin drop. Privates don't interrupt four star generals during operational briefings. Ever. This was career suicide. In real time, General Parker stops mid sentence, looks directly at Jake with the kind of stare that melts steel. What is it, Son? Jake stands up, voice shaking but clear. Sir, with respect, those positions are wrong. The entire room goes ice cold. Colonel's exchange glances. I'm expecting Jake to get vaporized on the spot. Excuse me. The general's voice drops to a whisper, which somehow sounds more terrifying than shouting. You're telling me our intelligence is incorrect? Jake swallows hard, but doesn't back down. Sir, I've flown 47 reconnaissance missions over that sector. Those compounds you identified were abandoned three weeks ago. The real enemy positions are 800 meters east. Pulls out his tablet, approaches the front of the room like he's walking to his own execution. I have drone footage from yesterday, sir. Shows current activity patterns, heat signatures, vehicle movements. General Parker could have destroyed him. Should have destroyed him. Instead. He examines Jake's footage. Room waits in absolute silence while a four star general reviews intelligence from a private. After five eternal Minutes. The general straightens up. His expression is unreadable. Colonel Adams, he says to his intelligence officer, when was our last aerial reconnaissance of this sector? The colonel checks his files, face going pale. Uh, sir, it appears our most recent imagery is from last month. We were relying on ground reports for current positions. General Parker turns back to Jake. Private, you're telling me you have more current intelligence than my entire staff? Yes, sir. Been tracking enemy movement patterns daily. They relocated after we started bombing their supply routes. The general studies the new footage again, points to specific locations. These heat signatures here, what are they? Personal movement, sir. Usually peaks around O300 local time. Probable guard rotations. And these tracks? Vehicle access routes. They're using that wady for concealment, bringing in supplies after dark. Jake's pointing out details that nobody else had noticed. General Parker calls for his operations officer. Major, recalculate our approach vectors based on these positions. Want new targeting data within the hour. Then he turns back to Jake. Private Miller, correct? Yes, sir. Outstanding work. This intelligence potentially saved American lives. The briefing continues for another hour, completely reorganized around Jake's reconnaissance and data. New positions, new approach routes, new timing. Everything changed because one private paid attention to his job. After the meeting, General Parker approaches Jake personally. Son, how long have you been flying drones over this area? Six months, sir. Daily flights. And nobody thought to include your observations? In our intelligence briefing? No, sir. I submit reports, but they usually don't make it past company level. That changes today. You're now reporting directly to division Intelligence. Your observations will be included in all future operational planning. Jake got promoted to specialist two weeks early. A commendation letter from the general himself. More importantly, the mission succeeded with zero casualties because they hit actual enemy positions instead of empty buildings. The general instituted a new policy after that. Every operational briefing now includes input from field operators, regardless of rank. Called it the Miller Protocol. Jake finished his deployment as the youngest soldier ever assigned to division level intelligence. Last I heard, he's running drone operations for Special Forces somewhere classified.

It started innocent enough during flight school when they dubbed me Woody. Simple reason, my last name was Woods and I was the only guy in our class who could land a helicopter in high winds without breaking a sweat. Made perfect sense, clean, professional, easy to remember. I was proud of it, even had it stitched on my flight suit. For 2 years, everything was great. Woody this, Woody that. Other pilots respected the name. I got deployed to Afghanistan in 2,011. That's when things started going sideways. Our forward operating base was small, maybe 200 people total. Word travels fast in tight quarters like that. During my second week there, some guys from another unit overheard my call sign during a radio check. Woody, this is base control. Confirm your position. The snickering started immediately. Turns out half the base thought my call sign was referring to something completely different. You know what I mean? The joke started small but spread like wildfire through the barracks. Hey, Woody, you standing at attention? Need help pitching your tent tonight? The sophomore humor never stopped. I tried explaining the real origin, but nobody cared about the truth. When the lie was funnier made it worse. When mail call happened, my girlfriend back home had sent care packages addressed to Woody Woods. The mail clerk would announce it over the loudspeaker and the entire mess hall would erupt in laughter. Package for Woody Woods. The guys started calling me Double Wood, then Triple Wood when they really wanted to mess with me. What should have been a simple, respectable call sign turned into a daily source of embarrassment. But it got worse. When I rotated home, word had spread to other bases through transfers and reassignments. Everywhere I went, people already knew about Woody. The legend had grown beyond anything I could control. At Fort Campbell, random soldiers I've never met with salute and say good morning, Woody with these ridiculous grins on their faces. My new commanding officer actually asked if I wanted to request a call sign change. I considered it, but changing your call sign mid career is like admitting defeat. So I stuck with it, hoping things would calm down. They didn't. They got exponentially worse when social media became popular. Someone started a Facebook page called Woody Woods Fan Club, posted fake quotes attributed to me, shared memes using my official military photos. The page got thousands of followers, mostly other military personnel sharing inside jokes. I couldn't escape it. Dating became a nightmare. Try explaining to a woman why your military buddies keep messaging you with tree puns and lover yard jokes. Most thought I was some kind of weirdo. The absolute worst moment came during my retirement ceremony in 2018. Twenty years of faithful service, multiple commendations, two Bronze Stars, should have been the proudest day of my career. My commanding general was Reading my accomplishments to the assembled crowd. Then he gets to the call sign part. Throughout his distinguished career, Chief Warrant Officer Woods, known to his fellow aviators as Woody. He paused, looked at me, looked at the crowd of snickering soldiers, realized what he just said to a room full of people who knew the jokes, his face turned red, but he powered through the rest of the speech. After the ceremony, my 8 year old nephew ran up to me. Uncle Mike, why was everyone laughing when the general said your army name? My sister had to explain that sometimes adults have weird senses of humor. Now I'm completely retired, working as a civilian helicopter pilot for a medical transport company. Thought I'd finally escaped the nickname. Wrong again. Last month I'm flying a patient to the trauma center when the radio crackles. Medical Flight 47, this is tower control. Is that really Woody Woods in there? Word had somehow reached the civilian aviation community. The tower operator was a former army guy who remembered the stories. By the time I landed, three other pilots were waiting on the tarmac grinning and giving me thumbs up. Yesterday, my new business cards arrived clean, professional design, Michael Woods, senior pilot. But someone in the print shop had a sense of humor. At the bottom in tiny letters they'd added, ask me about my Woody. I called to complain and the guy just laughed, said it was a bonus feature No extra charge. Apparently, the legend of Woody Woods has reached even civilian contractors now.

The astronauts likely survived the challenger explosion. They were falling for nearly three minutes. Some of them had activated their emergency oxygen. Supposedly, there are audio recordings of their last moments. 2. A successful marriage ends with watching your spouse pass away. 3. The amount of abandoned pets that know they've been abandoned. 4. Very few people in your life would actually drop what they were doing to help you cherish the ones that would. Five. There's a recording of the last kawaii oo bird singing before it went extinct. It was a mating call sung by a male bird. The song has breaks for the female bird to respond. There's no response because the male kawaii oo is the last of its kind. 6. Your loved one didn't say any last words. For context, I worked in a nursing home. People always ask, did they say anything? And the truth is no. We obviously don't say that to the family, but it is not like in the movies. Also, a weird thing that happens sometimes is that 24 hours before passing away, they get a sudden spike of energy, which may look like they're getting better. So it confuses the family members. Sometimes working with old people broke me a little bit. 7. It took my dog a couple years to realize he was here to stay. I was his seventh owner. I am his Last he was returned to the shelter multiple times for behavioral issues, and when he acted out, he would immediately get depressed, thinking he was going back. Very good dog. Very happy now and has turned into quite an entitled princess. 8 whales never die of old age. They just become too weak to surface for air. 9 we abandoned the pigeons. We spent centuries domesticated them, being friendly to them, and as a result, they moved to our cities and relied on us. Then we decided they were pests. 10 the nurse by Einstein's bed when he passed noted that he said something sounding profound. Unfortunately, she didn't speak German, so we'll never know what his final words were.

One girl I dated in college broke my laptop because she kept trying to get a USB drive in. Instead of, you know, flipping it, she just pushed harder and harder until it broke my port and motherboard. 2. My boyfriend refused to eat basil I had bought from the grocery store because it was a full plant. I was keeping it outside and he insisted that he would not eat dirty food. I asked where he thought farmers kept produce, and he said that they had special areas for food to grow that was sterilized, but my plant was not food grade. I just looked at him with a dumbfounded look. I didn't know how to respond. Three. On a camping trip, she was worried about parking the car on the grass because she thought the grass was going to grow, puncturing and flattening the tires. Four. My husband thought people whistled when they set off fireworks. He didn't realize the fireworks themselves whistles, though. That was one of his more harmless stupidities. Five. He thought potatoes never go bad because his mom always kept a bag in the pantry. I asked him if they ate a lot of potatoes and he said yes. They have a large family with six kids and it still didn't click. Six. I bought fresh broccoli and my husband asked why it was so big. He thought broccoli grows in small bite Size pieces

Like we're talking about a man who buys generic cereal and then pours it into name brand boxes so the neighbors think we eat the good stuff. He drives a BMW that's literally held together with duct tape and prayers. He parks it at the front of the driveway so everyone can see it anyway. I'm a senior in high school and college application season is here. All my friends are talking about where they're applying and their parents are stressing about tuition costs. Meanwhile, my dad keeps making these weird comments about how I better figure out my future because money doesn't grow on trees. But he never actually said he wouldn't pay for college, so I just assumed he would. Big mistake. I applied to my dream school and got accepted with a partial scholarship. I was so pumped and ran downstairs to tell my parents. My mom was excited and started crying happy tears, but my dad just looked at me and said, that's nice, honey. Hope you can afford it. I was confused and asked what he meant. He shrugged and said college was my responsibility now that I was becoming an don't. I felt my stomach drop. This man had literally never told me I'd be paying for college myself. We'd never had that conversation. I Was so angry and hurt that I decided to be petty about it. If you wanted to embarrass me, I'd return the favor. The next week was my 18th birthday party at our house. All my relatives were there, plus some family friends and neighbors. My dad loves showing off in front of people, so he was in his element, talking about his successful business and giving everyone financial advice. That's when I struck. During the cake cutting, I stood up and tapped my fork against my glass like I was making a toast. Everyone got quiet and looked at me. I smiled real big and said, thanks, everyone, for coming to celebrate with me. I just wanted to share some exciting news about my future. My dad looked proud, probably thinking I was about to thank him or something. I got into my dream college with a scholarship, which is amazing, because my dad just told me he's not helping pay for my education at all.

The op later confirmed the news story was indeed about his wife and children. Horrendously sad. 2, the one where a dying mother told her teen that she was the product of an affair. Reddit encouraged the girl to tell her dad the truth. She took the advice and he kicked her out. Since he was the legal father, the state made him take her back in and he reacted by making life really difficult for the girl who by this point had no one else. She posted one last time on a sub about suicide saying that she'd taken something to end her life. 3, that dude that shot his dick off, cooked it and ate it, you slash worthless. 3, 19. 4 I don't remember the sub.

People figured out the post was written by a guy trying to rape someone and Get away with it.

I couldn't remember a single time that she complimented me on my appearance. So I said that to her. I said, you know, I always tell you how beautiful you are and how attracted to you I am, but I never recall you ever saying that I look good or that I look handsome. She stopped applying her mascara long enough to dismissively roll her eyes at me. So I made the mistake of asking her, do you even find me attractive? And she flatly said no. I asked, why did you marry me then? And she said, I didn't think it was important at the time. I never felt so ugly and unloved.

But it was all a facade to hide what he really was. To call him an evil piece of shit would be an insult to shit. 4. Jim Jones was a prominent figure in support of the civil rights movement. He contributed significantly to desegregation activism in Indiana. He also performed a lot of charity work, establishing soup kitchens and providing food and clothing to the poor. 5. King Leopold of the Belgians. He presented himself as a humanitarian who was motivated by a desire to improve the lives of Africans. He was allowed to establish personal rule over what was then the Congo Free State. In reality, his regime caused the death of millions of Congolese inhabitants, including children. They were worked to death at gunpoint, systematically mutilated, murdered, or starved to death. 6. In my small rural Indiana hometown, we had this well respected DARE officer who later became mayor, who later was convicted of soliciting minors in possession of CP.

One, Robert Durst. He was caught while being interviewed for an HBO series to which he initially agreed on to clear his name. Went to bathroom and mumbled to microphone which he thought was off. What the hell did I do? Kill all of them. Of course, this was later presented to the court as evidence. You can still watch it on HBO. Two, the Dunbar armored robbery, the largest cash heist in US history. A six man inside job to rob an armored cash depot. They set up a house party as an alibi, use the keys to get into the cafeteria and waited in there until all employees came in on break, ambushed and subdued them without firing a shot or raising an alarm. They then loaded the money bags with over $18 million into a U Haul, destroyed the CCTV tapes and returned to the party. Then they sat on the money for six months before hiring a crooked lawyer to set up a real estate money laundering scheme to avoid suspicion. Two years after the robbery, one of the men paid a real estate broker with a stack of money still wrapped in the original currency strap. The broker immediately reported it to the police. After being arrested, he cracked under interrogation, confessed to the robbery and ratted out his partners. All the men have since finished their prison sentences. And most of the money was never found. So there's a chance they still won in the end.

And under occupation, some even participated in sending people to camps. However, after the war, history was often rewritten to glorify the resistance, which was actually made up of a small group of individuals opposing Nazi occupation. 3, the business plot. Yes, a group of powerful Wall Street figures tried to raise an army of 500,000 men to seize the White House, overthrow FDR, and install a fascist government. And yes, Congress investigated it under seal and concluded that the plot was real, but never named the conspirators. It's somewhat similar to what happened with Epstein. 4. There were more countries in the axis powers than just Germany, Italy and Japan. 5, Expansionist Japan and the atrocities they committed during the 1930s are completely skipped over in most school curriculum, even though it was less than 100 years ago.

A human stomach can't digest another human stomach, as it contains the same mucus that actually made multiple cannibalistic murderers get caught because they went to doctors with stomach issues. 6.

It's not that Japan is actually particularly a bad place to live, but they still utilize antiquated technology, have dated social mores and brutal work life balance, and are quite xenophobic and openly turn away foreigners from many services, even medical care. It's not some anime Utopia where everything is perfect. It's quite a challenging place to live for foreigners. It seems Japan welcomes the visitor, but does not always welcome the immigrant. 3. Birthing and raising a baby. People will acknowledge that it's not easy, sure, but it's so much harder than imagined, especially if you don't have a good support system. 4.

The worst fact is that victims might survive the first hole with all brain function intact and live long enough to be fully aware they were going to get a second or third hole drilled. Two, surgeons used to operate on infants without anesthesia, including open heart surgery. They have stopped this, however, in the 1980s. 3, manatees have vaginas that are the most anatomically similar to humans. Manatees may also be the inspiration for myths about mermaids, beautiful half fish women that lured sailors to their deaths. Connecting those dots has been mentally scarring. 4, that a dolphin committed suicide after falling in love with its handler that used to jerk the dolphin off. 5.

Once he threw my laptop down the stairs because I used his bathroom. Mom would find me with split lips and black eyes. But Jacob always had an excuse ready. She fell off her bike again, he'd say, ruffling my hair like some caring big brother. You know how clumsy little sis is. The worst part, everyone believed him. Teachers, neighbors, even our grandparents thought Jacob was this amazing kid who looked out for his accident prone sister. He played varsity football, got decent grades and charmed adults with his fake smile and perfect manners. At home, though, I lived in constant fear. He'd wait until mom left for her nursing shifts, then make my life hell, holding my head underwater in the bathtub until I saw stars, locking me in the basement for hours, feeling my birthday money and laughing when I cried. I Learned to hide in my room the second I heard his chuckle up. The physical stuff was bad, but the mind games were worse. He'd break my things and blame me, tell mom I was lying about homework to get me grounded. he convinced her I was doing drugs by planting a joint in my backpack. I spent three months in Counseling. Because of that lie, everything changed. The night of his championship game, our whole extended family came to watch Jacob play. Aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, even mom's boss showed up. Jacob scored the winning touchdown and everyone went crazy cheering his name. After the game, we all met at Denny's to celebrate. The whole back section was reserved for us. Jacob was soaking up the attention, telling war stories about his epic plays while everyone hung on every word. I was picking up my fries in the corner trying to stay invisible when my five year old cousin Lily started crying. She spilled chocolate milk all over her new pink dress and was having a complete meltdown. The sticky mess was everywhere. Other diners were staring. Mom was trying to clean it up while Aunt Grace dug through her purse for wet wipes. Without thinking, Jacob snapped. Shut up, you little brat, he screamed, grabbing her tiny wrist hard enough to leave marks. Stop being such a crybaby. You're ruining everything. The whole restaurant went dead silent. Conversation stopped mid sentence. Even the kitchen seemed to quiet down. But here's the thing, Lily wasn't me. She wasn't trained to take it quietly and apologize.

So I bought this cute new sports bra from target last week. Nothing fancy, just black with some pink stripes. I was excited to wear it to the gym because my old one was falling apart and I felt good about myself for once. I walked into my usual gym around six PM when it's always packed with college kids and people getting off work. The second I stepped inside, something felt weird, like really weird. Everyone just stopped what they were doing. The guy doing bench press literally let the bar rest on his chest and stared. The girl on the treadmill almost tripped because she turned her head so fast. Even the front desk worker stopped scanning membership cards. I thought maybe I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe or something embarrassing like that. Checked my reflection in the mirror wall and everything looked normal. Sports bra, leggings, sneakers, hair in a messy bun, same as always. But people kept staring and whispering to each other. I tried to ignore it and went to grab a yoga mat from the rack. That's when I heard this girl behind me whisper to her friend, oh my god, does she not know? Her friend shushed her really loud and they both walked away quickly when they saw me looking. Now I was getting paranoid. I went to the bathroom to check myself again. Maybe I had a huge stain or my bra was see through under the gym lights. But nope, everything looked fine. Sports bra was actually really cute and supportive. I felt confident in it. When I came back out, more people were staring. This older woman on the elliptical kept looking at me and shaking her head with this disgusted expression. A group of guys by the weight rack were pointing and laughing. I was starting to feel sick to my stomach. I decided to just start my workout and ignore everyone. I got on a treadmill and started jogging. The girl next to me kept glancing over every few seconds. Finally, she leaned over and said, hey, I don't wanna be rude, but do you know what that symbol means? I had no idea what she was talking about. What symbol? I asked. Pulling out my earbuds, she pointed at my chest area. On your sports bra, that's not just a design. I looked down at the pink stripes I thought were cute. But now that she mentioned it, they weren't just random stripes. They formed a shape I hadn't noticed before. My stomach dropped when I realized what it was. The pink stripes made a perfect swastika right across my chest. I felt my face turn bright red. Oh, my god. I had no idea. I just thought it was a geometric pattern. I was mortified. No wonder everyone was staring at me like I was some kind of Monster. The girl nodded sympathetically. Yeah, I figured you didn't know. You seem way too nice to be wearing that on purpose. But like everyone in here thinks you're making some kind of statement. I immediately stopped the treadmill and grabbed my towel to cover my chest. I practically ran to the locker room, feeling everyone's eyes on me. A few people were taking pictures with their phones. I wanted to disappear into the floor in the locker room. I called my roommate, Emma, freaking out. She drove over in like 10 minutes with one of her overs.

One. The first piece of jewelry I bought my wife was a necklace. We went on holiday and she lost it. I said I would replace it, but it wasn't the same. She was upset that she'd lost it for sentimental reasons. I emailed the hotel, and of course, they hadn't found it. So I bought a replacement and told my wife they found it. 2. Not me, but my parents. If my mom wants to hide literally anything from my dad, no matter what it is, she just puts it somewhere where he would have to bend over to see it. Doesn't matter if it's something like a package of ore. If my dad has to bend over to find it, he's never going to find it. I've tested it with my own snacks when I was still living with them to confirm it works. He'd be mad if he knew how many snacks we'd hidden from him simply because he doesn't bend over low enough to see it in the cabinet. 3. I wanted my husband to quit wearing denim shorts because they made him look old. He had gained a bit of weight, so I kept buying his shorts in his old size 34. And I bought khaki shorts in a 38. He will never read a label for any reason. He would put on the jorts and then lay on the bed and lift And spread his legs to stretch out the shorts a bit. He blew out the back seam of two pairs in the same day, then ended up putting on the khaki shorts. Since then, almost 20 years, he has insisted that khaki shorts are made better and fit more comfortably than denim shorts of the same size. Four the remote didn't disappear. I accidentally put it through the washing machine and destroyed it and threw it out in a panic. 5. I only put spiders outside when she sees them. If they're only noticed by me, I let them continue hunting bugs, sometimes with a few soft words of encouragement. You're doing a great job, little guy.

They're for paying residents only, so walking in from the main entrance just to grab one will reveal you to be a ruffian just out for a free apple. This is what you will need to do. Enter the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, get the lift to the 44th floor, get out and walk clockwise until you find the Waldorf Towers lift. Get in and o head down to reception. Now you will emerge from the lifts looking like a paying resident and you can grab an apple from the bowl and continue on your merry way. The whole process takes around 7 minutes, but it's so worth it for that apple. That juicy, succulent motherfucker. PS I last did this several times when I was in NY back in 2,010. The only thing I can't remember exactly is the number of which floor to get off. I think it's 44, but I'm not too sure. Regardless, when you're in the lift, select the floor on which all the ballrooms and banqueting suites are situated on. That's the floor which spreads over both the Waldorf Astoria and the Waldorf Towers, and thus has lifts for both hotels. Good luck comrades!

Don't want to go into all the details, but through some time and events, the Japanese ended up eating those servicemen. But that's not the weird part.

When they came to his house on the day of departure with their most precious belongings, he would give them a special vaccine since they were allegedly going to South America. He killed them all, took their stuff, also made them pay some high fee for his help in the first place, and dissolved their corpses in his basement with acid. 3.

One, not exactly a fan theory, but I thought Steven Spielberg's War of the worlds would have been 100 times better if the final shot was that tripod falling down and its alien pilot falling out. Except for one crucial difference. Instead of a generic alien body, the aliens behind the invasion are ETS. You find out in the last few seconds of the movie that you've been watching. A sequel to what you thought was a cuddly family friendly movie about a young boy and his alien buddy, but was actually about how a naive little kid thwarted authorities and help the alien scout who laid the groundwork for an invasion and attempted genocide 2. The Rebecca Black Song Friday is about the JFK assassination. The driver of the car he was assassinated in, his name was Samuel Kickin. Kickin in the front seat, sitting in the back seat. The assassination occurred on a Friday and when he was shot, the Secret Service yelled at Jackie Kennedy to get down. Got to get down. On Friday, parts about the Cold War and the spread of communism are referenced. Everybody's Russian. And to top it all off, in the hotel that morning, JFK declined a breakfast of sausage, eggs and toast for a bowl of Bran Flakes instead. Got to have my bowl. Got to have cereal. Also the following Monday, JFK was supposed to sign a Bill into Law requiring all public schools to provide bus transportation for their students. Got to catch My Bus. 3.

One day I came home sobbing and explained to my dad that this kid was still calling me carrot line rabbits eat you all day. So my dad asks what the kid's name is. I tell him it's Daniel and he helps me come up with something I can call him. We settle on Daniel, Daniel Cocker Spaniel go pee in the yard. So the next day I'm at preschool and there he is calling me carrot line rabbits eat you all day. So I put my hands on my hips and I say, whatever, Daniel, Daniel Cocker Spaniel go pee in the yard. Turns out Daniel, Daniel Cocker Spaniel was a little crybaby bitch and I got time out. Two heard kids arguing whose parents has cooler cars? One kid yells, my dad has a BMW and my mom has a Morano. Without missing a beat, other kid yells, that's cause your mom's a Morano 3 kind of tangential to the question, but I was babysitting my niece, 7 at the time, and we were play arguing.

One, I once had both a cat and a Guinea pig some 25 years ago and they seem to hate each other. Whenever my cat got near the cage, the Guinea pig would start squealing aggressively at the cat and the cat would SWAT at the cage while sporting a look of utter disgust. That was a daily routine. It was the first thing that happened in the morning and it lasted a minute. Then they didn't bother each other for the rest of the day and the cat could even nap on top of the cage at times without any protest for either. It was just part of the day for them. That drama just had to happen every day. They went on like that for 7 years. The Guinea pig got really sick because he was old and I realize he doesn't have long left. I picked him up out of the cage and put him on my lap so he didn't have to die alone. The fucking cat came up and licked the Guinea pig and laid on my lap beside him until he passed. Apparently the cat loved him all along. The seven year drama was just their thing. That still amazes me. 2. My roommate has two large male dogs and I have a small female dog. My roommate's male dogs like to rough house and play around sometimes whenever They get too loud. My little dog will raise her head and growl ever so slightly just enough for them to hear her. As soon as she does, they stop for a minute and start playing quieter. Fucking surreal to see. 3. I have a cat, a puppy and a dog. Cat likes to lure the puppy under the bed and he can get under but get stuck in the middle where it's the lowest. I have to rescue him usually around 2:00am and he wakes me up by scratching the floor trying to get out. Cat also likes to knock off things from the counter he knows puppy should not be chewing on. Puppy and cat like to wrestle with each other, but dog doesn't like the ruckus and barks at them to stop. Cat doesn't like the barking, so then he chases dog. Puppy follows cat and there's a train of three, Tom and Jerry style through the house. At the end of the day, though, they are always in a big cuddle pile, so I think they'll be okay. Four. The dog doesn't like when the cat gives him dirty looks. The cat knows this, will deliberately stare him down and then expertly leap out of the way when he goes to chase her. 5. In college, we lived in the second floor and would leave the sliding glass door open with the screen door shut. On nice days. We'd often come home to find my dog Stuck on the balcony. We figured out that my roommate's cat was opening the screen door to let the dog out and then closing the door.

What's the most embarrassing situation where you've been mistaken for your twin? One, my twin brother recommended a restaurant to me, said that he and his wife went there all the time. Good food, really friendly staff. So I took my wife there. Food was as advertised, but the service somewhere between cold and openly hostile, like they resented our presence. I was puzzled by the contrast between what I'd heard and what I saw. Suddenly from the front of the restaurant, explosion of laughter, much rapid talking. Suddenly the waitress is there smiling and all, just as my brother and his wife walk around the corner. They thought my brother was cheating on his wife with some blonde. Yeah, it's funny now. 2, I was dating a girl in college. The first time I went to her house, she opened the door. I told her I liked what she did to her hair and kissed her. She kissed me. We went inside. She then yells, your boyfriend is here. They were weird girls. 3. Not a twin, just Asian. Constantly asked at work about projects I am not involved in. Realize co workers think I am the other Asian guy. 4. Not me, but a co worker has two sets of twin daughters. The younger pair are identical and both work at the same McDonald's. The manager often puts one on the pay window and the other on the food window just to mess with Customers. 5, I've been called my twin sister's name my whole life. So one day I accidentally introduced myself to someone as her. When I caught and corrected myself they thought I was straight up crazy for not knowing my own name. 6, a friend and his wife go to the same supermarket every week. His identical twin also goes there with his wife. One day after summoning up the courage, the cashier pulls my friend's wife aside and says, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but I've seen your husband here several times with another woman. 7, my friend said hi to his brother one morning. Well, it turns out his brother was actually his own reflection in a window. His mom witnessed it and has never let him live it down. 8, my twin had recently committed suicide and I was at a bar drinking away my rage and a friend of his came up and flipped out on me saying how awful of a joke it was and took everything I had not to remove their teeth with my fist.

Looking back on my time in college, I got some pretty clear signs that I completely missed. If a girl invites you back to her dorm because she forgot something and then can't remember what she was going back to get and then sits on her bed and just kind of looks at you, that's a pretty clear sign. I think about that occasionally. I can't believe I missed that. 1. 6, laughing at everything I say. It's how I recognized my girlfriend. Like me, I could say virtually anything and I could see her laughing. 7, if you see that person hiding in a tree outside your window. 8. I Like things to be very clear and obvious. So I insist on waiting for them to issue me a Section 3.02 notice intention to pursue romantically, which will set out their detailed five year plan for us and describe the boundaries of their proposed pursuit, including likes, dislikes and information on any allergies. Still waiting, but one day I'm sure my luck will turn.

I woke up, watched Buffy, ate pizza, called my brother, went to work, came home and watched the end of the series of Buffy. It may sound like a joke, but I got up after finishing Buffy the Vampire Slayer and went walking. I kept listening to Gangsters Paradise on my iPod until I reached the Aurora Bridge. I live in Seattle. If you know the bridge, you may know that in the last couple years, they have built very high fences around it. But when I was there, there was just a small handrail. I walked to the middle of the bridge and looked down for a while. This part of the bridge was overland and not water, so I continued to walk until I wasn't above someone's yard. I was probably 100 yards before the end of the bridge. I stood looking over the railing for 10 minutes, maybe more. A man got off the 16 bus at the stop right before the bridge and walked toward me. He stopped beside me and asked if I was okay, and I didn't reply for a while. He just stood next to me for a while and just kept talking. He never stopped talking. He talked about the bridge and the bus and his family and about his work and chattered away for a solid 10 minutes. He asked where I lived and I told him Put his hand on my back and coerced me off the bridge and onto a bus. He bust me home and walked me to my front door. I never got his name and I haven't seen him since. But he saved my life. I don't know that I would ever have killed myself, but that's the closest I ever came to it. A stranger saved me and I really hope he knows that. 2. I treated it like a normal day. I got up, went to school, came home and went for it. I tried to enjoy the last moments I had with friends. I wanted to tell somebody but decided not to. I didn't want to bring anyone down. The day before, I wrote letters to those closest to me. On my last day, I left them on the kitchen counter, headed up to the roof and just stared down. It was around nine PM so when I glanced down, I saw nothing. It was pitch black. My right foot hovered around the edge. Right when I was about to leap off, I looked up cross the street. I saw a few people staring at me from their apartment window. This little girl, though, her gaze caught my eye. She shook her head then covered her face. Because of her, I didn't go through with it. 3, my younger brother texted me early that morning in a really good mood saying what a great day it was going to Be then he apparently went around giving out his stuff, buying people lunch and telling his close friends his bank info, etc. He wanted to make sure his friends were covered. I was at work so I didn't get the I love you Dragon flexo text until after he was in the hospital. The sad thing was when I read that text, I knew something was wrong. 4 my friend put on his Facebook the day before he did it, if you had one day to live, what would you do? The day he did it, he went around to all of his close friend and just spent a little time with them, like a half hour, just hang out and shoot shit as usual. Later that night, he texted everyone goodbye. He drove down to one of our favorite smoke spots and obviously no one knows after that except him. But that's where two of my friend found him the next day.

One, I didn't find this loophole, but my friend did. A few years back, an online store had this promotion where whoever spent the most money over a month would get free round trip airplane tickets to anywhere in the world. My friend who's a fucking genius found that one thing you could buy on the site was a gift certificate. So he bought a 25 dollar gift certificate and kept spending it on another 25 dollar gift certificate. So he ended up spending 25 dollars on round trip tickets to Australia. 2. My brother once yelled last one to jump in the pool is gay and then jumped into the pool. However, I figured out that if I did not jump in, then technically he would be the last one in the pool and he is still gay to this day. 3. I used to work at papa John's to pay my way through college. There was a contest we had where if you got someone to upsize their pizza from like a medium to a large for an extra $2, you got points towards movie tickets. A large was simply $2 extra normally anyways, anyone that ordered a large, I simply put in a medium and up sized it. I won every fucking week my co workers didn't notice this obvious loophole and it didn't cost the customer extra. So I didn't have a problem with this morally gray Area, free movie tickets every week was a huge in college. Four, there was a drink machine in college that was 75 cents for a juice. If you put a dollar in, it gave you five quarters in change. I got a juice every day for months before they finally fixed it. 5. When I wear glasses, white people aren't afraid of me. I can blend in anywhere. Nobody wants to be the guy who asks if the black guy really works there. I can walk straight in. Area 51, edit. I'm in the hospital. They shot me in the leg and said I was trespassing. Thanks whoever told me to bring that clipboard. It deflected a bullet. Probably saved my life, honestly. 6, that you can jiggle the handle of certain gumball machines to get free gumballs. 7. For a while, McDonald's had a promo where when you walked in, you could scan a QR code and possibly get free food. However, different locations and different cutouts had different codes. I took pics of as many unique codes I could find, put them all on a handy PDF and scanned them all using an Android device and an Los device. Before lunch, I got free extra value meals regularly. In fact, I still had a couple free ones left over when they stopped the promotion.

One. I had a friend I was crushing on, and I thought he liked me, too. One day we were chatting online and he had to leave for work. Before logging off, he said, I'll be back later to spend more time with my favorite Asian. Confused, I asked, who's that? For as long as I knew him, he thought I was Asian. Once he found out I wasn't, he ghosted me. Two. I was at a dinner party and people kept offering me drinks that I continued to decline. Eventually, one woman's eyes lit up as she looked between me and my husband, and then she asked, oh my gosh, are you pregnant? Everyone around us got quiet, and I laughed and said, no, I have epilepsy. I was handed no more glasses of wine after that. 3. My ex wife was convinced I had another family in another state simply because she heard a kid's voice in the background when I was traveling for work and sitting in a restaurant. Once during divorce depositions, I spent a full day being questioned, and half the questions were slightly different wordings of so you have another family, kid, etcetera. 4. One time in Japan, I asked an old lady for directions in Japanese. I was still a beginner, but I tried my best to speak in their language rather than asking stuff in English. So this lady Assumed I spoke very good Japanese and started chatting. I tried telling her I couldn't understand and everyone else on the bus was trying to hide their laughter. The conversation went on for 10 minutes and I still have no idea what she was saying. She was very nice though. 5 I live in a very Hispanic slash Latino area and one woman heard me speak English and yelled at me for not speaking Spanish, calling me a traitor to my ancestors and bringing shame to my past family history in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Imagine her surprise when I told her I was Arab and Middle Eastern. Still felt guilty for not knowing Spanish for some reason lol. 6 people assumed as high school I was eating nothing but junk because I was rapidly gaining weight while my twin wasn't. In truth I was starving myself because I couldn't figure out why I was gaining weight. It wasn't until my 20s I found out I had a tumor on my thyroid and that's what caused the weight gain.

When she said what kind of bird is a ham? Was hard to ignore. 2. When he ran out of gas while in line at the Starbucks drive through right across the street from the gas station. I told him to get gas first because his car was low, but he really needed that iced caramel macchiato. I asked why he didn't listen to me and he replied with I thought I could make it. He ended up pushing the car through the drive through and got his coffee while doing so, then parked the car in the lot and called a tow to tow it back home instead of the gas station across the street. No, he did not get any gas that day. He waited until his dad got off work to bring a three gallon jug of gasoline because I refused to enable that shit. 3. How do oil companies know where to build gas stations? She thought that there was a gasoline bubble underground that they would tap into and run a line straight to the pump. She was working for Chevron. 4. She thought that Islands Float. 5. When he asked my grandmother if she'd ever had children. 6. I was having bad cramps and I took an Advil. My ex told me I shouldn't take them because it's a gazebo. 7. She seemed to be confused about the difference between flamingos and penguins, but Insisted they weren't real because she'd grown up in Alaska and never seen any. 8 he played a lot of cod and got a tattoo based on a cool design he saw in the game. It was the Nazi eagle. Nine I told him I had to leave in one and a half hours. He told me that was oddly specific and I should have rounded up to two hours instead of one hour and 50 minutes. I clarified that I had to leave in one hour and 30 minutes, and he said, that's actually 1.3 hours. 10 her look at the moon. That ain't right. Me what do you mean, her? You're not supposed to see the moon during the daytime. The government put that there to spy on us. Me what? 11 I was going into anaphylactic shock at a restaurant due to unknown allergy. My throat was closing and I had no neck due to swelling. He asked if I wanted to go outside to get some air. We were sitting on the patio. 12 he insisted that Spain was in South America because they spoke Spanish.

One A recruit fired all his blank ammo during ambush response training. He crawled in ditch to opposite where the aggressors were and started throwing rocks at them. Dye came running in middle of the road blowing his whistle and screaming what the fuck are you doing? Recruit screamed back throwing hand grenades. Drill sergeant without missing a beat, the DI screamed outstanding! And walked away. Two asked a private the difference between cover and concealment. Private said drill sergeant, you asked what seems like a very important question which I am supposed to know the answer. However, this private was imagining not being called on and was not paying attention to the question. Drill Sergeant 3 I ordered the platoon to form up facing west. One troop asked Master Corporal, our west or your west? I just walked away angrily and let his peers sort him out. I came out of my office and they were facing east. Four required to have creases in your uniform, and if you know anything about it, you can sometimes fuck it up and give a shirt. Two creases commonly referred to as railroad tracks. On morning information for uniform inspection it was discovered someone had done this to their shirt, so in come the disc. At one point one of them yelling, asked Recruit X, are you a train conductor? And sure as shit he was before he joined. So He answered, sir, yes, sir. Everyone got awkward quiet for what felt like five minutes, but I'm sure it was only five seconds. And then the group of them went on yelling at the next person in Formation. 5 I heard a recruit say this. D S, did your mother send you here to piss me off? You write home and tell her you're doing a good job. Recruit sir, no, sir. My father sent me here to piss my mother off. DS spun on his heel and marched off with his head down and his hand over mouth. 6 I feel bad for the guy, but I gotta say it. His last name was smelly, as in smelly. So when I had him come into the class for the Orientations Admin Day, the very first day, I asked everyone to stand up and give their rank, name, serial number. So when I heard Private Smelly, I lost it. I felt so bad for the guy.

I'm not sure I fully understand that. 1. 2, my wife has told me taking my shirt off with one hand is a thing that kind of blew my mind. 3. My heart does a little flip each time my significant other ever so slightly puts his hand on my back when we're walking to guide me or if he's trying to squeeze by behind me. I don't know why that gets me fired up, lol. 4, an ex said it was hot watching me change her car's oil. 5, there was a study done in Japan to see what school aged ladies saw as attractive in their male counterparts and running fast was like No.. 1 or 2 for elementary and middle schoolers. 6, carrying as many folding chairs as you can at once. 7. I heard one million power in rise of kingdoms gets you any girl you want. Eight, something, something rolled up sleeves. 9, getting super excited, talking about a nerdy interest they care about. A lot of guys suppress caring about things. 10, a girl told me that my sleepy voice was sexy. I have no idea if this is just a her thing or. 11, I once changed a radiator in my house and that without doubt. Got me more attention and flattery from the women in my life than anything else I've ever done. 12, my Bf and I went to eat at this restaurant before we knew we had feelings for each other. While I would talk, he would either laugh or smile. And once while doing so, he circled the rim of his glass with his finger. I later found out that he did it unconditionally, but I short circited while he did it.

That the reason old people move so slowly is that they are in pain. 2. Balloon fish inhale water to expand, not air. Gonna blame Nemo for that. 3. I didn't realize how much I interrupted people while they were talking until one person didn't let me. They bulldozed right over whatever the fuck I had to add. I'm much more aware now. 4A Fortnite is called that because it's 14 nights. Five. I legitimately thought you grew pickles, like, underwater. I'm not a smart man. 6. I thought when people said you can't stare at the sun it was because it was a really hard thing to do. Like a skill rather than the truth, which is it damages your eyes horribly. So I'd boast at how I could stare for up to three minutes before I had to look away. Glad I didn't take you can't breathe underwater literally. 2 7. I had to explain to my mother, sister, and boyfriend that cobwebs are leftover spider webs that collected dust, not just dust magically stringing together. 8. I thought it was normal to get a little burning sensation in your throat when you eat hazelnuts. Turns out I was allergic. Nine. Horses scratch themselves behind their ears just like a dog does. Like, with their hind legs. 10. The bald spot on the back of my head. I mean, I knew it was there for a few years. But last month, we moved into a new house, and the upstairs bathroom has a large wall mirror across from the vanity mirror. So now every morning while I brush my teeth, all I can do is stare at my bald spot. All this time, I've been walking around like this, unaware of just how large and obvious it was. 11 I was told a couple weeks ago that hay was just dried grass. I thought it was its own thing that grew, and I just never saw it.

It may sound like a joke, but I got up after finishing Buffy the Vampire Slayer and went walking. I kept listening to Gangsters Paradise on my iPod until I reached the Aurora Bridge. I live in Seattle. If you know the bridge, you may know that in the last couple years, they have built very high fences around it. But when I was there, there was just a small handrail. I walked to the middle of the bridge and looked down for a while. This part of the bridge was overland and not water, so I continued to walk until I wasn't above someone's yard. I was probably 100 yards before the end of the bridge. I stood looking over the railing for 10 minutes, maybe more. A man got off the 16 bus at the stop right before the bridge and walked toward me. He stopped beside me and asked if I was okay, and I didn't reply for a while. He just stood next to me for a while and just kept talking. He never stopped talking. He talked about the bridge and the bus and his family and about his work and chattered away for a solid 10 minutes. He asked where I lived, and I told him. He Put his hand on my back and coerced me off the bridge and onto a bus. He bust me home and walked me to my front door. I never got his name, and I haven't seen him since. But he saved my life. I don't know that I would ever have killed myself, but that's the closest I ever came to it. A stranger saved me, and I really hope he knows that. 2. I treated it like a normal day. I got up, went to school, came home and went for it. I tried to enjoy the last moments I had with friends. I wanted to tell somebody, but decided not to. I didn't want to bring anyone down. The day before, I wrote letters to those closest to me. On my last day, I left them on the kitchen counter, headed up to the roof, and just stared down. It was around nine PM, so when I glanced down, I saw nothing. It was pitch black. My right foot hovered around the edge. Right when I was about to leap off, I looked up across the street. I saw a few people staring at me from their apartment window. This little girl, though her gaze caught my eye. She shook her head, then covered her face. Because of her, I didn't go through with it. 3. My younger brother texted me early that morning in a really good mood, saying what a great day it was going to Be then. He apparently went around giving out his stuff, buying people lunch, and telling his close friends his bank info, etc. He wanted to make sure his friends were covered. I was at work so I didn't get the I love you Dragon flexo text until after he was in the hospital. The sad thing was when I read that text I knew something was wrong. 4 my friend put on his Facebook the day before he did it if you had one day to live, what would you do? The day he did it he went around to all of his close friend and just spent a little time with them. Like a half hour. Just hang out and shoot shit as usual. Later that night he texted everyone goodbye. He drove down to one of our favorite smoke spots and obviously no one knows after that except him, but that's where two of my friend found him the next day.

I think this is the female equivalent of a man rolling up the long sleeves on his shirt. 2. Say your name when they say good night. If it's over, text. 3, whenever my girlfriend tries to get my attention, she tugs at my shirt sleeve and says, boyfriend, boyfriend. I guess it sounds weird, but I think it's the cutest thing in the world. 4, I love it when a girl stretches. Just a yawn and a stretch in the morning does it. Five, cute little sneezes, snoring and sounds they make. Sometimes even breathing can seem cute. 6. One girl that I know scrunches her nose to fix her glasses. It's adorable. 7, mild frustration from a joke. I know oddly specific, but I swear they try not to laugh, but they can't help it. So they just have a tiny fit and it's cute to me. 8, wink at me with both of their eyes. 9, that little wiggle when they are putting on tight pants. 10. I like when they are thinking at work and put their hair over their top lip like a mustache. 11, that little dance they do when they show off a dress with pockets. 12, the way most of them giggle. IDK what it is, but when you hear a woman genuinely giggle, It's warming on the inside. 13, my girlfriend does this thing where she'll say something really adorable in bed that makes her feel really awkward afterwards, so she says it, then hides under the blanket afterwards. I love it. 14, it ranges from cute to attractive, but a compliment for something you think you suck at. 15, the girl I'm talking to right now hides her face in her jacket whenever something is super cringey. I think it's adorable. 16, put her head on my shoulder when we're just sitting.

I'm not attractive, but a girl did scream, hey, you're cute at me while I was pumping gas the other night. I'm sure she was drunk, but I'll be riding that ego boost for at least the next three months. 2, my dad started pointing out how many girls were checking me out whenever we were in public. I was always oblivious to it, mostly because I was in a long term relationship and never really cared. Initially I laughed at the notion, but a few of my girlfriends have started to point out the same. 3, when I was told I was the highest quality meat at the gym by an absolute babe, I felt so objectified. It was great. Four, in high school, my friends and I stumbled across a rally for 9 11 truthers and started to argue with them. At one point, one of the truthers got fed up and told us to go away and get a life. He turned to me and said, you're a good looking guy. Why don't you go get a girlfriend? It's rare to get that kind of compliment from someone who's pissed at you. 5, when I heard my little son 6, tell his friend, no, I do not look like my mommy, I look like my dad. We are both handsome. 6, when a few of my female friends told me, I used to have such a crush on you. In high school, in fact, a lot of girls did. I never knew about it so I never made any passes at them and went through high school thinking I looked like a potato. 7. I've had to put less and less effort into conversations over the years. 8, a really cute girl in my site class put her hand on my shoulder in a conversation once, gave it a squeeze and then glanced at my shoulder. She made this little oo sound here, eyes kind of glazed and she started just kind of holding her hand there, lightly squeezing. I was pretty uncomfortable about it at this point and asked if she was okay. She just sort of smiled and said, yeah, much better, thanks. Pats my shoulder and turns away. I asked another girl what that was about and she just said, really? Girls like hot guys. 9, when I was a kid, I never thought of myself as attractive. The boys at school and the girls made it very clear that I was a buck tooth freak. We went on holiday to Cape Town, December 1998. I was 13 then. And we were in a restaurant one day after a few days of sun and swimming and I went to the bathroom. As I was washing my hands, I looked up into the mirror and suddenly my face looked different. Guess the tan paid off well against sun bleached blonde hair. I just stared at myself and wondered if It really was me. I didn't recognize myself, shrugged it off and went back to my family. But I then started noticing that grown ass men were staring at me. It freaked me out. Boys started wanting to hang out with me on the beach. It freaked me out. I was never hot and I never wanted to be. But that was the day I realized that I wasn't a total troll.

Say your name when they say good night if it's over text. 3. Whenever my girlfriend tries to get my attention, she tugs at my shirt sleeve and says boyfriend, boyfriend. I guess it sounds weird, but I think it's the cutest thing in the world. 4. I love it when a girl stretches. Just a yawn and a stretch in the morning does it. 5. Cute little sneezes snoring and sounds they make. Sometimes even breathing can seem cute. 6. One girl that I know scrunches her nose to fix her glasses. It's adorable. 7. Mild frustration from a joke. I know, oddly specific, but I swear they try not to laugh but they can't help it so they just have a tiny fit and it's cute to me. 8. Wink at me with both of their eyes. 9. That little wiggle when they are putting on tight pants. 10. I like when they are thinking at work and put their hair over their top lip like a mustache. 11. That little dance they do when they show off a dress with pockets. 12. The way most of them giggle. IDK what it is but when you hear a woman genuinely giggle It's warming on the inside. 13. My girlfriend does this thing where she'll say something really adorable in bed that makes her feel really awkward afterwards, so she says it, then hides under the blanket afterwards. I love it. 14. It ranges from cute to attractive, but a compliment for something you think you suck at. 15. The girl I'm talking to right now hides her face in her jacket whenever something is super cringey. I think it's adorable. 16. Put her head on my shoulder when we're just sitting.

One I'm not attractive, but a girl did scream hey, you're cute! At me while I was pumping gas the other night. I'm sure she was drunk, but I'll be riding that ego boost for at least the next three months. 2. My dad started pointing out how many girls were checking me out whenever we were in public. I was always oblivious to it, mostly because I was in a long term relationship and never really cared. Initially I laughed at the notion, but a few of my girlfriends have started to point out the same. 3. When I was told I was the highest quality meat at the gym by an absolute babe, I felt so objectified. It was great. Four in high school, my friends and I stumbled across a rally for 9 11 truthers and started to argue with them. At one point, one of the truthers got fed up and told us to go away and get a life. He turned to me and said, you're a good looking guy. Why don't you go get a girlfriend? It's rare to get that kind of compliment from someone who's pissed at you. 5 when I heard my little son, 6 tell his friend, no, I do not look like my mommy, I look like my dad. We are both handsome. 6 when a few of my female friends told me, I used to have such a crush on you. In high school. In fact, a lot of girls did. I never knew about it, so I never made any passes at them and went through high school thinking I looked like a potato. Seven. I've had to put less and less effort into conversations over the years. 8 A really cute girl in my sight class put her hand on my shoulder in a conversation once, gave it a squeeze, and then glanced at my shoulder. She made this little oo sound here. Eyes kind of glazed, and she started just kind of holding her hand there, lightly squeezing. I was pretty uncomfortable about it at this point and asked if she was okay. She just sort of smiled and said, yeah, much better, thanks. Pats my shoulder and turns away. I asked another girl what that was about and she just said, really? Girls like hot guys? 9 when I was a kid, I never thought of myself as attractive. The boys at school and the girls made it very clear that I was a buck toothed freak. We went on holiday to Cape Town, December 1998. I was 13 then and we were in a restaurant one day after a few days of sun and swimming and I went to the bathroom. As I was washing my hands, I looked up into the mirror and suddenly my face looked different. Guess the tan paid off well against sun bleached blonde hair. I just stared at myself and wondered if It really was me. I didn't recognize myself, shrugged it off and went back to my family. But I then started noticing that grown ass men were staring at me. It freaked me out. Boys started wanting to hang out with me on the beach. It freaked me out. I was never hot and I never wanted to be. But that was the day I realized that I wasn't a total troll.

The vast majority of people with a first time seizure will never have another seizure again and will not need lifelong anti seizure medication. Everybody gets one freebie. 2. I once found a ladybug in my room in the middle of winter. I tried to look up if I could feed it somehow and found countless other people asking the same question. The world is full of people who have compassion enough to feed a lone bug in the winter. Three, crows will let other crows know. If you're a good person, feeding a crow in your backyard can quickly become many crows over time since the rumor spreads and nearby crows in your area will know you as one they like. They can also be known to be protective of you and even bring you gifts. Suffice to say crows are one of the most intelligent creatures on the planet and they are truly underrated. 4. There is a group of bikers called Bikers Against Child Abuse who support child abuse victims in court by looking tough and giving the kids confidence to testify against their abusers. It's actually an international group. 5, Jupiter has been protecting earth from almost every stray asteroid strike coming in from out of the solar system since the planets first formed. 6. Nurse here. If you're having a general anesthetic for a routine operation and worried about dying while under, please be aware there are about Seven different levels of stuff we can do to bring you back. So if the thing we normally do doesn't work, we've got Plan B. Then we've got Plan C, d, E, F, G and H. And we rarely need to even go to Plan C, let alone the rest. I've been qualified 15 years and it's literally never happened anywhere I've worked. 8. The ozone layer is slowly repairing itself. 9. If you quit smoking by age 40, your life expectancy is the same as a non smoker. It's never too late to quit. 10. Nobody pays all that much attention to you. Everyone is the main character in their story and thinks you're just another supporting role or an NPC. I find this very freeing. 11. Your pets will forgive you if you accidentally step on them.

This bitch was enormous. So I played it cool. I asked her, hey, want anything to drink before we head out? She says, sure. So I run in and grab my roommate and say, bro, I fucked up, I fucked up bad. I need a call like a level 10. Mom had a heart attack, dad had a stroke, your brother's in jail again, but for murder this time and it was your job to keep him out. He laughs his fucking ass off.

Men are more prone to stutter. Moderate stutter is three times more likely in men. A severe stutter, 10 times more likely. 2. Women have longer teeth than men. 3, blood flow in a man's body is more even than a woman's body. In females, blood flows more around the core in the baby making zones, which explains why women's hands and feet get colder than men. 4, only women can pass on mitochondrial DNA to their children. So if you're a male with a mitochondrial defect of some kind, the disease will end with you. 5. Women and men can have different symptoms when having a heart attack. 6, men are better able to pick up on and focus on a singular sound than women. It's really not all that useful anymore now that we've moved away from our hunter gatherer roots. But if your child is a musician in an orchestra, dad has a better chance of being able to single them out and listen to them more individually than mom. 7. Men have slightly larger veins than women, and it is easier to draw blood from men than women on average. 8, collagen fibers under the skin of men are more crisscrossy than in women, which both explains why women are more prone to cellulite and also why men have an easier time opening jars. 9, males have longer eyelashes than females do. So technically using Mascara isn't making you look more feminine, it's making you look more masculine. 10, our view is different. Women have a wider peripheral vision, making them able to spot something more quickly. Men have tunnel vision, giving them better depth perception. Eleven, the classic stereotypical female handwriting appears to have a scientific basis. Girls develop fine motor skills earlier than boys and also have a tendency to grip pens and writing implements differently, apparently due to nails, which affects their motor skills when writing. 12, men have more sweat glands than women, which is why when I come back from an hour at the gym, my shoes smell like fritos, but a girl who wears flats all day takes them off and all you smell is lotion. 13, men are four times more likely to be autistic than women. 14, men walk in a different gate to women when they stand up because they do a cheeky side step to unstick their sack from their leg.

My 31 year old girlfriend thought islands don't touch the bottom of the ocean. 2. My roommate was 21 when he Learned that cows have fur. He thought they were just skin. 3. Reindeer are a real animal. When I found out about Santa, I thought that meant reindeer weren't real. I was very much an adult when I was very confused and excited to see one in real life. 4. There's no chemical in the pool that reveals pee. A buddy and I were talking about it and we both realized at the same time that neither of us have actually seen it. We looked it up and felt dumb as hell. 5. I thought an axolotl was a fantasy creature that didn't exist. I mean you can't blame me. Just look up a picture of one and tell me that doesn't look straight out of some fantasy movie. 6. My mother used to feed me dark green lettuce as salads. I loved it even when I was a kid. I think I was 17 and I had a friend over for dinner, asked my mom for seconds of dark green lettuce. Friend looks at me like I'm a fucking idiot. Uh, you mean spinach? Mom had been fooling me my whole life. 7. As a kid I used to think the black market was an actual place, like a bazaar where all The criminals would regularly meet up. 8, I was 23 when I Learned I was allergic to apples. Someone was complaining about their throat closing up after smoking and I responded with, oh yeah, like when you eat an apple. You can imagine how the conversation went from there. 9, a few years ago, I was searching for different classical pieces in Spotify, getting frustrated that every version Spotify had of works by composers like Beethoven and Bach were covers performed by modern orchestras. My idiot brain was looking for original recordings from the 18th century until it finally realized how dumb that was. Ten, my mom used to tell me the car doesn't start if the seat belts aren't buckled. Didn't know that wasn't a real feature until I was 22, 11 that woodchucks and groundhogs are the same animal. I was somewhere in my 30s. My state called them woodchucks, so I never made the connection. When I was younger, 12, I had to tell my aunt at the age of 60 that cats and dogs cannot interbreed and create some sort of hybrid cat dog. She didn't believe me at first, so I had to tell her lots of half people, half sheep would be running around if that was the case.

One. There was this girl in high school that had fire burn scars all over her back and shoulder, but she would always either wear backless tops or her sweater off of her shoulder. The straight up confidence and aura she exuded was the sexiest thing ever. 2. I feel like a lot of guys scrolling here should know that rolling up your sleeves makes you instantly more attractive. 3. I remember fairly early on into dating my girlfriend I thought she was wearing some perfume and I asked her if she was cause I thought she smelled nice. She hadn't showered in two days. Her mom would also joke with me about how she dresses like a hobo. IDK if that counts but it's part of her charm. Four nerdy men. Like a true nerd passionate about his awesome hobby that only nerds have. Lol I didn't want to list any of said hobbies as to not offend anyone. 5. When older women have graying hair, I think some carry the look very well. 6. Not conventionally unattractive, just perhaps nobody cares about it. A few years ago I visited the Louvre and in the Egyptian wing there was some skinny, bald, and not really hot dude crouched on the floor translating hieroglyphics through the display window onto a notebook. I thought that was super hot. Seven. Shyness I guess. Everyone always says you need to be Confident to be attractive but IDK never mattered to me. If someone is socially inept I find them more genuine and relatable. 8. Women with a raspy voice. Not like chain smoker level of raspy, but if there's a slight raspiness to it, it's hot AF9. You know how some girls get all self conscious? That body hugging dresses or pencil skirts give them a little pot belly? Well that shit is hot AF10. Big noses or Roman noses on women 11. That little fat patch between boob and armpit 12. Looking unkempt and disheveled both on men and women. Like long messy hair, tired eyes, sweatpants and sports bra, a worn out coat, a scraggly beard and a cigarette like they went through some shit today. There is a fine line between looking like a gross slob in this.

Blood flow in a man's body is more even than a woman's body. In females, blood flows more around the core in the baby making zones, which explains why women's hands and feet get colder than men. 4. Only women can pass on mitochondrial DNA to their children, so if you're a male with a mitochondrial defect of some kind, the disease will end with you. Five.

Males have longer eyelashes than females do, so technically, using Mascara isn't making you look more feminine, it's making you look more masculine. 10. Our view is different. Women have a wider peripheral vision, making them able to spot something more quickly. Men have tunnel vision, giving them better depth perception. Eleven. The classic stereotypical female handwriting appears to have a scientific basis. Girls develop fine motor skills earlier than boys and also have a tendency to grip pens and writing implements differently, apparently due to nails, which affects their motor skills when writing. 12. Men have more sweat glands than women, which is why when I come back from an hour at the gym, my shoes smell like Fritos, but a girl who wears flats all day takes them off and all you smell is lotion. Thirteen. Men are four times more likely to be autistic than women. Fourteen. Men walk in a different gate to women when they stand up because they do a cheeky side step to unstick their sack from their leg.

Nests are just where they keep their eggs. Birds just sleep in trees. 2. My grandson just figured out I am his mother's mother. He just can't understand why I tell him we have to ask his mom to do some things. Why can't I just tell his mom we are going to do something? I am her mom, therefore her boss. 3. Growing up, my grandparents religiously had a three PM Pepsi time, like tea time, I guess, but with Pepsi. Every time we were over there, it happened. We all enjoyed a crisp, fizzy cold Pepsi. At 43 years old, I was telling that story this week when I suddenly realized theirs were most likely spiked. 4. Soft drinks are called soft drinks because they don't contain alcohol. Hard drinks do. Five, when getting an eye exam, you are asked which looks better, one or two. If they are identical or too close to call, you have a third option. The same. They never told me that. 6. Eminem calls himself Eminem because his name is Marshall Mathers. 7. That they call it footage because film is measured in feet. 8. About 10 years ago, I got a Logitech Wave keyboard and mouse. I love them and use them until they wore out. Recently, I bought a New Wave set. The new set was almost the same, but the scroll wheel on the mouse. Spun freely instead of clicking, this made scrolling through websites easier, but was hard for precise tasks like switching weapons in games. I've been using it for a month. Today I discovered the button below the scroll wheel changes it from free spin to clicking. I didn't know this, and it made my day.

One. My dad asked a black female employee at Walmart for some help with picking a good watermelon. You look like you would probably know what's the best watermelon. His intentions were to be I've seen you in produce many times. You seem to be the person to ask advice on choosing what is best to buy. He didn't realize his mistake until he was watching TV hours later and refused to go back for two months. Two. I wanted Indian food. My friends wanted Italian. After sitting down at an Italian restaurant, I open the menu and joke I don't see any Indian food. I look up at our Indian waiter asking for our orders. Ah. 3. Sergeant friend of mine had a dead battery and asked a helpful black man for a slave. In the army, a slave cable is a specialized jumper cable designed to work on military vehicles. So asking for a slave is like asking for a jump. Nice civilian guy did not know this and just thought my friend was being a racist prick. 4. I told my coworker he had gorilla hands. He's black. As soon as I said it, I had a JD moment from scrubs where I just screamed internally for 10 straight seconds. 5. My brother, picking up a black Hyundai Accent at the address he was given, walks up to front desk of the office building. Hey, uh, I'm looking for a guy with An accent. Girl at front desk. Oh, what kind of accent? Thinks a moment I don't know. A black 1 6 when I worked as a summer camp counselor, we gave themed awards to our campers at the end of the week. One week, I choose Harry Potter as my theme. I gave the only black kid in my cabin the serious Black Award. 7 I was on the bus to school and I saw an old friend from a previous school. He's black and I'm white, and we had a pretty cool catch up. However, when he was about to get off the bus, being the smooth guy I am, my brain tried to say both see you and bye at the same time. The result was me shouting at a black dude on a busy bus, I'll buy you! Yikes!

They laughed. 3. I heard my neighbor giving his granddaughter a xylophone for her birthday. I guess she could play it well and kept playing for a while. Immediately after she left, I could hear him trying to play something his granddaughter had played. He practiced for a solid hour until he managed to play the song correctly and stopped with a joyful yes. It was one of the purest things I've ever experienced. 4.

You were only with me for the crack. My next door neighbors. 6, what can only be described as my flatmate having phone sex while using Christian Bale's Batman voice. 7, I moved from far away, so I have a different state license plate than everyone else at the apartment complex. A couple of days ago, I overheard my upstairs neighbor drunkenly ranting to his wife about what he thinks I'm up to. He's convinced I'm on the run from something. I'm just in grad school, lol. 8.

It had been pretty common over the previous couple of weeks. This time, though, someone came in and started screaming, you are having sex in my bed. Turns out the daughter had been skipping school and coming back to the apartment with her boyfriend. They were the ones having sex in the mom's bed.

When I ordered a small drink, it was actually small. 2. The only thing that really surprised me was how much pedestrians trusted cars to not hit them. 3. The age of all the buildings. Walked into a pub in the UK with a plaque that reads something like, this building was constructed in the year 2 and was used by monks to fend off dinosaurs. Maybe not the exact words, but you get it. 4. I went to Scotland, ran across some German tourists who asked us to translate what the Scott was saying. We were all three speaking English. They just couldn't understand each other. 5. You hear about how big the Roman Empire was and all the advanced building tech they had, but it doesn't really sink in until you see it with your own eyes. 6. In France, people get two hour lunches. Like some stores will have two separate open and close times cause they'll just shut down for two hours a day to enjoy themselves. Most people seemed much happier and relaxed as a whole. 7. That tax was included on the price tag. 8. I'm Dutch, but I'll never forget my American girlfriend's reaction to seeing rows and rows of parked bicycles in front of the train station when she came to visit the Netherlands. Oh my god, look at all those bikes. 9 in Italy, the shower at one of My hotels had no barriers to keep the water in one general area. It was just a drain in the floor. Luckily, it was just that one, and it was definitely an older hotel. 10, the amount of public transportation, and in many places, people not driving or not even knowing how to drive. Even young children were using public transportation, not escorted by adults to get to school. Eleven, I heard a story of a lady who was dumbfounded that there weren't going to be fireworks celebrating the 4th of July. Couldn't conceive the idea that other countries don't celebrate America's Independence Day. 12, I was in Switzerland for a few days. I felt like the fattest person in the country at 6 feet, 210 pounds. 13. Personal bubble is very different. It shocks you at first and you feel sort of claustrophobic, but then you get used to it. Two, it's kind of subtle until you come back to the States and unconsciously stand so close to someone else in a line that they start shooting you dirty looks.

One, in high school, I woke up on a day where very icy weather was expected and couldn't find school closings on TV. I begrudgingly got ready for school, stepped out my front door and immediately slipped on ice, landing flat on my back. Got up, shook it off and cursed the school for not being closed. I had to crawl my way up a hill to the bus stop because I kept slipping down ice on the way there. Got to the bus stop and waited over half an hour for it to get there. Check my watch repeatedly, getting more and more angry each time. Finally decide that they must have canceled school and slowly make it back home where I see a clock. It was now 2:00am. 2. I once was cooking Mac and cheese and started squeezing the cheese sauce in before draining the water. When I realized the mistake, I grabbed the cheese sauce with my hands and it just made everything worse in every way. 3, birthday is March 12th. In high school, I saw that my birthday was going to fall on a Thursday, so I was like, oh wow, Thursday the 12th. I proceeded to scan the next couple of decades on my iPod touch calendar to find out if my birthday would ever fall on Friday the 13th. 4. I recently went to pick up an order of glasses. The optician asked me To try them on to see if they fit well. I told him this must be someone else's order because everything was blurry. He was surprised and started hunting through boxes and I kept squinting and looking around at blurry shapes. We did this for 10 minutes before the optometrist walked in. He explained the issue and the optometrist paused and asked where I put the glasses I was wearing when I walked in. I said I was wearing contacts. I was wearing contacts and I put the new glasses over my contacts. I asked the optometrist if this gave me double the perfect vision and she replied, if you mean double vision, sure. 5. During the holidays, I walked through an arts and crafts store trying to find something very specific. After finding out they didn't have it, I got in a long line to check out.

One, in high school, I woke up on a day where very icy weather was expected and couldn't find school closings on TV. I begrudgingly got ready for school, stepped out my front door and immediately slipped on ice, landing flat on my back. Got up, shook it off and cursed the school for not being closed. I had to crawl my way up a hill to the bus stop because I kept slipping down ice on the way there. Got to the bus stop and waited over half an hour for it to get there. Check my watch repeatedly, getting more and more angry each time. Finally decide that they must have canceled school and slowly make it back home where I see a clock. It was now 2:00am. 2. I once was cooking Mac and cheese and started squeezing the cheese sauce in before draining the water. When I realized the mistake, I grabbed the cheese sauce with my hands and it just made everything worse in every way. 3, birthday is March 12th. In high school, I saw that my birthday was going to fall on a Thursday, so I was like, oh wow, Thursday the 12th. I proceeded to scan the next couple of decades on my iPod touch calendar to find out if my birthday would ever fall on Friday the 13th. 4. I recently went to pick up an order of glasses. The optician asked me To try them on to see if they fit well. I told him this must be someone else's order because everything was blurry. He was surprised and started hunting through boxes and I kept squinting and looking around at blurry shapes. We did this for 10 minutes before the optometrist walked in. He explained the issue and the optometrist paused and asked where I put the glasses I was wearing when I walked in. I said I was wearing contacts. I was wearing contacts and I put the new glasses over my contacts. I asked the optometrist if this gave me double the perfect vision and she replied, if you mean double vision, sure. 5. During the holidays, I walked through an arts and crafts store trying to find something very specific. After finding out they didn't have it, I got in a long line to check out. It didn't hit me that I didn't have anything to buy until it was my turn. I just walked past the cashier, waved and said, have a nice day. It was night f my life. 6, wondering if lime was real word or if I made it up.

Just for context, I'm Polish. I truly believe that Americans have this weird thing about believing in themselves. For example, I don't believe I will become the person I wanna be. I don't believe I will achieve anything in my life. I don't believe I will be happy in my life. Then I watch people from America who believe they can do anything and they just go for it. Does it always work? No, but it gives them a way higher chance than mine when I don't believe. Two, 21 years ago, the United States was able to deploy forces halfway across the world, roll into Baghdad and conquer Iraq in less than one month with only a few hundred American deaths. By contrast, Russia still hasn't even gotten to Kiev after three years of fighting, despite Ukraine being Russia's neighbor. And Russia has suffered 750,000 dead and wounded in the process. 3. Enthusiasm. I live in Ireland and we're all miserable pricks, as are most Europeans. But when we meet Americans, we're always amazed at the enthusiasm and energy they have for even the most mundane stuff. I once saw a bunch of American tourists shout, oh, freaking hell yeah, let's go, and high five each other because they managed to fit all their luggage and groceries into the car. If that was me and my buds, we'd be like, ah, nice. Four national parks courtesy of Theodore Roosevelt. 5. I could be wrong, but I'm in Australia and I love the way Americans go all out for holidays, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas. It all looks so fun.

One starlight from the boys. At first I thought it was CGI and part of her character, but then I realized she's had horrible surgery. She looks so much better in the earlier seasons, but now she looks drastically different, almost unrecognizable. 2. Simon Cowell I feel like Simon Cowell from 20 years ago would ridicule and lambaste current Simon worse than he ever did with any crazy X Factor or American Idol contestant. His excessive plastic surgery has altered his appearance significantly. 3. The Kardashian Jenner clan they immediately come to mind. A lot of younger celebrities seem to be following the trend of overusing fillers and Botox. Combined with buckle fat removal, it's aging them horribly, making them look middle aged well before they turn 34. Lindsay Lohan. I know she's been through a lot, but the plastic surgery hasn't helped. She was one of the first people my age that I saw undergo extensive cosmetic work, and it was sobering to witness the transformation. 5. Ariana Grande she's still really young and started out naturally beautiful, but she's already started looking a bit uncanny. You don't usually see this level of plastic surgery until someone reaches their 40s. It's surprising and a little disheartening.

One, Calum. I remember seeing a TikTok where an American was saying how rare their kid's name is and the kid was called Calum. 2, Gemma is quite British. My daughter is a Gemma. She moved to the US as a teen. Her school principal did not know how to pronounce her name and insisted on saying it with a hard G. She was not a happy bunny. Three, Alfie and Imogen. They're just so British. 4, Gavin spent ages looking for one in America once. 5, opposite to your question, but a name you won't hear in UK but will in America is Randy. Was thinking how odd it was just yesterday I could never keep a straight face when the radio mentioned the Eighty's singer Randy Vanwormer. I mean, come on. Six, I've heard of posh people called Saint John pronounced Sinjin. Never met one myself, but that sounds like it's got to be a British only thing. 7. Alvin. Definitely Alvin, 100% British. 8. As an American, I attended my British cousin's wedding and was shocked that there were like four Gemmas. I had never met a Gemma before, but I had seen shows with characters named Gemma. 9, Rupert. 10, a load of Welsh names like Bronwyn, although I'm surprised they haven't had a big explosion in America for wanting more unique names. 11, I met an American named Mivanui. She wasn't happy when I pronounced her Name in the Welsh way after reading it on her passport. I find it genuinely bizarre that you'd pick a name from a defined culture and somehow still not bother to learn how to pronounce it.

If they bang their hands on their knees as they get up from a seated position and then say right. 2. Ask them how they are. If they reply with can't complain, not bad or alright, they're 100% British. 3. It takes them forever to leave. 4. If you ask them about Fredo, they start to complain about how expensive they are now and how many you used to buy for a quid. Yeah, Froggy got expensive. 5. They describe things as dodgy, decent, middle class. 6. The question you alright? Is not actually them asking if you're okay. Seven they have beans on toast for breakfast. Eight. Walk up to them and say auto glass repair. If they finish it, they're Brits. Nine. They have their clothes washer in the kitchen, it's a standard. 10. Tell them you like their pants and watch how they react. I did this to my boss and he got the funniest look on his face. Then he laughed. I asked him what was so funny. Then he told me pants means underwear in Britain. 11. Warm up your tea in the microwave, watch how they react. 12. We all have our lucky 10 pound note given to us by the Queen when we turn five years of age. 13. That they're either super nice and well mannered one minute or sailors another minute. There's no in between. 14. Everything is pudding. I Was so confused the first time I went out for dinner in London, the waiter said, we have four different puddings tonight. I was like, wow, how odd that this restaurant only has various flavours of pudding for dessert. 15 call my cookie a biscuit again and I'm telling mum. 16 if you go out in a pub and it takes roughly 30 seconds to find some mates to chat with, they are Brits. 17 shout 0 8, 0 0, 0 0.

One. Letting your cat outside. Americans can't possibly imagine that in another country. This is very much a normal thing. The UK just doesn't have the predators the US does. No coyote, snake, Eddie or Mountain Lion is going to unalive a UK cat. The only enemy of the cat in the UK is the car. Two Christmas crackers. We're so used to them here that it is a shock to learn other countries don't do them. When my American brother in law was coming to England for Christmas for the first time, his friend said to him, do you know in England they sit round and wear paper crowns at Christmas? He thought his friend was lying until we all pulled the crackers. It amused me, especially as I thought everywhere did crackers until that point. Three no gaps around public toilet doors. I have never understood why you would ever want to catch a glimpse of someone taking a dookie. It's properly strange. 4. Pronouncing the H in herbs. I get ridiculously irritated with the H less pronunciation. 5. Having tax included in prices. Six walking places. I remember seeing a thread where Americans were freaking out and calling a woman an a hole because she and her son walked to his primary school instead of getting an Uber. 7. Not being bankrupted after visiting the hospital. Like free healthcare must be nice. 8 apparently Americans don't use kettles. I can't imagine life without one, to be honest. 9. Crossing the road wherever I like, whenever I like, without being arrested. 10. Yaffa Cakes. In my experience, Americans don't like the mix of chocolate and orange. 11. Washing machines in the kitchen. Twelve. Walking from any hotel or retail park to other establishments. Got dropped off at a retail park in the US by taxi. Tried and failed to walk across to a store on the other side. Three lane each way road with no pedestrian crossing in the way. Got taxi back to hotel.

One. I had a really good, hard working employee. Always on time, picked up other shifts, great personality. The thing was, he was a nice guy. You know, the guy who was always friend zoned and a little awkward around girls, so he very rarely got any dates. One day he was scheduled to work with me in an hour. The phone rings, I answer and it's him. He's nervous but excited. Tells me he's at a coffee shop and he had started talking to this really pretty girl and she was actually interested in hanging out with him. Asked if there was any way someone could cover his shift. I laughed a little, then realized he was serious. Fuck it. I told him to go out and have a great time and I would figure it out. I honestly thought the next time I saw him he would be all depressed because it didn't work out. Two days later I see him at work and he tells me they're dating. He couldn't stop talking about her the entire shift. For the next few months he worked for me, they were still together and had a great relationship after he left the company. I have no idea what happened, but I really hope it lasted two. I got stabbed and I can't make it in today, but I'll be there Tomorrow, this dude really got mugged and stabbed in the arm and still came into work the next day? Three. This would be from the other side. My mom died, and I had to phone her work to tell them. I called the store manager, and when he picked up the phone, I explained that I was Charlotte's daughter. He was a complete dick to me and said in a really condescending, rude tone of voice, oh, so she can't phone me to tell me why she didn't come to work yesterday? I very quietly told him that, no, she couldn't phone to explain herself because she was dead. There was complete silence on the line. He sputtered something and said HR would be in contact with me.

Let's look at what it may have looked like. Corbyn's plan for his first day as PM was to, on the steps of Downing Street, announced that his gov is going to end homelessness in the UK through a range of property purchases as well as long term investment in services such as frontline mental health. The Labour Gov would also immediately guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in Britain and call the then Chancellor of Germany to kickstart Brexit talks. The idea here would likely be a softer form of Brexit and maintaining of a lot of framework, but it would likely be paired with an emphasis on how the UK can now develop workers rights and wider social and economic policy. The flip side of this is the implication that the EU is guilty of prioritizing on business interests. Brexit would be an opportunity for the UK to pass legislation that strengthens workers rights, even if it steps on the toes of big business. I'd imagine we would probably be a bit like Norway, outside yet close and involved while paying for some access. Things would be a lot friendlier emo. There would also be an emergency budget and as part of that the government would increase them in wage and scrap tuition fees. This would not be a quick process. At the same time The establishment would go into overdrive to frame smear him. The right wing of the Labor Party would be weaker but still a powerful block. Leaks and stepping on toes wouldn't be rare. Emo. The media would close ranks to play up every issue and downplay every success. Respectable papers would run opinion pieces about how it's a bad thing to invest in public transport because a pundit thinks buses and working class people are scary. In the future, deeper reform like proportional representation may also forever change the political landscape and break the grip on power that the Tories have. Voting reform may also strengthen smaller parties or allow for new ones to emerge. While the large parties, including Labour and especially the Tories may take a hit, The Labour Party itself would likely be financially better off and have a larger active membership. It was doing well under Corbin as the party grew to be the largest in Europe. A lot of people ended their membership when Corbin went and a few unions unaffiliated. This hurts their ability to get activists and campaigners out and takes away a big chunk of funding. Under the right wing of the iffy. They also tend to waste the money they do have.

All I will say is that it is wildly unacceptable and any competent administration would have been ejected from his position before the end of the day. If a member of Biden's administration did this in 2020, the outrage from the right would be off the charts. 7. Just a reminder that I believe his grandparents were associated with the same radical ideologies. And that his dad gave him a name from a SCI fi book written by someone with similar values. Werner von Braun. 8. They've won. They don't have to hide. I have friends and family members laughing it off saying it's a joke or that he is weird, and it's him saying his heart goes out to those who support him. I'm not kidding. We're cooked. Nine if you're surprised, you haven't been paying attention. 10. Texted my dad the Video of him doing the salute, him being a Trump supporter, had the following explanations. There was nothing bad about his salute. He did it. But he was showing where we were versus where we are going. It was actually hail to the chief. That's a song. Oh, yeah. But Joe Biden is a commie. I have never been so disappointed in my own father.

One. Rebel Wilson. She was funny in the beginning, but rode the fat funny friend trope way too far in every movie. It's so sad. Same with Melissa McCarthy. But at least I feel like Melissa can truly act. She's just stuck in the trope. They both tend to play similar fat slob characters repeatedly. Two. Chris Pratt. Hear me out. He did amazing work on TV. Andy from parks and recreation is an amazing character, and he was great in that role, but since becoming a leading man, he's become wooden. It's like he has this idea of what a leading man should be, and that's all he does in every film. Three. Everybody loves Danny Trejo, but he only ever plays Danny Trejo. To be fair, nobody but Danny Trejo could ever play Danny Trejo. 4. You know that movie where Michael Cera plays the awkward teenager? Yeah, that's basically every movie he's in. Five. Might get some hate for this, but Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart in every movie. He's hilarious and works well in the roles he's in, and I have nothing against the guy, but I don't think his acting has much range. 6. Jared Leto, Will Smith's kids, and many others come to mind, but they often get into acting through nepotism. Many of them come from rich families that helped open doors for them in Hollywood.

One. Silly bands. I worked in retail at the time. After they initially sold out, by the time we got new stock in, nobody wanted them anymore. They all got cleared out. Probably because schools banned them almost immediately. 2. The sea shanty craze. Remember that one random week when everyone was suddenly into sea shanties for some reason? Three Segways does the existence of the Segway count as a trend? It was hyped as the future of transportation, but it never really caught on. 4. The 3D craze. Around 2010 everyone thought 3D was the future. After Avatar came out, every movie tried to be 3d. Then came 3d TVs, 3d phones, and a Nintendo 3ds. The craze died out in about a year, likely because it gave people headaches and was more of a gimmick than an improvement. 5. The summer of Pokemon Go the summer of Pokemon Go was incredible. People were up and outside walking around, getting exercise, strangers met and chatted, and for a brief moment it was cool to be social. Then, if I remember correctly, an app update broke the game and its popularity dropped off drastically. Ironically, about four years later, COVID 19 happened and we were all stuck indoors. A complete opposite of that one wonderful summer of Pokemon Go.

My daughter was the prettiest girl in high school and she always had boys showing up at our house hoping to confess their love. She rejected all of them, but unfortunately, one of the boys didn't take it well. He started harassing her everywhere. He would hide in a tree near our house and as soon as my daughter left for school, he would follow her, claiming it was to keep her safe. But one day, my daughter caught him taking photos through her bedroom window. Even at school, he never left her alone and would constantly invade her personal space, saying that friends should hug each other often. I reported his behavior to the teachers, but they said they couldn't control what a student did outside of school. They promised to try and stop the bullying, but things only got worse from there. He started showing up at our house, knocking on my daughter's window when I wasn't home, demanding to be let in. He spread rumors that they were hooking up every day and insisted they were obviously soulmates, all in an attempt to pressure my daughter into dating him. One day he took things way too far. I had just left for work when he decided to break my daughter's window and force his way into the house. He started screaming for her to stop hiding, saying that he would only hurt her if she resisted. He was laughing the entire Time acting like he was invincible. What he didn't know, however, was that I had taught my daughter how to defend herself in situations like this. She ran to the kitchen and grabbed the biggest knife she could find. Then she hid it behind her back and calmly asked him to leave. The boy didn't listen. He charged at her and in that moment, she reacted, impaling him in the stomach. He died from blood loss shortly after. My daughter was only 16 at the time. Although this experience was deeply traumatic for her, she was never charged with murder. The incident was ruled as self defense.

One when my ex and I got into dumb arguments or debates, we'd send it to council for review. There was no council. There would be no review. It was our way of shelving an argument that would never have a winner. Occasionally, we'd ask each other if we heard back from council about the judgment. Two. My husband and I have a game we call business, business. The goal is to clasp the other person's right hand, fully shake it twice, and say business, business. If the other person pulls their hand away or shouts business, business at the same time, it's a failed attempt. There's no score, but the last successful handshake holder is the reigning champion until dethroned. This started as an inside joke, but has spiraled into a full on competition, including notable wins, like at my uncle's funeral while reaching for a water bottle in the middle of the desert, and during heated arguments. Now whenever we try to hold hands, there's always a moment of hesitation to ensure it's not a ploy. 3. When the laundry comes out of the dryer, my partner dumps the warm pile on me, and I sort socks and underwear from inside the heap. Meanwhile, he hangs up shirts and folds pants. We call it Laundry Turtle. 4. He absolutely must touch my butt at least once every time we go to Walmart. I can't even remember how This started, but it feels weird if we forget. 5. We have a dollar Bill that fell between the washer and dryer during laundry one day. Neither of us could be bothered to fish it out, so we left it there for over a year. Eventually we acknowledged it and decided to leave it as a symbol of our wealth. We've added a quarter to it now it's our emergency fund. 6. We wrestle for fun. Not in a sexy or playful let the other one way, but as a legit competition. 7. We often stand in each other's way for no reason other than to be annoying. 8. We have a mating dance that has evolved over the decade we've been together. It includes moves like slapping one's own butt, moving arms like a Choo Choo train, and one handed clapping. Some moves go out of fashion year by year, but our repertoire is significant.

He would hide in a tree near our house and as soon as my daughter left for school, he would follow her, claiming it was to keep her safe. But one day, my daughter caught him taking photos through her bedroom window. Even at school, he never left her alone and would constantly invade her personal space, saying that friends should hug each other often. I reported his behavior to the teachers, but they said they couldn't control what a student did outside of school. They promised to try and stop the bullying, but things only got worse from there. He started showing up at our house, knocking on my daughter's window when I wasn't home, demanding to be let in. He spread rumors that they were hooking up every day and insisted they were obviously soulmates, all in an attempt to pressure my daughter into dating him. One day he took things way too far. I had just left for work when he decided to break my daughter's window and force his way into the house. He started screaming for her to stop hiding, saying that he would only hurt her if she resisted. He was laughing the entire Time acting like he was invincible. What he didn't know, however, was that I had taught my daughter how to defend herself in situations like this. She ran to the kitchen and grabbed the biggest knife she could find. Then she hid it behind her back and calmly asked him to leave. The boy didn't listen. He charged at her and in that moment, she reacted, impaling him in the stomach. He died from blood loss shortly after. My daughter was only 16 at the time. Although this experience was deeply traumatic for her, she was never charged with murder. The incident was ruled as self defense.

One, Rebel Wilson. She was funny in the beginning but rode the fat funny friend trope way too far in every movie. It's so sad. Same with Melissa McCarthy, but at least I feel like Melissa can truly act. She's just stuck in the trope. They both tend to play similar fat slob characters repeatedly. 2, Chris Pratt, hear me out. He did amazing work on TV. Andy from parks and recreation is an amazing character, and he was great in that role. But since becoming a leading man, he's become wooden. It's like he has this idea of what a leading man should be and that's all he does in every film. 3, everybody loves Danny Trae Ho, but he only ever plays Danny Trae Ho. To be fair, nobody but Danny Trae Ho could ever play Danny Trae Ho. 4, you know that movie where Michael Cera plays the awkward teenager? Yeah, that's basically every movie he's in. 5. Might get some hate for this, but Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart in every movie. He's hilarious and works well in the roles he's in. And I have nothing against the guy, but I don't think his acting has much range. 6, Jared Leto, Will Smith's kids and many others come to mind, but they often get into acting through nepotism. Many of them come from rich families that helped open doors for them in Hollywood.

Knowledge is so vast that they can talk about in the easiest way for someone else to understand. 4. They spend time thinking before asking a question or answering. 1. 5. They're very good at problem solving, even if it's something they have no experience with. They always approach the problem from the right angle. 6. They can genuinely consider an idea which opposes their world view without necessarily accepting it. 7. They can switch up the way they talk to match the person they're talking to without sounding condescending. They listen to how others learn and explain it in that person's language of understanding. 8. They aren't afraid to say they don't know the answer to a question. 9. Understanding or appreciating nuance. 10. They are okay with being perceived as stupid by asking questions. If we hold back in fear we'll never truly learn. Plus it's a good way to show others it's okay to question things if you don't understand. Better off if we're on the same page instead of hoping things work out without being informed.

One, the person you strapped yourself to for a tandem skydive was up until 3:00am doing cookies last night. Two, the best time to buy a car is the second model year of its release. Year one, it's patchwork to just get them off the line. Year two, everything is fixed and has quality content. Year three, plus Oems give incentives to make parts cheaper and to discontent to improve margins. 3. Sometimes when a job is posted and the requirements are unrealistic, that's because they already have someone that needs to be promoted to that specific position and they simply tailor that job ad so only that person qualifies even if hundreds of people apply. 4. Political propaganda. TV hosts and speakers don't believe that shit themselves and are very cynical about it like it's just a job like any other. 5. The signal strength bars on your phone don't mean anything real. Each phone manufacturer comes up with their own secret formula. It might change between software versions and it's just a holdover from the old first generation analog phones.

Many therapists need therapy themselves, sometimes a lot of it. 7. The massive professional quality cinema projectors that movie theaters. Use the ones that can project crystal clear 4 K+ images. The ones linked to top notch surround systems that make movies come to life. The ones so big they have a giant exhaust hose. They have regular HDMI ports on the side. 8, utility construction, primarily fiber.

I worked in retail at the time. After they initially sold out, by the time we got new stock in, nobody wanted them anymore. They all got cleared out, probably because schools banned them almost immediately. 2, the sea shanty craze. Remember that one random week when everyone was suddenly into sea shanties for some reason? 3, Segways. Does the existence of the Segway count as a trend? It was hyped as the future of transportation, but it never really caught on. 4, the 3D craze. Around 2010, everyone thought 3D was the future. After Avatar came out, every movie tried to be 3D. Then came 3d TVs, 3D phones, and a Nintendo 3Ds. The craze died out in about a year, likely because it gave people headaches and was more of a gimmick than an improvement. 5. The summer of Pokemon Go. The summer of Pokemon Go was incredible. People were up and outside walking around, getting exercise. Strangers met and chatted. And for a brief moment, it was cool to be social. Then, if I remember correctly, an app update broke the game and its popularity dropped off drastically. Ironically, about four years later, Covid 19 happened and we were all stuck indoors. A complete opposite of that one wonderful summer of Pokemon Go.

One when my ex and I got into dumb arguments or debates, we'd send it to council for review. There was no council. There would be no review. It was our way of shelving an argument that would never have a winner. Occasionally, we'd ask each other if we heard back from council about the judgment. Two. My husband and I have a game we call business, business. The goal is to clasp the other person's right hand, fully shake it twice, and say business, business. If the other person pulls their hand away or shouts business, business at the same time, it's a failed attempt. There's no score, but the last successful handshake holder is the reigning champion until dethroned. This started as an inside joke, but has spiraled into a full on competition, including notable wins, like at my uncle's funeral while reaching for a water bottle in the middle of the desert, and during heated arguments. Now whenever we try to hold hands, there's always a moment of hesitation to ensure it's not a ploy. 3. When the laundry comes out of the dryer, my partner dumps the warm pile on me, and I sort socks and underwear from inside the heap. Meanwhile, he hangs up shirts and folds pants. We call it Laundry Turtle. 4. He absolutely must touch my butt at least once every time we go to Walmart. I can't even remember how This started, but it feels weird if we forget. 5. We have a dollar Bill that fell between the washer and dryer during laundry one day. Neither of us could be bothered to fish it out, so we left it there for over a year. Eventually we acknowledged it and decided to leave it as a symbol of our wealth. We've added a quarter to it now it's our emergency fund. 6. We wrestle for fun. Not in a sexy or playful let the other one way, but as a legit competition. 7. We often stand in each other's way for no reason other than to be annoying. 8. We have a mating dance that has evolved over the decade we've been together. It includes moves like slapping one's own butt, moving arms like a Choo Choo train, and one handed clapping. Some moves go out of fashion year by year, but our repertoire is significant.

When I ordered a small drink, it was actually small. 2. The only thing that really surprised me was how much pedestrians trusted cars to not hit them. 3. The age of all the buildings. Walked into a pub in the UK with a plaque that reads something like, this building was constructed in the year 2 and was used by monks to fend off dinosaurs. Maybe not the exact words, but you get it. 4. I went to Scotland, ran across some German tourists who asked us to translate what the Scott was saying. We were all three speaking English. They just couldn't understand each other. 5. You hear about how big the Roman Empire was and all the advanced building tech they had, but it doesn't really sink in until you see it with your own eyes. 6. In France, people get two hour lunches. Like some stores will have two separate open and close times cause they'll just shut down for two hours a day to enjoy themselves. Most people seemed much happier and relaxed as a whole. 7. That tax was included on the price tag. 8. I'm Dutch, but I'll never forget my American girlfriend's reaction to seeing rows and rows of parked bicycles in front of the train station when she came to visit the Netherlands. Oh my god, look at all those bikes. 9 in Italy, the shower at one of My hotels had no barriers to keep the water in one general area. It was just a drain in the floor. Luckily, it was just that one, and it was definitely an older hotel. 10, the amount of public transportation, and in many places, people not driving or not even knowing how to drive. Even young children were using public transportation, not escorted by adults to get to school. Eleven, I heard a story of a lady who was dumbfounded that there weren't going to be fireworks celebrating the 4th of July. Couldn't conceive the idea that other countries don't celebrate America's Independence Day. 12, I was in Switzerland for a few days. I felt like the fattest person in the country at 6 feet, 210 pounds. 13. Personal bubble is very different. It shocks you at first and you feel sort of claustrophobic, but then you get used to it. Two, it's kind of subtle until you come back to the States and unconsciously stand so close to someone else in a line that they start shooting you dirty looks.

Two, I was riding my bike and passed by a guy going the opposite way on a unicycle. As we passed, he said, f in two Wheeler. 3, grocery store. I know how to buy eggs, Diane. I've done it before. I could not stop saying this for the rest of the day. I was a real joy to be around. 4, a pregnant woman at Walmart talking to a cashier said, yeah, I'm getting a DUI after this one. No more kids. Of course, she meant IUD, but the lady didn't correct her and I cried laughing. Maybe it was pregnancy brain. Five, guy next to me at a urinal farted once and loudly says, sometimes when it rains, it thunders. I stole it. 6, I was sitting on the patio at a bar one afternoon just watching birds and enjoying a few drinks alone. Next to me was a group of older folks around retirement age just hanging out. They were talking about all kinds of things. I'd drift in and out of listening to them. When I heard one man talking about his doctor, he said the doctor had passed away two years prior in almost a depressed tone. The other Men told him, don't be so sad, man. It's not like he was your wife or anything. And without skipping a beat, the man replied, I know I shouldn't be so upset, but man, he just gave really good prostate exams. The entire table started cracking up. I nearly spit my drink out from laughing so hard. And the man pointed at me and said, see, he gets it. 7, I was walking along 10th Street in Brooklyn when a man walked by on his phone and all I caught of his conversation was, I don't know, I've never owned a effing giraffe before. Eight, I was teaching a 5 year old drum lessons at a studio and I wrote the word rhythm on the board, pointing at it. I asked him if he knew how to say this word. He stared at it for five seconds and said, I can't read. 9, guy at a pet store feeds a goldfish to a tank full of turtles. Turtles go nuts. Me? Wow. Do they always get this excited about food?

In my first apartment, my parents came to visit and I said freak when I hit my head on the open door of the freezer while standing up from grabbing something from the fridge. My mother said, you can't talk like that in my home and stopped mid sentence. I pointed at her and said, yeah, that's right, mom, shut your mouth. 2. I taught my 6th grade students about democratic processes and we ran a simulation without fail. Every one of my classes tried to impeach me. 3, a coworker friend of mine was flying back from a sales conference in Vegas and he was able to upgrade to a first class seat. We had this obnoxious sales VP that was on the same flight. She was the snobby entitled type with a full time nanny and giant Mcmansion in the suburbs and she generally treated people who worked for her like servants. She sees him in a first class seat as she is making her way to coach and asks him how he got that seat. As people are getting settled in, she makes her way back up to the first class cabin and asks to speak with a lead flight attendant. She tells him that one of her underlings is sitting in first class and that she needs to switch with him since she's higher on the corporate ladder. The guy can't Believe what he's hearing, but she won't take no for an answer. Finally, he tells her she has to go back to her seat or she will be escorted from the plane. She made a complete joke of herself in front of the whole first class cabin 4. When I was in high school, I worked at a popular warehouse club selling computers on weekends. I was hired by the store manager through a friend's referral. I loved computers, so my job was to stay in the computer department and sell them, nothing else. One shift manager didn't like that and insisted I needed to go fold clothes for half my shift. I told him the store manager instructed me never to leave the technology department, but he insisted. This went on for several weeks. The store manager showed up one weekend when we were both working. He slapped a stack of green bar paper, this was a while ago, onto a shelf and pointed to some highlighted numbers. He looked at the shift manager and said, do you see this? This is our average tech sales when you're on shift. See this number over here? This is our average tech sales when you're not. At this point, it would be more cost effective to simply fire you. What do you think? The guy stammered like a toddler caught bullying another kid. Fortunately, he wasn't fired, but the store manager made it clear that when I was on shift, I Was not to leave the tech department unless I was on break or there was a fire. That shift manager never said another word to me.

I was a real joy to be around. 4 A pregnant woman at Walmart talking to a cashier, said, yeah, I'm getting a DUI. After this one, no more kids. Of course she meant IUD, but the lady didn't correct her and I cried laughing. Maybe it was pregnancy brain. Five. Guy next to me at a urinal farted once and loudly says, sometimes when it rains, it thunders. I stole it. Six. I was sitting on the patio at a bar one afternoon, just watching birds and enjoying a few drinks alone. Next to me was a group of older folks around retirement age, just hanging out. They were talking about all kinds of things. I'd drift in and out of listening to them. When I heard one man talking about his doctor. He said the doctor had passed away two years prior in almost a depressed tone. The other Men told him, don't be so sad, man. It's not like he was your wife or anything. And without skipping a beat, the man replied, I know I shouldn't be so upset, but, man, he just gave really good prostate exams. The entire table started cracking up. I nearly spit my drink out from laughing so hard. And the man pointed at me and said, see? He gets it. 7. I was walking along 10th Street in Brooklyn when a man walked by on his phone, and all I caught of his conversation was, I don't know. I've never owned a effing giraffe. Before eight, I was teaching a five year old drum lessons at a studio, and I wrote the word rhythm on the board. Pointing at it, I asked him if he knew how to say this word. He stared at it for five seconds and said, I can't read. Nine. Guy at a pet store feeds a goldfish to a tank full of turtles. Turtles go nuts. Me wow, do they always get this excited about food?

We survive so well that we can freely complain about survival not being to our liking. 2. The concept of pets. We capture other species not to eat or enslave them, but to be friends with them. 3. We can reflect on the fact that we exist. 4. Sometimes I wonder if other animals think humans are ugly. Like those weird hairless cats. We just have this tuft of hair on top and the rest is naked. While we somehow find each other attractive, I wouldn't be surprised if animals thought look at those weird, almost hairless things walking on two feet. So gross. Five. On Halloween we sometimes dress up like the skeletons inside our own bodies. 6. How easily we lose track of reality. A friend of mine once asked me for the $10 I owed him, only to realize he had dreamt that he'd lend it to me. 7. Humans are insanely tough. A lot of animals go into shock and die from injuries humans routinely bounce back from. Many of the flavors we enjoy come from poisons we're immune to. Humans are better at hot weather and long distance running than any other animal. An ancient hunting method involved jogging after a deer all day until it collapsed from exhaustion. We thrive in a massive range of environments. We handle sleep deprivation better than most animals. Screwed dwarfs. Humans should be the ones with a con. We're the John Mcclane of nature. 8. As individuals, we're unique in our drives, wants and needs. But as a group, we're boring and predictable. 9. The body's ability to heal wounds is fascinatingly overlooked. 10. Humans hold themselves separate from nature. To us, there's nature and then there's humanity. When nature encroaches on humanity, we fight it back. Eleven. We went to the moon not because it was lucrative or to gain something, but purely to say to the other tribe, I'm better than you. 12. We know we are going to die. No other animal carries that weight. 13. Humans can survive a gunshot to the abdomen, but a peanut can kill some of us. 14. We instinctively judge others. It seems to be hardwired into us to stare at someone and form conscious thoughts about them. 15. Our kneecaps are weak as hell. Talk about a design flaw. 16. Imagine life without timekeeping. You probably can't. You know the month, year and day of the week. There's a clock on your wall, dashboard or phone. You live by schedules and calendars. Yet all around us, time keeping is ignored by nature. Birds are not late. Dogs don't check their watches. Deer don't fret over passing birthdays. Man alone measures time. Man alone chimes the hour. And because of this, man alone suffers a paralyzing fear. No other creature endures the fear of time running out.

Your parents are literally the worst part of my job. 2. Yes, I put you in a group with the kids you have a crush on intentionally. I'm stuck here with you 180 days a year. I want to see some drama. 3. Stop wearing your furry tail. Everyone is uncomfortable. 4. I am no longer a teacher, but I remember several days I felt lazy and wanted to give the class the day off. I never did because I knew the teacher's pet would rat me out. Sometimes even the teachers don't like the teacher's pet. Five the weed smell doesn't magically disappear between the parking lot and my classroom. 6. If your parents email a teacher and argue with them, the whole staff knows. 7.

I heard someone say, if you wonder why an actress stopped working, the answer is probably Harvey Weinstein. It's really sad. I see Sopranos fans asking why the actress who played Gloria Trillo didn't do much else. The big answer is that Harvey Weinstein blocked her career from advancing because she turned down his advances. 2, Kevin Spacey. You never see him in anything anymore. I really loved him in house of cards and American Beauty. 3, Taylor Lautner was huge during the Twilight era. He had fans screaming over Team Jacob and seemed set for a major career after that. But when Twilight ended, he started appearing in fewer projects and it's like he faded out as quickly as he shot to fame. Now you barely hear anything about him. And it's wild considering how massive he was for those few years. 4, L m. F. A released party rock anthem, then sorry for party rocking and then vanished off the face of the earth. 5. If you had told me 20 years ago that the most relevant Olsen sister would be Elizabeth, I'd have been very confused. But here we are. The other two are an unentity and she's part of the biggest film franchise of our generation. 6, Wiz Khalifa. I never really listened to him, but black and yellow was on a loop all through high school. After I graduated, I never heard anything about him again. 7, Ellen Degeneres was known for her be kind brand, but then stories emerged about toxic work environments and how poorly people were treated on her show. Former employees and even celebrity guests spoke out. While her show continued for a bit, her reputation was severely damaged. It's crazy how she went from America's beloved talk show host to someone people view as hypocritical. Eight, Chrissy Teigen was known as the Queen of Twitter and was beloved for her witty social media presence. But then past tweets and messages resurfaced showing her bullying behavior and she faced massive backlash. Brands dropped her and she took a long break from social media. Her reputation hasn't fully bounced back and it's wild how fast things turned for her. 9, Louis CK. Was one of the biggest comedians around until allegations of inappropriate behavior came out. He admitted to it, but his career took a major hit with networks and streaming services dropping his shows and projects. He's tried to make a comeback, but it's clear he'll never have the same mainstream acceptance he once did.

One. Not me, but a friend of mine told me about a dream she had years ago about a decrepit old man who was being chased by wolves. In the dream, he kept referring to himself in the third person as old skin. Old skin's gotta get away from the wolves. Eventually the wolves caught up to him and started ripping him to pieces in front of her, and he kept narrating the events in a monotone voice. Old skin's being eaten alive! Old skin's gonna die! She woke up feeling creeped out, but the weirdest part came when she started describing the dream to her brother. He stopped her mid sentence and asked was his name old skin? I had the exact same dream. I don't know if that counts as paranormal, but it's scary. Two. When I was in elementary school, I shared a queen size bed with my older sister and our family dog. A mutt that looked like a short haired Lassie, would sleep at the foot of our bed every night. When I was about six years old, I woke up one night around midnight and saw a dark figure standing at the foot of the bed. The figure was entirely in black, without any eyes or a face. I tried to wake my sister up, but she rolled over to go back to sleep. My sister must have accidentally kicked the dog. Because the dog woke up and raised her head and started growling at the figure at the foot of the bed. The growling then woke my sister up and she saw the figure and started screaming. When my parents came into the room and turned the light on, nothing was there. To this day, both my sister and I are adamant that we saw a ghost or other demon in our room. We know we aren't crazy because the dog saw it too. 3 when I was about 16 years old, I encountered something that still bugs me to this day. I woke up around 6:00am on a normal weekday and went downstairs to get ready to school. No one else in my family had woken up at this point. I got in the shower, still sleepy and could barely hollow my eyes open. After a few minutes of showering, someone tried to get it, and I told whoever it was that I was in the shower. The person then proceeded to aggressively open the door. I saw the door handle going up and down like crazy, and he she whatever knocked on the door harder and harder, and then it suddenly stopped. Didn't think that much about it, but when I got out of the shower, I realized that nobody was up yet. I proceeded with eating breakfast, and after a while, my dad came down the stairs. So l asked him if it was he who had wanted To use the bathroom earlier. He said no, and that both my mom and younger brother was still asleep, so it could have not been them either. And even if it had been any family member, they would not have tried to open the door so aggressively at six in the morning.

So my 4 year old is obsessed with Minecraft. I enjoy it quite a lot also, but I'm really only playing it because he wants to watch. But he keeps wanting me to do creepy things. Like the latest thing he wants me to do is to build tracks and collect all of the villagers into a place and build a machine to kill them. I know they aren't real people or anything, but no, I'm not going to build concentration camps. 2. My teenage daughter claims that our family is a communist dictatorship and she has no rights. I sighed, told her it's more like a fascist dictatorship or maybe even a monarchy. 3. Lying but in a really incompetent way. She's nearly 3 and has started trying to get out of doing stuff by making the most outrageous and clearly untrue statements like you can't brush my hair, I haven't got a head and I can't put my shoes on. I'm a box and boxes don't have feet, etc. I try not to just laugh in her face but it's difficult. 4. My son is wearing pull UPS and if the smell is any indication, he is currently shitting his pants while grunting and telling me right to my face he doesn't have to go poop. This shit is really getting old. 5. I have a 14 year old who Is obsessed with socks. He spent like $19 on a single pair of socks. They have to be these Nike Elite gold plated something. Something I hope he grows out of this fast 6. He won't shave his beard. He's 17 and it's very thin and long. Reminds me of the first time I saw my own armpit hair when I was in middle school. I'm getting married next week. I asked him to shave and he said, but mom, it'll take me like two years to grow it back. So we compromised that he would at least trim it shorter.

If you're passionate about what you do, you won't work a day in your life. Wrong. It's still really hard work even though you enjoy it. And to make matters worse, you might work so hard to the point where you end up hating the thing you love. 2. Tilt your head back during a bloody nose. You don't want to flood your throat with nose blood. 3. You should spend two months wages on an engagement ring as a marketing slogan. 4, that people are good eyewitnesses. We aren't. Our perception of things sucks. We are prone to so many biases that we aren't even aware of. If I grade papers on an empty stomach, I will grade them lower than if I am not hungry. And I will never admit that to be true, even though it is. 5. In medical school, we're taught that common things are common and that when you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras. Meaning that we should always assume the most obvious diagnosis. Medical students almost always jump to the rarest disease when taking multiple choice tests or when they first go out into clinical rotations and see real patients. 6. You don't need to wait 30 minutes before going swimming after eating. This was just invented by public pools to stop people bringing food into the water. 7. Put ice on a burn. Do not do this. It can rip the skin. Do put The burn under cool water immediately. 8, you hold your breath. If you run out of air while scuba diving wrong, your lungs will explode as you'll float upwards with a lung full of air, and you probably will try to surface anyway. And the air inside them expands. The proper procedure is to scream all the way up to make sure your airways are open. 9. Don't trust someone who won't look you in the eyes.

I as an American worked for a British company for almost 39 years. Yes, my salary was higher, but I had to pay for health insurance and they did not. I had to pay for my children to go to college and they did not. I got 2 weeks vacation and they got 6 weeks. If I was a woman, I would have gotten 2 weeks maternity leave and with many employers, there is no paid maternity leave and women in the UK got 6 months at the bare minimum. They got free company cars and I did not. And if I did, I would have had to pay income tax on the value of the car. If changed jobs or was laid off, I lost my retirement benefits and health insurance. Their retirement plans were transportable and their health insurance is not tied to their employment status. Taxes are not much different. And if you consider the difference in tax paid benefits, they come out way ahead. Although, yes, there is higher salaries within the US compared to the UK, what you have to pay out of said higher income really does balance things out. When put into perspective, there is no way a British person would find that it would be better to live in the US than in the UK

One, I had a coworker when I was a manager in a major retailer. We were running a project that required third party hiring. Well, in this team was a group of 7 POC who rode together for work. Whenever I was around, they were hard working and quick to listen. But whenever I was at a different location or off for a few days, I would come back and this manager would brief me on how things went. And every time she would bring up how terrible and rude and lazy this group was. And when I would go out to the floor, they would greet me with things like thank god you're back. We were about to quit. It went on like this until one day I was coming back halfway through shift drive time and the group was leaving clearly pissed off, said they couldn't stand her racist ass anymore. Apparently she accused them of being disrespectful and probably stealing like you people do. They ended up filing a case and reporting her. I was told I was going to have to provide testimony as the only other manager present. Right before I got on the call, she actually said, you know, I'm not racist. I have even dated a darky. I was floored. I held nothing back in the testimony. 2 speaking for people of color but getting pissed at people of color for Speaking for themselves. 3, refer to a black person as clean and groomed as if it's something rare and special. Every time a black person applied for a job at my old job, this old white lady who was involved in interviews would say he was clean and didn't have those dreads or something similar. 4. Describing a particular member of a minority group as one of the good ones. 5. When they say you sound white, so only white people can talk properly.

Literally everything about the country sucks. Absolutely horrendously high taxation rates. 20% VAT, up to 40% income tax, fuel tax, some of the highest in the world. Sugar tax, TV tax, national insurance. I know people paying 40% income tax on £50,000. In America the equivalent taxation is less than 20% and the maximum they would pay in VAT is 7% per purchase. In the US people don't pay sugar tax, TV tax or anywhere near what UK pays in fuel tax. Somehow despite this high taxation, UK has consistent underfunding of literally every public service. Police do not respond to burglaries. I've seen people literally being threatened by knives only for the police to say over the phone sorry, no one is available. People have a heart attack and have to wait four hours for an ambulance with the nearest hospital being a one hour drive. Because they shut the other four down to save money. Energy bills ridiculously high, transportation massively overpriced. The vast majority of the country is a complete and utter dump. Your average town is so grim and gray. Housing, what a joke. Absolutely tiny homes not fit for animals, let alone humans. Being lived in by families of four. Literal trailer homes offer much more space than the average house in England. The streets are so depressing. The whole country resembles a Third World slum. A normal American suburb would be the most upper middle class place. You Could live. Wages are terrible. This is a country where £20,000 is a good salary. People who earn more than £40,000 are considered rich. Then there's the weather. A few weeks a year of clear skies and then it's overcast every single day of the year, usually raining. Traffic is awful. Crime is absolutely out of control because the police and courts are powerless. Mindless vandalism is taken over. My city had a bike rental scheme. It lasted less than one year because the company lost 10% of their bikes to theft or vandalism every month. This is supposed to be one of the nicer cities. People can put other people in hospital or rape a child and any sentence more than three years is considered a miracle. Did I mention how terrible our prisons are due to more underfunding? Teenagers literally run riot. There was a story in our local news about an entire town where groups of 60 teenagers have created a no go zone that even the police will not enter. People are resorting to vigilantism up and down the country. I could go on and on, but I don't think any more words can describe how much I hate this country and how I think it's by far the worst in Europe. Rant over. Just had to get that off my chest.

If you're passionate about what you do, you won't work a day in your life. Wrong. It's still really hard work even though you enjoy it. And to make matters worse, you might work so hard to the point where you end up hating the thing you love. 2. Tilt your head back during a bloody nose. You don't want to flood your throat with nose blood. 3. You should spend two months wages on an engagement ring as a marketing slogan. 4. That people are good eye witnesses. We aren't. Our perception of things sucks. We are prone to so many biases that we aren't even aware of. If I grade papers on an empty stomach, I will grade them lower than if I am not hungry, and I will never admit that to be true even though it is. Five. In medical school we're taught that common things are common, and that when you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras, meaning that we should always assume the most obvious diagnosis. Medical students almost always jump to the rarest disease when taking multiple choice tests or when they first go out into clinical rotations and see real patients. 6. You don't need to wait 30 minutes before going swimming after eating. This was just invented by public pools to stop people bringing food into the water. 7. Put ice on a burn. Do not do this, it can rip the skin. Do Put the burn under cool water immediately. 8. You hold your breath if you run out of air while scuba diving. Wrong. Your lungs will explode as you'll float upwards with a lung full of air, and you probably will try to surface anyway and the air inside them expands. The proper procedure is to scream all the way up to make sure your airways are open. 9. Don't trust someone who won't look you in the eyes. Having social anxiety doesn't make you a bad person, and sociopaths have no problem staring you down.

My mother said, you can't talk like that in my home and stopped mid sentence. I pointed at her and said, yeah, that's right, mom, shut your mouth. 2.

We had this obnoxious sales VP that was on the same flight. She was the snobby entitled type with a full time nanny and giant Mcmansion in the suburbs and she generally treated people who worked for her like servants. She sees him in a first class seat as she is making her way to coach and asks him how he got that seat. As people are getting settled in, she makes her way back up to the first class cabin and asks to speak with a lead flight attendant. She tells him that one of her underlings is sitting in first class and that she needs to switch with him since she's higher on the corporate ladder. The guy can't Believe what he's hearing, but she won't take no for an answer. Finally, he tells her she has to go back to her seat or she will be escorted from the plane. She made a complete joke of herself in front of the whole first class cabin 4. When I was in high school, I worked at a popular warehouse club selling computers on weekends. I was hired by the store manager through a friend's referral. I loved computers, so my job was to stay in the computer department and sell them, nothing else. One shift manager didn't like that and insisted I needed to go fold clothes for half my shift. I told him the store manager instructed me never to leave the technology department, but he insisted. This went on for several weeks. The store manager showed up one weekend when we were both working. He slapped a stack of green bar paper, this was a while ago, onto a shelf and pointed to some highlighted numbers. He looked at the shift manager and said, do you see this? This is our average tech sales when you're on shift. See this number over here? This is our average tech sales when you're not. At this point, it would be more cost effective to simply fire you. What do you think? The guy stammered like a toddler caught bullying another kid. Fortunately, he wasn't fired, but the store manager made it clear that when I was on shift, I Was not to leave the tech department unless I was on break or there was a fire. That shift manager never said another word to me.

The way I naturally grip a broom and sweep causes it to gradually unscrew itself until the brush part falls off. So I have to swap which hand is on top and my entire stance. So my sweeping motion will constantly screw the stick and brush tighter together instead.

My favorite is your spare parts, Bud. 15, may you have the day you deserve? 16, do you have any other symptoms? 17, I was a prosecutor, got a letter from a woman in prison. I joked to a colleague that maybe I could get a date. He shot back, you couldn't get a date in a woman's prison with a fistful of pardons. 18, you know you're the reason why no one likes you. 19, your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberry. 20, is your head Just for decoration. 21. I have neither the time nor the crayons to explain this to you.

One. All I can say is that most women are far more attractive than they give themselves credit for. Two my wife is at her most attractive to me when she is laughing or enjoying herself. When she laughs and genuinely smiles, my heart swells. That is the whole reason I act like a goofball all the damn time. I just want to see her smile and laugh as much as possible. Three being without makeup. The other day I came home and my wife was wearing a sundress and no makeup and it was the most beautiful I can ever remember having seen her. She apologized for not having any makeup on. Four laugh lines are more attractive than Botox face. 5. Mom bod. I work with fashion models for a living. Some people can't fathom that I'm infinitely more attracted to a 40+ year old woman with a big old butt, a belly, and wrinkles around her eyes than I am to a skinny 20 year old with ABS and perfect skin. I'm 49. I like women roughly my own age with a body that makes sense for that age. Why is that so hard to believe? 6. That little fluff where the hip meets the thigh that flares out when they sit down. It's one of my favorite parts. Seven what I don't understand is when women hide or mask their real Laugh. There's nothing more attractive than seeing a beautiful woman completely lose it with laughter. The way she holds her sides, the little snort. It's just too cute. It's sad that some people have made them feel unattractive for expressing themselves. 8. I have yet to see a single person who looked better after doing that buckle fat removal procedure. Chubby cheeks are amazing. Nine. Girls who are insecure about their noses have the best noses. 10. I hang around in groups of guys who are guys. Guys. Not once have I heard a guy complain about cellulite. Like, literally not once. 11. How she looks when she first wakes up. 12 years ago, my husband was hospitalized for abdominal surgery. I dressed up four days in a row to go visit him. On the fifth day, I said, to heck with this and went to the hospital in jeans, chambray shirt, tennis shoes, and a ponytail. When I entered, he said, there you are with a big smile. Nice memory.

One Steven Seagal. It's not really close. He's making low quality action movies that seem to exist mostly to launder money for Russian oligarchs. He's so out of shape that most of his action scenes involve him sitting in a chair and lazily slapping at the bad guys. It's embarrassing to watch. Two. Kanye West I don't know, I've just always found him pathetic. His behavior and statements over the years haven't helped his case. 3. Nicki Minaj lately she seems really desperate and it's hard to watch. She's struggling to maintain her relevance in a way that feels forced and uncomfortable. 4. Matthew Perry he was doing relatively fine staying out of the limelight and living as a friend's legend. Then he published that autobiography and included comments like why is it that Keanu Reeves is alive and River Phoenix is dead? Among other off color remarks. Now a lot of people dislike him and his reputation has taken a serious hit. 5. Corey Feldman he's making a strong case for the top spot with his recent wave of band videos flooding social media. The performances are painfully bad and he acts like he's playing to sold out arenas even though the venues look more like the basements of VFW halls. It's beyond cringe worthy. Six. Madonna. The bad plastic surgery and obsession with much younger boyfriends are so beneath her. She's an icon, but she's making a fool of herself unnecessarily. It's sad to see someone with her legacy behaving like this.

I heard someone say, if you wonder why an actress stopped working, the answer is probably Harvey Weinstein. It's really sad. I see Sopranos fans asking why the actress who played Gloria Trillo didn't do much else. The big answer is that Harvey Weinstein blocked her career from advancing because she turned down his advances. 2, Kevin Spacey. You never see him in anything anymore. I really loved him in house of cards and American Beauty. 3, Taylor Lautner was huge during the Twilight era. He had fans screaming over Team Jacob and seemed set for a major career after that. But when Twilight ended, he started appearing in fewer projects and it's like he faded out as quickly as he shot to fame. Now you barely hear anything about him. And it's wild considering how massive he was for those few years. 4, L m. F. A released party rock anthem, then sorry for party rocking and then vanished off the face of the earth. 5. If you had told me 20 years ago that the most relevant Olsen sister would be Elizabeth, I'd have been very confused. But here we are. The other two are an anity and she's part of the biggest film franchise of our generation. 6, Wiz Khalifa. I never really listened to him, but black and yellow was on a loop all through high school. After I graduated, I never heard anything about him again. 7, Ellen Degeneres was known for her be kind brand, but then stories emerged about toxic work environments and how poorly people were treated on her show. Former employees and even celebrity guests spoke out. While her show continued for a bit, her reputation was severely damaged. It's crazy how she went from America's beloved talk show host to someone people view as hypocritical. Eight, Chrissy Teigen was known as the Queen of Twitter and was beloved for her witty social media presence. But then past tweets and messages resurfaced showing her bullying behavior and she faced massive backlash. Brands dropped her and she took a long break from social media. Her reputation hasn't fully bounced back and it's wild how fast things turned for her. 9, Louis CK. Was one of the biggest comedians around until allegations of inappropriate behavior came out. He admitted to it, but his career took a major hit with networks and streaming services dropping his shows and projects. He's tried to make a comeback, but it's clear he'll never have the same mainstream acceptance he once did.

Your parents are literally the worst part of my job. 2. Yes, I put you in a group with the kids you have a crush on intentionally. I'm stuck here with you 180 days a year. I want to see some drama. 3. Stop wearing your furry tail. Everyone is uncomfortable. 4. I am no longer a teacher, but I remember several days I felt lazy and wanted to give the class the day off. I never did because I knew the teacher's pet would rat me out. Sometimes even the teachers don't like the teacher's pet. Five the weed smell doesn't magically disappear between the parking lot and my classroom. 6. If your parents email a teacher and argue with them, the whole staff knows. 7. We have much better hearing than you assume. We just choose our battles when it comes to inappropriate comments. And sometimes I pretend not to see the thing you did because I found it humorous and talking to you about it would only result in me cracking up. 8. If I know your name by the third day of the school year, that means you're probably an asshole. 9. When you think you're being genius by getting me to talk about random things at the beginning of class instead of teaching, I'm really allowing it to happen because I Don't have enough plan to cover a full class. 10. I'm a bus driver. Sit your butt down. You will die if I crash. 11. My students are the reason I'm second guessing having my own kids. 12. Please stop drooling in the classrooms. That's what the bathrooms are for. 13. It's just as weird for me as it is for you when we bump into each other in public. 14. I don't care that you came to class stoned. Just stop interrupting class. And for God's sake, don't touch any power tools while you're stoned. 15. I knew you were cheating, so I gave you a test with the answers in a different order for the rest of the semester. You clearly weren't bright enough to figure it out. And yes, I am that spiteful. It was easier than reporting the cheating. 16. One day you're going to come across people who are not being paid to tolerate you, and all of a sudden, life is going to become considerably more difficult. 17. I encourage my worst kids as much or more than my favorites because I don't want them back in my class next year. 18. I can smell you. Everyone can. Please, for the love of god, use deodorant.

We survive so well that we can freely complain about survival not being to our liking. 2. The concept of pets. We capture other species not to eat or enslave them, but to be friends with them. 3. We can reflect on the fact that we exist. 4. Sometimes I wonder if other animals think humans are ugly. Like those weird hairless cats. We just have this tuft of hair on top and the rest is naked. While we somehow find each other attractive, I wouldn't be surprised if animals thought look at those weird, almost hairless things walking on two feet. So gross. Five. On Halloween we sometimes dress up like the skeletons inside our own bodies. 6. How easily we lose track of reality. A friend of mine once asked me for the $10 I owed him, only to realize he had dreamt that he'd lend it to me. 7. Humans are insanely tough. A lot of animals go into shock and die from injuries humans routinely bounce back from. Many of the flavors we enjoy come from poisons we're immune to. Humans are better at hot weather and long distance running than any other animal. An ancient hunting method involved jogging after a deer all day until it collapsed from exhaustion. We thrive in a massive range of environments. We handle sleep deprivation better than most animals. Screwed dwarfs. Humans should be the ones with a con. We're the John Mcclane of nature. 8. As individuals, we're unique in our drives, wants and needs. But as a group, we're boring and predictable. 9. The body's ability to heal wounds is fascinatingly overlooked. 10. Humans hold themselves separate from nature. To us, there's nature and then there's humanity. When nature encroaches on humanity, we fight it back. Eleven. We went to the moon not because it was lucrative or to gain something, but purely to say to the other tribe, I'm better than you. 12. We know we are going to die. No other animal carries that weight. 13. Humans can survive a gunshot to the abdomen, but a peanut can kill some of us. 14. We instinctively judge others. It seems to be hardwired into us to stare at someone and form conscious thoughts about them. 15. Our kneecaps are weak as hell. Talk about a design flaw. 16. Imagine life without timekeeping. You probably can't. You know the month, year and day of the week. There's a clock on your wall, dashboard or phone. You live by schedules and calendars. Yet all around us, time keeping is ignored by nature. Birds are not late. Dogs don't check their watches. Deer don't fret over passing birthdays. Man alone measures time. Man alone chimes the hour. And because of this, man alone suffers a paralyzing fear. No other creature endures the fear of time running out.

Sea cucumber. The texture is gross, the aftertaste is gross, and the appearance looks like a hippo slimy dung after consuming a field of algae. One pound is more expensive than grade 5 Wagyu.

Props to people who can, but not me. Seven crumbl cookies. Nothing about those things is enjoyable on any physical level. They make you feel horrible. 8. Feastables nine cakes with fondant.

And I'm convinced that the 4 billion or so people who love their food 10 star Spicy Hot are simply engaged in an elaborate conspiracy to troll me personally. 11.

I'm gonna go in a different direction on this, but I'm gonna say the Mcrib. 13. Twizzlers fruit flavored window sealant 14. Shark fin soup. Shark fin is essentially flavorless. 15.

Any of those American monstrosities where they pack a ton of chocolates and candies into one big cake or whatever it is. When you put all those amazing sweets into one glob, you don't really get to enjoy their good parts. It's just a mess of sugar with some hints of flavor.

My friend got his hearing at age 6. He swears to this day that he thought flowers would make some sort of noise and that's what attracted bees. 2. My cousin was born deaf and underwent an operation to recover part of his hearing when he was twelve. He sometimes uses hearing aids, but can get by without them. His family had a bunny. Of course, he had Learned about cows mooing, cats meowing, etc. Before his surgery. He was very shocked when he came home and greeted his bunny to find that it made no sound. It took him the longest time to understand that bunnies are pretty quiet animals in general. He explained that he thought all pets were loud. Three. My dad's lifelong best friend was born with hearing but lost it before age 2 due to health issues. He went his entire childhood deaf, and in his 20s finally got a hearing aid. At the time, he and his wife were living downtown in a large city. Apparently he had the hearing aid for about two weeks before he threw it out, saying everything was too loud. He hated the noise and sound, saying things were more peaceful without it. Fifteen years later, he moved out into the country on a few hundred acres of woods. Still, he refused to wear a hearing aid and kept Refusing for the next 10 years, finally, his wife convinced him to give it a try, and his mind was blown. He couldn't believe how quiet everything was and how much he enjoyed hearing. He explained that he had thought the noise of the traffic downtown was the wind, and that it sounded like that everywhere, all the time. So for 25 years, he thought wind sounded like the hundreds of cars driving by. 4 my three year old son is deaf, and we just had a visit this morning from his signing teacher, who is also deaf herself. She recently had cochlear implants fitted. While we were talking and signing, she said, I'm sorry, I can't concentrate. I can hear a horrible constant noise. It hasn't stopped the whole time I've been here. It turned out it was the rain on my conservatory roof. 5 I had a childhood friend who gained hearing and didn't realize you could control the volume of your voice. When I whispered to her, she said, hang on, I think I need to adjust my hearing aid. At first I just thought, oh, it must not be working. Until I realized what was going on. She whispered to me for about two weeks straight just to practice.

I experienced something called exploding head syndrome, which is much less severe than the name might imply. Basically, sometimes right as I'm on the edge of sleep, I'll hear a loud auditory hallucination that jolts me back awake. Pretty rare though. It only happens to me maybe once a month. Five. When I blow my nose, my left eye bubbles from the corner like air is coming through. Freaks me out every time because it feels so weird. 6. I used to have a hedgehog named Velcro. I'd let him run around on my bed. One morning I slid out of bed and got a sharp pain in my left ass cheek. I walked to the bathroom and saw that I had a half inch quill lodged firmly in my haunch. I pulled out what I could and thought I got it all. It wept a few times and Eventually healed. It's been 20 years, and I still have a scab on my ass that falls off once a month and comes back in a few days. I can feel there's something deep under the skin, but because of the bad angle, there's no way I can take care of it without a dermatologist's help. 7. The texture of the skin on my right palm changed after I was sick back in March. Sometimes it's bubbly and really itchy, sometimes it looks tight and glossy, and sometimes it's so dry that the skin cracks. I can definitely see a difference between the right and the left ones. The little lines on my right palm aren't as visible anymore. Eight. I have a singular white eyelash on one of my eyes that grows really quickly and gets so long that it pokes into my actual eye, and I need to cut it every couple of months to keep it short.

If I'm like hey, I saw our mutual friend while running errands, let Me know what you want for dinner? I'm about to go pick it up. And did you take out the trash? Get a response that says, oh yeah, Dave. Haven't seen him in a while. 7 he uses my expensive shampoo to wash his whole body when there is a bar of soap right there. 8 my wife says she never understood how my friend walks into the apartment and go straight to the kitchen and grab stuff to eat drink like it's his own home on top of it.

One so my four year old is obsessed with Minecraft. I enjoy it quite a lot also, but I'm really only playing it because he wants to watch. But he keeps wanting me to do creepy things. Like the latest thing he wants me to do is to build tracks and collect all of the villagers into a place and build a machine to kill them. I know they aren't real people or anything, but no, I'm not going to build concentration camps. Two. My teenage daughter claims that our family is a communist dictatorship and she has no rights. I sighed, told her it's more like a fascist dictatorship or maybe even a monarchy. 3. Lying, but in a really incompetent way. She's nearly three and has started trying to get out of doing stuff by making the most outrageous and clearly untrue statements like you can't brush my hair, I haven't got a head and I can't put my shoes on, I'm a box and boxes don't have feet, etc. I try not to just laugh in her face, but it's difficult. Four. My son is wearing pull UPS and if the smell is any indication, he is currently shitting his pants while grunting and telling me right to my face he doesn't have to go poop. This shit is really getting old. 5. I have a 14 year old who Is obsessed with socks. He spent, like, $19 on a single pair of socks. They have to be these Nike Elite Gold plated. Something, something. I hope he grows out of this fast. Six. He won't shave his beard. He's 17, and it's very thin and long. Reminds me of the first time I saw my own armpit hair when I was in middle school. I'm getting married next week. I asked him to shave, and he said, but, mom, it'll take me, like, two years to grow it back. So we compromised that he would at least trim it shorter.

One, I had a coworker when I was a manager in a major retailer. We were running a project that required third party hiring. Well, in this team was a group of 7 POC who rode together for work. Whenever I was around, they were hard working and quick to listen. But whenever I was at a different location or off for a few days, I would come back and this manager would brief me on how things went. And every time she would bring up how terrible and rude and lazy this group was. And when I would go out to the floor, they would greet me with things like thank god you're back. We were about to quit. It went on like this until one day I was coming back halfway through shift drive time and the group was leaving clearly pissed off, said they couldn't stand her racist ass anymore. Apparently she accused them of being disrespectful and probably stealing like you people do. They ended up filing a case and reporting her. I was told I was going to have to provide testimony as the only other manager present. Right before I got on the call, she actually said, you know, I'm not racist. I have even dated a darky. I was floored. I held nothing back in the testimony. 2 speaking for people of color but getting pissed at people of color for Speaking for themselves. 3, refer to a black person as clean and groomed as if it's something rare and special. Every time a black person applied for a job at my old job, this old white lady who was involved in interviews would say he was clean and didn't have those dreads or something similar. 4. Describing a particular member of a minority group as one of the good ones. 5. When they say you sound white, so only white people can talk properly.

I once had a pre kindergartener who could read and cried because he was so upset with how dumb the rest of the kids were. 2. I had a student ask for an extension on their paper because they were representing our nation in the World Science Festival. They came in third and the paper was an a plus. 3 had a first grader figure out exponents on his own. 4 kid took the fat highlighters, cut them open and remove the insides and replaced it with weed, sold them at school. He was caught but only because a kid snitched after they were caught getting high. Absolutely brilliant. 5. One of my kindergarteners just knows multiplication and not just the basic fives or tens. In the beginning when his parents told me I played along with 2, 2 or 10 x 10 but you can tell him 17 x 14 and he knows it instantly. So cool to watch. 6. I had a kid who could take one look at a national flag and then point to the corresponding country on an unlabeled world map instantly. I think that kid spent too many hours playing grand strategy games. 7. I'm a piano teacher on the side teaching a 4 year old how to read sheet music before she can read books. I ask her to find the C's and she will point them out. On the page, ECT. She can also do math really well and understands the concept of multiplication. Also another student that just started and plays by ear and composes her own pieces at 8. She also speaks five languages, which I didn't find out until I told her I was learning German. After teaching her for three months, she's already to the point where I had to send her to a better teacher.

A bee sting to the cock can enlarge it permanently. Shout out to the person who discovered it. 2. Michael Jackson's hair caught on fire at the exact median day of his life. He had a literal midlife crisis. 3. If provided with a mirror, dolphins will admire their own genitals. 4. Being steamed alive allows the victim to feel nearly everything because your nerves don't get destroyed as fast as being burned alive, and it's healthier because it preserves the nutrients. 5. Being skinned alive doesn't kill nearly as quickly as you'd think. When done carefully, the victim may not die of blood loss or shock, but rather hypothermia. Some account record that people have survived for several days. 6. If you spill bleach on your skin, the slippery feeling you feel when you wash it off is because you have basically made soap by dissolving the top layer of skin. 7. There is a chemical called MPTP that specifically destroys dopaminergic neurons in the brain. About three days after someone ingests it, they get Parkinson's disease. Eight. Suicide bombers can be easily identified after blowing themselves up, since the pressure from the explosion fractures the neck and sends the head flying away to safety from the explosion. 9. In 1985, a Serbian farmer stuck a beer bottle up his ass broadside first. This sparked a chain of events that eventually LED to The collapse of Yugoslavia. 10. When you are starving and have little body fat left, your body can grow almost fur like hair to insulate itself in absence of fat. 11. Cuttlefish mating is fascinating. The females all hunker down while the big males fight each other for a chance to copulate. While the big tough males are duking it out, small males will kind of pull in their tentacles to look like females, sneak past the fighting males, and mate with the females. Interestingly, female cuttlefish have some control over which sperm makes it to the eggs, and overwhelmingly choose the cutting small male sperm over the big brawny males who come into mate after finishing fighting. Brains over Brawn. 12. Locked in syndrome is a scary condition where you are conscious while in a coma. 13. Octopuses are usually very antisocial, but when they're under the influence of ecstasy, they are more willing to spend time around each other or even hug other octopuses.

And if mommy leaves you for another dad, I will always tell the new dad that my old dad was my favorite dad. Thanks, I love you. Where's your mom? Four me tell me a joke.

Kid comes around the corner in cart pushed by mom and exclaims, Mommy, those guys are fat! Mom looks us over and nods in approval. No fucks given. 8 are you having a baby or just fat? I'm male. 9 why do you have little Volcanoes on your face! Fuck you, you little fuck! 10 daddy, why do you have so many wives? My three year old Disney princess movie obsessed daughter said to me I was a single 20 years old dad with full custody. So naturally, she saw me go through a few different girlfriends. That was the moment I decided things were gonna change.

You go through the self checkout at a shop and see yourself on the camera screen. 3. A little kid will tell you they are honest and blunt and don't even know it. 4. If you make a self deprecating joke about your looks and everyone gets really uncomfortable instead of laughing or complimenting you. 5. When you occasionally look in a mirror and go oh for fuck sake. A good sign is when you're hanging out with a hot friend and they get 90% of the attention from strangers. You know they're not wanting to talk to you. 6. I wish I could find a guy like you. You're so sweet. 7. One time I was walking to my desk to get something and a girl was by it talking to one of her friends. She looked at me and said Ew with a face of disgust and looked away from me. That killed me a little on the inside. Eight. I'm a girl and I dressed up as Marilyn Monroe for Halloween One year in college. Went to a party. Throughout the night, three different guys accused me of being a man in drag. Feels bad, man. 9. It's always a letdown when people say you look like a celebrity. Stephen Hawking is my most Frequent match Ken. I once had a group therapy session where we stood in a circle and had to say something we liked about the appearance of one another. I don't remember what the point of that was, it was too long ago. Sorry. Anyway, everyone received their compliments beautiful hair, great smile, etc. Until it was my turn to get complimented. They all went silent for a good while until one of them said something along the lines of you are kind of funny sometimes. After that, the therapist just told them to skip to the next person while giving me a sympathetic look. That shit still haunts me.

White Chapel was perfectly creepy. Absolutely criminal it got banned as a young child. The original broadcast of Ghostwatch 1992 was a total mind fuck. Garth Marenghi's dark place. MI8, which is actually three levels above MI5, pulled the plug because they knew the truth. Jim will fix it. Which isn't even a joke. Even as a kid, knowing nothing of what Saville got up to, I found myself wondering why the deeply strange and off putting man had a Saturday night prime time TV show. Children of the stone shit me up as a kid. Crimewatch with the famous don't have nightmares, do sleep well ending. Hammer House of horror and The Tales of the unexpected were both series which would scare the crap out of me. The Tomorrow People and Hammer House of Horror Tales of the unexpected. Only decent thing I watched on Channel 5 was a horror anthology called Urban Gothic. Was on at 11 30 PM on a Monday so didn't get a lot of views but had some solid episodes for horror fans. The boy from space creeped me the f out when I was young. Still haven't quite got over it. Just look at the screen grabs on IMDB.

Traditional British food is great. The whole world shits on it, but it's comforting, filling and delicious. Our weather is bloody brilliant. You all litter like crazy. The amount of litter is astonishing to many of us immigrants. Wetherspoons has had a greater positive contribution to the country over the past 25 years than maybe any other private company. We are a spineless country. We often mock the French, but they actually scare their politicians. Keep calm and carry on is a dangerous phrase that the British use as a positive. What it really means is suck it up and don't expect better. Sunday roasts are overpriced, overcooked, under seasoned puddings. Menu items, on the other hand, are absolutely smashing. Some British people have a strain of subservience bred into them, willing to accept any authority over them. We are following the Americans down the same road where veterans are worshipped and everyone must constantly thank them or use them in an argument such as why are we helping X when we could be helping our veterans. That Brits are nostalgic for their empire. I literally have never heard anyone who is alive now say this. It feels like a retired colonel from Tunbridge Wells view of the 70s and has long disappeared from most British people's mindset. Not every event has to involve alcohol and lots of us need to stop being judgmental pricks.

One. She changed her clothes in front of me while casually talking. Two. I was 17 and was best friends with a college girl in town. We were chilling late one night and we wrapped up a movie and was getting her stuff together since she had work in the morning. She stopped me and said, what if I just stay? The way she looked at me when she said that, it sealed my fate forever. I married that woman and we now have two beautiful little kids. Three. She nuzzled into my neck during a hug. We hadn't seen each other in a while, so it was definitely an interesting surprise. 4. I had a personal trainer friend brag about her braided ponytail and then had me give it a sharp tug while we were at work. We both immediately understood that could not happen at work again. Five. Told me he really likes my body, then got flustered trying to rephrase. He meant my tattoos. I had a new one on my arm. I think he blushed a little. Six. I had a really good friend in grad school. We would talk, ride motorcycles, go to local fairs, hang out, and just generally have fun. She was very pretty, but I never thought of her in a romantic way. She was taking belly dancing lessons and decided to give me a quick sample while we were at the Library. I was instantly turned on and couldn't think of her in any other way after that. 7. She was dressed as a police officer for a Halloween party and I jokingly suggested she handcuffed me. Learned new things about myself that night. 8. I was crossing the road with a former classmate in college and as we were about to go, a car sped up suddenly and he put his hand in front of me to protect me from going. I didn't find him attractive or anything, but that was, surprisingly to me, a huge turn on that came out of nowhere. 9. She came over to our friend's house and was wearing a zip up hoodie. She went up to me and gave me a hug, then told me she wasn't wearing anything underneath and unzipped it a little. Ten. She took my hat. I chased and caught her and pinned her up against the wall to get the hat back. When I pinned her hands above her head to get the hat, she bit her lip and she gave me a look. When she gave me that look, I also instantly felt what she was feeling. 11. She fed me popcorn one by one. 12. I knew this girl who was hands down the prettiest I've ever seen. No makeup, with her hair pulled back. She smiled at me while trying my glasses on. I had to turn away due to my body's reaction. We were outside So I was able to act naturally. 13, she was the girl next door. We would chat, but nothing else. Until one day, she kissed me. 48 years later, she's still kissing me.

I'll lay down completely unmoving, legs and arms spread. He'll go, is that a cozy spot? No matter what he's doing, he'll come over and lay on top of me, pretending not to realize it's me. Then I'll trap him in my legs and arms. We call it the Venus Fly trap. 3, when my wife starts talking about weird stuff or starts fantasizing about what might happen in an utterly impossible hypothetical situation, I start making whale sounds. 4, he's my towel boy. Whenever I'm done with my shower, I call out towel boy. He'll drop everything and come running just to hand me my towel. Sometimes he'll leave an ad and here's your towel, ma'am, please. I need this job. I've got a wife and kids to support. My towel is only ever a couple of feet from the shower, but he insists on handing to me every time if I'm impatient and fetch my own towel. Oh, no, please, ma'am, I really need this job, etc. Etc. I love this bit and look forward to it every day. 5, we'll go to hold hands, but then turn it into a handshake, like a business deal, then laugh maniacally and say, you have no idea what You just agreed to. 6, homing Beacon. We live in a crowded city and when we lose track of each other in stores and in the streets, we have a specific noise we make until we find each other. People look at us like we're nuts. Whenever his work shirts get old and need to be thrown out, he puts them on and we wrestle and I tear the shirt to pieces. This started after a cosplay costume arrived for him that was way too small and he put it on to try and tear it like he was the Hulk but couldn't so I helped. We also rescue pigeons. 7. I used to put googly eyes on my then girlfriend while she slept and wait for her to find them the next day and see if I could be so strategic that she'd go the whole day at work and not find some. I succeeded. One night I put a bigger one on her forehead after she dozed off, half used and would come off very easily so the glue and suction wouldn't have left a Mark and went to brush my teeth. Few minutes later she came in, looks in the mirror, stares and very groggy and dryly said, why is there a googly eye on my head? I laughed for a good several minutes straight. 8. Our stuffed animals have voices and personalities and very complex interpersonal relationships. For example, Manny the Manny is always up to Something illegal. 9, we do this thing where I say something and then she tells me I'm wrong.

Sleep. Every morning I asked my wife how she slept and it's the same reply. I didn't sleep at all. Poor girl hasn't slept in 30 years. 2. I used to think girls cried ink. Turns out it was just mascara. Three, wash their bras after every time they wear it. Buy a lot of clothes. In reality, they just walk around in stores, touch clothes and say, oh, this is cute. Brush their hair 100 times a night. 6. As a kid I thought that girls thought that swords, Shields and armor were stupid. Turns out that there are plenty of women who love swords and metal work and stuff like that. 7. I thought women would wear more skirts or high heels than they do in reality, which is 100% understandable. Why not be comfortable or dress however the hell you want? Only I feel like skirts and heels are just a bit overrepresented in media. Just like how you'll see way more men in suits on television or in movies than you generally will on the average street day to day. 8. That every woman liked other women and they were only with a man because, well, I don't know. 9, powder their nose. Turns out it's mostly just in movies. 10. I have been with my wife for 15 years and I have never heard her fart. Not one time. 11, until I Was about 10 ish. I thought all girls were vegetarian and all boys were meat eaters. 12. Growing up, my mother and many of the women in my family were legitimately gold diggers. It took me way too long to realize that not all women base their entire view of men off of their salary. 13. Apparently some women just straight up buy clothes without trying them on first. 14. Due to past experiences, I truly believe that given the opportunity, all women would cheat. Thanks to some amazing daughters in law, I've seen the error of my thinking and realize that I just have terrible taste in women.

On the last day of school, one of the well liked class clown types played a fake seizure prank in a certain teacher's class. He didn't realize she'd had a student literally pass away in her arms the previous year and she had a panic attack thinking it was happening again. The people who knew about her history quickly spread the word and everyone gave him a really hard time for it. He denies it happened to this day, but I was in the room when it happened. I remember being afraid for him, then growing annoyed and silently angry when he started laughing while she began to cry. 2. We graduated and he found out that nobody cares that you were a star linebacker after high school. 3, there was this big fight between him and this other kid who was a pretty big jerk. Everyone knew it was coming and there was a decent sized crowd. Everyone was rooting for him. He ended up really beating the guy pretty badly, which I think shocked most of the kids. Fights at school usually got broken up pretty quickly, but this was after school, off site, so there was no authority figure there to stop it. Then he smashed the kids car windows with a tire iron before whipping it out and urinating on the kid who was still unconscious. This was before camera phones, but someone brought a digital camcorder and The video wound up on a couple websites. Everyone in school wound up seeing it and no one really looked at that kid the same way again. 4, we didn't see him much after he knocked up his girlfriend and had to drop out of seventh grade. I'm not joking. They were both seventh grader preteens. They kept the baby and their families made him drop out and get a job to support it. This was in the US in the 90s, and it's super sad. Five, to quote a close friend of mine, he was cool when he was 13 and then he never changed. Six, let this be a lesson to parents. Listen to your kids when they say they're sick. Back in 7th grade, there was this kid. Let's call him Greg. He wasn't super popular, but he had lots of friends and got along with everyone. One day during lunch, Greg's friend group tried to sit at our table, but there wasn't enough room. When we asked why they didn't just sit at their usual spot, one of them pointed at Greg, who was sitting all alone, and said, Greg went No. 2 on himself in class and smells really bad. The poor kid just sat there staring at a wall the entire lunch period. I'll never forget that face either. He was just completely void of all emotion. It was so sad to look at. I've never seen anyone look so hollow. Later we found Out. Greg had a stomach bug, but since he didn't have a fever, his mom sent him to school anyway. During class, he had the accident and it was so loud it was impossible to ignore. He ran to the bathroom leaving a trail behind. The worst part of it all, though, was that it happened early in the morning and his mother came to deliver him a change of pants but didn't pick him up or anything. The poor kid had to sit through the rest of the school day. I look back on that and still think about how crazy it was that within a day he lost every one of his friends and his entire social life was ruined. For the next 5 years, even in high school, he was known as the kid who had that accident in 7th grade.

My friend got his hearing at age 6. He swears to this day that he thought flowers would make some sort of noise, and that's what attracted bees. 2, my cousin was born deaf and underwent an operation to recover part of his hearing when he was 12. He sometimes uses hearing aids, but can get by without them. His family had a bunny. Of course, he had Learned about cows mooing, cats meowing, etc. Before his surgery. He was very shocked when he came home and greeted his bunny to find that it made no sound. It took him the longest time to understand that bunnies are pretty quiet animals in general. He explained that he thought all pets were loud. Three, my dad's lifelong best friend was born with hearing but lost it before age 2 due to health issues. He went his entire childhood deaf and in his 20s finally got a hearing aid. At the time, he and his wife were living downtown in a large city. Apparently, he had the hearing aid for about two weeks before he threw it out, saying everything was too loud. He hated the noise and sound, saying things were more peaceful without it. Fifteen years later, he moved out into the country on a few hundred acres of woods. Still, he refused to wear a hearing aid and kept Refusing for the next 10 years. Finally his wife convinced him to give it a try and his mind was blown. He couldn't believe how quiet everything was and how much he enjoyed hearing. He explained that he had thought the noise of the traffic downtown was the wind and that it sounded like that everywhere all the time. So for 25 years he thought wind sounded like the hundreds of cars driving by. 4. My three year old son is deaf and we just had a visit this morning from his signing teacher who is also deaf herself. She recently had cochlear implants fitted. While we were talking and signing, she said, I'm sorry, I can't concentrate. I can hear a horrible constant noise. It hasn't stopped the whole time I've been here. It turned out it was the rain on my conservatory roof. 5. I had a childhood friend who gained hearing and didn't realize you could control the volume of your voice. When I whispered to her, she said, hang on, I think I need to adjust my hearing aid. At first I just thought, oh, it must not be working until I realized what was going on. She whispered to me for about two weeks straight just to practice.

As a UPS driver, a customer once asked what's in the package? I was stunned by the stupidity and replied, no idea you ordered it. 2. While shopping at Costco, I was looking at the salmon when another customer came up, looked at the salmon, and asked, where is this from? I sarcastically said, space. He said thank you and walked away. Three. At a gas station, a customer asked, hey, the bathroom door is locked, can I get a key? I replied, there's no key. If it's locked, someone's in there. They asked, how does it know? I said, how does what know? They clarified, how does the bathroom know someone is in there? I had to explain, people. People go in and then they lock the door. Four. I work at a hotel. A client once asked if I book a room, does it include the bed? I replied, no sir, we only provide a chair so you can sit and wait until checkout time. 5. While at a drive through, the person in front of me asked if they could have their food to go. 6. I worked on a Christmas tree farm over winter break in college. A lady once asked, so what are these trees made out of? 7. A guy on the phone said, yes, I understand. I haven't paid my credit card Bill in three months, but why can't I use My card. I replied, because you haven't paid your Bill in three months. 8 I ran a lawn mowing service. A new customer asked, do you come to my house to mow it? I said, no, we pick it up and haul it to our special mowing center, then bring it back. 9 back when I did tech support, I received a call from a customer with a peculiar keyboard problem. He said, I'm having trouble with a shift key. When I type a letter with a shift key, it gives me the uppercase letter, but when I type a number, it doesn't give me the uppercase number. I had to break it to him gently. 10 while working at a call center asking people to pay their old bills, I had this exchange. Customer so this is what you do all day? Just call people who haven't paid their bills? Me yes. Customer so if I paid my bills, you'd be out of a job? Me if everybody paid their bills, then yes. Customer haha, good. You just messed up by telling me this. I'm going to pay my bills right away. When you're unemployed, then see how you like getting calls about your bills.

One we were bringing lunch to the teachers at school and my daughter announced, we made a special soup for Mr. S because he's a virgin. Mr. S is a vegan. Two. My partner's five year old daughter was watching me do my makeup in the mirror and she said, you look like an angel. That's the sweetest thing she's ever said to me. So I gushed like a teenage girl and thanked her with a big grin on my face. Then she elaborated, you look like you're dead. Three. My niece said, Uncle Sam drank and drove us home. It was a Coca Cola, you little narc. 4. A three year old girl on an airplane loudly announced, my daddy left me and Mommy and I don't know where he went. Then she pointed to her mom's tummy and added, there's a baby in there too. The mom had to quickly remind her to tell the rest of the story that daddy had taken another plane to a different city for work, but would be meeting up with them in a few days on their family vacation. Five. My seven year old son slept on the top bunk of a bed with his brother below. He's a bit of a tank and was hitting around 28 kg. One night he asked me to put him to bed and I said, mate, you're getting really heavy. I'm not sure I Can lift you all the way up that high anymore. He looked me straight in the eye and said, dad, you just need to believe in yourself. 6 my niece was three when my nephew was born. She came up to me and my girlfriend when we were visiting my sister in the hospital and asked, so am I not allowed to punch the baby in the head? Seven me how old do you think Grandpa is? Five year old. Nephew uh, 12. Me no, he's actually 62. Nephew oh shit, he's going to die soon. 8 I once heard my son, who had just watched the original Star Wars series, ask my grandfather, who is a British World War 2 vet, what side did you fight on in the war? My grandfather responded, with the Empire. My kid cried for days because he thought his great grandfather fought for the Galactic Empire. 9 this happened last week when Kid 0 2 was born. I brought Kid 0, No. 1, who had just turned 5, to the hospital for the first time to meet his new brother. He takes one look at the sleeping baby and says, he's so cute. Then he turns to my wife, looks her in the eye, and asks with genuine concern, how's your vagina? The nurses lost it.

One, sometimes I'll have one random hair that grows out of my arm that has the consistency of plastic and is almost clear. My mom gets it too. It's just one hair. Two, my left leg makes cracking sounds when I walk upstairs. I'm only 20 years old. 3. There's an indent on my right foot where a horse stepped on it. I never went to a doctor about it and I assume it was broken, but it's been almost 20 years. 4, I experienced something called exploding head syndrome, which is much less severe than the name might imply. Basically, sometimes right as I'm on the edge of sleep, I'll hear a loud auditory hallucination that jolts me back awake. Pretty rare, though. It only happens to me maybe once a month. 5, when I blow my nose, my left eye bubbles from the corner like air is coming through. Freaks me out every time because it feels so weird. 6. I used to have a hedgehog named Velcro. I'd let him run around on my bed. One morning I slid out of bed and got a sharp pain in my left ass cheek. I walked to the bathroom and saw that I had a half inch quill lodged firmly in my haunch. I pulled out what I could and thought I got it all. It wept a few times and Eventually healed. It's been 20 years, and I still have a scab on my ass that falls off once a month and comes back in a few days. I can feel there's something deep under the skin, but because of the bad angle, there's no way I can take care of it without a dermatologist's help. 7. The texture of the skin on my right palm changed after I was sick back in March. Sometimes it's bubbly and really itchy. Sometimes it looks tight and glossy, and sometimes it's so dry that the skin cracks. I can definitely see a difference between the right and the left ones.

One. Sometimes I'll have one random hair that grows out of my arm that has the consistency of plastic and is almost clear. My mom gets it too. It's just one hair. Two. My left leg makes cracking sounds when I walk upstairs. I'm only 20 years old. 3. There's an indent on my right foot where a horse stepped on it. I never went to a doctor about it and I assume it was broken, but it's been almost 20 years. 4. I experienced something called exploding head syndrome, which is much less severe than the name might imply. Basically, sometimes right as I'm on the edge of sleep, I'll hear a loud auditory hallucination that jolts me back awake. Pretty rare though. It only happens to me maybe once a month. Five. When I blow my nose, my left eye bubbles from the corner like air is coming through. Freaks me out every time because it feels so weird. 6. I used to have a hedgehog named Velcro. I'd let him run around on my bed. One morning I slid out of bed and got a sharp pain in my left ass cheek. I walked to the bathroom and saw that I had a half inch quill lodged firmly in my haunch. I pulled out what I could and thought I got it all. It wept a few times and Eventually healed. It's been 20 years, and I still have a scab on my ass that falls off once a month and comes back in a few days. I can feel there's something deep under the skin, but because of the bad angle, there's no way I can take care of it without a dermatologist's help. 7. The texture of the skin on my right palm changed after I was sick back in March. Sometimes it's bubbly and really itchy, sometimes it looks tight and glossy, and sometimes it's so dry that the skin cracks. I can definitely see a difference between the right and the left ones. The little lines on my right palm aren't as visible anymore. Eight. I have a singular white eyelash on one of my eyes that grows really quickly and gets so long that it pokes into my actual eye, and I need to cut it every couple of months to keep it short.

One. When cake mixes first came out, you only had to add water to them. However, many housewives felt like this was cheating and wouldn't buy the mixes, so cake mix companies added an extra step. The eggs. It worked! Apparently the act of cracking and adding eggs to the batter was enough to make it feel more homemade, and cake mixes became extremely popular. Two. That minty, fresh, zesty, clean feeling you get from toothpaste started as a marketing strategy. It caught on, and now almost all toothpaste is mint flavored because we associate the mint freshness with cleanliness. Three. Airport security Homeland Security zone inspectors were able to get illegal items through TSA checkpoint 70% of the time. The increased security measures give travelers a sense of safety, but they may not be as effective as we think. 4. As an IT person, I've noticed that giving a user a new monitor will make them swear that their computer is faster. 5. The exaggerated sounds of some vacuum cleaners, microwaves, and cars are designed to make them sound more powerful. Similarly, the loading screens on some apps are created to make it seem like they are performing complex tasks, even if they AREN'T. Six. The original Febreeze was unscented, but people didn't believe it worked, so the company added a scent to it and suddenly people felt it was more effective. 7. Beats headphones have weights inside Them to make them heavier, giving the illusion of quality and sturdiness. 8. Have you ever noticed how long it takes a coin star machine to process and count coins and return a receipt? It actually finishes counting very quickly, but people were skeptical of its accuracy, so a fake delay with artificial counting noises was added to give users more confidence in the results. Nine loading spinners on web pages. I once had a user complain that a web app was too slow even though it was performing well. To test him, I made the animation spinner spin faster. He later praised me to my boss, saying that the web app was now much faster. 10. Car doors are designed to close loudly, even though they could be made to close quietly. The loud thunk sound gives people a sense of safety and sturdiness. 11. My dog's medicine becomes mysteriously treat like when it comes out of his treat tin instead of the medicine packaging. Seconds ago it was a disgusting medicine, but the placebo effect from the treat tin changes his perception. 12. The idea that free shipping is a better deal. In most cases, the cost of shipping has already been added to the product price. However, people feel like they've gotten a better deal when they see free shipping.

Since my hands were full, I'd use one of her outstretched paws to turn on lights whenever we entered a room. Now the little rascal switches them on and off for fun. 2, our cat had impacted anal glands. For a while, we had to bribe him with treats to let us check on him. Now, whenever he wants a treat, he comes up and sticks his butt in our faces. 3, my niece loves facetiming my mom to talk to her dog. When the dog was a puppy, my mom would pull her onto her lap when she Facetimed. Now the dog is 80 pounds and will jump in your lap whenever your phone or tablet starts making the Facetime ringtone. 4, I used to pick my kitten up to kill spiders for me that were up high. Now whenever I pick her up, she looks up at the ceiling and starts searching for spiders. 5. My dog knew he'd always get ice to chew whenever I went to the fridge. So anytime he heard the ice machine start, he'd come running. Once he became deaf, he'd feel the vibrations in the floor and knew it was ice time. 6. I take baths with my cat by letting her float in a plastic box. I keep the box in my closet. I only started doing this. About a month ago, but now whenever I turn the bath water on, she runs to the closet and jumps in her box. 7. I would playfully grab my dog's snout when we were playing. He somehow figured out it's my favorite thing to do whenever he comes over. Now, every time he senses that I'm upset or sees that I'm crying, he'll come up and gently put his snout in my hand. 8. After my roommate got a cat, my dog started answering to Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, because he wants love and treats just like the cat. Nine, somewhere along the way, my dog Learned that get your toy means to pick up the nearest toy. I didn't train him to do it, but it comes in handy when I want him to bring a toy inside. If no toy is around, he'll grab the nearest soft thing, usually some piece of clothing. One time he even tried to pick up the cat.

My husband was friends with a guy for years and didn't know how old he was. 2. Scrolls through channels on TV, sees movie, does not know when it started, has zero context about the plot, watches the rest of the movie anyway. 3. Why are guys so apprehensive about receiving gifts? Buddy, I found a cool pair of socks that looks like a shark is eating your foot and I paid next to nothing for it. Why do you have to act like you now have to pay for my college tuition? Can I not just gift guys things for fun? 4, how they make friends with everyone. Seriously, I was at work and saw two guys getting a massive screaming match, almost fighting. I grabbed security and when we go to check it, the two guys are standing and laughing. They weren't even friends. They didn't know each other before that night. And suddenly they're best buds. 5. The guys can go from fighting and beating each other up to suddenly being back to friends. Are you guys really friends? Is it just taking frustration out on each other? What is it and how? 6, why is it that if I send you a message that has three plus parts, you only respond to the least important part? If I'm like, hey, I saw our mutual friend while running errands, let Me know what you want for dinner. I'm about to go pick it up. And did you take out the trash? Get a response that says, oh, yeah, Dave, haven't seen him in a while. 7. He uses my expensive shampoo to wash his whole body when there is a bar of soap right there. 8. My wife says she never understood how my friend walks into the apartment and go straight to the kitchen and grab stuff to eat, drink like it's his own home on top of it. L don't give AF she says she could never do with her girlfriends.

I have a personal sauce that I make for burgers and she asks if it has mustard in it. I say no. She loves it and I've made it multiple times since then. She's even requested it a few times. Little does she know it has a decent amount of mustard in it. 2. Yes, I would love to travel six hours to see your family. 3, my girlfriend can't sleep sometimes. I told her there is a pressure point on her lower neck that if pressed induces sleepiness. When she can't sleep, I will press on it to placebo her to, into getting tired and falling asleep. 4, me and my husband live in an area where it doesn't rain frequently, but when it does, we get a ton of snails. He would get sad because we'd see some snails that have been stepped on. So I told him that they were an invasive species so he wouldn't feel so bad about them getting smushed. Five, our child took their first steps when I was visiting my parents a few hours away while my husband was at work. Later that evening, he got home shortly after I did, and our daughter took a few steps toward him when he came in the house. He got extremely excited thinking those were her first steps. So I just went with it and got Excited too. She's 14 now. I've never told him the truth. 6. He's a chef and I'm a picky eater. I don't want to complain because he still took the time to make it and I can't cook at all. 7. Yeah, I really enjoy it when your brother and his wife come visit us. Cannot stand either one of them and find his brother to be an obnoxious idiot. 8. I insist that his old man Flemmy Sinus clearing coughs in the morning don't bother me. He can't help it. But man, they are rough and gross to listen to. 9. I've never told my husband what a horrible dancer he is. Horrible. He always wants to dance, but I usually tell him I'm tired or my feet hurt. If the dance floor is crowded, I'll dance with him. But in the middle of the dance floor, surrounded by people. Love that man to death. Though he has a million amazing qualities and I'm the luckiest woman alive also, I'm pretty sure he could name quite a few things about me that he's not too fond of. 10. I never lie to my spouse. Tried once to withhold that I won $500 on a scratch ticket and told on myself before I got my coat off. 11. I don't know if this counts, but I tell my girlfriend I'm hungry so she'll also eat something. 12. I once claimed to have made the sauce for a meal when it Was out of a bottle.

One, I was stabbed in the neck by someone robbing my house. I totally thought I was going to die. I hate myself, but I begged the guy who stabbed me to stay because I didn't want to die alone. He said sorry and walked away. That fucking broke my heart. Thankfully, he called 9 1 1 for me. 2. Was run over by a bus last year. My thought when I went under the tires was, but it's a Wednesday. 3. I was in a fight and I didn't know I was stabbed in the liver and the lung. I walked away with my friend and collapsed in an alley. I remember bleeding out with calming waves of euphoria washing over me and I thought, I've lived enough. I'm okay with this. Blacked out and woke up in the back of an ambulance with waves of immense pain assaulting my body. Dying isn't awful. Surviving is awful. 4. Your shoe is untied. I said that to my dad before promptly falling down a 20F cliff into the underbrush. Broken arm, fractured skull, ruptured kidney. Woke up two weeks later to my dad saying thanks for letting him know his shoe was untied as he could have tripped. 5. I was in the process of being electrocuted having been working all day at top of Scissors lift. The electricians had left a 2 77 volt line live and While I was standing and reaching while running the last low voltage run of the job, I contacted their line. I saw the white light at the end of the tunnel. All I knew was throbbing and 60 cycle noise in the white light. My last thought was, I wonder if I can tell my knees to unlock. Obviously they did. Since I am here typing this, several electrical burns. Still here living the life. 6, my heart stopped beating for seven seconds while I was eating dinner in my hospital bed waiting to be discharged. I realized I was going to pass out and put my arm across my plate so I wouldn't fall face first into it. All I could think of was this is gonna make a mess. Glad they took their time with the paperwork. Ended up walking out of there seven days later with a pacemaker at the age of 46. Seven. That's it. As I looked at the surface of the water, I couldn't reach. 8. I remember having a piece of food lodged into my throat at a young age. I was standing there thinking, well, this is it and I just accepted it. I really don't understand it because I'm terrified of death. So I don't get how I just accepted it. But yeah. 9, as I was getting the hemlock, I remember thinking how embarrassing it would be to die at a Renaissance fair. 10. I thought about how I didn't. Buy enough pizzas from my favorite pizza place. It's pretty good. But thinking about pizza when you think you're dying is pretty depressing in retrospect. 11, I almost died in a fiery explosion at my old job. My first thought was, I'm gonna look like such an idiot without eyebrows.

One. My company, as part of its alcohol policy, you should not drink for at least four hours before coming to work. When engineers got called about production problems over the weekend, they all just had a beer, but could be there in about four or five hours. Two. In my dorm, if you did something that triggered the smoke fire alarm, you had to do a safety presentation for everyone on your floor. This was intended to deter pranksters from pulling the alarm. A guy on our floor was making grilled cheese in the kitchenette and burned it, which legitimately triggered the fire alarm. Afterwards, he explained, assuming that since it had been a legitimate alarm and not a prank, that he wouldn't have to do a presentation. He was, of course, wrong. So the next Wednesday night, the entire floor assembled and we were treated to a 30 minute safety presentation on the dangers of grilled cheese sandwiches. It contained literally nothing about fire safety. It was all choking hazards and cholesterol. Our RA was furious, but the student pointed out that the write up that he'd been given just said safety presentation. We didn't get any more presentations after that. 3. If you violated the dress code policy, you had to wear these really big gray sweatpants or sweatshirts that said DCV in big orange letters. Dress code violation. It became A thing to get caught because they were apparently really comfortable. When the admin finally caught on that people were trying to get them on purpose, they changed it so that you got in school suspension. Jokes on them for that too. Lots of kids preferred that over being in class 4. If you return a library book late, your parents would have to return it and explain why it's late. It worked about as well as you would think. The rule lasted a few months before they figured it wasn't worth the cost of replacing all the books. Kid I can't return this book. Parent why not? Kid it's late. Parent so? Kid school says you have to do it and tell them why I didn't return it on time. Parent oh well, I guess they aren't getting it back, are they? 5. It wasn't a school wide policy, but I had a super bitchy French teacher who would constantly hand out detentions for things as inconsequential as walking to the trash can to throw away a piece of paper. She absolutely could not deal with the fact that we periodically might need to actually leave our chairs for a perfectly valid reason. One day she locked herself out of the classroom and nobody would let her back in. Sorry, we aren't allowed to get out of our seats. She had to get the janitor. Six when I was in kindergarten during the morning announcements. One day they came On and said, and please no throwing snowballs, there is a chance you might accidentally get some rocks in them. You could see on the faces of all 20 some students the realization that, OMG, we could put rocks in them.

One. My girlfriend hates mustard. I have a personal sauce that I make for burgers and she asks if it has mustard in it. I say no. She loves it and I've made it multiple times since then. She's even requested it a few times. Little does she know, it has a decent amount of mustard in it. 2. Yes, I would love to travel six hours to see your family. 3. My girlfriend can't sleep sometimes. I told her there is a pressure point on her lower neck that, if pressed, induces sleepiness. When she can't sleep, I will press on it to placebo her to into getting tired and falling asleep. 4. Me and my husband live in an area where it doesn't rain frequently, but when it does, we get a ton of snails. He would get sad because we'd see some snails that have been stepped on, so I told him that they were an invasive species so he wouldn't feel so bad about them getting smushed. Five. Our child took their first steps when I was visiting my parents a few hours away while my husband was at work later that evening. He got home shortly after I did, and our daughter took a few steps toward him when he came in the house. He got extremely excited thinking those were her first steps, so I just went with it and got Excited too. She's 14 now. I've never told him the truth. 6. He's a chef and I'm a picky eater. I don't want to complain because he still took the time to make it and I can't cook at all. 7 yeah, I really enjoy it when your brother and his wife come visit us. Cannot stand either one of them and find his brother to be an obnoxious idiot. 8. I insist that his old man Flemmy sinus clearing coughs in the morning don't bother me. He can't help it, but man they are rough and gross to listen to. 9. I've never told my husband what a horrible dancer he is. Horrible. He always wants to dance, but I usually tell him I'm tired or my feet hurt. If the dance floor is crowded, I'll dance with him. But in the middle of the dance floor, surrounded by people? Love that man to death though. He has a million amazing qualities and I'm the luckiest woman alive. Also, I'm pretty sure he could name quite a few things about me that he's not too fond of. 10. I never lie to my spouse. Tried once to withhold that I won $500 on a scratch ticket and told on myself before I got my coat off. 11. I don't know if this counts, but I tell my girlfriend I'm hungry so she'll also eat something. 12. I once claimed to have made the sauce for a meal when it Was out of a bottle

So many have been wondering with the big AJ Lee return, was she gonna be back just for a one off match or was she gonna be back for a big time return? Well it has been reported by multiple sources now that she has signed a multi year contract and it was confirmed with this picture as well. And she's already set her eyes on that IC title. After Friday Night Smackdown went off air, she was seen with multiple different videos and pictures of her holding the IC Title, skipping around the ring with it. And she looked absolutely amazing with this belt. And while she did look a bit winded, obviously it's her first time back, so I'm expecting that she'll get right back in the ring shape within like a couple of months. Which does mean that she probably won't be having an IC Championship match at verse Becky Lynch at Wrestlepalooza, but instead having a set in Becky versus CM punk and AJ Lee match where they'll win and then eventually she'll get her IC Title shot against Becky Lynch. Probably loses the first time and then gets a second time afterwards. And then from there she's had multiple upon multiple options to be able to go against, whether it be Rock, San Perez, Live, Morgan, Rhea Ripley. We're likely gonna be getting Nikki Bella, probably even Natalia as Well, if it's Natty Nihar, that's gonna be even more amazing, because I made an entire video on how much history these two women have with each other, which you definitely should go check out. And there is the Four Horsewomen that she could wrestle as well. Those being Becky Lynch, Charlotte Flair, Bailey, and possibly even Mercedes Monae. Not only is it more or less confirmed that her contract will be ending next year, but there's also a lot of speculation that she may return to WWE. And now this might be the big reason why she does go back. Talked before about wanting an AJ Lee match. All the Four Horsemen have talked about this as well. And hey, man, I don't care where it happens at. I just need to see Mercedes Mendez versus AJ Lee one time in my life. Those are my 1 and two right there. I need that match. Oh, yeah. Now, there's plenty of matches that could be happening with AJ Lee. I think it's gonna be great when she does get the IC title. I think it's gonna be just be great having her back because of all the awesome matches that we could get. And I'm glad that she gonna be here for at least, at the very bare minimum, two years.

Waylon was with his mother and his mother's boyfriend at the time. This is the mom, Kelsey, and this is the boyfriend, Bobby Gibson. Those two are being held in the Little River County Jail on a charge of injury to a child. It says that Gibson was arrested on Christmas Day, but the mother is also facing felony charges. The investigation determined that the injuries were a result of the mother's boyfriend and happened in Little River County. There's really not much else out there, but looking at these picture of little Waylon, he clearly went through hell. So while everybody was enjoying their Christmas Day, this is what Waylon was going through. This was the result he is make. He has lots of support from his family. This is his father, Dylan Simpson. I will tag him below. I have his permission to share this information. But Waylon is going to need extensive treatment for a long time, including even therapy to get over the emotional damage that happened as well as the physical. This baby was in this mother's care and she let this happen from her boyfriend. And from the look of his picture, he doesn't look very remorsefully. Looks really smug. And this is disgusting. So I'm happy to blast his face on here. I hope that Waylon can get the justice that he deserves. In the meantime, Waylon and his family need our help to help him recover. There is a gofundme. The link is going to be in my bio. I'll let you pause and read some of the information here. And I'm going to leave you with a really heartbreaking video of Waylon. Hey, can I get a bite? Come on, give daddy high five. Oh, good job, knuckles. Oh, good job, buddy.

My ex husband remarried three years ago to this woman, Beth, who came with twin daughters Madison and Mackenzie. They're both 15, same age as my daughter Chloe. When Chloe stays there every other weekend, she has to share a room with both of them because apparently there's no space for her to have her own room in their four bedroom house. Last month, Chloe came back from her dad's place looking exhausted. I asked what was wrong and she just shrugged it off like usual. But when she fell asleep on the couch at seven PM, I knew something was up. My kid never goes to sleep early unless she's sick. The next weekend she came back looking even worse, dark circles under her eyes, cranky all day, complaining about everything. Finally, I cornered her in the kitchen while she was making cereal. What's really going on at your dad's place, I asked. She stirred her lucky charms for like a full minute before answering. The twins think it's funny to make me sleep on the floor. They told me their beds are too good for someone who doesn't really belong in their family. My stomach dropped. What do you mean sleep on the floor? She looked up at me with these tired eyes. They took my pillow and blanket the first night and hid them when I asked, dad. And Beth about it. Madison said I was lying and that I probably just lost them. Beth believed her instead of me. I felt my face getting hot. Where does your dad think you sleep in the bed with them. That's what they tell him. But every night after everyone's asleep, they wake me up and make me get on the floor. They say if I tell dad, they'll make sure he knows what a troublemaker I am and maybe he won't want me visiting anymore. That was it. I grabbed my phone and called my ex immediately. Your daughters are making Chloe sleep on the floor, I said as soon as he picked up. What? That's not true. She shares the bed with them. Ask them right now if that's what really happens at night. There was silence and I heard him calling for the girls. Five minutes later, he called back. They admit they've been making her get on the floor, but they say it's because she kicks in her sleep and keeps them awake. the solution is to make a 15 year old girl sleep on a hardwood floor with no pillow or blanket? Are you insane? We'll figure something out, he said. But I could tell he was already making excuses in his head. No, we won't. I've already figured it out. The next Friday when it was time for Chloe to go to her dad's, I drove her straight to the Hampton Inn down The street from his house. Instead, I walked up to the front desk with my credit card. I need a room for my daughter for the weekend, just her. She's 15. The desk clerk looked confused. Is there an adult staying with her? No, but her father lives two minutes away. If there's an emergency, here's his number. I handed over a piece of paper with my ex.

The reunion was at Lake Tahoe. 60 relatives I hadn't seen since I was 12, all pretending we were some perfect family. My sister Katie had organized the whole thing, rented this massive cabin, matching t shirts with Henderson Family Reunion 2019 in cursive, a photographer, the works. I should have known something was up when they insisted I ride separately. Your car has better gas mileage, dad said. Follow us. We'll stop for lunch halfway. The drive from Portland was eight hours. I'd taken three days off from my job at the bookstore, or spent money I didn't have on gas and a gift for my grandma's 80th. Katie had guilted me for months about missing family events. You never show up for anything, she'd said. Just this once, please. Halfway through Nevada, they pulled into a Chevron outside Reno. Desert heat shimmering off the asphalt. I parked behind Dad's Escalade, went inside for Red Bull and trail mix. The cashier was counting change for some kid buying candy. Maybe three minutes total. When I came out, they were recording me on their phones through the windows, laughing as they peeled out of the parking lot. Mom was filming from the passenger seat. Even my teenage nephew Jake, had his phone up. The group text lit up immediately. 23 messages before I could even process what happened. Hope you brought a map. First one home wins. It's just a prank. Bro, don't be such a baby. Katie sent a gift of someone crying. They thought I'd panic. Panic, call them crying, beg for help. Classic Marcus. Right, the sensitive one. The theater kid who cried during Pixar movies. The one who still went to therapy. The one they called too soft at every family dinner. I sat in my Honda for 20 minutes, engine off, reading their messages. Dad posted a video to the family Facebook group. 67 likes, comments flooding in. Hilarious. Marcus will laugh about this later. Great prank. My aunt commented. He probably needs this. Toughen him up. That's when something shifted. This crystalline moment of clarity. They didn't leave me as a joke. They left me because they genuinely thought I needed to be taught a lesson. About what? Being myself. I turned my car around and drove to San Francisco. No dramatic goodbye text, no explanation. Just turned off my phone and drove west toward the bay. Found a hostel in the tenderloin that first night. Sketchy as hell, but it was 40 bucks and they didn't ask questions. Found a studio apartment that same week. Fourth floor, walk up in the mission. Bars on the windows. Radiator that sounded like it was dying, but it was mine. Bartending job at this dive called the Broken Clock. The owner, Tommy, was this ex Marine who hired me on the spot when I made him laugh during the interview. Deleted Facebook, changed my number the hardest Part was explaining to my old co workers why I needed my last paycheck mailed to a California address. For three months, I built a new life, made friends with the other bartenders, started dating this girl, Sarah, who worked at the coffee shop next door. Joined a community theatre group. Nobody knew about my family. I was just Marcus from Portland who moved for a fresh start. Then the email started. Six months after the Chevron incident, my cousin Derek sent an email to my work address. The one from the bookstore website, apparently

What happened afterwards with your life? I've been dating Sophia for four years when I finally decided to ask the big question. Her parents treated me like their own son, especially after they found out I grew up in foster care. Her little brother would literally follow me around their house, begging me to teach him how to fix engines. Someone who never had a real family, being part of theirs felt like everything I've been missing my whole life. I've been saving every extra dollar from my job at Murphy's Auto Shop for months. The ring wasn't fancy, just a simple band with a small diamond. But it was real, and it was all I could afford. I planned everything perfectly. Sophia's dad was turning 60, and they were throwing this big backyard BBQ. All her family would be there, plus her closest friends. She always said family was the most important thing to her, so I figured proposing surrounded by everyone who loved us both would be perfect. The party was going great. Sophia's mom made her famous brisket. Her dad was telling embarrassing stories about Sophia as a kid, and everyone was laughing and having a good time. After they brought out the birthday cake and saying happy birthday, I figured it was the perfect moment. My hands were shaking as I tapped my beer bottle with a fork to get everyone's attention. The whole backyard went dead silent. Sophia looked confused. At first. Then her eyes went wide. When I got down on one knee and pulled out the ring box, her mom gasped and started tearing up. Her dad had this huge smile on his face. Her friends were already pulling out their phones to record the moment. I opened the box and said all the things I've been practicing in my head for weeks. How much I loved her, how she changed my life, how I wanted to spend forever making her happy. The words just poured out of me. But Sophia just stood there, frozen. Not good. Frozen like she was overwhelmed with happiness. Add frozen like she'd seen a ghost. Liam, she finally said, and I could hear the panic in her voice, I love you so much, but I'm not ready for this. I'm so sorry. The silence that followed was the worst sound I'd ever heard. 30 people just staring at us, not knowing what to do or where to look. I stayed on one knee for probably five seconds too long, trying to process what had just happened. Then, and I slowly stood up, shoved the ring box back in my pocket, and nodded. Okay, I said, because what else could I say? Sophia reached for my arm, but I stepped back. I couldn't deal with her trying to comfort me in front of everyone. I mumbled something about needing to go and walked straight to my truck. The drive home was the longest. 20 minutes of my life. I stayed up all night staring at the ceiling, replaying every conversation we'd ever had. About the future. We talked about getting married, about kids, about buying a house together. How had I read everything so wrong? The next day, I was under the hood of a broken down Chevy trying to lose myself in work, when I heard footsteps approaching. I looked up expecting to see my boss, but it was so.

Someone stole my mountain bike from my apartment's bike rack last month. This wasn't some cheap Walmart bike, it was a 2,800 dollar trek that I'd saved for months to buy. I filed a police report, but honestly I didn't expect much help. The bike had GPS tracking built into the frame, part of the anti theft package I paid extra for. Most thieves don't know about embedded trackers. So I pulled up the app to see where my bike ended up. It was moving through downtown, then stopped at an address about 3 miles away. I waited a few hours to see if it would move again, but it stayed put. The GPS showed it was in someone's garage. I drove over to check it out. Sketchy neighborhood, run down houses, and sure enough, it was my bike. In this guy's open garage next to about six other expensive bikes that definitely didn't belong to him. Here's the thing. I couldn't just call the cops and say my bike is in that garage. They'd need proof it was actually mine, and this guy would probably just deny everything. So I came up with a plan. I went home and printed out fake flyers advertising a cash for bikes business. Made it look like I was buying used bikes, no questions asked. The next day I knocked on the guy's door. Mid 30s, covered in tattoos. Looked exactly like someone who'd Steal bikes for a living. Hey, man, I saw you've got some nice bikes in your garage, I said, showing him the flyer. I buy bikes for cash. Interested in selling any? His eyes lit up immediately. Yeah, I've got some bikes. What kind of prices are you talking? Depends on the condition and model. Mind if I take a look? He LED me straight to the garage, where I counted eight stolen bikes, including mine. My Trek was right there. Still had the custom handlebar grips I'd installed. This Trek looks nice, I said, examining my own bike. How much you want for it? That's a good one, he replied. I'm thinking $800. Perfect. He was trying to sell me my own stolen bike. Tell you what, I said, I'm interested in this track, but I need to check with my business partner about the price. Can I get your contact info and maybe come back tomorrow? He gave me his name, Danny, and his phone number. I told him I'd call him later. As soon as I got home, I called the police and explained the situation. I had GPS evidence showing my bike at his

When I turned 15, my mom went from strict to straight up paranoid. One night after dinner, she plopped down next to me with this weird smile and said she was installing a family safety app on my phone. I watched her tap away, giving herself access to everything, my location, photos, texts, even my drafts on social media. It's just to keep you safe, honey, she said, handing my phone back like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. It felt like having a stalker who lived in my house. At first I tried to be cool about it. Maybe it would calm her down, right? Wrong. Things got insane fast. She text me in the middle of conversations asking who I was with. She'd comment on memes I hadn't even posted yet because she was reading my drafts. Worst part, she started replying to my friends pretending to be me. My buddy Jake texted asking if I wanted to hang out. And my mom replied, sure thing, buddy, with way too many exclamation points. Jake called me laughing, asking why I was texting like a soccer mom. I had no idea what he meant until I checked my messages. Then came the day that broke me. I was in history class when Mrs. Wilson pulled me aside. She looked uncomfortable as hell. Liam, your mother called the school. She's concerned about some message you sent about Me? My stomach dropped. I knew exactly what she meant. I texted my best friend Kyle the night before, joking about how our history teacher's haircut looked like she stuck her finger in an electrical socket. It was just stupid, but friend stuff, not meant for anyone else. But my mom had read it and called the school to complain about my private joke. I wanted to disappear into the floor. By lunch, Kyle wasn't talking to me. Neither was Jake. Word got around that my mom was reading everything and suddenly nobody wanted to text me anymore. Some kids even blocked me. It was like my social life had a disease and the disease was my mom. That night, I stared at my phone feeling trapped. But then I noticed something. The tracking app worked both ways. It logged every time someone accessed the account. I spent hours studying those logs and what I found made my skin crawl. My mom wasn't just checking my phone during the day. She was logging in at 1:00am, 2:00am, even 3:00am. She was forwarding my messages to her laptop. She was screenshotting my photos. He was living inside my phone 24 7. So I came up with a plan. I created a fake friend named Daniel, made up this whole persona, gave him a backstory, even found some random photos online to use as his profile pic on a group chat with myself.

He said, wouldn't you rather drive straight to the hospital? Is this some sort of joke? I asked when the officer said those strange words. Instead of asking for license and registration, the cop handed back my license that I'd already pulled out. His face had changed from stern authority to something softer and sadder. I just got radioed in about what happened. I'm terribly sorry for your loss, sir. Before I could ask what loss? He was already jogging back to his patrol car. He turned on his lights again, but this time pulled in front of me and blocked traffic so I could merge left immediately. Other cars moved aside as he created a clear path for me to speed the head. I sat there frozen for a moment before pressing the gas. My hands were trembling on the steering wheel as I tried to process what just happened. The cop knew something I didn't. Something bad enough that he'd let me go without even a warning about my speed. I fumbled for my phone while keeping one eye on the road. I just landed at LAX an hour ago after a three day business trip to see Seattle. My wife Carly hadn't answered when I called from baggage claim, but that wasn't unusual. She often had her phone on silent while teaching her kindergarten class. I called her again. Straight to voicemail. I tried our home phone. Nothing. My chest Started feeling tight as I scrolled to her sister's number. Voicemail. Her mom. Voicemail. My mom. No answer. The highway stretched ahead of me, but I wasn't really seeing it anymore. My mind was racing through possibilities. Car accident, house fire, something at her school. Each scenario worse than the last. The cop had said lost. That word kept echoing in my head. Finally, I called my brother Harvey. It rang four times before his wife, Paulina, answered. She was crying so hard, I could barely understand her. How can she do this? I don't understand why she would do this. Paulina kept repeating between sobs, what? What happened? Where's Carly? Is she okay? I was practically shouting into the phone. Paulina just cried harder. I heard Harvey's voice in the background telling her to give him the phone. There shuffling and muffled voices before the line went dead. I called back three times, but no one answered. I was doing 90 now, weaving between cars. Other drivers honked, but I didn't care. Something had happened to my wife, and no one would tell me what. The exit was coming up, and I took it without signaling. I knew that's where they take her. It was the closest trauma center to her school. The hospital parking lot was a maze, but I abandoned my car in the first spot I saw. Legal or not, I didn't care. I ran through the sliding doors into the emergency room lobby. The smell. Of disinfectant, and fear hit me immediately. I'm looking for my wife, Carly Munos. She was brought here. I didn't even know when or why. The nurse at the desk typed something into her computer. When she looked back up at me, her eyes were watery. She. I knew who I was before I'd even given my name. The security guard will escort you. Her voice was barely a whisper. A large man in a blue uniform appeared and gestured for me to follow. We walked through endless hallways, past rooms full of beeping machines and worried families. My legs felt like they might give out, but I kept moving. The guard didn't say a word, just kept glancing at me with that same sad look everyone seemed to have. We took an elevator to the third floor pediatric ICU. The sign said, why were we in pediatrics if Carly was hurt? My brain couldn't make sense of it. The guard LED me down another hallway, where I could hear crying. Multiple people sobbing behind a closed door. I recognized voices as we got closer. Harvey. Paulina. Carly.

But her face immediately dropped when she realised that we tricked her. My sister in law, Maya, has always been competitive with me since the day I married her brother, Jake. She couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, I tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me and from the moment we announced became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd flash, she'd push harder. Come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nursery and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail when she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages, desperately searching for any evidence of Our name decision. My husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and you first. She wouldn't do that, he said. But I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created a blank interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with Final Decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition and I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think, she'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived. The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations. But I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to her surprise. The next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness. When I walked into her room. She actually had the audacity to say, I hope you don't mind that we ended up using Aurora when she was born. It just felt so right for our daughter. I know you guys were considering it, too. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed her our real pic.

Now they're homeless with kids and I refuse to let them back in my life. When I was 22, I inherited our grandmother's house, a beautiful Victorian with enough space for my brother and his family to stay while they saved for their own place. They moved in with their two kids, promising it would only be temporary, just six months. My brother assured me, we'll be out of your hair before you know it. His wife despised me from day 1. She'd make snide comments about how I decorated, complained that I was too loud when I came home from my nursing shifts and acted like I was invading her space in my own house. She'd rearrange my kitchen without asking, throw away my mail, claiming it was junk, and lecture me about proper household management while I was paying all the bills. The passive aggression escalated weekly. She'd use my expensive shampoo, then deny it when confronted. My leftovers would disappear from the fridge and she'd claim she thought they were communal food when I started labelling everything with my name. She complained to my brother that I was being petty and territorial. I tried talking to my brother about her behaviour, but he always made excuses. She's stressed about money. She's not used to living with other people. You're being too sensitive. Every conversation ended with him defending her and dismissing my concerns. The breaking point came six Months later, I arrived home exhausted from a double shift to find her screaming at me in the hallway. She claimed I've been stealing money from her purse and eating her food from the fridge. Both accusations were ridiculous. I made decent money and kept my own groceries clearly labeled. You've been sneaking into our room, she shrieked, her face red with manufactured rage. I know you took $40 from my wallet last Tuesday. I stared at her in disbelief. I worked 12 hour shifts. When exactly would I have time to rifle through your belongings? Don't lie to me, she spat. I have proof. My brother stood behind her, silent as she launched into a tirade about how I was jealous of their family and trying to sabotage their marriage. When I tried to defend myself, she burst into tears and ran to their room. That night, my brother knocked on my door. His face was stone cold, a look I'd never seen directed at me before. We need to talk, he said. He told me his wife had been documenting everything. Times I allegedly took money, instances where I supposedly threatened her when he wasn't around, photos of missing food items. None of it was true, but he believed every word. She'd created a detailed log with dates, times and descriptions of my supposed crimes. You're toxic and you're tearing our family apart, he said. We're done enabling your behavior. I stared at him in disbelief. This was The same brother who'd cry.

What happened? I woke up during throat surgery when I was 23. They had me knocked out to remove some polyps on my vocal cords, but something went horribly wrong with the anesthesia. When I first opened my eyes, I couldn't move a muscle. I was completely paralyzed from the medicine, but fully conscious. Everything felt muffled at first, like I was underwater. Then I started hearing snippets of conversation. The surgeon was discussing a baseball game with the nurse while he worked on my throat. I tried to scream to let them know I was awake, but my body wouldn't respond. I. I could feel everything. The cold metal of the tools sliding down my throat. The burning sensation as they cut away the growths. The metallic taste of blood pooling at the back of my mouth. But I couldn't even twitch a finger to signal I was conscious. My heart was pounding so hard, I thought it would burst. But the monitors didn't show any change. The paralytic they gave me was working perfectly. Too perfectly. I was trapped in my own body, forced to experience every excruciating second. At one point, the surgeon made a joke about my tattoos. Look at all this ink, he said. Wonder what her parents think. The nurse laughed and said something about kids these days. I wanted to cry, but couldn't even do that. Then things got worse. I felt this sharp, searing pain as something Went wrong. The surgeon swore under his breath. Damn it, we've got a bleeder. My throat was filling with blood faster than they could suction it out. The calm discussion about baseball was replaced with urgent commands. BP is dropping. Get me more suction. Where's that clamp? I. I could feel myself choking, drowning in my own blood, but still couldn't move. That's when the anesthesiologist finally noticed something was off with my readings. He rushed to adjust something in my IV, and everything started fading to black. The last thing I heard was him saying, she's fighting the paralytic. When I woke up in recovery, the nurse asked how I was feeling. I wrote on my notepad. I heard everything. The baseball game, the joke about my tattoos, the bleeding. Her face went white. They pulled my records and discovered my body had metabolized the anesthesia way faster than normal, but the paralytic had stayed at full strength. Apparently, it's a rare genetic condition that runs in my family, something my mom forgot to mention. The hospital tried to sweep it all under the rug. They offered to waive all my medical bills if I sign some papers promising not to sue. But that wasn't what I wanted. I just wanted them to document my case so it wouldn't happen to anyone else. The surgeon and anesthesiologist came to apologize later that day. The surgeon looked like he hadn't slept in days. He kept saying how sorry he was. About the tattoo comments, I wrote back the baseball game was more offensive. Yankees suck. But here's the crazy part. When they checked the surgery recording, apparently they film everything for teaching purposes. They found something disturbing during the bleeding incident.

I was 22, living my best life when my phone exploded with calls from my entire family. My cousin Eve, who was 16, told everyone I'd been sneaking into her room and that she was now pregnant with my baby. The whole family believed her instantly. My parents screamed at me over the phone, calling me disgusting. My siblings blocked me on everything. Even my grandparents, who raised me, wouldn't take my calls. I had zero proof it wasn't true. Eve was the family princess, and I was just a black sheep cousin who barely came around anymore. The accusation spread like wildfire through our tight knit extended family. Aunts and uncles who used to invite me to barbecues suddenly acted like I didn't exist. My mom's sister, Eve's mother, posted cryptic Facebook statuses about protecting our children from predators in our own family. Within a week, I was completely erased from every family group chat, every holiday plan, every. Every graduation announcement. The next year destroyed me completely. I waited every day for police to show up at my door with handcuffs. Every knock made my heart stop. Every phone call from an unknown number sent me into a panic attack. I lost my job at the auto shop because I couldn't focus. Kept making mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss finally sat me down and said, whatever was Going on at home. Needed to stay there, but I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment three months later when I couldn't make rent. Moved in with a buddy who let me crash on his couch. But even he started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Started drinking heavily just to sleep and drinking to get through the day. Then drinking because breathing felt impossible without it. Dating became a nightmare. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried to date asked to meet my parents. After two months, I made up some story about them being dead. Second girl saw through the lies when she noticed I had zero family photos, no childhood stories, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. And when I couldn't give a straight answer, she was gone by morning. The isolation was crushing. Holidays were the worst. Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call. I drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway, knowing they were all inside without me. I finally moved three states away and started completely over. New job, new friends, new identity. Told everyone I met that my family lived far away and we weren't close. Simple, clean lie that people accepted. Got into therapy, got sober, worked my ass off to build something resembling a normal life.

My parents were so worried about me dating a skater boy, they couldn't imagine he'd be the reason I'm still alive today. A few nights ago, my parents found out about my skater boyfriend, Greggy, when his message popped up on my screen at dinner. I love you, too. Who the heck are you talking to? My mom shouted, glaring at the screen of my phone. You're 14. No dating until you're 30. We were very clear. Dad pulled up Greggy's Instagram on his own phone. Border, really? This is who you're risking your future for? I tried to reason with them, but they refused to listen and forced me to block him everywhere. Right there over dinner. You'll thank us when you're in college, mom said, while I sobbed. My friends tried passing messages between us at school, but my parents found out and threatened to call their parents. Eventually, everyone gave up except for Gregorius. Gregorius showed up mysteriously in my Valorant lobby. Hey, Mel, it's been a while, he said, his voice breaking. I miss you, Mel. I know we're not supposed to talk, but let's at least play like we used to. We started meeting in the lobbies every day after that, just playing and chatting about normal things, school friends. My strict parent, he never once tried to convince me to sneak around or meet up in person. He never complained about my Parents or tried to turn me against them when I vent about how unfair they were being, he'd actually defend them. Sometimes they're just scared, he said once my older sister got mixed up with some bad people in high school. Parents get paranoid. He still cared about me in all the ways that mattered. When I failed my chemistry test because I couldn't focus, he spent three hours teaching me balancing equations over discord. When my grandmother got sick, he stayed up until 3:00am just listening to me cry. You can always reach me here, he promised. I don't care what time it is. Mom almost caught us once when she walked by while discord was open. I clicked to my game lobby just in time. Homework break, she asked. I nodded and switched back to my essay. My heart pounding so hard I thought she'd hear it. After she left, Greggy messaged, maybe we should stop. I don't want to get you in trouble, but I couldn't lose him again. He was the only person who I could rely on and thank god I didn't lose him because a couple of days later, my friend Sarah and I got caught up in some shady business. It was supposed to be a normal Saturday night sleepover. Her parents went out for their anniversary, leaving us to watch movies and eat junk food. I was on the phone messaging Greggy on discord when Sarah's older brother Joshua came home from College, completely wasted with two other friends. Sarah immediately tensed up. baby sis and baby girl, he winked disgustingly. He and his friends sat beside us on the sofa, placing his arm over my shoulder, constantly whispering things like, I know you're not as innocent as you act and your parents don't have to know. I pushed his face away and stood up, glaring, can you stop? Sarah was almost crying, begging me not to make him mad. He gets mean when he's drunk, she whispered. Just ignore him and he'll pass out soon. But when Joshua grabbed my waist and tried to pull me onto his lap, I grabbed Sarah's arm and ran to the bathroom, quickly locking the door. He started pounding on it, laughing with his friends about how I was playing hard to get and needed to loosen up. Sarah hopped into the tub, hugging her knees to her chest. I patted my pockets, realizing I had left my phone in the living room. Soon the knocks on the door became angrier. Hitting the door harder, jiggling the handle aggressively, Sarah meekly handed me her phone. I'm so sorry. I had no idea he'd be home. She tried calling her parents, but they didn't pick up. And I didn't have my own parents number.

An old man came up to me and asked, can you slowly take off your shirt? You did he get away from me. I grabbed my beach bag and started to stand up to leave. Wait, you don't understand. Don't move! He held up both hands looking panicked. Get away from here! I'll call the cops. I was already reaching for my phone because this creep needed to be reported. Call them! You need to go to a hospital. His face was pale despite the summer heat, and he was staring at my back with genuine horror. What? I stopped mid dial because something in his voice made me realize this wasn't what I thought. Don't move! He pulled out a whistle and blew it three sharp times. A teenage lifeguard came running over. Within seconds, the man pointed at my back and the lifeguard's eyes went wide. He immediately started yelling for everyone to get out of the lake. Families were grabbing their kids and rushing toward the parking lot. People were looking at me like I had the plague. Ma'am, I need you to stay completely still, lifeguard said in this forced, calm voice. Parker, get Brooke over here now! Another lifeguard jogged over, took one look at my back, and immediately threw up in the sand. What a sissy. Now I was really freaking out what the hell was on me that was making people freak out like this? I tried to turn my Head to see. But both lifeguards yelled at me not to move. Is it a spider? A make? What's on me? My voice was getting higher with each word. The first man who'd approached me was standing a safe distance away. Now I saw them when you sat up to adjust your towel. I've seen this once before, when I was stationed at a lake in Minnesota. We need professionals. The lifeguards were on their radios calling for paramedics. They cleared a huge circle around me like I was radioactive. Other beach goers were taking pictures from far away, and I could hear people speculating about what was happening. Someone said sharks, someone else said jellyfish. But we were at a freshwater lake, so none of that made sense. The Param medics arrived, and two of them approached me slowly, like I was a bomb that might go off. One of them let out a low whistle when he saw my back. Okay, ma'am, we're going to need you to stay very still. This might feel strange, but do not move, no matter what. The older paramedic put on thick gloves and opened a medical kit. I felt scraping on my back. Not painful exactly, but like someone was peeling tape off my skin. Then I heard dropping sounds. Plop, plop, plop, like wet things hitting the sand. With each drop, I felt relief on my back, like pressure was being released. How many are there? The younger paramedic sounded. Disgusted. I'm counting at least 15 so far. Maybe 20. Never seen them this big. The scraping continued. My back started to sting just a little, then more and more. With each scraping motion, whatever was coming off was leaving something behind. The stinging turned to burning. I felt dizzy, and my vision started getting blurry around the edges. She's going into shock. We need to speed this up. The older paramedic worked faster. More plopping sounds, more burning. I looked down and saw dark drops.

When I turned 8, my parents threw me this huge party. All my friends came. We had a bouncy house, pizza, the works. I felt like the luckiest kid in the world. But right as we were about to cut my Ninja Turtles cake, my mom pulled me aside with this panicked look. Honey, we need to tell everyone to go home right now. Daddy is very sick and needs to go to the hospital. I was devastated. My friends left confused. I'm crying because they thought someone was dying. The bouncy house guy packed up while I sat there in my party hat, watching my perfect day crumble. Dad spent three days in the hospital for what they said was a severe stomach infection. I felt so guilty for being upset about my ruined party when he was suffering. But this became a pattern. Every single birthday for the next 10 years, some crisis would strike right before or during my Celebration. When I turned nine, my mom got food poisoning an hour before my sleepover. When I turned 10, my grandma fell down the stairs during my bowling party. 11 was my dad's appendix acting up. 12 was our car breaking down on the way to the amusement park. By 13, I started having panic attacks before my birthday. I'd wake up wondering what disaster would ruin it this time. My friends stopped expecting invitations. Some parents whispered that our family Was cursed or unlucky. I began asking for quiet celebrations instead. Just cake at home, please. But even then, something always went wrong. The power would go out, someone would get injured. There was always something. When I turned 16, I didn't even want to party. I just wanted to go to dinner with my parents. But halfway through appetizers, my mom clutched her chest. I. I think I'm having heart palpitations. I started telling people I hated birthdays. Friends thought I was being dramatic. Just bad luck, they'd say. By 17, I was seeing a therapist for what I thought was birthday anxiety disorder. She kept asking about my family dynamics, but I defended them. They can't help that emergencies happen. When I turned 18, I didn't even tell them it was my birthday. I was planning to just let it pass quietly, maybe treat myself to coffee later. But that afternoon, I came home early from school and overheard my parents on the phone with my aunt

Our school have been hyping up anything but a backpack day for weeks and everyone was planning the most ridiculous things to carry their books in, shopping carts, microwaves, even a mini fridge. I spent days planning the perfect entry, a giant inflatable kiddie pool. Not just any pool, but a massive rainbow unicorn pool I found at a garage sale that I was going to fill with text book and drag down the hallway on a rope like a sled. My friends were already calling it legendary. Then two days before the event, some seniors decided to practice by bringing a full sized canoe to school and promptly knocked over three trophy cases trying to navigate the main hallway. Principal Quinn went ballistic and by lunch came the crushing announcement. Due to safety concerns and property damage, anything but a backpack day is officially cancelled. Regular backpacks only. Any student bringing alternative containers will face detention. The appointment was crushing. Everyone had already bought or made their ridiculous book carriers. The hallways were filled with angry muttering about how one group ruined it for everyone. Quinn stood by the main entrance the next morning like a guard, turning away anyone who dared show up with anything creative. She actually made a kid leave his laundry basket in the office and gave him a loner backpack. Safety first, she kept saying. We can't have chaos in the hallways. The Unfairness of it all made my blood boil, but I couldn't let go of my pool idea. I'd already bought the pump, tested the inflation time two minutes flat and even practice dragging it around my garage. So I made a decision that could have gotten me suspended. I folded up the deflated pool as small as possible and stuffed it in my backpack along with the battery powered pump. It barely fit, but I managed to zip it. My plan was simple, show my friends during lunch in the courtyard where Quinn never patrolled. We deflate it for five minutes, take some pictures, have a laugh about what could have been, then pack it away. Nobody would know except my close friends. All morning I felt like I was carrying contraband, which was both nerve racking and oddly thrilling. But everything changed during fifth period biology. We were halfway through a lesson on genetics when Haley Morrison suddenly gasped and grabbed her stomach. Haley was eight months pregnant. She'd been doing remote learning mostly but came in for important labs. Something's wrong, she whispered. Then her eyes went wide. Oh, god, my water just broke. Mrs. Hayes immediately called the office for the nurse, but Nurse Williams was at the elementary school for vision screenings. The EMTs were called, but dispatch said they were 20 minutes out due to a pile up on the highway. Haley's contractions were getting closer. She was crying, saying the baby was coming now That's when Mrs. Hayes yelled, we need something sterile, something to contain. Does anyone have plastic sheets? How anything? The bio lab only had paper towels and a tiny sink. Haley was on the floor and Mrs. Hayes was trying to remember her emergency childbirth training from 20 years ago. Without thinking, I yanked open my backpack. I have a pool. It's brand new, never used. Everyone stared as I pulled out the deflated unicorn pool and the pump. It's clean plastic. It's big enough. It has sides.

When I was 7, I was attacked by a German Shepherd. I nearly died after three surgeries, but I never told my husband grant, because his whole family raises golden retrievers, and they literally have more photos with dogs than with people. On our third date, grant suggested we visit a dog park, and I panicked and said, I'm allergic. When his face just dropped. I added, severely allergic. And now it's been eight years of this ridiculous lie. I carry fake Epipen filled with vitamin water like some kind of spy. I've left 17 birthday parties doing my whole itchy eyes performance. The worst part is our kids beg for a dog every single Christmas, and grant always tells them, you know, mom can't be around dogs, sweetie. I could kill her. I'm literally going to hell. Then after about a week, I started to notice grant has been doing laundry constantly now. Which is weird, because this man once wore the same shirt for a week. He says he just wants to help more, but something feels really off about it. My son suddenly volunteers to take out the trash every single day, and he literally sprints to the garage, then to the bins like he's training for the Olympics. He won't even let me help when the bags are heavy. Meanwhile, my daughter keeps spending time in the garage organizing dad's tools, which makes zero Sense because this girl thinks a Philip's head is a hairstyle. But then I find these muddy paw prints by the garage door yesterday and they're definitely not from a cat like grant claims. Because what cat has paws the size of a toddler's hand? There's creepy scratching sounds from the garage at night and grant says it's probably raccoons. But since when do raccoons whimper? Then credit card Bill comes in and I see it has a 47 dollar charge from Petsmart. Grant says it's fraudulent and he'll handle it, but he never actually calls the bank about it. I find a bag of dog food in Grant's trunk when I'm getting groceries and he says it's for donations at work, but his office doesn't even have a coffee fund, let alone donation drives. This morning I wake up and there's blonde hair on my pillow. That confirms it for me and I'm about to fake a reaction, but then my brain kicks in because if I have an allergic reaction now, grant will wonder why I didn't have one while I was literally sleeping face first in it all night. So I just vacuum it up quickly and pretend I saw nothing. Grant starts testing me at dinner, casually mentions the neighbor got a new puppy and watches my face like he's a detective. So I have to do my whole routine, scratch my arms and sniffle, but he looks suspicious. My son asks mom what happens if Someone with allergies accidentally touches a dog that doesn't know. My heart stops, and I ask why this little boy has the nerve to say, just curious for science class, but I know they're studying volcanoes. My daughter leaves her phone open to Google searches about how to tell if someone is really allergic and can allergies suddenly go away, which makes my stomach drop because my 12 year old is apparently Sherlock Holmes. Now, this morning, grant says he found fur on our bed sheets. He shows me this chunk of long golden fur and said the window was open. Must have blown in from somewhere. So I have to pretend to feel itchy and take a fake Benadryl in front of him. All the while, he watches me swallow it like he's monitoring a science experiment. I even had to open my mouth and lift up my tongue. Then he says something that makes my blood freeze. Funny thing. I found your allergy medication in the bathroom. And he holds up my prescription bottle. I looked up these pills, and the markings don't match Benadryl. They match vitamin C tablets. He continues, and his voice is so calm, it's terrifying. Also, you slept on that pillow with fur for hours with no reaction. And yesterday when you were napping, something else happened in our bed that should have sent you to the hospital. I literally can't breathe because he knows. They all know. But then he says, we Need to talk in the garage. All of us. Right now. I follow them like I'm walking to my execute. I open the door and immediately find a golden retriever puppy jumping on me, licking my entire face, fur absolutely everywhere. And my skin doesn't react. No hives, no sneezing, nothing. Instead, I scream bloody murder and trip trying to run away. My daughter starts crying, and grant says, quiet. Apparently, this dog slept in our bed yesterday. On your pillow. Actually, we have a video. That's when my son whispers, three months. We've had him three months. The dog brings me a tennis ball like we're best friends, and nobody knows what to say.

She dropped her bag with that familiar exhausted sound. Mike, eight months. You've been unemployed for eight months watching gamers play Fortnite? My mom keeps asking if you're depressed. I quickly switched tabs as she approached. Just keeping myself busy. Busy? You're watching someone build a virtual house. She saw my chat messages. Actively participating. This isn't a hobby anymore. It's an addiction. What she didn't see were the other tabs. Supplier emails from China, Shipping trackers, customer service responses. The Twitch streams were just background noise while I managed orders, adjusted Facebook ad campaigns, and negotiated with suppliers about delayed shipments. My sister's husband just bought a rental property, Sarah continued. Meanwhile, I'm telling people you're between opportunities.

She scrolled too far back and saw something odd. Delivery drivers. Dozens of them. Every single day. Mike, why are so many packages coming to our house? Her sister leaned in. Are you shopping addicts? Is that why you're broke? There returns, I said quickly. But Sarah kept scrolling. The packages were being picked up, not dropped off. Different drivers collecting them.

So I'm sitting in this courtroom wearing my grandfather's old blazer that smells like meatballs, and my neighbor's husband is pointing at me like I'm some kind of criminal mastermind. He's suing me for $25,000 because he claims my inherited parrot, Casanova, deliberately seduced his wife and destroyed their marriage. I'm not making this up. My parrot is apparently a homewrecker. The whole thing started when my grandfather passed away three months ago. We were really close. He basically raised me after my parents died. Every Sunday, I visit his apartment above the old barber shop he used to run back in the eighties. Grandpa found Casanova abandoned in a cardboard box behind his shop in 1987, right around when my grandmother left him. That bird became his whole world. Casanova Learned to talk from years of daytime TV and gossiping customers, getting perms. The bird would whistle at everything. The coffee maker, the mailman, Judge Judy on TV. He'd whistle the theme from jeopardy. Whenever I walked in, he'd walk, looking good, sweetheart. The exact way Grandpa used to greet grandma. When Grandpa died, I couldn't let Casanova go to some rescue, so I brought him to my apartment, set up his massive cage by the window where he could watch the street. I even played his favorite show, friends, on my laptop. The bird was grieving, too, you know? Everything went downhill when my neighbors, Vincent and Gina Were walking past my apartment window. Casanova was doing his usual routine, whistling at the plants, saying, hey there, hot stuff. Gina burst out laughing. She was doubled over, tears streaming down her face, telling Vincent, oh my god, that bird is so funny. Vincent smile dropped immediately. Step toward my window with his fists clenched, like he was about to swing at Casanova. A 45 year old man squaring up to fight a parrot. Gina had to pull him back, still giggling, which only made it worse. From that moment, Vincent became convinced this was a personal attack. He started stalking my parrot. I'm talking full surveillance mode. He installed a ring camera pointed at my window, bought some kind of parrot repellent on eBay. Even hired what he called a bird behaviorist, who turned out to be just some guy from Craigslist. Vincent

Maybe you should skip this trip. I said, fine, I'll skip it, and pulled out my phone to show them exactly what I've been contributing. Let me explain. My friends Nico, Chloe, and Sam had been planning this Miami trip for half a year. What they didn't know was that I'd secretly paid for everything three months ago. $3,200 for the beachfront Airbnb, $1,100 for the boat rental, $800 for V I P. Club tables, $600 for parasailing. They had supported me when I was broke and my dad had cancer, so I wanted to show how thankful I was. But I shouldn't have been that naive. We were already at the airport when Nico cornered me by the charging stations, Sam and Chloe flanking him. Arthur, we need to talk. Is this about the Uber? I said I'd pay you back. I offered, sensing something worse. It's about everything, Chloe said, loud enough for other passengers to start staring. I don't think you should accompany us on this trip. You're a leech. You never contribute anything to this group. What? I literally designed Nico's business logo for free. I even helped you move twice. Nico made air quotes with his hands. That doesn't count. Remember Vegas? You still owe me 50 bucks. Remember Josh's bachelor party? Sam had to cover your entire share. That was during my dad's chemo. I said quietly, I told you guys I was Broke. Because you always have an excuse. Chloe cut me off. Your dad, your freelance work, your car breaking down. We're exhausted being your personal ATM. I looked at Sam, desperately hoping for some support. Sam, come on. You know what I was dealing with. You saw the medical bills. Sam shrugged. Actually shrugged. Maybe you weren't ready to be part of a trip this expensive. We got you economy while we're in premium. That should tell you where you stand. I can afford. Can you really? Chloe pulled out her phone, scrolling through old Venmo requests. Six months of drinks we covered, four concerts where we spotted you. That Coachella trip where you mysteriously only brought $40. I paid you all back. I protested after we had to ask five times each. Nico said, look, Arthur, we're trying to have an adult vacation. Real money, real fun.

So I changed the locks and packed her things while she was at brunch. Twenty four hours later, she and her friends were blowing up my phone. The house is mine. Inherited from my grandparents. Mortgage paid off. I pay property taxes, utilities, insurance, everything. My girlfriend Hannah moved in about a year ago with no formal agreement because I loved her and thought we were building a future together. She pays for her car, phone, and it's groceries. That's it. No rent, no utilities. Her friends Olivia and Marie were constantly at our place, treating it like their personal hangout spot. They'd raid our fridge, leave messes, and Hannah always defended them with, they're practically family. When I suggested they hang out at their own apartment. Sometimes Hannah acted like I was being unreasonable. The breaking point came yesterday morning. Hannah walked into the kitchen, scrolling her phone, not even looking up when she dropped the bomb. Hey, so good news. Olivia and Marie are moving in. Moving in? What do you mean? Like, with their stuff? Their lease is up, so it's perfect timing. Where are they staying? We don't have spare rooms. Furnished. Take the two spare rooms. They're moving in rent free until they get back on their feet. Hannah, you can't decide your friends are moving into my house without talking to me. She sighed dramatically. Don't be Like that? It's a big house. They're practically family. Where are we supposed to sleep? She smiled that dismissive smile. Olivia and Marie can take the master bedroom. Since there are two of them, you can have a smaller room. Then she paused. Actually, you can just sleep on the couch. It's comfy. Sleep on the couch in my own house? The house

I convinced my entire high school I was colorblind for three years just to win a fifty dollar bet. It started in freshman biology when our teacher was droning on about genetic disorders. Jake Miller, cocky, rich, and always looking for entertainment, leaned over and whispered, I bet you couldn't fake being colorblind for a whole month without getting caught. I've never been able to resist a challenge. Especially from someone like Jake, who drove a BMW his daddy bought him while I worked weekends at Dairy Queen. Make it until graduation and you've got a deal, I whispered back. Fifty bucks says you crack in a month. He smirked, extending his hand. We shook on it right there between plastic models of DNA strands. That night I researched everything about red green color blindness. I Learned about Isihara tests, those dotted circles doctors use, how color blind people navigate traffic lights, and common mistakes they make. By morning, I had a game plan. Day one, I accidentally mixed up my red and green folders in front of our math teacher. Sorry, I mumbled, just loud enough for him to hear. They look the same to me. He paused mid equation. Thomas, are you colorblind? I feigned embarrassment, staring at my shoes. Yeah, I don't really talk about it. Words spread through the teacher's lounge like wildfire. By lunch, my history teacher was asking if I needed special accommodations for map activities. By the end of the week, the school counselor called me in to discuss my learning needs. I committed fully. I bought special colorblind glasses online that did absolutely nothing but look convincing, wearing them dramatically during school events and removing

The first text came around 4 p m. Hey, the key isn't working. Did you lock the deadbolt? I didn't answer. The call started escalating from different numbers. First Olivia, then Marie. By 6 p m, the tone shifted from annoyance to panic. What did you do? There's a storage receipt taped to the door. Are you kidding me? Apparently, they'd spent the night sleeping in the U Haul truck because they had nowhere else to go. When Hannah finally called, screaming about me being a psychopath, I calmly explained, I didn't throw anything out. Your belongings are safe and climate controlled storage. You were a guest who tried to move two other people in and relegate the homeowner to the couch. I just declined your terms. They tried everything. Police, welfare checks. So social media campaigns, lawsuit threats. When police came, I showed them Hannah's texts about me sleeping on the couch and doorbell footage of them screaming at my door. The officer sighed and said, so she tried to move friends in without permission, and now she's claiming you're unstable? I compiled screenshots of their defamatory posts, sent them to Hannah's tech company HR Department. I contacted their old property management company with evidence of their harassment from Marie, the aspiring influencer. I sent her smear campaign screenshots to every brand she'd tagged. Three weeks later, Hannah was fired for violating her company's social media policy. Olivia and Marie were blacklisted from reputable apartments. Marie's influencer dreams imploded when brand started blocking her. The quiet in my house feels like justice.

I found Mister Peterson loading equipment into his old station wagon. Get in, he said. We're going on a field trip. I hesitated. Is this allowed? He laughed. Probably not. Coming? We drove two hours to the coast. My confusion grew with every mile. Sir, what does the beach have to do with physics? He parked at a small airfield I'd never seen before. Everything has to do with physics, Morgan. A man greeted us with flight suits. That's when I realized Mister Peterson had arranged for us to go skydiving. Actual skydiving. This is completely insane, I protested, panic rising in my throat. You know what's insane? You're brilliant at understanding force and motion on the basketball court, but you can't translate it to paper. Today we're fixing that. During the plane ride up, instead of a safety briefing, he quizzed me. Calculate our terminal velocity, factor in wind resistance. What forces are at work when the parachute deploys? I was terrified, but answered each question, surprising myself when the concepts finally clicked. Good. He nodded.

What I saw will haunt me forever. I've been doing water rescue for eight years now, and most calls are body recovery, not rescue. People don't survive long in these freezing northern waters. But what I found last Tuesday has me ready to quit and never look back. The all came at 2 p m. When a father took his seven year old daughter, Emma, fishing at Crystal Lake. He turned away for 30 seconds to untangle his line. And when he looked back, she was gone. No splash, no scream. Just gone. I knew she was dead before we even arrived because the water temp was 42 degrees. Even if she could swim, hypothermia would kill her in minutes. But we had to try. My dive partner Jake and I searched the main area for three hours, but we found nothing. The current was brutal from recent storms. And that's when I noticed something odd. One of the old creek beds that had been dry for years was flowing again. And heavy rains must have opened it back up. I followed the creek and realized where it LED, which made my blood go cold. The dead zone. That's what the older divers called the deepest part of Crystal Lake. Hundred yard stretch where the water drops to over two hundred feet. We're strictly forbidden from diving there because unpredictable currents will kill you. They Always said. But the creek LED directly into the dead zone. So if Emma got swept into that current, her body would be down there. Jake was searching the other side of the lake, so I made a decision that still haunts me. I geared up and dropped into the forbidden waters alone. The first thing I noticed was how wrong the older divers were, because there was no current at all. The water was eerily still, like swimming in black suit. And I descended fifty feet, then a hundred, with nothing but darkness below. At 150 feet, my light finally hit something, and I thought it was seaweed at first. Long, pale strands swaying in the water. But as I got closer, I realized what I was really looking at. Arms. Hundreds of human arms, growing from the lake bottom like some twisted underwater forest. They were all different sizes, from tiny baby arms no bigger than my thumb, to adult arms thick as tree branches. All of them were pale green and moving slowly, grasping at the water around them. And they had roots spreading through the sediment, like they've been planted there.

I was 14 and I was walking through the mall when I saw a girl my age sitting alone at the arcade playing a racing game by herself. She looked really lonely, mashing buttons and talking to the screen like she had someone to compete with, making sound effects and celebrating when she won races against nobody. So I decided to go over and challenge her to try and make her day better. I walked up to her and asked if I wanted to race against her and I saw her face just completely change. Really? You really wanna play against me? I told her yes and I asked her which game she wanted to play so I could show her some moves. I knew she got excited and was about to pick a two player game, but then at the last second she stopped. She grabbed her backpack and said, the last time someone asked to play games with me and I let them use my quarters, they took all my money and left me standing there with nothing. My mom called me stupid and said stupid kids don't deserve more arcade money and I had to save up my allowance for three weeks just to come back here. I'm not stupid anymore and I'm not sharing. She turned around clutching her bag tight and my heart broke for her. I walked back over and Pinky promised her I wasn't going to take her money and told her I'd use my own quarters right next to her so I couldn't steal anything. I even showed her my wallet to prove I had my own money. She ended up agreeing to play, and when I showed her the combo moves, she was absolutely amazed. She yelled, that's so awesome! Teach me how to do that! She then started practicing really hard, and although she was messing up the timing at first, she seemed so focused and determined. I'll beat you, just you watch, she said with this fierce look in her eyes. And then after a full hour of trying and failing and trying again, she pulled off the combo perfectly. When she did, she was so thrilled she jumped up and down screaming and called me her awesome new gaming buddy. We took turns playing different games the rest of the afternoon, and she kept getting better and better at everything I taught her. When I told her I had to go home, she looked disappointed, but then asked me if I wanted to meet.

One day, my daughter came up to me and told me she didn't want to stay at daddy's house anymore. I had split custody with my ex, but this was the first time when she outright refused to visit him for her scheduled week. I sat down beside her and asked her what was going on. Did daddy do something to upset you? Then she told me how daddy's new girlfriend would make her do strange things and also made her promise not to tell anyone. When I asked what these things were, my heart dropped into my stomach. She would make my daughter sit in front of a laptop camera and answer personal questions about her body. Then she would record everything and tell her it was just a game. At first, my daughter thought it was normal, but she eventually realized that something felt wrong and became scared. So she asked her to stop. And my ex's girlfriend grabbed my daughter by the shoulders and shook her hard. She went to her daddy to complain and told him everything while sobbing. But instead of protecting her, he told her to stop making up stories. He was under the impression that I had coached our daughter to say this and simply refused to listen to her. I was so furious, but also heartbroken at the same time. The first thing I did was call the police, but the officer Who showed up was my ex's golf buddy, who basically laughed in my face. He told me the same thing that my ex said to our daughter. Stop making up drama just because you can't handle your ex moving on. I don't know what kind of father my ex husband was being that he didn't even consider the possibility of his girlfriend actually doing this. But I knew one thing, which was I couldn't just sit there and do nothing. I sent my daughter to my sister's house before taking action. I was a regular at this gym where I had made friends with these two guys who had done some questionable things in their past. Both of them agreed to help me with my plan.

I thought I hit the Jackpot when the Morrison family offered me $300 to babysit their daughter for one night. I had no idea this would be the last normal day of my life. The job seemed perfect. Rich neighborhood, well behaved kid, easy money. What could go wrong? Everything, apparently. When I arrived at their mansion on Elm Street, Missus Morrison answered the door, looking absolutely exhausted, dark circles under her eyes, hands shaking slightly as she spoke. Thank god you're here, Riley, she said, practically pulling me inside. We haven't had a night out in months. Mr. Morrison came downstairs carrying their seven year old daughter, Sophie. The little girl was adorable, with curly blonde hair and big blue eyes. But something felt off. She didn't smile when she saw me. She just stared. Before we leave, Miss, Missus Morrison said, handing me several folded papers. These are very important instructions. Please follow them exactly. Sophie's special. I nodded, stuffing the papers in my pocket without reading them. Big mistake. They left in a hurry, practically running to their car. I should have known something was wrong when they didn't even say goodbye to Sophie. The first few hours went great. Sophie and I watched cartoons, played board games, ate pizza. She was sweet and polite, nothing like the weird, difficult kids I usually dealt with. Around 7:30 she yawned and said she was getting Tired? What time is your bedtime? I asked. Mommy says I have to be in my room with the door locked by 8 p m, she said. Matter of factly locked? That seemed weird, but rich parents had strange rules sometimes. I figured I'd check the instructions once I got her settled. I tucked Sophie into her bed at 7:55. As I was leaving, she grabbed my arm. Don't forget to lock the door, whispered urgently. And whatever you hear tonight, don't come back in here. Promise me. Why would I need to? Promise me, she said, her grip tightening. Okay, okay. I promise. I closed her door and noticed the heavy duty lock installed on the outside. Not a regular bedroom lock. This was the kind they used in psychiatric hospitals. My hands were shaking as I turned the key. Downstairs, I finally pulled out Missus Morrison's instruction. What I read made my blood turn to ice.

I've been finding red lipstick on his collar for months, but he kept saying it was from work, meetings, handshakes, whatever. I even bought the same shade, trying to figure out where it came from, like some kind of detective. The whole time, it was right there, picking up my baby from school. I'm trying to keep my voice steady because Maya's still chattering away, completely innocent. How long has Miss Britney been picking you up, sweetheart? Maya starts counting on her fingers, tongue sticking out in concentration. Maybe two months. She's really nice and smells like flowers. Oh, and she always fixes daddy's hair before they kiss. Like this. She demonstrated by grabbing her own face and making exaggerated kissing sounds. Not a cheek peck, a real kiss. My seven year old was unknowingly describing my husband's affair in perfect detail. I had to excuse myself to the bathroom, where I sat on the toilet seat and cried for ten minutes, my whole body shaking. All those late nights, all those work emergencies. All those times he came home smelling different. And I'd actually

Three years ago, my wife Kathy was diagnosed with breast cancer. She fought for five years, but we never knew she was terminal until eight days before she passed. We were at the hospital for her regular chemotherapy when a nurse walked up and asked how she was feeling. Kathy smiled and said she was just tired. Then, without warning, the nurse asked what she wanted to do on her last few days. I stared at her. What are you talking about? The nurse's face dropped. Oh, I thought the doctor already told you. I broke down crying. The entire staff gathered around apologizing. But it didn't matter. We had just Learned the fight was over, and no one had told us. Two days before she passed, I was outside installing a new mailbox. Kathy came out and sat in a lawn chair watching me. The sun made her skin look less yellow, and I told her she was looking better. I wanted to believe she was getting better. That night, Kathy started vomiting constantly. By the morning, I told her we needed to go to the hospital. As I helped her get dressed, she was too weak to stand. I called my daughter over, and we decided to call an ambulance. I walked outside to wait. Then the front door burst open. Mom's not breathing. I ran inside. Kathy was sitting on the edge of the bed, eyes open, but she wasn't Breathing, I called 9 1 1, screaming for help. Paramedics arrived and rushed her to the hospital, while I followed behind and called her brother and sister. When I arrived, I begged to be with her, but they wouldn't let me back. The nurse told me they're doing the best they can. I begged her to ask the doctor if I could sit with her. A few minutes later, he returned and let me inside. The room was full of doctors and nurses fighting to bring her back. We have to make a decision. She's not going to make it. I broke down completely and we had to pull the plug. Everything stopped. Kathy was gone. I never got to say goodbye. I was outside waiting for the ambulance, but my stepdaughter told me Kathy's last words. I'm ready.

In fourth grade, a kid named Tyler walked up to me during recess and said, I'll give you five bucks if you pretend to be my twin brother for the whole day. I looked at him completely confused, because Tyler and I looked nothing alike. I had dark hair, he was blond. I wore glasses, he didn't. He was short, I was tall. But five bucks was five bucks, and I wasn't about to turn down free money. So I shrugged and said, deal. That's when I Learned he had already been telling everyone in our class that he had a secret twin who went to another school. Apparently, this started as a joke, but then people actually believed him. And instead of admitting he was lying, he doubled down. Now he needed me to prove it. The plan. Every time someone asked him something, I'd answer for him and vice versa. If a teacher called on him, I had to answer like I was also Tyler. If someone asked me a question, he'd respond like we were one person. It was the stupidest thing ever, but for some reason, people actually bought it. Then in gym class, things went very wrong. We were playing dodgeball when a teacher stopped the game and yelled, Tyler, why are you on both teams? I panicked. Tyler panicked. We both just stood there staring at her, waiting for the other to say something. Then Tyler grabbed his knee, fell over and yelled, Mrs. Davis, I think I'm seeing double. She genuinely looked concerned. She walked us both to the nurse's office, where Tyler kept acting dizzy, saying he felt weird, like there were two of him. We sat there for twenty minutes while the nurse gave him crackers and told him to breathe slowly. By the end of the day, he so committed to the bit that he even wrote my name on his homework and tried to turn it in. The next morning, he handed me a single dollar Bill and said, sorry, I only have this. But you were the best fake twin ever. I never got the rest of my money. Most importantly, Sophie has been dead for three years. What's in that room is something else. Something that found her body and decided to wear it. We can't get rid of it, so we contain it. We've been looking for someone young and healthy, too. Well, you'll understand soon enough. The doors are locked from the outside. There's no cell service here, no landline. You can't leave. We're sorry, but Sophie needs to feed, and we can't do this anymore. Good luck. The Morrisons. P S. If you're reading this,

Something was waiting for us. It was ten thirty one PM when my phone buzzed with an emergency alert that said do not enter underground structures such as basements. Stay above ground until they all clear. My husband Mark looked up from his own phone and we stared at each other, both having received the same message. What do you think's going on? I asked, glancing toward our basement door. Our five year old daughter, Emma had been asleep for an hour upstairs. Could be a gas leak or radar issue, Mark replied, but his voice sounded uncertain. I ran upstairs to check on Emma, who was sleeping peacefully in her bed, then came back down to find Mark staring at the TV. The local news channel was displaying the same emergency alert in blocky white letters on a black screen, but when he flipped to CNN and other networks, there was nothing about any emergency in our area. I pulled out my phone and searched Google for any news about the alert, but nothing came up. I texted Sarah, a neighbor from two streets over, asking if she'd gotten the same message. No response. I think we should leave, I said, grabbing a duffel bag from the closet. We can go to my sister's place until this clears up. But Emma has school tomorrow and I have work, Mark protested. Don't you work from home on Mondays, anyway? I replied, already packing clothes and Emma's favorite stuffed animals into the bag. While Mark hesitated, I walked over to our basement door and noticed the chain lock was latched. I hurried to the kitchen, grabbed some duct tape, and started sealing the cracks around the basement door. What are you doing? Mark asked. If it's some kind of gas leak, I don't want it getting into the rest of the house, I said, pulling another strip of tape across the bottom gap. Within 10 minutes, I had packed our essentials and was ready to leave. Mark finally agreed to wake Emma, and we carried her out to the car. Wrapped in blankets. She stirred sleepily, but didn't fully wake up as I strapped her into her car seat. As we pulled out of our driveway, I noticed how quiet the neighborhood was. If everyone had gotten the same alert, wouldn't more people be leaving? The houses on our street were all dark except for automatic porch lights, and there were no other cars on the road.

Here's what this jerk didn't know. Emma had been telling us all week how nervous she was about proving herself to her Family. How she wanted to earn every promotion, every bit of respect. How she was terrified people would think she only got opportunities because of her last name. She'd been working at McDonald's. She was 16, sending half her paychecks home to help her mom pay rent after her dad left them with nothing but debt.

Mom cried about the neighbors. Their ultimatum. Break up with Thea and give the baby up or never come home. I chose Thea. We lived in my car for two months, then a friend's basement. Those first weeks were hell. Thea had morning sickness so bad she couldn't keep anything down. I'd hold her hair back in gas station bathrooms, both of us crying. I remember one night in November, the car windows fog up from our breathing. Thea was shivering despite three blankets. She whispered, maybe your parents were right. Maybe we're too young for this. I held her tighter and said, no, we're going to prove them wrong. But honestly, I was terrified. I'd wake up at three a m. In panic attacks, wondering how we'd afford formula or doctor visits. Thea would rub my back and remind me we had each other. The worst part was driving past my house for school. I'd see mom watering her flowers, dad washing his car. Normal life continuing like I'd never existed. Thea caught me staring once and just squeezed my hand. They don't deserve you, she said. But I still missed them every single day. Her parents weren't thrilled either, but they never abandoned her. Mom Delfine started buying prenatal vitamins and baby clothes. Her dad taught me basic car maintenance so I wouldn't get stranded. Family sticks together, Delfine told me one night. Blood or not, that hit different when my own blood relatives had written me off. Christmas was the hardest. Thea's family invited me.

I've been working at this upscale steakhouse called the Prime Cut for almost four years now, and I've seen more first dates than I can count. Most blend together in my memory, but there was one last Tuesday that I'll never forget. The evening rush hadn't started yet when this woman walked in. Late 20s, wearing a sundress that still had the tags tucked in, clutching a small wrapped gift that looked like it came from the bookstore next door. She was 50 minutes early for her reservation and asked for a specific spot at the bar that she requested when booking. As I set up her area, I noticed her hands trembling slightly as she placed the gift on the empty stool beside her. She kept checking her reflection in the mirror behind the bar, are adjusting her earrings and practicing what looked like conversation starters under her breath. So how was your drive over? She whispered to herself, then shook her head and tried again. Is this your first time at the prime cut? The nervousness was radiating off her in waves. For those 15 minutes, she just sat there nursing a Diet Coke, rearranging her purse, and checking her phone every two minutes. Our manager even asked if everything was okay, and she assured us her date was coming at 7:00. When he finally arrived, the contrast was immediate. He was polished, expensive watch, tailored jacket. But He barely acknowledged her as he slid onto the stool. Before she could even hand him the gift, he pulled out his phone and started scrolling, saying, sorry. Client stuff. You know how it is. The woman's face fell for a split second before she plastered on a smile and gently placed the gift on the bar between them. I brought them water and took their drink orders. A simple wine spritzer for her, a specific brand of Bourbon with exactly two ice cubes, not crushed, for him. When I returned with their drinks, he was still glued to his phone. She was desperately trying to connect, asking about his work, his weekend plans, his thoughts on the restaurant, while he gave one word answers without looking up.

I just found my boyfriend's name on a murder list. I moved into apartment 42 with my boyfriend Marcus three days ago. We've been together for five years and finally saved enough to leave our parents houses. He's 24, I'm 22. And this was supposed to be our fresh start together. The apartment was way too good for our budget. Two bedrooms, city part views, balcony deposit free with a five year lease option. The landlord said no inspections, no questions asked. It felt too good to be true, but we were desperate. On our first morning, I found a handwritten note in the kitchen cupboard. Beautiful cursive writing that said new occupier of apartment 42 on the outside. Inside was a 12 rule survival guide from the previous tenant. Missus Prudence Hemmings, who lived here 35 years before her husband died in some kind of incident. Rule seemed insane at first. Never use the elevator between 1:11 and 3:00am. Ignore the window cleaner who appears on the balcony. Don't talk to neighbors claiming to live in apartment 65 to 72 because those burned down in the 80s and everyone died. Keep weapons in every room. Don't babysit Terry's kids from Apartment 26. I thought it was some sick joke until everything started happening exactly as described. At 11:00am, a friendly window cleaner knocked on our balcony door on the seventh floor. He exactly 30 minutes tapping and Calling out, never breaking eye contact through the glass. When he left, I checked every balcony in the building. He vanished completely. That afternoon, I heard the animal noises from apartment 48. Not dog barking or cat meowing. Something else. Something that sounded like it was in pain. Dying slowly, over and over again. At 8:00am the next morning, the postman, Ian, knocked. When I opened the door, he looked at me with sad eyes and said, missus Hemmings left something for you, didn't she? I'm sorry about what's coming. What do you mean? I asked. The rules aren't suggestions, he whispered. They're the only thing keeping you alive. This building feeds on people who don't follow them. That's when I noticed the damp patch on our bedroom ceiling had turned deep red overnight. Not rust or water damage. It looked like blood pooling and spreading, but never dripping. Marcus had been acting strange since we moved in. Distant, jumpy, checking the time constantly. Yesterday, he kept muttering about his early shift, saying he had to leave at 3:15.

I grew up speaking it at home, but rarely mentioned it since moving to the city. Why would I? Every weekend, like clockwork, I'd hear Heidi and her friends laughing.

And walking through our hallway with bags. God, how pathetic is that? The worst was when my mom came to visit. We were speaking German in the elevator when Heidi got in. Mom was mid sentence about her garden back home when Heidi's eyes widened with recognition at the language. She stared at the floor numbers like they were the most fascinating thing she'd ever first Seen.

For the next two miles he's weaving through traffic like he's in fast and furious, cutting people off, running yellow lights, the whole nine yards. I'm just maintaining my normal speed, watching this lunatic endanger everyone on the road. Then I see the construction zone ahead, single lane flaggers controlling traffic, and a long line of cars already stopped. Mister Road Rage doesn't notice until the last second. He slams on his brakes, but he's going way too fast. His truck starts skidding on the morning dew and He slides right past the stopped cars into the construction zone. I pull up safely behind the last car in line and watch through my windshield as this guy's truck gets stuck in wet concrete that the crew was pouring for a new sidewalk. The construction workers are yelling and waving their arms as his rear wheels spin uselessly and what's probably $1,000 worth of concrete mix. But wait, it gets better.

I always thought my older sister was overprotective. Growing up, she'd walk me to school even though her high school was in the opposite direction. She checked my homework, packed my lunches, and always asked who I was hanging out with. It drove me crazy. When I was 13, I wanted to go to my first concert with friends. No parents, just us. She insisted on coming along, sitting rose behind us like some kind of shadow. I remember the burning embarrassment when my friend spotted her. I didn't speak to her for days afterward. In high school, she somehow always knew when I was hanging out with Ryan, this guy she thought was trouble. She'd conveniently need to pick me up early or would show up with some urgent reason. One night, she literally pulled me out of a party where there was drinking. Screamed at her in the car that she was ruining my life. She just gripped the steering wheel tighter and said, hate me now if you need to. When I moved away for college, she'd call every Sunday without fail. She'd ask about my classes, if I was eating right, did I need money for books. I'd rush through these calls, annoyed at her constant hovering. Sometimes I'd accidentally miss her calls, texting later with flimsy excuses. For my 21st birthday, she surprised me by flying cross country. I had plans with friends that Weekend. But she'd already booked us tickets to this play I'd mentioned once months before. I reluctantly canceled my parties. She seemed so happy during that weekend that I couldn't bring myself to tell her how much her visit had disrupted my life. Last year she planned this huge family reunion for our parents anniversary. I complained the whole time about taking

My heart drops because my six year old has zero filter. I rush over there thinking she cursed or something. Nope, way worse. This. Walsh sits me down and says, Zoe told the class that mommy and daddy wrestle really loud at night, and it keeps her awake. I'm like, excuse me, what now? She continues, she said, you guys slam into walls and make the house shake. Other kids were asking questions. Some parents have already called asking if everything's okay at home. Oh, my god.

I'm sitting there trying to process this nightmare when missus Walsh adds, Zoe also mentioned loud thumping sounds and you both breathing really heavy.

I've been living with Jake for eight months when I started noticing my adderall running out faster than it should. At first, I thought maybe I was taking extra doses during final stress, but the numbers weren't adding up. I'm prescribed 30 pills per month, one daily, but by day 20, I'd only have five pills left. This happened three months in a row. Jake was the obvious suspect. He had access to my room where I kept my medication, and had been acting weird. New clothes, expensive dinners, always had cash when he used to be broke. Must be miscounting, he'd say when I mentioned running out early. ADHD brains, right? The thing is, I'm a pharmacy student. Tracking medication is literally what I do. For my senior thesis, I was researching prescription drug diversion, so I've been documenting everything. I decided to set a trap. I bought a small spy camera from Amazon and hid it in my bookshelf, aimed at my desk, where I kept my medication. Then I marked each pill bottle with a tiny dot and photographed every pill from multiple angles. I also started a spreadsheet tracking the exact number of pills, their characteristics, and when I took them. If Jake was stealing, I'd have proof. Three days later, I reviewed the camera footage. There was Jake, 2 p m. On Tuesday, going through my desk while I was in class. He opened my prescription Bottle shook out several pills and put them in his pocket, but I wanted to catch him in the act and see how deep this went. I checked our university's anonymous tip form where students buy and sell things. Sure enough, there was a post from username Jake M94 selling study aids for $20 each. The post had dozens of responses from desperate students looking for Adderall during midterms. I created a fake account and message Jake's username pretending to be a freshman needing study help. Hey, I heard you have study aids available. My roommate mentioned you might have adderall. Yeah, I got the good stuff. Prescription grade, $20 per pill. Meet at the library. He was selling my medication for $20 per pill. Pills that cost me $5.

She turns every single event into her personal drama show. My graduation. Fought with the parking guy for 20 minutes. Desi's baby shower. Complain the decorations were too pink for two hours straight. But it goes deeper than that. Growing up, I was always walking on eggshells around her. He promised to come to my school plays, then show up drunk and make a scene in the lobby. When I got accepted to college, instead of celebrating, she spent the whole dinner complaining about how expensive it would be and how I was abandoning the family. The worst part? She genuinely thinks she's being helpful. In her mind, she's the victim in every situation, just trying to look out for everyone. But really, she sucks the joy out of everything because she can't stand not being the center of attention. I knew she'd find something wrong with my wedding. The flowers, the music, my dress. Nothing would be good enough. Plus, she kept hinting about giving a speech, about how she raised me right despite dumping me with grandma for three years when I was 12 because she needed to find herself. The final straw came during dress shopping. I found this beautiful, simple dress that made me feel like myself. My mom took one look and said, what? Well, I guess if you want to look plain on your wedding day, that's your choice then. She spent an hour trying to convince the shop owner to show me something with more personality and more figure. Flattering. I cried in the fitting room that day. Not happy tears. Frustrated, exhausted tears. I realized I was already dreading my own wedding because of her.

What's the most absurd emergency you've responded to? We received a dispatch from a hysterical father, shouting and sobbing. My daughter is in critical condition. Please hurry. She has a 115 degree fever. We exchanged glances, thinking, that's not a fever, that's cremation. If this girl's temperature was actually 115, she'd be cooking from the inside. We sped to the residence, like rushing to deliver triplets. Upon arrival, the dad was frantically pacing as if his world was ending. She's upstairs, burning up, won't respond. We charged up the staircase, prepared for severe intervention. When we opened the bedroom door, there she was. Crawled across her bed, pretending to be unconscious, whimpering. My insides are on fire! My bones feel like they're disintegrating. She appeared to be auditioning for a de less drama. As we moved to check her vitals, I noticed a washcloth soaking in scalding water, still limiting steam. I glanced back at her. She froze, eyes wide with panic. We didn't need to take her temperature. I turned to the father. Sir, she's completely fine. He squinted. What do you mean? She fabricated the whole situation. He looked at the steaming cloth, then at his daughter, and visibly deflated. Are you serious? The girl started scrambling. I didn't intend to. I just didn't prepare for my history presentation. Dead silence followed. Then he erupted. You summon paramedics over a school presentation? She attempted justification. I thought I'd get an F. He faced us. You're free to Go. Thanks. As we departed, he slammed her door. We heard objects crashing, yelling, and him declaring, your re. You're grounded till college. Just as we reached our ambulance, he hustled her outside, shoved her into their car, and sped towards school to make her do the conviction overturn. I sued the state for wrongful imprisonment. Use the money to become a criminal defense attorney specializing in cases involving prosecutorial misconduct. Trevor got out last year. Works at a gas station now. Sometimes I drive by just to see how far he's fallen. From governor candidate to night shift attendant. The Maxwells thought they could bury the truth forever. Instead, they just delayed it until the moment it would hurt the most.

One day, this 19 year old kid walks in wearing designer everything, waving around a credit card his daddy gave him. He demanded to skip the basic training and go straight to advanced jumps because he'd played a lot of video games. When I refused, he pulled out his phone and showed me his social media. He had two million followers and made videos doing dangerous stunts. He threatened to post about how our school was refusing service to famous influencers unless we let him skip the basics. My boss, worried about bad publicity, asked me to give him a chance. The kid signed every waiver with a smirk, bragging about how he'd probably teach me some new tricks. He wouldn't stop talking about his parkour videos and how skydiving would be easy mode for someone like him. During the ground training, he kept interrupting me to explain how he'd seen it done differently on YouTube. When I tried to show him proper parachute handling, he rolled his eyes and said, I've watched literally every skydiving video on the internet. Morning of his first jump, he showed up hungover. I told him we'd have to reschedule, but he threatened to sue us for discrimination. He live streamed himself getting into the plane, telling his followers he was about to show this old instructor how it's really done at

This foam swan is sitting there looking more elegant than I've ever looked in my entire life. I'm genuinely appreciative. So I say, oh, wow, that's really cool. Thanks. And Luna's face just drops like, I told her my dog died. She blinks twice and goes, cool. I pause mid Sip? Yeah, it's. It's really well done. She crosses her arms. I spent six years perfecting latte art. This isn't cool. This is craft. Ma'am, I said it was cool because I think it's impressive. That's. That's a compliment. But Luna's not having it. She turns to her coworker, guy with a mustache that definitely has its own Instagram account, and goes, he called my swan cool. Mustache.

I kept getting these annoying prank calls from someone pretending to be conducting fake surveys about random stuff. Like, hello, sir, we're conducting a survey about how many socks you own. Or, ma'am, what's your opinion on purple vegetables? After the third call, I was getting pretty annoyed, but then I had a brilliant idea. The next time they called, I was ready. They started with their usual routine. Hello, we're conducting a survey about kitchen appliances. I immediately cut them off and said, oh, perfect timing. I'm actually conducting a survey about prank calling habit. There was a confused pause, and they said, excuse me. What? I said, since you're clearly a prank caller, this is a great opportunity to gather research data. Can you please rate your prank calling technique on a scale of 1 to ten? I tried to deny it, but I pressed on with complete seriousness. Sir, this is for scientific research purposes. I need to document various prank calling methodologies. Now, would you describe your approach as amateur or professional level? The caller was clearly thrown off and actually started answering my questions. They said, well, I guess I'm pretty good at it. Excellent. I said, now can you demonstrate your range of fake voices for my study? They actually started doing different accents like they were auditioning for a voice acting role. I took detailed notes and said, fascinating. Now tell Me. What inspired you to get into prank calling? They spent five minutes explaining how they started prank calling as a hobby in middle school. Very interesting. Now, for research purposes, can you rank your top three prank call? Top. They enthusiastically listed fake surveys, wrong numbers, and pizza delivery pranks. I said, excellent data. Now I need you to demonstrate each technique with a brief example. This person actually started performing different prank call scenarios while I pretended to take scientific notes. 20 minutes into this fake interview, I said, now I need you to rate your own performance today. They said, honestly, this might be my best work. I really felt like I connected with my subject. that's interesting, because technically, you just got reverse prank called. There was dead silence, and I could hear them processing what just happened. They said, wait, you're not actually conducting research? I said, nope, but congratulations.

My parents had this annoying habit of shutting down every request I made with the same exact phrase. When you pay rent, you can make the rules. Didn't matter what I asked for your bedtime, different dinner, friends over on weekdays, the answer was always the same. When you pay rent, you can make the rules. I was 14 and getting sick of hearing it, so I decided to take them literally. I started saving. Every birthday dollar, every allowance payment, every lawn mowing job. For three months, I hoarded money like I was planning to buy a car. My parents thought I was being responsible. Little did they know, I was plotting their destruction. I looked up our monthly rent online. Turns out we paid one 2 hundred dollars a month. I counted my savings and had exactly one 2:47 perfect. One Tuesday morning, I walked into the kitchen where my parents were drinking coffee and reading the news. I slammed a stack of cash on the table and said, here's this month's rent payment. My dad nearly choked on his coffee, and my mom just stared at the money. What is this for? I said, well, you always told me when I pay rent, I can make the rules, so I'm paying rent. My dad tried to hand the money back, but I stepped away from the table. Nope. A deal's a deal. I'm Officially a rent paying tenant now. My mom said, honey, we didn't mean it literally. I said, too late. The transaction is complete and as the new co landlord, I'm implementing some house rules. I pulled out a typed list I prepared and started reading my new regulations. Rule No. 1 mandatory family dance time every night at seven PM. No exceptions. Rule No. 2 pizza only Tuesday. We're ordering pizza every Tuesday from now on. Rule number three no news during breakfast. Only cartoons are allowed on the TV. My parents looked at each other like I'd lost my mind. My dad said, this is ridiculous. You can't. I just pay rent and take over the house. I said, actually, according to your own logic, I can. You've been telling me for years that rent equals rule making power. My mom tried reasoning with me. Sweetie, we'll give you the money back. Just stop this. I shook my head. Sorry, but I've already invested in this household. As a paying tenant, I have rights. That night at seven PM, I turned on music and announced it was mandatory family.

I'm at McDonald's at 2:00am. Not because I have my life together, but because I was up gooning to productivity videos and realized I hadn't eaten anything except sadness and energy drinks for 12 hours. I pull up to the drive through speaker and this voice comes through. Sound like it's been filtered through three layers of defeat and a broken dreams machine. What you want? Not welcome to McDonald's or how can I help you? Just pure, pure existential exhaustion in four words. So I respond the way my mom raised me. Good evening. Could I please get a Big Mac meal with a Coke? Thank you so much. Silence. Dead silence. Like I just spoke ancient Latin. What? A Big Mac meal, please, with a Coke. Thank you. More silence then. Why are you talking like that? I blink. Like what? All fancy and stuff. You making fun of me? No, I'm just ordering food. Nobody talks that polite at 2:00am. You being sarcastic? Ma'am, I said please and thank you. That's not sarcasm. That's basic human decency. But she's not having it. Hold on. I sit there for five minutes wondering if being raised with manners is now considered a hate crime. She comes back. My manager wants to talk to you. A new voice appears. Male, tired. Sounds like he's been managing teenagers since the Clinton administration. Sir, my employee says you're being Disrespectful? I said please and thank you. Right, but the way you said it was condescending. I'm getting accused of weaponizing politeness, like I'm some kind of manners terrorist. I was just trying to be nice. I explained. See, that's the problem. Nobody's that nice at 2:00am unless they're up to something. Up to something? I'm up to diabetes and poor life choices. That's what 2:00am McDonald's is for. Sir, I just want a burger. And I just want customers who don't mock my staff with fake politeness. Fake politeness? I've been accused of many things, but never artificial courtesy. How would you like me to order? I ask normal, like everyone else. What does normal sound like? Just say what you want. No fancy words. So I try again. Big Mac meal. Coke. Better, but lose the attitude. What attitude?

My Jewish family had a tradition called the debt book. Every child born into our family got their own Ledger on their first birthday. Every expense, diapers, food, clothes, school supplies, medical bills got logged with interest. On your 18th birthday, you were presented with your total debt. Mine was $247,000. Family takes care of family, my father would say. But family also pays family back. The tradition went back four generations. My great grandfather started it during the depression, supposedly to teach financial responsibility. Every adult child paid their parents back in monthly installments. Some took decades to clear their debt. My older brother Jake signed his repayment contract at 18, dropped out of college to work construction. 10 years later, still paying. My sister Maria became a nurse specifically because medical professionals pay off debt faster. When my 18th birthday approached, I did something nobody had ever done. I research. Found out child support is a parent's legal obligation. Not alone discovered that charging your children for their upbringing might actually be illegal. Learned that financial abuse is a real thing. The night of my birthday party, the whole extended family gathered. 50 relatives waiting to witness another debt book signing. My parents presented my Ledger like it was an honor. Two hundred forty seven thousand, one hundred eighty two dollars and sixty three cents. My father announced, very reasonable, Uncle Rob

My cousin Tommy weighed nearly 300 pounds by eighth grade. Kids at school were brutal about it, but at family gatherings, we never mentioned his size. He was just Tommy, the gentle giant who helped grandma pull weeds, always let the younger cousins win at board games, and laughed like a foghorn when something genuinely made him happy. He was everyone's favourite. Every Friday night, our entire family would gather at my aunt's house for dinner. That night, like always, Tommy was sitting cross legged on the floor playing Mario Kart with my little brother, while whiskers, our 17 year old family cat, slept in his usual warm spot near the sliding glass door. Whiskers was ancient. He had survived two house moves, four new babies, and more toddler tailpulls than any living creature should have to endure. We all joked he'd outlive us. Out of nowhere, my little brother came racing in with his new remote control car, zigzagging through the living room like a maniac, showing off to everyone. The car flew right under Tommy's legs. Just as he started getting up to grab a second plate of pizza, his foot caught on the corner of the carpet. He lost his balance. I watched it all in slow motion. His arms flailed his face, and then came the soft, dull crunch when he landed. Most people didn't even hear it, but I did. Whiskers didn't move. He didn't hiss. He Didn't cry. Just silent. The whole room froze. Tommy stayed on the floor, pale as a ghost, whispering no over and over while his eyes filled with tears. My dad crossed the room and gently picked up whiskers, wrapping him in the fleece blanket from the recliner, the one whiskers always curled up on. My mom quietly ushered the rest of us into the kitchen. From behind the doorway, I could see Tommy sitting there, shoulders heaving as he sobbed. My aunt knelt beside him, rubbing his back and trying to hold it together. But even she looked shattered. That blanket never came back. By the time we left that night, every trace of whiskers was gone. His toys, his bed, the food and water bowls by the fridge. It was like someone hit delete on his whole existence. We never talked about it again. No one.

You, he says, pointing directly at my soul office. Now I look around, confused. Me? What did I do? Don't play dumb, sir. I'm not playing anything. This is just my face. So I follow him to his office, and he pulls out a test paper. But here's the thing. It's not from his class. It's from AP Physics. You Know, the class I've never taken, would never take, and couldn't pass if my life depended on it? He slides it across the desk. Explain this. I stare at the paper. It's got my name on it. Well, technically, it says M. Johnson, but we have the same last name, same first initial. And the handwriting looks exactly like mine. Because it's Marcus's handwriting. Because we're twins. Because genetics is a thing. Mr. Rodriguez, I say slowly, I don't take physics. Leans back in his chair like he just caught me in the lie of the century. Really? Then how do you explain getting a perfect score on yesterday's quantum mechanics exam? I blink. I don't even know what quantum mechanics means. I thought it was a type of car repair. He's not buying it. He pulls out another paper. This one's from AP Calculus. Also signed M. Johnson. Also, my brother's identical.

I could hear him yelling about property rights and respect for boundaries at an eight year old. I ran outside and told Logan to back off. Zoe was crying and ran inside. I explained that kids sometimes chase balls. It's not a big deal, and asked him to not yell at my daughter. Logan got up in my face and said, your little brat needs to Learn boundaries. This is my property, and I don't want her stepping foot on it ever again. I told him she was just getting her ball and would be more careful, but he wasn't having it.

It's him hugging a young man in a cap and gown. He went to the graduation and his grandson ran up and hugged him the moment he saw him. His daughter in law had been hoping he'd come for year.

We'd been together for five years, and everything seemed perfect. Emma was this sweet, caring person who worked as a nurse and made these incredible Sunday morning pancakes. She had this one weird thing, though. She was absolutely terrified of bugs. Like, completely loses her mind terrified. I knew about it from pretty early on. She'd see a spider in the bathroom and start hyperventilating. One time, she saw a roach in our apartment and locked herself in the bedroom for three hours until I could get rid of it. I always thought it was kind of endearing in a weird way. Like, everyone has their thing, right? We were at my buddy Tyler's house having one of those perfect summer nights. You know the kind sitting on the back deck, roasting marshmallows over this little fire pit, drinking beers, just talking about nothing important. Emma was laughing at some stupid story Tyler's girlfriend was telling about her coworker. That's literally the last thing I remember from that night. I woke up in the hospital with the worst headache of my life and Emma crying next to my bed. My forehead felt like someone had taken a blow torch to it. And there were all these wires and beeping machines everywhere. Emma's mascara was running down her face, and she kept saying, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, over and over. The doctor came In and explained what happened. Apparently, there was a spider on my forehead. Just a regular house spider, nothing dangerous. Emma saw it and completely lost it.

But my parents gave our tickets to my cousin instead. What they didn't know is that I work there. My brother Isaac, has cerebral palsy, and he's been obsessed with Disney since he was five. Mickey Mouse ears, Toy Story marathons, the whole deal. For his 18th birthday, I wanted to do something special. Eight months of saving every penny from my retail job at target, skipping movies, eating ramen, working double shifts on weekends, all to surprise him with a week at Disney World. I planned everything perfectly. Fast passes for all his favorite rides, character breakfast at Chef Mickey's, dinner at Be Our Guest. I even got us matching let's light your shirts because Toy Story is his absolute favorite. The look on his face when I told him was worth every hour I worked. He started crossing off days on his calendar with a red marker. Two days before we're supposed to leave, mom calls me while I'm folding laundry. Change of plans, honey. Your cousin Savannah is going instead. I almost dropped the phone. What do you mean Savannah is going? Isaac wouldn't appreciate it anyway. Too many crowds, too much walking. You know how he gets overwhelmed. I'm speechless. Savannah is my aunt's daughter. The golden child who gets everything handed to her. New car for her 16th Europe trip for graduation, full college tuition paid. She's never worked a day in her life, but Mom, I planned this specific quickly for Isaac. I saved for eight months. She sighs. Like I'm being dramatic. Savannah just got into college. She deserves a Celebration trip. Besides, Isaac can watch the Disney Channel. He'll be just as happy. My heart breaks. Isaac had been practicing his autograph book, asking me which characters we'd meet first. What about all the accessibility planning I did? The wheelchair rental, the special dietary requests? Savannah doesn't need that stuff. She'll actually enjoy the rides. That stung like Isaac's happiness didn't matter because it looked different. What? My parents didn't know. I've been working at Disney World as a character performer for the past year. Weekend shifts, playing Buzz Lightyear at meet and greets. I kept it.

It started with phone cases. My three best friends and I, Maya, Liam and Chloe, decided to start a small online shop. We'd spend weekends in my garage hand painting cool designs and bringing them out. We were a team. We even opened a shared bank account just for the business. The rule was simple. All the money goes in, and we only use it for supplies. For a while, it was perfect. We were actually making a profit. But then weird things started happening. Ten dollars vanished, then twenty. We'd all look at the account confused. We blamed it on bank fees, maybe a miscalculation. But when a fifty dollar transaction appeared that no one could explain, the mood shifted. We had a meeting in the garage, but it felt more like an interrogation. Liam got super defensive, which made him look guilty. Maya was so quiet, she seemed like she was hiding something. And Chloe just kept trying to nervously make peace. The trust was gone. Every sale notification, instead of being exciting, just made my stomach tighten. We weren't a team anymore. We were just four people sitting in a room full of paint fumes, wondering who the thief was. I couldn't sleep, so I ended up telling my mom everything. She's an accountant and her brain just works differently. She saw how torn up I was and said, Let's stop guessing and start looking.

In my 15 years working at maximum security, I met thousands of inmates, but none like Omar. He was serving 25 years for shooting someone during a robbery gone wrong. The thing is, he wasn't the shooter. His brother was. Omar took the fall because his brother had three young kids. The first time I saw Omar, he was teaching another inmate how to read in the library. Not unusual, except this was at 3 a m. See, Omar had worked out a deal with the night guards. He'd help clean the cafeteria after hours in exchange for using the library to tutor guys who were too embarrassed to be seen learning during the day. I remember asking him why he bothered. Looked at me and said, everyone deserves a chance to write letters home to their mama. Simple as that. What really got me was how he handled the gang stuff. We had major problems with rival groups, but Omar somehow stayed neutral. One day, two gangs were about to go at it in the yard. Omar walked right between them, pulled out a chessboard and challenged both leaders to a game. Said whoever won would get his dessert portions for a month. These tough guys, covered in tattoos, actually sat down and played. By the time they finished, they'd forgotten what they were fighting about. Omar lost his pudding cups.

One. That as their father, I could change their names whenever I wanted to. One time I pretended to get on the phone with the Arizona Name Registry, renamed my two kids snorkel and gorf because they kept misbehaving. They were bawling. I could barely keep a straight face. Two. I was on a flight where a kid saw the button for calling. A flight attendant didn't know what it was, but clearly was thinking about pressing it, and so asked his dad what it did. His dad said it opens a trap door under your seat and drops you out of the bottom of the plane. Afterwards, the kids spent the whole flight intrigued by the button, thinking about and talking about pushing it, but too worried to actually do it. 3. Not exactly a lie, but when I was first learning swear words, my parents made the mistake of telling me those were words only mommies and daddies are allowed to say. So I was playing house with my sister and her friends, and I was the dad. I promptly went on a swearing tirade as the dad and got in big trouble. Four. When we were in the car and it was raining, my mom would wait for a bridge or tunnel, and as we approached it, she would tell us she was going to make the rain stop in 3:21. She told us she could only make the Rain stop for a minute because it made her so tired. My siblings and I were convinced she was magic.

She was so small, this tiny four year old with tears streaming down her face, left arm wrapped in gauze, clutching a stuffed elephant someone had given her. When she saw me walk in with my briefcase still in hand, she did something that changed everything. Daddy, it hurts. He'd never called me daddy before. It was always Jordan or him when she talked to her mom about me. But there she was, reaching her good arm toward me, like I was the only person in the world who could fix this. I dropped everything. Literally. Briefcase hit the floor, phone went silent, and I just held her. She buried her face in my expensive suit and cried while I whispered, it's okay, baby girl. Over and over. The nurse came in with discharge papers and a bright yellow cast. Ava looked up at me with these huge brown eyes and asked if I could stay with her that night because her arm felt scary. I called Katie. She was stuck at work and couldn't get there until morning. For the first time in four years, I said yes without checking my calendar first.

I got banned from all school events for switching out all the interview questions at a beauty pageant. Thirty minutes before showtime, my best friend Carmen looked at me through the curtains, her face full of panic. I grinned at her and put two thumbs up, whispering, okay, let the show begin. The lights dimmed and the host on stage shouted, and now for the question and answer portion of the show. Let's bring out our top five contestants. Finally, my best friend Carmen didn't think she'd make it this far, but I knew she was kind and beautiful and deserved it way more than the bratty. Harper greeted us with a typical mean girl line every morning at school. Hi, losers! I held my breath as they called Carmen to the front, along with Harbor and three other girls who looked just as nervous. Harbor looked confident, but she wouldn't be soon, not with what I did behind the scenes. The host called Harbor first. Judge fished a question from the bowl while she stood there in her designer dress and perfect posture. Who is your role model and why? She started strong? The three pillars of leadership that have guided my journey are. Then she froze. Her eyes went wide. That wasn't the question she was looking for. She tried to recover, but by then the timer had run out. The host tried to push her to the Side to call up another girl, but stood there malfunctioning like a robot. These aren't the right questions, she finally snapped at the judges. The audience gasped at her outburst. I laughed on the side, thinking she deserved it after all the terrible things she did to other people at school. Harper's mom stormed onto the stage and demanded they stop everything. Someone switched the approved questions. This is sabotage! She screamed. The principal hurried onto the stage and fumbled with the microphone. We'll be having a 10 minute break before continuing the Q&A. Please help yourself with some refreshments. The crowd grew loud, already making theories as to what happened. After a few minutes, the principal called me over. Oh no! I took in a deep breath and followed the towards the security room. They sat me in front of the screen and pointed. Mind telling us what you were doing at 2 p m? The footage showed me switching out the pieces of paper from the bowl very clearly. I'll tell you what she was doing.

We'd stay up watching movies and she'd sneak me candy when mom said no more sugar. But she turned into a huge jerk when she came back home from her first semester of college. She start acting like a house was her personal hotel and everyone else was just in her way. First it was the TV. She changed all the streaming passwords so only she could log in. Even told our twelve year old brother to grow up when he wanted to watch cartoons on Saturday morning while she binged Love Island all day. Now, apparently, my bathroom was her territory, too. I tried to be considerate, I really did. I'd set my alarm 10 minutes earlier so I could be done before she woke up. I kept my shampoo and stuff in a basket so everything was clean and organized and she wanted to use it. And still she complained. Gwen told our parents I was hogging the bathroom every morning, even though I showered an hour before she woke up. She complained that the steam from my hot showers made the bathroom more moldy and toxic and gave her asthma. But it was summer, so I only took cold showers. Mom scolded me, telling Me to be more considerate of my sister. But that only made her lies older. She started setting her alarm for 6:00am just to me in the bathroom. Then she'd tell our parents I woke her up. So mom scolded me again, texting, be quieter next time your sister needs sleep. The lie that really got me into trouble was when Gwen claimed she lost her dream job at a marketing firm because I hogged the bathroom that morning. I finished my shower when I heard her phone blaring job interview today over and over. But Gwen was dead to sleep. Now, I could have let her miss it, you know, especially after everything she done. But I still tried to wake her up. I shook her shoulders, turned on the lights, even pulled off her blankets. Nothing worked. When she finally did wake up, she had 20 minutes to get to her interview. She came home sobbing, mascara running down her face, saying the interviewer specifically mentioned she looked disheveled. She blamed my morning showers for ruining her career.

Dad slept on the couch from day one. Mom took the bedroom. I got a mattress on the floor of the walk in closet. They said a crib wouldn't fit anywhere else. Closet smelled like Mom's perfume and Dad's Cologne. Everything in our house had an owner. Mom's T V, Dad's coffee maker, Mom's milk, Dad's bread. They labeled everything with a label maker. The leftovers, the salt, even the ice cubes. I found labels on things you wouldn't believe. Mom's toilet paper, Dad's light bulbs. I ate cereal with water because Mom's milk was off limits and dad didn't buy any. I Learned to like black coffee at age 7 because the creamer was Mom's. I lost 12 pounds in fourth grade. The school nurse called home. They both showed up and blamed each other for starving me. Dinner would be silent. We'd sit at the same table, but they'd cook separate meals. Mom made pasta, dad made sandwiches. They'd eat at the same time, stare straight ahead. If I wanted food, I had to ask both. Usually got told no by both. Ask your mother, ask your father.

I stopped wanting birthdays by age 10. Then they started communicating through me. Tell your mother I paid the water Bill. Tell your father he's three days late. I was 11 years old, delivering divorce threats across the dinner table. By 12, I was writing their hate messages down because they wanted documentation. I have three notebooks full of their messages to each other through me. When I was 13, mom started dating. She'd bring men home while dad was in the house. Dad started bringing women home, too. They didn't.

I was 10 when my Uncle Mike started taking me to the arcade every Saturday. Just us two. No parents, no cousins. Our secret guy time, he'd say with a wink. Mom would hand me some cash and off we'd go in his rusty blue pickup truck. I felt so special, like I'd been chosen for something important. All my friends were jealous when I'd come back with stories about beating the high score on Pac Man or mastering Street Fighter. Go! Mike would cheer me on and buy me ice cream after, no matter how badly I played. You're getting better every time, champ, he'd always say. For three years straight, not a single Saturday was missed. Rain, snow. Even when I had a cold. Uncle Mike would show up at 10:00am sharp. I'd run to the door before he could even knock. When other kids complained about their boring uncles, I'd brag about mine. My Uncle Mike is different, I tell them. He actually likes spending time with me. I felt like the luckiest kid in the world. Then one Saturday when I was 13, Uncle Mike didn't show up. My mom found me sitting on the porch steps, jacket on, waiting. She looked strange. Sad, almost. Uncle Mike can't come anymore, she said quietly. I cried the whole afternoon, feeling abandoned. I didn't see him for years after that. Nobody talked about him.

On the second night, we were playing cards in the living room when the power suddenly went out. We checked the breaker box, but nothing was wrong.

I wanted to call the police, but my phone had no signal. The storm from earlier must have knocked out the cell towers. We were on our own. My friend Sophie, who's normally the quiet one, suddenly whispered, I have an idea. She pointed to the stairs leading to the basement. We need to lure him down there. The basement had a heavy metal door that locked from the outside. If we could get him down there, we could trap him until morning when the police could come. We positioned ourselves in the darkness. One by the basement door, two behind the couch, and me near The kitchen. Then we deliberately made noise upstairs. Like we were all sleeping up there. And left the basement door open. With a flashlight shining on my uncle's expensive watch collection. Within minutes, the back door slid open. The man crept through the kitchen, crowbar in hand. He spot out of the open basement door in the gleaming watches. Just as we hoped, he headed straight for them. The moment he was halfway down the stairs, Sophie slammed the door shut. And we all piled furniture against it. We could hear him banging and shouting from below. That's when things got weird. My friend Tyler grabbed my uncle's old Halloween decorations from the closet.

Helen had CPS on speed dial and used it like other people used Yelp reviews. The Bradshaw kids jumped on their trampoline without her approved safety protocols, so she called. The new mom let her four year old dress herself, resulting in mismatched clothes, so she called. My daughter ate her lunch on the front steps instead of inside, so she called. Every deviation from Helen's parenting standards meant another report. The Bradshaw family never recovered from Helen's first attack. Three kids jumped on their trampoline while dad grilled burgers nearby. Helen watched through her window and documented supposed safety violations. She reported it as child endangerment. The investigation consumed two weeks of their lives. Mister Bradshaw lost his promotion after missing work for C P S. Meetings. Helen targeted the war widow next. Her four year old coped through choosing her own outfits. She wore Dinosaur shirts with tutus and rainbow socks. All things her father bought her. Helen photographed these outfits as evidence of neglect. The mother had buried her husband three months earlier. The CPS visit shattered her remaining strength. She now picked every piece of clothing her daughter wore. Though it wasn't the same as her daughter deciding daddy was going to dress her that day. My turn came in June. My nine year old took her sandwich outside to eat while reading. I monitored her from my home. Office window perfectly. Helen filmed it all and called CPS immediately. She reported unsupervised outdoor eating and potential choking hazards. The worker arrived during my biggest client presentation. The contract that would have covered our mortgage. I lost focus and nearly lost the 800 thousand dollar contract. But worse, my daughter internalized the fear and refused to eat anywhere but inside. Everything shattered when my six year old's action figure broke one afternoon. He was exhausted from swimming and inconsolable about his toy. I comforted him in our driveway using calm parenting techniques. Helen filmed it all through her window. She recorded my child's vulnerable moment for her files.

I started a new office job and they had a super strict dress code. I have a pretty big scar on my scalp from a surgery when I was a kid, and I've always been self conscious about it. So I wore a simple, plain black beanie to cover over. It was discreet, no logos, and looked professional. For the first two weeks, nobody said a thing. Then my manager, Brenda, decided to update the dress code. She sent out a company wide email saying all headwear must be formal and business appropriate. The next day, she called me into her office. He pointed at my beanie and said it was no longer acceptable. I explained calmly, it's just to cover a scar. I'm happy to buy a different one if this color is the problem. She just shook her head. Beanies are not formal. The rule is the rule. You could wear a wig if you're that concerned. I was stunned. A wig? I couldn't afford that. And it felt so humiliating. I went home that night and read her email over and over. Formal and business appropriate. That vague wording was her mistake. The next morning, I walked in wearing a fascinator. A big bright pink one with feathers and a little net that came down over my eye. It was something you'd see at a fancy horse race. Brenda's jaw hit the floor. What is that on your head? I Smiled it's a fascinator. It's formal headwear. Is it not business appropriate? She was completely speechless. It technically followed her new rule. She couldn't say anything. The next day, I wore a sleek black pill box hat, very 1960s. The day after that, a small, classy top hat. My co workers thought it was hilarious. They started placing bets on what I'd wear next. My a little corner of the office became the most popular spot for people to walk by. Brenda got angrier every day, but I was following her rule perfectly. The breaking point came when the regional director was visiting our branch. That day, I had chosen a particularly bold peacock feather.

When they denied my wife's chemo saying it was experimental while approving the exact same treatment for others. My wife got diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer in February and the cancer doctor gave us the treatment plan that same day. Standard FDA approved treatment that everyone gets with nothing experimental about it. We sent everything to insurance feeling good, but the denial came back in two days claiming the treatment was investigational. Called right away and could hear the woman typing while I talked, not even listening. She kept saying their medical team decided it was experimental, my wife's doctor literally wrote that this was standard care. When I asked if anyone even looked at the medical records, she just repeated that their review team makes determinations based on coverage guidelines. I filed an appeal and attached 15 medical studies showing this was standard treatment, but the second denial popped up in my email 20 minutes after I hit submit. My wife saw the timestamp and started crying. They don't care if I die, do they? I couldn't answer because we both knew the truth. That night I found an online support group where three people with our exact diagnosis got in approvals, and one woman messaged me saying her treatment got approved in two days with the same medicine at the same dose, but different insurance. That's when everything clicked. I spent the weekend digging Through state insurance law, and discovered they had to respond to every appeal within 72 hours, and pay $600 for each external medical review we requested. So Monday morning, I put their system to the test. I called to file an appeal for the denial of Abraxas, and heard the representative side before he even spoke. He kept insisting I'd already filed appeals for that medication, but I explained this was for the 500 milligram dose specifically, since the others were for treatment in general. Pulled up their denial letter and read it back to him, explaining how they evaluate each aspect separately. So I'm also filing appeals for the 100 mg dose, and for weekly versus biweekly scheduling. When he said that would be three separate appeals, I told him it was actually more, because I needed to appeal each of the 12 infusions separately, plus each anti nausea medication.

My girlfriend Bianca was obsessed with skincare. Her bathroom looked like a Sephora. Hundreds of products lined up on custom shelves. She'd installed glass bottles. Korean serums, French moisturizers. She'd spend two hours every night on her elaborate routine, explaining each step like a beauty guru. I thought it was cute how dedicated she was to self care. Bianca had porcelain skin that literally glowed. She worked as a makeup artist for a local theater company, so I figured her flawless complexion was just professional knowledge paying off. Until I started breaking out. At first, it was just a few pimples on my forehead. No big deal. I'm 28, but sometimes adult acne happens, right? But then it spread. Weird, painful cysts rupt it all over my face and neck. Deep, angry bumps that hurt to touch. I'd never had acne like this in my entire life, not even as a teenager. Bianca was incredibly sweet about it. She'd examine my face with genuine concern, tracing the inflamed areas with her fingertips. Poor baby. This must be so frustrating for you. She researched online for hours, constantly offering solutions. I think it might be stress related, or maybe you're allergic to something new. She bought me special face wash, expensive serums, even booked me an appointment with her dermatologist. The doctor was completely baffled. My hormone levels were normal. No underlying health condition. Sometimes these things just happen. She said. With a shrug, let's try some topical treatments. Nothing worked. If anything, my skin kept getting worse. I looked like a pepperoni pizza. Deep red welts covered my cheeks and jawline. My confidence was completely destroyed. I stopped hanging out with friends, barely wanted to leave the apartment. Even wearing a mask felt pointless because people could still see the inflammation around my eyes. Bianca was my rock through everything. She never made me feel ugly or self conscious. You're still handsome to me, she'd whisper, kissing my forehead gently. We'll figure this out together, I promise. She suggested I start using some of her product.

So I exposed the truth about him. I found out yesterday when his iPad auto synced to the family computer. There it was in his Venmo history. Monthly payments to RM labeled lunch money every first of the month. Like clockwork, the amount matched exactly what my brother once drunkenly admitted. His apartment costs $4,000 per month. My stomach dropped. When ARAM moved to New York after college, my parents threw him a goodbye party. So proud of you for making it on your own, my dad had said. Raising his beer, that's what real men do. He'd looked directly at me when he said it. I was living in their basement, then rebuilding my career. After my online business collapsed. Dad had made it a big deal charging me 700 dollar rent. You're so ungrateful. I'm doing you a favor, he'd announced at dinner. You need to learn responsibility and be like your brother. So I paid every month while freelancing during the day and building my new business on weekends. Five hours if I was lucky. Meanwhile, Aaron was posting Instagram Stories from rooftop bars and weekend trips to the Hamptons. Your brother's just better with money, mom would say when I'd question his lifestyle. He got that finance job while you're doing nothing but being on your computer. And that finance job? Entry level at A no name firm. His apartment alone would devour most of his salary. But I believed the lie because the alternative, that my parents were lying to my face, was unbearable. The Venmo history went back three years. Some payments had notes that made me sick. Lunch money plus vacation, lunch money plus new wardrobe. All while I was buying groceries at the dollar store. I kept scrolling, my hands trembling. Now I found a synced email to their accountant that stopped me cold. Can we claim both kids as dependents? RM for support and daughter for disability? Disability? They told their accountant I was disabled. Not struggling, not rebuilding disabled. While I was working 60 hour weeks in their basement, they were writing

She doesn't know I won the lottery. Three days after the divorce finalized, the morning my wife Rebecca moved out. She actually laughed when I offered to help carry boxes to Daniel's Tesla. Even your breakups are boring. That's why I'm leaving you. In truth, I've been trying to save our marriage for months by that point, spending $800 on counseling sessions she never attended, but. And relationship books she never knew existed. Even signing us up for salsa lessons that would never happen. When she announced she'd been sleeping with Daniel for six months, I just nodded and said I'd sign whatever paper she wanted. She looked genuinely annoyed by how quietly I was accepting everything, probably expecting me to throw something or make some desperate speech about our seven years together. Instead, I folded her clothes into boxes with the same precision I used for my spreadsheets at the accounting firm. She kept rolling her eyes like my compliance was just another predictable trait, even calling Daniel while I was standing there to complain about how I was being passive about the whole thing. Divorce was finalized in three months, the fastest in our state's history. She took the house, got 15 monthly alimony, even my mother's dining set. The lawyer looked sympathetic, but stayed professional. Then, three days after signing papers, I did something completely random. I bought 5 powerball tickets at a gas Station I'd never visited before. Rebecca always said lottery tickets were attacks on stupid people. I was an accountant who should know better. She'd literally mocked my cousin for buying them at family gatherings. But that Wednesday morning, standing in an unfamiliar shell station, I spent ten dollars on tickets with my morning coffee. The second ticket hit all six numbers when they drew. That night, I won $92 million on a two dollar piece of paper. After taking the lump sum and paying taxes, I walked away with 58 million in my account. I told absolutely nobody about my windfall, not even my mother. The next Monday, I walked into my accounting firm and quit on the spot. Told them I needed to find myself or whatever people say. My boss assumed I was having a breakdown from the divorce. Within two weeks, I was on a first class flight to Monaco, sipping champagne that cost more than my old hour.

I was already emotional after having to shave one of my clients heads because she had just gone through her first round of chemo. I wiped away my tears as the door chimed, but then I felt my whole body freeze up when I realized who had just walked inside. My ex boyfriend, Kai walked in with some blonde girl hanging off his arm like a trophy. My hands started shaking as I gripped my clippers because this was the same guy who'd spent eight months ridiculing my red hair. He'd call me Wendy's mascot or fire crotch pretty much every chance he'd get to his boys behind my back. He didn't stop at anything. Every time he'd use the same pathetic excuse, even for a man who'd made an entire group chat dedicated to roasting gingers. The worst part of it all was when I overheard his new girlfriend talking about dying her hair red of all colours. I watched Kai's face scrunch up and disgust as he heard it, before he said the words that made my blood truly boil. Are you insane? Red hair is literally the worst feature a girl can have. Trust me, I know. He said it loud enough for the whole shop to hear, and then he actually kept going. I dated this redhead chick for way too long, and it Was so embarrassing. Like walking around with a human hot Cheeto. Plus, they're all psycho, every single one of them. All this happened while I was standing 10 feet away, and he had no idea. The girl at the next station literally stopped cutting halfway through to stare at him. Also in pure disbelief. Everyone in there picked up their phones, not making it obvious. As we started texting, the shop group chat exploded with messages like, is he serious right now? And bro is about to get karma. While all the girls started telepathically coming up with our plan. We immediately put down her clippers and walked over to his girlfriend. Girl, I'm sorry, but I overheard your idea, and I have to show you something. She pulled out her iPad.

She told me there was a family emergency, and my mom asked her to pick me up. Something felt wrong immediately. Her smile was too wide, her eyes too focused on my backpack, not my face. I'd never seen this woman before. No uniform, no ID badge, nothing that proved she knew my mom. But she knew my name. And that my mom worked at Memorial Hospital. My heart started racing, but I tried to stay calm. Oh, that's weird. My mom just texted me five minutes ago and didn't mention anything. I lied, patting my pocket where my phone was. The woman's smile tightened. Well, it just happened. Your mom's really worried. Just get in and I'll explain everything. Instead of walking closer, I took step back. Actually, I need to make a quick call first. What did you say your name was again? Her eyes darted to the empty street around us. There was nobody else walking, no cars passing by. Just me and her. There's no time for that. Your mom said to hurry. Her voice got harder as she reached across to push open the passenger door. Get in now! That's when I remembered the safety app my dad installed on my phone last month. It a panic that would immediately alert my parents and the police of my location. Okay, let me just grab something from my backpack real quick, I said, trying to keep my voice steady while slowly backing away. I turned slightly, unzipping my bag while keeping my eyes on her. I slipped my hand into my pocket, unlocked my phone by feel, and press the panic button three times. The woman was getting impatient. She started to get out of the car. I don't have all day, kid. Just then, a neighbor's door opened down the street. Missus Reynolds stepped out to get her mail. I've never been so happy to see our nosy neighbor in my life, Missus Reynolds

I run a boutique skincare business from my home studio, creating custom serums for clients with sensitive skin conditions. Each formula is specifically tailored. Some need snail solution filtrate from Korea, others require bakuchiol oil from India, and the really complex cases get peptide complexes that literally cost more per ounce than actual gold. A thing. Full custom batch runs me about $200 in raw ingredients, but I charge $400 because the results are incredible. My sister in law, Kayla, moved in with us three weeks before her wedding. She's always been jealous of literally everything I have my house, my business, even my husband's attention. She kept complaining about stress breakouts appearing on her face, dramatically sighing in front of mirrors, and asking if I had anything professional grade that could help her look perfect for the big day. I offered her some basic drugstore products, gentle cleansers, hydrating serums. Nothing too intense, but she kept hovering around my workstation asking detailed questions about my expensive ingredients. She'd pick up bottles, read labels, ask about prices. I caught her photographing my formula notebooks multiple times. The week before the wedding, I started working on a rush order for my most important client, a local news anchor who pays premium for custom anti aging serums. This particular formula required $300 worth of rare peptides, growth factors, and botanical Extracts. I spent two days perfecting the mixture, testing P H. Levels, ensuring stability. The morning of Kayla's wedding, I woke up early to package the completed serum for Monday pickup. Walked into my lab, set up, and immediately felt something was wrong. My bakuchiol dropper was sitting in the wrong spot. The snail mucin jar had clear fingerprints on the glass. My peptide vials were slightly out of order. I did a complete ingredient inventory.

She unplugged my life support to charge her phone while staring right at my heart monitor, knowing exactly what would happen. I had been in a car crash just three days earlier. A truck hit my side of the car when a driver ran a red light. The impact shattered my ribs, collapsed my lung, and left me with internal bleeding so bad, the doctors put me in a medically induced coma. I wasn't supposed to be conscious, but somehow I was. It's called covert awareness. When your brain is active, but your body can't respond. I could hear everything around me. The beeping of machines, doctors talking about my poor chances, and my mom crying by my bedside each night. That evening, a new nurse came in for the night shift. She seemed annoyed from the moment she walked in, sighing loudly and checking her phone every few minutes. I heard her talking to someone, complaining that her phone battery was dying and she needed it for her side hustle calls later. I couldn't move, couldn't speak, couldn't even open my eyes to show I was listening. I was trapped inside myself, completely helpless. Around midnight, when the hospital floor got quiet, I heard her footsteps coming closer to my bed. She mumbled something about needing an outlet and how it's not like he'll notice anyway. Then I heard the unmistakable sound of a plug being pulled in. Instantly, the Steady hum of the machine keeping me alive went silent and the alarm started blaring. My heart raced as panic set in. I was screaming inside my head, but my body remained perfectly still. I could feel myself slipping away as the oxygen levels in my blood dropped, but the nurse didn't rush to plug it back in. Instead, she calmly silenced the alarm, plugged in her phone, and said, relax. These machines have backup batteries. You've got, like 30 minutes before you're actually in trouble. She laughed and

I live with one. Or I should say I lived with one. It was my husband's view of our two kids. We have a daughter, Amy, who's 16, and a son, Leo, who is 17. The rules for them were so different. It was like they grew up in separate houses. Amy had a long list of chores. Had to cook dinner twice a week, do her own laundry, and keep her room spotless. She had a ten PM curfew, even on weekends. And we expected her to get good grades, which she did. She was a straight A student. Leo, on the other hand, his only chore was to take out the trash, and he usually forgot. He didn't have a curfew. His grades were just okay. But my husband would celebrate a C plus like he'd won a Nobel Prize. Whenever I brought it up, my husband would just say, he's a boy. He's figuring things out. We need to teach Amy to be responsible. The whole thing exploded one Tuesday night. Amy came home at 10:15, 15 minutes late. She was at her friend's house, helping her study for a big test. My husband grounded her for two weeks. No phone, no going out. Amy was so upset, she just went to her room and cried. Later that same night, around two in the morning, I heard the front door open. It was Leo. He'd been at a party. I went downstairs, and my husband was already there. He just looked at Leo, smiled, and said, have a good time, son. Go get some sleep. Not a single word about how late it was. I just stared at him. I looked at our son, who was walking to his room without a care in the world. Then I went to check on Amy. She was sitting on her bed, her homework perfectly laid out on her desk. She looked at me with these tired, sad eyes and said, it doesn't matter how hard I try, does it? That was it for me. The next Saturday morning I called a family meeting in the living room. I had set up a giant whiteboard. On it I had written

So I gave her something to copy that ruined completely. I've had a shadow since I married my husband four years ago and met his sister Regina. And I don't mean that in the normal sister in law boundary issues kind of way. I mean it like, if I got highlights, she got highlights. If I joined a yoga studio, she'd join the same one with the premium membership. If I bought a purse at target, she'd get the designer version and tag me in the photos. It started small, almost flattering, even. Like when she bought my wedding dress in white after seeing mine in ivory. Regina told everyone she'd had her eye on it first, didn't care since I was already married. But by the time we both got pregnant, it got disturbing. I announced it at Easter dinner, but Regina announced it at my baby shower, claiming she'd been waiting for the right moment. I chose a specific Dula after months of research. Regina hired her the next day, offering double the rate, and got my slot. When I switched to a different birthing class, Regina switched to sitting right behind me each week. My mother in law pulled me aside after Sunday lunch. You need to stop making everything a competition. Regina just wants to feel included. She's always looked up to you. This jealousy you're showing is ruining family dinners. It was Frustrating how everyone only thought about her problems. But whatever. I was focusing on my own life. Seven months into my pregnancy, I finally shared the name we'd chosen at a family dinner. Lillian, after my grandmother who'd raised me. It was the one thing I'd kept private, special, sacred, even. Two weeks later, Regina gave birth early and named her daughter Liliana. But she didn't just steal the name. She told everyone at the hospital that she'd always loved that name and had it picked since high school, making me look like the copycat. But the worst part came when I confronted my husband about it. He defended her completely, saying I was being hormonal and over sensitive about similar sounding names that aren't even identical. I sobbed for hours and kept saying, that was my grandmother's name, our daughter's legacy. She stole it.

With this amazing backyard, mom spent all spring planting tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and these special strawberries she ordered online. She was so proud of that garden. Then things started disappearing. First it was just a few tomatoes. Then entire plants were getting damaged. Mom kept saying maybe it was animals, but our yard had a tall fence. We even set up a bird feeder, thinking birds might leave the garden alone if they had other food. One morning, mom found footprints in the soft soil and knew it had to be human. That's when she started watching more closely. Turns out it was Missus Peterson from next door. She'd wait until we left for school, then hop our fence with a little basket, help herself to whatever look good, and be gone in minutes. Mom started keeping a notebook.

I've had a parasite since the day I moved into my dorm. My roommate, Ashley. And I don't mean that in the normal, bad roommate kind of way. I mean it, like, if I bought groceries, she'd eat them while I was in class. If I ordered textbooks, she'd return them for cash. If I had cash in my wallet, it would mysteriously disappear whenever she was around. She started her campaign when she forgot her I D. One morning, Ashley gave me this whole sob story about being late for her exam and needing breakfast. I swiped her in just to be kind. But when she asked again that night to borrow my card for dinner, promising she'd pay me back tomorrow, I told her no because I needed to save my guest swipes for my parents visit. That's when it got malicious. I'd find my I D. Missing from my locked desk drawer when I needed it most. Ashley would return it hours later, claiming she'd borrowed it for emergencies, like I was being unreasonable. When I started hiding it in my pillowcase, she'd somehow still get it and text me pictures from the steakhouse with her friends. When I confronted her about using my meal plan for her social life, Ashley posted on her story about fake friends who can't share. Three weeks before Finals? I got an email from dining services. Notice of account suspension. 500 dollar fine for excessive usage. My chest went tight. The timestamp showed six swipes in one hour across different locations. Impossible. The disciplinary hearing was worse. Ashley sat there with fake tears, telling them I've been selling meal access for profit. She showed them fabricated Venmo requests. She. She pressured me to help her scam the system. The administrator turned to me, disgusted. This is grounds for academic probation. I couldn't breathe. She's lying. Check the security footage. But Ashley had been giving out my I D. Number, not the physical card, so there was no proof. After the meeting, I cornered her, my whole body shaking. You set me up.

My son's third grade teacher confiscated his life saving medical snacks because they contained sugar. So I went to the local farmers market and destroyed her career with a dozen cupcakes. My eight year old son, Leo, has type 1 diabetes. If his blood sugar drops too low, he needs a juice box or fruit snacks immediately. It's not a suggestion, it's a medical necessity to prevent a seizure or coma. We had a doctor's note and a detailed plan we gave to all his teachers. But this year he got missus Davison. She was famous in the district for her strict, healthy classroom policy. She send notes home scolding parents for packing things like goldfish crackers, calling them processed poison. In her mind, the only acceptable snack was an organic fruit or vegetable. At our first meeting, I explained Leo's diabetes and showed her his emergency kit, which was clearly labeled. She looked at the juice boxes and fruit snacks with disgust. I'm sorry, but we have a no sugar policy in this classroom, she said. A medical condition is not an excuse to break the rules. An apple will work just fine. I tried to explain that an apple sugar acts too slowly during a critical low. She cut me off. I've been a teacher for 20 years. I know what's best for children. The next day, she confiscated his emergency kit. Two weeks later, I got the call I've been dreading. Leo had a severe low sugar episode during math class. Missus Davidson gave him a few apple slices. His numbers kept dropping. He was pale and shaking. By the time the school nurse arrived with his emergency kit, he was barely conscious. When I met with the principal, he backed her up, saying the school supported a teacher's discretion in maintaining classroom health standards. That Saturday, I was at the local farmers market.

Band posters on the walls, my gaming setup in the corner, clothes scattered everywhere like a tornado hit it. Dad was actually trying to be the cool parent at first. He'd order pizza for dinner three nights in a row and let me stay up as late as I wanted. I thought maybe the divorce wouldn't be so bad after all. Then about six months later, dad started dating this woman named Crystal. Yeah, I know. The name should have been a red flag. He was one of those people who smile too much and try way too hard to be your friend. Every time she came over, she'd be like, hey, kiddo, how's school?

He moved the coffee maker to a different counter and claim it had better feng Shui or whatever. She switched out Dad's beer for some organic kombucha crap that tasted like dirt.

Boxes of scented candles, throw pillows with inspirational quotes, and this weird crystal collection that she claimed had healing powers. But here's where it gets really messed up. Crystal worked from home, doing some kind of online consulting thing. She kept complaining that she needed a proper office space with good lighting and privacy for her. Zoom calls. Our house only had 3 bedrooms. Dad's room, my room, and this tiny guest room that was basically a closet with a window. I was at Mom's house for the weekend when it happened.

Maria and West Side Story. She was a sophomore with natural talent. I was a senior who'd taken voice lessons for three years. And this was literally my last shot at high school theater.

I crushed up some of the shrimp crackers from our pantry and mixed the powder into the lip balm.

Mom freaked out and rushed her to urgent care, while I got ready for school, texting my friends about how worried I was about my poor sister. At callbacks, I was the only Maria left.

We did everything together growing up, went to different colleges, but talked daily, and I was genuinely excited when he found someone who made him happy. When he told me about the engagement over dinner at our favorite restaurant, I congratulated him and jokingly asked when I should start planning his bachelor party as his obvious choice for best man. He just laughed it off and said we'll see how things go. A month later, I brought up wedding party plans more seriously during one of our weekly coffee meet UPS. He seemed uncomfortable and said they were keeping it really small and would let me know once they figured everything out. I didn't push it because I know wedding planning can be incredible, incredibly stressful, and overwhelming. Three weeks ago, I was scrolling Instagram during my lunch break and saw photos from what clearly looked like his bachelor party, Felix and about eight guys I didn't recognize at some trendy brewery downtown. I wasn't in any photos and definitely hadn't been invited. When I called him that evening to ask about it, he seemed flustered and said it was just a few guys from work and super last minute planning. He promised we'd hang out soon to celebrate. Properly, that soon never happened. Yesterday, I was mindlessly scrolling social media during my afternoon break when I saw professional wedding photos. Beautiful shots of Felix in a sharp black tux and Julia in an elegant white dress, surrounded by smiling family members and friends. The wedding had happened last weekend, three days ago. I had absolutely no idea. I wasn't just excluded from the wedding party, I wasn't even invited to the actual wedding. I found out my twin brother got married through Instagram posts from our cousins, who were there beaming in group family photos. My

My parents got divorced when I was 12, and for the last three years, every single holiday and birthday has turned into this massive guilt trip about who I choose to spend time with. My mom remarried this guy Kevin about two years ago, and he's honestly kind of a nightmare. He leaves dirty dishes everywhere, talks down to me like I'm 5, and makes these weird comments about how I need to man up whenever I show any emotion. Plus he always smells like cigarettes, even though he claims he quit. My mom just stands there and lets him talk to me however he wants cause she's scared he'll leave too. My dad started dating Ashley about eight months ago, and she's actually really cool. She's 28, so only 12 years older than me, which was weird at first, but she doesn't try to parent me or anything. She just treats me like a normal person. When I told her I was failing chemistry, she didn't lecture me about applying myself. She just said, chemistry sucks. Want me to help you study? And we spent three hours going over formulas while eating pizza. So last week was my 16th birthday, and both my parents wanted me to spend it with them. My mom was planning this whole dinner at Olive Garden with Kevin and his two kids, who are like 7 and 9 and Absolutely destroy everything they touch. She kept texting me about how important family is and how Kevin was really looking forward to celebrating with me. My dad asked if I wanted to go to this escape room place and then get burgers. He said Ashley would come too if I was cool with it. I told him that sounded way better than sitting through dinner while Kevin's kids threw breadsticks. And Kevin lectured me about college planning.

My wife had our first baby three months ago, and her mom, Janet, moved in to help out. At first it seemed great. Someone to do dishes, hold the baby while we showered, all that stuff. But Janet had other plans. He'd literally snatch our daughter Emma, right out of my arms whenever I was holding her. If Emma was crying and I went to pick her up, Janet would push past me like I didn't exist. I've got her, she'd say. Already lifting Emma before I could even react. The worst part was feeding time. My wife was breastfeeding, but we'd started mixing in some formula bottles so I could help with night feeds. Janet would hover around my wife like a hawk, watching her every move. Then she'd take the baby and refuse to give her back when it was bottle time. You're doing it wrong, Janet would say when I tried to take Emma for her bottle. Let me show you. Then she'd keep the baby for the next two hours. Last Tuesday, my wife was exhausted from being up all night. Emma was fussing around lunchtime, and I could tell she was getting hungry. My wife was trying to eat something for the first time that day. I went to take Emma from Janet, who was bouncing her on the couch.

My wedding venue is this gorgeous lakefront property that costs $200 per person. It's basically built on a cliff overlooking the water. Stunning for photos, but definitely not baby friendly. There are no railings, no baby gates, literally nothing to stop a crawling kid from going over the edge. That's why I specifically wrote adults only ceremony on every single invitation. When Andrew got his invite, he immediately called me up. Hey, sis, we're obviously bringing Hazel anyway. She's only six months old. What could possibly go wrong? I tried explaining the safety concern, how the venue is basically a death trap for babies, how there's a literal 30 foot drop to the lake with rocks below, but he cut me off mid sentence. Oh, please, you're just because you're not a mom yet and we are. That comment hit me like a truck. My fiance Shane and I have been trying for two years with no success. We've done three rounds of IVF that cleaned out Our savings. Andrew knew all of this? I was still processing that cruel comment when my cousin Rebecca called me the next day. She works as an event coordinator at the venue, and she had some interesting information. Your brother contacted us directly? She said he's asking about baby accommodation rates and whether we could waive the per person fee for infants since they don't actually eat real food. My jaw dropped.

Tyler knew I was exhausted. I work 12 hour shifts at the hospital and still come home to cook dinner, help with homework, and do the whole mom thing. But every morning when the kids would wake up excited to see where jingle moved, Tyler would make these little comments like wow, must be nice to have time for crafts or some of us have real jobs. The breaking point came last Tuesday. I had worked a double shift and dragged myself home at 2:00am. I completely forgot to move the damn elf. When Emma woke up and saw jingle in the same spot as yesterday, she started crying because she thought she'd been bad and Santa was mad at her. I felt like garbage, so I quickly made up some story about how jingle was just extra tired and needed to rest. Emma seemed to buy it, but I could see Tyler smirking at me from the kitchen. That night. I made sure to move jingle to the bathroom counter with some toilet Paper making it look like he was using the bathroom. The kids thought it was hilarious the next morning, but when I got home from work, Tyler had moved the elf to our bedroom and positioned it on my pillow with a note that said, Emma's mom needs to step up her game. I was pissed, but didn't want to start a fight in front of the kids. I moved jingle back to the living room that night, thinking Tyler would drop it wrong. The next morning, Emma came running into our room sobbing. She said jingle was being mean and there was something scary in his hands.

You're fired. I left quietly without making a scene, then told my husband to just smiled. Four hours later, panic broke out. 98 missed calls. I've been the head chef at Romano's for three years. When I started, it was a struggling family restaurant with two star reviews and empty tables. I transformed everything, rebuilt the menu, trained the staff, sourced local ingredients. Within a year, we were booked solid with a waiting list. But when old Mister Romano died last spring, everything changed. His son Giovanni inherited the place, and he had different ideas. Cut costs, use frozen ingredients. Fire half the kitchen staff. People can't tell the difference anyway, he'd say, counting receipts. While I fought to maintain the standards that built our reputation, I refused to compromise. Our lamb, also buco, was legendary. Our house made pasta brought people from three states over. I wasn't about to ruin that for Giovanni's profit margins. So on my 32nd birthday, after our biggest week ever, he called me into the cramped office above the dining room. Birthday balloons from the staff still hung in the kitchen below. Here's my surprise for you, he said with this smug grin. You're fired, effective immediately. You're too difficult to work with. I stood there, soft stained apron still tied around my waist, watching him lean back in his father's old chair like he just Solved world hunger. I didn't argue, didn't cry. Just untied my apron, set it on his desk, and walked out past the confused prep cooks who'd worked under me for years. The drive home felt endless. Three years of my life gone. My reputation, my team, my recipes, all handed over to someone who thought ketchup was a vegetable. My husband Scott, was waiting in our kitchen with a bottle of wine and that knowing smile he gets when he's up to something. How did the birthday shift go? He asked, already pouring two glasses.

Last Tuesday, I caught Charlotte stealing 20 bucks from Samantha's purse. When I confronted her, she rolled her eyes and said, you're not my real dad. You can't tell me what to do.

And teachers just told us to follow the crowd instead of following proper evacuation routes. So they came up with this plan. They'd trigger a fake fire alarm during lunch and then hide in the bathroom to see how long it took administration to figure out there was no actual emergency. Just stupid prank to waste everyone's time for 10 minutes. But when they pulled the alarm, something went seriously wrong. The main fire doors, the ones that are supposed to automatically open during emergencies, didn't budge. Kids were pushing against them, but they were completely locked. Backup exits were chained shut from the outside because administration didn't want students leaving campus during school hours. What was supposed to be a harmless prank turned into 800 students trapped in a building with no way out. Students started panicking. The alarms were blaring, but nobody could get through the exits. Teachers were yelling contradictory instructions. Some kids were having full panic attacks, thinking there was a real fire. It took 20 minutes for a janitor to find the manual override keys and unlock the doors. Twenty minutes of chaos, with kids genuinely scared they were going to die in a fire drill. Our principal was furious about the prank, but he Was more concerned about covering up the safety violations. He suspended the seniors and tried to spin the story as students interfering with emergency procedures. But parents started asking questions. Why were the fire doors locked? Why did it take so long to evacuate the building? The seniors who did the prank hired a lawyer because they were facing criminal charges for endangering public safety.

The doctors told us he would recover, but warned that he might never be able to speak again. It felt like a piece of him had been taken. He never let it stop him from trying to stay present, especially with his little sister, Rosie. She was five at the time, full of energy, always talking about everything and anything. And even though Nathan couldn't respond with words, he would still listen to every story she told. He'd smile, nod, or type little messages back to her on his phone. Most of the time, that was enough for her. But one afternoon, Rosie came home from school clearly upset. Her eyes were puffy, and she didn't say a word until she ran straight into Nathan's room. She dropped her backpack and hugged him tightly, tears rolling down her cheek. Nathan rubbed her back gently, trying his best to comfort her. She held on to him for a long time and then whispered, I just wish you could tell me it'll be okay. Nathan froze for a second. I saw it from the hallway. The look on his face broke me. He couldn't say what he wanted to say, and Rosie quietly left the room a few minutes later. After that day, Nathan started spending more Time alone. He would come home from school, eat dinner, and then disappear into his room. Every time I peeked in to check on him, he was already under the blanket. I figured maybe soccer practice was wearing him out or school was getting tougher, and I didn't want to push him to talk about it. I just let him rest. Then came Rosie's seventh birthday. The house was packed with cousins, neighbors, friends from school. There were balloons everywhere and a giant pink cake with seven candles sitting on the table. When it was time to sing, Rosie leaned forward and made her wish. She closed her eyes, smiled, and blew out every single candle in one breath. Everyone clapped, and then Nathan raised his hand. The room went completely silent. At first I thought something was wrong. He usually only did that when he needed help or something hurt. But this time his face was calm. Focus. He took a deep breath. His cheeks flushed.

For 12 years, I wasn't allowed to laugh, eat with my family, or basically exist in my own house because everything I did triggered my older brother. I'm 16 now, and my brother Jake is 20. He moved out two months ago, and suddenly my parents are acting like we're this close, happy family, but they have no idea what they put me through for over a decade. Jake has something called misophonia. He gets severely triggered by certain sounds. He. He was diagnosed when he was seven and I was four, and apparently he has a really extreme version of it. The problem? Every single one of his triggers was connected to me. My laugh, my footsteps, the way I chewed food, the sound of me turning pages when I read. Even the way I breathe sometimes would set him off. I remember being six years old, sitting in the backseat of our car, and I laughed at something I saw outside the window. Jake immediately started having a meltdown, covering his ears, yell, hitting himself. My dad pulled over and screamed at me. For being selfish and not thinking about your brother's condition. That's when the rules started. I wasn't allowed to eat dinner with the family anymore. My parents would have dinner with Jake, and when he was finished and had left the table, then I could come out of my room and eat by myself. Cold Food alone while my parents cleaned up, or watch TV. I couldn't go on family outings if Jake was coming, which was basically all of them. Movie theaters, restaurants, amusement parks. Anywhere that my normal kid sounds might bother him was off limits for me. At home, I had to walk on my tiptoes. I couldn't watch TV in the living room if Jake was around. I Learned to laugh silently, covering my mouth with both hands so no sound came out. The worst part was that I was just a little kid. I didn't understand why everyone was always angry at me for just existing. I thought I was a bad person because everything I did naturally seemed to hurt my brother.

But it was actually a setup to humiliate me when I found out. I gave her the public proposal she wanted, just not the one she expected. The ultimatum came on a Tuesday night. My girlfriend of two years, Laura, turned off the television, crossed her arms, and gave me a look I'd never seen before. We need to talk, she said. This isn't moving forward. My friends are getting engaged. Married. I'm 28, Alex. I'm not getting any younger. I'd always been honest about my timeline. While I loved her, there were things that gave me pause. Her obsession with appearances, her need for social media validation. How she spoke about friends behind their backs. Laura, we've talked about this, I said. I'm just not ready right now. Maybe in another year. No, she cut me off. My family's Christmas Eve party is in two weeks. I want you to propose to me there, in front of everyone. If you can't do that, we're done. A public proposal ultimatum felt like a hostage negotiation. I tried reasoning with her, but she wouldn't budge. It was the party or it was over. Three days later, her older sister Sarah asked me to meet for coffee, her voice tense over the phone. Sarah was Laura's opposite. Quiet, pragmatic, worked as a real estate agent. When I got there, she looked like she hadn't slept. She'd overheard Laura in Her old bedroom, talking to her best friend, Megan. Laura was laughing, bragging about the ultimatum. Sarah said she's been seeing someone else for a month. Her plan is to let you propose publicly. So she can say no and humiliate you in front of everyone. It would be her grand exit. Dramatic story she could tell for years. Megan was squealing with delight, promising to film your rejection. Sarah looked directly at me. She wants to ruin you just for a story. I couldn't let that happen. Something Chris

I think she just confessed to mass murder. When I met my girlfriend Haley, everything in my life happened way too fast, because within just two weeks, I was practically living at her place. But it didn't matter to me. She let me eat her out whenever I wanted to, was super beautiful, and even made me feel like I was the only guy on earth who truly mattered. I felt like I was on heaven until the 23rd night into us living together, because when I was just mindlessly scrolling on TikTok while I was next to her in bed, she suddenly rolled over to me and just stared at me without an expression. Ask me a question, she whispered, but I immediately realized something was wrong because her voice sounded completely flat and robotic. I nervously laughed, thinking it was a joke, but she didn't. Instead, she just grabbed my hand and yelled, ask me! So I gave in and asked, do you like it when I stick it in? Yes, I love it, she replied. Then she just turned around like nothing happened. The next morning, she looked like she had completely forgotten what happened. So when I showed her the massive wound she left on my hand, she completely freaked out and apologized a million times. I tried to forget it because I loved her too much. But the very next night, she did it again. Asked me a question. She asked again. This time I asked her, would you ever cheat on me? She just looked at me and said, no, daddy, and turned around to sleep. Every single night after that, the exact same creepy routine happened. One question, one answer, then sleep. Until one night I got super annoyed and asked what happens if I don't ask anything? She just stared at me and said, you die. Then, just like every other day, she turned around and slept. The next day, I was still horrified with what she said, so I texted her that I had to take care of my sick mom and just went to sleep at my house. But in the middle of the night, at 3:00am, she broke into my house, shook me awake, and violently told me to ask her a question. I just couldn't go on living like this, so I refused. And the second I said that, she immediately dug her nails into my skin so deep that I started bleeding. I had no idea what to do, so I asked her, when do I die? But this time she just said after me and dropped asleep on the floor. That night, I packed everything in my car, drove to the other side of the country.

She just posted something horrifying on her Instagram story. Last time I saw her, she was screaming at my mom in the driveway, told us that she was done with all of us, and then stormed off into the night. We assumed she'd be back in a couple of hours, but after 10 hours with no sign of her, we knew something was awfully wrong. At first, the cops thought it was just a dramatic teenage runaway case. When they found her phone three hours later in the middle of the woods, their tone completely changed. There were no footprints, no fingerprint, and not even a sign of where she could have gone. The cops told us that she died in a river and that it was best to just move on from her. My mom started sleeping in Aubrey's bed. My dad put locks on every door and window, and I spent every night putting missing posters around town. That was 5 years ago, and I accepted the fact that she was never coming back. But last night, while I was watching some corn, a notification popped up on my phone. Yobrey Duris just added to their story. I was super confused how that was even possible, because her account was deactivated the week she vanished. I assumed her account had just gotten hacked or something. When I clicked on her story, it showed a blurry photo of Aubrey in some disgusting Bathroom. She had the same jawline, same mole under her eye, and even the same freckles, but her skin looked kind of grayish, almost like she hadn't seen sunlight in years. And her mouth was stretched into this weird smile, like she was forcing it or something. She also put a caption on it which said, see you soon, Danny. But before I could even process what was going on, my phone started buzzing with DMs from random accounts. They were saying things like, bro, is this a joke? Why is she back? Check the next story. So I tapped back on her profile and saw that it was fully active again. Her old photos were completely restored, but all the captions were changed. All kept saying things like, he feeds through me. Danny's next. I hear him breathing. But it was the pictures that shook me the most. Each one had a shadowy figure somewhere in the background, standing behind trees, peeking from hallways, or even sitting at our dinner table in one of them. And just when I thought I saw it all, she uploaded a real called home. It was a video.

So I treated her exactly like I treat my other friends. With boundaries. Tara and I had been together for two years, living together, for one. We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer, where I was supposed to be her plus one. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends. We get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends. But not amazing partners. Here's what killed me. She said all this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay. You've already got an exit strategy? I said, we're adults. We're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies? Okay. I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. I treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7:00am. Could you drop off my work laptop? Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans. Monday works better. She didn't like that. But what was she going to say? We're just friends now. Week two, Tara started cracking. She showed up at the apartment while I was at work. Still using her key. Helped herself to groceries, did laundry, took a shower. I texted her. I'll need the key back. My friends don't have keys to my place. This is ridiculous. We live together. We used to live together.

Zara, a yoga instructor who kept mentioning my blocked chakras. Natasha, a lawyer who interrogated me like I was on trial. And Ava, the only decent one who at least looked uncomfortable. I already finished a bottle of wine before I arrived, and the humiliation started immediately. So you work in IT, Scarlet said with that condescending tone. How practical. Not very creative, though, is it? When I mentioned gaming as a hobby, Zara laughed. Gaming? Isn't that for teenagers? I dated a gamer once. He chose his PlayStation over couple's therapy. Red flag. Honestly, every answer got picked up. When I said I hoped Luna and I would be engaged in five years, Iris scoffed, maybe after five years, Luna needs someone. Who knows? Not maybe. Then came the ex boyfriend comparisons. Luna's ex, Miguel, was so Romantic! Zara said, looking directly at me. Remember when he flew her to Paris for a weekend? I bet Theo is more of a staycation guy. Miguel was intense, though, too jealous, Scarlett added. At least he had passion. Some guys are just vanilla. They all stared at me while Luna said absolutely nothing. When I finally stood up for air, Scarlett smirked. Oh, did we hit a nerve? Luna, your boy is sensitive.

At my high school, we had this ancient set of graphing calculators for math class that were constantly glitching. Half of them had dead pixels, cracked screens, or just refused to turn on. Teachers would apologize and tell you to share with someone else. During my junior year AP Calculus exam, I grabbed calculator No.. 23, which was notorious for freezing during tests. Sure enough, 10 minutes in, it completely died. Black screen, nothing. I was panicking because this test was 40% of our grade. So in desperation, I started whispering to the calculator like it was a pet or something. Come on, buddy, I said quietly. Wake up. We need to do some derivatives together. Nothing. Getting more frustrated, I tried what I thought sounded like computer commands. Enable calculation mode. Only the screen flickered and came back to life. Perfect timing. The girl next to me saw the whole thing. Oh, my god, how did you do that? I just talked to it, I whispered back, confused. After the test, she told everyone that I had special calculator powers and could fix broken ones by talking to them. I tried to explain it was just a coincidence, but nobody listened. The next week, someone handed me calculator No.. 14, which had been dead for months. As a joke, I whispered, activate mathematical functions. It turned on immediately. Now I had witnesses. Word spread that I was some kind of Calculator whisperer teachers started noticing that their permanently broken calculators were suddenly functional again. The legend grew out of control.

When my sister Chloe was diagnosed with kidney failure at 19, our whole family went crazy trying to help her. I was the only one in the family who matched for donation, so obviously I said yes. I was 22, totally healthy. Couldn't imagine losing my little sister. The surgery sucked. Two months of recovery, huge scars, tons of doctor visits. But seeing Chloe healthy again made all the pain worth it. She cried and swore she'd never waste this gift. She'd live her life the right way to honor what I did for her. For the first year, Chloe was amazing. She took all her meds on time, went to every appointment, ate right, worked out. She went back to college, started dating, seemed really grateful for getting her life back. But then things started going downhill. Chloe began skipping doctor appointments because they were too much stress. Started drinking at parties, even though alcohol was totally off limits with her meds. When I'd say something, she'd flip out and say I was trying to run her life. I'm not gonna live like some sick person forever, she'd say, I wanna actually enjoy being young. Two years after the transplant, Chloe was partying constantly. And I'm pretty sure she was missing doses of the drugs that kept her body from rejecting my kidney. Every time I brought it up, she'd shut me down. You gave me this kidney, So I could live my life, not so you could be my babysitter, she'd tell me. Then Chloe started hooking up with this loser named Derek, who was complete trash. He sold drugs, had been to jail multiple times, and convinced Chloe that her medications were just poison from drug companies trying to keep her hooked. I watched my sister slowly kill the kidney I gave her. But it got way worse. One night, Chloe called me, bawling. She was at the ER. Derek had gotten her into dealing prescription pills, and she got busted. But that wasn't even the worst part. The doctors did tests and

From your $7, $2 needs to go toward rent for your bedroom. After all, you do live here and use electricity and heat every day. That's not fair! She protested, but he kept going. One dollar goes toward utilities since you keep the lights on in your room and use our water for baths. And since you wanted to get paid for feeding whiskers, $1 needs to cover the cost of cat food and vet bills. Sophie watched in horror as her fortune dwindled down to three measly dollars. Her face turned bright red and she slammed her tiny fists on the table. This is highway robbery! I'm poor now! She spent the next 10 minutes ranting about unfair taxes and how adults were trying to steal her hard earned money. Finally, she declared that she was going on strike and stomped upstairs to her room, slamming the door behind her. The rebellion lasted exactly until dinner time, when whiskers started meowing for food. Sophie tried to ignore it, but our cat kept following her around the house, rubbing against her legs, and crying. She lasted about 20 minutes before quietly going to the kitchen, filling the food bowl, and whispering to whiskers that she was sorry. The next morning she came downstairs and announced she was willing to go back to the old system. No more contracts, no more payment demands, just regular Chores like before

She paused again, and now she was definitely fighting a smile. It's protein powder. I just stared at her. Protein powder? Vanilla flavoured protein powder.

When we asked him where he got it, he said he took it from Mommy's secret stash in the bedroom. My face went completely red.

The same night, he texted me asking for grocery money. I stared at my phone for 20 minutes watching those stories over and over. The math wasn't mathing. That weekend, Kevin showed up at my door with laundry bags and his usual sob story. His roommate had kicked him out. He had nowhere to go. Just needed to crash for a few days until he got back on his feet. I looked at his face, saw the same expression he'd had since we were kids when he wanted something, and felt something snap inside me. No, I said. He laughed like I was joking. What do you mean, no? I mean no. Figure it out yourself. His face went from confused to angry real quick. Started yelling about how I was abandoning him, how family was supposed to help family, how I was being selfish. He called me a terrible sister and said mom would be disappointed in me. I closed the door while he was still talking. For 3 weeks, I heard nothing. Mom called twice, asking if I knew where Kevin was staying. I told her to ask him. She got quiet and said she was worried about him, that maybe I should check in. I said no to that, too. Then my coworker Emma mentioned seeing someone who looked like my brother working at the warehouse where her boyfriend worked night shifts loading trucks. I didn't Say anything. But I felt weird about it for days. Kevin finally called me a month later. Not to ask for money, but to tell me he'd gotten his own apartment. A tiny studio, but it was his. He'd saved up the deposit working doubles at the warehouse. His voice sounded different.

I was at target buying groceries when my phone rang. The school secretary sounded really weird, like she was trying not to laugh. She said I needed to come pick up my nine year old son, Caleb, immediately. I asked if he was sick or hurt, and she just said, ma'am, it better if we discuss this in person. That made my stomach drop. I abandoned my cart right there in the cereal aisle and drove straight to the school. When I walked into the main office, the receptionist looked at me and immediately covered her mouth. Two teachers were whispering in the corner, and they both stopped talking when they saw me. One of them actually snorted, trying to hold back laughter. The Principal, Missus Rodriguez, came out looking like she'd been through something. Her hair was a little messy and she had this exhausted expression mixed with barely contained amusement. Missus Peterson, thank you for coming so quickly, she said, leading me into her office. Before we bring Caleb in, I need to ask you something. Has he been watching any cooking shows lately? I was so confused. Um, yeah, he loves that kids baking competition show. Why? She nodded slowly. And does he help you in the kitchen at home? Sometimes. But what does this have to do with anything? What did he do? Missus Rodriguez took a deep breath. Well, today was our Monthly birthday Celebration in his class. Parents brought cupcakes, cookies, the usual treats. Caleb raised his hand and told Missus Chen that he brought something special, too. She paused, and I could hear muffled giggling from the hallway. He pulled out a ziploc bag filled with what he called gourmet seasoning and started sprinkling it on everyone's cupcakes. Before they could stop him. I was still lost.

I used to be the family's emergency contact for everything. My little brother Kevin was 24 and still calling me at midnight because he'd spent his rent money on whatever caught his attention that week. Last time it was a drone he was going to use to start a photography business. Before that, a gaming chair that cost more than most people's car payments. Every month, same story. He'd blow through his paycheck in the first week, then show up at my apartment with his sorry eyes and empty wallet. I'd transfer him money while he promised this was the last time wearing he'd figured out his budget, had a plan. Whatever lie sounded good in the moment. Our parents had been doing this dance with Kevin since high school. Mom would slip him 20s when dad wasn't looking. Dad would lend him gas money that everyone knew wasn't coming back. When they finally got tired of it, guess who became the backup bank? The breaking point came on a Tuesday. I was at work when Kevin called panicking because his car was about to get repossessed. He needed $800 by five PM or he'd lose his way to get to his delivery job. I was in the middle of a presentation when my phone kept buzzing with text like, please, Claire, I'm literally shaking and I'll pay you back next Friday. I swear. I excused myself from the meeting, drove To the bank and wired him the money. My boss asked if everything was okay. When I came back, I lied and said it was a family emergency, which wasn't technically wrong. Two weeks later, Kevin posted Instagram Stories from some.

Emma, go away, she choked out. But I pushed the door open anyway. She was sitting on her bed holding a piece of paper, tears streaming down her face. I didn't mean to find it, she whispered. It was a letter, a letter I had written to myself but never sent, something my therapist had suggested when I was struggling with feeling like an outsider in my own home, a place where I could pour out everything I never dared say out loud. Emma had found it in my desk drawer while looking for tape for a school project. The letter said everything, how hard it was to love kids who didn't love me back, how scared I was of losing them if Kevin and I ever divorced, how I would give anything just to Hear one of them call me mom even once, how I cried in my car after every soccer game when they ran past me to hug their dad like I was invisible. How I bought them Christmas presents in July because I was so excited to make their holiday special.

Hand on her thigh at restaurants, arm around her waist at family events, whispering in her ear like teenagers while everyone else tried not to stare. He began showing up at Mom's favourite coffee shop with Becky every Tuesday, knowing full well that's where mom went for her weekly catch up with friends.

While mom sat alone at the family table, his golf buddies started making gross comments. About upgrading and asking if Becky had any single friends, which dad would laugh off like it was all harmless fun. Every time I tried to express how uncomfortable their relationship made me feel, he'd wave me off with condescending bull crap about how I'd understand when I was older, which was rich, considering his girlfriend was younger than me. By month four, it became clear that dad had completely lost sight of how he was treating the women in his life and genuinely believe this whole situation was perfectly normal. That's when dad called to announce he was throwing Becky a massive garden party for her birthday, complete with catering, a live DJ, and a guest list full of his business partners and their wives.

Tonight, I discovered it's not a tradition. It's a death sentence. Everyone thinks it's just tradition. You take my great grandfather's 1967 Mustang and drive Route 47 through the mountains alone for three days. My dad did it, Uncle Marcus did it, and even my grandfather Ezra would get this weird look whenever someone mentioned the drive. I was actually excited because finally I get a break from college applications. The car itself is beautiful, with cherry red paint, white racing stripes, and original leather seats that smell like motor oil and something metallic I could never identify. The radio only picks up AM stations, but that's part of the charm, right? I left Saturday morning with my dad's handwritten directions, and Route 47 cuts through Millfield National Forest. 180 miles of nothing but trees and mountains. I hit the dead zone. Mile marker 23 was where the cell service cut out completely. But the radio started acting weird, too. Instead of static, I kept hearing fragments of conversations. A woman's voice saying, told you we shouldn't have come this way. A man laughing, kids singing. I figured it was atmospheric interference, but the voices were so clear and close, like they were right there in the car with me. At mile marker 31, I passed an abandoned gas station, and second I drove by, the radio exploded with sound. Cash registers ding, engine bells, and a cheerful Voice asking, fill her up. It lasted exactly 10 seconds, then cut back to silence. My hands were gripping the steering wheel so hard, my knuckles were white. Because this wasn't interference, but something else entirely, I started paying attention to every detail. Mile marker 45 had a rusty guard rail with fresh skid marks. And the radio screamed. Actual screaming, with a man's voice yelling, brake! Brake! Followed by the horrible crunch of metal. Mile marker 52 was an old hiking trail entrance. Children laugh. Then a woman saw, Emma? Emma, where are you? Every location had its own audio and memory, like the road was a giant recording device playing back moments from everyone who'd ever driven through. But here's what made my blood freeze. Some voices were familiar. Mile marker 67. I heard my Uncle Marcus, but teenage Marcus, his voice cracking as he said, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Please don't make me. Mile marker 78 played my dad's voice, 20 years younger, saying, it's watching me. God help me, it's actually watching me. And mile marker 89 had my

Last night it was my roommate. I should have known my studio apartment was too cheap to be real, but I was desperate after dropping out of college and needed something I could afford. The day I moved into Maple Street Apartments, two girls knocked on my door and told me the rules I'd apparently agreed to without reading my lease. Every night someone walks down the street screaming for help, said Zoe, a girl with choppy black hair who was sitting on my bed like she owned the place. Different person each time. They scream for about an hour. But we aren't supposed to help them. Her friend Luna, who had red braids and was chain smoking by my window, nodded grimly. It happens at different times every night. We never know when it's coming, but we get a warning on our phones. I laughed because it sounded like the stupidest prank I've ever heard. What kind of warning? You'll see, Zoe said with a wicked smile that made my stomach turn. That night they came back with two guys, Marcus and Tyler, carrying wine and cigarettes. We sat on my floor by the window and they explained how all the young people lived in our building, while families lived next door and elderly people lived across the street. We've been sorted into groups, Luna said, taking a long drag from her Cigarette around midnight all our phones went off at once with an ear splitting alarm like an Amber Alert, but louder. The sound echoed throughout the entire neighborhood. Hundreds of phones screaming in unison do not interfere! It's coming! Marcus whispered, and his whole demeanor changed from relaxed to terrified. We sat in complete silence for what felt like forever. And then I heard it in the distance. A cry for help, getting gradually closer and more desperate. I leaned out my fourth floor window and saw an elderly man in a blood stained hospital gown stumbling from door to door, leaving a trail of dark red behind him. Where his arms should have been there were only bloody stumps. And when he looked up at our building, I knew he was staring directly at me. Help me! He whispered, and then began screaming in a voice that didn't sound human. Luna yanked

What naive comment from your child exposed how much they had suffered before? My wife and I were trying to conceive for a long time, and even though we knew she was infertile and I couldn't produce proper seeds, we didn't give up. So when we finally saw the plus sign on a pregnancy test, I almost ran a Marathon. My wife cried so hard, it depleted all her energy. I was about to tell everyone in our lives, but my wife stopped me, saying she wanted to be sure before she told anyone. So we immediately booked a doctor's appointment. But the doctor delivered the worst news of our lives. It was a false positive, and my wife wasn't pregnant. We went home feeling defeated, and my wife barely said a word to me. I couldn't even think of anything new to say to her. I already told her, maybe next time we'll get lucky. Or we just need to keep trying. At this point, it just felt like I was lying to her. But then my wife said something that surprised me. She said, maybe we should adopt. I wasn't against the idea. It didn't matter to me how we got a kid. I just wanted one. So we started the adoption process after talking about it for a couple weeks to make sure this is something we really wanted to do. Fast forward to now. We adopted a boy named Lucas. He was nine and Small for his age, and we noticed he had this habit of being overly polite. My wife theorized that he was probably afraid we'd send him back to the orphanage if he breathed too loudly and said we needed to do our best to make him feel welcome. So we did. We gave him his own room, went shopping to decorate it, asked him to join us for movie nights and talk to him about his life. But it seemed like we were falling on deaf ears. Lucas made no effort to try to get to know us. His room didn't reflect an ounce of his person.

My daughter had asked to sleep in my room for the third time in a row. She's five, so I assume she was having nightmares. Or maybe she was going through a clingy phase. When she I asked for the fourth time, I said yes, and as I was tucking her in, I asked why she kept asking to sleep in my room. She couldn't look at me as she told me, because Mommy's friend gets into bed with me when you're gone. Her words didn't fully register at first. I asked her what she meant, and she repeated it, adding that Mommy says it's okay because he's like family. I couldn't sleep at all that night. The next morning, I told my wife what our daughter had said and asked if anyone had been over recently. She brushed it off almost instantly, laughing a little and saying our daughter probably meant a stuffed animal or had made something up. She said, you know how kids are and change the subject. The way she said it was off, as if she was prepared for that question and had her answer ready. A few days later, I told her I had to leave town for a short work trip. In reality, I stayed in a nearby hotel and logged into the security cameras I had installed last year after a neighbor's house had been broken into. I'd almost forgotten they were Even still active the next day, I got a motion alert around 9:30 p m. From the hallway camera. When I opened the feed, I saw a man I didn't recognize. He kiss my wife, who entered our bedroom right after. But the man kept walking through the hallway and went straight into my daughter's room. He just walked in like he belonged there. And my wife was fine with it. I was so scared for my daughter, I instantly got in my car and drove straight home. When I walked through the door, I didn't say a word. Not even when my wife popped out of our room and nervously asked me what I was doing back home so early. Push past her and went into my daughter's room. I turned the light on, and there was this man under the covers with my daughter and hovering over her like he was ready to pounce. Everything after that was a blur. I threw punches. He fought back. My wife yelled at me to stop. My daughter cried hard. After he was blue in the face. I picked up my daughter, grabbed

Years later, his worst fear came true. My father has always favored my sister. Not only does the family call him out on it, he admits to it. His defense is that my sister looks so much like our late mother that he can't help but spoil her. My sister caught onto this and used it to her advantage. If she wanted something from the store, she had to say, please, dad, and he would get it for her. If I asked for something, my dad would ask me what I had done to deserve it. And if I couldn't think of something good, I hadn't recently. I didn't get it. Never. My sister did something bad, she would begin to cry, and dad would easily forgive her. If I did something bad, I always had to face the full consequences. Dad would leave work and get my sister from school for anything as small as a splinter, while I could be throwing up. Dad would say he couldn't leave work, and I had to tough it out. I tried hard to earn his love and attention, but nothing worked. I tried excelling at school, acting out, and even forcing myself to get into his hobbies in hopes we would bond that way. The day I gave up was the day I found out how little my dad cared about me. I was Turning 15, the plan was for me, my dad, sister, uncle and two friends to go to an arcade two hours away. The day before my birthday, my sister got the sniffles. My dad could not travel and we would have to cancel the trip. I tried to convince him to leave her with our grandparents, but he didn't want to leave her to suffer alone. He told me to call my friends and tell them while he went and called my uncle. After he walked away, I went and cried my eyes out. About a gallon of tears. Later, I got a call from my uncle telling me not to worry. He would take us to the arcade. I had a great time and forgot all about my dad and sister.

All I wanted was to get through T S A, board the plane, and flat line peacefully for six hours while pretending I'm not sitting in economy with my knees in my chest. But no. We're walking through security. I'm taking off my belt like a nervous strip. The line is long, my kids chewing gum like a mob boss. And suddenly, out of nowhere, this boy turns to a TSA agent, points at me, and says, dad, why won't you show him the dangerous thing in your bag? You stupid. The bitch! That sentence aged me 15 years and 5 seconds. I look down at him, stunned, like he just confessed to murder on my behalf. What dangerous thing? I don't even carry nail clippers. I'm the kind of person who apologizes to metal detectors, but TSA. TSA doesn't do nuance. They heard dangerous plus bad bag and activated airport SWAT mode. Like they Were auditioning for C S. I fear it Airlines Edition. Suddenly, I'm surrounded. One guy grabs my arm, another grabs my bag. I'm being yanked out of line like I'm on America's most wanted dad edition. And someone shouts, don't move! Like I'm going to backflip into an escape tunnel and flip flops. They pull me into a side room so fast, I swear my soul got left behind in G D. 12. Inside, it's like an interrogation scene from a low budget crime show. Fluorescent lighting, cold metal chair. The kind of silence that smells like latex gloves. And judgment.

There are moments in life where you're just trying to be a decent human. And then there are moments where that decency gets turned into a federal crime scene. This is about one of those moments. I was at the mall already. A place where humanity goes to die. I didn't even wanna be there. But my phone charger had just died for the third time that month, and I was tired of holding it at the perfect 47 degree angle just to get two percent battery. I go to one of those overpriced tech kiosks in the middle of the mall. The ones run by people who either want to sell you a screen protector or aggressively thread your eyebrows. While I'm waiting to be ignored by the guy behind the counter, I see this woman walking by. Middle aged, red coat, large sunglasses, indoors, like she's avoiding paparazzi. And she drops a bunch of coins. Not bills, not a card, coins. Like she was paying rent in 2003. They scatter across the floor like she just cast a spell in a Sonic the hedgehog game. And everyone around just watches, like the floor suddenly turned into lava because the coins touched it. So, being a functioning human being, I bend down and help her gather them up. I don't say anything. I'm not trying to strike up a conversation. Just grab a few quarters, put Them in a neat little pile and stand up like, here you go. That's when she steps back, eyes wide, and says, I didn't say you could touch me. And she says it loud. I freeze, ma'am. I touch the floor. She looks around dramatically, scanning for witnesses, like we're filming a courtroom drama. I don't feel safe right now, she says. Then she locks eyes with mall security. And mall security, of course, is already walking toward us, like they just sensed a disturbance in the pretzel force. At this point, I'm standing there holding a nickel, like it's the security. Guy walks up, is there a problem here? She points at me like I'm an escaped criminal. He tried to take my money and got all up in my space. I don't know him. He just came out of nowhere.

So I made her start hearing voices in the walls. She lit the match that killed my sister and walked away richer for it. My sister Claire lived on the top floor of that crumbling apartment complex. She was already planning to move out, saving every penny. But she didn't get the chance. The fire started at 2:00am. Four tenants barely escaped through smoke and stairwells. Claire didn't. The investigation said faulty wiring, but I knew better. We all did. The building had been half empty, half condemned. And our lovely landlord, Marjorie Shaw, had been whining for months about ungrateful tenants and rising taxes. And then suddenly, she's crying for the news cameras, standing outside with perfect makeup, sobbing about her beloved building. Within six weeks, she got her payout. $300,000. And Claire got a closed casket. I thought about killing her. I pictured it a thousand ways. But Claire wouldn't have wanted that. So I found a better kind of punishment. Marjorie used part of the insurance money to buy a dream home in the quiet hills outside town. Big place. Isolated, old. No neighbours close enough to hear anything. Perfect. I posed as a pest control worker and scoped it out a week before she moved in. Access? The crawl space, attic walls. I mapped the structure. The pipes, the old ductwork no one had touched in decades. This house had bones. Creaky ones. With the right pressure timing, Sound. It could speak, and I taught it how. Week one, two nights after she moved in, I started small. A soft tap, tap, tap in the ceiling above her bed. At 3:00am the next night, it was water dripping behind the walls in the hallway, pipes she didn't have. Then a whisper. Just one, while she brushed her teeth. Help me, she told herself. It was the house settling. Week two, I slipped in while she was out and placed an old baby monitor inside the wall vent in her living room. Nothing electronic on my end. It only played back a loop. Static, then faint giggling, then static again. She unplug

Some people hurt others for power, others for sport. But Brandon. Brandon hurt people because he thought the world owed him entertainment. He was the kind of guy who laughed a little too hard when someone tripped in public. The kind who once stole a blind guy's cane as a prank and posted the video with crying emojis. He lived off Daddy's hedge fund, drove a custom wrapped B M W, and probably believed poor people were fiction. Me? I was a broke grad student tutoring to pay rent and not go insane. And that's how I met Izzy. Izzy was 14, bright, sweet, and sharper than most adults I knew. She also happened to be deaf in one ear, partially in the other. She wore a bright purple hearing aid and never apologized for it. And why should she? She was proud of who she was. She called her hearing aid Thor's hammer and told people it helped her hear the thunder. But then came Brandon. One afternoon, we were studying outside a cafe. Izzy liked the background noise, said it helped her focus. I went inside for coffee. When I came back out, Izzy was crying. Not just tear. First she was shaking, palms pressed to her ears like she was trying to plug them without knowing why her hearing aid was missing. Brandon was across the patio holding it. Dangling it like a toy between his fingers. This thing. He grinned. I thought it was a weird airpod. Then he dropped it. Stepped on it. Crack. He laughed. His girlfriend giggled. People stared. No one said a thing. Izzy didn't cry out. She just stared at the ground like silence had swallowed her whole. Brandon walked away like he'd won a prize. That was the last day I tutored Izzy. But it was the first day I started planning. If Brandon thought silence was funny, I'd show him what silence really felt like. And I wouldn't do it with fists. That would be too quick. This needed to echo step one. I got close. I faked an identity online. Logan, Audio engineer for a luxury headphone company, messaged Brandon, offering him a free prototype for his podcast. He didn't have one, but I knew his ego wouldn't let that stop. He bit faster than I expected. Met him in person. I wore a suit, clean shave, fake I D. Badge. Handed him what looked like a premium, ultra modern headset, custom moulded inside. A firmware override I built myself. It could silence everything with a single tap from my phone.

Do you know that feeling when you walk into a place thinking, hey, these people fix cars, and walk out thinking, oh, cool, I just donated $2,000 to the local scammers retirement fund? That's what happened to me, thanks to Randy. The human equivalent of a grease stain. So my check engine light came on. No biggie. No smoke, no shaking, no fast and furious soundtrack blaring from under the Hood. Just a little glowing light that basically says you're about to spend money you don't have. I took it to Randy's Auto Experts, a shop with five stars and one working bathroom. He walked out like a cartoon mechanic, greasy rag in hand, trucker hat, and a mustache that looked like it had seen things. He said, don't worry, we'll take care of you. That was line number one. Two hours later, he came back with the confidence of a surgeon who just found your wallet wide open. So your catalytic converter is done, your brake lines are shot, and your transmissions throwing tantrums. I blinked. My car was driving fine yesterday. He nodded. Like a profit. Yeah, well, sometimes they just explode quietly. How much? I asked, clutching my dignity. Parts and labor. Around $2,000. But that's a steal, he said, like I should be thanking him for the privilege of being robbed. I hesitate, but I needed the car, so I said yes. That was mistake number one. Fast forward a week, and $2,000 later, I pick it up, and it looks fine. Smells like burnt coffee, but fine. Three days later, the check engine light popped back on. Like, surprise! I missed you. I took it to a real mechanic, one who didn't look like he moonlit as a carnival ride operator. He popped the hood, glanced around, and went, uh, this hasn't been touched at all. Turns out Randy hadn't replaced anything. Just clear the error codes and maybe spit on the engine for good luck. Now, at this point, I had two options. Cry into a pillow, make it my life's mission to legally and spectacularly destroy his business. Guess which one I picked first. I hit the internet. Google, Yelp, Facebook reviews. I wrote a novel titled This Place Robbed Me Blind and stole my will to live. I attached photos, receipts, and probably an emotional support gift. His rating dropped fast.

My 15 year old daughter ginger kept rubbing her right cheek, wincing now and then. What's wrong? I asked. I don't know, she said, frowning. It's sore and there's this weird lump inside. That was enough to set off my parental alarm bells. The next morning I took her straight to the army hospital. A kind but serious looking doctor examined her, his fingers pressing gently against her cheek as she flinched. Then with a grave expression, he pulled me aside. I don't want to alarm you, he said. Look, looking very much like he was about to alarm me, but this appears to be an extremely rare form of facial cancer. He rattled off some long, ominous sounding name that I promptly forgot in my rising panic. He scheduled a consultation for the next afternoon with a team of specialists. As we left, I decided not to tell ginger. Why worry her if there was even in a small chance it was nothing? The next day she came home from school early and we headed back to the hospital. As I parked the car, she suddenly scrunched up her face and started spitting. Ugh, that tastes awful, she said, gagging. She spit into a Kleenex, revealing a tiny hard blob in the middle of her saliva. Inside, six doctors stood waiting for us, their faces a perfect mix of concern and professional anticipation. This was a rare Case after all, I nudged ginger. You better show them the Kleenex. She held it out, and the expressions on their faces shifted in real time. Concern turned to confusion, confusion to disappointment. One of them sighed. It wasn't cancer. It wasn't even remotely serious. It was just a Calcium deposit that had decided to make a dramatic exit through her saliva gland at the perfect moment. Relief flooded through me, but I couldn't help but notice the doctors

In my family, December 3rd is off limits. No one is born on it, no one dies on it. No celebrations, no gatherings, no flights, no weddings, no trips. It's circled in thick red ink on every calendar in every relative's house. Growing up, it was just the day. If you asked why, you got a cold look and a quick we don't talk about December 3rd. I assumed it was just a creepy superstition. My cousins and I used to joke that it was the day someone sold their soul or buried gold or something equally ridiculous. But the adults, they didn't laugh. Ever. When I turned 28, I was engaged to the love of my life, Harper. She was funny, brilliant, and absolutely not into weird family rules. I didn't bring up the whole December 3rd thing until we started planning our wedding. Turns out, the only date available at our dream venue was. Yep, December 3rd. I hesitated, not because I believed in any of it, but because I could already hear my mom's voice in my head. Over my dead body. Harper looked at me and said, do you actually believe anything will happen? No, I admitted, but my family will freak. So we did what rational adults do. We eloped. Quiet ceremony, close friends, no announcements. We figured we'd have a bigger party later and just say it was on a different date. We even posted the photos. On December 4th to avoid triggering anyone. And for a while it worked until my uncle's wife, who has the social media skills of a teenage spy, zoomed in on a cake photo.

My uncle told me drop out of high school and start a lawn care business. Rich people are too lazy to mow their own grass, and they'll pay anything to avoid sweating. When I was 16, I was barely passing my classes, and everyone kept saying I needed to graduate to have any future. My parents were constantly on my case about grades, threatening summer school if I didn't bring up my G P A. But Uncle Mike had a different perspective. He'd been watching me work on his landscaping crew during summer since I was 14. Your wasting time in those classrooms, he said. One afternoon, while we were edging a mansion's lawn, these people just paid me $200 to cut grass that took two hours. Do the math on what college graduates make per hour versus what I charge. That conversation stuck with me. Started paying attention to how much customers were willing to spend on lawn care. One lady paid $150 every week just for basic mowing and trimming. Another guy paid $500 monthly for full landscape maintenance. These weren't struggling families. They were doctors and lawyers who valued their time more than money. Everyone thought I was crazy. When I dropped out junior year, my parents threatened to kick me out. My teacher said I was throwing my life away. My friends couldn't believe I was choosing yard work over a diploma. You'll regret this forever. My guidance counselor warned, nobody respects people without education. But I took my savings from working weekends and bought a used truck, commercial mower, and basic equipment. I started with my uncle's overflow customers who needed extra help during busy season. Word spread.

I got a call from my eight year old son's school during my lunch break. Hi, this is missus Connelly, Oliver's teacher. The woman said, trying to sound casual. I just had a quick question about his homework. Nothing urgent, but are you currently living in a hotel? The question hit me like a truck. Excuse me? I asked. No, we're in an apartment. Why? She hesitated. It's just that in his assignment he wrote that he and his mom live in a hotel. And while the rest of the essay is a little unusual, I drove to the school, heart pounding. I knew my son had an overactive imagination, but now I was nervous. Had I said something in passing that confused him? Or worse, had I missed something he was trying to say? Missus Connelly handed me his paper when I arrived. My life in the hotel by Oliver G. I live in a hotel with my mom. It doesn't have a front desk or a breakfast buffet like the ones in movies, but it has vending machines and neighbors who yell a lot, which is kind of the same. Our room has one big bed. I sleep on the side near the AC because mom says she gets cold easily. I like that I can hear the trains at night. They sound like monsters in the distance. We used to have A real house. It had carpets and stairs and a garage door that beeped. I miss it. But mom says it's okay because we're having an adventure. She says we're just between homes. I don't know where between is, but I think it must be where tired people go. Sometimes mom cries in the bathroom. I know because I can hear the faucet running. And she only run.

My mom nodded along, saying, some kids take after distant relatives, but I never did grow into those features. While my parents and older brother all had dark hair and brown eyes, I had blond hair and green eyes. Teachers would do double takes at parent teacher conferences, clearly wondering if I was adopted. The questions followed me through high school. Friends would joke about me being the mailman's kid, and my parents would just laugh it off. Genetics are funny, they'd say. You never know what combinations you'll get. When I was 18 and applying for college scholarships, I needed my birth certificate for financial aid. That's when I found something strange. In my mom's filing cabinet, two birth certificates with my name on them. One listed my parents as usual, but the the other had different names entirely. I confronted my mom about it, and she broke down crying. We were going to tell you when you turn 21, she sobbed. We just wanted you to feel like you belonged. First. Truth was devastating. My biological mother was my mom's younger sister, Sarah, who'd gotten pregnant at 17. The family was deeply religious and couldn't handle the scandal, so they sent Sarah away for the pregnancy. When I was born, my parents officially adopted me, but told everyone I was theirs. Sarah had died in a car accident when I was three, and the family decided to keep the secret rather than burden me with the truth. Everyone in our extended family knew except me. But

The hugs stopped completely. If I tried to hug him, he'd pat my back twice and step away like I was on fire. At first, I thought I smelled bad or something. I started using extra deodorant and changing clothes twice a day. When that didn't work, I figured maybe I was getting too old for hugs.

He practiced dribbling in our driveway for hours, shooting hoops until it was too dark to see. His room was covered with NBA posters, and he knew every stat for his favorite players. When middle school tryouts were announced, bake couldn't sleep for a week. He'd been preparing all summer, running laps around our neighborhood and practicing free throws until his hands were raw. This is it, dad, he said. This is my chance to be on a real team. The day of tryouts, he woke up at 5:00am to practice one last time. I drove him to school early, watching him bounce nervously in the passenger seat. You've got this, buddy, I told him. Just have fun out there. When I picked him up that afternoon, something was different. He got in the car without his usual post practice energy, threw his backpack in the back seat, and stared out the window. How did it go? I asked, expecting his typical play by play breakdown. Fine, he mumbled, still not looking at me. That was it. No excitement. No details about drills or scrimmages. Just silence for the entire drive home. Over dinner, I tried asking again. His mom joined in, both of us curious. About his unusually quiet mood. Finally he looked up from his untouched plate and said, Coach Miller told me I'm too small to ever be good at basketball. My heart sank. Jake was shorter than most kids his age, but he made up for it with determination and skill. What exactly did he say? I asked carefully. During scrimmage, I kept getting the ball stolen by bigger kids. Coach pulled me aside and said I should consider trying other sports because guys my size don't make it in basketball. He said, I just

Our vice principal, Missus Rodriguez, had this corrupt system where she'd suspend students for dress code violations and force them to buy overpriced school clothes from her personal collection to get back into class. She called it maintaining standards, but everyone knew it was straight up extortion. The worst part was targeting kids whose families couldn't afford designer clothes. If you wore anything she deemed inappropriate, which could be perfectly normal jeans or sneakers, you'd get suspended until you bought her marked up approved clothing. This quiet sophomore, Maya, was heading to her AP chemistry class when Rodriguez cornered her by the lockers. Maya was wearing regular black jeans and a plain gray sweater. Nothing remotely inappropriate, Miss Chen, those jeans are too tight and that sweater is unprofessional, Rodriguez announced with her usual smirk. You're suspended until you can dress appropriately for a learning environment. Maya just stood there, calm as anything, and said, okay, but you should probably know these clothes cost 300 dollar total. The jeans are designer and the sweater is cashmere from Nordstrom. Rodriguez actually scuffed. Nice try, honey. I know discount store clothes when I see them. You can buy proper attire from our school collection for $150, or your parents can meet with me about your inability to follow basic dress codes. Maya nodded thoughtfully. All right. Can I at least get written documentation of exactly which part of the dress code I'm violating? Something that references the specific rule I broke. We don't need to justify obvious violations to students, Rodriguez replied dismissively. Interesting. Maya pulled out her phone and started recording. Could you repeat which dress code rule I'm violating? For the record, Rodriguez tried to grab the phone. You can't record school disciplinary meetings, actually

When did your parents favoritism come back to bite them? My younger sister Chloe was treated like royalty from birth, while I was the family's forgotten child. Same house, same blood, but completely different worlds. I had no idea how twisted their favoritism really was. Until I discovered the sick truth behind it all. Growing up, Chloe got the princess treatment, while I got scraps. We both wanted piano lessons. She got enrolled with the city's best instructor, while I was told we couldn't afford two kids in music. When we both needed laptops for high school, she got the latest MacBook, while I got a used computer from Craigslist that barely worked. The excuse was always the same. Chloe shows more potential, so we need to invest in her future. But the real betrayal came when I was 18. I've been working at McDonald's to save for college and finally had enough for my first semester at state school. Question was thirty five hundred dollars and I was eight hundred dollars short. My parents said they were broke and couldn't help. Two days later, Chloe decided she wanted to go to cheerleading camp in California. They dropped four thousand dollars on her trip without hesitation, calling it a growth opportunity. That's when I started questioning everything about our family dynamic. Began watching their spending patterns closely. What I discovered made me physically sick. They had a secret credit card they used exclusively for Chloe's Expenses. Every time they claimed poverty with me, they were maxing out cards for her wants and desires. But the real bombshell came when I was 21 and Chloe was 19. I was helping dad organize his office when I found a folder marked Insurance Documents. Inside were medical records, birth certificates, and something that stopped my heart cold. A DNA test from when Chloe was 5 years old, proving she wasn't Dad's biological daughter. I confronted mom. That

For eight months, sane acted like my boyfriend in every way possible. We hung out four times a week. He'd sleep over constantly, even had his own drawer at my place. He'd get visibly jealous whenever other guys talk to me at parties, always finding excuse just to interrupt conversations or pull me away. He bought me flowers just because, remembered my coffee order perfectly. And we'd spend entire weekends together, binge watching shows and cooking dinner like a real couple. My friends all assumed we were dating. My family invited him to barbecue. Even his mom would ask about his girlfriend when she called. But whenever anyone directly asked if we were together, Zane would laugh it off awkwardly. Oh, no, we're just really close friends. I'm not ready for anything serious right now. It stung every single time, but I kept hoping he'd come around. I thought maybe he just needed more time to feel comfortable with labels. Last Friday night changed everything. We were at Kelsey's birthday party, and this girl, Alexis from his work showed up. She was clear, really flirting with him all night, touching his arm, laughing way too loud at his jokes. Finally, she looked me up and down and asked directly, so are you his girlfriend or what? Without hesitation, Zane immediately said, oh, no, we're definitely not together. I'm completely single. Actually, he even stepped Slightly away from me. When he said it, the humiliation hit me like a truck. Everyone with an earshot was staring. Kelsey looked mortified for me.

I replied, I'm getting married next month, and she completely lost her mind. I'm Aaron, 29, physical therapist in Denver. Eight months ago, I thought I had life figured out with Allison, my girlfriend of two years. We were living together, splitting rent, and I was shopping for engagement rings during lunch breaks. Then came that Tuesday night in February. Allison seemed off all day, distracted, checking her phone constantly. When we got home, she sat me down with this serious expression. I need to talk to you about something important. She dad fidgeting with our throw pillow. I've been thinking about my life. My stomach dropped. Nothing good ever started with those words. I've realized I've been jumping from relationship to relationship since I was 18. I've never taken time to figure out who I am as an individual. I don't know what I want for my career or what makes me happy outside of whoever I'm dating. The breakup speech was, I need to work on myself. I need space to figure out who I am. I'm not ready for anything serious. I need to learn how to be alone. She seemed genuine, even Cried, explaining how this wasn't about me personally, how I was amazing, but she needed to do this for herself. I respect did her decision, even though my world was collapsing. I helped her pack that weekend, staying calm while internally screaming. She found a studio apartment and seemed relieved loading boxes. I hope you understand someday, she said. Leaving. This is something I have to do. I wished her well and watched her drive away, then spent hours staring at empty spaces where her things used to be. I didn't reach out after that. If she needed space, I'd respect. I removed her from social media, not from anger, but because seeing her new life would have been torture. Six weeks later, my friend Matt invited me to join his volleyball league.

Three hundred dollar wine bottles, multiple appetizers, desserts. They were having the time of their lives. My aunt ordered three different entrees just to try them. My uncle got the most expensive scotch on the menu. My mom kept calling the waiter over like he was her personal servant. And through it all, I sat in my corner sipping water, watching them celebrate my achievement without me. My cousin Hannah kept taking photos for Instagram. Family dinner vibes she posted, making sure I wasn't in any of the shots. Uncle Joseph started telling. Embarrassing Stories about my childhood. Remember when little Zachary wanted to be a superhero?

I replied, okay. When they tried to log into the company servers the next day, they realized the family business was built entirely on the code I had just revoked. I, twenty eight male, just got the most hilarious text from my brothers. After five years of building what they called the family business, they've decided to vote me out. My brother's Garrett, 35, and Toby, 32, started a logistics consulting firm in 2019. What they actually had was a fancy name, business cards, and exactly zero clients. Six months in, they came crawling to me. Fresh out of college with a computer your science degree, they needed someone to handle the website. What they actually needed was someone to build an entire automated system from scratch. Client portal, inventory tracking, route optimization, payment processing, the works. Took me eight months of nights and weekends. They paid me in pizza and promises. Here's the thing. I never transferred ownership of the code. It's all licensed through my personal LLC. They signed without reading because we're family. Fast forward five years. We're pulling in $2.8 million annually. My systems handle everything. They just shmooze clients and collect checks. Last week, things got interesting. Garrett's wife, Mallory, suddenly became operations director, a made up position where she reorganizes filing cabinets and changes email fonts. Toby's girlfriend, Kelsey, became social media manager for our B to B company that doesn't even Need Instagram. Both making DOLLAR85K annually by the way. Meanwhile, I'm still maintaining every line of code, updating systems, handling server crashes at 2:00am, and taking my measly 20% cut as the tech guy yesterday at four PM. Hey, we held a partner's meeting and voted. You're out. The business needs to evolve beyond just tech stuff. Hack.

Granny raised me, and she'd always say stuff like, go ask your sister Tori when I needed help with homework, or Tori, take your sister to the store. I thought it was totally normal. My friend Emma had an older sister who babysat her sometimes, so I figured that's just how families worked. Tori was 17 when I was 12, which should have been my first clue, but kids don't really do math like that. She picked me up from school every day in this beat up Honda with a cracked windshield. She'd blast music and let me sit in the front seat, which made me feel so cool. She came to every parent teacher conference with Granny, crying when I got good grades, like she was actually proud.

Weird rash, probably from sweating too much. Lose weight. So when I started getting these crazy chest pains, I already knew what was coming. But these weren't like normal chest pain. They felt like someone was stabbing me right through my sternum with a hot knife. Sharp, sudden, and deep. I'd be sitting there watching TV and suddenly feel like I was being impaled. I went to the ER on a Tuesday night around nine PM. The place was packed. But when you say chest pain, they usually take you back pretty quick. The attending doctor was this middle aged guy who walked in, took one look at me, and I could literally see him making assumptions. He poked my stomach a few times, asked how much I exercised, and said the pain was probably just acid reflux or anxiety from stress eating. I tried to explain that it didn't feel like heartburn at all. This was different. But he was already writing something on his clipboard. He handed me a prescription for antacids and told me to cut back on spicy foods and maybe try Yoga for stress. I didn't even bother filling the prescription. What was the point? They never listen anyway. My roommate Katie was pissed when I told her what happened. She'd been dealing with the same kind of medical bias for years. We both joked about how doctors think being fat is some kind of terminal illness that causes every other symptom in the world.

I was 13 when my mom started dating this guy named Paul. The problem was his nine year old son, Ethan. Most adults thought Ethan was perfect. He had these bright blue eyes, always said please and thank you. And teachers constantly praised him for being so well behaved. My mom would gush about how polite he was compared to other kids his age. But I saw the real Ethan. The first red flag happened during his second visit to our house. My little sister Emma was playing with her dolls in the living room when Ethan sat down next to her. I was doing homework at the kitchen table when I heard Emma start crying. I found Ethan calmly explaining to her, I'm teaching you not to scream so much. It's annoying. Emma had these tiny purple bruises on her arms where he'd been pinching her. When I confronted him, he just smiled and said, he needs to learn to be quiet. My mom brushed it off when I told her, boys can be rough sometimes. He's probably just trying to play. But it got worse. Way worse. One afternoon, I came home from school to this horrible yelling sound coming from the laundry room. I ran in and found Ethan standing in front of the dryer, which was running. Inside was our cat, whiskers tumbling around. I yanked the door open and grabbed our terrified cat. Whiskers was panting and shaking, but thankfully okay. Ethan just stood there watching me, completely calm. What the hell is wrong with you? I screamed. He tilted his head like he was genuinely confused by my reaction. I was curious how many spins it could handle before it stopped moving. I told Paul immediately. He got this uncomfortable look on his face and said, kids are naturally curious about how things work. He didn't mean any harm.

I'm done? I worked as a corporate event planner for seven years at a marketing firm. Seven years of making their events look like million dollar productions while they paid me barely more than the college interns. Every year I watched executives get custom Rolexes for Christmas while I got a gift card to target. My job was making their quarterly galas picture perfect. I'm talking ballroom lighting that made everyone look like movie stars. Catering that paired wines with every single course. Personalised name cards with gold lettering for each executive. Nobody knew was I was doing all this magic on budgets smaller than what they spent on their lunch meetings. The company funneled almost everything into C E O. Bonuses while telling me my reward was the experience. Yeah, the experience of working 60 hour weeks for peanuts while watching people who couldn't even spell my name right get promoted above me. This year was different, though. For the first time ever, I got nominated for their excellence and execution award at the annual company gala. They told me to prepare a speech. I actually cried when they told me. Maybe after seven years, they finally saw what I brought to the table. I spent three weeks making this gala absolutely flawless. The venue was this luxury hotel with chandeliers that cost more than my Car. I had the catering team practice the service twice, made sure every centerpiece was exactly 12 inches apart, and even had backup generators ready in case of power issues. One hour before the event started, the V P. Of marketing walked up to me holding this thick binder. Here's the speech you're reading tonight. He said, not even looking at me. Keep it under two minutes. We've got real award.

I had just finished my overnight shift at the community clinic, still wearing my scrubs, beat up sneakers, and my old backpack covered in pins and a small stitched tear my daughter had fixed with purple thread. I was exhausted, but I had a mission that couldn't wait. My younger brother Jake, was graduating medical school in two weeks. Our dad had promised him a Rolex when he finished, but he died of a heart attack three years ago before he could keep that promise. I've been saving for two years to make it happen myself. $27,000 in cash sitting in my checking account. I stopped at the luxury shopping plaza on my way home. The watch store had white marble walls and spotless glass counters that probably cost more than my car. I walked in and immediately felt out of place, but I approached the display of stainless steel watches anyway. I waited and waited. One saleswoman made eye contact with me, looked at my backpack, then looked away. Another whispered something to her coworker while glancing in my direction. Five minutes passed, 10 minutes. Still no one offered to help. Finally, I spoke up. Excuse me, I'm looking for a submariner. Do you have any in stock? The manager, a woman in her 50s wearing more jewelry than I made in a month, turned around. He looked me up and down. Slowly taking in my hospital shoes and wrinkled scrubs without even walking closer, she replied. Those aren't available to browse. You have to be an established client for that level of timepiece. We don't keep inventory on the sales floor for walk in.

I'd walk into places feeling hopeful, fill out applications, interview well, then get that call a few days later. Sorry, we've decided to go with someone else.

The screen was cracked, wouldn't boot up, making these weird clicking sounds. I popped it open, saw the hard drive was loose, reseated the RAM and had it running in under an hour. Eli watched me work the whole time, nodding quietly. When can you start? He asked. I told him about my record right there. Figured he deserved to know before hiring me. He just shrugged and said, everyone deserves a second chance. Some people just need it more than others. For two years, Eli taught me everything. Hardware, software, how to talk to customers, how to run a business. He paid me fair wages. Never made me feel like a charity case. Never brought up my past.

I was 26 when my mother died. I didn't cry. Not because I didn't care, but because after a lifetime of being her emotional punching bag, my heart had already broken years ago. Growing up, mom treated me like I was invisible, unless she needed someone to blame. When dad left dishes in the sink, it was my fault for not cleaning them when the bills were late. Somehow I was responsible. My older brother, Kevin got straight A's and played football. I got screamed at for bringing home a B+ in chemistry. Every family dinner was the same routine. Kevin would talk about his accomplishments while I sat there quietly eating. If I tried to share anything about my day, mom would cut me off and say something like, nobody cares about your stupid little stories. Then she'd turn back to Kevin and light up like a Christmas tree. When I was 16, she kicked me out in the middle of a thunderstorm because I forgot to take out the trash. I had to sleep in my car that night. Kevin never even asked where I'd been. The funeral was exactly what you'd expect. Kevin gave this beautiful eulogy about how mom was the heart of our family and always put her children first. I sat in the second row watching him cry real tears. Part of me wondered if we Even had the same mother. After the service, everyone went back to Mom's house. The same house where I'd scrubbed floors since I was 10 while Kevin played video games. The same kitchen where she told me I'd never be good enough every single day. That night, everyone got bedrooms except me. I slept on the living room couch. While relatives I barely knew took over my childhood room. Nobody offered me anything else. It was like I was still the family ghost. Around three in the morning, I couldn't sleep. I walked through that dark house, touching everything one last time.

I was borrowing money from friends for groceries, and my car's transmission died. The repair quote was more than the car was worth. So there I was, walking home from another failed job interview, feeling like the biggest loser on the planet. That's when I passed this garage sale in some random neighborhood. Most of it was typical garage sale junk, but sitting in the driveway was this beat up mountain bike. Thing looked like it hadn't been touched in years. Covered in dust, chain was rusty, and there was this handwritten cardboard sign taped to it that said, take it. $10 breaks sort of work. I checked my wallet. 13 bucks left to my name. I stood there for like, five minutes debating whether to buy it. Ten dollars was basically half my food budget for the week, but something told me to just do it. The lady running the sale was this older woman named Carol. When I handed her the 10, she looked at me and said, honey, you sure about this? That thing's been sitting here for two years. I told her I was sure. She shrugged and took my money. The bike was worse than I thought. Seat was wobbly as hell. One brake Lever just dangled there doing nothing. And the gears made this grinding noise every time I pedaled. But it moved. That's all that mattered. Two days later, I got a call about a job interview.

I wanted to tell him that I actually knew his teacher personally because I've been volunteering at his school every lunch hour. But instead I just stood there and took it because arguing would just make everything worse for my boy. The whole party was basically two hours of my ex wife's family taking turns humiliating me while I tried to stay invisible near the fence.

Alexis tried to explain, but Aiden refused to listen. So what exactly did you end up hearing, and what man are we talking about? I asked. Aiden pulled out a portable speaker. Listen to this. All of a sudden, a deep, gravelly male voice growled out, I love the way you tremble when I whisper in your ear. My eyes widen.

Five star passenger rating. Easy money, I think. I pull up and see him. Expensive suit loosened to tie, hair gel that could withstand a Hurricane. The kind of guy who calls waitresses sweetheart and tips with poser. He stumbles toward my car, beer in hand. First red flag. Hey, buddy. I say, no open containers. He grins like I'm an adorable toddler. It's fine. I know people. Translation I'm about to be a pain in your ass. We get maybe three blocks before he starts making phone calls on speaker loudly to people with names like Vince and Chad about closing the deal Monday. He keeps kicking the back of my seat like a bored five year old. Then out of nowhere, hey, driver, how much you make doing this? Like 40 grand. Pathetic. I keep it professional enough to pay the bills. That's when he leans forward, beer breath hot on my neck, and says, you're lucky to have me in your car. If I wanted to, I can Have your job by tomorrow. My company works with corporate for your app. Sure you do, champ. We're about two minutes from his address when he decides to really flex.

You're saying you're refusing to pay for this ride? He laughs like it's the funniest thing he's ever heard. What are you gonna do, call the cops?

I wasn't exactly the type of student who caused trouble. My grades were solid, I was in the debate club, and the only time I'd ever been to the principal's office was to drop off fundraising money. So when I was chosen to give a short speech at the school's annual assembly for Student Achievement Week, I was honoured. The topic, The Importance of Student Voices. The irony wasn't lost on me. Later, I spent two weeks writing my speech. It wasn't controversial, at least not to me. I talked about students taking pride in their school, but also about how we should be encouraged to speak up about things we think could be better. Broken lockers, outdated textbooks, the fact that our gym roof had leaked every winter for three years straight. It was respectful, specific, and full of we statements, not you accusations. Three days before the assembly, I get called to Principal Carter's office. She's sitting behind her desk. That forced smile principals use when they're about to say something you won't like. Eli, she begins, I've reviewed your speech. She taps the printed copy in front of her. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, certain parts might paint the school in a negative light. I didn't say anything untrue. I out. The gym does leak, and we do have outdated textbooks. Mine still lists Pluto as a planet. Her smile tightens. Regardless, we can't have You criticizing the school at an event meant to celebrate it. I'll need you to cut the second half of your speech. I stare at her. So you want me to talk about student voices but not actually use mine? Don't be dramatic, she says. Just focus on the positive. I refuse, politely but firmly. The next morning, an announcement goes out. Due to scheduling adjustments, my speech has been removed from the assembly program entirely. I'm furious. My friends are furious. Even a couple of teachers quietly tell me they're disappointed but can't say anything. It's the kind of small town high school where the principal's word is law and the school board only meets twice a year to approve budgets. That night at dinner, I vent to my mom about the whole thing. She listens, then asks.

Your family canceled your invitation but asked to keep the 50 thousand dollar deposit you paid. I said cancel the entire wedding. The call came Tuesday morning while I was editing a commercial in my home studio. This is Renee from Perfect Day Planning calling about Jared's wedding next month. Her voice sounded uncomfortable. I have some difficult news. Your family contacted us yesterday and asked us to remove you from the guest list entirely. They mentioned some family disagreements and said you wouldn't be welcome at the ceremony or reception. I paused my editing software. My family still sees me as the twenty nine year old college dropout who threw his life away to become a freelance videographer. What they don't know is what I actually do with all that video equipment filling my garage. However, Renee continued nervously, they also specifically requested to keep the 50 thousand dollar deposit you paid for the wedding videography package. Missus Ruth said the family had already allocated those funds to other wedding expense and couldn't possibly return them. I leaned back in my chair looking at the wall of awards behind me. Emmy nominations, industry recognition, contracts with Fortune 500 companies. My little video hobby had quietly become a 15 million dollar production company over the past past eight years. Renee, I need to ask you something important. What's the name of your wedding venue? The Riverside Manor downtown. And who owns that property? I heard papers Shuffling on her end. Um, it's listed under Sunset Holdings, LLC, right? What about your catering company? Golden Plate Catering Services. Also owned by longer Pause. Sunset Holdings, LLC, as well. Wait, what's going on here? The photography studio handling the wedding photos. Elite Moment Studio. Oh, my god. That's also Sunset Holdings. The florist providing all the arrangements. Bella's Garden Creations. That's. That's you, too, isn't it? The DJ company, the luxury transportation service. The rehearsal dinner venue.

My best friend and I have been inseparable for seven years, with movie nights every Friday, every birthday spent together. And she calls me her soul sister to anyone who will listen.

Look, when I was 12, I wasn't exactly known for making good life decisions. My crowning achievement up until that point was hiding in the bathroom for an entire gym class and convincing everyone I've been locked in by accident. So when I forgot to do my history homework, my brain naturally went, time for a bold lie. I went with the classic my dog ate my homework. Now, normally, this should have been a quick exchange.

I froze like I just been caught trying to smuggle a raccoon into an airport. I stammered out an okay and sat back down, my heart pounding. Since when do teachers fact check homework excuses all day? I was panicking at lunch. I told my best friend Derek. He immediately said, easy, just have your dog chew it up tonight. Which, yes, is logical. But my actual homework was pristine and untouched in my bag. If I used that, she'd know I was lying. So naturally, I went full C I A. Black Ops mode. Step one, I printed a fresh copy of the homework so there was no trace of my handwriting. 2. I covered it in peanut butter. Not a little. I'm talking a thick smear that could Glue a toddler to a wall. Step 3. I called in the star of the operation, my dog, Kevin. Now, Kevin is not a small dog. He's the 90 pound golden retriever who thinks paper is just seasoning for whatever food is on it. At first he sniffed the page suspiciously. Then chaos. He shredded it, drooled on it, and somehow managed to embed one of his own hairs into the pulp by the time he was done.

I worked at a mid sized electronic store. The kind that sold everything from phone chargers to two thousand dollar gaming laptops. I wasn't just decent at my job, I was good. My sales numbers were always top three in the region. Customers remembered me by name, and I had regulars who'd come in just to have me help them pick something out. That's exactly why my manager, Denise, hated me. Denise was one of those middle management tyrants who thrived on being intimidating. She had the don't talk to me before my coffee mug, the fake smile for corporate visits, and a habit of stealing credit for other people's sales. The kind of person who'd rather see the store suffer than admit someone else was better at something. The downfall started over something so small it still makes me laugh. It was a Saturday morning and an older couple came in looking for a new laptop. They were sweet, a little overwhelmed by all the tech options, so I took my time explaining specs, comparing models, and making sure they didn't overspend. I threw in some jokes about future proofing their setup and help transfer their files for free, even though that wasn't technically my job. They left happy. I thought that was the end of it. Two days later, I'm called into Denise's office. She's got that smug look like she's about to drop a bomb. Corporate got a Complaint about you, she says, sliding a printed email across the desk. I read it. It's from the older couple. Except it's not a complaint. They'd written in saying I was the friendliest and most helpful employee they'd ever dealt with, and that they'd be coming back because of him. Denise leans back in her chair, arms crossed. This is unprofessional, she's does. I blink. Being friendly. She launches into some nonsense about how I was too casual and spent too much time with a single customer, which apparently could cost the store sales opportunities. Then she hits me with it. I'm terminating your employment effective immediately. I laughed at first, thinking it was a bad joke. She slid the termination papers across the desk. She was dead serious.

Just for sleeping in? Okay, so I'm not a morning person. Never have been, never will be. My relationship with mornings is the same as my relationship with taxes. Legally unavoidable, emotionally abusive. So when I moved into this apartment with my new roommate Connor, I warned him. I said, hey man, I sleep late. I'm not dead. I'm just lazy. Don't panic. He said that was cool. He lied. It was a Sunday. I had no obligations, no work, no class, not even a fake errand to pretend to be just me. My bed and a bottle of lotion and baby oil within arms reach. A dream. So I sleep in. I wake up at a glorious 11:03 a. M. I check my phone. No texts, no missed calls, no fire alarms. Amazing. I walk out into the kitchen in my hoodie and socks looking like I thought a raccoon and lost. And Connor, shirtless, frantic, eating cereal like he's in a hostage video, just stares at me. You're alive. I blinked. Unfortunately, he quints, what were you doing last night sleeping? And this man, this 23 year old drama major who eats frozen peas straight from the bag goes, are you sure you were just sleeping? Because I didn't hear you come in. What kind of Scooby Doo logic is that? I go, yeah, because I was already home in bed doing absolutely nothing. He puts his spoon down. See, that's What someone would say if they were doing crimes. Crimes. I woke up at 11:00am and suddenly I'm the Zodiac killer. I laugh thinking he's joking. He's not. He folds his arms and starts listing behavior patterns like he's a detective on a network crime drama. You sleep late. You leave your shoes by the door like you're in a rush to take them off. You use cash sometimes. That's all sketchy behavior. Rather, I sleep late, take off my shoes and use five dollar bills. That's not suspicious. That's called being tired, clean and broke. He's like, I'm just saying, I don't know where you go at night. You could be robbing. Robbing what, Connor? My dignity. Because that's gone. I decide to brush it off. I microwave my leftover noodles and go back to my room. I think that's the end of it. It is not. Later that day, I'm scrolling TikTok and I hear him on the phone loudly, aggressively. No, mom, I'm just saying he was gone all night and now he's just pretending like nothing happened. He came out of his room looking all disheveled like he just buried something. Brother, I woke up with a cow lick. I didn't hide a body. I walk out like, hey, you talking about me? Connor turns and stares like I caught him mid murder. I mean, if the shoe.

We moved out six months ago and terminated that lease, so why was I getting notifications? I shoved my husband Tyrone awake, probably harder than necessary, shoving the screen in his face. It's just a glitch, he mumbled, rolling over like I was being dramatic. Ring cameras do that sometimes with old addresses. But something felt off about how quickly he dismissed it, so I opened the app anyway. What I saw made me wake up instantly. Our old couch was sitting right there on the screen, that hideous brown monster we'd supposedly donated to goodwill. The coffee table we'd sold on Facebook Marketplace was exactly where we left it, complete with my birthday party wine stain. But if we terminated the lease, why is our stuff still there? My voice went squeaky, which I hate, but I was freaking out. He sat up way too fast, practically lunging for my phone, but I yanked it away. Just close the app, babe. It's probably showing old footage. Except the time stamp said 302:00am. Literally right now. And I could see fresh rain droplets on the window. My chest felt like someone was squeezing it, because this meant someone had been maintaining our old place for six months. I pulled up our bank statements while he kept insisting this was technical glitch, his voice getting more desperate with Each excuse. No rent payments anywhere on our personal accounts. Which should have been good news, except someone was obviously paying. By 7:00am, I was practically vibrating with anxiety and called the property management's emergency line. After being transferred twice, I finally got answers that were even more confusing. Oh, yes, Mister Tyrone renewed the lease, she said cheerfully. He pays through his business account for tax purposes. Listed as client meeting space. Client meeting space? He worked from home exclusively. So who was he meeting? That's when I remembered Megan, my old neighbor who worked night shifts and loved gossip. She called immediately after my text. Probably thrilled for drama girl.

Last month I decided to treat my warehouse crew for my 30th birthday. We never really celebrated birthdays at work, so I figured I'd do something nice. Spent my own cash on six large pizzas from this place everyone always talks about. Cost me like 80 bucks, but whatever. I was feeling generous. I carried those boxes in during my break, sweating like crazy because they were heavy as hell. Soon as I walked through the door, people started cheering happy birthday. Someone yelled. Made me feel good, you know? Set the pizzas down in our little break room, told everyone to grab plates, and headed to the bathroom to wash my hands real quick. I was gone maybe 10 minutes, tops. Had to actually use the bathroom and then wash the pizza grease off my hands. When I came back, I expected to see everyone eating and having a good time. Instead, I saw six empty boxes. Completely empty. Like someone had licked them clean. Just crumbs and grease stains left behind. And here's the weird part. Half my co workers were standing around looking confused as hell. Did anyone get pizza? I asked, thinking maybe they put slices somewhere else. Ah, man, we were waiting for you to come back, said Tony from shipping. But when we got here, the boxes were already empty. That's when Jessica from accounting spoke up. I saw Dennis Loading boxes into his car like 20 minutes ago. Thought maybe you asked him to move them or something. Dennis? New temp guy who'd been working with us for about three weeks. Real quiet, dude kept to himself mostly. I figured maybe there was some misunderstanding, but then Dennis walked back into the break room, casual as anything, holding one lukewarm slice on a paper napkin. He walked right up to me and said, hey, man, you really shouldn't leave food sitting around like that. Anyone could just take it. I stared at him, thinking he had to be joking.

What's the worst thing a kid has done without batting an eye while taking the driving test? I've been testing kids for 15 years. I've seen nervous wrecks, cocky show offs, even one who threw up right before we started. But nothing prepared me for Jake. He walked into my office on a Tuesday morning wearing a torn Iron Man shirt and jeans that had seen better days. His mom dropped him off in an old Honda with a busted muffler. Kid looked tired, had this hollow look in his eyes that reminded me of my nephew after his parents divorced. But he was polite enough, said yes, sir, no, sir, all that. We went through the paperwork, checked his permit, and headed to the test car. Everything started normal. Adjusted mirrors, seat check, the turn signals. He parallel parked like he'd been doing it for years. Made perfect three point turns. I was thinking this was gonna be one of the easier tests I'd given all week. Then we got to the highway portion. I told him to take the on ramp to Route 9 heading north. That's when things got weird. Instead of following my directions, he took the southbound ramp. Wrong direction entirely. Jake, we need to go north, I said. He didn't answer, just kept driving. His hands were gripping the steering wheel so tight, his knuckles went white. Jake, you need to turn around at the next exit. Still nothing. We passed The first exit, then the second. Now I'm getting nervous. This kid's basically kidnapping me in a state vehicle. Son, you need to pull over right now. That's when he finally spoke. I can't go back there. His voice was shaky, like he was trying not to cry. My stepdad came home drunk again last night. Mom was working her second shift. He threw a beer bottle at me, called me worthless. Said if I ever amounted to anything, it'd be a miracle. I didn't know what to say. This was way outside my job description. Jake, I understand you're upset, but this isn't the way to handle it. He kept

I got banned from all school events for switching out all the interview questions at a beauty pageant. Thirty minutes before showtime, my best friend Carmen looked at me through the curtains, her face full of panic. I grinned at her and put two thumbs up, whispering, okay, let the show begin. The lights dimmed and the host on stage shouted, and now for the question and answer portion of the show. Let's bring out our top five contestants. Finally, my best friend Carmen didn't think she'd make it this far, but I knew she was kind and beautiful and deserved it way more than the bratty. Harper greeted us with a typical mean girl line every morning at school. Hi, losers! I held my breath as they called Carmen to the front, along with Harbor and three other girls who looked just as nervous. Harbor looked confident, but she wouldn't be soon, not with what I did behind the scenes. The host called Harbor first. Judge fished a question from the bowl while she stood there in her designer dress and perfect posture. Who is your role model and why? She started strong? The three pillars of leadership that have guided my journey are. Then she froze. Her eyes went wide. That wasn't the question she was looking for. She tried to recover, but by then the timer had run out. The host tried to push her to the Side to call up another girl, but stood there malfunctioning like a robot. These aren't the right questions! She finally snapped at the judges. The audience gasped at her outburst. I laughed on the side, thinking she deserved it after all the terrible things she did to other people at school. Harper's mom stormed onto the stage and demanded they stop everything. Someone switched the approved questions. This is sabotage! She screamed. The principal hurried onto the stage and fumbled with the microphone. We'll be having a 10 minute break before continuing the Q&A. Please help yourself with some refreshments. Crowd grew loud, already making theories as to what happened. After a few minutes, the principal called me over. Oh, no! I took in a deep breath and followed the principal towards the security room. They sat me in front of the screen and pointed. Mind telling us what you were doing at 2 p m? The footage showed me switching out the pieces of paper from the bowl very clearly. I'll tell you what she was doing. She did this to help her friend Carmen. Our

I worked at make A wish for three years, and most kids asked for trips to Disney or to meet their favourite celebrity. But then I met Ethan, a 12 year old with bone cancer who had the weirdest request I'd ever heard. I sat beside his hospital bed with my clipboard ready, expecting the usual. Maybe he wanted to meet a football player or go to Hawaii. When I asked what his wish was, Ethan looked me dead in the eye and said, I wanna see my principal get arrested. The room went completely silent. His mom laughed awkwardly, think thinking he was joking around. But Ethan wasn't smiling. He was totally serious. He told me about Mister Garver, his principal back at school. This guy was like a cartoon villain, but worse because he was real. Ethan said Mister Garver once expelled a kid for having a water balloon fight during lunch. Another time, he suspended a girl for crying during a panic attack because it was disrupting the learning environment. But what really got to Ethan was what happened to him personally. One day during gym class, right after his chemo treatment, he fainted on the basketball court. Instead of calling the nurse or his parents, Mister Garver told him to stop faking it for attention and made him clean up after himself with a mop. Ethan Never forgot that moment. Lying on that hospital bed, bald from chemo and weighing maybe 90 pounds. He looked at me and said, that man made me feel like dirt when I was already dying. I just want him to know what that feels like. Most people would have said no immediately. It wasn't exactly a normal wish. But something about the way Ethan said it made me think we could get creative. I talked to my supervisor, then the school board, then somehow got the

So I had this huge crush on Ethan from work. He worked at the auto shop next to the coffee place where I was a barista, and every morning around 10, he'd come in for his usual black coffee and blueberry muffin. After three months of this routine, he started staying longer, sometimes until my break, just talking about random stuff, like his favourite movies or how he wanted to travel somewhere warm. The thing that really got me was how genuine he seemed. He'd bring me those fancy energy drinks when I looked tired and when my car wouldn't start. That one freezing morning in February, he came over at 7:00am to jump it for free. No big deal, he said. That's what friends do. Friends kept hoping we'd be more than that. By April, we were hanging out almost every day. After my shifts, he'd pick me up. We'd drive around listening to music, sometimes grab food at that sketchy taco truck downtown. He'd always pay, saying stuff like, I got you, don't worry about it. He seemed so different from other guys who expected something back for everything. One time he told me he really respected girls who were honest and loyal. Said he hated people who played games or lied about things. I remember thinking, finally, someone who values the same things I do. Then he gave me a spare key to His apartment. I trust you, he said, tossing it to me like it was nothing. Make yourself at home. If I'm not there, I work weird hours. Sometimes I felt so special. Like this guy actually trusted me enough to have access to his place. That never happened to me before. I kept that key on my keychain, right next to my car keys. And every time I saw it, I'd get those stupid butterflies. Three weeks later, my manager, Carmen, asked if I could cover her morning shift because her kid was sick. I said yes, thinking I'd make some

My family had one rule. Marry the right gender, give us biological grandchildren. When my brother brought home Carlos, a pediatric surgeon who literally saves babies for a living, my parents smiled politely through dinner and told him to leave and never come back. Nice man, wrong parts, mother said. Can't make real grandchildren. My brother chose Carlos, and they disowned him. That night, they drained his bank accounts while he slept. They were still co signers from when he was 17. Cancelled his health insurance effective immediately. Reported his car stolen since it was a graduation gift still in their name. By morning, his medical practice received a cease and desist letter for using our family name. I even saw his baby photos in the garbage. I was 22. Watched from my bedroom window as he loaded what little he actually owned into Carlos's car at 9:00am. My parents stood in the doorway, like my father had already posted on Facebook that our family was mourning a loss. By morning, 500 people had sent condolences for my brother's death from cancer. I wanted to help, but my father pulled me aside. You walk out that door, you're dead, too. And I'll make sure you never finish medical school. Scared. But I knew what I had to do. For three years, I played the perfect son. Dated girls whose families thought the same. Pharmaceutical heiresses, senators, daughters, old money families. With the right chromosomes to continue the bloodline. Sent my parents photos of every approved girlfriend, like breeding certificates. I attended monthly family foundation meetings where my brother's name was never spoken. His face already photoshopped out of family portraits and replaced with our cousins. Meanwhile, I had a secret phone. Called my brother every Sunday. He was happy. Really happy. Carlos treated him like gold. He'd fostered three kids. Blinks the system couldn't keep together. Kids whose biological families had thrown them away like trash. Two had been abandoned at the hospital. One had lived in five different homes by age 7. I miss you, he'd say. I miss you, too.

Addison didn't just sit in the front row of our classroom. She owned it. The moment she walked into Miss Brennan's honors English class, she made sure everyone knew this was her domain. She spoke like she was reciting Shakespeare, even when she was just asking to sharpen her pencil. Miss Brennan, you forgot to collect the essays, she'd say, eyes wide with innocent but trail. She'd raise her hand to help correct someone else's grammar. She always offered to grade vocab quizzes to save you the trouble. And eventually, Miss Brennan actually let her. Addison became more than just a pet. She was like Brennan's little assistant. At some point, she moved from the front row to facing us, to being next to Miss Brennan's desk. She started handing out detentions for people talking too much during independent reading. Or taking notes on who was using their phones when Miss Brennan wasn't looking. We joked that she was part of the faculty. I caught her changing scores on the quiz stack once. Nothing major, just bumping her friends C+ to a B. When I brought it up to her, she smiled and said, you can't prove that. Then there was the time she told the quiet kid in the back, Miguel, that his poetry assignment was too weird and probably wouldn't meet expectations. Ended up not turning it in. Miss Brennan never knew. Just Gave him a zero. Then came the winter party. It was this small get together at Jaya's house. Hot cocoa, secret Santa. Nothing dramatic. Addison didn't get invited. Mostly because no one really liked her. Not even her so called friends. She found out the next day and her whole vibe changed. She was cold, dismissive. But worse, she started making trouble. She began planting things. A vape pen in another student's locker. Screenshots of fake cheating messages on anonymous Instagram accounts. Miss Brennan believed all of it. She started handing out detentions and threatening suspension. And then Addison took it too far.

I eat like a horse, but my metabolism is just crazy fast, which honestly pisses people off sometimes. I get it. It's annoying when someone can demolish a whole pizza and not gain a pound, but that's just how my body works. Janet started with the comments pretty much from day one. At first it was little things like, oh look, there goes slim. When I'd walk by her desk or during lunch, she'd be like, are you really gonna eat all that with your figure? I figured she was just being friendly in her own weird way, so I didn't say anything. But then it got worse. She'd make these comments about how I probably shop in the kids section or how I need to eat a burger.

Like, we'd be talking about quarterly reports and she'd go, well, at least someone Here. Doesn't have to worry about their pants getting tight. The breaking point came during our office potluck last month. I brought this really good pasta salad that my mom taught me how to make, and I was actually pretty proud of it. Janet walks up to the table, sees me putting some on my plate, and goes, wow, skinny girls really do eat. I thought you just survived on air and compliments.

My six year old son started coming home from daycare with scratches on his arms. And I thought it was just normal playground roughhousing. Boy, was I wrong. Every single day, my son was coming home with new marks. What started as little scratches turned into deeper gouges. Always on his arms and legs. Never his face, never his torso. Just wear clothes. Could cover them. He'd flinch when our neighbor walked their golden retriever past our house. This kid who used to beg me for a puppy, his teacher mentioned he fell outside again. But something felt off about how she said it, like she was reading from a script. He started wearing long sleeves in 90 degree weather. Refused to wear shorts, even in our own backyard. My sister swore I was just being paranoid. Boys play rough. Sarah, you can't bubble wrap him. But when my son screamed when I tried to turn off his bedroom light, my maternal instincts weren't whispering. They were screaming. So I did what any rational mother would do in this situation. I started observing his every move. Daycare drop off was the first battle I noticed. He would practically glue himself to the car door, begging me not to leave him. The daycare director just smiled that fake smile. Separation anxiety is perfectly normal at this age. But this wasn't separation anxiety. This was terror. Pure terror. I caught him practicing running around our Kitchen table one evening. Just running in circles, timing himself with his toy watch, muttering, faster, faster. I have to be faster. When I asked what he was doing, he. Just playing, Mommy. But his left eye had a slight twitch, the kind only adults get. Then came the day I'll never forget. I was folding laundry when I heard him in his room talking to his stuffed Dinosaur. His little voice was so serious. If you're very good and very quiet, she won't make you visit Max. My blood went cold. Maximum. Who the hell was Max? I tried to keep my voice casual. When I asked him about it at dinner, his whole body went rigid. The fork fell from his hand. Nobody, mom. Just. Just a game. His eyes darted to the door like he was calculating if he could run. My six year old was looking for escape routes in his own home. That night, I checked his arms while he slept. Counted 17 different wounds in various stages of healing. Some looked fresh, some were scabbing over. But that wasn't even

My landlord didn't care if everyone burned down with the building. In fact, he would have been thrilled if we did. I was holding the emergency exit door open with my foot, helping my elderly neighbor, Missus Chia, carry her garbage down to the dumpster when my rich old landlord appeared behind us. What do you think you're doing? He shouted. Missus Chia jumped, nearly dropping her bag. Taking out trash said explaining how taking the elevator down just to walk around to the other side of the building was more tiring, he scoffed. You're complaining about exercising. Anyway, this stops today. Homeless people are sneaking in through here. He pulled out a padlock from his pocket and locked the emergency exit. I looked at him, confused. What homeless people? I've been here three years and never seen any. He tugged on the lock a few times. Well, now you won't have to worry about it. Mrs. You spoke up quietly. But how do we move furniture? My grandson is bringing my new bed next week for me. He turned to her. Buy furniture that fits the elevator. Find solutions, people. He stepped into his apartment and slammed the door. I called the fire marshal the next day, hoping they'd do something about it. When they showed up, I watched from my peephole as he walked them to a completely different door, laughing like old friends. After they left, he knocked on My door. I know it was you, he said. Call them again and you're evicted. I have lawyers. You have nothing. Two days later, I tried talking to him once more in the hallway. What if there's a real fire? He smiled. There won't be. Now stop harassing me about this. With no other choice, people started using the elevator for trash bags. Bits and pieces and spilled liquid seeped onto the elevator carpet and stained the hallways. The smell got so bad that a little kid vomited inside the elevator, making it even more unbearable. Then tenants got tired of the 20 minute walk around the building to reach the dumpster. So they started leaving bags by the elevator door. It's just until morning, they'd say. But the pile grew. By week two, there were dozens of bags rotting in the hallway. The landlord walked past them every day without a word. Wrote

My sister Becca has this thing where she turns every single life event into some kind of competition with me. When I got my first job, she suddenly decided she was pre med. When I bought my car, she magically had enough saved for a brand new one the next week. Everything had to be bigger, better, more dramatic than whatever I was doing. So when I found out I was pregnant last year, I was actually excited to tell my family. I thought maybe this would be different. Maybe becoming an aunt would make Becca grow up a little. I called my mom first and she was crying happy tears through the phone. Then I called Becca. Her response, oh, wow, that's great. Actually, funny story, I've been trying for months but didn't want to say anything until I knew for sure. Three days later, she announced she was pregnant, too. And somehow she was already showing more than me, even though I was supposedly further along. My mom immediately started gushing about how they'd be little cousins growing up together. But I could tell Becca was already planning something. The whole pregnancy, she went up to everything I mentioned, morning sickness. She was hospitalized for hyperemesis. I posted a bump photo. She posted a maternity shoot that looked like it cost more than my rent. When I told the family I was having a boy, She waited exactly two hours before announcing she was having twins. Twins. Of course, my baby shower got moved because it conflicted with her gender reveal party. My due date came and went and I finally gave birth to my son, Jake, after 14 hours of labor. I was exhausted but so happy. My mom came to visit the next day and spent maybe an hour before saying she had to leave because Becca was having contractions. Here's where it gets ridiculous. Becca went into labor the day after I got home from the hospital, the exact day my phone started blowing up with.

My girlfriend Emma had been acting weird all week, coming home late, being super secretive with her phone and just generally being cold toward me. We'd been living together for about eight months and things had been pretty solid until recently. Thursday night she comes home around eleven PM smelling like Cologne that definitely wasn't mine. I'm sitting on our couch watching Netflix and she just walks past me without even saying hi, go straight to the bathroom and takes a shower. When she comes out, I asked her where she was, just out with friends. She says, not even looking at me. Which friends? I ask. You don't know them? That's when I knew something was up. Emma's not the type to be secretive about anything. She usually tells me way too much about her day, down to what she had for lunch and who said what at work. Friday comes around and she's texting someone constantly during dinner. Every time I try to look at her phone, she angles it away. Finally, I just ask her straight up, are you seeing someone else? He gets all defensive immediately. Why would you even ask that? You're being paranoid. But she never actually says no. Saturday morning I wake up and she's already gone. Left a note saying she went to her sister's place for the weekend, except her sister lives in another state and Emma never mentioned any trip. I try calling Her around noon and it goes straight to voicemail. That evening, she comes back home with this guy I've never seen before, all decent looking, wearing a nice watch. They're both laughing about something as they walk up to our apartment. I'm watching from the window and my stomach just drops. They come inside and Emma acts like everything's normal. Hey, babe, this is Ryan.

I've been pulling 60 hour weeks for three months straight. When Derek called me into his office right after I'd finished saving our biggest client from jumping ship. We need to discuss your performance issues. You're doing too much making everyone else look bad. It's disruptive. I stared at him. I just saved the Denver account. That's a million in revenue. Derek smug smile widened. Exactly. You're a show off. You think you're indispensable. You're just a mid level analyst who doesn't know his place. He slid a paper across. Your salary is being reduced by 15% effective immediately. Consider it a lesson in humility. From now on, stick to your basic job description only. Nothing more. That's a direct order. I looked at the signature line in shock and couldn't help but ask. So you want me to do less? Exactly. Know your place. I said just one word. Understood. Monday morning started with Derek's assistant calling about the client presentation due at noon. Sorry, presentations aren't in my basic analyst job description. Derek grabbed the phone. Get in here now. You told me to stick to my job description. Basic data analysis only. Click. He had to stumble through it himself, sweating bullets while the clients exchanged confused glances. Tuesday, the weekly department meeting arrived. I used to run these, preparing all the slides and talking points. Meeting coordination. Isn't in my job description. I told Derek that morning he had to wing it in front of 20 people, getting half the agenda items and mixing up the quarterly numbers. People started texting each other during his rambling. Wednesday was beautiful. The CEO's assistant called asking for the efficiency report I'd always prepared that exceeds basic analyst duties. Derek said I was doing too much. She paused. But you've done this for three years. Derek was very clear about me knowing my place. CEO himself showed up at Derek's office an hour later. Through the glass walls, everyone watched Derek gesturing frantically while the CEO's expression grew colder. Thursday, our biggest client called asking for me specifically. I'm only authorized to do base.

My husband, Jake, makes about three times what I make as a nurse. He's always been the one buying me clothes, jewelry, my phone, even my car. I thought it was sweet at first, like he was taking care of me. We've been married four years and this was just our normal last month. I wanted to go back to school to get my master's degree. The program cost about $15,000 total, which I could pay for with loans. But Jake said absolutely not. He didn't want me taking on debt when we were trying to save for a house. I brought it up again a few weeks later because the deadline was coming up. I explained how the degree would help me get promoted and make more money in the long run. Jake got annoyed and said, we already talked about this. When I kept pushing, he finally snapped, look, I pay for everything in this house, your car, your clothes, that expensive face cream you use, your phone Bill, everything. You contribute basically nothing financially. So you don't get to make big financial decisions like this. I just stared at him. He'd never talked to me like that before. I make decent money as a nurse, but most of it goes to groceries, utilities and my student loans from nursing school. He pays the mortgage and car payments because he insisted on it when We got married fine, I said. If it's all your money, then I won't use any of it. The next morning, I took off the diamond earrings he bought me for our anniversary, then the necklace from Christmas. Put my wedding ring in my jewelry box, too, since he paid for that. I grabbed clothes from the back of my closet that I bought myself before we got married, old scrubs, a few t shirts, jeans with holes in them. I left my iPhone on the kitchen counter and dug out my old flip phone from 2,019. Still worked just barely. Jake came downstairs and saw me putting on my ancient sneakers with duct tape on the side. What are you doing, he asked. Getting ready for work. I'm taking the bus since you paid for my car. He looked confused. This is ridiculous. Just wear your normal clothes.

But every single family gathering turns into this crazy interrogation session about what we're naming the kid. My mother in law, Janet, is the worst. She'll literally corner me by the kitchen sink and be like, just give me a hint, honey. I promise I won't tell anyone. Meanwhile, she's already told half the neighborhood that I'm having twins because she misheard something at dinner three weeks ago. Then there's my sister Emma, who keeps suggesting names like Braxton and Nivea because apparently normal names aren't creative enough anymore. And don't even get me started on Kyle's brother who keeps pushing for family names. He wants us to name our kid after their dead Uncle Mortimer. Like, dude, it's 2025, not 1825. The breaking point was last Sunday at my in law's house. I'm trying to eat my potato salad in peace when Janet goes, I have a feeling it's going to be Theodore. Doesn't she look like she's carrying a Theodore? And then Emma chimes in with, no way. That baby is definitely a Paisley. Meanwhile, Kyle's cousin starts going on about how we should honor the family tradition and Kyle's dad is nodding along like this is some kind of democracy vote. I looked at Kyle across the table and He had this look like he wanted to crawl under the furniture. That's when I decided enough was enough. So I stood up, put my hands on my belly, all dramatic like, and announced, you know what, you guys have been so invested in this, I think you deserve to know. Everyone got quiet real fast. We've narrowed it down to three names, I said, making eye contact with each person. For a boy, we're thinking either Bartholomew, Nebuchadnezzar or Gaylord. And for a girl, it's between Brunilda, Bertha or Methuselah. Kyle nearly choked on his ice.

I figured probably some soccer mom texting while backing out her driveway. When I pulled up, I saw this beat up Honda Civic sitting halfway through the fence, front bumper buried in Mrs. Henderson's prize winning rose bushes. Driver door was hanging wide open and this lanky 20 something kid was pacing around the car like he was having a panic attack. The second he saw my patrol car, he sprinted over waving his hands above his head. Officer, thank god you're here. I didn't do it. I swear on my mother's grave I didn't do it. I stepped out already reaching for my notepad. Kid reeked of panic, sweat but no alcohol. His eyes were clear. Pupils normal size, not high either. Alright, son, just calm down and tell me what happened. That's when he said the most ridiculous thing I'd ever heard in my career. My dog drove the car into the fence. I stopped writing and looked at him. Come again. My dog, Bruno. He somehow shifted it into gear and crashed it. The kid was pointing frantically at this massive golden retriever sitting in the driver's seat, tongue hanging out, looking proud as punch. I rubbed my forehead. Your dog drove your car? Well, not drove exactly, but Yeah, I just ran inside to grab my wallet, left the engine running because I was only gonna be 30 seconds. Bruno must have jumped up front and stepped on something. I was about to start the whole drunk driving test routine when the kid kept talking. Look, I know it sounds crazy, but Mrs. Henderson has cameras. She's got that ring doorbell thing and it points right at her driveway. You can see everything. Now, I was curious, in 17 years.

I was 15 when my cousin Layla came to stay at our house for a few months. Her parents were getting divorced and things were pretty messy. Layla was identical to her twin sister Lena, but they were complete opposites. Layla was quiet, loved painting and spent hours in our spare room just drawing these amazing pictures. Lena was loud, crazy, and once got suspended for dying her hair bright green just to annoy her math teacher. Even though they looked exactly the same, everyone could tell them apart. It wasn't hard if you knew them. Layla would sit in the corner at family dinners, barely talking. Lena would be standing on her chair telling jokes and making everyone laugh. They were like two different people in the same body. For three months, Layla and I shared my bedroom. We became super close. She taught me how to paint these weird abstract things with purple rivers and yellow skies that didn't make sense but somehow looked amazing. We had this inside joke where we'd whisper dragonfly dreams to each other. When adults were being boring, she kept journals everywhere, little notebooks filled with sketches and poems about feeling invisible. Then one day in March, Layla said she was going home early. Her dad picked her up on a Tuesday morning. She hugged me tight and said, thanks for everything. I. I watched her car. Drive away, thinking I'd see her again soon. Three weeks later, we got invited to Layla's birthday party. Mom and I drove over, excited to surprise her. But when the door opened, I knew something was wrong immediately. The girl standing there wasn't Layla. Everyone else acted normal, her parents, her friends even, and my mom. They all said it was Layla celebrating her 16th birthday. But I knew it was Lena. She stood differently, talked louder, kept flipping her hair. Lena always did that annoying hair flip thing. I whispered dragonfly dreams to her when we were alone by the cake table.

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the center of attention for 5 minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance, Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day, the one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding, I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up, he said. And I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself and I just can't deal with that stress on my wedding day. The line went quiet for like 10 seconds and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now you're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. He's basically family. I tried. To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice, hoping he'd change his mind. He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, she says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted like 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewelry. The cat.

So my boyfriend Jake and I had been dating for 8 months. His friend Emma had been part of that group since high school. She was one of those girls who was super close with all the guys. And honestly, I didn't think much of it at first. She seemed nice enough and Jake always said they were just friends. But over the past few weeks, I started noticing things, little things that made me uncomfortable, like how she'd always sit next to Jake when we hung out in groups, how she'd touch his arm when she laughed at his jokes, how she'd text him at weird hours about random stuff. The beach trip was supposed to be fun. It was Jake's birthday weekend and we'd planned this whole day with about 10 of his friends. Everyone was supposed to drive themselves or coordinate rides beforehand. The morning of the trip, Jake got a call from Emma. Her car, I was in the shop and she needed a ride. No big deal, right? Jake said we could pick her up on the way. When we got to her place, she came bouncing out in this tiny bikini that left nothing to the imagination. She threw her beach bag in the back and climbed into the passenger seat of Jake's car. The passenger seat where I usually sat. I was standing there like an idiot. Holding my own beach bag while she was already buckling herself in and adjusting the mirrors. Jake looked at me and shrugged like this was totally normal. Sorry, babe, she called. Shotgun, he said with this awkward laugh. I squeezed into the back seat, feeling like a third wheel in my own boyfriend's car. The whole drive there, Emma was playing her music, talking about inside jokes I wasn't part of and basically acting like I wasn't even there. When we got to the beach, things got worse. She'd ask Jake to put sunscreen on her back. She'd splash him in the water while I was setting up our spot. She'd lean against him when we were all sitting in the sand talking about memories from high school. That always seemed to exclude me. The breaking point came when we were all playing volleyball.

My ex husband, Jake, had this perfect plan mapped out. He'd work his fancy job while I stayed home with Mia. Since she was born seven years later, I barely remembered who I was before diapers and goldfish crackers. When Jake came home that Tuesday night, he didn't even sit down. Just stood by the kitchen counter, still in his work clothes, and said he wanted a divorce. No warning, no fight beforehand, nothing. He said he'd been thinking about it for months. I felt like someone punched me in the stomach. But then he kept talking. He said since I didn't have a job or income, he figured I'd want him to take me a most of the time. You know, so she could have stability. He even had this whole speech ready about how I could see her every other weekend and Wednesday nights. That's when it clicked. He planned this whole thing while I was home making lunches and helping with homework. He was probably talking to lawyers, making sure everything worked out perfect for him. I asked him if he met someone else. He got all defensive and said it wasn't about that. But he wouldn't look at me when he said it. Just kept staring at his phone. The next few weeks were hell. Jake moved into his brother's spare room, but still came by every morning to help Mia get Ready for school, acting like nothing changed. Meanwhile, I'm googling divorce lawyers at 2:00am and crying in the target parking lot. My mom kept calling, saying I needed to fight for custody, that any good mother would. But here's what nobody understood. I was exhausted. Not just tired. Completely burnt out. Seven years of being the only parent who knew where the Band Aid drawer was or what Mia's teacher's name was. Jake never once took her to a doctor's appointment, never knew her friends names, never did bedtime without me. But suddenly he wanted to be dad of the year. So when our lawyers met, Jake looked shocked when I said I agreed to his custody plan. His lawyer even asked if I was sure. Like they expect

My seven year old daughter came home from school last Tuesday with this massive folder of stuff, not homework, not art projects, a freaking catalog, 20 pages of overpriced junk that nobody actually needs. Mom, we have to order something for the school fundraiser, Emma said, bouncing around the kitchen. Mrs. Allen said every family needs to participate. I flipped through the catalog, 30 dollar wrapping paper that you can get at Dollar Tree for two bucks. Cookie dough for 40 dollars that makes 12 cookies. A 60 dollar candle that probably smells like vanilla and false hope. Prices were absolutely insane. But here's the thing, Emma's school had been struggling. They'd cut art programs, music class was down to once a week and the playground equipment looked like it survived a tornado. So I figured, okay, I'll buy something small to help out. I ordered a 25 dollar pizza kit because Emma loves making pizza and it seemed reasonable. Pulled out the form, wrote the check, sent it back with Emma The next day. Two weeks later, Emma comes home with another catalog, different company, same overpriced garbage. Mrs. Allen's apparently told the kids that the last fundraiser didn't meet expectations and they needed to do another one. Then another catalog the week after that and another one. By October, we'd gotten six different fundraising catalogs, six. Emma kept coming home stressed because Mrs. Allen's would Announce in class how much money each family had contributed so far. She'd literally read out names and amounts during morning announcements. The Johnson family has raised $87 for our school. The Martinez family has contributed $115, like it was some kind of competition. Emma started begging me to order more stuff because she was embarrassed that we'd only bought one thing. Other kids were bragging about how their parents bought three or four items from each catalog. I finally snapped when the seventh catalog came home.

Right. This happened in 2014, and no one was arrested until 2022. The story is pretty twisted. This is Donna Adelson, the grandmother, but we'll get back to her in a minute. This is her daughter, Wendy Adelson. And this was Wendy's husband, Dan Markel. Wendy and Dan created a life for a while until it just no longer worked. They got divorced, but then they ensued in a custody battle. You see, Wendy wanted to move 370 miles south of Tallahassee to southern Florida with their two sons. Dan was a law professor at Florida State University, and he absolutely refused to relocate. This was going to prevent Wendy from leaving with the kids. In comes Donna again. Apparently, Wendy's mother, Donna, wanted to help with the situation. This is her son over here, Charlie Adelson. Apparently, Donna master minded this murder for hire plot utilizing her son's ex girlfriend. Here's Charlie. Here's his girlfriend, Catherine. Here's Catherine's baby daddy. Tuto was friends with Louis, and these two were part of the Latin Kings gang. These two were apparently hired to take out Dan. Wendy and Donna's problem. On July of 2014, those two stalked him, followed him to his house, and ended up taking his life in his garage. Now, Dan's unaliving went unsolved for nearly a decade. It wasn't until 2022 that they were finally able to link this unaliving to the son Charlie. Adelson at that time it was found that Charlie and his then girlfriend Katie had hired these two to do the plot. Louis took a plea deal and is serving 19 years behind Bar. Tutu was found to be the trigger man, serving life behind bars. Charlie and Katie were also sentenced to a life behind bars. But let's not forget Donna and all of this who hated her son in law. Donna also avoided arrest for nearly a decade. She was being investigated, although she clearly denied that she had anything to do with this. Basically she let her son take the fall. But in November of 2023, Donna was arrested in the Miami International Airport. She had a one way ticket to Vietnam, which she later admitted that she was aware that they have a no extradition policy. She waited for quite some time for her trial, but on September 4th the judge handed down the verdict and she was found guilty. And she wailed and cried for nearly two minutes as the judge had to send the jury out while she collected herself. It was found that she had orchestrated this entire murder for hire plot, gotten together $100,000, which she came from a pretty affluent family and area anyways, and that she indeed did deserve to be behind bars.

Michaela had called emergency services saying that she found her infant daughter covered in blood. When police arrived, they found the daughter infant in her bassinet. She was indeed covered in blood and they also saw that she had bite marks all over her ears, hands, feet, legs, arms. They also found the infant's twin brother in near the same condition. They asked the parents if they had any kind of rat problem or knew of any rat infestation. And to that they both admitted that they do have field rats that get in the house and they've been dealing with that for a very long time. Problem is here is that these bite marks didn't look like they were something that just happened recently. How were these bite marks happening on these children and these parents didn't realise and they didn't realise until they came in and just saw the infant covered in her injuries. There was also the problem that they allowed the children to live there knowing that they were having an infestation problem of these field rat. So these two were arrested but as you can guessed, they are out on bond.

So then came a report to CPS. Now, I'm not entirely sure if this part is completely factual, but in the show the act, Ed shoved all kinds of muscle relaxer type of pills down Gypsy's throat. This would keep Gypsy in a more controlled state during questioning from the CPS officer. Now, the thing is, is that Deedee thought that she was keeping Gypsy in a child like state. But Gypsy was still growing up in her mind. And so at night time, she would sneak on the computer and she would seek out life experiences and information that she was missing at home. This is also when she would sneak sweets and food that she wasn't allowed to have via oral route when her mother was awake. This is also how she ended up meeting her boyfriend. And believe it or not, it was through a Christian dating site. Now, these two men on a Christian dating site in 2012, Late at night, they would convene with their late night talks. That got really racy, by the way. The two conjured up a plan to finally meet. Gypsy got her mom to take her to a movie theater and he was supposed to show up and just kind of bump into them and make a good impression on the mom. It didn't really happen. They didn't get to sit together in the movie. Theater. But Gypsy snuck off to the bathroom and so did he. And this is when they had their first actual encounter. Again, when they were leaving the theater, he tried to impress the mom, who was only more turned off by him. And the two knew that they were not gonna be able to spend time together in front of Gypsy's mom. So they continued their late night chats. And through these late night chats, it would come up how Gypsy felt like she was kind of just trapped. Nick wanted to help her get out, so he comes up with this plan of unaliving Deedee. Now, ultimately, Nick made it look like it was a break in, and he ended up stabbing Deedee multiple, multiple time in her bed as she lay sleeping. Now, Nick and Gypsy fled the scene, and they were on the run for five days. They definitely were no smooth criminals. They were on surveillance cameras at gas stations. You could track their Greyhound bus ticket. They stayed at a hotel together. And in subsequent interviews from Nick, by the way, he says that those were the best five days of his entire existence. In fact, it was even Gypsy's bizarre Facebook post on June 13th of 2015 that said, the B is dead that really tipped people off. Now, as I said before, Gypsy pled to second degree unaliving and 10 years, and Nick got sentenced to life in prison. But neither of their Stories stopped there, but this is way too long. So you're gonna have to go to part two to see what she did while she was in prison, what happened to her, and where it leads to now.

It's not a big deal, baby. I don't think that's a good idea. It's very difficult to manage an entire bar and 6 high top tables, especially when it gets busy in here. Maybe for one of the bartenders that you picked up off the street, but for someone who has experience, it's not that hard. Okay, well, maybe that's something that we'll revisit in like two or three months when you've kind of got the hang of everything again.

See, this is why you guys work in restaurants because you can't follow simple instructions. Jim, if you want to talk about following instructions, the only reason why this whole thing is happening is because you selected the wrong item on Doordash so you wouldn't have to pay the difference. That's not true. It was a mistake. Okay, well, that's fine. I told you that you could reorder if you wanted to, but we can't give you something that you didn't pay for.

So you can eat here if you want, but if you make any more comments about what my servers are wearing or what my employees are wearing, you're done. Well, I just don't know if I can do that.

What can I help you with? Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you about the way your employees are dressed. I just think it reflects poorly on your company. Okay. Um, so what is it about them that you have a problem with? Are you joking? Are you. No, I'm just surprised you haven't gotten any more complaints about them. First of all, they look like drag Queens. The hair done up, the makeup done up, the cleavage. Okay, I'm not done. They're basically half naked in here and I'm not bringing my husband in for his birthday for a reservation we've had for two weeks when all he's gonna do is get distracted by girls that can't put it away. Okay, ma'am, with all due respect, this sounds more like a personal issue. The fuck do you mean personal issue? This wouldn't be an issue at all if your employees weren't throwing their boobs around. And how does one exactly throw their boob around? You know what I mean? Listen, this might get you sales with the men, but I think it's a disgusting business practice.

This 5 pound dog who has been whining in your face for the past 10 minutes and looks like he's about to shit in your hand, he relieves your anxiety? Yeah, and the only reason he's whining, by the way, is because he hasn't had his 11:45 snack yet. And whose fault is that? Um, it's not mine. I don't think I've ever met a dog who needs an 11:00am snack either. It is yours, actually, if we hadn't been having this conversation for the past 15 minutes, precious could be halfway through his meal right now. Okay, well, as much as I hate to deny precious his 11 45 am snack, unfortunately, we still can't have you sit inside.

It's literally y'all's job. You wouldn't want to be there that late. Yes, ma'am, it is our job. Uh, from the time that the salon opens until the time that the salon closes, then we like to go home to our families. Okay, well, I see appointments that run over all the time. You're telling me that you've never had to be there until 8:30 to finish styling? Oh, yes, ma'am. You know, things absolutely happen that cause appointments to run over, time wise, but that's why we try to be as on top of things as possible now, because we know that hair isn't 100% an exact science. And that's why we don't book appointments past a certain time in the day that we know take up an excessive amount of time. Here's a solution. Why don't you have them start later in the day so that they can take me and it's not too long of a day for them? Well, we are pretty far booked out, so for me to make that happen, you would have to wait about six months before we could get a stylist to come in later than their scheduled day. Your comprehensive skills are lacking. I asked for the next two weeks. Yes, ma'am. And I told you that the only day that we would be able to do it would be a Saturday. Again, I told you why that wouldn't work. Can you just ask the stylist? Does anyone want a balayage and a fashion color at 5:30 this week at night? No. This is a joke, right? For a million bucks. I'm sorry, ma'am. You are useless. I'll go elsewhere.

I'm assuming that it's just us two clients that you have. Is it just the two of them that you have or I thought you had a third one, right? It's just the two of them, but she's processing and when she's done, Siri will need to rinse and blow dry her because I will be busy working on you. Yeah, see, as I was saying, Siri's assistance is needed. Let Siri do me and you can be the one to rinse and blow dry that client because, because what if Siri is working on me? Then you're not working on me, which means you don't need her to blow dry and style your other client. You can do it. I just want you to know that Siri hasn't even been licensed for a year yet, whereas she has been doing this practically as long as Siri's been alive, you know? Uh, so that's why there's a difference in the prices because there's a clear difference in the skill set. So are you okay with that? I only have medium brown hair. It's a retouch. Not rocket science and certainly not worth $400. Sorry, Karen, can you go make sure that she knows she has a client?

Thank you for calling the salon where I work at. How can I help you? Hi. I'm wanting to get a color service done with you. All okay? Yeah, absolutely. What kind of color service are you wanting done? Well, my hair is very dark brown. I just don't have a brown wig. Pretend it's dark. But I'm wanting, like, a solid platinum blonde balayage, hardly any blue, and then either blue or teal pops of color throughout. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, that sounds so pretty. We could absolutely do that. Um, when are you wanting in, though? Well, I'm pretty open throughout the week. Um, so anything within the next two weeks? Probably around 5:30. Um, we don't have anything after 5. Would you be okay with doing a Saturday? No, thank you. The weekends are my time, so I want them for myself. I'd rather just do it after work. Yeah, I totally get it. Uh, but unfortunately, we do not take large color services like that if it's after 4:00. So, unfortunately, due to your frame of time that you would be needing in, we would only be able to do Saturdays. Well, after a long week of working hard, you know, the weekends are my days off. I really just want to unwind. So why can't you do 5:30? Well, we close at 8:00, and color services like that tend to take anywhere between four to sometimes eight, maybe nine hours, even. Um, so that Would mean that you and your stylist could potentially be here way past closing. Okay, that's fine by me. I anticipated it would take a while. I don't care if I'm there till midnight. Okay. Yeah, we love your enthusiasm, but unfortunately, none of the stylists here would be willing to be here that late.

Okay, well, in many different ways. For one, do you do great work whenever you're in pain? Like, if you go to work and you're sick, are you probably gonna get a lot done that day, or are you going to do the best that you can do? Probably not. I'd be too distracted by not feeling well. Okay, so same with me. This chair alleviates my pain, therefore making me a better stylist because I can focus more on the hair in front of me rather than the back pain that I'm in from bending down for such a long amount of time. Also, when I'm bent over, I'm going downward. I'm bent downward, so the haircuts slant downward. This chair allows me to be level with your head so I can cut in a straight line. Oh, why didn't you just say so instead of calling me short? Okay, well, for the second time, no one called you anything, and you never asked. You just called me lazy. No need to get snippy. It was an innocent mistake. Can you just hurry up? Sure. Okay. And you're done. Let's go get you checked out. Okay. Um, can I come back in? About 10 weeks. Great.

Oh, well, I've only ever seen women who do hair and are about to have a baby sit down. So I guess I'm just confused as to why you're being lazy then. Okay, so I'm not being lazy. I'm just working more efficiently for myself. Um, normally when I do your hair, I'm, I'm hunched over like this while standing and that really takes a toll on me physically. So.
