And if we play our cards right, we can use April Fool's Day as a hall pass. We're not actually together, but we can pretend we're together as an April Fool's Day prank just for today. And if anybody raises a flag, we'll say surprise. How is that that we're pulling this prank off exactly like this, just sitting a little closer than we normally are. What? Nothing. What? You had sex? I did not. I did not. Okay. What? Nothing. It's just, I noticed your hand touch teams at roll call. Is that how you think sex works? Aha.

And you won't believe what he had to say. How are you? Good, man. How you doing? How did you get, how did you get on the highway? I was coming out of trail. Why? Oh, alright. Just what's, what's going, motorcycle run. Oh, that's what I knew something was going on. I'm like, there's nobody on the, on the highway. Yeah, like that was weird. Can you just start? Yeah. Yeah, Thank, thank you. Alright. Some gloves, huh? Huh? Yeah, some gloves. Haha. How far out are they? Just past the William Floyd. Oh, alright. I'm driving Uber. My passenger is getting arrested. Hey, bro, turn that off. Okay. No, I'll keep recording. Thank you. Yeah, it's my right. Don't record me. You got me. I, I will. Look, you're a police officer on duty. I can record you. Turn it off and I can do it, man. Just the butt, bro. What are you arresting me for? I'm recording it in case anything happens. Yeah. Roll K9 this way. Please. Bring the k nines. I don't care, man. Okay. I know my rights. Hey, I hope so. I know, I know what the law is. I know the law. I'm an attorney. So I would hope I know the law. And an Uber Driver, you want my bar card? Yeah, I work at the courthouse. What courtroom you work in? Um, you work in 3 17. 3, 17 in our 200. I've never seen you there. I've never heard of this law that you're not allowed to record the police anymore. It must be brand new. I just recently passed it. So well, here's your license. We're gonna wait for a K9 because I don't know if he might have dumped something under the seat and you don't want us to look. If you threw something under the seat, it still has nothing to do with me. What's his indicator? If he smells something, I don't know what he does. Some are passive, some are aggressive. Shocker. All of a sudden there's probably cause to search my car. This cop just made the biggest mistake of his life. In September 2021, cops pulled over Clifford Owensby, a paraplegic man for tinted windows and requested a K9 free air sniff. Owensby said he could not exit the vehicle due to his disability and what happened next is shocking. I can't step out the car, sir. I'm a paraplegic. I got help getting here. You have to be out of the car. I do not get out of the vehicle, sir. I cannot step out. I'm a paraplegic. I cannot. Come on. I'm a paraplegic, sir. Come on. Come on, bro. Come on. Step out of the car. I cannot step out of the car. I Cannot step out of the car. You're getting out of this car so you can cooperate and get out of the car. I will drag you out of the car. Get out of the car. What are you doing, bro? Dude, you're making this worse. I'm a paraplegic, bro. I'm trying to tell you that I got help getting in the car. Y'all can hurt me. Y'all can hurt me. Get out the car. That's cool. I'm a problem. Get out the car. Get out the car. Somebody help.

On the other side of the wall, her husband heard the noise, but instead of getting angry, he felt this uncontrollable thrill. Roy never thought that this quick moment of happiness would come at such a crazy price. Born into a rich family, Roy could have picked a wealthy and stable marriage thanks to her looks and status. But money and luxury meant absolutely nothing to her. She wanted a real connection. Deep in her soul, Roy loved literature and fell head over heels for the writer Jack at first sight. Pretty soon, Jack fell deeply in love with this smart and gorgeous woman. But reality completely crushed all their dreams. Roy's parents suddenly hit major money problems. Needing cash fast, they plan to sell off their daughter's dowry. Roy was forced to marry James, this older guy, not knowing that this decision would drag her into a total nightmare. James was a business partner of Roy's parents. He was obsessed with her from the moment they met. Even though Roy felt nothing. She had no choice, couldn't fight this marriage. But love can't be forced. After the wedding, there was only awkward silence. Roy grew distant and cold. Two years passed like that. Later, Roy ran into Jack again. Now a famous writer with tons of fans. But blinded by love, Roy didn't care about any of that. She threw herself into Jack's Arms without thinking twice, not knowing it was all part of James's carefully planned trap.

Can you take it off of me? This veteran was riding with his daughter on the back when they made a huge mistake by pointing at a cop car. We're getting pulled over. We're getting pulled over behind. What? I tried to tell you, man. I tried to tell you, but what happened next was unbelievable. What's going on with your tag? Hold on, I got music going. I'm just trying to give you these. I ain't going nowhere. Just put them in the ignition. You're fine. What's going on with your tag here? Oh, I was taking pictures earlier, so I folded it up. I got all my stuff for. It's insured. I got you. That's my dad. I don't know how to do this, man. I've never been pulled over with my gun on me. Can you take it off of me? Right here. Is it loaded? Yes, it is. It's in a holster. If you just take the whole holster. Perfect. I tried to tell you. I was, like, hitting. Yeah, I know. I had music going. Where'd you serve? I was in the army for four years. Y'all have a good one, okay? I appreciate you guys. You do currently have a California driver's license. You just don't have a physical copy on you at the moment. That's my preferred method of identification. And this is. It's a cat collar. I'm currently identifying as a cat. Fair enough. Uh, the information here on the tag, I'm assuming belongs to you. The boyfriend? Yeah. That's so rude. I hope you know I'm recording. Well, wasn't my intention to offend you, but he just identified as a cat and you're wearing a Harris Waltz T-shirt. So forgive me if I came to a conclusion that you guys are involved in some sort of a homosexual arrangement. I'm not mad that you think we're together, but you're using gender language. Besides, I'm not his boyfriend, I'm his owner. Okay, well, look, we can do this the hard way if you like. I can have this car towed. Cause last I checked, a cat is not licensed to operate a motor vehicle in the state of California. We can have animal control come get you, take you to a shelter where you're owner can retrieve you for a fee of $70. After you're given the necessary immunizations, which do include a rabies shot, possibly even spayed or neuter, whichever you prefer. Identify with uh. Is that what you guys want to do here? What should we do? I don't know. I don't have $70. Sir, I can also, uh, request that a mental health care professional come down here on scene and do an evaluation of you. Because you're considering letting him take a rabies shot. Rather than just give me an ID, use some manner so I can give you your ticket and move along. Take a look at This video, it shows a 12 year old out riding his bike in an upscale neighborhood here in Southern California last week. He comes up on an 80 year old woman who immediately has words for him. Get the hell off the sidewalk! She pushes him off the sidewalk and then. Please don't touch me. Why did you just hit me? Want me to hit you again? What the fuck is wrong with you? That's right. She apparently hits the kid. But it doesn't end there. When the boy's mother comes out, the old lady doubles down on her story. She just hit me. Uh huh. She just hit me. He tried to run us down on the sidewalk. I did not. And. And lie to us. I have a video. It's a great thing that there's a camera strapped to his chest. Good. Come on, boy, just get it on. Let me see it. The mom had apparently told the boy to ride on the sidewalk because he was recently almost hit by a car. The sidewalk Karen, as she's been dubbed, is 80 year old Susan Garcia. She told local media she felt helpless and scared. But after seeing the video, police charged her with assault.

What are you talking about? I have appendicitis, mom. I had Katie drive me here this afternoon. I was in so much pain, I could barely move. I called you and dad. Neither of you picked up. Elizabeth, I'll come to see you once your father gets home. Benny can't stay home alone, and the hospital scare him. Your father should get back in about two hours. Can you hang on until then? Don't let them do any procedures on you until I get there. Mom, are you serious right now? Excuse me? Ben is 12, mom. 12 years old. He can stay home alone. He's not a little baby anymore. He can entertain himself. He doesn't need to be connected to you at the hip all the time. Or tell him to grow the hell up and just come to the hospital. If it was Ben in the hospital, not me, you'd be here in a heartbeat. You'd drop everything, leave work, leave anything. Elizabeth, how dare you talk to me that way? How dare you be so selfish? Have some respect, mom. You don't understand. You don't respect me. You don't care about anything that I love. You only care about Ben. Do you even love me, mom? Oh, Elizabeth, you haven't noticed a single thing about my life in years. You haven't even bothered to care. Mom, you haven't noticed that I have a girlfriend? Mom, we've been dating for a year. Now, we went to prom together, but you make me leave early to pick up Ben from a sleepover because he forgot his iPad at home. My girlfriend and I got into the interview recently. It's on the school website. But you never even watched it. Elizabeth, please let me talk. I'm packing a bag right now. I'm going to bring Ben to his friend's house and head to you. No. All you do is talk, and all I do is listen. I'm done. Mom, I want you to hear me. Please, Mommy, hear me. I'm listening, Beth. I'm listening. I hate myself. I feel like I'll always be nothing. You've made me feel like I'll forever be nothing. Like I'll never matter. And honestly, maybe I won't ever matter. I've spent so much time adjusting to what you need me to be, what you expected of me. I stopped even caring if I liked myself. And I don't. I hate myself. And I hate that all I do is please other people. Beth, I'm on the way right now. Please just wait until I get there. We can talk, okay? Actually, no, I will listen. I will. I promise. And you talk. I'm sorry. I know I should have said it sooner. Yeah, you're right. You should have. And it's too late for sorry. At least this way, you can finally put that college fund of mine towards Ben's dreams like you've always wanted to. Elizabeth, what are you Talking about. What are you doing? Elizabeth? Elizabeth? Elizabeth, please answer me. Beth, please pick up the phone. I'm five minutes away. Mommy. So sorry.

I guess your little girlfriend made sure of that, huh? Of course she'd go into labor today on my birthday. What a coincidence. Are you serious right now? You think Anna planned this? She's going through it right now. The doctor said they don't know if she'll be okay. Oh, please. That girl has always had a flare for drama. She does this every stinking time. Every time I try to see you, something urgent comes up. I haven't seen my sweet boy in months. Mom, you really think she's faking this to make me miss your birthday? Are you actually that jealous of her? I see right through her. She's been trying to pull you away from me since the moment she met you. Last time you missed dinner because of period cramps.

You changed the day you met her. You stopped coming over. You didn't show up for the family cookout. You said you were tired. But I know it was her.

The doctor said Anna's fate is uncertain, and you're talking about a dinner? You were my baby first. All I wanted today was a hug from my son. One picture, one memory. You think your little family matters more than the one that raised you? That is the most selfish thing I've ever heard. You're evil. You want me to leave the woman I love? Well, she's fighting for everything. Just so you don't feel left out. Cantina. Ask. Bring Robert. Help me cook. My son for choosing his girlfriend over his own mother. Tell him.

I had to take her there. Oh, my god, dad, I didn't mean for that to happen. Don't give me that crap. You know your mother has. You knew what you were doing when you did that, and for what? Some freaking cake? Anna is in labor! They Don't know what will happen. I had no choice. There's always a choice. And you made yours. Don't call me dad anymore. It's Peter to you now. Dad, no.

Your mom called me asking if I knew where you were. I told her you were in my house, in the bathroom, just to cover for you. But seriously, where are you? It's been a day now. Elio. Your mom's freaking out, and honestly, so am I. She called the police. I haven't told them that I lied for you. I keep telling her you're here, but I have no idea where you are. Please come home. I'm getting really worried. I asked my favorite astrology app, Astro App, for advice and it said that I'm a cancer, so I can get really emotional when I feel abandoned. It told me to take deep breaths and focus on grounding myself so I can stay calm and clear minded while waiting to hear from you. Elio, it's been a week. Everyone saying you're missing. Like actually missing. Your mom's been crying non stop and they filed a police report. Where are you? What's going on, Ello? It's been a month now. They still can't find you. I don't even know what to tell people anymore. I got a cat to help with the loneliness, I guess. I named him Charlie. Figured you'd like that. Wish you could see him. She's really sweet.

I keep hoping you'll walk through the door before she's born. Ello, it's been two years. I know that sounds insane, but part of me still thinks you're coming back. I can't move on from this.

He's the love of my life. And I'm finally getting married. I asked for star rings so you'd be here with me in some way. I miss you more than ever right now. Ilio. It's been five years. I don't know what to say anymore. But I'm still here. They closed your case, the police. No one's looking for you anymore. But I'll never stop. I'm thinking of searching for you on my own, but in secret. Oh, and I'm pregnant. It's a boy. I'm naming him Ilio, after you. Hey. Wow. I didn't even realize we're still having this conversation. It's been seven years. My son's been born. Look. I think he looks a bit like you. He's as cute as you were. Or maybe that's just me imagining things. Wish you could see him. Hey, Elio. It's been 11 years. He's turning four today. Time flies, doesn't it? Feels like yesterday when I last saw you. He really admires you, you know. I always tell him how great you were as a boyfriend. He says you're still alive, that we're so connected. That's why I feel like you're still around. But I don't know. Sometimes I lose faith in you coming back. I wonder if he's right. I still feel you somehow, Ello. It's been 14 years. My new boyfriend tells me I need to move on. Says I'm holding on too tight. But my son, he still believes you're coming back. He's only a kid, but he has more faith than I do by now. It's been 20 years, Elio. Wow. My boy's nine now. He's getting so big. And guess what? I'm pregnant again. With a girl. She's due in four months, and I'm naming her Jula. Like your sister. Speaking of, your sister moved back in with your parents. She's not doing well. She barely speaks to anyone. It's like everything fell apart when you left. Elio, it's been 25 years. I built the house we dreamed of. Remember that? I also got divorced, though. He cheated on me. Now it's just me, Elio, Julia, and the cat. Still waiting for you, I guess. I miss you more than I can put into words, Elio. You have no idea. Every single day. Bria. The fuck you mean I died?

My brother's wife, Diana, discovered her ultimate weapon the day she lost her first pregnancy. If someone questioned her spending, she'd clutch her stomach and call them insensitive. If anyone in the family shared good news, she'd leave the room wailing that their happiness was triggering her grief. If my brother asked her to help with anything, she'd collapse on the couch claiming the stress could cause another loss. The manipulation quickly went from tears to total destruction. First, Diana got my mom's 60th birthday party canceled by claiming the pink decorations triggered her loss. Mom spent her milestone birthday comforting Diana instead. When my cousin announced her pregnancy, Diana screamed that we were rubbing fertility in her face and claimed the shock caused her to have a panic attack. My cousin hid her entire pregnancy in shame. Then Diana wanted a 70 thousand dollar Mercedes, but my brother said no. So she staged a total breakdown at the dealership, wailing about needing a safe car for her rainbow baby and threatened to divorce if my brother didn't buy it. She didn't spare me either and went all out during my wedding planning. Diana called all my vendors claiming my flower choices would trigger miscarriages, posted on wedding forms that I was a baby killer, and demanded I change my date because it was near her loss anniversary. When I refused. She told family members that my selfishness had caused her to lose twins, and I know it might be hard to believe, but she went even further. I was four months pregnant and had managed to hide it from everyone except Diana, who'd noticed my subtle changes. One morning, she ambushed me at a doctor's appointment with an offer that made my blood freeze. I know you're pregnant, she said calmly. Here's what's going to happen. You're going to tell everyone you're carrying a baby for me as a surrogate. You'll give birth, hand the baby to me, and I'll finally be the mother. Everyone pities me for not being. I laughed, thinking she was joking, but she wasn't. If you refuse, I'll tell everyone you've been mocking my miscarriages throughout your pregnancy. She showed me her phone with drafted emails to my employer about my workplace harassment regarding her infertility, and even had screenshots of edited text where I called her an infertile bitch. She'd been planning this for weeks. I smiled sweetly when she saw how horrified I was and added, besides, you can always have another one. Standing there with my hand protectively over my bump, realizing Diana literally wanted to steal my child, I felt rage unlike anything before. I knew Diana's weakness was her need to maintain her victim story at all costs. She'd already sent me those fake texts and threatened emails, not knowing she was handing me evidence. So I did Something simple. I scheduled a meeting with my brother at his office, saying I needed to discuss the surrogacy arrangement Diana had proposed. When he arrived, confused, I broke down crying and showed him Diana's threatening text about taking my baby. I'm scared she'll hurt herself or the baby if I don't give in. She keeps saying this is her only chance at motherhood. My brother's face went white. He checked the time stamps on her threats and said, wait, these are from yesterday morning when she was with me at the mall. The realisation broke him. His wife had been plotting to steal his sister's baby while shopping right beside him. My brother spent three days processing everything before deciding to confront her on Mother's Day, Diana's favourite stage for sympathy. Whole family would be there, including my cousin, who'd hidden her pregnancy, and my mom, who'd lost her 60th birthday Celebration. I arrived late, seven months pregnant now and unable to hide anymore. Diana's eyes locked on my belly and she began explaining how my visible pregnancy was triggering severe cramping. Classic Diana, already spinning my presence into her trauma. That's when my brother pulled out his phone. I have something to say. Diana tried to force my

You ask too many questions. Just come. No, I'm in camp, too. Yeah, but mine is summer school, and that's more important than yours. Well, mine is still more important than chick fil A.

I know how mom made you. Thank you very much. Bro, you're so pressed. Unlike your nose. That thing is the opposite of flat. You can't talk. Your nose is like a bridge. I'd like to use you as a bridge and step on your face. What happened to you? You never text anymore. You never talk anymore. Ever since you went to dumb college.

It's so stupid. It's like you packed up your bags, clothes and double chin and moved out. You're already ugly at home. Why make everyone else hate you somewhere else too? Oh, and you, Take it so seriously. We're siblings. We are not supposed to be nice. That's not really true, Mark. I don't care. I hate you. I never won't hate you. I hate me, too.

Where did you hear that date? It was in the note with Dad's watch. The watch you said was destroyed. Emma, where are you right now? Still at Jessica's. Her mom's about to drive me home. Number? Go to Aunt Claire's instead. Don't come home. You're scaring me. What's going on with these texts from Dad's number? Someone is trying to manipulate you. Your father died in that accident last month. Then why is his watch here? Why does someone know about July 15th? Your father's former partner must have gotten access to his personal effects. What partner? You said dad worked alone. I needed to protect you from certain aspects of his work. There's another text. Ask about the offshore account in the Caymans. Don't respond to any more messages. They're trying to get information. Information about what? What was dad involved in? Your father was an accountant for some powerful people. He found discrepancies. Criminal discrepancies. Was dad in danger? We're in the car now. Jessica's mom is acting strange. She keeps checking her mirrors. Is she taking you to our house or to Claire's? Neither. We're heading toward the lakehouse where the text said to go. Emma, that's not Jessica's mother. The real Carol has a scar on her wrist. She's wearing long sleeves. I can't tell. Ask to use her phone. Say yours is dying. She refused. Said her battery is low, too. Try to get a look at her wrist. Find An excuse. I asked her to check the time. No scar. Mom, who is this woman? Listen carefully. When she slows down at the next intersection, unlock your door and run. She just locked all the doors from her control panel. Is there anything in the car you can use as a weapon? Jessica's field hockey stick is in the backseat. I'm 10 minutes from the lakehouse. Is she still heading there? Yes. She just got a call. She's speaking another language. Sounds Eastern European. Your father's files exposed an international money laundering operation. Dad was just an accountant. How did he get involved in this? He was recruited specifically because of his skills. He didn't know what they were hiding. She's pulling over at the convenience store. Says she needs cigarettes. This is your chance. Get out while she's inside. I can't. She took the keys and told me she'll be watching through the window. Check the glove compartment. Is there anything useful? There's a gun, mom. A real gun. Don't touch it. It could be a setup. She's coming back. She's talking to someone outside the car. Take a photo of them. Discreetly, if you can. Done. Sending it now. That's Andre Kozlov. He worked with your father's firm. We're driving again. They're taking me to the lakehouse. The watch, Emma, is there anything unusual about it? The back has a small SD card taped to it. I never noticed before. That's what they want. Your father must Have copied the evidence. Should I destroy it? No. It's the only leverage we have. It's evidence of their entire operation. We're at the lakehouse. There's a black SUV waiting. I'm two minutes away. Can you see who's in the SUV? It's Mister Peterson from Dad's office. The one who spoke at his funeral. He's the one who recruited your father. He's been leading this whole operation. She's making me get out of the car, stall, ask questions, keep them talking until I get there. Peterson says he just wants the watch and we'll be safe. He's lying. They can't leave witnesses. He's showing me a badge. FBI. Is that possible? Huh? Boost for part three.

I was 12 when a man in a blue pickup truck pulled up next to me while I was walking home from school. He asked if I wanted to earn $20 helping him move boxes. My parents had always warned me about strangers, but $20 seems like a fortune to a kid who got $5 allowance. The the moment I got in his truck, I knew I'd made a terrible mistake. He immediately locked the doors and started driving in the opposite direction of where he said we were going. When I asked where we were headed, he told me to shut up and sit still. He drove for what felt like hours to a small cabin in the woods. No neighbours, no cell towers, nothing but trees. He dragged me inside and tied me to a chair in what looked like a basement. The smell was awful, like something had died down there. For the first two days, he barely spoke to me except to bring stale bread and warm water. I cried constantly, begging him to let me go home. He just stared at me with these cold, empty eyes and said my parents probably hadn't even noticed I was gone yet. On the third day, he made a mistake. He left his phone on the table while he went upstairs to make himself lunch. I could hear him moving around in the kitchen above me. Rope around my wrists, Had loosened slightly from struggling, and I managed to work one hand free. I grabbed his phone and called the first number I could think of, my mom's work number that she'd made me memorize for emergencies. When she answered, I whispered as quietly as I could, mom, I've been kidnapped in a cabin somewhere. There are tall pine trees everywhere, and I can hear a train in the distance. Before I could say more, I heard his footsteps coming down the stairs. I quickly put the phone back and got my hand back in the rope just as he appeared. He looked at me suspiciously, but didn't seem to notice anything different. What I didn't know was that my mom had immediately called the police while staying on the line. They traced the call and started searching for cabins near train tracks in our area. Meanwhile, she kept calling his phone every few minutes, hoping I'd answer the next morning. He seemed agitated, kept looking out the windows and pacing around the cabin. I realised later that police helicopters had been circling the area, getting closer to finding us. He started talking about moving me somewhere else, which terrified me. That afternoon, he went outside to load something into his truck. I heard him talking to someone on the phone, getting angry. While he was distracted, I noticed he'd left the basement door unlocked. This was my chance. I quietly climbed the stairs and saw him through the window. Still arguing on the phone by his truck. The front door was about 15 feet away. I knew I had to be smart about this. If I ran straight out, he'd see me immediately. Instead, I crawled on my hands and knees toward the back of the cabin. There was a small window near the floor that looks like it might be big enough for me to squeeze through. I managed to push it open and wiggle through, scraping my arms and legs on the frame. Once outside, I ran as fast as I could toward the sound of the train tracks. I figured if I could reach them, I might find help, or at least know which direction LED back to civilization. My legs felt like jelly from being tied up for days, but pure adrenaline kept me moving. After running for about 10 minutes, I heard dogs barking in the distance. Then I heard voices calling my name. It was the search and rescue team my mom had called in. I screamed as loud as I could and kept running toward the voices. A police officer

Maybe when I find out who you are, you can introduce me to her. You can ask her right now and she will say yes. How can you be so sure? I'm too scared to ask her. Don't worry. She is nice. Okay. Good night, mystery girl. I'm going to get some sleep. Good night. What? I don't get a message today. Ah. Does someone miss me? In your dreams. I was just surprised how my crush since middle school hadn't messaged me today. I have a question for you. Or ask away. How could you have loved me for so long if we haven't spoken ever? You are handsome. The way you talk to people. You are such a kind soul. Polite. You make everyone laugh. You are a gentleman. I always knew you are what I always wanted. Now I really wanna know who you are. Patience. Hey. Hey. Can I admit something to you? Sure. I'm not interested in Violet anymore. Really? How come? She's beautiful. So beautiful that I was too scared to even go near her. That's the issue. She's perfect in every way. But I have fallen for someone else. Someone who I do speak to. Someone who understands me. Someone without a name or a face, but someone who loves me. The day you find out who I am, I Hope we will be together. Me too. Mystery girl. Can I confess something to you? Sure. What's up? I think it's time to tell you who I am. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

I didn't take your Legos. Yes, you did. Oh, wait, never mind. Brody had them. Told you. I don't care. Do you know where Brody is? No, why? He usually sleeps with me, but he isn't coming in, and I'm scared. Bro, he's a dog. He's probably eating. You're so mean for no reason. Thanks. I'm trying my best. I hate you. I love you, too. You drive, right? Obviously. I'm 17. Okay, drive me back home from camp. Uh, why? Because I'm done with camp. Why can't mom do it? Because I want you to drop me off at chick fil A. Why? You ask too many questions. Just come. No, I'm in camp, too. Yeah, but mine is summer school, and that's more important than yours. Well, mine is still more important than chick fil A. Not even you're more important than chick fil A. Cute. Come get me. I told mom you're waiting. She's coming to get you. Bro, I hate you. I love you, too. Shut up! You're so stupid. I'm home. Where were you? I picked up dad from the airport. Okay, I don't care that you're home. The door is locked, so we don't have the key. Oh, my bad. Eat some celery. You're so fat. What? Let me speak it in your language. Oink, oink. Excuse me, you little jerk. You're excused. Why'd you tell mom? Ugh, take a joke. Okay, I hear You singing in the shower. Such a ear murderer. Yeah, that's right. Turn off the shower and read these texts. So tell me, what the fuck is your problem? I don't know. But I know that your problem is your singing. And your problem is your attitude. Oh, good one. Got me shaking and quaking in my boots. Yeah, if you could afford boots, bro. What? I'm literally a child. Of course I can't afford boots. Take a joke, Mark. Learn to make one. I know how mom made you. Thank you very much. Bro, you're so pressed. Unlike your nose. That thing is the opposite of flat. You can't talk. Your nose is like a bridge. I'd like to use you as a bridge and step on your face. What happened to you? You never text anymore. You never talk anymore. Ever since you went to dumb college. Whenever I mess around about something, you take it seriously. I'm just kidding. Obviously. Hello? I know you can read this, you hole. You wouldn't know. You're barely 8 years old. I'm literally 13, bro. I hate you. I love you too. Happy birthday. I don't care. You don't even come over on holidays anymore. Why would I respond to you? Okay, why are you so different? It's so stupid. It's like you packed up your bags, clothes and double chin and moved out. You're already ugly at home. Why make everyone else hate you somewhere else too? Oh, and you, Take it so seriously. We're siblings. We are not supposed to be nice. That's not really true, Mark. I don't care. I hate you. I never won't hate you. I hate me, too. Oh, it's my fault, right? My fault that you're gone. I'm in high school now. I understand now that you were insecure and I truly was a jerk. Brody died today. I read our texts and cried. Boys aren't supposed to cry. But you told me. It's okay. I love you. Do you still love me, too?

So if I were you, bro, I would be careful. He raised an eyebrow and explained that he was only there to get free food and to try to make me jealous enough to give her another chance. It was the stupidest thing I had heard. I looked over at my ex's face was super red with embarrassment and realized that it was actually true. I felt a serious rush of ego boost, but at the same time, I felt something unexpected too. Like, dude, call me stupid. But I felt pretty touched that she would go this far just to try to win me back. It definitely wasn't the best way to win me back, but definitely creative. So I told her jokingly that if she really wanted me back, she should try showing up here alone for another month to prove that she really meant it. I walked off to finish the rest of my shift. After that, she really did show up every day with a book or journal sitting at the same booth waiting for my shift to finish. I didn't even really talk to her much and she still came around. Weeks went by and on the last day of the month, she walked into Waffle House with a huge smile on her face. I walked over with her usual order and sat beside her in the booth. She asked me, If I would finally be her boyfriend again. I smiled back and said, absolutely not. I reminded her that she cheated on me with several guys and one of them was my best friend. She picked up the glass of water and thought about splashing it all over me. Instead, she splashed water on her own face to wake herself up and left, angrily ripping up one of the menus in the restaurant out of frustration before walking out the front door. The entire angry scene was crazy cute, like, ah, there goes my little Harley Quinn. I grinned and told my manager that I was finally quitting. I chased after her and apologized, saying that I wanted to get back at her a little for the horrible mess she put me through before I unzipped my jacket and wrapped it around her head to help her stay warm. After seeing water still drip down from her hair, I took her home that night and we talked about setting new boundaries if we wanted the relationship to work better this time. To this day, we're still together and no longer the toxic kids we used to be. Also for our prenup, we had a fun photo shoot at that same Waffle House, forever reminding us of our ridiculous and petty days.

I work at a Waffle House as one of the cooks and my ex girlfriend likes to come around and set up each of her dates there only when she knows I'm working. It had been four months since our breakup, so I didn't really understand why she would waste effort coming around and showing off that she could easily land a guy. It really bothered me at first watching her laugh and enjoy each date just like how we used to. I even thought about burning their food or putting something weird in. I settled for making their food extra salty for fun. After seeing the 3rd and 4th guy, I got used to it and just treated them like another customer with no connection to me. Eventually, my ex girlfriend settled with a guy I like to call Beanie based on the black and green beanie had he liked to wear on every date. They visit Waffle House about twice a week after class. I wasn't really suspicious about their relationship or anything until I was given a different shift. They ended up changing their meal time to match my schedule. That's when I started to really think about why they kept coming around and why they needed to go out on a date while I was there at work. Like, was I really that great of a chef here? So during my break one time, I decided to Walk over and ask them why they kept coming around to have a date specifically. While I was on the clock, my ex girlfriend sipped on her Sprite and asked, what do you mean? Are you saying we're doing this on purpose? I nodded and said, yeah, that's exactly what I was implying. She sighed and leaned back in her seat, crossing her arms before looking up at me and asking, are you just jealous? I sighed, feeling like I wasted my time and said, why would I be jealous when I'm the one who broke up with you in the first place? Her mouth flung open to argue back, but I tired my attention to Beanie and said.

I was supposed to be home an hour ago. Immediately, he was off of me and my phone was in my hand. No one wants cops at a party. My exchange with my mom went a little something like this. Hey, mom. Super sorry that it's so late. I hope I didn't worry you. I lost track of time. I thought you were going to stay with Teresa tonight after your party. Oh, crap. Yeah, mom, I'll switch out the kitty litter tomorrow by 9. I'll make sure I'm dropped off early so it's done before the garbage is collected. Can you grab me some tampons at the store tomorrow? My would be assailant is looking rather uncomfortable. I'll throw on a robe and be there in five. You ready for me to scream? My mom proceeded to yell some rather nonsensical things at me over the phone. As I'd requested. With tampons garbage. Was that whoever I was concerned about was near me, potentially being able to hear the phone conversation or read texts. Kitty litter meant I needed to leave ASAP. 9, meaning without cops, my would be assailant was very uncomfortable, and I left the room without a word. My mom yelling on the phone and an overly exaggerated wince on my face. I reconnected with my friend and told her what happened. She walked me out with her boyfriend and ended Up telling me that same guy had told her he thought we'd really connected. In one of my info. In the end, I lied. But I would have been assaulted if I hadn't. It's a system I'm glad to pass on to my daughter.

So if I were you, bro, I would be careful. He raised an eyebrow and explained that he was only there to get free food and to try to make me jealous enough to give her another chance. It was the stupidest thing I had heard. I looked over at my ex's face was super red with embarrassment and realized that it was actually true. I felt a serious rush of ego boost, but at the same time, I felt something unexpected too. Like, dude, call me stupid. But I felt pretty touched that she would go this far just to try to win me back. It definitely wasn't the best way to win me back, but definitely creative. So I told her jokingly that if she really wanted me back, she should try showing up here alone for another month to prove that she really meant it. I walked off to finish the rest of my shift. After that, she really did show up every day with a book or journal sitting at the same booth waiting for my shift to finish. I didn't even really talk to her much and she still came around. Weeks went by and on the last day of the month, she walked into Waffle House with a huge smile on her face. I walked over with her usual order and sat beside her in the booth. She asked me, If I would finally be her boyfriend again. I smiled back and said, absolutely not. I reminded her that she cheated on me with several guys and one of them was my best friend. She picked up the glass of water and thought about splashing it all over me. Instead, she splashed water on her own face to wake herself up and left, angrily ripping up one of the menus in the restaurant out of frustration before walking out the front door. The entire angry scene was crazy cute, like, ah, there goes my little Harley Quinn. I grinned and told my manager that I was finally quitting. I chased after her and apologized, saying that I wanted to get back at her a little for the horrible mess she put me through before I unzipped my jacket and wrapped it around her head to help her stay warm. After seeing water still drip down from her hair, I took her home that night and we talked about setting new boundaries if we wanted the relationship to work better this time. To this day, we're still together and no longer the toxic kids we used to be. Also for our prenup, we had a fun photo shoot at that same Waffle House, forever reminding us of our ridiculous and petty days.

An exhausted woman stood there clutching her purse, thanking mom over and over for babysitting. Behind her, a girl about 11 with dark hair hung back, clearly uneasy. Take all the time you need, mom purred in a voice I'd never heard before. The second their car turned the corner, something in Mom's face shifted into pure predator. She grabbed the girl's wrist hard enough to leave marks and dragged her toward Daniela's room. Welcome home, baby. The girl's confusion turned to fear. My name is not Daniela. It's Katie, she, I whispered. The sound of Mom's palm hitting her face made me flinch. You are Daniela, Mom shrieked. Everything accelerated into a nightmare. Mom commanded Katie to undress, but when she shook her head, mom grabbed the Scissors from Daniela's desk. Katie tried to bolt, but mom caught her by the hair. I watched frozen in horror as she cut through Katie's clothes with violent precision, humming Daniela's lullaby. Katie stood there exposed and sobbing while mom forced Daniela's tiny dress over her head. Bathroom became a torture chamber. Mom dragged the screaming girl in while I watched in horror. Through the mirror, I watched mom slather bleach on her hair. I want my mommy, she wailed. I am your mommy. Mom, god gave you back to me. In one desperate moment, when mom turned for more dye, Katie scooped bleach and smeared it across Mom's eyes. Mom's Scream was inhuman as she clawed at her face. Katie sprinted out and yelled for help. I flew downstairs and dove into the pantry with my phone. I whispered frantically to 9, 1, 1 while Katie sobs mixed with Mom's rage above us. Those minutes waiting for sirens felt like hours. When they finally broke down Daniela's door, they found mom sitting calmly on the bed, brushing both Katie's hair and the dolls. My two danielas have finally met, she announced it's proudly. Katie threw herself at the officers while mom fought like a wild animal, screaming, don't take my babies again, even as they wrestled her into handcuffs. The little girl's mom placed a restraining order on our family and Mom's been institutionalized 8 months now. Last time I visited, she grabbed my hand and whispered, I forgive you for sending Daniela away again. She smiled and for a moment I thought I saw a glimpse of mom I had before the crash until she mentioned another patient had Daniela's exact laugh. After that, dad and I cleaned out Daniela's room together and donated everything, including that horrible doll.

She was only fifteen. And her mother wasn't just stealing insulin money. The woman had been using Sarah to pay for drugs. The pharmacy cashier later told me Sarah came in with different men every week, always looking terrified. Mrs. Putin pulled me aside and whispered, this girl has been through hell. Are you sure you can handle this? I looked at Sarah sitting on my couch, still clutching that old backpack with everything she owned, and knew I couldn't abandon her. The custody process took six. Once Sarah's mother contested it, not because she wanted her daughter back, but because losing custody meant losing her income source. I had to hire a lawyer I couldn't afford and take time off work I desperately needed. During the court hearings, more truth came out. Sarah had been supporting herself since age 12. She he'd Learned to forge her mother's signature, manage her own medical care, and even had a secret job cleaning offices at night just to afford insulin. The judge was horrified. Sarah's mother got five years for child endangerment. I got temporary custody, then permanent guardianship when Sarah turned 16. My ex had started telling people I was probably a predator for taking in a teenage girl. School was another battle. Sarah tested three grade levels behind in everything except math and science. The guidance counselor wanted to put her in remedial classes, but I saw how brilliant she was. I hired tutors with money I didn't Have and sat with her every night until 2:00am studying. The breakthrough came junior year when Sarah aced the state chemistry exam. Suddenly, colleges were calling. Harvard, Stanford, Johns Hopkins. They all wanted her. But Sarah almost didn't apply anywhere. She was convinced she didn't deserve it, that someone like her couldn't become a doctor. I had to literally drive her to the guidance office and watch her submit applications. Medical school was worse. Sarah called me at least twice a week, having panic attacks, convinced she didn't belong. Other students came from doctor families with connections. Sarah came from nothing. That was eight years ago. Sarah graduated valedictorian, got a full scholarship to medical school and just finished her residency. She's now an endocrinologist helping other diabetic kid.

So if I were you, bro, I would be careful. He raised an eyebrow and explained that he was only there to get free food and to try to make me jealous enough to give her another chance. It was the stupidest thing I had heard. I looked over at my ex, whose face was super red with embarrassment, and realized that it was actually true. I felt a serious rush of ego boost, but at the same time, I felt something unexpected too. Like, dude, call me stupid, but I felt pretty touched that she would go this far just to try to win me back. It definitely wasn't the best way to win me back, but definitely creative. So I told her jokingly that if she really wanted me back, she should try showing up here alone for another month to prove that she really meant it. I walked off to finish the rest of my shift after that. She really did show up. Every day with a book or journal, sitting at the same booth waiting for my shift to finish. I didn't even really talk to her much and she still came around. Weeks went by, and on the last day of the month, she walked into Waffle House with a huge smile on her face. I walked over with her usual order and sat beside her in the booth. She asked Me if I would finally be her boyfriend again. I smiled back and said absolutely not. I reminded her that she cheated on me with several guys and one of them was my best friend. She picked up the glass of water and thought about splashing it all over me. Instead, she splashed water on her own face to wake herself up and left angrily, ripping up one of the menus in the restaurant out of frustration before walking out the front door. The entire angry scene was crazy cute, like ah, there goes my little Harley Quinn. I grinned and told my manager that I was finally quitting. I chased after her and apologized, saying that I wanted to get back at her a little for the horrible mess she put me through before I unzipped my jacket and wrapped it around her head to help her stay warm. After seeing water still drip down from her hair. I took her home that night and we talked about setting new boundaries if we wanted the relationship to work better this time. To this day, we're still together and no longer the toxic kids we used to be. Also, for our prenup, we had a fun photo shoot at that same Waffle House, forever reminding us of our ridiculous and petty days.

I work at a Waffle House as one of the cooks, and my ex girlfriend likes to come around and set up each of her dates there only when she knows I'm working. It had been four months since our breakup, so I didn't really understand why she would waste effort coming around and showing off that she could easily land a guy. It really bothered me at first, watching her laugh and enjoy each date just like how we used to. I even thought about burning their food or putting something weird in. I settled for making their food extra salty for fun. After seeing the third and fourth guy, I got used to it and just treated them like another customer with no connection to me. Eventually, my ex girlfriend settled with a guy I like to call Beanie, based on the black and green beanie had he liked to wear on every date. They visit Waffle House about twice a week after class. I wasn't really suspicious about their relationship or anything until I was given a different shift. They ended up changing their meal time to match my schedule. That's when I started to really think about why they kept coming around and why they needed to go out on a date while I was there at work. Like, was I really that great of a chef here? So during my break one time, I decided to Walk over and ask them why they kept coming around to have a date specifically. While I was on the clock, my ex girlfriend sipped on her Sprite and asked, what do you mean? Are you saying we're doing this on purpose? I nodded and said, yeah, that's exactly what I was implying.

The finding out was biblical. I show up to practice Thursday night at the regular time, and my three bandmates are sitting in a circle without their instruments, like they're about to hold an intervention. Lead singer says, we need to talk about the band's future. Battle of bands is in 10 days, and apparently we need to level up our image. That's when I know it's the drummer's girlfriend standing in the corner holding a bass. My bass, actually, that I let him borrow last week. She's holding it upside down. Lead singer looks at me. Look, you're great and all, but she has the look we need. She's been learning bass for, like, two months. Two months? I've been carrying this band for three years. But sure, let's get the girl who thinks a bass has six strings. They vote 3 to 1 to replace me right there with me watching like I'm getting voted off a reality show. The guitarist, who still can't play an F chord cleanly, actually says, it's nothing personal. Nobody's looking at the bassist anyway. Might as well have someone pretty back there. Nobody's looking at the bassist. I wrote half our songs, but okay, Brad, tell me more about how music works. The drummer's girlfriend tries to be nice. You can still come to the show if you want to support us. Support them. Sure. Let me buy a ticket to watch you play my bass badly. Sounds like a Dream Friday night. I don't argue, don't yell. Just say okay if that's what you all want. The lead singer seems surprised I'm not fighting back. Probably expected tears. Sorry to disappoint. They're already talking about keeping the band name and the set list for battle of bands. Acting like everything's normal. Planning tomorrow's practice like I was never even there. Like I'm already a ghost. Guitarist mentions they'll see me around and I just nod, give them a smile that doesn't reach my eyes, walk out quietly. I can hear them talking about stage positions as the door closes. How she'll look right in the back, how the judges will love having something nice to look at. They think this is over. They think I'm just going to crawl away and cry. That's cute. I'm sitting in my car in the driveway and my brain starts doing math. Tomorrow's practice. They kept saying see you at practice tomorrow to each other. But wait, that's my amp the guitarist uses because his sounds like a dying cat. My mixing board that makes our lead singer not sound like he's through a kazoo. The mic system I bought with birthday money. The cables, the stands, hell, even the extension cords are mine. I check the battle of bands registration on my phone. The song list they submitted. Breaking Chains I wrote that. Midnight Drive wrote that in my bedroom. Phoenix Rising? That's literally about my ex boyfriend. I have the notebooks. With the original lyrics in my handwriting. The van we use for gigs. Mine. Well, technically my mom's, but she lets me use it. And then it hits me. This is my dad's garage. Dad only lets them practice here because of me. I text him, hey, the band just kicked me out for not being pretty enough. He texts back immediately. Are you kidding me? They're banned. I'll change the garage code right now. My dad's the best. They kept saying, see you at practice tomorrow. They actually think they're still practicing here tomorrow. In my dad's garage. With my equipment, playing my songs. The delusion is actually impressive. Next day, five PM, I'm home.

Vincent stands up, his chair scraping loudly. This is ridiculous. Chloe, don't listen to this. Sit down. Mom's voice cuts through the room. He sits. I swipe again. Here's the pawn shop receipt for Grandma's engagement ring. The one that went missing in 2013. You blamed me for that, too, remember? Said I probably sold it for drug money. I turned the phone toward Mom. Vincent's signature, April 2,013. On for $800. My cousin Jordan whispers, holy shit. Vincent's face is red now. That's not my signature. Anyone could have forged that. The pawn shop had security footage, too, but they only keep it for seven years. Uncle Mitchell is staring at Vincent with this look of pure disgust. You son of a. Wait. I interrupt. There's more. I swipe to the next photo. This is the insurance claim Vincent filed in 2014 for a break in that never happened. Claimed $12,000 in stolen electronics and jewelry. Mom's hands are shaking. We split that money. You said we needed it for the roof repair, right? I say, except I pulled the insurance investigation report. They suspected fraud, but couldn't prove it. The serial numbers Vincent provided, they didn't match any purchase items. He made them up. Vincent's already moving toward the door, but Devon's blocking the exit. My husband's sick, 6 foot 3 and played college football. And this? I show her. The final photo is the police report I filed last month. Statute Of limitations just expired for prosecution. But insurance fraud doesn't expire for civil suits. I'm suing him for the $12,000 plus interest. The insurance company is joining the suit, too. Mom looks at Vincent. He's ail sweating, eyes darting toward the exit. She stands up slowly. Get out, Diane, let me explain. Get out! He practically runs from the restaurant. The table erupts in chaos. Uncle Mitchell's yelling. Aunt Rachel's crying. My cousins are all talking at once. Mom walks around the table and wraps her arms around me. She's sobbing into my shoulder. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I invited him tonight so she could finally see who he really was. Mom filed for divorce three days later.

I set my fork down, smiled and said, that's exactly why I invited him tonight. Growing up in Portland, my stepdad, Vincent, controlled everything, the thermostat, the grocery list, who mom talked to on the phone. When I was 16, he convinced mom to kick me out, saying I was stealing from them. I wasn't, but mom believed him and I spent my senior year couch surfing between friends houses, finishing school while working at a gas station. Vincent had this way of making everything seem reasonable. Chloe's been acting different. He'd tell mom money's going missing, I found empty boxes in her room. All lies. But he was patient. He built the story slowly over months until mom had no choice but to believe him. I tried explaining, showed her my bank statements, my work schedule, everything. But Vincent was already three steps ahead. He planted evidence, twisted conversations, made me look unstable for even defending myself. The night mom told me to leave, Vincent stood behind her with this satisfied smirk I'll never forget. Fast forward 12 years. I'm a physical therapist now married to Devon. Able life in Seattle. Mom's been trying to reconcile for the past two years. Sunday phone calls, holiday texts, the whole routine. But Vincent's still in the picture, still playing victim about how I abandoned the family and broke Mom's heart. Tonight at Mom's 60th birthday dinner at this Italian place downtown, my Uncle Mitchell doesn't know Vincent sitting three seats down when he makes that comment. I'd specifically arranged the seating so they be separated by other family members. The table goes completely silent, 15 people, mid bite, frozen. Vincent's fork clatters against his plate. I've been preparing for this moment for months. I pull out my phone, open my photos. Mom, remember when Vincent said I stole $3,000 from you guys, that's why you kicked me out? She nodded slowly, her wine glass halfway to her lips. I swiped to a bank statement from 2,012. This shows Vincent withdrew that exact amount from your joint account the same week. So Tember 14th, 2,012. Then blamed me three days later. Mom's face drains of color. She sets down her glass. My Aunt Rachel leans in to look. Is that real? Bank of America confirmed it last month. I say I request.

On the third day, mom seemed stronger, color back in her cheeks. I need to tell you something, she said. Mom, rest. No, listen. She took a breath. I updated my will three months ago. My stomach dropped. You don't need to. Tyler gets the house. It's worth about $800,000 now. I nodded. Expect did you get my wedding ring and the photo albums? I swallowed hard. That's fine, mom. Really? There's a letter, too, in the safe deposit box. You'll understand when you read it. She fell asleep. After that, I didn't think much about it. Tyler had always been the one, the successful one, the one who deserved everything. Four days later, early morning, Mom's heart gave out. Peaceful, no pain. I was holding her hand. Tyler arrived an hour after she passed, cried loudly in the hallway, made a scene. At the reading of the will, Tyler sat across from me, confident, smug. The lawyer read through everything. House to Tyler, stocks split evenly, savings to dad, then and to Nathan. I leave my wedding ring and all family photo albums. Tyler actually laughed. Seriously, photos. The lawyer handed me an envelope. Your mother left this for you. I opened it later alone. Inside was a handwritten note on Mom's stationery. Asterisk, Nate. Asterisk, asterisk. Tyler will get what he values, money, property, things he can show off. Asterisk, asterisk. You get what mattered to me, the Memories we made when no one was watching. The quiet mornings, the recipes we tested together, the walks in the park. Asterisk, asterisk. He chose success. You chose presents. Asterisk, asterisk. I saw you every time, every moment. You thought no one noticed, asterisk, asterisk. Where my ring? Remember, I loved you exactly as you are. Asterisk, asterisk, mom, asterisk. I sat on my bedroom floor and cried for an hour. Tyler called that night. This is garbage. You manipulated her. I was just there, Tyler. You poisoned her against me. I hung up. At the funeral, Tyler sat in the back, didn't speak, left before the reception. Dad pulled me aside. She talked about you constantly those last months. Said you reminded her of her father. Kind, steady. I wore Mom's ring on a chain around my neck. And at the reception when someone asked.

The room laughed. A week later, when our mom landed in the hospital, I was the only one who showed up and the only one she asked for. Growing up, Tyler was the golden child, straight A's, med school, married his college sweetheart, three kids, big house in the suburbs, club membership. I was just the other one, the guy who chose teaching over money, who bought a modest townhouse. Instead of keeping up appearances at family dinners, mom would brag about Tyler's latest achievement, his new car, his promotion, his kid, it's private school. I'd sit there nodding, smiling. My 40th birthday fell on a Saturday. My wife Claire threw a small dinner, both our families. I'd spent all afternoon making tiramisu from scratch, Mom's old recipe, the one she used to make for special occasions. Tyler took one look and smirked. Look at that. Nate finally did something useful. The table erupted in laughter. Dad chuckled. Tyler's wife grinned. Even my own kids giggled. Claire's smile was tight. I set the dessert down, forced to laugh. Yeah, that's me, Mister Useful. I cut everyone a slice, ate mine in silence, left early, blamed a headache. Claire squeezed my hand in the car. He's an ass family, I said. A week later, my phone rang at 2:00am. Dad's voice was shaking. Your mom collapsed at Mercy, General. I threw on clothes, grabbed my keys. The hospital was 35 minutes away. I made it in 22. Dad was in the waiting room, pale, hands trembling. Called him, he's coming. I sat with dad until 4:00am. Finally, a doctor came out. She's stable. You can see her. Mom looked small in that bed, tubes everywhere, monitors beeping. Her eyes opened. When I walked in, Nate, she whispered. I took her hand. I'm here, mom. Don't leave. I won't. Tyler showed up at 8:00am, hair perfect, Starbucks cup in hand. Traffic, he said, not looking at me. Mom was awake by then, groggy but alert. She looked past Tyler. Squeeze my hand tighter. Where were you, she asked him. Tyler blinked. I'm here now. Mom had to arrange coverage at the practice. She pulled her hand from his kids to get ready for school. So does he, mom said quietly. He was just here. Tyler's jaw tightened. He stayed for 20 minutes, then left. I stayed for three days, sleeping in the chair beside her bed, bringing dad coffee, talking to doctors.

I'm sure we'd like to make this right. What would it take? I'd already started my new job. Better office, better salary, a boss who said thank you. Nothing. I told the VP, but you should know, Derek's been taking credit for deals. He didn't close my deals. If you check the emails, the contracts, you'll see my name, not his. There was a long pause. We'll look into that. Day 8, the calls escalated. The Harrington account had questions. Payments were delayed. They've been working with me, not Derek. They wanted me back on the account or they'd walk. Derek called six times that day. I ignored everyone. Day 9, my former colleague Sarah texted me, Derek just got fired. They brought in all his clients. Half of them said they only worked with the company because of you. The VP found the emails. You mentioned Derek had been falsifying reports for two years. I smiled, didn't respond. Week 2, at my new job, I closed a 1.8 million dollar deal. My new boss called me into his office. I'm impressed. That's exceptional work. Thank you, I said. It's nice to be appreciated. Week 3, Derek showed up at my new office building. Security called me. I went down to the lobby. He looked smaller, somehow deflated. I made a mistake. He, I underestimated you. Yes, you did. Can you help me? I'm struggling to find work. Your reputation followed you. I said, turns out when you take credit, For other people's wins. Those people remember I can put in a good word somewhere. I considered it for about two seconds. Eric, anyone could do your job. You're easily replaceable. His face fell. That's not fair. Fair, I smiled. You spent years making people feel worthless, stealing credit, breaking them down. And now that you're on the other side, you want fairness? I turned to walk away. Wait, he called out. What do I do now? Learn, I said over my shoulder. Learn that people aren't replaceable. Relationships matter. Respect matters. And when you treat people like they're nothing, don't be surprised when they prove you wrong. I never saw Derek again. Heard through the Grapevine, he took a job three levels below where he'd been heard. His new boss was exactly like he used to be. Karma's funny that way. Six months later, I got promoted. My team closed $12 million in deals that quarter. At the Celebration dinner, my boss raised a glass to irreplaceable people. I smiled and thought of Derek, of his smirk, of his cruelty. Anyone can do your job. He'd meant it as an insult, as a way to keep me small. Instead, it became the push I needed to realize my worth and to find people who saw it too replaceable, not even close.

You're easily replaceable. I nodded, finished my coffee, and walked out. One week later, he called, begging, but I just laughed. Anyone could do your job. You're easily replaceable. My boss, Derek, said it in front of the entire sales team, 12 people watching. He leaned back in his chair, smirking. We've got 50 resumes for every position. Don't ever think you're special. This wasn't new. Derek had a pattern. Public humiliation, power plays. He built his management style on making people feel small. Most people took it, followed their pride, stayed because they needed the paycheck. I used to be one of them. But three months earlier, something changed. I closed the Harrington account. $2.4 million, our biggest deal in five years. Derek took credit in the executive meeting, told the VP it was his strategy, his relationship building. My name never came up. When I confronted him privately, he laughed. That's how this works. I'm the manager. Your wins are my wins. Get used to it or leave. I didn't leave. Not then. Instead, I started documenting everything. Every client I brought in, every relationship I built, every deal I closed. I backed up emails, saved contracts with my signature, recorded call logs. Then I started making calls discreetly. To competitors, to former colleagues who'd escape Derek's department, to recruiters who specialized in enterprise sales. By the time Derek said I was replaceable, I had three job offers. Each one paid more. Better titles, better bosses. But I wasn't ready to leave yet. Not until Derek understood exactly what he was losing. So when he said those words, anyone could do your job. I just nodded, finished my coffee, stood up and said, you're right, Derek. Anyone can do my job. Good luck finding them. I walked out of the conference room, grabbed my personal items from my desk. Laptop, photos, the signed baseball from the Harrington deal that Derek didn't know about. In 15 minutes, I was gone. No two weeks notice, no dramatic speech. Just gone. The first call came two days later. Derek's assistant. There's been a misunderstanding. Derek wants to talk. I declined. The second call came on Day 4. Derek himself. Look, maybe I was too harsh. Let's grab coffee and work this out. I told him I'd already accepted another position. He sputtered. You can't just leave. We have active deals. Exactly. I said, you do? Hope you can close them.

So I showed the board her portfolio of Instagram filters and motivational quotes. The email came on a Tuesday morning. We need to talk about bringing Amanda on full time. Conference room at 2. I stared at the message from Kyle, my business partner. We'd started the marketing agency together four years ago, built it from nothing to $2.3 million in annual revenue, 12 employees, real clients, real growth. Amanda was Kyle's wife. She help with some social media posts when we first launched, mostly Instagram stories, inspirational quotes over sunset photos. I walked into the conference room at 2. Kyle was already there, so was Amanda. Thanks for meeting, Kyle said. We've been talking and Amanda wants to come on board full time. Doing what? Creative director. Amanda said she had a folder, actual printed materials. I've been developing a vision for where the agency should go. We need to elevate our brand presence. She opened the folder. Inside were printouts of Instagram posts, motivational quotes and cursive fonts. Choose joy, hustle harder, dream big. This is our current aesthetic, she said. It's fine for where we were, but if we want to compete with the big agencies, we need to be bold, disruptive. Look at Kyle. He was notting along. What kind of role are you thinking, I asked. Creative director. I'd oversee all client campaigns, manage the design team, set the visual direction. For the company, we already have a creative director, Maria. She's been with us three years. Maria is talented, Amanda said, but she doesn't have the strategic vision we need to scale. Maria had a degree from Parsons, 10 years of agency experience. She'd won two regional Addy Awards for campaign she'd LED for us. What's your background? I asked Amanda. I have an associate degree in communications and I've been managing my personal brand for six years. 23,000 Instagram followers. Managing your personal brand? Yes. Content strategy, visual identity, audience engagement. It's the same skill set just applied to corporate clients. Kyle cleared his throat. The salary would be $95,000, same as Maria. My stomach dropped. 95,000. It's market rate for a creative director. What companies? We looked at industry standards, Amanda said. Glass Door shows creative directors at agencies our size making between 85 k and 110 k. Those are people with portfolios, with client work, with degrees. Amanda's face hardened. I have a portfolio. She pulled out more pages, Instagram posts from her personal account. A mood board she made on Canva, a list of brand values that included authenticity and empowerment. This isn't a portfolio, I said. This is a Pinterest board. Excuse me. You've never worked at an agency. You've never managed a client. You've never LED a design team. You want nothing.

Our other neighbor looked genuinely confused. You mean the happy sounds? My kids love hearing it. They think he's having the best time out there. They asked me when he's coming out to play. That's not happiness. The woman was losing it. Now that's a disturbance that needs professional intervention. My other neighbor smiled. My brother's autistic. What you're describing is completely normal and healthy. The husband tried to salvage things. Look, we're all reasonable adults here. We're just looking for some kind of compromise. Quieter hours, maybe? My wife stepped forward. Should we drug our child into silence so you're comfortable? Is that what you want? We're not saying that at all. He backed up. Just better timing for outdoor activities when fewer people are around. He goes out when he needs to, and we're not scheduling his emotions around your convenience. The woman grabbed her papers and clutched them tight. Fine. The HOA will handle you people, since you clearly have zero respect for this neighborhood. She stormed off down the driveway. Her husband followed, looking embarrassed. Three days later, the HOA sent us a letter about noise complaints and threatening behavior. I called the president immediately. He let out this long, exhausted sigh when I explained the situation. She's been emailing me multiple times every day for weeks now. I keep telling her a kid playing in his own yard isn't a violation of anything. She wants us to create New rules, specifically about this. She threatening to sue the HOA if we don't take action. I told her that's not how any of this works. Last week, I saw her at the grocery store yelling at a teenage cashier about expired coupons. Her daughter was standing right there looking mortified. The girl spotted my son down the aisle, and her face lit up. She waved at him. He waved back with a shy smile. The neighbor's head whipped around. She snatched her daughter's hand and yanked her toward the exit. She stared us down with pure hatred as she dragged her kid out the door. A month later, a for sale sign appeared in their front yard. The realtor came by our house one afternoon. I wanted to give you advanced notice that we'll be doing showings this weekend. Would it be possible to keep things quiet during those times? Keep what quiet, exactly? Your son. The previous owners mentioned he can be quite loud, and I'd prefer potential buyers don't hear anything that might impact her decision. My son lives here. He'll be doing whatever he normally does. She tried to force a smile. I completely understand. But maybe just for a few hours on Saturday and Sunday. I said no and shut the door. They ended up selling below asking price after three months.

My neighbor banged on my door at 7:00am. Your son screams every weekend and I'm done being polite about it. What are you talking about? The noise from your backyard. It happens every Saturday and Sunday like clockwork. The whole street hears it and my daughter thinks someone is dying over here. My son has autism and when he gets overwhelmed, he needs to let it out somewhere safe. Our backyard is private. I don't care what he has. She cut me off hard. This affects everyone and my daughter is having nightmares about it. Then tell her some kids express themselves differently. I'm not explaining your problems to my child. She shot back. That's not my job as a parent. Her husband appeared behind her. We've tried to be understanding, but this can't continue like this. You've never said anything to us before. He held up his phone. I've been recording everything and sending it to the HOA for two months. Now we have documentation. You're recording my son for evidence. He said it flatly. This isn't normal behavior and you know it. My son came to the door holding his tablet. He looked scared from all the yelling. The neighbor stepped backward fast. See, even the way he moves is disturbing. Something's not right here. He started humming quietly. That's what he does when he's anxious. She pointed right at him. That sound Right there. Hours of that every single day through our fence. I can hear it in my kitchen. He's 10 years old. He's not hurting anyone. My voice was getting tight. Her face turned bright red. My daughter can't sleep at night because she thinks your house is haunted, she told her entire class at school. I had to go in and talk to the teacher, maybe explain that people are different instead of making him sound like a monster. She nearly yelled. I shouldn't have to teach my kid about your family's issues. That's on you. My wife pushed past me into the doorway. Our son exists and that's not negotiable. You need to leave our property. The neighbor pulled out more papers from her pocket. I spoke to a lawyer about noise ordinances and disturbance laws. We have grounds here. You're threatening to sue us because our kid plays in his own yard. If you can't control him, maybe you should consider moving somewhere more appropriate for your situation. She said it like she'd been planning that line. My son's humming got louder and he started rocking side to side. She pointed again with this triumphant look. This is exactly what I mean. This is what we deal with constantly. Our other neighbor jogged over from across the street. Everything okay? I heard shouting from inside my house. The woman spun toward her. Perfect timing. Maybe you can help us explain the constant.

The family started cheering. The cast member looked at us with this apologetic face. I'm so sorry. We're completely sold out. My sister made this sound I've never heard from a human before. My mom got in the cast member's face. No, absolutely not. Check the back. There has to be more. The cast member kept apologizing and my sister started crying. The family in front of us was walking away with their kid holding the bucket above his head. My sister took off running and my mom went right after her. My sister tried to grab the bucket from the kid's hands. The dad pulled his son away and my sister was screaming, you don't even care about figment. You're just gonna throw that away in a week. My mom shoved the dad so hard he stumbled backwards. Then she lunged at the kid and grabbed the bucket. Kid started wailing. The other mom tried to grab it back and my mom yanked it away so hard the handle broke. My sister dropped to her knees sobbing, no, you broke it. Then she looked up at me with your hatred. This is all your fault. If you had run when I told you to, we would have been ahead of them. Disney security showed up and escorted us past hundreds of people who were recording and staring. My sister was crying so hard she could barely Walk and my mom was arguing with security the entire time. We got taken to some office where a supervisor explained that we were banned from all Disney properties. Mom tried to argue that my sister has a medical condition. My daughter needs this popcorn bucket for her mental health. My dad was sitting in the corner with his head in his hands. My sister was on her phone looking up resale prices for the bucket and crying harder every time she refreshed. The supervisor said we needed to leave immediately and that if we tried to come back, we'd be arrested for trespassing. They walked us out through a back exit. We had dinner reservations that night that cost $400 and we missed it because we spent three hours getting banned from Disney World. We drove back to the hotel in complete silence except for my sister sobbing in the back seat. My mom kept saying that family is going to sell that bucket for hundreds of dollars. That's why they wanted it so badly. I checked my phone and my sister had posted a five paragraph rant about Disney discriminating against adults and how I ruined her life by not caring about her passion. My mom had already commented, so proud of you for standing up for yourself, baby girl.

My sister has been obsessed with Disney since we were kids, but it got really bad after college. She's 24 now and has an annual pass even though we live in Ohio, which means my parents fund her monthly trips to Florida. Her room looks like a Disney store exploded in it. She has hundreds of collector pins covering every surface and a shrine to figment the Dragon in the corner. She even tracks limited edition merchandise on a spreadsheet. My parents pay for everything because she claimed she was building a business selling Disney content, but her Instagram only had 200 followers. I wanted nothing to do with this weird Disney worship, but my mom somehow guilt tripped me into going on a family trip with them. The trip was a nightmare from day one. My sister had a full itinerary planned down to the minute, including which bathrooms we were allowed to use. She cried twice before lunch on the first day because the character meet and greet line was too long. My parents just kept apologizing to her and buying her stuff to calm her down. By day three, I was looking at flights home. That's when my sister burst into my room at 6:00am. The segment bucket drops tomorrow, she said like she was announcing someone died. She made us sit through a 45 minute Presentation about how we were going to obtain the bucket. My mom was taking notes and my dad asked if we needed walkie talkies. When I said it's just a popcorn bucket, my sister's face went red. You don't get me. You never have. My mom squeezed my arm. Please just support her. The next morning, we got to Eckhart two hours before it opened. When the gates opened, everyone started power walking toward the store. My sister was practically running and my parents were right behind her. I was walking at a normal pace because I don't run for anyone. When we got in line at the store, it was already wrapped around the building. My sister was on her phone refreshing five different Disney Facebook groups and doing breathing exercises. My mom was next to her saying, you're doing so good, baby. We're almost there. When we finally got close to the front, a cast member came out and started counting heads. She pointed at the family.

They acted like I was the villain for not giving up something I paid for. They tried to guilt trip me by sticking their kid in my seat before I even got there, hoping I'd just go along with it. That's manipulative. If sitting together was so important, book your seats in advance like everyone else. Don't show up expecting strangers to fix your problem and then act like they're terrible people when they say, no, I didn't ask why they needed To sit together. I didn't care. Maybe the kid gets scared flying. Maybe the dad's controlling. Maybe they just didn't feel like paying extra to pick seats. None of that is my problem. The dad tried to shame me in front of a plane full of people. And when that didn't work, he got passive aggressive and his wife just sat there watching him act like a child. The irony.

So I made sure they turned into laughing stocks. The day I met Brian's mother, Rita, she looked me up and down and said I seem nice for a temporary girlfriend. That should have been my warning. Brian and I met at a veterinary conference in Denver. He was presenting on equine surgery. I was there for my small animal practice. We bonded over terrible conference coffee and our shared obsession with emergency medicine. Six months later, he proposed at the same conference, right where we'd first met. His family's reaction was immediate and vicious. Rita called Brian crying, saying he was throwing his life away. His father Richard, sent a formal email listing all the women from their country club who would have been better choices. His sister Sophia started a group chat with the extended family called Brian's Mistake, where they shared articles about divorce rates. I didn't know Brian had seen it when he borrowed Sophia's phone. For two years, I tried everything. I brought Rita her favorite flowers on every visit. I helped Richard with his classic car restoration research. I attended Sophia's Boring Charity luncheons for her friends whispered about me being a gold digger even though I made more money than Brian. Nothing worked. They wanted their son to marry Victoria, the daughter of their best friends, who'd been waiting for Brian to notice her. Since high school. Victoria, who still called him twice a week. Victoria, whose parents owned half the commercial real estate in town. I stopped trying after Rita's Thanksgiving incident. She'd invited Victoria to dinner without telling us, seated her next to Brian, and spent the entire meal talking about their shared memories while I sat there like furniture. Brian finally told them that if they couldn't respect me, they wouldn't be part of our lives. They backed off, but only superficially. The wedding planning revealed their true strategy. Rita insisted on being involved, then criticized every choice. The venue was too rustic, the flowers were too simple, the caterer wasn't prestigious enough. She offered to pay for upgrades, but only if she could make the decisions. Declined, and paid for everything ourselves. Three days before the wedding, Sophia called Brian, panicking. She'd seen our cousin posting about her dress and realized she bought the same one I described as similar to mine. Could she still

She agreed, sounded apologetic even. The morning of our wedding, I was getting ready with my bridesmaids when the photographer knocked. He needed to discuss something urgent. Brian's family had arrived for pre ceremony photos and there was a situation. Every single one of them was wearing white. Rita was in a white beaded gown that looked like a mother of the bride dress because it was one. Richard is in a white suit. Sophia is in a white cocktail dress. Brian's grandmother, aunts, uncles and cousins all in white. 23 people dressed like they were attending their own weddings. The photographer didn't know what to do. My maid of honor, Julia started cursing. My mother went silent, which was worse than yelling. I asked the photographer to give us a moment and sat down. To think they wanted to ruin my wedding. They wanted the photos to look ridiculous. Everyone to talk about how his family upstaged me for the day to be about their protest instead of our marriage. But then I remembered something. Julia's sister managed a Halloween store that stayed open year round for theater productions. It was 40 minutes away. I called her. Did she have costume accessories in bulk? Specifically, did she have those cheap promotional t shirts from last Halloween's zombie run, the bright red ones with fake blood spatters that said survivor in huge letters? She had boxes of them. Julia and two bridesmaids. Drove there while I continued getting ready. They came back with 30 shirts and a bag of accessories. I had the wedding coordinator call a quick meeting with Brian's family in the garden, away from other guests. I walked out in my wedding dress carrying the box of shirts. Rita started to speak, probably to make some excuse, but I cut her off. You have two choices, I said. Put these on over your clothes right now or leave. The ceremony starts in 20 minutes. Sophia laughed, said I was being ridiculous, that I couldn't force them to ruin their outfits. Richard said I had no right to make demands. Rita called me a controlling bitch who'd finally shown my true colours. That's when Brian appeared. He'd been waiting inside, letting me handle it my way. First. He looked at his family, all dressed in white, and said five words, put them on or go. Their jaws dropped. Full story on channel link below.

Our daughter's mouth snapped shut, but her eyes were still blazing with anger. Sit down, my husband said quietly, and listen to me. She sat, arms crossed, glaring at him. You wanna talk about privilege, he said, pulling out his phone. Let me show you something I don't want to, she started. No, you're going to watch this and you're going to think about what real homophobia looks like. He pulled up a video. The first one showed gay people in the Middle East talking about living and hiding, about the constant fear. Then another from Eastern Europe where a pride parade got attacked. Then footage I couldn't even watch all the way through showing what happens to LGBTQ people in countries where it's illegal. Our daughter's face changed. The anger drained away, replaced by something else for maybe or shame. That's real homophobia, my husband said. That's what actual discrimination looks like. You live in a country where you can dye your hair rainbow and wear ride shirts and call your parents bigots over dinner. Do you understand how incredibly lucky you are? Dad, I am not finished. His voice was shaking now. We love you. We have loved you since the day you were born and we will Love you until the day we die. We have spent months learning how to support you better. We read books. We went to groups. We changed the way we talk and think because we want you to feel safe and loved. Tears were rolling down his cheeks now. But you don't get to weaponize your sexuality. You don't get to scream homophobia every time someone disagrees with you. There are gay kids your age who are being thrown out of their homes, beaten, killed, and you're calling us bigots be cause we won't dye our hair. Our daughter was crying now, too. I just wanted you to show that you care. We do care, I said. But showing we care doesn't mean doing everything you demand. That's not how love works. She, he stood up from the table without another word and went upstairs. We heard her door closed. That was 3 hours ago. The house has been completely silent since then. I can see light under her door, but she hasn't come out. My husband is sitting on the couch staring at nothing. I think we both feel like we failed somehow. Even though I know what he said needed to be said, I just don't know what happens next.

So I gave her a tough reality check. She came out at 15, and we were nothing but supportive. My husband cried happy tears, told her we loved her no matter what. I immediately ordered books on supporting LGBTQ teens. We researched everything, joined parent support group, Learned the terminology. We thought we were doing everything right. But over the past few months, something shifted. Every single conversation became about her sexuality. Every disagreement became ammunition. I asked her to clean her room. You're only saying that because as I'm gay. My husband said she couldn't go to a party. This is homophobia. At first, we thought maybe this was normal, part of her finding her identity. The support group said to be patient, but kept escalating. She started policing our language, our friends, even what we watched on TV. If we didn't immediately agree with every opinion she had, suddenly we were anti gay. The worst part? We couldn't even talk about it. Anytime we tried to have a conversation, she'd shut down or start crying about how we didn't support her. My husband and I felt like we were walking on eggshells in our own house. Last night, everything came to a head. We were having dinner, just normal Wednesday night pasta, when she brought up Pride Month. She dyed her hair rainbow the week before, and honestly, it looked great. We told her That we'd already promised to go to the raid with her in a few weeks, but apparently that wasn't enough. I think it's disgusting when straight people don't show visible support during pride, she said, twirling her pasta. It's basically the same as racism. If you're not actively showing you're an ally, you're part of the problem. My husband and I exchanged a look. Here we go again. Honey, we are allies, I said carefully. We support you completely. Then prove it, she said. I want all of us to dye our hair for Pride Month. Any rainbow color. It doesn't matter which one. I tried to stay calm. Sweetheart, we're not going to do that. We support, but we don't need to dye our hair to prove it. Her face went red. Are you serious right now? This is exactly what I'm talking about. You say you support me, but when it comes to actually doing something, you won't. Dying our hair isn't. I started. You're homophobic! She yelled. Both of you! You don't actually support me, you just pretend to.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from Accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. A crowd formed to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. Crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space, someone yelled. Laughter erupted. The CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was ex.

In our senior year, Marcus had always been the guy who made school bearable. The one who'd impersonate teachers perfectly or release three chickens numbered 1, 2 and 4 into the hallways, leaving staff searching for non existent chicken No. 3 for hours. His pranks were creative but never truly harmful until graduation day. For weeks, he'd been mysteriously absent. During lunch periods, we noticed him hanging around the auditorium where graduation would be held, but assumed he was just helping set up like other student during the ceremony. Everything seemed normal until our principal approached the podium to deliver his traditional speech. When you press the microphone button instead of turning on, the entire electrical system shut down. In the confusion that followed, the giant projection screen behind the stage suddenly lit up, apparently connected to some separate power source. What appeared was a compilation video of secretly recorded faculty meetings where teachers made sarcastic comments about students, gust grade, manipulations for athletes and our principal referred to our class as the worst batch in years. The footage was devastating. Miss Wilson mocking a student's learning disability. Coach Brenner admitting to changing grade. It's Doctor Harrison calling parents entitled whiners. Parents gasped. Students looked stunned. The teachers on stage froze in horror. Within seconds, parents began shouting. Several students in the audience burst into tears seeing their teachers true opinions of them. The superintendent tried desperately to shut down the Projection. But Marcus.

I was 22, living my best life when my phone exploded with calls from my entire family. My cousin Eve, who was 16, told everyone I'd been sneaking into her room and that she was now pregnant with my baby. The whole family believed her instantly. My parents screamed at me over the phone, calling me disgusting. My siblings blocked me on everything. Even my grandparents who raised me wouldn't take my calls. I had zero proof it wasn't true. Eve was the family princess and I was just a black sheep cousin who barely came around anymore. The accusations spread like wildfire through our tight knit extended family. Aunts and uncles who used to invite me to barbecues suddenly acted like I didn't exist. Mom's sister, Eve's mother posted critical Facebook statuses about protecting our children from predators in our own family. Within a week, I was completely erased from every family group chat, every holiday plan, every graduation announcement. The next year destroyed me completely. I waited every day for police to show up at my door with handcuffs. Every knock made my heart stop. Every phone call from an unknown number sent me into a panic attack. I lost my job at the auto shop because I couldn't focus, kept making mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss finally sat me down and said, whatever was going on? At home, needed to stay there, but I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment three months later when I couldn't make rent, moved in with a buddy who let me crash on his couch. But even he started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Started drinking heavily just to sleep. Then drinking to get through the day. Then drinking because breathing felt impossible without it. Dating became a nightmare. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried to date asked to meet my parents. After 2 months, I made up some story about them being dead. Second girl saw through the lies when she noticed I I had zero family photos, no childhood stories, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. And when I couldn't give a straight answer, he was gone by morning. The isolation was crushing. Holidays were the worst. Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call. I'd drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway knowing they were all inside without me. I finally moved three states away and started completely over. New job, new friends, new identity. Told everyone I met that my family lived far away and we weren't close. Simple, clean lie that people accepted. Got into therapy, got sober, worked my ass off to build something resembling a normal life.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together, I've been playing husband since year 2, paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down, tears in her eyes, hand on her heart, then some perfectly rehearsed excuse, we're not ready. Let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5, and she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time, convinced myself maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it when she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew, and she didn't even let me finish the speech, just shook her head with this pitying smile like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke, asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant and the mask came. Completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said. Voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place. After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place. Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. She didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working, she texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic started. Creep. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night acting extra sweet. Made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said. Kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

And they finally Learned what she left them with. I married my husband when his twins were eight. Their mom had walked out two years earlier, leaving nothing but a note that said she needed to find herself. No calls, no birthday cards, nothing but to hear the kids talk. She was a saint who'd been driven away. Every family dinner was a war zone. I'd cook their favorites and they'd push the plates away. Your meatloaf tastes weird. Real mom made it better. I'd help with homework and get accused of doing it wrong. Real mom was smarter. I bought them new clothes and heard how real mom had better taste. My husband would just sigh and say they needed time to adjust. Time, like three years wasn't enough. The breaking point came on their 11th birthday. I'd spent weeks planning, decorating the house, baking a cake from scratch, inviting all their friends. When they walked in and saw the decorations, my stepdaughter started crying, you ruined it. Real mom always took us to that fancy restaurant. You're trying too hard to be her and you'll never be. I looked at my husband. He wouldn't meet my eyes. The party went on, forced smiles and whispered complaints. That night, after everyone left, I made a decision. If I'd never be their real mom, I'd stop pretending to be any kind of mom at all. The Next morning, I moved my things to the guest room. I stopped cooking family dinners and made meals for just myself. They could fend for themselves or their dad could handle it. I stopped doing their laundry, stopped helping with homework, stopped driving them to activities. I stopped buying them things. I became a polite roommate in my own house. My husband was furious. You're acting like a child. They're kids. They don't know better. But I was done. Your kids made it clear I'm not their mother, so I'm not going to act like one. You wanted a wife. You got one. You wanted a mom for your kids. You should have married someone they'd actually accept. The first week, they barely noticed. By week 2, the complaint started. There's no food in the house. Why isn't my uniform clean? I need a ride to soccer practice. I'd smile politely. Ask your dad or maybe call your real mom since she's so wonderful. Week 3, my stepdaughter's big school project was due. She'd always left things to the last minute because I'd swoop in and help. Not anymore. She failed and came home crying. My husband tried to blame me. You could have reminded her, I shrugged. Real mom would have remembered. Then came the phone call that changed everything. It was a Thursday evening, one month into my strike. The doorbell rang and my husband answered. I heard raised voices, shocked gasps. A woman's voice I didn't recognize. But the kids did. They came running down the stairs screaming, Mom, mom, you came back. I walked into the living room and saw her, their real mom, standing in the doorway with a designer purse.

I told my dad and tried to move on. At Thanksgiving, my stepmom decided it was everyone's business. My. My cousin announced her pregnancy. My stepmom raised her wine glass and said, loud enough for all 17 relatives to hear, well, at least some of us can carry on the family name properly. She looked directly at me. It's such a shame when someone can't contribute to the family legacy. Makes you wonder if they're really part of the family at all. My dad just stared at his plate. He'd married her three years ago after my mom died. That became her weapon. At every gathering, she'd mention it. Oh, we're talking about grandchildren. Well, some of us won't be providing any. My dad gave apologetic looks, but never said a word. Christmas, she announced she was pregnant at 39. She spent the evening rubbing her belly and talking about real blood family and continuing the pure family line. That's when I started digging. I found her ex husband on Facebook. We talked for three hours. She'd cleaned out their joint accounts while he visited his dying mother, filed a restraining order based on fabricated abuse claims, took the house. He'd lost everything, including custody of his daughter, because she Convinced the judge he was dangerous. He had evidence. Bank statements, text messages, affidavits from neighbors who'd witnessed her screaming at him. I kept digging. Three previous marriages, same pattern. Then I found her daughter, the one she'd given up at 19 and never mentioned. I found her through adoption registries. She was 20 now and had been searching for years. I verified everything three times. Then I planned. Family reunion was in July at my uncle's lakehouse. My stepmom spent weeks planning it, determined to show off her pregnancy. I R S V P ed for two. She was holding court by the pool, one hand on her belly, surrounded by relatives. My dad stood beside her. I walked up with my guest. The crowd parted. My stepmom's face went white. This is my sister, I announced loudly. Her daughter from her first pregnancy, the one she's never mentioned. Her daughter turned to our stepmom. I've been looking for you for three years. I just wanted to know why you gave me up. My stepmom stammered. That's not. I don't. You must be mistaken. I pulled out my folder and started passing around documents. Bank statements from her second marriage showing theft. Police reports from her third marriage proving her abuse allegations were dismissed. Text messages where she told her friend she was only in it for the money. And medical records showing she'd had her tubes tied four years ago. The pregnancy was a lie. The bump was Padding.

The morning of the wedding, when the catering manager tried directing me to the kitchen, I marched straight to Gemma in her bridal suite. What the hell is this about me eating in the kitchen? I demanded. She barely looked up from her phone, saying, well, you are working, aren't you? It would look weird if the photographer was eating with guests. I reminded her of our agreement and she rolled her eyes. God, don't be so dramatic. Just do this one thing for me on my day. I stormed out of the bridal suite, but Gemma's mother immediately intercepted me in the hallway, pressing a vendor meal ticket into my hand. The kitchen staff will call you when it's time to eat. I handed it back firmly. I'm Gemma's Best friend and a guest. There's been a misunderstanding. Her mother's face went hold. Gemma specifically told me, you're the hired help. Don't make a scene at my daughter's wedding. During the ceremony, as I photographed from the aisle, Gemma's cousin leaned over and asked loudly, are you the budget photographer Gemma found on Craigslist? Before Gemma could respond from the altar, I announced, actually, I'm the professional photographer doing this as a wedding gift that would normally cost four grand. Gemma's face flushed red and her smile froze. Between the ceremony and reception, while photographing the wedding party, I overheard Gemma telling her bridesmaids she charged her parents $3,000 for photography, pocketing the money since she got me to work for free. So what? She snapped when I confronted her. You can afford it with all your fancy clients. Her maid of honour laughed about Gemma selling today's prince workers for $75 each as exclusive professional photography. I'm watermarking everything with my business logo and rates, I declared. Gemma grabbed my arm hard enough to leave marks. You will not ruin this for me. At cocktail hour, Marvin the groom, cornered me. He was drunk and tried sliding his hand down my back. Gemma told me about your desperate financial situation, he said, trying to imply something disgusting. I snapped loudly, get your hands off me, Marvin, or I'll tell everyone about Vegas! Gemma saw

I responded, understood. Two days later, their lawyer reached out to me in a panic. I've been the family's financial backbone for nearly 4 years. I paid their 1,800 dollar monthly mortgage like clockwork, plus utilities, insurance, emergency repairs, everything. My name, my credit, my money. They never said thank you. My sister Marissa was always in crisis. Credit card maxed out. I paid it. Car repairs, I covered it. Daycare costs, I sent cash until she figured it out. Three years later, she was still figuring it out. I never said no because I thought this was what family did until I Learned it was exactly what they expected. The first crack appeared while scrolling Facebook. There was Marissa, my parents and the kids in front of the house I was paying for, holding a Home Sweet Home sign. The caption, so proud of our daughter for building a future we can all share. This home is in the right hands. No acknowledgement of me, no tag, no gratitude, just them smiling on a porch I had paid for. Days later, I called the bank. Mortgage was still in my name, but there was a request to change the primary contact to Miss Marissa Harper. Then I found $2,400 missing from my account, transferred to Marissa's emergency card. When confronted, she said, don't make this a thing, Jordan. We needed groceries. I assumed we were still sharing that card. My Mother's response, Marissa is going through a lot. Let's not fight over a few dollars. Few dollars for me. Disaster for Marissa when she missed a phone payment. The family group chat became worse. Someone posted a meme of a man handing over his wallet. Big Brother Energy, pay now, ask never. My cousin tag Jordan. Another, can you cover my student loans too, my father? Only if you name your child after him to keep the donor happy. Nobody defended me. But the final blow came while mowing their backyard. The kitchen window was open and I heard my mother and Marissa talking. Marissa laughed. Did you see his face when I told Aunt Karen the house was mine? He didn't even blink like a puppy, just happy to sniff the plate. Mom giggled. Once the paperwork goes through, he won't be able to say anything. Then Marissa delivered the killing blow. Mom, he's not family anymore. He's just a sponsor. I stood there letting those words sink in. Not family as a sponsor. Three weeks later came the invitation for my mother's 60th birthday, 60 guests, full catering, a legacy event. I didn't rsvp, I just prepared. I printed everything, $311,115 and 84 total contributions with dates and bank records. I saved the audio of their conversation and screenshots of the group chat mockery. I arrived 15 minutes late. During the speeches about sacrifice and love, this screen showed the house with built with love, passed down with Purpose, no mention of me. My mother took the microphone. I'm proud of Marissa. She's shown what legacy truly means. This home will stay in the right hands. I stood up and walked to the microphone. Since we're talking about legacy, let's do the.

We went to court, and I won. The judge looked at their claims, looked at my evidence, and dismissed the case in under 20 minutes. He even made a comment about wasting the court's time. I thought that nightmare was finally over. Then last week, John's sister found me on Instagram under a fake account. She sent me a long message saying she just got engaged, but her boyfriend can't afford a ring. She said since I'm not engaged anymore, I should give her John's ring so it can actually be used for a wedding instead of sitting in my jewelry box. When I said no, she lost it. She started messaging me from different numbers, different social media accounts, even had her friends contact me, saying I was selfish and heartless. My phone was on the table during lunch with my friend Sarah when another message popped up. Sarah read it and asked what was going on. I explained everything, and she got quiet. Then she said maybe I should just give the ring to his sister, that it would mean more to someone who's actually getting married. She told our other friends, and now they're all saying the same thing. That I'm being petty, that I should move on and let the family have the ring. I started doubting myself. Maybe they were Right. Maybe I was holding onto something I didn't need anymore. But then yesterday, I found out the truth. One of John's co workers reached out to me. He said he'd heard about the court case and wanted me to know something. John had life insurance through his job policy. Worth $40,000. It went directly to his parents. The funeral cost 18,000. I did some digging. John's parents own a property management company. They have rental houses all over town. His dad drives a BMW. They're not rich, but they're definitely not broke. They were never struggling to pay for the funeral. They lied to me while I was grieving. Took my money, and then tried to take the one thing I had left of John. And now I know why. They really wanted the ring back. They were planning to sell it.

John died three months after proposing. We were supposed to get married in August. Instead, I planned his funeral in March. His parents called me two days after the accident, crying, saying they couldn't afford a proper service. I didn't even think twice. I emptied our wedding account, the one we've been building together for two years. Every penny we'd save for the venue, the catering, the photographer, all of it went to giving John the funeral he deserved. The morning after we buried him, I was still in the black dress from the service when his brother knocked on my door. He didn't ask how I was doing. He just said he needed the ring back. I was confused. I asked him why, and he looked me straight in the eye and said the ring had been in their family for five generations. Pass down from their great, great, great grandparents. He said it belonged to the family, not to me. I told him that was impossible. I was there when John bought it. We went to this jewelry store that makes some pieces inspired by fantasy movies. John picked out the design, paid for it with his credit card, and proposed that same night. The ring was two sizes too big, so we went back the next week and exchanged it for the right size. I still had the receipt. With both transactions, John's signature, everything. His brother's face turned red. He called me a liar and said I must have faked the paperwork. Then he stormed out. Within an hour, my phone wouldn't stop buzzing. John's mom, his dad, add his sister, his aunts. All of them calling and texting, saying I stole a family heirloom. They said I was dishonoring John's memory by keeping something that wasn't mine. I blocked most of them, but. And I got a letter from a lawyer. They were suing me for the ring, and they were demanding I reimburse them for the funeral costs. Because apparently, I had no right to plan it without their permission. I couldn't believe it. I paid for everything. The casket, the flowers, the burial plot, all of it. And now they wanted me to pay them back. I hired a lawyer and showed him everything. The receipt from the jewelry store with the date and John's name. The exchange paperwork showing we swapped sizes, photos I'd taken.

So I ghosted him, filed for divorce, and moved to a different city to protect my babies. I'm 28, married to Mike for six years. He was kind when we met, helped me escape my drug addicted parents. The only problem was his family. Mike came from extreme wealth. His mother and sister Kayla were cruel from day one. At our first dinner, his mother scoffed, if someone like you would know anything about art. His sister showed Mike bikini photos of his ex right in front of me, telling him he could slide into her DMs anytime. For years, they called me a gold digger, mocked my appearance, and made fun of my poor background. When Mike stopped talking to Kayla after she ruined my birthday, she sent me death threats via text. I eventually stopped attending family events all together. Despite his family, Mike proposed last year. His sister demanded he get a prenup because poor people like you suck money out of anyone. I offered to sign one anyway. I wasn't marrying him for money. Three months ago, I found out I was pregnant with twins. Mike insisted on announcing it at a family gathering. When we did, everyone congratulated us except Kayla and my mother in law, who stared daggers at me. Kayla had been trying to get pregnant for years. But was infertile. Mike's family tried convincing her to adopt, but she refused, saying she didn't want to raise a kid from the streets. When Mike's relatives asked about baby showers, Kayla burst out crying and locked herself in the bathroom. After 30 minutes, she came out and told me I should have talked to her first. My mother in law said I was selfish and made everything about me. Suddenly, Kayla became unusually kind. Both she and my mother in law started calling regularly, sending flowers with cards saying can't wait to see the twins. Kayla even offered to throw my baby shower, which she organized perfectly. The day of the shower, I excused myself to use the bathroom. Coming out, I heard my husband and mother in law arguing in hushed tones in the hallway. My mother in law asked Mike if he'd talked to me yet about their plan with the twins. Mike told her to lower her voice, but she said he needed to man up. Then she said it clearly. He needed to discuss this before the twins were born. Otherwise they wouldn't be able to give one of the twins to Kayla on time for her 27th birthday. She reminded him he'd already agreed, and she's been looking forward to getting a child for months now. They were planning to give away one of my babies as a birthday gift. I stood frozen as they discussed it like it was normal. Mike kept saying He was working on it, and it wasn't an easy conversation. I waited for them to finish.

I did. Days later, her father stormed into her house screaming, do you know what he just did? She didn't even look up from her phone when she said it. Just a casual go ahead, move out, like she was giving me permission to grab coffee. I could see her new guy's name lighting up her screen every few seconds. Sean. Of course, his name was Sean. You've been miserable here anyway, she added, still scrolling. We both know this hasn't been working. I didn't argue, didn't beg, just walked to the bedroom and started packing. Same duffle bag I'd used when I moved in seven years ago, back when her family actually pretended to respect me. She got louder as I folded shirts, talking to herself but making sure I could hear. You'll land on your feet or maybe not. That little laugh at the end, the one that cuts deep better than any insult. When I zip a bag and walked back through the kit Cooper, she looked up with mock surprise. You're actually going, you told me to. My voice was flat. I let the door closed behind me without looking back. What she forgot, what her whole entitled family forgot was that their boutique hotel, the 20 room property her father loves bragging about runs entirely on a booking system I built from scratch six years ago. Not just any system, custom platform I spent eight months developing Handling everything from reservations to inventory to automated guest communications. It's sophisticated, proprietary and licensed under my software company's name. When we were happy, I gave them a sweetheart deal, $500 a month for software that would cost them 15 grand anywhere else. Over six years, I'd save them over $1 million. They'd grown comfortable. Father strutted around town talking about our family business like he'd built it all himself, forgetting the tech guy who made it actually function. I gave it three days. Then I sent the email. Professional, courteous, completely airtight, 30 days notice to turn, terminate the licensing agreement. They could migrate to a new system or pay market rate, $12,000 per month plus a $50,000 setup fee. Their family lawyer called within an hour, voice tight with panic. You can't just pull the software. We have contracts. Check section 7, sub section 3, I said calmly. Either party may.

For my entire childhood, my family had this group chat. Mom, dad, my older brother Tyler, and my younger sister Mia. Everyone except me. I found out when I was 16. I walked into the kitchen, and they were all laughing about something. When I asked what was funny, they got quiet. Tyler slipped and said it was just something in the chat. What chat? My mom tried to play it off, oh, just a silly family thing. You know how it is. But I didn't know because I wasn't in it. I thought maybe it was a mistake, so I asked my dad to add me later. He said, sure, honey, but he never did. Then I started noticing things. They'd all go to dinner on random Tuesdays, take weekend trips I only heard about after my sister got concert tickets from the family chat. My brother knew about my cousin's wedding three months before I did. Every single time I asked to be included, they'd say, oh, yeah, we'll add you, and then just wouldn't. I tried bringing it up seriously. Once sat my mom down and said, it really hurts that I'm not in the family chat. She laughed. Actually laughed. Sweetheart, you're so sensitive. It's just a group chat. Just a group chat where they planned literally everything without me. My dad said I was making a big Deal out of nothing. Tyler told me to stop being weird about it. Mia said you wouldn't even use it anyway. But how would they know? They never gave me the chance. Last year, my brother got engaged. I found out three weeks later when I saw the photos on Facebook. Three weeks? It all known the night it happened because he announced it in the chat. When I confronted him, he said, I figured someone told you. Nobody did, because nobody thought about me. Then came my mom's birthday last month. I showed up at her house with flowers and a gift I'd spent two hours picking out. When I walked in, they were all dressed up, grabbing their coats. Oh, my mom said, looking genuinely surprised to see me. We're just heading out to dinner. What dinner? She glanced at my dad. The reservation for my birthday. Nobody told me about a reservation. Tyler jumped in. We thought you were busy. I wasn't busy. I was never busy. They just didn't tell me. My sister said it was in the chat. Like that explained everything. I stood there holding flowers in a gift bag, watching my entire family awkwardly shuffle toward the door. My mom gave me this pitying smile. We can do something next week, just the two of us. I left the flowers on the counter and walked out. That's when I decided I was done asking. Christmas came around and I didn't reach out. Didn't Ask about plans. Didn't text to confirm anything. Just waited. Two days before Christmas. My sister texted you coming to mom and Dad's on the 25th? I said I wasn't invited. She sent me a screenshot from the group chat. The one I'm still not in. Where they've been planning for weeks. Menu, who is bringing what, what time to arrive. Everything. I stared at that screenshot for a long time. Then I replied, let me know when there's a chat I'm actually part of. She tried calling. I decline.

She laughed and said, you're going away. For a long time, she didn't realize the house was still legally mine. And the officer she called was my brother. He just looked at her and said, ma'am, you might want to call your lawyer. I'm standing on what used to be our porch when Vanessa opens the door with this twisted smile plastered across her face. The kind of smile that says she's been planning this moment. She announces, already pulling out her phone to dial 9 1 1. I warned you to stay away from my property. Your property? I ask, keeping my voice calm. Vanessa, I just came to get my tools from the garage. We agreed. We agreed to nothing. She cuts me off, her finger hovering over the call button. You're trespassing, and now you're going to jail. I'd moved out three weeks ago after our breakup got nasty. I've been staying at my parents place, trying to figure out the next steps. The house, the one I bought two years before we even met, was supposed to be sorted out through lawyers. Vanessa had been stalling, refusing to move out, claiming she had tenant rights. Today, I'd simply come to collect my power tools from the garage. I texted her that morning to let her know. She'd responded with, fine, whatever. But apparently she'd had other plans. She presses the button. I can hear The dispatcher's voice through the speaker 911, what's your emergency? Yes, my ex boyfriend just broke into my house, Vanessa says, her voice suddenly shaking, theatrical. I'm terrified. Please send someone quickly. He's very aggressive. I just stand there, hands in my pockets, waiting. Because here's what Vanessa doesn't know. I'm not worried. Not even a little bit. The cop car pulls up within six minutes. Fast response time. The door opens and an officer steps out, adjusting his belt. When he turns toward us, I see the exact moment Vanessa's smirk reaches its safe peek. She thinks she's won. What she doesn't know is that Officer Bradley isn't just any cop. He's my younger brother. Bradley walks up the driveway, his face completely neutral, professional. He glances at me with zero recognition. We talked about this exact scenario last week when Vanessa had threatened to make my life hell. Then turns his attention to her. Ma'am, what seems to be the problem here? Vanessa straightens up, playing the victim perfectly. Officer, thank god you're here. This man, she points at me dramatically, broke into my house. I want him arrested. Bradley pulls out his notepad, clicking his pen. Your house, you said? Yes, my house, she repeats, more confident now. And you own this property? I live here. Vanessa snaps, irritation creeping into her voice. We lived here together. Now it's mine. Ma'am, that's not what I asked. Bradley says, his tone still perfectly calm, do you own this Property?

You were supposed to do all the work for the group. It was agreed. Julie screamed at me in front of our history class, a blank slideshow with only our names was shown on the giant screen. Did you want us to fail? Julie hissed. You told me you had it. I say you did this on purpose. Julie stuttered. She kept flipping through blank note cards of our group project. The realization setting in that I didn't complete the group project like she wanted. Mr Cooper, Julie whined. He didn't do anything. She pointed a finger at me. You are a total loser. Mr Cooper had us sit back down. The entire class was laughing at Julie's red face. On Monday, my history teacher, Mr Cooper, had announced that on Friday we'd be presenting a history project. It was a slideshow and speech on World War 2. Mister Cooper gave us the guidelines and requirements and put us into groups of five. After class that afternoon, my group headed into the school library. Julie was the leader of the popular kids and thought she was the queen bee. Now I'm going to do the speaking because like I'm totally the best, Julie insisted before I even sat down. But like, totally. You're gonna actually do all the work, Julie demanded. I rolled my eyes, but I got to work anyway. I wasn't gonna let them ruin my grades. Christie I'm trusting you with the fashion. We can't look like total rejects. I don't think it matters what we look like. It's about our work, I said, and received an eye roll in return. I just wanted to get the project done. We have to work, Cameron asked, laughing, totally confused, throwing his football around. So did anyone see how awesome I was at the game last night? Cameron continued. Oh, Cameron, you were so sexy. Christie flirted. We should like totally go to my house. They started to talk and chat like it was lunch, period. Anytime I tried to speak, they got louder. So I tried to work on my part of the project. On Wednesday, I arrived at Christie's house and I could hear the music blasting. It looked like half the school had shown up. Cameron had the entire football team there. Kids were doing the devil's grass. Christie had hired a DJ. Julie was even drinking out of the red solo cups. Guys, I totally found the good stuff, Christie said, drunk out of her mind and holding two bottles of vodka. We we need to do our project. I had to shout over the music. We don't need your help, nerd. If you're so worried about it, finish it yourself. Leave, Julie snorted, pointing to the door. So I did. When I got home, I sent the project off to Julie's email, but there was nothing done. I even deleted my own work. If They didn't want my help. Fine, let I'm cook. Thursday at school, Julie grinned at me. Thanks for finishing the project. I guess you were useful after all. I just smiled and nodded. You're welcome. Anything for the group. I knew I had to talk to Mr Cooper. Cut to this morning. I had gotten to school early and went to his class. Mr Cooper, I need to explain something. I'm a little panicked. What if he didn't believe me? Luckily, he did. I showed him the entire slideshow.

He was running out the clock while improving what he thought would become his property. Then on day 27, a massive hotel style soaking tub showed up for the master bathroom with jets and built in mood lighting. The installation took six hours and two plumbers to connect everything, and the tub alone was $8,000. When they finished, Liam texted me a photo of himself in the tub holding a glass of wine with the caption living my best life. I forwarded it to my lawyer and told her we were moving. Day 29, I showed up with my grandmother. Liam answered the door in a bathrobe like he owned the place, and barely acknowledged us before heading back to make coffee on his new espresso machine. I walked my grandmother through every room, pointing out the upgrades with exaggerated excitement. She played along perfectly. Liam, this hot tub is incredible. And this new bedroom. You did all of this? He looked confused, but nodded slowly. I let her into the master bathroom and gestured at the massive tub. And this is the crown jewel. Liam spent weeks picking out every detail to thank me for letting him stay here during his hard time. My grandmother hugged him. That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard. Not many young people understand gratitude anymore. Liam opened his mouth, but I kept talking. I've been wanting to redo This kitchen for years, but never had time. Having you surprise me with all this as a gift is just incredible. His face went pale. Now that the project's done, you can head home and get back to your life. It's been almost 30 days. I handed him an envelope. This is your notice to vacate. You've got four hours. He ripped it open and his face turned red. You can't do this. I put over $75,000 into this place. I smiled. Into my place as a gift. Like I just told grandma, gifts don't come with conditions. He looked at my grandmother for support. I never said it was a gift. This is my house now. I've been living here. My grandmother's face fell. Liam, you just let him think you did all this out of kindness? That's very disappointing. Liam turned back to me, desperate. You knew what I was doing. You watched me do it. I shrugged. I watched you give me the most generous gift anyone's ever given me. Thank you so much for my new kitchen and bathroom. Liam tried to protest, but my grandmother was already walking toward the deck to try out the hot tub. He looked at me one last time, saw nothing but a smile, and left without packing. I called out thank you to my grandmother and turned to take a long bubble bath in my brand new soaking tub.

My cousin Liam called me three months ago asking to use my Delaware beach house for a weekend. He just gone through another breakup and needed somewhere quiet to think. I said sure because the place it's empty most weekends anyway, and he promised he'd be gone by Monday. When I handed him the keys, he grabbed me in a hug and said, you have no idea how much this means to me right now. I told him to enjoy the ocean and left it at that. Monday came and went without a word. I texted Tuesday morning asking if he was okay and he said the extended stay was doing wonders for his mental health and he'd be out by Friday. Friday became next Monday, then the following week, then excuses about car trouble and waiting for parts. Two weeks after I handed Liam the keys, my neighbour sent a photo of construction trucks in my driveway. I drove down immediately and walked into my house to find workers ripping out my kitchen cabinets while Liam stood there pointing at granite samples like he was choosing tile for his own renovation show. I stared at the gutted kitchen and asked what he thought he was doing. He didn't even look up from the countertop brochure in his hand. This kitchen is ancient and the layout makes no Sense I'm doing you a favor by fixing it while I'm here. You should be thanking me. I asked how he planned to pay for this and he waved me off. I've got it covered. You worry too much. Besides, it's not like you were using this place anyway. The contractor showed me the work order with Liam's name on it, requesting a full remodel with custom cabinets, stone countertops and new appliances. $28,000. I looked at Liam scrolling through his phone like this was all perfectly normal and something clicked. I told. I told the contractor everything looked great and to keep going. Then I walked out without another word. Over the next two weeks I watched my beach house transform into something I didn't recognise. A 15 thousand dollar hot tub appeared on the deck with crews running electrical lines and reinforcing the structure for three straight days. My neighbour kept me updated on the noise and the constant parade of trucks and I told her it would be over soon. All my furniture disappeared and got replaced with a 12 thousand dollar leather sectional, matching chairs and a glass dining table that probably cost more than both. A construction crew framed out a whole new bedroom addition off the back of the house with Florida ceiling windows facing the water and the permits and construction ran him another 14,000. I checked the county permits and found Liam had filed everything under his name as the property owner. Forging paperwork that said he had authority to make structural changes. I also checked tenant laws and realized what he was doing. After 30 days of continuous residence, he legal

I was in the bathroom during lunch when I heard two girls talking outside. Did you see Lena's test? Another hundred. Obviously she goes to Caldwell's tutoring. I sat there frozen because I just got my test back that morning. 54. I'd studied for hours and knew every answer. I rushed back to class and grabbed my test from my bag. Then I looked at Lena's desk. Her test was sitting there with 100 circled in green pen. We'd studied together the night before. I'd helped her understand half the material. During class, I glanced at her answers. They looked almost identical to mine. But mine was covered in red marks. After class, I caught up to her. My heart was pounding. Lena, how did you get 100? Our answers were the same. She wouldn't look at me. I go to Mister Caldwell's tutoring. You should try it. Then she walked away fast. That night, I laid my last three tests out. 58, 61, 54. Each one worse. Even though I studied harder. I needed to figure out what was happening. The next week, I went to Caldwell's classroom after school. I felt nauseous the entire walk there. Mister Caldwell, I need help understanding why I keep failing. He barely looked up. You're not putting in the effort. My chest got tight. But I study constantly. I know this material. He stared at me like I was the dumbest person he'd Ever seen? Then maybe history isn't your strong suit. You should consider switching to regular history. I felt my face getting hot. My answers are the same as students who are passing. His voice went ice cold. Are you accusing me of something? My mouth went dry. No, I just don't understand the grading. He waved his hand at me. Then figure it out yourself. I have work to do. I left feeling worthless. Next test came back worse. 49. I cried in the bathroom during lunch. Before turning that test in, I'd taken a photo of my answers. When I compared it to my graded test, I felt sick. Half my correct answers were marked wrong. Meanwhile, Lena showed me her test. Another hundred. One of her essay answers was three sentences that barely made sense. I showed her my photo, which was a full paragraph with dates and analysis. She glanced at it, then looked down. I don't want to talk about this. Her voice was quiet and scared. Over the next month, I noticed the pattern. Girls were getting top scores while guys were failing. I started sitting with three other guys from class. At lunch, we laid out our tests. All of us were failing despite knowing the material. All of us had jobs or sports after school. One of them said he'd asked Caldwell for help and got told to stop wasting his time. We started keeping track. 8 girls getting straight hundreds. 12 of Us failing everything. Then one of the guys said something that made my skin crawl. All those girls go to Caldwell after school, tutoring. Every single one of them. I went to my guidance counselor with this Pat. She looked at me like I was being dramatic. Mr. Caldwell has been here 15 years. If you're failing, maybe you need to take responsibility. Nobody would listen. Caldwell acted like I didn't exist. My grade dropped to a 46. I was going to fail this class, and nobody cared. In January, I can't take it anymore. I walk to the principal's office with the photos, the pattern and the proof. The three other guys are right behind me. We're done being quiet. The principal listens without interrupt

I raised my hand as a joke. I helped my mom watch YouTube videos when she was pregnant with my brother. Does that count? The class laughed and I smiled, proud of my quick thinking. But Mister Gonzales wasn't smiling. His face had gone completely white and his hands were shaking as he gripped the edge of his desk. Good. Come with me now. The entire classroom went silent in South Dallas when a teacher used that tone. You didn't ask questions. Everyone stay in your seats. Do not leave this room. If I'm not back in 20 minutes, have someone call 9, 1 1. He was already pulling me toward the door and that's when I noticed the dark stain on his sleeve. Wet. It looked like blood. Mr Gonzales, what's happening? Is someone hurt? I tried to pull my arm free, but his grip was iron tight. I don't think I'm qualified for whatever. You're the only one who raised their hand. He cut me off. That makes you qualified. Outside, his car was already running with the doors open. She said she had until Thursday. He kept muttering while speeding out of the school parking lot. The midwife isn't answering her phone I the door handle, calculating if I could jump out at the next red light. Mr Gonzales, you're scaring me. Should I call my mom? No. He swerved around. A car and I slammed into the window. No one can know. Put your phone away. Turn it off. I'm not turning off my phone, I shouted. But I did anyway. We were going 50 in a 25 zone and Mr Gonzales kept checking his mirrors like someone was following us. Finally, he pulled into a driveway of a small yellow house that definitely wasn't his. Listen to me. He grabbed my shoulders before we got out. They can't know she was here. Do you understand? No matter what happens, they can't know. I don't understand anything. I was practically yelling, now I'm 17. I don't even have my license yet. Marco. He used my name for the first time, his voice desperate. You've kept bigger secrets than this. I know your family. I need that same silence now. He wasn't wrong. I'd already seen two drive bys this year and never said a word to the cops. But this felt different. He shoved a pair of surgical gloves into my hands. Put these on. The front door was unlocked. Inside, we followed the sound of crying to a back bedroom where a woman was curled up on a bare mattress. She looked young, maybe early 20s, with long black hair stuck to her face with sweat. It's too early, she gasped in accented English when she saw us. Then she looked at me and started crying harder. He's just a child. You brought a child. I'm 17, I said. Stupid like that made any difference? I watch Grey's anatomy, if that helps. She switched to Spanish and started begging Mister Gonzales for something I couldn't understand. He pushed me toward her. Check how dilated she is. What? I backed up so fast I knocked over.

I'd spent four years raising her, loving her, fighting for weekend custody. What if she wasn't even mine? The thought made me sick, but I couldn't ignore it. A week later, another visitor, Brandon, Emily's brother. I need to tell you something, he said. I've been carrying this guilt for too long. I. What guilt? Lucy might not be yours. Emily was with Cole when she got pregnant. She never knew for sure who the father was. He just chose you. She chose me. You had the stable job, the house. Cole was broke. She picked the better option. I sat there stunned. I'm sorry, man. I should have told told you years ago. The rest of my time in jail was different. I wasn't defeated anymore. I had a mission. When I got out, I went straight to a lawyer. I need a paternity test and I want to sue for fraud. If she's not mine, we can do that. We set a court date. Two weeks later, I showed up for the test. Emily was already there with Lucy. She looked furious, arms crossed. Lucy saw me and ran over, wrapped her little arms around me. That hit me hard. I'd spent years thinking she was my daughter, raising her, loving her. Now I was about to find out if that was even true. Two weeks later, the envelope arrived. I tore it open. 0% I Wasn't her father? Just like that. Four years of my life felt ripped away. I called my lawyer immediately. I wanna sue Emily for fraud, for emotional damage, for every dollar of child support I paid. We can do that. I'll get the paperwork started. The court date arrived. I walked into the courtroom. My lawyer met me at the door. Emily was already seated, looking put together, but her eyes gave her away. She knew what was coming. The trial started. Emily went first, claimed she hadn't known who Lucy's father was, that she believed it was me. Tried to play the hero for keeping the secret to protect our family. Then my lawyer stood up. He laid it all out. The letter from Brandon, the paternity test, years of child support payments. And there's something else, your honour. My lawyer said Emily's boyfriend, Cole, is Lucy's biological father and she's been collecting child support from both of them. The courtroom gasped. Emily's face went white. The judge looked at the paternity test, then at Emily, then at me. Full story linked below on the channel.

I was devastated but also angry. We were supposed to travel to Europe next summer. She promised we'd finally do that sister trip we talked about for years. At her funeral, so many people I didn't know came up to me saying how much she talked about me, her brilliant little sister who was going places. It felt like they were talking about someone else's sister. Dad handed me her personal effects in a small box. Her phone was still working. I scrolled through her calendar and saw dozens of reminders about my life, my exam dates, my work presentation, even my dentist appointment next month. She had an alert set for my favorite band's new album release. I sat in my car for an hour just staring at these digital bread crumbs of her love. While cleaning out her apartment, I found this worn leather journal. Inside was her neat handwriting dated 16 years ago. The first entry was from when I was 7. Mom's not doing well. The doctor say she has weeks. She made me promise to look after sis. I'm only fifteen, but I swore I would. I never knew our mom was sick. Dad always told me she died suddenly from a heart condition. I kept reading. Every page detailed how my sister rearranged her entire life to keep her promise. She turned down her dream college because it Was too far from home. She worked nights so she could walk me to school in the mornings. She scheduled her classes around my activities so I'd never be alone. There was an entry from the night of that concert. She's so mad at me for showing up, but there were older guys hanging around. I'd rather have her angry than hurt. And about Ryan found out he got arrested for dealing. Can't tell her how I know. Dad's police friend tipped me off. She'll understand someday. The last entry was from the week before she died. Sometimes I wonder if she resents how much I'm in her business. But I promised mom I'd keep her safe. Maybe someday she'll understand it wasn't control, it was love.

I always thought my older sister was overprotective. Growing up, she'd walk me to school, even though her high school was in the opposite direction. She'd check my homework, pack my lunches, and always asked who I was hanging out with. It drove me crazy. When I was 13, I wanted to go to my first concert with friends. No parents, just us. She insisted on coming along, sitting rose behind us like some kind of shadow. I remember the burning embarrassment when my friend spotted her. I didn't speak to her for days afterward. In high school, she somehow always knew when I was hanging out with Ryan, this guy she thought was trouble. She'd conveniently need to pick me up early or would show up with some urgent reason. One night, she literally pulled me out of a party where there was drinking. I screamed at her in the car that she was ruining my life. She just gripped the steering wheel tighter and said, hate me now if you need to. When I moved away for college, she'd call every Sunday without fail. She'd ask about my classes, if I was eating right, did I need money for books. I'd rush through these calls, annoyed at her constant hovering. Sometimes I'd accidentally miss her calls, texting later with flimsy excuses. For my 21st birthday, she surprised me by flying cross country. I had plans with friends. That weekend. But she'd already booked us tickets to this play I'd mentioned once months before. I reluctantly canceled my parties. She seemed so happy during that weekend that I couldn't bring myself to tell her how much her visit had disrupted my life. Last year she planned this huge family reunion for our parents anniversary. I complained the whole time about taking time off work. She just smiled and said, family is everything, kiddo. During that weekend, she pulled me aside and made me promise to come home for Christmas. No excuses this time, she said, hugging me tighter than usual. I promised half heartedly.

But I wanted to do more than just get him kicked off. I started documenting everything. I took screenshots of him changing my playlists, recorded videos of songs suddenly switching while I was using the app, and even got my friend to witness him controlling my music from across the classroom. Then I found out something interesting. Ben had been bragging to other people about hacking not just my account, but several other students accounts too. He thought it was hilarious that he could mess with people's music and make them look stupid. So I reached out to those other kids and found out they had the same experience. Random music playing at inappropriate times, embarrassing songs showing up in their recent activity playlists, getting messed with. Some of them had even gotten in trouble with their parents when explicit songs started playing through their home speakers. We all decided to report this together. But instead of just going to Spotify, we went to the school administration first. Turns out what Ben was doing counts as cyberbullying and harassment. And our school has a zero tolerance policy for that kind of stuff. The school called his parents and mine for a meeting. When they showed all the evidence we had collected, Ben's face went completely white. His parents were furious because they had no idea their son was using his computer skills to torment other students. But here's where it gets Really good. The school decided to involve the police because technically what Ben did was unauthorized access to other people's accounts, which is actually illegal. They called it computer fraud and abuse. Ben started crying and begging everyone not to press charges. He promised he would stop and even offered to help us secure our accounts better. But it was too late. The damage was done and we were all fed up with his behavior. The police officer explained that even though we were all minors, this kind of digital harassment was taken seriously. Ben ended up getting charged with multiple counts of unauthorized computer access and cyberbullying. His parents had to hire a lawyer and pay thousands of dollars in legal fees. He got suspended from school for two weeks and had to do community service. The court also ordered him to stay away from all of us and prohibited him from using any social media or streaming services for six months.

So there's this kid at school named Ben who thinks he's some kind of tech genius. He's always bragging about how he can hack into anything and showing off with his fancy coding skills. Most people just ignore him, but he made the mistake of targeting me last month. I was sitting in the library working on an essay when Ben comes over and starts looking at my laptop screen. I had Spotify open in another tab because I was listening to music while I worked. Starts laughing and says my playlist is trash and asks if he can show me some real music. I said no thanks and went back to my work, but Ben doesn't take no for an answer. He pulls out his phone and starts typing away and suddenly my Spotify starts skipping songs. Then it switches to some death metal band I've never heard of. I look at him and he's got this smug grin on his face, whispers that he's connected to my account and can control it from his phone. Then he starts blasting the volume up and down just to mess with me. The librarian comes over and tells me to keep it down, which was embarrassing because everyone was staring. I told Ben to stop, but he just kept going. He changed my playlist name to something stupid and started adding weird songs to it. When I tried to change it back on my laptop, he Would just override it from his phone. It was like playing tug of war with my own account. The worst part was when he started following random people on my account and liking their playlists. Some of them were really inappropriate ones with explicit names. I was mortified because all my friends could see this stuff in their activity feed. After about 20 minutes of this torture, I finally had enough. I grabbed my stuff and left the library. But even at home he was still messing with my account. Songs would randomly start playing in the middle of the night or my playlists would get deleted and recreated with terrible music. This went on for three days. Ben would walk past me in the hallway and smirk, knowing he had complete control over my Spotify. He even changed my profile picture to some meme of a crying baby. I tried changing my password, but somehow he still had access. That's when I came up with my plan. I did some research and found out that Spotify has a feature with

My 10 year old son came home confused because his history teacher told the class that the Great Wall of China is visible from space with the naked eye. My son Alex has always been fascinated by space. Since he was five, we've spent countless nights stargazing with our telescope. He knows all the planets and can recite facts about the International Space Station. Last year, I bought him a book signed by Chris Hadfield, the famous astronaut. Alex treasures it and can quote entire passages about what earth actually looks like from space. But everything changed when Mr Peterson started teaching history during a lesson about ancient wonders, told the class that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space with the naked eye. Alex raised his hand and explained that astronauts have confirmed this isn't true. The wall is too narrow and blends with the landscape. He mentioned that Hadfield's typically addressed this myth in his book. Mister Peterson cut him off. That's nonsense, he said. It's in our textbook and I've been teaching this fact for 20 years. Your little astronaut book is wrong. The next day, Alex brought in his signed book to show the passage. Instead of listening, Mister Peterson confiscated it, calling it disruptive material. He made Alex stand in front of the class and recite the Great Wall of China is visible from space. 10 times. When Alex came home, he was devastated. His precious signed book was gone and he felt humiliated. Mister Peterson had assigned a 5 page essay on the importance of respecting teacher's knowledge as punishment. I was furious. I emailed Mister Peterson explaining the facts and asking for the book back. His response, I don't need space facts from a parent. The curriculum says the wall is visible from space. That's what I teach. The principal seemed reluctant to contradict a 10 year teacher over what she called a minor factual dispute. That's when I decided to take action. My college roommate now work.

Then came the night of the storm. Lightning killed the power and we ended up in the garage trying to fix the breaker. I started talking about my dad, about the dumb jokes he told, how he once bought a Hawaiian shirt for a business casual event just to annoy my mom. Caleb laughed, an actual genuine laugh, and he got really quiet. I used to see him, he said, at school when he picked you up. I always knew who he was. I asked what he meant by that. He said, my mom told me not to talk to him ever, said it would mess everything up. He just glared at me until I told him I had no idea what he was talking about. He got really confused and said something that shocked me to my core. He said, your dad? He was my brother. I just stood there frozen. Explained how my grandfather paid his mom off to never say anything and never told his wife or my dad that he existed. But his mom told him when he was young about the entire situation. She admitted she was really hard on him. She constantly insisted that the name, the house, the family, it should belong to him, not me. I felt the floor tilt beneath me. I said, you bullied me because you were jealous. He flinched and said, no, yes, I don't know. I hated you because you had Everything. I wasn't allowed to want a dad who loved you, a real home. I wanted a brother, but I wasn't allowed to be with the one I had. We sat in silence once, not out of avoidance, but grief muted and shared. Later that week, I pulled out an old photo album, showed him pictures of my dad in a Santa suit falling off the roof because he thought it'd be funny to land on the sleigh. Caleb laughed until he choked. I told him that he and my dad had the same laugh. The tension between us didn't disappear, but it shifted into something else. Not friendship, not yet, but maybe family.

Now I know why I didn't cry at my grandfather's funeral. Not because I wasn't sad, I was just numb. My parents died 3 years ago in a car crash I'm still pretending didn't ruin me. Grandfather was the last thread connecting me to anything that felt like home. when the lawyer handed me the will and said I'd inherited the estate, I didn't feel joy, just more weight. But there was a catch. Of course there was. The lawyer said to claim full ownership, you'll need to live on the property for one year with another party also named in the will. And that other party turned out to be Caleb, the same Caleb who used to shove my face into my mashed potatoes in the cafeteria for an hour in 8th grade. Childhood bully. I laughed at the lawyer and said, this has to be a joke. That's when he walked in wearing a weathered leather jacket with his arms crossed and a face like he'd rather be anywhere else. Caleb said, trust me, if it is, I'm not laughing either. Neither of us wanted to spend our time together, but free housing in this economy was no joke. So we both signed and moved in. We avoided each other like a mouse would avoid a cat, only neither of us knew who the cat was. The house was massive enough that We barely crossed paths until the peanut thing. I was eating trail mix in the kitchen when he walked in, froze and said, you trying to kill me? I blinked and said, you allergic? He said, all it would take was one whiff and it's Epipen and ambulance time. I told him that my dad had the same allergy. Caleb's eyes flicked to mine and something passed there, something like recognition, guilt. It was gone before I could catch it. The days dragged into weeks. We didn't speak much, but the silence began to change. It softened. I caught him fixing the broken gutter one morning without being asked. Then I started leaving coffee on the counter for him as he rushed to work each morning.

Of crying with her. Of being present. What do you have, Frank? Proof that you're tough. Three sons who can't stand to be in the same room as you. Sarah started crying softly. Michael stared at his father, something unspoken passing between them. Frank grabbed his jacket. I'm leaving. No one stopped him. The door slammed. Silence. Then my aunt Sarah spoke, her voice breaking. He hasn't cried since his mother died 40 years ago. He was 19. His father told him to man up at the funeral. I think he's been trying to prove he could ever since. My mother reached across the table, squeezed my hand. Lisa would be proud of you. I nodded, tears falling freely. Now. Real men don't cry. Frank's words echoed in my head. But looking around the table at my family finally breathing, finally real with each other, I realized something. Real men do cry. They grieve, they hurt. They love openly. They show up. What they don't do is die alone, emotionally bankrupt, wondering why their children don't visit. Frank never apologized, never came back. But two weeks later, his youngest son called me. I heard what happened at Thanksgiving. Thank you. For what? For saying what we never could. He's been impossible our whole lives. I paused. It's not too late, you know, for you to talk to him. I know, he said quietly. But I don't think I can. Not while he's still that Person. Christmas came. Frank and Sarah's house was quiet. Just the two of them. My mother said Sarah invited them to join us, but Frank refused. Too proud, too stubborn. Too afraid to face what I'd exposed. Meanwhile, I hosted dinner. Michael came, brought his kids. Sarah came too. Without Frank. We talked. We laughed. We cried when someone mentioned Lisa's pumpkin pie. And it was real. Messy and painful and beautiful and real. That night, as everyone left, Michael pulled me aside. I called my dad yesterday. Told him I'd visit if he. Just talk. Really talk. No lectures, no toughness. Just honesty. He hung up on me. I'm sorry. Don't be. Michael said you were right. He chose this. He chose toughness over connection, pride over love. And now he's got exactly what he built. An empty house and a reputation. I think about Frank sometimes. About how terrified he must be of his own emotions. How exhausting it must be to perform strength every moment of every day. But mostly I think about Lisa. About how she taught me that crying isn't weakness. It's proof you love something enough to hurt when it's gone. Real men don't cry. No. Real men do. And they're stronger for it.

Then he laughed when I teared up talking about my late wife. So I asked him one question that made the whole table turn against him. Real men don't cry. My uncle Frank said it loud enough for everyone to hear. I've been talking about Lisa, my wife, how she used to make pumpkin pie from scratch every Thanksgiving, how this was the first one without her, six months since cancer took her. My voice cracked, my eyes watered, and Frank laughed. Oh, come on, you're gonna cry at the dinner table. Real men don't cry. My aunt looked uncomfortable. My cousins went quiet. My mother opened her mouth, then closed it. Frank just sat there, chest puffed out, like he'd said something profound. He'd always been this way, the tough guy, the ex Marine who never let anyone forget it. Emotions were weakness. Vulnerability was failure. He'd raised his sons with an iron fist and wondered why they never called. I wiped my eyes, took a breath. I said calmly, when's the last time one of your boys visited you? His smile faltered. What your sons? When did you last see them? The table went silent. Frank shifted in his seat. They're busy work families. Christmas, maybe, I continued. Was it Christmas or has it been longer? Frank's jaw tightened. That's none of your business. You're right, I said, but I'm curious. You've spent 30 years teaching them that. Real men don't show emotion. That crying is weakness, that vulnerability is failure. So I'm wondering, did it work? Are they strong men now? My Aunt Sarah's eyes dropped to her plate. My cousin Michael looked away. Everyone knew Frank's oldest son hadn't spoken to him in four years. The middle one called twice a year out of obligation. The youngest moved to Seattle and blamed work for never visiting. Frank's face reddened. You don't know what you're talking about. I do, actually. Lisa knew, too. Before she died, she told me something. She said, the strongest thing I ever did was cry with her, hold her hand and let her see my fear. She said it made her feel less alone. Frank scoffed. That different how I leaned forward. How is it different, Frank? She was dying. I was terrified. I cried. Does that make me weak or does it make me human? Because right now I'm wondering what makes someone so afraid of feelings that they mock a widower at Thanksgiving dinner? My mother finally spoke. Frank, that's enough. He's grieving. Frank stood abruptly. I don't have to sit here and be lectured. You don't. I agreed. Before you go, answer me this. When you're alone at night, when Sarah is asleep and it's just you and your thoughts, do you ever wonder why your sons don't call? Do you ever think maybe it's because they Learned from you that showing love is weakness, that needing someone is Failure. The room was frozen. Frank's hands trembled. You have no right. I have every right, I said quietly. I lost my wife, the woman I loved more than anything. And you know what? I have memory.

I read every single message out loud word for word. When I got to the garbage collector comments, I look directly at the mom who wrote them. Her face went bright red. Her daughter started crying. When I read the messages about Hazel's jacket and us renting, several kids looked confused and hurt. The room was completely silent except for my voice. When I finished, I said my husband keeps the city clean. He works harder than most people in this Room. And my daughter is the kindest, smartest kid I know. She deserved better than this. I sat down for 10 seconds. Nobody moved. Then Hazel's teacher, Missus Laura, stood up and started clapping. Slowly, other parents joined in. Not the group chat parents. They sat frozen. But at least a dozen families stood up applauding. After the meeting, a dad I'd never spoke can you came up to me. He had tears in his eyes. He said, my brother is a garbage collector in Phoenix. I'm ashamed I didn't speak up sooner. When I heard the whispers, another mom hugged me and said, we're having a pool party Saturday. Hazel is invited and so are you. Three days later, Hazel came home from school with five birthday cards from kids who hadn't been able to make it but felt terrible. The following Saturday, she went to that pool party. When I picked her up, she was soaking wet and smiling, bigger than I'd seen in months. The mean moms, their kids switched schools by winter break. Turns out nobody wanted to be friends with bullies.

I'm serious. She's not moving. Dad shook his head. We're not falling for another one of your tricks to get us to open the door. I just grabbed my phone and called 9 1 1 myself, hands shaking as I gave them the address. But as I was explaining who Missus Lane was, I saw black smoke starting to curl up from her stove, kettle, the gas flame. The smoke thickened, pooling against her ceiling, spreading through her kitchen. I knew that if Missus Lane started to choke, then the ambulance might not make it in time, so I had no time left to argue with my parents. I moved and triggered everything at once, slamming my body against the door, jumping in front of every sensor, creating absolute chaos. Alarms shrieked from every direction, the app probably exploding with notifications. There's a fire! I screamed over the noise. Mom was shouting at dad to find the system reset code, dad yelling he couldn't remember it, both fumbling with their phones. Smoke was pouring from Missus Lane's kitchen window now. I grabbed my metal desk lamp, eddied its heavy base solid in my hands, and started slamming it against the reinforced glass. Nothing. So I did it again. The frame started to splinter again. A crack appeared again and again and again, until the frame buckled and the glass hung loose. My parents burst in just as I was forcing my body through the jagged opening. Sophie, Stop! Mom lunged forward, then froze. Seeing the smoke billowing from next door, I hit the ground, running barefoot on wet grass, shoulder bleeding. Missus Lane's door was locked. I grabbed her garden gnome and shattered her kitchen window. The smoke poured out, black and choking. She was so light when I dragged her out, unconscious but breathing. Just as sirens filled the air. The fire captain stood in our living room, and hour later, his boots leaving ash prints on Mom's cream carpet. Three more minutes and the smoke inhalation would have been fatal. Your daughter saved that woman's life. He looked at my bandaged shoulder, then at my parents. So I've got to ask, why did she have to break through a reinforced window to get out of her room? Mom's face was pale, dad staring at the floor. The motion sensors came down that night.

My best friend Jenna has four daughters. They're 8, 6, 4, and 3 years old. Her husband, Kyle is one of those dads who looks great at birthday parties and soccer games when Jenna is standing right there. But the second she leaves him alone with all four kids, he completely shuts down. Like his brain stops working. Three weeks ago, Jenna got really sick. I brought over lasagna from Costco and garlic bread. We. We're all sitting at the dinner table eating when Jenna suddenly got up and rushed to the bathroom. The three year old jumped off her chair and ran after her mom. Then she came sprinting back, yelling that Mommy was throwing up in the toilet. All four girls bolted toward the bathroom. Kyle and I followed them. I got in there, and Jenna was hunched over the toilet looking absolutely terrible. Her face was gray and she was shaking. I grabbed a washcloth and helped her wipe her mouth, while Kyle just stood in the doorway doing nothing. I told him to go get her nausea medicine and a thermometer. He finally left, and I got Jenna sitting on the floor against the bathtub. When Kyle came back, I told him to take the kids out of the bathroom so she could breathe. He took them to the hallway. I put the thermometer in Jenna's mouth, and it read 103.8 degrees. I went to get Tylenol and water from the kitchen. When I walked back to the bathroom not even two minutes later, all four kids were crowded around their mom again because Kyle couldn't keep them in the hallway. I handed Jenna the pills and water. She swallowed them and immediately started throwing up again. Then her eyes rolled back and she passed out cold.

I spent three weeks planning Hazel's 10th birthday party. She'd finally made friends after we moved to this neighborhood six months ago, or so I thought. We decorated the entire backyard with streamers, set up a dessert table, rented a bounce house and even hired a face painter. Hazel had been so excited she could barely sleep the night before. She picked out goody bags for each kid herself, little soccer balls since her class was obsessed with the World Cup. The party was supposed to start at 1 war PM by 1:30, nobody had arrived. Hazel kept running to the front window saying, maybe they're just running late, mom. By 2:00, she came inside crying so hard she could barely breathe. She'd invited 22 kids from her fourth grade class. Not a single one showed up. I held her while she sobbed into my shoulder, asking over and over, what did I do wrong? I had no answer. My phone buzzed with a text notification. It was from a group chat called Missus Sanders's class parents that I didn't remember joining. Confused, I opened it. My stomach dropped. The messages went back 3 days. Is anyone actually going to Hazel's party? One mom wrote. Absolutely not. Another reply, why would we, someone else asked. Then came the message that made my hands shake. Her dad is a garbage collector. I don't want Skyler Around that. Imagine the smell they must have at home. The replies got worse. Trash can emojis, laughing faces. One mom wrote, I heard they rent, not own. Probably can't even afford this neighborhood. Another said, Hazel's always wearing the same jacket. So embarrassing. I couldn't believe what I was reading. These were educated adults, lawyers, doctors, real estate agents talking about a 10 year old child like us. My husband Adam worked six the hour weeks as a sanitation worker starting at 4:00am in the blazing summer heat and freezing winter cold. He did it so we could afford our house in their precious neighborhood, so Hazel could go to a good school, so we could give her opportunities. While I was reading, Hazel whispered from the couch, mom, did I do something wrong? Are they not coming because of me? That shattered me.

I own a restaurant that does catering on the side. Started it five years ago after culinary school. Built it up from nothing. Jake married my sister Rita when I was still washing dishes for minimum wage. Never supported the business. Called it a hobby that would fail. First year I was open, he showed up with 12 friends on a Friday night. No reservation, demanded the best table. Ordered everything expensive. Sent half back claiming problems that didn't exist. Bill came to $800. Family discount, right? He said I gave him 10% off. He complained to Rita that I was stingy. When I catered my cousin's baby shower, Jake ate three plates of food, then told everyone the seasoning was off. Still took home leftovers. Rida's birthday, I made a five course meal at their house. Jake critiqued every dish to his friends while eating seconds. Never said thank you. Never offered to pay for ingredients. When I won a regional cooking competition, Jake told people it was probably rigged because a judge knew Rida. The restaurant review in the paper called us the best new spot in town. Must be a slow news day, he said. But when his boss needed catering, suddenly I was the best chef in the family and he needed a favor. Did it at a cost because Rida begged. Jake took credit for Discovering me, his friends started calling for discounts. Jake said, you hook us up. I started saying no. Jake told Rita I was getting too big for my britches, forgetting where I came from. Where I came from was working three jobs to afford culinary school. The engagement announcement was at my parents house. Jake stood up during dessert. We've set the date for next June. And of course Alex will be doing the food as our gift. Everyone looked at me. I hadn't been asked. Rita looks surprised too. We haven't discussed this, I said. What's to discuss? You cater weddings. We're having a wedding for 200 people. That's a 15 thousand dollar job minimum. Exactly why we need family to help. Weddings are expensive. His parents chimed in. They were paying for everything else. Surely I could contribute this. Jake had already told everyone at their country club that his brother in law was handling the food. It would be embarrassing to change now. His mother said. I asked, what

She still thinks she's learning how to flirt. Trish started working at my waitressing job five months ago and from the moment she saw my boyfriend Kayo, she set her eyes on him like he was the last Infinity Stone. He was half Japanese like me, meaning we related on a deep level. And for some reason, Trish hated this the most. The first time she saw us having lunch, she made herself comfortable in my seat next to his. When I got up to use the bathroom, she pressed her hips against his and flashed a flirty smile before saying konichiwa. When he awkwardly set it back, she grabbed a pair of chopsticks and started eating noodles unsuccessfully complaining about whitewashed girls appropriating his beautiful culture, very obviously referring to me. When I came back from the bathroom, she told to grab a chair, telling me I was welcome to join in on their conversation. It definitely struck a nerve but I was so secure in Kaido and I's relationship, I didn't even mind until Trish started trying to implode us. She cornered him when I wasn't looking and tell him innuendo style phrases in Japanese that she got off Google translate. Whenever we were talking, she'd always squeeze past us very slowly, sometimes making sure to rub her behind against Kaido and other times facing him directly and giving him the effing eyes, the Thing that really made me mad was when she asked Kaido to come teach her Japanese at her house after work. I was going to confront her there and then, but we were in the middle of a very busy service and I told myself I'd do it right after. Big mistake. You see, at some point during service, these important Japanese business then came in for food. They were at my section, but Trish practically shoved me aside to serve them. Please speak Japanese. I understand everything, she told them. They looked pleasantly surprised and started rattling off their order with specific modifications and allergies. Trish just kept saying, hi, hi, while scribbling nonsense. 45 minutes later, it was chaos. One guy got served the wrong starter. Another received two sushi orders instead of his chicken chow Mein. And the third guy actually started having an allergic reaction to shellfish, which he asked to exclude. That's when Trish did it. While Kaido ran to get the Epipen, she pointed at me and told her cousin, who is the manager, that I changed the order to sabotage her. And without verifying anything, her cousin wrote me up on the spot in front of everyone. One more incident and you're terminated. I went home crushed and just cried to Kaido. I was wondering.

Our lead just got into an accident. The show started in less than an hour. At first I laughed. I thought it was some kind of cruel theater joke. I was just the prop guy, the one who taped broken swords, filled fake goblets, and made sure nobody tripped over stray cables. The closest I'd ever come to acting was whispering lines along with the cast from the wings. But the director wasn't joking. You've heard Mason's lines a hundred times, he said. You can do this. We open in 50 minutes. I don't even have a costume, I muttered. You do now, he said, tossing me a velvet tunic before rushing off. In the dressing room, my reflection looked like a parody of a king. With my collar crooked, sleeves too long, eyes too wide, my stomach churned. Laura, the lead actress, stormed in. You're serious? You're him tonight? Apparently. She exhaled through her nose somewhere between pity and disbelief. Alright, don't freeze. Just follow my lead. That was everyone's advice. Don't freeze. As if it were that simple. The first act was a disaster. I tripped over the hem of my robe, missed my cue, and called one of the Lords by the wrong name. The audience laughed. Not cruelly, but that made it worse. Laughter meant they knew I wasn't supposed to be there. By Act two, I'd Sweated through my costume. Lines slipped from my mind. The lights were too hot, the stage too wide, and every eye felt like a magnifying glass during a brief blackout. Laura hissed at me, get it together! You're tanking the show! I'm trying, I whispered. But the truth was, I wasn't sure I belonged anywhere near that stage. By the time Act 3 began, the play was dying a slow and painful death. Due to my lack of talent. The audience's polite smiles had turned into awkward silence. I could feel the director's glare drilling through me from the wings.

My phone rang as I crossed the Oklahoma border, tears rushing down my cold cheeks. I wipe the tears from my eyes, being careful of my black eye before pressing the green answer button on my Bluetooth. Hello, I asked Sierra. Mom's cold voice came through the car speakers loud and clear. What's this I hear from your husband? You left him for another guy? I froze in my seat, my hands trembling on the steering wheel. I spotted a rest stop up ahead and pulling into the parking lot. Sitting back in my seat with a sigh. That's what he told you, I asked quietly. I didn't leave him for another guy. Of course you did. Why else would you leave such a wonderful man like him? I snorted at her words. A wonderful man like him, I repeated. Tell that to my black eye. She paused and silence fell for a long moment. All I heard was her heavy breathing. Why are you lying to me? She finally asked. I laughed again. I'm not lying. I shook my head and remembered back to the first time my husband laid his hands on me in anger. I had burned dinner that he forced me to cook for him and he thought I did it on purpose, calling me lazy and stupid. Then he slapped me across the face. I told myself I would Leave him then. But he came back and apologized, giving me flowers and promising to never do that again. The next week, he broke my arm by shoving me down the stairs once again. He felt so bad about it and doted on me lovingly for weeks during my recovery. A few months later, I had forgotten to give him a message from his boss and he ended up losing his job because he. I missed an extra day of work. He beat me almost half to death because of that one. But every time he hurt me, I would tell myself to leave. But each time he would confuse me with dates and flowers and expensive things. He would love me like I wanted to be loved. But this time he went too far. He threatened to kill me. And there was something in his eyes that made me believe him. So I ran. I shook my head to clear it. Mom, he beats me all the time. I explained I had to get away to save my life. Mom, Scott, come home. Sierra.

When I was 10, my mom marched onto the playground and pushed a kid off a swing after he cut in line and took my spot. She later grabbed his arm while he sobbed and made him apologize in front of everyone. And I just stood there watching. I mean, I thought it was normal. Mom had always been involved, but around middle school, I quickly figured out that the things she did were a little more extreme. That day, I came home with a bee on a science project she had helped me with. She was furious. She called my teacher and spent 40 minutes arguing until my teacher gave up and turned it into an A just to get her off the phone. High school was even worse. She completely edited a college application essay that one of my teachers said was already perfect and ended up getting me waitlisted. And it wasn't just school, either. When my mom found out I had a crush on a boy, she found his parents on social media and asked them to set up a date. They were instant. He creeped out and tried to politely tell her no, but that was a mistake. You see, no was the word she hated the most. She stretched her fingers and took a deep, angry breath before proceeding to hurl insults into their chat until they had no choice but To block her, just to make her stop. Rumour about my crazy mom took over the entire school and for the rest of the year people were scared to even talk to me, even my friends. But now that I graduated college and started job hunting like a real adult, I thought maybe she'd cool down and give me space. But I was so wrong. She found my resume on my laptop and changed everything. She bragged about herself in the reference section, added skills and experiences I didn't have. Even replaced the email and phone number to hers. I only found out when one company emailed her instead of me. When I confronted her, she said I was just polishing it, but some of the things she had edited actually made me sound like a terrible person instead. The worst part was when she started harassing the HR departments of the company. If I'd applied to one. Recruiter actually told me during a phone screen that my mother had called twice that week. I didn't get a second interview. She scared off two internship opportunities the same way. Calling supervisors to follow up on my behalf, sending additional materials they didn't ask for. Basically hovering so aggressively that they assumed I couldn't function independently. I begged her to stop, but called me ungrateful. I just felt bad knowing that. Nobody wants you, she told me. But she backed away after that and actually let me do things on my Own. And finally I got an interview for my dream position. The salary was great, the benefits were even better, and there was

Then she hung up. I pulled my car back onto the highway and drove the rest of the way to my parents house. I froze when I saw my husband's car in the driveway. How did he get here so fast and why was he here? My legs shook as I got out of the car and headed up to the porch. Mom opened the door and ushered me inside. Ignoring my red face and black eye, I avoided eye contact with my husband when I entered the living room to find my entire family sitting there. The only family member I actually tolerated was my oldest brother who was a cop. He sat in the recliner by the fireplace and frowned when he saw my face, glancing at my husband with a raised eyebrow. Do you want to tell us why you left him for another man? Dad asked gruffly. I glanced around the room and realized that my family have already made up their minds to believe my husband. They didn't really care about the truth. That was when I knew what I had to do. I pulled out my phone that held all the evidence my husband abused me throughout our relationship, I said calmly, pulling up pictures. I passed my family and went directly to my caught brother, handing him the proof. I've been collecting images ever since the first time he slapped me. I won't be the victim again. The truth is That I left him because he promised to kill me next time and I was afraid for my life. I ignored everyone else, staring at my brother and pleading with him to believe me. He flipped through the pictures, growing angrier with everyone. Finally, he handed the phone back to me and stood to his full height, turning to face my husband. My husband paled and stood to run, but my brother cut off his escape. I'm calling my partner, he said firmly. I'm off duty right now, but my partner is not. You're going away for hurting my sister. I cut my family off. After that, my brother had me move in with him and he cut contact with the family, too. My husband's trial was long and horrible. I had to stand up there and explain everything he did to me. But in the end, he was convicted and went away for a very long time. It took some time for me to recover, but with my brother's help, I Learned to love again.

I decided not to tell my mom about it. The morning of the interview, I told my mom I was meeting a friend for coffee before driving straight to the office building. The interview had just started and it seemed to be going great. Olivia, the current marketing director, was funny and very professional. It seems like you'd really be a great fit for the team and company, she started saying. When the doors to her office suddenly opened and my mom walked in. She didn't even knock. She just sat down in the empty chair beside me and explain and that she wanted to be there to support me and make sure I presented myself properly. She turned to Olivia and smiled sweetly, don't mind me, just continue. Olivia looked confused and tried to continue it professionally. She continued where we left off and asked me about my previous marketing experience. Before I could answer, my mom cut in. She complained that the question was too vague and told me not to answer. Olivia looked at me with wide eyes while I stared back with an apologetic look. Her jaw clenched. She tried redirecting the question back to me, but my mom kept interrupting, correcting my answers, adding details that weren't even true. She even called Olivia's questions basic and uninspired, how she expected more from a director level position. she turned to me and started asking me difficult interview questions only to Get angry. When I couldn't answer, that's when I had it. I was done. I interrupted my mom mid question and told her to leave. Her face turned red with rage. How dare you speak to your mother like this? You're clearly not ready for this job if you can't handle a simple interview, she shouted as if she were the one in charge of hiring me. Olivia stood up and pointed at the door. You're the one who's being rude. Before you stepped in, I was already practically handing your daughter a job offer before you stepped into this room and started running your mouth and taking over. But this ends here. I'm the director and you're no longer welcome here. Olivia called in security. My mom gripped the door frame, screeching about discrimination and abuse as they dragged her out. Rest gave Olivia the full picture of what I've been dealing with. She offered me the job and said anyone who could stay composed through that deserved a chance. She even helped me find temporary housing. So for three months, my life was exactly what I'd always dreamed it would be. I worked hard, made real friends, built my career without anyone interfering. But then came the court date for her trespassing charges. I thought it would be simple, just a formality until Mom's lawyer stood up and presented her evidence against me.

I don't speak the language, but their tone sounded secretive. The other tech kept glancing at me and shaking her head like she disagreed with whatever Amy was saying. Then the salon owner walked over. This tiny Vietnamese woman who's usually super sweet and always remembers my name, but when she saw my nails, her face went completely white. She started yelling at Amy in Vietnamese. Get louder and more upset by the second. Amy was trying to defend herself, but the owner was having none of it. The entire salon went dead silent. Every conversation stopped. All the nail dryer seemed to pause at once. Even the music felt quieter. Everyone was staring at our station trying to figure out what was happening. I was sitting there with these horrible nails, feeling like I was in the middle of some drama. I didn't understand. The. The owner turned to me and asked to see my nails up close. When I showed her, she actually gasped. She grabbed Amy's supply tray and started examining the polish bottles. That's when she found it. Amy had been using practice polish, the cheap stuff they use when training new techs. It's basically coloured water that's never supposed to touch paying customers. But it gets worse. The owner kept digging through Amy's Supplies and found a whole stash of expired products. Polish that had separated, base coats that had gone bad, top coats that were thick as glue. Apparently, Amy had been using The old expired stuff on certain clients and pocketing the difference when the salon charged for premium services. The owner was furious. She started demanding to know how long this had been going on and which clients Amy had been scamming. Amy finally broke down and admitted she'd been doing it for three weeks. She was trying to save money for her boyfriend's birthday and figured no one would notice if she used the cheap supplies on clients who seemed less important. The owner immediately fired Amy on the spot. She made her leave through the back door so she wouldn't cause more of a scene. Then she personally removed my botched manicure and redid it herself using the good products. She refused to let me pay and gave me a gift certificate for three free services as an apology.

I was getting my nails done for my cousin's wedding. Nothing fancy, just a basic French manicure. The place was packed on a Saturday afternoon. Nail texts, chatting with clients, music playing, typical salon noise. I've been going to the same salon for two years and knew most of the workers. My usual girl wasn't there, so they assigned me to this new tech named Amy. Amy seemed nervous from the start. She kept looking around the salon while she worked, almost like she was scared someone would catch her doing something wrong. When I asked for the French tips, she got this weird look on her face and started mumbling about how maybe I should pick a different color instead. I thought it was strange but figured maybe she was just new and wasn't confident with French manicures yet. Then she started applying the white tips and I noticed something was off. The polish looked chunky and was separating on the brush. It was going on all streaky and uneven. When I mentioned it looked a bit thick, Amy got defensive and said that's just how French manicures look, but I'd gotten dozens of them before and this definitely wasn't right. That's when I heard whispering from the station next to me. The client was getting these gorgeous gel nails with perfect French tips that looked nothing like the mess Amy was putting On mine, I glanced over and saw the tech using completely different products, brand new bottles, expensive looking gel polish, while Amy was using what looked like old, crusty regular polish that had probably been sitting around for months. I started paying closer attention to what was happening around the salon. Three other clients were getting French manicures and they all looked perfect, clean, white tips, smooth application, professional results. Meanwhile, my nails looked like a kindergarten had painted them with craft paint. The white was bumpy, yellowing and already starting to chip at the edges. I asked Amy why mine looked so different from everyone else's. She got all flustered and said something about different nail types requiring different products. But I've had these same nails for 26 years and they've never required special chunky polish before. Something was definitely up during the drying process. I pretended to look for something in my purse, but was actually listening to Amy talk quietly with another tech.

I know that sounds weird coming from a white girl, but hear me out. This whole thing started about three years ago when I was living in Atlanta for my internship. My usual salon back home was, like, four hours away, and I was desperate for a trim because my hair looked like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. My roommate Keisha, was getting ready to head out to her salon and saw me struggling with my massive curls in the bathroom mirror. She just laughed and said, girl, come with me. My stylist will sort you out. I was hesitant because I'd never been to a black salon before, but honestly, my hair was so bad, I would have tried anything. Walking into that salon was like entering a whole different world. The energy was incredible. Everyone was talking, laughing, music playing, kids running around while their moms got their hair done. It felt alive in a way that the quiet, sterile salons I was used to never did. The stylist, Miss Janet, took one look at my hair and shook her head, baby, who's been cutting your hair? Because they need to stop. She started running her fingers through it, asking me about my routine, what products I used, how I dried it. Nobody had ever asked me those questions before. They just wet it, cut it, and send me on my way. Miss Janet spent two hours on my hair. Two hours. He deep conditioned it, trimmed each curl individually, showed me how to scrunch it properly, and sent me home with specific instructions about what products to use and how often to wash it. My hair looked better than it ever had in my entire life. But here's the thing that really got me. She charged me $40. 40. The salon back home charged

Their curiosity spiked. Stop that filthy animal! The lead officer screamed, red faced. Stop him before we call the police! This. This is insane! I can't! I whispered, panicking, hardly able to form words. Abner, no! But then something unexpected happened. The lead officer froze, eyes wide and a strange grin spread across his face. He bent slightly toward Abner. You know how to talk, don't you, sweet boy? Abner squawked, almost as if responding, tilting his head one by one. The other officer's expression softened. Then laughter burst from them, loud, uncontrollable, and completely unexpected. Squawk! Squawk! You know how to talk, the lead officer mimicked, waving a hand at Abner, who responded with another squeaky, proud squawk. My shoulders relaxed slightly, though my heart was still pounding in disbelief. I laughed too, a nervous, relieved laugh that quickly turned to genuine. Abner hopped up and down lightly on my shoulder, pecking his feathers as thoroughly enjoying the attention. The tension that had once overcome the park moments ago seemed to disappear completely. You're off the hook this time, miss, the lead officer finally said, shaking his head but still laughing. But you better take that thing to a vet. Rabies shot, check out the works. We've never seen a crow like this. Are you sure? I asked, my voice trembling despite the relief running through me. Yes, but keep him away from me next time, another officer added, still Laughing under his breath, I exhaled. Abner ruffled his feathers happily. Letting out one last squawk. I stroked his head, whispering, see, I told you we'd be okay. The park returned to its usual hum children laughing, joggers passing, birds chirping. But for me, nothing felt ordinary. Abner wasn't just a pet. He was a protector, a companion, and somehow a hero. That day, a simple walk in the park had turned into an adventure I would never forget. And as the officers drove away, still chuckling at the sight of a crow talking back to them, I realized just how lucky I was, not only to have Abner, but to have him by my side when the world seemed ready to take him away.

Malcolm, she was screaming. Actually screaming. What did you do? I own every single vendor you hired. Every single one. You've been paying my companies this entire time? But. But we paid deposits. Almost $100,000 in deposits you're getting back. Minus my 75 grand. Use it to find new vendors. Good luck booking anything decent with 3 weeks notice. Mom was crying now, Malcolm, please. Harper's been talking about this for months. She didn't do anything wrong. Did Harper know you uninvited me? She. Malcolm, that doesn't matter. Did she? No. More silence. Then quietly, she said the photos would look better with just her. Then she can have her party on a park bench for all I care. Malcolm. Dad again? Desperate now? Your sister's friends, our friends. Everyone will. Everyone will what? Find out you can't actually afford the lifestyle you've been fronting? That your son you've been trash talking for 20 years actually owns half this city? Where are your parents? No, your Harvard parents. You made that clear. When I was seven, I could hear mom sobbing in the background, dad breathing hard like he'd been running. What do you want? Dad finally asked. Money and apology. I thought about every birthday party, every graduation, every Celebration. I've Been pushed out of because I didn't fit their image. I want you to tell Harper the truth. All of it. Who paid for her party, who owns the vendors, and who you really are. and I want you both to admit something you've never been able to say. What? That I'm your only successful child. Say it to me, to Harper, to your country club friends. Tell them I'm the only one of your children who doesn't live off daddy's money. The silence was deafening. We can't. Then enjoy explaining to 150 guests why there's no party. Wait. Dad's voice cracked. I smirked. Come to my office tomorrow, 9:00am. Your office? Excellence Events headquarters. The building you pass everyday downtown. The next morning, they walked into my conference room. Harper was with him, her face swollen from crying. Say it, I said. No greeting, no small talk. Dad looked at the floor. You're successful. To my face. He raised his eyes. You're successful. Did you hear that? She nodded. Now the rest. Mom spoke up, her voice cracking. You're more successful than Harper. And you're our only successful child. Good. Now you can explain that to your 150 guests with no venue. But you said. I lied. Just like you did for 20 years.

My sister took off running and my mom went right after her. My sister tried to grab the bucket from the kid's hands. The dad pulled his son away and my sister was screaming, you don't even care about figment. You're just gonna throw that away in a week. My mom shoved the dad so hard he stumbled backwards. Then she lunged at the kid and grabbed the bucket. Kids started wailing. The other mom tried to grab it back and my mom yanked it away so hard the handle broke. My sister dropped to her knees sobbing, no, you broke it. Then she looked up at me with pure hatred. This is all your fault. If you had run when I told you to, we would have been ahead of them. Disney security showed up and escorted us past hundreds of people who were recording and Staring. My sister was crying so hard she could barely walk. And my mom was arguing with security the entire time. We got taken to some office where a supervisor explained that we were banned from all Disney properties. Mom tried to argue that my sister has a medical condition. My daughter needs this popcorn bucket for her mental health. My dad was sitting in the corner with his head in his hands. My sister was on her phone looking up resale prices for the bucket and crying harder every time she refreshed. The supervisor said we needed to leave immediately and that if we tried to come back, we'd be arrested for trespassing. They walked us out through a back exit. We had dinner reservations that night that cost $400 and we missed it because we spent three hours getting banned from Disney World. We drove back to the hotel in complete silence except for my sister sobbing in the back seat. My mom kept saying that family is going to sell that bucket for hundreds of dollars. That's why they wanted it so badly. I checked my phone and my sister had posted a five paragraph ran about Disney discriminating against adults and how I ruined her life by not caring about her passion. My mom had already commented, so proud of you for standing up for yourself, baby girl.

The animal control truckled up as soon as the team saw me. I was taking my crow for a walk in the park, and he was sitting on my shoulder, relaxing, his feathers catching sunlight. I was shaking so hard. No license, no paperwork. Just me and him. My heart pounded so hard I thought it might give me away before I could even open my mouth. May I help you, miss? One of the officers leaned out the window, his eyes moving between me and Abner. Do you. Do you have a license for him? The officer went on, frowning as his partner stepped a bit closer. No, I whispered, hugging Abner tighter. But he's harmless. Really smart. The officer's eyes thinned. Miss, you need a license for that animal. Wild pets can be dangerous. You can't just walk around with him in public. My stomach dropped. He's fine, I said, trying to keep my voice steady. He's trained. You won't. Sorry, miss, but we have to take him in for an examination to make sure he doesn't carry any diseases. My chest went tight, and for a second I froze. But there was no way I was letting them take Abner without a fight. The lead officer's face went white. Hand him over now. Or else what? I snapped, my voice shaking. You'll be taken in for questioning. Either way, he comes with us. Never! I yelled, running down the park pathway. My feet barely touched the pavement as I ran as fast as I could, passing by joggers and picnickers who were just staring at us. Behind me I could hear the officer shouting, catching up with me. My mind raced. What could I possibly say to keep Abner miss? The officer shouted again. Closer! This time! My lungs burned. I suddenly stopped, holding Abner tight to my chest. I swear, officer, I really do have a license for him! I cried. Abner's been my pet for years. He's my emotional support animal. Please, please don't take him away! Abner flapped his wings and let out a series of sharp swawks. His claws tapped my shoulder as if asking me to hold still. Then, without warning, he moved forward, pecking at the closest officer's uniform. It was mass chaos. Arms waved, shouts echoed across the park. People near

Don't take this the wrong way, but we think it's better if you don't come to your sister's gacha day. The club just started allowing mixed families. We're not pushing it by bringing both of you. You see, Harper was my adopted sister. White skin, blonde hair that didn't move, perfect blue eyes. And I was their mixed race son with black skin that couldn't be bleached. I thought if I funded her day, they'd see me differently. Dad jumped in. Look, we already allocated your contribution to other expenses. Anyway, the $75,000 you sent is being put to good use. They didn't know that the venue, caterers and florists all had one thing in common. Me as their boss. So you're keeping my money but not inviting me? It's Harper's day, mom said simply. You understand? I go and mustard out a yes before hanging up. That's when I decided my family was about to learn what happens when you bite the hand that feeds you. I thought back to my childhood. Mine and Harper's birthdays fall on the same month, two weeks apart. Harper's parties cost five grand with a bounce house and catered food. Mine was a grocery store cake mom forgot to pick up until six PM because of budget issues. By the time Harper hit high school, I was basically invisible unless I did something wrong. Like when she threw my Xbox down the stairs during an argument. My parents told me, it's just a game, Malcolm. Grow up. But when I accidentally scratched her bike, grounded, and had to pay for repairs out of my allowance. An hour after they hung up on me, my phone rang. It was Celia, the event coordinator of my company. Mister Malcolm, your family just called about your sister's Celebration. What now? They want to ensure all food is appropriate for their real guests, not urban preferences. They were very specific about menu changes. Celia, can we still cancel their entire booking? Cancel? Sir, their event is in 3 weeks. What exactly have they booked with us? The Skyline Ballroom, Golden Catering, Divine Flowers, our transport fleet, photographers. Sir, they've booked nearly $200,000 in services. I laughed. I couldn't help it. My parents had hired my entire company while trying to keep me out. Cancel everything. Silence then, sir, cancel it all. Venue, food, flowers, everything. Send them a notice that their event has been terminated due to violation of our inclusion policy.

My sister has been obsessed with Disney since we were kids, but it got really bad after college. She's 24 now and has an annual pass even though we live in Ohio, which means my parents fund her monthly trips to Florida. Her room looked like a Disney store exploded in it. She has hundreds of collector pins covering every surface and a shrine to pigment the dragon in the corner. She even tracks limited edition merchandise on a spreadsheet. My parents pay for everything because she claimed she was building a business selling Disney content, but her Instagram only had 200 followers. I wanted nothing to do with this weird Disney worship, but my mom somehow guilt tripped me and to going on a family trip with them. The trip was a nightmare from day one. My sister had a full itinerary planned down to the minute, including which bathrooms we were allowed to use. She cried twice before lunch on the first day because a character meet and greet line was too long. My parents just kept apologizing to her and buying her stuff to calm her down. By day three, I was looking at flights home. That's when my sister burst into my room at 6:00am. The segment bucket drops tomorrow, she said like she was announcing someone died. She made us sit through a 45 Minute presentation about how we were going to obtain the bucket. My mom was taking notes and my dad asked if we needed walkie talkies. When I said it's just a popcorn bucket, my sister's face went red. You don't get me. You never have. My mom squeezed my arm. Please just support her. The next morning, we got to Epcot two hours before it opened. When the gates opened, everyone started power walking toward the store. My sister was practically running and my parents were right behind her. I was walking at a normal pace because as I don't run for anyone. When we got in line at the store, it was already wrapped around the building. My sister was on her phone refreshing five different Disney Facebook groups and doing breathing exercises. My mom was next to her saying, you're doing so good, baby. We're almost there. When we finally got close to the front, a cast member came out.

Every Sunday for 15 years, my grandmother made the same announcement at family dinner. When I pass away, everything goes to whoever visits me most. She tap her cane on the floor, smile like she just revealed state secrets. This turned my entire extended family into vultures. My Aunt Rachel drove three hours every Tuesday just to vacuum Grandma's living room. Uncle Steve called twice daily asking about her arthritis. My cousin Jennifer moved back from California and started doing Grandma's grocery shopping. They all hated each other, but pretended to be saints around her. Meanwhile, I was banned from inheritance discussion. I liked guys and chicken nuggets, and grandma made it crystal clear that sinners don't deserve family money. She'd change the subject whenever I entered rooms. My cousins would smirk and whisper about how I'd be working at McDonald's while they lived in luxury. But here's what none of them knew. I actually loved spending time with grandma. Not for money, she'd already told me I wasn't getting any, but because she was genuinely funny. When she wasn't performing for the Inheritance Hunters while they argued over who deserved what, I'd sneak over on Wednesday nights to watch old movies and eat ice cream. Grandma would relax completely when it was just us. She'd tell dinosaurs jokes from the 2000 BC and complain about how fake everyone was being. She even started asking about My boyfriend and seemed genuinely interested in our relationship. I never mentioned these visits to anyone because I knew they'd think I was scheme. After she passed last year, the whole family gathered for the will reading. Rachel brought a calculator. Steve wore his funeral suit from 1995. Jennifer had already started planning her European vacation. They were practically drooling as the lawyer opened the envelope.

I slowly unclipped my security badge and identification card, placing both items on the stainless steel prep counter while our senior aquarist and two night staff members watched this confrontation unfold in stunned silence. I pulled out my phone to start recording and told Caroline that Poseidon was in full hunting mode because it was feeding time and Tim knew where all the equipment was stored. Caroline's face turned bright red when she realized I was documenting our conversation for legal purposes. If you walk out of this building, you're terminated immediately and permanently. I replied calmly that this was perfectly fine with me, already hearing Poseidon's agitated flashing echoing from the deep sea exhibit two rooms away. I'm recording this for unemployment documentation. Since you're firing me for refusing to endanger a four million dollar animal and potentially injure your completely inexperienced employee, I walked out of the building and barely made it to the parking lot before my phone started buzzing with frantic calls and text messages. Twelve missed calls came in during the first four minutes, starting with panicked messages from our senior aquarist describing how Poseidon had grabbed Tim's entire arm through the feeding slot and refused to let go.

I was the only night keeper at our aquarium who could handle Poseidon, our four million dollar giant Pacific octopus. And that evening he wrapped all eight arms around my forearm to gently pull crab from my beating tongues. His massive 200 pound body moved with surprising Grace through the crystal clear water of his tank. But when any other keeper approached, the same gentle creature became a destructive nightmare that sprayed black ink everywhere and destroyed thousands of dollars it's worth of equipment. Our new operations director Caroline watched from the observation deck with her arms crossed, clearly unimpressed by what she called my animal dependency problem during yesterday's staff meeting. She believed every creature should have multiple handlers because no single employee should be irreplaceable, especially not because of some oversized sea creature that cost more than most people's houses. Caroline had spent three weeks documenting every minor violation she could manage. Manufacturer writing me up for wearing a different brand of reef safe sunscreen than the one corporate required even though their brand gave me hives and docking my pay. When Poseidon's complex eating routine ran five minutes over my scheduled break, her masterpiece was hiring Tim, her former assistant manager who spent entire shifts taking Instagram selfies near the shark tank and had never worked with cephalopods in his 24 years of existence. Poseidon hated Tim with a burning intensity of a thousand suns shooting Pressurized water jets that soaked him completely whenever he approached the tank. And once Tim slipped so dramatically on the wet observation deck that he crashed through a three thousand dollar interactive display about octopus intelligence. Tim's solution was to stand 15 feet away from the tank and throw food pellets like he was feeding pigeons at the park, which made Poseidon retreat to his cave and refuse to eat for two entire days. A disaster struck on a Wednesday evening when major marine research donors were arriving for a private feeding demonstration at 8:30, specifically requesting to see our famous octopus interact with his primary caregiver 20 minutes before the V I. P. Tour.

All parents help their children, actually, came a small voice from the back row. Connor said his mom made him start over four times until it was perfect. Missus Prescott's face hardened. Elizabeth, mind your own business. I knelt beside Connor's desk. Connor, what book are you reading at home right now? His eyes darted to his mother, then back to me. The one about the wizard boy, he whispered. Harry Potter, I asked. He nodded slightly. What page are you on? 12, he mumbled. But mom reads me the hard parts. Missus Prescott's phone began ringing. She answered immediately, turning away from us. Yes, I'll be there. The meeting's running late. When she hung up, I stood my ground. Missus Prescott, I believe Connor needs reading support, not Advanced Placement. I'd like to recommend. Unacceptable, she snapped, gathering her things. I expect that plan implemented by tomorrow or I'll take this to the principal and the superintendent and the school board. As she stormed toward the door, she called back. Connor, don't forget you have piano at 4, then swimming at 5:30, then math tutoring at 7. After she left, the room remained silent until little Elizabeth spoke up. Connor, want to come to my birthday party Saturday? We're having a water balloon fight. Connor looked up, his eyes brightening slightly. My mom says I'm allergic to water balloons. That evening, I stayed late preparing a detailed assessment of Connor's actual reading level, along with Research based interventions. When Missus Prescott arrived for drop off the next morning, I handed her a folder. Here's my plan for Connor. I gave you my plan already, she said dismissively. Mine includes Connor's input, I replied, and documentation that will go to the school psychologist if you continue to push your son beyond his developmental capabilities. Her face paled. Are you threatening me? I'm advocating for Connor. That's my job. Six months later, Connor was reading at grade level and building his own science projects. Mrs. Prescott still Blairs at me during parent teacher conferences, but Connor smiles.

I was just three weeks into my first year teaching third grade when Missus Prescott marched into my classroom 15 minutes before dismissal. She wore a crisp business suit and carried a leather portfolio like it was a weapon. The children were finishing their science projects. Paper mache volcanoes that had taken us all week. Miss Wilson, she announced loudly, not caring that 27 8 year olds turned to stare. We need to discuss Connor's grades. I smiled professionally despite the interruption. I'd be happy to schedule a conference tomorrow. This is. Prescott didn't move now. It's fine. Connor needs to be moved to the advanced reading group immediately. Connor, a sweet boy who struggled to read at grade level, louched in his chair, cheeks burning red. Connor's making wonderful progress, I said quietly, but the advanced group might be frustrating for him right now. She pulled a document from her portfolio and slapped it on my desk. I've outlined a new education plan for Connor. You'll implement it starting tomorrow. It wasn't a request. The 10 page document detailed a complete curriculum rewrite for just her son. Demanded I give him different homework, different tests and 30 minutes of private tutoring daily during my lunch break. Missus Prescott, I can't give Connor a separate curriculum from the rest of the class. Her eyes narrowed. My husband and I donate significantly to this school. Perhaps you don't understand how Things work here. The classroom had gone silent. 27 pairs of eyes watched us, including Connor's, which were now filling with tears. Let's discuss this privately, I suggested. There's nothing to discuss. Sign this, acknowledging you've received Connor's new learning plan. I glanced at Connor, who was now hiding his face in his hands. Then I noticed something, his science project. Unlike the other volcanoes, Connor's was immaculate with perfect lettering and advanced features the other children hadn't attempted. Connor, did you make your volcano yourself? I asked gently. Before he could answer, missus Prescott cut in.

She cried every day, sitting before an old bucket in despair. The family was so poor, the children had no pants to wear, using wooden barrels to cover their bodies as clothes. Inside the house, the walls were bare. Everything lay in ruins. Even the fish in the tank was so starved, only bones remained. When the woman opened the cupboard, there was just one plate and a single red bean, the only food for more than 20 people. Just then, dark clouds gathered overhead. The children rushed to the dining table, ready to eat. The woman was about to drop the red bean into the pot to cook and share among them, when one child stopped her, said he wanted to plant it instead. He carried the red bean into the yard, dug a hole with a shovel, buried it, covered it with soil and watered it. Soon the ground began to swell. A red bean vine sprouted, growing taller and taller, reaching high above the clouds. The boy grabbed the vine, said goodbye to his mother, and climbed upward until he reached the sky. In the distance, he saw a giant weighing over 500 pounds. The boy hid in the clouds, watching as the giant bathed, using the clouds like a shower. After bathing, the giant returned to his palace. He pulled a spring with all his might, and an iron ball shot out like A bowling ball lamps in the house lit up as it rolled into a hole, unlocking the gate to the sky castle. Once the giant entered, the boy followed the iron ball's path and slipped inside. In the palace, the giant walked slowly toward the golden egg production room. He grabbed the hen by the neck, looked under her, but found no egg. After a few slaps, the hen explained she was on her period and couldn't lay. The giant pulled her wings. Six cherries appeared in the hen's eyes, and a pile of giant golden eggs rolled out. The giant placed them under a cutting machine. Each golden egg was sliced into fragments, then stored inside a safe. After the giant left, the boy jumped down from the window, signaled the hen to stay quiet, picked her up, and prepared to escape. The giant heard the doorbell, dropped the safe, and chased after the chicken thief. In the end, the giant caught the boy, but the hen pulled out a large hammer and struck the giant hard on the head. Seizing the chance, the boy escaped with the hen. The giant chased them out of the palace. The hen hit him again with the hammer, knocking him down. The boy slid quickly down the vine back to the ground, the giant still in pursuit. Once on the ground, the boy in the hen grabbed an axe and chopped the vine. The giant fell crashing into the earth with a Huge impact leaving a massive crater and died instantly. Boy hugged the hen and returned to his mother. Then the hen laid a giant golden egg. The mother was overjoyed. They traded their worn out shoe house for a crystal shoe house and all the children rushed into their new home. The refrigerator replaced the old cupboard and inside was an endless supply of food.

But what hatched wasn't a chick. It was a baby Dinosaur. Still, the hen raised him as her own. The Newborn Dinosaur was hungry, so hungry it swallowed all the straw in the coop. In an instant, it grew several times larger, bursting straight through the roof. After that, the hen took the Dinosaur outside and taught him to hunt for insects. The Dinosaur mimicked her movements, digging eagerly for food, but mistook tree roots for bugs and swallowed an entire tree in one gulp. Again, he grew larger than before, now big enough to act like an umbrella, sheltering the chickens from the rain. The more the Dinosaur ate, the bigger he grew, until he finally broke the farmhouse completely. The farmer stared in disbelief, then quickly called for help to take the young Dinosaur away. Left alone, the Han guarded the damaged coup, breathing and waiting at the Dinosaur Circus. Crowds came from all around, but the Dinosaur's heart remained with his mother. He began a hunger strike in protest. The circus staff thought he was sick and called a doctor, who diagnosed him with a serious illness and gave him little time left. When the Han saw the news in the paper, she rushed to the circus at once. She called out to her young one again and again, but got no response. Just As she turned to leave, the Dinosaur's eyes suddenly opened, as if by a miracle. Overjoyed, the hen embraced him tightly. In the end, they performed together under the big top and spent the rest of their lives side by side, never to part again.

When the child was born, no one knew who the father was, not even the princess herself. Tom, in his 30, was always frowning, lost in uncertainty. In winter, he lay indoors daydreaming. In summer, he lay under the apple tree in the yard, gazing at the sky. One day, his mother asked him to fetch water from the river. He didn't want to go, but she kept nagging, adding that wearing dirty clothes would make people look down on him. Tom had had enough. He took the bucket to the river, filled it, and started back. On the way, he heard a faint voice. It turned out a small fish had accidentally been scooped into the bucket. The fish begged him to return it to the river. At first, Tom didn't want to turn back. But after the fish pleaded, he gently released it into the water. Grateful, the fish told him, no matter what difficulty you face, just think, little fish, come. I will appear and help fulfill your wish. Tom carried the water home. Feeling hungry, he told his mother he wanted to eat. She told him to make food himself. Disappointed, Tom remembered the fish.

Tom felt she was mocking him. Angrily, he summoned the fish and made the princess become pregnant. Back at the palace, the princess's belly grew day by day. Soon she gave birth to a boy. The king demanded to know who the father was, but the princess didn't know. She had never done anything improper. The king declared the child is already born. The father must be found a person and not get pregnant alone. Advisor suggested gathering every man in the country and having the boy offer each an apple. Whoever took it would be the father. The king. He agreed. The next day, all the men came, but even after the last man passed by, the father had not been found. Puzzled, the king began calling names house by house. Finally, soldiers found Tom hiding in an attic, still asleep. They brought him in and the boy handed the apple to Tom. The truth was out. The father was Tom. The king had expected a handsome prince, not the lazy, unkempt Tom. Furious, the king put the princess, Tom and the child into a wooden barrel and cast it into the river. At first, the princess cried every day, but she slowly adapted to life adrift. The barrel was too small. Living there was uncomfortable. She.

So he turned and asked the little ant for help. At first, the ant didn't want to bother with him, but then an idea struck and it agreed right away.

Just as he grew frustrated, he noticed the little ant nearby and a sly idea came to mind. He threw his hat into the water and pretended to panic, hoping to draw the ant's attention. The kind hearted ant heard Donald say the hat was very important to him, so without Hesitation, it climbed onto the fishhook to help. Seeing his plan succeed, Donald immediately began fishing. As the hook swayed in the water, a big fish soon appeared. Donald swiftly speared it with a fork. Meanwhile, the little ant was still dangling from the hook. It asked Donald to lower it again, so he repeated the trick and sure enough, caught another big fish. Even more absurdly, a whole school of fish began leaping up, trying to bite the hook. Luckily, the little ant noticed in time, or it would have been swallowed alive. Just as the ant was about to escape, it froze at what it saw, a whole pile of fish lying before it. That's when it realized Donald had been using it all along, though anger filled its heart. Faced with Donald's sincere apology, the little ant forgave him. Soon, the two enjoyed a meal together, eating all the fish they'd caught. Just then, Donald, who'd taken a nap, suddenly spotted a cruise ship nearby. Hearing this, the excited ant was about to take a look, but Donald suddenly dashed toward his raft. The aunt tried to follow, then noticed Donald's hat had fallen off. Thinking it should help pick it up, it turned around only to find Donald had already paddled away. The little aunt was about to shout after him, but suddenly stopped. It seemed to understand something. Just then, Donald tossed back the fishing line. It turned out he'd rushed off so fast to Stop the cruise ship. And he'd never forgotten his old friend.

But one day, fate gave her an extraordinary treasure. She went diving into the sea as usual. Suddenly, she noticed some strange boxes floating in the water. Everyone was curious about what might be inside. Then one of the boxes accidentally opened. Glittering gold bars spilled out, blinding everyone with their shine. The captain opened the rest of the boxes and they, too, were filled with gold. Everyone went crazy and jumped into the water to loot the treasure. But just then, a marine police boat sped towards them. Panicked, they he threw all the gold into the sea. In their attempt to escape, their anchor got stuck on a sea rock. A boy tried to untangle the rope, but suddenly it snapped and he lost his balance, falling into the sea. The captain immediately jumped in to rescue him. But by the time they got back to the ship, the police boat had reached them. The police boarded the ship and aimed their guns. They threatened the fisherman and ordered them to hand over the gold. It became clear that they weren't police officers at all. They were pirates. The treasure belonged to them and they wanted it back, along with the fisherman's lives. At that moment, a clever fisherwoman came up with a plan. She quickly swam to the surface and climbed out of the water. But one Of the pirates grabbed her foot and pulled her back down. At that moment, her companion knocked the pirate's knife out of his hand with a shell. The girl, see to the opportunity, cut the pirate's oxygen pipe and tied his foot to the rope. Her companion dragged the pirate toward the rocks, trapping him there. Gradually, the other fisherman arrived and cut the oxygen pipes of each pirate one by one. In the underwater battle, the pirates couldn't stand up to the fishermen and lost. But as soon as they emerged from the water, the fake police on the ship started shooting at them. One brave fisherman pushed a pirate with all his might, knocking him off the ship, but he fell off, too. The surprising thing was that the girl who had grown up in the sea, didn't know how to swim and faint it. Her companions pulled her onto the deck. Just then, the real pirate leader stealthily boarded the ship. He aimed his gun and ordered everyone to jump into the sea. The pirate opened the treasure chest and saw that along with the gold, there were also diamonds. He wanted to take everything. But one clever fisherman secretly tied the anchor rope to a rock. While the pirate was trying to operate the ship, another fisherman climbed up from the other side and grabbed a weapon. Suddenly, the rope snapped and the pirate fell into the sea. At that moment, the unconscious girl regained consciousness. The captain quickly started the ship and the fisherman made it safely out of there with a treasure. When they opened the boxes, not only did they find gold, but diamonds as well. The shine wasn't just from the wealth, it was from their victory and hope. In this way, ordinary fishermen who had worked only to fill their stomachs found honor and joy through the treasure they stumbled upon.

Which, according to Davy, meant dressing like a celebrity. Leaving LAX. Since the whole school now knew what a psycho liar she was, Davy felt like her only move was to be completely invisible. Perhaps until graduation. Her plan worked pretty well for a few days. That is, until she assumed Eric Perkins could remain upright for the length of a hallway. Oh, damn it! My Raisinets! It's where I get all my freaking vitamins! Ha ha! Coyote girl. I know your secret. You have a hot cousin. I saw her drop you off yesterday. You think she'd be into me? Um, she's kind of an arranged marriage, stitch. Just ask her. Anyway, for the first time, Davey was relieved to hear someone praise Kamala's appearance. Because it meant Trent did not know a real secret. In fact, no one seemed to know. Holy shit. Paxton didn't tell anyone she lied. Why was he protecting her? Did he care about her? Was he in love? Nope. He just forgotten about her. Hey, ladies. What's poppin? Seats taken? Don't hate me. I got cheese fries and chili fries for the tape. Jonah, since when are you guys friends? Since a couple days ago, when we became inseparable after coming out to Eleanor, Fabiola was still struggling with how to tell her family. Luckily for her, Jonah was struggling with the same thing. Jonah has been a really good friend to us and definitely hasn't yelled at us for no reason. I didn't yell at you guys. Yeah, she did. Trust me. Whatever you guys have going on, my shit's bigger, okay? I have the bigger shit. Okay? I guess it's fair to call that a yell.

On one side of the tape lived the mother and daughter, while the other side belonged to the father. Crossing that line was strictly forbidden. Whenever the father accidentally stepped on the tape, the mother would explode in anger. She would push him hard until he fell. He would quickly get up and try to explain it was just a mistake. But before he could finish, she would push him again, making his lunch box scatter across the floor. Out of control, she started throwing anything she could find, even the photo frame of their daughter, Emily. Ryan had grown used to these fights. He no longer reacted each time. He simply looked away in silence. Mother's obsession went so far that whenever Ryan's foot accidentally touched the tape, she would replace it immediately with a new one. Even if Emily crossed it by mistake, her mother would yell at her, too. During meals, the mother and daughter enjoyed delicious home cooked food, while Ryan had nothing but instant noodles. His eating corner was tiny compared to theirs. Even the staircase had a strip of tape dividing it. After taking a shower, he had to be extra careful not to step on the line. When Ryan returned to his small room, Emily often noticed his slippers touching the tape, so she would quietly place them back behind the line to keep her father from getting into Trouble again. The strangest part was that her mother had forbidden Emily from speaking to her father. If she was caught doing so, she'd get scolded badly. Still, Emily made up her mind before turning 18, she would uncover the secret behind that tape. The next morning, after seeing her father leave for work, she ran after him. Only once they were far from home could she finally say hello. That small greeting was something she could only share with him outside the house. After walking for a bit, Emily asked, dad, why is there a tape in our home? Ryan stopped walking and said softly that even he didn't really know. Maybe he once said something that hurt her mother deeply, and ever since then, things had been this way, but he couldn't even remember what he said and her mother never told him. Looking sad, Ryan turned to leave. But as he waited at a red light, suddenly someone pushed him hard from behind.

As soon as the lobster was cooked, the chef poured a thick sauce on it that looked like cement. This was the special feature of his master dish. A rich man was about to eat this dish. The chef stopped him and said, this dish must be eaten with this sauce, even if it looks a bit strange. The man trusted the chef and took a bite. As soon as the taste hit his mouth, the taste was so amazing that he started eating quickly. A smile of happiness appeared on the chef's face. He was a world class chef who often cooked in luxury hotels and banquets, but now he needed an assistant to work with him. One day, his eyes fell on a girl cooking food by the roadside. The girl was cooking in a very simple way, but seeing the cleanliness of her hands, the chef was amazed. He immediately called her for an interview. On the day of the interview, the chef told all the candidates, whoever makes the best fried rice will become my assistant. Everyone started preparing. One candidate used fresh ingredients, butter and garnish, so the dish looked attractive. Meanwhile, the girl took leftover rice, added just one egg and started frying it in a very simple way. Now there were two different plates in front of the chef. He first smelled the girl's fried rice and without tasting it, said This is the flavor I am looking for. People were surprised, but the chef understood that real flavor is always hidden in simplicity.

She thought that people would think that her sister has committed suicide. After pushing her sister down, she quickly takes out her phone and starts making a video. Looking at the camera, she says, I am going to jump off this cliff myself. Whenever you find my dead body near my house, understand that it is me. After finishing the recording, she posted the video on social media. But as soon as she looked at her sister, she was shocked. She saw a leg placed on the edge of the clip. When she went closer and look, she found out that it was a fake leg. When she looked down, she saw her sister's dead body lying there. Then she remembered that her sister was handicapped. She had worked so hard to steal her identity, but now everything has gone in vain. She remembered that she had just uploaded a video. Thankfully, the network was very weak there. The upload was about to complete when she quickly put the phone in airplane mode. Then she ran downstairs and started muttering to herself, no, you are in my place. Everyone will know that you are not me. How do I handle this now? Then her eyes fell on the nearby railway track. She turned her head and saw that a train was coming. Then she looked at both her healthy legs and suddenly a new idea came To her mind, she thought if I put my sister's fake leg on the track, it will look like the train has cut it. This way no one will know that she was handicapped. She very carefully put the fake leg on the track and hid behind a nearby stone. In a few moments the train passed from there. After completing the plan, she left from there and removed the airplane mode of the phone and uploaded the video again. Now she felt that with the identity of velocity price, she alone was going to claim the wealth of billions. But he had no idea that suddenly another woman was going to enter. And with the arrival of that woman, all his plans would go to waste.

He resisted, so you smashed his face into a desk and you called him a monkey. That's a lie. But you do admit you violently subdued him? Yeah, he was trying to get away. Because you are a loose cannon that cannot control his animal instincts. Actually, the only animal in this courtroom, counselor, is your client, Doctor West. So all black men are animals to you? Oh, come on. This is such garbage. And you felt justified to take out your rage on him. So what if I did, huh? Detective? After what he did to those three boys? Detective, sit down. And all the other ones. He's lucky I didn't put him in a goddamn body bag. Detective, sit down! I move for an immediate mistrial. Your honor, this witness's illusions to other alleged victims is prejudice. The jury can be instructed to disregard that portion of his testimony. Too loud a bell to unring, Mister Stone. Motion for a mistrial is granted. What? You should know better, detective. The jury is dismissed. Thank you so much, your honor. I also move that bail be set. Your honor, the facts of this case have not changed. No, on the contrary, your honor. Detective Cassidy's outburst has tainted the people's case. Do we expect Doctor West to rot in jail while they try and pick up the pieces? I'll retry this case. Tomorrow at 9:30. We both know that's not going to happen. Bail is reduced to $50,000. Are you kidding me? Praise the Lord. Well, he gets to walk away from me after what he did. Sit down, bailiff! Order in this courtroom! No! Shame on you. Get him out of here. Shame on all of you! Clear the courtroom.

Courts have only dealt with this issue tangentially. In Roe v. Wade, the court implied that an unborn baby was alive when it could survive on its own. Could drew householder survive without being hooked up to all those machines? His doctor say that he could not. So, in effect, the life you took from Drew Householder wasn't really life to begin with, was it? All I know is that when I looked in his crib, I saw a baby who couldn't form the most basic thought of his own. He couldn't love. And when I saw the pain that. The unutterable suffering that his existence was causing the two people who loved him most, I had to do something, whether that meant going to prison or not. Does Mrs. Householder have sole custody of drew? Um, no. Uh, she, uh. She shares it with Mr. Householder. Did you confer with him before you hasten the death of his son? No. Do you feel guilty for what you've done? You feel guilty for what you're doing? I'll ask again. Do you feel guilty for what you've done? I did what I felt was right. Mr. Barber. Do you feel guilty, sir? I do. Will the defendant please rise? Have you reached a verdict? Yes, we have, your honor. On the sole count of the indictment, murder in the second Degree. We find the defendant, Rafael Baba, not guilty. Members of the jury, you are excused. The court thanks you for

S, and yet you still refused to have an abortion. Yes. Why couldn't, couldn't what? I couldn't kill my baby because that would be wrong. Yes. So it was wrong to kill drew when you were five months pregnant, but it's okay to kill him 10 months after he was born? Is that what you're saying? I don't believe that what I did was murder. But when you went into Drew Householder's hospital room, he was alive. When you came out, he was dead. Somebody did something. Yes, I killed him. Um, but what I did, I don't believe that it was a murder. I'm starting to feel like we're walking a razor's edge here, Mr Barber. It was a justifiable homicide. In other words, you had to do it. There were these, um, flowers on the Table next to Drew's crib, orange roses. He would never know how wonderful they are. He couldn't smell them. His mom was playing one of Bach cantatas from her phone, the Eternal Bach. Drew couldn't hear it. The bottom line is that he would never even know that these things existed. He didn't know if he was hungry or thirsty. He couldn't recognize the faces of his mother or his father. All that he did know, all that he would ever know was the pain that was his so called life. How do you know? The doctors say that his brain has stopped functioning. So he was dead already.

 #MLBTradeDeadline #Phillies #BaseballUpdates #SportsNews#USA","usa,phillies,sportsnews,mlbtradedeadline,baseballupdates","Santa's little helper was extremely gluttonous. His body finally couldn't take it anymore, and then he went to heaven. God gave him two paths to choose from. One LED to the fitness dog heaven, the other LED to the fat dog hell. And there was even free pizza there. Actually, the one who was truly gluttonous was Homer. He also had to take cholesterol lowering medication regularly. He needed Santa's little helper to pull him up just to stand. Just then, a TV commercial said there was a chair that could help people stand up. For only one to one hundred dollars, you could take it home. But Homer couldn't afford it, so he went online to start a fundraiser. He even recorded a video specifically for it. At this moment, Lisa came over and asked him what he was doing. He then had Lisa help him play the sympathy card. After watching Homer's video, people extended their helping hands one after another. Only the rich man didn't want to donate money to him. But he also accidentally donated a sum to him. Dang it! Soon, Homer raised enough money to buy that chair. But he also specifically posted a video to show off. My ass was just lifted by a thousand angels! We bought him a chair! After seeing it, Carl cursed Homer for being a lazy bastard. Luann also questioned Kirk about where he got the secret stash of money to donate to that idiot Homer. Homer sat In the chair, exercising with the trainer. The chair even helped him eat. At this moment, someone knocked on the door. This was the first time Homer was so willing to stand up and answer the door. Standing outside the door were all people condemning him. People rushed in and sent Maggie flying. Then they punched and kicked the chair. Finally, they burned it down with fire. Wait a minute. That's not the chair. No tip. Homer was extremely sad about losing the chair. Marge had never seen him so unhappy, even while lying in bed.

I only found out from a friend that she was pregnant. That night, I rushed to the bar where she worked. When I heard the child was mine, I said I would take responsibility. But she told me to stay away from her and the baby. She would rather face everything alone than let me ruin their lives. Rejected, I stumbled into a bar. But this time, security threw me out.

Emma had been cranky, the baby hadn't napped well, the house was a disaster because he'd been too overwhelmed to clean. Could I handle dinner and bedtime alone so he could decompress? Oliver was there watching. I smiled sweetly. Of course, honey, you've had such a hard day. Why don't you and Oliver go out for drinks? My treat. Thomas's eyes lit up. They left immediately. I called my mother, asked her to watch the kids on Saturday, told her I needed to prove something. Saturday morning, I woke Thomas at 6. I have to go into the office. Emergency project. You've got the kids all day. I'll be back by bedtime. He started protesting that Oliver was visiting. They had plans to watch football. Oliver can help you. After all, you said it's basically a vacation. I left before he could argue. But I didn't go to the office. I went to my friend Lisa's house with my laptop and our nanny cam app. Watch the disaster unfold in real time. By 7, the baby was screaming. Thomas couldn't find the formula I'd supposedly made. There were six bottles in the fridge clearly labeled. By 8, Emma had dumped her breakfast everywhere. While Thomas was changing the baby, Oliver was trying to clean it, gagging. By 9, both kids were crying, Thomas was yelling, and Oliver was stressed, eating cereal straight from the box. By 10, Thomas called me 15 times. Didn't Answer, texted once in meetings, handle it like you do every easy day. By noon, the house looked like a tornado hit. Thomas had given Emma three different snacks to keep her quiet. The baby had blown out two outfits and Oliver was hiding in the guest room. Thomas texted that the baby might be sick. I responded with the pediatrician's number. By 3, Thomas was crying on the couch while both kids destroyed the living room. Oliver was trying to build a barrier of couch cushions to contain Emma. By 5, I came home to complete chaos. Toys everywhere, food ground into carpets, both kids filthy and unfed. Since lunch, Thomas, wild eyed and defeated. Oliver packed and leaving immediately. How was your easy day, I asked. Thomas started yelling about how I set him up, abandoned him, that weekends were different. I pulled out my phone, showed him my time sheet. I work 10 hour days, come home and do exactly what you couldn't handle for nine hours every single day while you play games during nap time. Oliver heard everything before he left, told Thomas he was pathetic on his way out. Thomas now handles all child care without complaint. He also got a part time remote job during nap times. Funny how he suddenly found the time once he realized what actual work looked like.

So I gave him a full easy day alone. And by noon he was calling me crying. I've been the sole income earner for our family for four years. When our second child was born, daycare cost would have eaten my entire salary increase from my promotion. So we agreed Thomas would stay home. He'd been laid off from his marketing job anyway and my engineering salary could cover everything. I thought we were a team. I work 50 hours a week minimum, often 60 during project deadlines. Still, I handle bedtime routine, cook weekend meals, do all the grocery shopping, manage the budget, schedule doctor appointments and wake up for night feedings. With our eight month old, Thomas handles weekday childcare and light cleaning. That's the division we agree on. Last week, Thomas's brother Oliver came to visit. I was working from home in my office with the door closed on a critical client call, but I could hear them talking in the kitchen. Oliver asked how Thomas was handling being home all day with two kids. Honestly, it's easier than any job I've had. Emma is 18 months and just plays with blocks all day. The baby mostly sleeps. I get maybe three hours of actual work. The rest is just being present, playing video games while they nap, scrolling my phone while they play the Hard part is when Jennifer comes home exhausted and acts like she's the only one who worked. Oliver asked what I did to help. She thinks doing bedtime is some huge contribution, but the kids are already tired by then and she complains if there's laundry not folded or dishes in the sink like I'm her employee. She has no idea how easy her life is just sitting at a computer all day while I'm actually raising our children. I nearly dropped my laptop. This man who spent yesterday's nap time playing online poker was calling my job easy, who sent me 16 texts during my presentation asking where the baby's purple pacifier was, who called me crying last month because both kids were sick and he couldn't handle it. I stayed on my call, took notes, acted professionally, but I also opened our credit card statement. Thomas had spent $300 on gaming equipment last month, 400 on takeout. He hidden by having it delivered during lunch, a subscription to some sports streaming service I'd specifically said we couldn't afford, all while I was eating packed sandwiches at my desk to save money.

Three days later, he was in handcuffs. Grandma Violet made me promise three things before she died. First, that I'd water her roses every Sunday, even after she was gone. Second, that I'd finish my nursing degree and not give up when things got hard. Third, that I'd watch out for something. She wouldn't explain, just said, I'd know it when I saw it. She squeezed my hand so hard when she said that last part, her fingers ice cold, but her grip desperate. And I promised, even though I didn't understand, she I Tuesday morning at 6:47 with me holding one hand and the hospital nurse checking her pulse with the other. And I thought that strange final promise would just be one of those deathbed things people say when they're scared and confused. Used I was wrong. The thing grandma warned me about showed up exactly three days later wearing an expensive suit I'd never seen before and demanding half of everything she'd left behind. My stepbrother, Garrett, walked into that lawyer's office on Friday morning looking like he'd won the lottery. And by Friday afternoon, he was in the back of a police car with his hands cuffed behind his back, screaming about his rights while his mother sobbed on the sidewalk. The story of how we got from point a to point B involves forged signatures, hidden cameras, a suspicious Rolex, and the fact that my grandmother was apparently way smarter. And way more parent more than any of us realized. Garrett showed up to Grandma's funeral on Wednesday wearing a suit that probably cost $3,000, which was weird because two months ago he'd called my dad begging for money to pay his electric Bill. Dad gave him $400, like he always did. And Garrett never paid it back. So like he always did. But now he had Italian shoes and a watch that caught the light every time he moved his wrist, this gold Rolex that he kept adjusting and showing off like he wanted people to notice. I noticed. I spent the entire funeral watching him work the room at the reception, shaking hands with Grandma's friends and accepting condolences like he was the grieving grandson there every day. The reality was different. Garrett had visited grandma exactly twice during her ten month cancer battle. Once at Christmas when his mom Patricia dragged him there for the obligatory family photo, and once in February for about 15 minutes when he needed to borrow Grandma's car because his truck was repossessed. I know because I was there. Three days is a week minimum, sleeping in the chair beside her bed, helping her to the bathroom at 3 a. M, holding her hand through the bad days when the pain medication made her confused and scared. Garrett ate potato salad and told people how much he'd miss her. And I wanted to throw something at his head, Patricia.

She saw me staring and touch them almost defensively, grandma gave them to her last week as a thank you for all the help. I almost laughed. Patricia had shown up to the hospital twice, both times staying less than half an hour because the smell made her nauseated. She never helped with medications, never sat through a chemo appointment, never once offered to give me a break so I could go home and sleep my own bed. But there she was wearing my grandmother's pearls and smiling like she'd earned them. She leaned in close and said she hoped there wouldn't be any drama at the will reading tomorrow, that grandma had been very clear about wanting to be fair to everyone. The way she said fair made my stomach hurt. Dad stood across the room looking uncomfortable in his suit. And when I caught his eye, he looked away fast. That's when I knew something was wrong, really wrong, because dad only did that guilty look when he'd already chosen Patricia's side over mine and didn't want to face me. Got it. The lawyer's office Friday morning was downtown in one of those old buildings with marble floors and wood paneling that smelled like furniture polish and old money. I got there 20 minutes early and sat in the waiting area drinking Terrible coffee from a paper cup, trying not to think about the fact that this was really happening, that grandma was really gone and we were really about to divide up her things like she was just stuff to be sorted. Dad showed up 15 minutes later, his tie already loose, even though it wasn't even nine yet, and sat three chairs away from me without saying anything. Patricia and Garrett arrived exactly on time, both dressed like they were going to court. Patricia in a black pantsuit and Garrett in that expensive suit with the Rolex gleaming on his wrist. The secretary called us back at 9:30 and let us down a hallway into a conference room where a woman named Beverly Harrison sat behind a massive desk with a folder in front of her and reading glasses on a chain around her neck. She was probably 70 with perfect white hair and the kind of face that had seen too many families fight over money to be surprised by anything. She shook all our hands and said she was very sorry for our loss, that Violet had been a wonderful woman and a valued client for over 30 years. Then she opened the folder and the room got very quiet very fast. Full story is linked below or on my channel.

My daughter stopped coming home because she said I made her compete for my attention with a dead woman. It started when she made varsity swim team as a sophomore. Only three underclassmen made it that year. She came home waving the acceptance letter. Dad, I made varsity. I was standing in the hallway, the one covered floor to ceiling with photos of my late wife, wedding pictures, her high school swim trophies, beach vacations. I'd spent two weekends building it. After the funeral, I looked at a photo of my wife teaching our daughter to swim when she was 3. Your mom would have been so proud. She taught you in that exact pool. Remember? My daughter's smile faded. Yeah, dad. I remember. She went to her room. I heard the door closed. That became every single conversation. When she made honor roll, I showed her my wife's valedictorian plaque. When she won regionals, I pulled out a box of my wife's medals and spread them on the kitchen table. Look, look at these. This is what real dedication looks like. She just stared at them. When she asked me to come to parent teacher night, I said I couldn't. It was the anniversary of my wife's death. I needed to go to the cemetery. But, dad, it's only once a year and it's my junior year. It matters. Your mom matters, too. I went to the grave. Instead, sat there three hours talking to a headstone. My daughter ate microwave Mac and cheese alone. I thought I was keeping my wife's memory alive. I thought I was being a good husband. I didn't notice my daughter stopped showing me her report cards, stop telling me about swim practice, start, started eating every meal in her room. Then came her 18th birthday. I took her to this Italian place downtown, her favorite. She'd been asking to go for two months. We sat down. She ordered chicken Parmesan. I started talking before the waiter even left. Mom and I came here for our first anniversary. She ordered the same thing, same table. Actually, my daughter put her menu down. Dad, do you even know what place I got at regionals? I opened my mouth. Nothing came out. Third place, she said. Her voice was quiet. Out of 47 swimmers, I texted you the results. I called you four times. I left a note on the counter right next to your coffee mug. You were at the cemetery talking to someone who can't answer you instead of watching me.

I was flipping burgers at my summer barbecue when Missus Kowalski's cat literally threw itself through her closed kitchen window, not near the window, through the window. Glass exploded everywhere and this orange tabby landed in her flower bed screeching like it had seen the devil himself. 20 of us just froze mid conversation and stared because cats don't just kamikaze through windows for no reason. Then we heard a man inside Mrs. Kowalski's house scream, what the hell? Followed by the loudest crash I've ever heard. That wasn't a car accident. Mrs. Kowalski, who was standing right next to me holding a plate of potato salad, popped the entire thing on the ground and whispered, I live alone. That's when my roommate, Gavin, who was already six beers deep and shirtless for some reason, grabbed the metal barbecue spatula, held it up like a sword and yelled, who wants to be a hero? Before sprinting full speed toward her back door. Four other drunk guys immediately chased after him, screaming various battle cries. And I just stood there thinking this was either the dumbest or greatest thing I'd ever witnessed. But here's where it gets weird. As Gavin reached Missus Kowalski's back door, it flew open from the inside and a guy in all black came running out carrying a pillowcase full of stuff. He was wearing a ski mask in the middle. Of July and didn't see Gavin until the last possible second. Collided at full speed and the burglar's pillowcase exploded on impact, sending jewellery and electronics flying through the air in slow motion. A laptop hit the fence, rings scattered across the grass and Gavin, who'd somehow held onto his spatula during the collision, just laid there on top of the burglar yelling, I've captured him. I've actually captured him. The burglar tried to scramble away, but Derek tackled him from the side with a pool noodle, which shouldn't have worked, but absolutely did because the burglar slipped on Missus Kowalski's wet grass and went down hard. My cousin Felix, who'd grabbed a bag of charcoal for reasons nobody understood, stumped the entire thing on the guy's head. The burglar was now covered in black dust, coughing and blind. And that's when Julian appeared out of nowhere holding a massive watermelon above his head like the boulder from Indiana Jones. Time actually seemed to slow down as Julian wound up his throat. Everyone watching started yelling different things. Don't do it. Do it. That's evidence. Throw it. The burglar looked up through his charcoal covered ski mask just in time to see 20 pounds of watermelon flying directly at his face. The impact sounded like a cartoon sound effect. The watermelon exploded. The burglar went down and Julian just stood there with his arms raised in victory yelling, watermelon justice. The burglar wasn't knocked out, just absolutely covered in fruit. Chunks and charcoal dust.

Her lawyer was aggressive, smug. My lawyer was a shark. At the first mediation, Jennifer sat across from me, arms crossed. My attorney, Davis, slid a folder across the table. Let's discuss assets. Jennifer's lawyer opened it. His face went gray. Inside were property deeds, stock portfolios, trust documents, bank statements showing years of rental income, investment gains, and compounding growth. Jennifer's eyes widened. What is this? These are my clients assets, Davis said calmly. Acquired before the marriage through inheritance, held in a separate trust, not marital property. Jennifer grabbed the papers, hands shaking. You've had millions this whole time. Her voice cracked. While I worked, while I sacrificed, while I went without, you were secretly rich. I met her eyes while you called me weak, while you humiliated me in front of our son, while you told everyone I was worthless. I was watching. Watching to see if you'd love me when you thought I had nothing. Her face twisted. This is manipulation. No, I said quietly. This is clarity. You showed me exactly who you are. Her lawyer leaned in. We can contest the trust. Davis smiled. You can try. It's iron clad. Separate property, premarital, untouchable. The mediation ended with Jennifer getting nothing. No house, no. No spousal support. Just child support calculated on my manager salary. And I got full custody after Tyler testified he wanted to live with me. That night, Tyler asked, dad, why didn't you tell her? Because I needed to know the truth, I said. And now I do. Jennifer tried calling for weeks, apologizing, begging, claiming she'd been stressed, that she didn't mean it. But I'd heard her laugh on that phone call. Heard her call me dead weight. Six months later, Tyler and I moved into a bigger house. When I paid for in cash. Jennifer posted on social media about betrayal, about deception. Her friends rallied. Some of mine questioned me. I didn't defend myself. I just kept living, kept being the father Tyler deserved. And every time someone asked if I regretted not telling her, I think back to that dinner. Your father is weak. That's why we have nothing. I'd smile and say, no regrets. I found out exactly what I needed to know.

That's why we have nothing. I stayed quiet, but when she filed for divorce, what the lawyer revealed made her collapse. Your father is weak. That's why we have nothing. My wife, Jennifer said it at dinner. Our 12 year old son, Tyler looked at me, waiting. I just cut my chicken and stayed silent. Jennifer had been saying things like this for months. Little digs, casual cruelty. Always in front of Tyler. Always designed to shrink me. I worked as a quality control manager. Decent salary, stable hours, good benefits. But Jennifer wanted more. She wanted the executive husband, the luxury cars, the Instagram lifestyle. What she got was me. A man who worked hard, came home tired, and believed in saving money instead of spending it. Her resentment grew like mold. It started small comments about my clothes, about how her friend's husbands took them on cruises, about how I had no ambition. Then it became pointed, especially in front of Tyler. Your dad doesn't have what it takes. Your dad settled for mediocre. Your dad is too scared to ask for a raise. I never fought back. Not because I was weak, but because I was protecting something she didn't know about. Six years earlier, my father passed away. He left me everything. A paid off rental property portfolio. Eight units across three states. Stocks, bonds, a safety deposit box with gold. And one instruction. Don't tell anyone. Until you're certain they love you for you, not for what you have. I never told Jennifer. When we married, I was 26, working entry level, driving a used Honda. She said she loved me for my kindness, for my stability. I wanted to believe her, so I kept the inheritance hidden, set up a separate trust, hired a property manager. Every month, rental income poured in. I reinvested it. The portfolio grew. By the time Jennifer called me weak at dinner, I was worth $2.3 million. But I still drove the Honda, still brought lunch from home, still lived like a quality control manager. Because I needed to know, would she love me if she thought I had nothing? The answer came three months later. Tyler ran into my home office, tears streaming down his face. Mom's talking to someone. She said she's done with you. She said you're dead weight. I found her in the bedroom, on the phone, laughing. No, he won't fight it. He's too passive. I'll get the house, child support, and I'm finally free to find someone worth my time. She didn't see me in the doorway. The divorce papers arrived one week later. Jennifer wanted the house, full custody, $4,000 monthly in spousal

Gavin stood over him with the spatula pointed at his chest and said, completely seriously, you've been grilled, criminal. Missus Kowalski walked over, looked down at this disaster of a human being on her lawn and started laughing so hard she had to sit down on the grass. She was crying, laughing, couldn't breathe, just pointing at him and wheezing. The burglar tried to say something, but his mouth was full of watermelon, so it came out as mmm, mmm, legal mmm. Someone yelled that we should call the police, and I pulled out my phone. But before I could even unlock it, my girlfriend, Natasha, came running out of my house holding the biggest roll of plastic wrap I'd ever seen, the industrial kind we bought for covering food at the party. She had this absolutely manic look in her eyes and yelled, cure the suspect, like she was in a cop show. Before anyone could process what was happening, she started wrapping the burglar's legs together while he was still lying there covered in charcoal and fruit. She wrapped around and around and around, and the burglar was too shocked and winded to even fight back. He just kept saying, wait, what? What is this? What's happening? In this confused, defeated voice, Derek immediately understood the assignment and started wrapping the guy's arms to his torso. Then Felix found another roll of plastic wrap in my kitchen and They just kept going. Within three minutes, this burglar looked like a human burrito, just his head sticking out, completely immobilized, covered in black dust and watermelon chunks, lying on Mrs. Kowalski's lawn while 20 drunk people stood around watching like this was normal. But then it got weirder because Gavin suggested we take him to the front yard to wait for police. And six guys just picked him up like a log and carried him. The burglar was screaming the whole way, yelling about his rights and lawyers and illegal detention. But Gavin just kept spatula tapping his head saying, shh, you're under citizens arrest. Very legal, very cool. They propped him up against my fence like a decoration. And that's when things got out of control. Full story is linked below or on my channel.

Dad states. I'm competing at the state championship in two weeks. I'm one of only six sophomores in the entire region who qualified. And you have no idea because you're so obsessed with keeping mom alive that you forgot I'm still here. The waiter brought our food. Neither of us touched it. Do you know what it's like? She said, her voice cracked. Growing up knowing you'll never be as good as the dead version of your mom. That nothing you do will ever matter as much as what she. I tried to interrupt. She held up her hand. I'm just this constant reminder of what you lost. I see it every time you look at me. You don't see me, dad. You see her. And I'm not her. I'll never be her. She took a breath. I'm moving in with Aunt Rachel. I got early admission to UC Berkeley. Full ride. I leave in two months, and honestly, I can't wait to be somewhere where I'm not competing with a ghost. But, honey, we can fix this. She stood up, grabbed her purse. No, dad, we can't. Because even right now, you're probably thinking about what mom would say. You're not thinking about me. You never do. She walked out. I sat there. The waiter came over. Is everything okay, sir? I told him to box it up. I drove home in complete silence, walked past the photo wall, and that's when it hit me. I couldn't Remember the last time I asked about her day? The last time I went to a swim meet? The last time I told her I was proud without mentioning her mom? Three years. Three years I spent building a shrine. And I completely missed my daughter growing up. She moved out six days later. Packed everything while I was at work. Left her key on the kitchen counter. Aunt Rachel came with a truck. I tried to talk to her. She said I had two years to talk, and I chose the cemetery instead. That was nine months ago. She's at Berkeley now. We've texted three times. I tried apologizing, tried explaining. The messages just say read. No response. My house is silent. The photo wall is still perfect, every frame straight. But when I look at it now, I don't see my wife. I see three years of soccer games. I missed science fairs. I skipped swim meets. I didn't attend birthday dinners where I talked about a dead woman instead of the living daughter sitting across from me. Last week, I got a notification. She blocked me on social media. I lost my wife to cancer. I lost my daughter to grief. And I have nobody to blame but myself.

My daughter stopped coming home because she said I made her compete for my attention with a dead woman. It started when she made varsity swim team as a sophomore. Only three underclassmen made it that year. She came home waving the acceptance letter. Dad, I made varsity. I was standing in the hallway, the one covered floor to ceiling with photos of my late wife, wedding pictures or high school swim trophies. Each vacations, I'd spent two weekends building it. After the funeral, I looked at a photo of my wife teaching our daughter to swim when she was 3. Your mom would have been so proud. She taught you in that exact. Remember? My daughter's smile faded. Yeah, dad, I remember. She went to her room. I heard the door closed. That became every single conversation. When she made honor roll, I showed her my wife's valedictorian plaque. When she won regionals, I pulled out a box of my wife's medals and spread them on the kitchen table. Look at these. This is what real dedication looks like. She just stared at them. When she asked me to come to parent teacher night, I said I couldn't. It was the anniversary of my wife's death. I needed to go to this cemetery. But, dad, it's only once a year and it's my junior year. It matters. Your mom matters, too. I went to the grave instead sat There three hours talking to a headstone. My daughter ate microwave Mac and cheese alone. I thought I was keeping my wife's memory alive. I thought I was being a good husband. I didn't notice my daughter stopped showing me her report cards, stop telling me about swim practice, started eating every meal in her room. Then came her 18th birthday. I took her to this Italian place downtown, her favorite. She'd been asking to go for two months. We sat down. She ordered chicken Parmesan. I started talking before the waiter even left. Your mom and I came here for our first anniversary. She ordered the same thing, same table. Actually, my daughter put her menu down. Dad, do you even know what place I got at regionals. I opened my mouth, nothing came out. Third place, she said. Her voice was quiet. Out of 47 swimmers, I texted you the results. I called you four times. I left a note on the counter right next to your coffee mug. You were at the cemetery talking to someone who can't answer you instead of watching me swim. I tried to say something, but she kept going.

John Paul, I just went on base what she was worth back home. I put her at $800, and I hope I'm right. Actual retail value was 1,050. Cole, you were right on the money. Good job. I work for one of the biggest order buyers in the country. I mean, I'm not saying you need me to figure your taxes, but I also kind of know where the.

The hammer couldn't break open the iron door. The man carefully examined the oxygen cylinders in the cabinet. He used a wrench to open the valve at the bottom of the oxygen cylinder and tried to turn on the switch. To his surprise, there was still plenty of oxygen in the cylinder. This gave him hope. He immediately grabbed other parts and began assembling them. Before long, a complete set of oxyacetylene welding tools was assembled. Looking at the flames spurting from the welding torch, he thought he would definitely be able to open the door. But after the man used the oxyacetylene torch for a long time, the sturdy iron door only had its surface blackened. The steel inside hadn't melted at all. He took off his protective goggles and angrily grabbed the hammer. Charging at the cabinet, he smashed and kicked it to vent his emotions. After venting, the man slumped down by the door, falling into deep despair. He had been trapped here for three days now. His friend had never shown up. He could only wait here to die. Just then, he suddenly discovered a small hole in the smooth wall. Hope instantly ignited. He took off his shirt and hurriedly grabbed the hammer and chisel, making one last struggle. Unexpectedly, the seemingly thick concrete wall was much softer than he had imagined. In no time, the Small hole was smashed into a large hole. The man's heart was filled with wild joy. The speed of chiseling the wall became faster and faster. It looked like he would soon chisel through the wall and escape through the hole. At this moment, the rotten, stinking, dead rat in the room finally came in handy. The man picked up maggots from the rat's body, holding them in his hand like peanuts, then slap them into his mouth in one go. This provided precious energy for his body. After filling his stomach, he had more strength to chisel the wall. Soon he chiseled through the concrete and the rebar inside was exposed. Fortunately, these rebars were very thin and weren't really a problem. The man lit the oxygen acetylene torch and before long he had burned through all the rebars. Over the next two days, he endured hunger, sleeping when tired, and chiseling the wall when awake. With perseverance beyond ordinary imagination, he finally succeeded in chiseling through the wall. Looking at the light coming through the hole in the wall, the man was too excited to speak. He swung the hammer as fast as he could to make the hole bigger, then crawled out on all fours with wild joy. But the moment the man crawled out of the hole, the despair swallowed him again. Outside was another sealed room.

Get upstairs now! Lipp had been having strange dreams lately. He knew he couldn't keep going like that. After all, he was only in his 20s, still full of energy. So he went to a diner and approached a waitress. He told her what he was thinking. But then Sarah came over. The girl took one look at Sarah and then rejected Lipp. And I would love to jump your bones, cause Sierra's my girl. But we're friends. It'd still be weird. After being rejected, Lipp went to his job at the garage. He shared his dreams with a coworker. In this dream, my entire house is filled with all these naked models, right? But every time I go and try to touch some tits, poof! Now she disappears. But their talk got way too explicit, and it really ticked Eddie off. You're gonna fix that bike or fuck it. Jesus Christ, already? That night, Lipp managed to score a date with a girl. At first, things went great. Then the girl suggested having a few drinks. But Lipp wasn't having it. He was trying to stay sober. While she went to order the drinks, he slipped out and left. The next day, Brad came to Lipp with some happy news. He was going to be a dad. But Lipp started rambling about what happened the night before. And Eddie couldn't take it anymore. He's been yapping about ass non stop. You know, I'm almost 10 months clean. He's gonna make me backslide. When the two of them started arguing, Brad quickly bailed. I need some fucking pussy. Get upstairs now! Hearing Eddie's words, lick was stunned. After

Well, one of the first people to testify against him was his ex partner, Officer Dawson Farley, who was with him that day. He said there wasn't one point that night that he was afraid of Sonya Massey, and in fact, the only person he was afraid of that night was his partner, Sean Grayson. When they played the body cam footage for the jury to see, Sean Grayson covered his ears and looked down when they played the part where he fired three times at Sonya, taking her life. If you're unfamiliar with this case, on July 6th of 2024, Sonya Massey called police to her home in Springfield, Illinois because she thought that there was an intruder outside of her house. After entering, Sean Grayson notices there's a pot of boiling water on the stove, so he tells Sonya to go take it off. And as she's taking it off, they're joking back and forth, and Sonya says, I'll rebuke you in the name of Jesus. That's when Sean Grayson says, you better effing not! I swear to god, I'll shoot you in your effing face! Sonya apologizes and ducks beneath the counter, but regardless, Grayson fires three times, hitting her once in the head. He then prevents his partner from getting medical aid because he says she's already done. Turns out Sean Grayson had a history of misconduct, but he was still allowed to be on the field. Rest in peace to Sonya. Prayers for her justice. Let me know what you guys think, and as anything comes out, I'll keep you guys updated.

Around 9:30 yesterday morning, police responded to a call from a young boy who said that everyone in his home was dead. Officers described it as nothing short of a massacre, with Jonathan shooting Lindsay, Ethan, Dylan and Lucas, but leaving his ten year old unharmed. Now, according to police, sometime overnight, Jonathan and Lindsay became involved in an altercation. Jonathan then, quote, armed himself with a gun, and he shot her several times. At that point, he reportedly started going through the house and systematically killing their children. There was actually just one child found in his bed, with investigators saying that they were hunted down and killed. Now, aside from that, we know investigators didn't find any signs of a struggle and that ultimately they found two bodies upstairs and two bodies downstairs. They say that why the young, the question wasn't killed remains a mystery, and that he was released to other family members at the scene. There were also no previous calls to the residents or reports of domestic violence. And it seems like everyone is wondering what happened. Lindsay Candy was known to be a wonderful mother, and 18 year old Dylan just graduated from the local high school last year. Ethan was a 9th grader there, and Lucas was a 6th grader at the intermediate school. And anyone with information that could help this Investigation is asked to contact the homicide tip line at the number above.

Seeing that something was wrong, the man quickly LED the boy aside. A strange odor lingered in the air. They asked will if he had been drinking or eating anything suspicious, like undercooked chicken. My lasagna. Wow. The woman turned to the boys behind her and asked if they knew what will had eaten or inhaled. But they all shook their heads, saying, no. Have you been drinking? You just asked him that. The man suggested it might be appendicitis. The woman said she would press on Will's appendix and told him that if it had burst, he would feel pain. But will showed no sign of pain. At that moment, the man noticed that Will's friends looked extremely nervous. He stepped forward and asked what had really happened, but the boys still insisted that nothing was wrong. The man said sternly that will was seriously ill, and if they knew anything, they had to speak up right now. What do you want me to say? I don't know anything. Wow. Wow, wow, wow, wow. No, don't. Okay, what the hell is going on? What did you guys take

I was 14 when I discovered I was deathly allergic to shellfish. We were at a family barbecue when someone brought shrimp skewers. Three bites in, my throat started closing. My lips swelled. Hives erupted across my arms. My cousin noticed first. Your neck, she said. Look at your neck. Red welts were crawling up from my collar. When I tried to call for help, my voice came out as a raspy whisper. My aunt found me collapsed against the sink. She screamed for my parents. Mom took one look and said, hospital now. We piled into the car, me in the backseat trying to remember how to breathe. Each inhale felt like sucking air through a coffee stirrer. We were maybe two miles from the hospital when my 11 year old sister piped up, can we stop at Starbucks? There's one right here. My vision was blurring and she wanted a Frappuccino. Not now, sweetie, mom said. But her voice was gentle. Negotiable, please, my sister whined. We're literally passing it. I tried to object but could only wheeze. Dad glanced at me in the rearview mirror. We have time, he said. She's still conscious. Still conscious. Those were the words he used to justify pulling into the Starbucks drive through while I was dying in the backseat. The line had six cars. Two minutes became four. Four became seven. My sister Ordered a venti caramel ribbon crunch with extra whipped cream. Mom reminded her to say please. Meanwhile, I was clawing at my throat, trying to force air into lungs that were sealing shut. The woman at the window noticed me. Is she okay? Just car sick, dad lied smoothly. When we finally pulled away, I'd lost feeling in my fingertips. The world was going gray. My sister took a long sip. Thanks, daddy, she said. Nine more minutes to the hospital. I spent them convinced I was going to die listening to her slurp her Starbucks. We screeched into the er bay. Within seconds, nurses surrounded us. I heard someone yell for an Epipen. The epinephrine hit my system like a defibrillator. A doctor leaned over me. You got here just in time, she said. Another few minutes and we'd be having a very different conversation. Just in time. We would have been there 10 minutes earlier if not for the Starbucks stop. But everyone was so relieved I was alive that no one wanted to talk about it. Later, my parents sat beside my hospital bed. We're so glad you're okay, mom said. We were terrified. My sister stood in the corner, still clutching her cup. She wouldn't make eye contact. The next day, they retold the story to relatives. We rushed her to the hospital, dad said. Didn't waste a single second. That was eight years ago. I'm 22 now and I carry two Epipens everywhere. I've had Three more severe allergic reaction since then, each time I drove myself to the hospital.

But my daughter did something that made him turn pale. It was Thanksgiving at his parents house and I should have known better than to show up with store bought dinner rolls. For eight years of marriage to Derek, I had Learned that everything had to be perfect in front of his family or there would be consequences later. But I had been pulling 12 hour shifts at the hospital all week and barely had time to shower, let alone bake homemade bread. His mother, Patricia, made the first comment. As I set the plastic container on her perfectly set dining table, she lifted one roll with her manicured fingers like it might contaminate her entire meal. Well, she said loud enough for the entire room to hear. I suppose not everyone has time for family traditions anymore. 22 family members were crammed into that dining room. His parents, both brothers with their wives, six kids ranging from toddlers to teenagers, and various aunts and uncle who had driven in from neighboring towns. All of them turned to stare at me like I had committed some unforgivable sin. I forced a smile and explained that I had been working overtime at the hospital. Three nurses had called in sick with the flu and someone had to cover the emergency department. I thought they would understand. His father was a retired police officer. His Brothers worked construction. They knew about demanding jobs. But Derek's face was already turning that familiar shade of red that meant trouble was coming. His jaw clenched the way it always did when he thought I had embarrassed him. The vein in his temple started throbbing. You always have an excuse, he said, loudly enough to cut through every conversation in the room. The football game on TV suddenly seemed too loud. Someone's fork clinked against their plate. One of the toddlers asked for more juice, but nobody moved to help him. All eyes were on us now. I'm not making excuses, I said as calmly as I could manage. I'm explaining why I didn't have time to bake this week. That's when he hit me. The slap echoed through the dining room like a gunshot. My cheek exploded in pain, and I could taste blood where my teeth had cut the inside of my lip. The force of it knocked me sideways, and I had to grab the back of a chair to keep from falling. Complete silence fell over the room. Not one person moved. Not one person spoke. His father stared at his plate like it held the secrets of the universe. His mother suddenly developed an intense interest in folding and refolding her napkin. His brothers exchanged a quick glance, but immediately looked away. Even the children had gone completely quiet. Don't you ever embarrass me like that again, Derek hissed through clenched teeth. That's when My 16 year old daughter Chloe stood up from the kids table in the corner. She had been living with us for two years since her father died in a motorcycle accident. Derek had never liked her, always complained that she was too mouthy, too independent, too much like me for his taste. She walked over slowly, deliberately, pulling her phone out of her back pocket as she moved. When she reached where Derek was standing, she held it up and aimed it directly at his face. Smile, she said with this.

Allison, what did you put in these cookies? Long silence, only the sound of rain. Finally, she looked up, eyes red and swollen. Laxatives, she whispered. Strong laxatives, just enough that Kira would get sick before her swimming competition. She broke down crying. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What was I thinking? I placed my hand on her shoulder. I should have been furious, but I felt sadness more than anger. Why? Alison looked at me with tear filled eyes. Mom praises Kira constantly and tears Quinn down. Just like when we were kids. You were always praised. I was always criticized. Her voice grew stronger. Every Celebration of Kira's success highlights Quinn's failures. Just once I wanted her to experience setback, too. I was speechless. I never realized Alison's pain had grown this deep. Why did you call? I asked. So I regretted it from the moment I sent them. I couldn't believe what I'd done. I was going to warn you. She started crying again. But when you said Quinn ate them, I panicked. What kind of terrible mother am I? I took her hand. It was cold and shaking. Allison, how is Quinn really? He's suffering, she said. At school they call him the failure. Teachers say your cousin is so excellent. At home, mom says, why can't you be like Kira? My chest tightened. I never wanted to acknowledge how Kira's success Affected Quinn. I'm partly responsible, I admitted. I've ignored this for years. We sat in silence, two sisters facing a truth we buried for decades. I stood up and took the container, walked to the trash and threw the cookies away. How can you forgive what I tried to do, Alison asked. Forgiveness may not come immediately, I said, but I can try to understand. I pulled out my phone. We need to have a serious talk with mom about how her comparisons affect the children. Allison looked anxious. Do you think she'll listen? I don't know. But change won't happen without trying. Six months later, Quinn found his talent in photography. Sometimes it takes something bitter to reveal what's been poisoning you all along.

Three days later she called and asked did she eat the cookies? I laughed and said your kid came over and ate them all. The next thing I heard was her screaming through the phone. The package arrived on my daughter Kira's 12th birthday from my sister Alison, a basket of homemade chocolate chip cookies with a card, happy birthday, eat as many as you like. Allison hadn't come to the party, said she had to work. I opened the basket in the kitchen. The cookies looked odd, unevenly baked, strange color. When I brought one to my nose, there was a faint, unpleasant smell. My mother was standing behind me. Is that from Allison? I guess she couldn't afford a store bought cake. Something felt wrong. Kira had a swimming competition next week. I couldn't risk her getting sick. I place the basket on a high shelf and forgot about it. Three days later, my phone rang. Allison, Maggie, I have a question. Her voice sounded strange, almost cheerful. What is it? Did anyone eat the cookies? I glanced at the kitchen shelf. The basket was still there, untouched. Oh, your cookies. I kept my tone casual. Actually, your son Quinn came by earlier and ate them all. Silence on the other end. Then Allison screamed, Quinn, when? When? What has he done? Pure panic. This afternoon I lied smoothly. He stopped by after school, said he was hungry. I gave Him, the cookies. How many? How many did he eat? Her voice was trembling. All of them. Why is there a problem? I heard something drop on her end. Her breathing was irregular. Allison, are you okay? No, it's nothing. I just, I need to talk to Quinn. She was clearly agitated. Really? I pressed because he did seem a bit strange. After he finished, he said his stomach felt weird. Alison screamed again. Oh, my god, I'm coming over right now. The call ended. I stared at my phone. My suspicions had just been confirmed. There was something in those cookies, something meant for Kira. 20 minutes later, Allison burst through my door, face pale, eyes wide with fear. Quinn, where is he? Is he alright? We need to get him to the hospital. Calm down, Allison. I kept my voice gentle. Quinn. Quinn isn't here. She froze, stared at me, confused. What do you mean? You just said I lied, I said quietly. Quinn didn't come here. No one ate your cookies. I LED her to the kitchen and showed her the container. All six cookies untouched. Not a single one has been eaten.
