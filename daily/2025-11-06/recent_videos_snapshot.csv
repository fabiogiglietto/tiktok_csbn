I don't mean any disrespect, DOC. It's just that I make my living honouring the vote. Please don't send me back to the waiting room. My stomach is killing me. Donald Trump. It's definitely food poisoning. And they made me eat a ton of discount sushi last night. Ouch. Easy, man. You're warm and your belly is obviously tender. I'd like to get a CT scan to rule out anything serious. I'll be back to check on you soon. Wait, DOC, they're voting? Okay, good. Yes, it's a yes to that scan. Hey, your scans came back. Turns out you didn't have food poisoning. You have appendicitis. I told you guys this pain was real. Ah, luckily we caught it in time. Ah, we can get you up to an operating room to remove it before it bursts. At Moo Butter's asking, is there an alternative to surgery? In some cases it can be managed with antibiotics, but surgery is the standard. Babe, the chat is all worked up over the pros and cons of surgery. Give me the camera. Alright team, this is a big one, so don't do me dirty cause my side is literally killing me. Will you let me have surgery? This is no way to determine treatment. You heard him peeps. I'm setting up a vote. Surgery versus antibiotics. Go! This is ridiculous. Votes are tallying. Okay, the votes are in. Oh, Babe, uh, surgery is a no go. Ah, ah. It's a serious medical decision and you can't let strangers on the internet make it for you. If your appendix ruptures, that's a good chance you'll die. I'm sorry. The decision's been made. We're going with the antibiotics. Doctor Choi showed me your website. It's pretty, pretty interesting stuff. His name tag legit says chief of psychiatry. I'm gonna get thrown in the Looney bin if y'all keep punking you with these votes. Dude, we're getting mad love in the tip jar today. Definitely gonna top naked skydiving. So Doctor Choi and I just wanna make sure you understand that by opting out of the surgery, that you are putting your life in danger. We never go against the vote. Those are the rules. No chance of even a one time exception? No can do. A year ago, we were living in our car. Now we've got a condo on the lake and our followers buy our merchandise and watch our ads for one simple reason. I always obey the vote. As soon as I break that pact, it's over. Okay, well, really nice to meet you both. So he clearly understands the decision he's making. Yeah, but he's not making the decision. True, but he's willingly allowing other people to do that for him. He's denying surgery to boost his online following. How can we say he doesn't pose a risk to us? Just cause he's reckless doesn't mean he's Suicidal, you know? So that's it, hmm? If the antibiotics don't take, we just watch him die? Ethan, I don't like it either, but we can't lock a patient up just cause he wants to be internet famous.

At first, things were fine. The challenge even seemed to bring them closer. But as the days dragged on, they realized it wasn't nearly as easy as they had thought. Every night the lights would shut off automatically, forcing them to rest. Every morning, they were woken up right on time. The food never changed, simple, bland and repetitive. Still, for the prize they endured. Lisa tried meditation to pass the endless hours, while Matt kept himself going with exercise. When boredom became unbearable, they played silly little games. Time moved painfully slow. By the 20th day, both of them were already drained, staring blankly at the ticking clock. Then one day, a cockroach appeared in the room. Oddly enough, Matt was delighted, desperate for something new. He even began feeding it from.

To prove their love, Stan hired workers to rebuild, but the couple ended up in a heated argument. Over the decor.

I whacked him with my purse. He threw me down. What aren't you telling me? Nothing. I'm sure it's a misunderstanding. Mom, tell your son he's out of time. Out of time for what? I don't know. That's all he said. Which son? I don't know. It has to be a misunderstanding. Your brothers are all such good boys. My brothers used to stuff me in a pillowcase and drag me around the neighborhood and look how tough it made you. They did you a favor. Tell your son he's out of time. Any idea what that means? No. No. If I did, I would tell you. Ask him about his record. I was getting to that. So you got a couple of arrests for public intoxication and multiple Duis. Ancient history. I've been sober for one year and 47 days today. Guilt by association. Really? Detective? Sorry. My mission is to help people get out of a gang life. What if one of the gangs got tired of you interfering and decided to send a message by attacking my mother? No. Which brother do you think I should be focused on? Cruz, clearly. Uh, sorry. I just need to respond to this. As I was saying, I get it. Your line of work, there is a lot of money at stake, might drive a person to violence. The guys I work with are not gonna Beat up someone's mom right chair. What happened to your car? I gave it to Benny. What do you mean you gave it to Benny? He said he needed it. I didn't ask. You've reached Benjamin Lopez. Leave a message. Hey, how's Tim? Still in surgery. Is Benny still at the station? No, he went to work. Why? He lied. He's having money problems. I try to call him, but he's not answering. We ran his credit report. We didn't see any outstanding loans. An enforcer going after family that's off the books that he's into a loan shark. We need to find him so I can kill him before somebody else does. Am I under arrest? Depends. You got a permit? Yeah. Back at the house. What are you doing here, Benny? You're asking us, cop. Where's my sister? I'm asking as a sister. I'm listening as a cop. I bought some stocks on a margin. Stocks went south. Margin got called. I didn't have it. How much? 500 grand? Hmm. I sold everything I can get my hands on. I was still 100 short. So you went to a loan shark? I know I screwed up. I can fix it. No, you're gonna let us handle it. What is this loan shark's name and where can we find him? Anyone ever tell you not to lend to a guy whose sister is a cop? Detectives. I haven't done anything illegal, just a legitimate loan to a guy who's Gone on his luck. Well, your legitimate collection agent landed my mom in the hospital.

They even carried it to a crowded area just to show it off, not realizing it had the power to wipe out an entire city. One villager suggested they sell the strange device for food. So a few clueless villagers loaded it up and started toward the city. Worried the bomb might overheat, they stopped along the way to water it, unknowingly speeding up its fuse. Hours later, they finally arrived at the city square. When the mayor saw the massive bomb, his face went pale with fear. To prove it was harmless, the villagers started hitting it again with their sticks. That was the last straw. The mayor panicked and ordered them to move it far away immediately. Grumbling but obedient, the villagers hauled it to the seaside. In front of the whole crowd, the two men tossed the bomb straight into the ocean. The mayor finally let out a sigh of relief, but the villagers were furious. They could have traded that thing for 100 tons of food. Now it was gone forever, or so they thought. Just as they turned to leave, a massive explosion erupted from the sea. The shockwave left everyone frozen in disbelief. Then as the smoke cleared, they saw the ocean filled with fish, hundreds of tons of them. By pure luck, the blast had brought in a feast so big the villagers would never Go hungry again.

And as I grew, the shortage of spectators was growing. Years later, you were old enough for kindergarten. And as soon as he entered the classroom, noticed that all the shoelaces of the other children were tied together. Even the teacher did not know how to tie his shoelaces, but he could easily untie them. On its fifth birthday, his parents gave him a new pair of leather shoes and to everyone's surprise, tied the laces with his eyes closed. His friends were, and since then, children in kindergarten, they lined up every day to have him tie the chords. His parents took him to a boxing match where the rule was that the first person to embrace his opponent would lose, which confused him. His opponent was a child who weighed more than 200 pounds. And when the bell rang, rushed forward and knocked down his opponent. The referee was stunned and the paramedics brought a Camilla, but they did not take the opponent, but they took him to the hospital for a complete check up. It was discovered that it had a chromosome less than a normal person. Grandmothers and parents searched everywhere, but they could never find the lost Chromosome. To treat it, doctors even used collapse therapy. Fortunately, not so many knots. Years later, the child had become a man and people built a public restroom just for him. Every time he came out of the bathroom, people clapped and hurried to take a picture with him. His parking place was even different from the others. When he tried to find a partner, people rejected him because of his abnormality, which made the boy very sad. To become normal, went to the hospital for surgery. Just then, he noticed a pair of feet with laces tied together was a girl who was also abnormal like him. The girl noticed his look and turned to look at him and the two stood still.

Inside the room, three zombie workers were working day and night. The first two were full of energy, but the last one was exhausted. The man threw a piece of beef at it, but the zombie was too tired to eat. The cold hearted boss pulled out a gun and ended it right there. He opened the safety door and randomly picked another zombie to replace it. When bored, he would invite a few zombies to practice boxing to relieve stress. Next, the man went hunting, throwing some pork to lure zombies away. He got in his zombie powered car and set off, but it didn't take long for the car to stop. Worried about danger, he got out to check, only to find the zombie generator had shut down. Even zombies couldn't handle this kind of work.

One zombie immediately Applied, but fell into a trap. Another zombie came for an interview, but the man told it to come back tomorrow. Once the new employee joined, the car sped up. On the way home, they ran into soldiers who were capturing people for experiments. The man switched to high speed mode and the car zoomed off, starting a chase.

Some days he forgets to put him in there. Just big floppy holes. If you're really scared, you don't have to do it. But all the other girls in my new class have their ears pierced. Well, what if I go first and show you? It's not a big deal. You do that for me. Of course. I owe you. You stop me from trying to pet that angry dog, coyote, whatever his name was. He was mean.

Say her name again. April. That's not how you said it. You said April. No, no, no. I don't think I did. You don't like her. No, no, no. That's not true. I love everybody. You don't like her. Okay, fine. I don't like her. There, I said it. Thank you. She went to the bathroom one time, and she blew her nose into my jeans. She said, sorry, I thought they were a towel. Who blows their nose into a towel? I don't like her either. Cindy said she cannot get a conversation going with her. And Cindy can talk to anybody. Wait, he's still coming back for the Colts game that night, right? No, he's not coming back. Grandma, T T. Lives in Akron. Hey, I never liked this girl. I like the other ones. You know, the. The. The smart one with the red hair and the sporty one from college. But I never had a good feeling about this girl. And I will tell you right now, if he doesn't come home and watch the Colts game, I don't have a son anymore. Max is gonna have to pick up anyone, and he picks April. She's a moron, an idiot. If breathing wasn't automatic, she'd be dead. Maxwell. Oh, god, no. It's out there now, so I'm just gonna say it. This is not the girl for you. You are Special. You are special, Axel. And April is just not. Yes, she's nice and innocent, and she's got big eyes, and she's like a baby deer in human form. But she's not good enough for you. I'm the boy, mom, and I should just shut up and smile and wear yellow, but not for this girl. I will not stand by quietly and watch you make the biggest mistake of your life. She is not the one for you, Axel. She's not the one. Hey. Got a minute? Uh, sure. So, listen, I know things got pretty crazy before Thanksgiving, but it's water under the bridge, right? You know, your mom. She is how she is. Sometimes she says things in the heat of the moment. But anyway, she's pretty upset about the whole thing, and I don't know if you got it or not, but she sent you a picture of a carrot. Yeah, I got it. It's hilarious. Great. If you could take a minute, shoot her back a text about the carrot? Nope. What do you mean? No, I mean I'm not talking to her. She went too far this time. You can say anything you want about me, but you start taking shots at my lady, we got a problem. You know what I'm saying? No one talks crap about my lady. I hear you, but your mom is my lady. I need you to cut her some slack. I'm sorry about what you Said. And she extended the dirty carrot as a peace offering. Least you could do is accept it. Why should I? Because do not make an inappropriate comment about the dirty carrot. Will be disrespectful to your mother. Oh, you're gonna give less than a disrespect? Maybe you should talk to your wife first. She insulted the girl that I love. The girl who changed my life. Okay, take it down. No, you take it down a notch. They're two assholes now. One before April, one after Angel. When I can talk to you. You just don't get it. Just cause you and mom are dead behind the eyes, doesn't mean I am. The other night, April and I talked until the sun rose. No, I get it. Your girlfriend's great. But you know what? So is your mom. So text her about the carrot. I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. Yeah, and I'm not 5 anymore. I'm not gonna do it just cause you tell me to text your mom about the dirty carrot. Do you know what April would say? She found out mom had the audacity to say she wasn't smart. First you'd have to tell her what audacity meant. What is that supposed to mean? It means your mom is right. Your girlfriend's as dumb as a bag of hammers. And we all think so. I'm out. Not talking to me anymore. And I took sue and Rick down with me.

He's fought hundreds of cases and never lost a single one. No matter what crime his client has committed, as long as the money is there, he can handle anything. As a result, he often faced public anger, so he was forced to hire bodyguards who could protect him wherever he went. But it was clear that the ones he had now weren't up to the task. Luckily, when meeting his clients, found a couple of exceptional people. And the three of them, to get the job done, didn't hesitate to attack the bodyguards. In just a few moves, they knocked out all of them. The lawyer, Jack, deeply shocked. After talking with them, Jack discovered that these three men were from Chelyabinsk in western Siberia. They had been training in boxing since they were young and had won many championships. This time, they came to Moscow to train with their coach, and then they were going to the World Championships. But the three guys from the countryside were blinded by reality when they arrived in Moscow. They secretly signed up for an underground boxing match to earn some extra money, but their coach found out right away and immediately kicked them out. Not knowing what to do, they got into a fight with the lawyer's bodyguard. Jack gave them two options. Either he'd put them in jail himself or they could become his personal bodyguards. With without hesitation, they chose The second option, not to mention the lawyer, gave them a gun permit, a car and of course, a monthly salary of 100,000 rubles. And so a new career began for the three boxing talents. On the day they started, they realized that being bodyguards was no easy job, especially when their boss was a lawyer who could make a lot of money. Once again, Jack won in court, even though the Way's treatment plant had a huge impact on the neighborhood. But legally, there was no problem. The angry neighbors took it out on the lawyer. Once again, the simple Ivan stepped forward and defended Jack from a bottle of unknown liquid. Fortunately, it wasn't a chemical. It was a mix of animal urine. That night, the three of them were once again impressed by the opulence of the rich in Moscow. The lawyer not only had a huge dacha, but also a super sexy wife, Anna. However, Misha thought the face of the lawyer's wife looked familiar. He must have seen her in some small movie. So he decided to find proof to blackmail Anna for some money and then go back to the countryside to live a quiet life. The next day, Jack took on a divorce case. He went to see the boss of a public company who it was very hard to deal with. He didn't want to leave any money to his wife, but he had a perfect asset agreement. Jack tried to persuade Him to accept the divorce, but the boss didn't want to agree. All their preparations didn't work. Jack didn't want to leave, but he didn't know what to say with a blank book. Yuri and Misha were standing in the back. She was watching a video with headphones on, trying to help the lawyer find dirt on his wife. Yuri felt that it was unprofessional and wanted him to stop looking. They both took off their headphones and immediately man's heavy breathing was heard on the phone. When the boss heard this, his face suddenly changed and he asked, where did this video come from? Luckily, Jack reacted quickly, explaining that these videos would appear in court. The boss was stunned and agreed to Jack's plan. So Jack won again. After reaching the elevator, Jack, Jack asked the two men what the video was about. They replied it was a video on how to learn to swim. They expected Jack to scold them, but instead Jack praised them and promised a bonus at the end of the month. The two days as bodyguards went by generally without incident. There were even some surprises. But then a big threat came out of nowhere. In the middle of the night, someone snuck into the lawyer's courtyard and lit a powerful firecracker. The loud explosion woke everyone up. Jack ran out and put out the flames. Looking at the writing on the wall, Jack seemed to realize who did it.

Alright guys, so I know you guys saw the podcast I did with Sophie Rain, and she basically called Aisha out for texting NLE and said that Aisha was lying. So I brought Aisha here today and she reached out and said she had receipts. So what's going on? Okay, so the whole thing with NLE was a lie. I've never met him and I never talked to him in the way that Sophie's making it out to be. Wait, so how did you talk to him? I'm confused. I'll literally show you The messages. Can I read it? Do you mind? Yeah, you can read it. Okay. And LA says, Yo, are you in town? She said, hey. No, what's up? He said, I wanted you to promote the new song, so maybe we can film some. Oh, gotcha. No, I'm in Florida right now. I don't know when I'll be back out in LA. He said, I'll fly you out on a jet. Just let me know. You said, I'll see what I can do. Maybe I can come out there. He said, bet. Can you come on Saturday? And you said, let me check. That's it? That's it? Yeah, that's it. This is it. This isn't even a full scroll. That's what she's saying. That I'm trying to steal her, man. She literally made it seem like you were trying to hook up with him. No, I know, bro. Was just trying to pull through on a brand deal. He was just trying to promote the new song. I'm actually startled. It's crazy, right? What a snake move. She came on your podcast to tell you all that? Just for that? Like, Babe, did she not think the text could be, like, released or, like, talked about? Right? I'm embarrassed. I'm literally embarrassed. She wanted a reason to be mad because she's petty.

When it was too cold at night, she would freeze. That's because she was a candle person. She could only be active at dawn and dusk. This was the only time she and her father could go outside. On this planet, day and night were completely separated. The sun and moon were controlled by two temples. They maintained the balance of day and night time. The administrators of these two temples were also the guardians of the sun and moon respectively. Today was the guardian succession ceremony. This was a grand event she couldn't miss. So the night before, she carefully arranged mirrors inside the house. Once the first ray of sunlight appeared, they would reflect off the mirrors, warming her frozen limbs. This way, before her father had a chance to thaw, she could sneak out using the shadows of trees as cover. The ceremony site was divided into two halves. One half basked in sunlight, the other shrouded in darkness. Because today, both the sun and moon were in the sky simultaneously, Lisa stood at the boundary between light and darkness. Long ago, this world had no light until two warriors appeared. One brought day, the other brought night. The two warriors were Stone King Yang and Blue Elf King Ning respectively. Soon, the succession ceremony officially began. Yang was a man whose body radiated intense heat. His actions and words were loud and crude, but women were completely Crazy about this. On the other hand, Ming was much more lowkey. They all thought becoming guardians was inevitable. As the crowd's cheers rang out, the elderly son Guardian slowly stepped forward. With trembling hands, he raised a mirror high up. A beam of light fell on Yang, indicating the son had chosen him as the new Guardian. But there was a problem on the Moon King's side. The spirit Beast representing the moon didn't choose him. Instead, it picked the young little elf. The Guardian saw the spirit Beast's resolute attitude. He respected its choice. However, King Ming completely turned dark in this election.

Code off my leg, then I swapped it with the Q R code at the store. When the clerk finished packing my items and asked me to pay, I deliberately pulled out my wallet and pretended I did not have enough cash. So the clerk immediately directed me to pay by scanning with my phone. At that moment, she did not know she had walked into the trap I set. After I completed the payment, I picked up the items and left right away. But the clerk stopped me because the clerk saw the system had not received the $2,000 I paid. I hurriedly showed a picture proving my payment succeeded, but I did not expect the clerk to say I had to wait until the money arrived before leaving. I was afraid my scheme had been exposed, so I grabbed the clothes and tried to run, but the clerk physically stopped me. I slipped and fell to the floor while running. Unfortunately, the owner came over at that moment. I immediately put on a pitiful act. Then I showed the owner the payment record. The owner thought that after he scolded the clerk, I would leave, but he did not expect me to demand that he fire her to stop me from causing more trouble. The owner reluctantly fired the clerk. Only then was I satisfied and picked up the bag and left. I did not expect the owner to have already locked the Door, I froze on the spot. I did not expect that when I walked into the store, they recognized me as someone involved in multiple shop scams. So they secretly switch the QR codes. Then the owner took out his phone and transferred all the money I had scammed away. Seeing my plan exposed, I was furious. But I was still a fraudster at that moment, so I could only put on sunglasses and walk away with the items.

Instead, stay calm and avoid sudden movements. Slowly Crouch down to look small and non threatening and don't make eye contact. Calmly back away towards a safe structure like the enclosure walls. If a gorilla approaches, stay still and they might just lose interest. And remember, zoo staff are trained for these emergencies, so wait for their help to escape safely. If you're trapped in a sewer, most people would try to call for help, but sewers are typically too deep underground to be heard. Instead, look for a light source, which should lead you to a manhole. If you don't see any light, try to feel the direction the sewage is flowing and move upstream. This will bring you to smaller tunnels where the sewage is fresher and there are less toxic gases. You can then use your clothes to block a small household pipe that leads into the sewer. This will cause someone's drain to overflow and eventually someone will be called to fix the pipe. If you bend the barrel of a gun and then shot a bullet, most people think it would just cause the gun to explode, but that's not actually what would happen. You see, if you bend the barrel 90 degrees, the curve would slow the bullet down, but it would probably still exit the gun. Now if you bent It all the way back where it was pointing at you. This bend would cause the bullet to get stuck, and the combustion would create a lot of pressure with nowhere to go, potentially causing the gun to explode.

These fluid filled sacs are mostly harmless and usually form over joints. They anchor themselves to the joint using a string like tissue called a stalk, and to remove them a doctor will carefully cut off the stalk. Then the cyst is taken out of the joint and the incision is closed. The parasite enters through the gills and clamps onto the fish's tongue with sharp, strong claws. It then severs the blood vessels in the tongue, stopping blood flow, which causes it to die and eventually fall off. Once the tongue is gone, the parasite attaches itself to the remaining stub, becoming the fish's new tongue. As the fish eats, the parasite gets a share of the food and this creepy thing stays there, living off the fish and acting as its tongue until the host dies. If you fall off of a cruise ship, you could hit at 40 miles per hour, quickly submerging you deep into the water. But if you manage to make it back up, the ship will most likely be too far away, making it almost impossible to be seen. Now if someone saw you fall, they will stop the ship, but these rescue efforts can take a long time, so you'll have to wait in the ocean for hours if they find you at all.

He holds the handlebars and steadying the seat. He patiently explains the basics and gently encourages her not to worry, watching her gradually find her balance and smile happily. He can't help grinning, too. But just then, his friend suddenly shows up. He angrily asks what he's doing, and while they're arguing, the sister has already ridden off confidently. It turns out she did this just to cheer up the hurt boy. Ever since the nanny came to his home, her kindness has made the boy, who lost his mother, feel that long missing warmth. He often lingers nearby, watching the busy figure of the nanny, but he never noticed his father was also secretly watching her and slowly falling in love with her. The next day, his father suddenly announces he's going to marry the nanny. Angry, the boy shouts angrily to provoke his father, but his father just takes the nanny's hand firmly in front of him, unshaken. On the Eve of the wedding, the nanny calls the boy into her room. She plays hide and seek with him, letting him briefly feel his mother's tenderness again. But the next day, she still marries his father. The heartbroken boy holds back his tears, wishes her well, and then leaves the city alone.

The man quickly handed a wooden box to the woman, telling her to jam the car's accelerator with it. The car automatically climbed up along the cliff. But before the two could catch their breath, the monsters attacked again. The man picked up a large machete, swung it wildly and fought against the monsters. It the monsters climbed up, they would be trapped here. The woman also showed no fear. She picked up an axe and chopped at the monsters. They knocked all the monsters off the cliff, but before they could recover from the shock, suddenly another monster rushed over. No. Luckily, the man grabbed the guardrail in time, but the monsters kept swarming in waves. So the man made a brave decision. He took out a small knife and stabbed it deeply into the fuel tank. Gasoline immediately flowed toward the monsters. The man didn't hesitate for a second. He quickly climbed onto the car, opened an incendiary bomb and threw it down. The flames triggered a chain reaction. The monsters were soon burned to ashes. But when the flames spread to the fuel tank, the tank exploded, blowing the monsters into the air. Luckily, The two dodged the explosion with their agile movements to completely eliminate all danger. The woman cut the steel cable completely. They finally got rid of the monster's attack completely.

Thankfully the baby came through without a hitch. But the woman stared in sheer terror. She noticed the child's face looked eerily like the rapists. Her therapist dismissed it as pure delusion. She insisted the attackers fluids had tainted her unborn child. As the kid grew up before her eyes, she couldn't shake that filthy nightmare. One gloomy morning, she finally snapped. The broken woman leaped off the building with the child in her arms. After his wife's death, her husband, a psychiatrist, shattered completely. Yet he soon found a reason to keep breathing. The rapist had only gotten four years behind bars. And when he spotted the guy in court, a sneer curled at the corner of his mouth. Alan vowed revenge. He dove into ways to make someone suffer endlessly without letting them slip away into death, all so the bastard could writhe in agony four years from now. But on the day of the thug's release, he Learned the man had fried in a prison electrical mishap. Alan plunged back into bottomless despair until one patient's story pulled him out. It gave him fresh purpose to endure. The patient's wife had been killed by a drunk driver. His eight year old son lay in a vegetative state. He lode the culprit with every fiber, but his boy's condition held him back from vengeance. Alan saw his own shattered self from four years ago. So he asked the man. Point Blank, want me to take out the driver for you? Alan drugged the perp and tied him to a cross. He approached with a hammer in hand. The driver gaped in raw horror. At the scene, Alan met his gaze with icy detachment. Then he swung the hammer and bashed the man's skull in. As the patient watched his enemy bleed out, a genuine smile broke across his face. At last, the doctor felt the sweet rush of redemption. Over time, he treated 10 more patients, crushed by trauma. Each time he had to end someone's life. He became the nation's most notorious serial killer. That day, Alan reached out to a female reporter. He confessed outright that he was the killer and requested a private one on one interview. The reporter showed up with a detective in tow at a quiet hotel downtown. Alan had booked the room under her name. During check in, she clocked that all the security cams were down for repairs. Before stepping inside, she slipped the spare key card into the elevator, then ducked into the bathroom. She tucked a tiny earpiece communicator into place and covered it with a sweep of her hair. It was her only lifeline to the cop. The reporter entered room 27, 0, 1, while the detective slipped into 2,601 below. He planted hidden cameras all over the space so he could watch every move inside. Then they settled in to wait for Alan's arrival.

I was the only one who actually cooked in our four person house. Every Sunday, I spent hours preparing healthy meals for the week. My three roommates survived on delivery apps and whatever they could steal from my containers. It was just missing Tupperware. Jeff would shrug after eating my chicken and rice, sorry, I was drunk and hungry, became his favourite excuse. Soon, entire rows of meals would vanish overnight. My grocery budget evaporated into their stomachs. They still complained about being too broke for groceries. Bieber was the worst offender by far. I spent three hours one Sunday making lasagna for the week. He ate the entire tray while I was at work. When I confronted him, he just laughed in my face. Maybe if you weren't obsessed with containers, you'd find someone to cook for besides yourself. Bieber's girlfriend, Taylor, basically moved in without paying rent. She didn't just eat my food like the others. She photographed my meals for her Instagram before destroying them. Her captions claim she made everything herself. She promoted her meal prep journey while eating my entire week's food in two days. My containers would disappear into her car for weeks, return stained, warped and sometimes mouldy. I tried the polite approach. One evening I asked if they could reimburse me for groceries. Taylor rolled her eyes dramatically at my request. It's just food. You're Being really weird about this. Never. Immediately took her side without hesitation. Yeah, stop being so territorial. Sharing is caring, right? Our house meeting was my final attempt at reason. I spend $80 weekly on groceries. You guys eat most of it. Can we please work out a system? Jeff jumped in with his prepared complaints. Your meal prep takes up the entire fridge. Maybe stop hoarding space with containers.

My wife and I each brought a daughter from previous relationships into our marriage. Despite being only a year apart in age, our daughters were completely different. And that's why I'm here. My daughter has always been athletic and outgoing. Growing up, she played basketball, softball, soccer, volleyball, and even golf. In middle school, she picked up tennis and never looked back. I paid for her to have private lessons, and when she found out how much I was paying for those lessons, she decided that's what she wants to do as her teenage job. She's now a junior, is one of the best players on her HS team, and teaching tennis lessons. She teaches elementary school kids and charges $75 per hour per kid. With her skills and outgoing personality, she has a waiting list of kids and makes about $1,200 a week. She could make more, but I limit her hours so that she can concentrate on school. My stepdaughter is reserved and not very athletic. We always tried to sign her up to the same sport and team with my daughter, but she either object or quit a couple of weeks in. I get it. Sports is not for everyone, so I never made her feel bad about it. She recently turned 16 and got a job at a burger place nearby. She's making $13 an hour and brings home less than $200 a Week my daughter recently decided that she wants to be independent by buying her clothes and electronics with her own money.

Yet, as the boy lay dying, a single drop of blood unexpectedly fell into his wound, fusing with his genes and thereby unlocking the door to another world. The Lion King sensed this and decided to spare the boy. After receiving medical treatment, the boy returned home only to find the lion had been killed by his father. Realizing his father's cruelty, they had a fierce argument. That night, Clive quietly left home and headed for his mother's homeland. Upon arrival, Clive saw a massive herd of cattle charging toward him. The grassland stretched endlessly, offering no place to hide. To his surprise, the herd didn't collide with him, but instead veered away. Looking up, he saw the herd leader standing guard before him as if connected by telepathy. Only after the herd dispersed and his safety was assured did the bull king depart. Clevin then realized his body had transformed. With a gentle pull, his arrows now flew over 100 meters. Moreover, his speed, explosive power and hearing fart.

If there's infidelity, I think that'd be a fair reason to not not be subject to alimony whether you're the man or the woman. But the reality is, is that I think it's something like 97% of alimony payments go from men to women.

Each pattern seemed to tell an untold story. His gaze was fierce and profound, like a beast radiating a chilling killing intent. No one knew where he came from or why he was incarcerated. All they knew was that this man was no ordinary person. The warden merely glanced at him and immediately sensed an unprecedented aura of danger, a fear that penetrated deep into his soul. So he ordered the highest security protocols of the prison to be activated. On Jack's first day in the prison, he was provoked by four prison bullies. With a wave of the bully leader's hand, 20 strong men surrounded him with iron weapons. In the face of this situation, the new inmate named Jack revealed his powerful muscles. One man stepped forward and swung at his head, but Jack didn't fall. Instead, he coldly stared back at him. Seeing Jack's incredible resistance, everyone rushed at him. The bully leader made a kill him gesture unexpectedly. This completely enraged Jack. In an instant, he struck and sent several strong men flying. Jack then made a gesture for everyone to come at him together. The remaining men, unhesitant, prepared to give him a beating.

That evening, I came home to find her suitcases packed. She asked me one question, do you hate me? I said, no, I just finally love myself enough not to be quiet anymore. She left that night. I locked the door, turned off my phone and slept better than I had in years. Sometimes the quietest revenge is just refusing to be a placeholder anymore.

I nodded. Later that night, I left a box on her side of the bed. When she opened it, she started crying and didn't sleep for three days. So this happened last month, and I'm still processing everything. I'm 52. Been married to my wife Jennifer for 18 years. I'm a machinist. I run precision equipment and manage a team. I'm not rich, but I've always provided, fixed things, covered her mistakes, paid off her maxed out credit cards more times than I can count. Last Tuesday, I was folding laundry in the basement. Jennifer walked in, tossed her blouse in the dryer, and just laughed. Dry, cold laugh. Then she said it. You're lucky I even let you touch me. Like I was some gross stranger who won a contest or something. She just hummed and walked away like it was nothing. But something inside me clicked. Not anger. Something quieter. Colder. I folded the rest of the clothes and went to my office. See, I'd noticed things for months. Her phone always buzzing, her giggling at texts like she was a teenager again. Client dinners that never showed up on our joint credit card. Tuesday evening training retreats that seemed frequent. Six months ago, I'd synced her phone to our family iPad. She thought it was just for Netflix. It wasn't. I opened my laptop and started going through everything. Emails from her realtor friend mentioning fun, Weekends at the Birchstone Hotel on dates that matched her supposed work retreats. Rental car receipts with a second driver listed. Not me. Then the texts. My stomach dropped. One message stood out. Can't wait to see you outside the sheets for once. Lowell. The guy responded with a shirtless mirror pic. Recognize the bathroom? The birchstone again. That hotel always smelled like cheap lavender. The guy? A contractor we hired last summer to fix our deck. I gave him beer. He thanked me, shook my hand. I kept digging. Her car's GPS tracking. Three separate Tuesday visits to a downtown condo. She always told me she hated down

When I was 10, my older sister Megan went missing on a random Thursday in October. She was 14. Walked to school like any other day, but never came home. Mom called all her friends. Dad drove around the neighborhood until 3:00am. By Friday morning, police cars were parked outside our house. For the first week, our kitchen stayed busy. Neighbors brought casseroles. My aunt made sandwiches. Officers drank coffee and asked the same questions over and over. Did Megan seem upset? Was she meeting anyone? Did she have money? Mom answered while dad paced around our living room, checking his phone every 30 seconds. But after two weeks, the casseroles stopped coming. The police visits got shorter. Mom stopped cooking altogether. She'd sit at the kitchen table, staring at me. In school schedule that was still stuck to the fridge with a magnet shaped like a pizza slice. Dad would come home from work and heat up whatever he could find. Usually nothing. One night, I got hungry around nine PM. Mom was on the couch watching the news. Dad was in his office making more phone calls to people who had no answers. I went to the kitchen and opened the fridge. There wasn't much. Some expired milk, a half empty jar of pickles, and one slice of cold pizza from three days ago when dad ordered food and nobody ate it. I grabbed the pizza and a warm Coke from The counter. Instead of eating in the kitchen, I walked upstairs to Megan's room. The door was still open. Her bed was unmade from the morning she left. Her backpack was gone, but her favorite purple hoodie wasn't hanging on her chair like it usually was. That's when I first noticed it was missing. I sat cross legged on her carpet, looking around her room. Her posters of some boy band I didn't know were still taped to the wall. Her desk still had homework. She never turned in. Her shoes were lined up by her closet. Everything looked normal, except she wasn't there. I took a bite of the cold pizza. It tasted like cardboard. The cheese was rubbery and the sauce was too sweet. But I ate it slowly anyway, pretending Megan was just downstairs watching TV or in the bathroom brushing her teeth. I kept waiting to hear her footsteps in the hallway or her voice calling for mom. The pizza took me twenty minutes to finish. Each bite was harder than the last. Coke was flat and too warm. But I drank it because sitting in her room doing nothing felt worse. I kept looking at her bed, imagining her lying there complaining about homework or asking me to get out of her room like she always did. When I finished eating, I just sat there for another hour. Mom never came looking for me. Dad never called my name. House was completely quiet except for The sound of cars driving past our street. Normal cars with normal families going normal places. I wondered if Megan was in one of those cars trying to get home. After that night, I couldn't eat pizza anymore. Even the smell made my stomach hurt. When kids at school had pizza parties, I'd make excuses. When dad suggested ordering pizza for dinner, I'd ask for something else. Mom and dad never asked why. They had their own things they couldn't do anymore. Three months later, the police told us they were scaling back the search. They said they'd keep Megan's case open, but they had to focus on other things. Mom cried for two days straight. Dad punched a hole in the garage wall. I went back to Megan's room and sat in the same spot where I ate that pizza. Her purple hoodie never turned up. Not in her school locker, not at any of her friends houses, not anywhere the police looked. Mom kept asking everyone about it. Like finding the hoodie would bring Megan back. But nobody had seen it. We moved to a different house six months later. Mom said she couldn't live in a place with so many memories. Dad said we needed a fresh start. I never told them that the real

You've had it long enough. My husband nodded in agreement. I smiled, took a sip of wine and said, interesting, since when do you own my house? The fork my father in law was holding clattered to his plate. We're giving your house to Steven. You've had it long enough. My father in law Richard said it while carving the Turkey, casual like announcing dessert. Steven was my husband's younger brother, 32, never held a job longer than six months. My husband Trevor nodded. It makes sense, Babe. Steven needs it more. I took a sip of wine, set down my glass carefully. Interesting. Since when do you own my house? The fork Richard was holding clatter to his plate. What? My house? The one I bought three years before I met Trevor. The one that's solely in my name. Richard's face went red. Don't be ridiculous. You're married. What's yours is ours. No, what's mine is mine. We never put Trevor's name on the deed. Trevor's mother Linda chimed in. That's just a technicality. Marital property only applies to assets acquired during marriage. I bought the house before we met. It's separate property. Silence. I pulled out my phone, opened a document. This is the deed. See only my name. Purchased February 2019. We got married June 2022. Trevor grabbed my phone, stared at the screen. You never told me it wasn't in both our Names you never asked. You assumed. Richard stood up. This is unacceptable. Steven has two kids. He needs that house. Then Steven should buy his own house. He can't afford it. Not my problem. Linda gasped. How can you be so selfish? Selfish? You just tried to give away my house without asking me even. Finally spoke up. I didn't know about this dad. I thought, thought what? I looked at him. That I just hand over a 450,000 dollar house because your father demanded it? Trevor's voice.

I'll take very good care of her tonight. He walked away. Sophia followed. Everyone saw it. Nobody said anything. I stood there holding that dollar while my marriage walked out the door. I didn't explode. I didn't make a scene. I drove home calm as ice. By two a m, I changed every lock in the house. By. By 4:00am, I contacted a lawyer. By 6:00am, I'd moved all her stuff to the garage. By 8:00am, I'd called her boss at the tech company's corporate office. Turns out Brendan wasn't the CEO. He was a regional manager. And his actual boss? A guy named Tom Richards, who happened to be my client. He'd ordered a 7,500 dollar custom smoker from me three months ago. We'd become friends. One phone call. That's all it took. Around noon, Sophia came home to find her key didn't work. She started banging on the door, screaming. I opened it, handed her the garage clicker and said, your stuff's in there. The locks are changed. My lawyer will contact you. Her face went white. Jake, we can fix this. That's when her phone rang. Brendan on speak. You didn't tell me your husband was Tom Richards's personal friend. He screamed. I just got fired. They're investigating me for inappropriate workplace relationships. My wife found out. You cost me everything. Sophia looked at me, finally understanding. I didn't throw the dollar back. At Brendan instead. I framed it in my workshop with a plaque underneath. Respect the man with grease on his hands. He probably signed your paycheck. That photo went viral. Six months later, my business is booming. Turns out being the BQ Guy who handled his divorce with dignity is great marketing. I started a new product line called the Loyalty Series. Sophia works at a small agency now. Drives a 15 year old Honda, lives in a one bedroom apartment. Brendan? Last I heard, he's selling used cars in Florida. And me? I'm teaching my kids that character matters more than cash. And that revenge is best served low and slow. Just like good BBQ.

I was wearing bring my hair in a low ponytail. I've been growing it out for three years, ever since I had to shave my head in eighth grade after an accident. It took forever to grow back, and I was so proud. It was down to the middle of my back. Patrick walked up, grabbed my ponytail, yanked it hard, and I heard this loud snip sound. I reached back and felt where my hair used to be. It gone. Cut off at shoulder length. I whipped around, and there was Patrick holding my severed ponytail in one hand and the Scissors in the other with this satisfied smirk. Dana screamed. Whole class went silent. I lost it. Grabbed the Scissors from his hand and shoved him as hard as I could. He crashed into a desk. Our teacher started yelling. Security came and dragged Patrick out. He got suspended for a week. Three days later, there was a knock on our door. My mom answered and called me downstairs. Patrick's father was standing there in an expense suit. Next To a woman with a briefcase. He said his son told him everything about how I violently assaulted Patrick unprovoked, and caused him emotional trauma. The woman was their lawyer, and they were suing me for assault and battery. My mom asked if he was serious. He showed us medical bills, for therapy sessions, for the trauma I allegedly caused. My mom said, your son cut off my daughter's hair with Scissors. That's assault. Patrick's dad said, actually, that's destruction of property. And claimed I've been bullying Patrick for months. I pulled out my phone and showed the security footage from school. It clearly showed Patrick sneaking up behind me with Scissors, cutting my hair, then me defending myself. Patrick's dad's face went pale. The lawyer whispered something to him. He stammered and said, we'll be in touch. They left. We never heard from them again. Patrick got expelled. Dana broke up with him the day after. I cut my hair into a Bob, and honestly, it looked better than before.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler who said she was being a total bitch. But I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my fitness pal that night and started tracking everything, cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee With extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. I noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better. And she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

Friday night, I went out with co workers for happy hour. Turned into dinner, turned into bar hopping until midnight. Got home to find every light in the house on and Cassidy sitting on the couch in the dark living room, staring at the wall. Where were you? Her voice cracked out. You didn't text me. I stopped halfway to the bedroom, turned around slowly. You told me to stop bothering you, so I stopped bothering you. You wanted to decide when we spend time together. I'm still waiting for you to decide. Her face went pale. I didn't mean. You meant exactly what you said. And I'm giving you exactly what you asked for. She started crying. I went to bed. Saturday morning, I woke up to 17 missed calls and 43 text messages, all from her. All variations of we need to talk and where are you? I was at the gym. That's When she showed up at my office Monday morning. I work in an open floor plan, 30 desks, all visible to each other. She walked in at 10:00am, mascara running down her face, and made a scene in front of my entire team. You've been ignoring me for two weeks. My boss stood up from his desk. And you need to. We're married. He can't just stop talking to me. I stayed seated, kept my voice calm. You said you decide when we spend time together. I'm still waiting for you to decide. That's not what I meant. Then what did you mean? She couldn't answer. Just stood there crying while my coworkers stared. My boss had to walk her out. HR called me in an hour later. I explained everything, showed them the text where she said, stop bothering me. They said they understood, but asked me to work from home for the rest of the week. That's when I realized she never wanted space. She wanted me to chase her while she ignored me. She wanted the comfort of knowing I'd always be there, always asking, always trying, while she got to decide if I was worth her time. I'm filing for divorce next week.

This isn't real money. I gestured at hundreds of people. Then why are they spending their fake money here every night? A few customers actually clapped. Mom cleared her throat. If this business is doing so well, maybe we should discuss a partnership. I stared, then laughed so loud people turned. You ignored me, humiliated me, gave me nothing. And now you want a piece? Emily crossed her arms. It's family money now. I forward. You already got your share. Live with it. Six months later, they were back, all of them desperate. Emily needed $200,000 to save the beach house she'd refinanced three times. Mom and dad's business was bleeding. They needed $500,000. You're successful now, dad said, exhausted. You can afford it. I crossed my arms. So now I'm successful? Mom snapped. Don't be a brat. We're your family. I let that hang, then smiled. Let me tell you about family. Family doesn't mock you when you're struggling. Family doesn't treat you like a joke. Family doesn't show up only when they need something, dad muttered. Logan, please. You made your choices, I said, gesturing to my empire. And I made mine. I'm not giving you a cent. But I wasn't done. While they drowned in debt, I'd been expanding, buying property, including their house. Mom's face went white when I showed her the email. No. You mean the house you said wasn't my home anymore? She grabbed my arm. Please, Logan, we'll do Anything, I pulled away. Now you understand what it feels like. I pulled out a contract I'd already prepared. I'll let you live in it, but I own it. And you'll pay me rent every single month. Dad's hands shook. How much? I named my price. High enough they'd feel it every month. Mom's face twisted. You're charging us to live in our own home? No, I grinned. I'm charging you to live in my home. Silence. With trembling hands, they signed. They spent their lives treating me like nothing. Now I owned their home, their future. I owned them. And as I walked back into my business, I smiled. They thought I'd be nothing now I owned everything.

You can always sleep under the stars, they snickered. But when I turned it into a business, they wanted to share. I should have known this dinner was a setup. My parents never invited me over unless they needed something, usually to remind me I was the family disappointment. My sister, Emily, their golden child, never worked a day but somehow deserved everything. Dad folded his newspaper. We're dividing our assets. Emily lit up instantly. Mom smiled. We're giving you the beach house, sweetheart. Emily gasped like she'd won an Oscar, the one in Malibu. Then dad turned to me, expression flat. And you, Logan, we're giving you the parking lot. Silence. The what? The old lot on 8th Street, mom said, waving dismissively. It's land. Figure something out. Emily burst out laughing. At least you'll always have a place to sleep under the stars, dad chuckled. Maybe open a lemonade stand or something. I stared at them. This wasn't even disguised kindness. This, it was straight garbage. A memory flashed me at 16, holding my first paycheck from the auto shop. So proud, dad didn't even look up. You're going to smell like oil for the rest of your life. That same week, they bought Emily a brand new BMW. I pushed back from the table. You're serious, dad shrugged. You should be grateful, I stood. I'll make something of it. Emily rolled her Eyes can't wait to see what you do with a slab of concrete. Three weeks later, I had permits for food trucks. I took out a loan from my boss, a guy who actually believed in hard work, and set up lights, seating, banners. That worthless parking lot became a full blown food court with live music and lines around the block. Month in, mom showed up in her expensive coat, wrinkling her nose at the crowd. So this is what you've done? I didn't look at her. You gave me trash. I made it work. This isn't a real business, she sniffed. It's just a phase. I laughed. A phase making more than Emily's influencer career. Her face twitched. Emily appeared, stopping dead. You turn this into what is this? A flea market. It's called a successful business. This is a.

And when the kid offered me some of his stale candy, I took it. We sat there eating old chocolate bars in silence. When the parents finally came home, they walked in calling for me, and I had to yell that I was in the attic. They came upstairs, saw me sitting there covered in dust next to their kids, surrounded by candy wrappers, completely lost it, laughing. They put the chair back. I climbed down with whatever dignity I had left and they handed me an extra 20 as an apology. I told them straight up I was never babysitting again. And they said they completely understood. But, and a week later, I saw them at the grocery store and the mom came over to apologize again. She said the twins felt bad. And I said, no, they absolutely don't. She laughed and admitted I was right, that they thought it was the greatest prank ever. Then she asked if I'd babysit again for triple the rate. My bank account made the decision before my brain could stop it, and I agreed. The next weekend, I showed up with my own ladder. Feeling pretty confident, I told the kids I knew all their tricks now and they weren't getting me twice. They just looked at each other and smiled, which should have been a massive red flag. Everything went fine for the first hour. Both kids even went to the bathroom. One at a time without incident. And I started to relax. That's when I heard the front door open and close. I ran to check and both kids had just vanished. After searching inside, I heard laughing from the backyard and found them both sitting in their treehouse eating more candy. They'd apparently hidden out there earlier. I told them to come down immediately and they both said no in perfect unison. So I sat down in the grass and just waited them out. 15 minutes later, they got bored and climbed down on their own. When the mom came home early, she paid me triple like she'd promised and said she didn't blame me for quitting. I told her these kids were professional level pranksters. She said, yeah, they get it from their dad. And right then he walked in from the garage wearing a vampire costume matching the twins. He'd been hiding out there filming everything the entire time.

I tried to stay calm. I'm glad she sees me as a paternal figure. I've been. You don't have any children. She cut me off. She's mine, not yours. Not your daughter. I took a breath. I've been raising her for seven years. I think I've earned. You've earned nothing. Her voice was ice cold. Now, if my husband came back from the dead right now, I would divorce you in an instant. For him. Do you understand that? In an instant. That hurt. But she wasn't done. Don't act so high and mighty because you help my daughter with homework sometimes or build stupid plastic figurines together. No matter how many bed time stories you read her, you are not and will never be her father. We've been sleeping in separate rooms since then. It's been three days. Last night I went up to my stepdaughter's room to apologize for all the shouting. She was lying in bed, still reading her new books. Is this my fault? She asked quietly. No, I said immediately. Never. Your mom is just insecure because we get along so well. But this is not and will never be your fault. I hope she believes me. I've been thinking a lot about everything. About the last 10 years. About what my wife said. About how I'll always be second place to a ghost. And yesterday I made a decision. I called a lawyer. Three months have passed since That night, I left. Packed my things and moved into an apartment across town. My stepdaughter keeps calling me, confused and upset. She doesn't understand why I had to go. And honestly, that breaks my heart more than anything my wife said. But I couldn't stay. I deserved more than being treated like a placeholder. Like my bond with this kid I raised didn't matter. My wife's been calling, too, begging me to come back. But it's not because she loves me or sees me as her partner. Her voicemails make that clear. Nobody's taking care of her. She says she needs you here. Not I need you, not I miss you. Just. She needs you. The divorce papers are filed. My lawyer says it should be finalized in a few months. Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice. Then I remember what my wife said. That she traded me in a heartbeat for a dead man. And I know I did.

So I am taking this relationship to the grave. I've been with my wife for 10 years, married for six. Her late husband died when their daughter was just a year old. That daughter's 13 now and I've known her since she was 3. Here's the thing about my marriage. I've always known I'm not first in my wife's eyes. She goes to his grave every single day after work, every day, rain, snow, doesn't matter. Then every weekend, she takes their daughter there for an hour so she can spend and time with her dad. I never made a big deal about it. I'm not the kind of guy who needs constant attention anyway. I work from home as an online tutor. So when Covid hit and schools went remote, my stepdaughter was home with me all day while her mom kept going to the office. That's when we really bonded. We built Gundam models together, stayed up late discussing Percy Jackson theories, and I'd help her with homework at the kitchen table. She got into hockey, then baseball, then quit both to focus on dance. She's incredible at it, too. So advanced for her age that she landed the lead role as the princess in her studio's Nutcracker production last December. Her mom never came to a single game, not one recital, too. Busy visiting a cemetery, I guess. Yesterday was my stepdaughter's birthday. I've been searching online for weeks and finally found this special edition box set of the Heroes of Olympus, the second series in the Percy Jackson universe. It's been out of print for years, but I tracked one down. When she opened it, she literally screamed, jumped up, hugged me so tight I could barely breathe and said, thank you so much, dad. I didn't correct her, just smiled because honestly, I've raised this kid for almost 7 years. I make her breakfast, help with her math homework, listen to her talk about drama with her dance friends, drive her to practice four times a week. If that doesn't make me her dad, I don't know what does. Her mother drilled it into her head when she was little that she could only call me by my first name or mommy's friend, never dad, never anything close. My stepdaughter ran upstairs to start reading her new books and that's when my wife turned on me. You're not her dad, she hissed. How could you ever be her dad? How dare.

I was driving out of my gated community when this lady jumped off the curb right in front of my car. She was screaming and waving her arms like she was directing airplane traffic. I slammed my brakes and coffee went everywhere. She rushed to my window, demanding to know if I lived there. Her face was red and spit flew as she yelled about watching me drive through her neighborhood. Her husband jogged over, looking mortified in his cargo shorts and polo shirt. Karen, please, he said, grabbing her elbow. This is our neighbor from the blue house. She shook him off and demanded my driver's license like she was neighborhood security. Her pom pom slippers made her authority act even more ridiculous. Instead of getting mad, I just started laughing. You know what? Come over for drinks this afternoon. Let's get to know each other better as neighbors. The husband's jaw dropped. That's. That's very kind of you. Karen kept sputtering about documentation while her husband dragged her away apologizing. I drove home sticky with coffee, but oddly amused by the whole thing. Four hours later, I walked to their house carrying red and white wine. Mitchell answered, looking shocked. I actually came behind him! Karen shrieked. Absolutely not! From their living room. Mitchell's face went crimson as he stood in the doorway doing that awkward shuffle. I'm so sorry. She's. She's not feeling social. But maybe I could stop by your Place in an hour. I shrugged and walked home. Sure enough, an hour later, Mitchell knocked, carrying a six pack. We sat on my porch and he practically collapsed into a chair. I'm really sorry about this morning. Karen's been getting worse lately. She watches the neighborhood Facebook page like it's her job. We cracked open beers and talked. Mitchell was a software engineer who worked from home and seemed desperate for normal conversation. We discovered we both loved craft beer and hated the HOA rules. After his third beer, he admitted Karen had called the police on three other neighbors this month alone. I keep telling her she's going to get us sued, but she think she's protecting property values, he said miserably. We ordered pizza and moved inside to watch the game. Mitchell relaxed for the first time all day. He kept thanking me for being understanding and not filing a complaint about the morning incident. You know what's crazy? Mitchell said during halftime. In 23 years of marriage, this is the first time I've just hung out with a friend without asking permission. We were laughing about the HOA's latest ridiculous rule about grass height when Mitchell's phone started buzzing. He ignored it. Then it rang and rang and rang. Maybe you should answer, I suggested. Mitchell shook his head. She's probably calling to demand I come home. For once, I'm going to enjoy my evening. His phone finally stopped. We high fived and opened another beer. The third quarter had just started when I noticed something odd. A car had driven past my house three times, then another. They we're moving slowly, like they were looking for addresses. Hey, Mitchell, does Karen know my exact house number? No. Why? That's when we heard the sirens. Not just one or two, but what sounded like every cop car in the county. The noise got louder and louder until red and blue lights were flashing through every window. I peeked through the blinds, and my blood went cold. Multiple police cars had surrounded my house. Officers were taking positions behind their vehicles with weapons drawn. More cars kept arriving. I could see officers moving through my backyard. They had the whole property surrounded. Oh, my God! Mitchell whispered, looking through another window. What did she tell them? In my driveway, I could see Karen talking animatedly to what looked like a police captain. She was gesturing wildly at my house, and I could see her mouth forming words that looked like dangerous and hostage. Even from here, her pom pom slippers looked ridiculous against the severity of what was happening. A megaphone crackled to life. This is the police. We. We have the house completely surrounded. We know you're in there. Mitchell and I looked at each other in terror. Whatever Karen had told them, it was clearly more than just my husband is watching football. The tactical positions the officers were taking suggested they thought something serious. Was happening inside. Should I go out there? Mitchell asked, his face pale. Wait, I said. Let me think. If she told. Tell them you're in danger and you walk out, fine. They'll know she lied. But if they think I'm dangerous. The megaphone crackled again. You have 30 seconds to respond before we escalate. Release the hostage immediately. Hostage? She told them Mitchell was a hostage. My hands started shaking as I realized how bad this could get. At one wrong move, and this could end with me dead on my own living room floor. Mitchell reached for the door handle, but I grabbed his arm. Outside, I could hear more sirens approaching. Whatever happened next would happen fast. Through the window, I saw an officer with S W A T. Gear arriving on scene. The megaphone counted down. 20 seconds. My heart was pounding so hard I could barely breathe. Mitchell looked at me with panic in his eyes as we both realized Karen might have finally gone too far. 10 seconds. Full story link below.

What's it like? My family lived by one rule. You pay what you owe, no matter the cost. So when I was 19 and found out my father had borrowed 200,000 from the Kozlov family, I knew our lives were over. My father sat at the kitchen table with his head in his hands while my mother paced and chain smoked. The deadline was three days away, and we had nothing. Then Boris Kozlov himself showed up at our door with his son Nikolai. Boris looked at me the way you'd examine a car before buying it. He turned to my father and said, your debt disappears tonight if she marries my son. My father didn't even look at me before agreeing. My mother just lit another cigarette and stared at the wall. The wedding happened in Boris's basement. No dress, no flowers. Just papers to sign and men with guns watching. Nikolai was 28 and had dead eyes. After the ceremony, he leaned close and whispered, your currency. Nothing more. Remember that? The abuse started that first night. He showed me a room in his house with no windows and a lock on the outside. He said that's where I'd live if I caused problems. He monitored my phone calls and read my texts. If I took too long at the grocery store, he'd show up and drag me out by my arm. He'd remind me what his family did to people who betrayed them. How they Made examples of entire bloodlines. He installed cameras in every room except the bathroom. When I showered, he'd bang on the door after exactly 10 minutes. He picked my clothes each morning and inspected me before we left the house. If my makeup wasn't right, he'd wipe it off roughly and reapply it himself. He weighed me every week and controlled my portions at meals. Every week we had dinner at Boris's house. I had to sit silent while they discussed their business like I wasn't there. Drug shipments, territory disputes, names of people who wouldn't be problems anymore. Nikolai would rest his hand on my knee under the table, squeezing harder if I showed any reaction. His mother would smile at me and say things like, such a good girl, knows her place. My parents called once a month to make sure I was being good. They never asked if I was happy or safe. Just reminded me that my father's life depended on my cooperation. My younger sister wasn't allowed to talk to me because they didn't want her getting ideas. The breaking point came when Nikolai brought home another woman. He made me serve them dinner while they laughed and touched each other. When I dropped a plate, he backhanded me in front of her. She laughed and said, is this the debt payment? She's not even pretty. That night, while they were in our bedroom, I sat in the kitchen and realised I'd rather die trying. To escape than live another day as property, I started planning carefully. I saved grocery money in tiny amounts and hid cash and tampon boxes. I memorised bus schedule and studied maps. During my allowed library time, I smiled more, acted docile, made Nikolai believe I was finally broken. It took six months to save enough for a bus ticket to another state. I practiced walking with different postures in the bathroom mirror and studied accents on YouTube videos during my supervised internet time. You belong to us, I had said once. There's nowhere we won't find you. The night I ran, I left during his poker game, when he'd be distracted for hours. I took nothing but the cash and clothes I could layer. I've been putting sleeping pills in his vodka for weeks. Tiny amounts, so he'd be groggy but not suspicious. At the bus station, I threw away my phone and bought a ticket with shaking hands. For 48 hours, I didn't sleep, certain every stop would bring men with guns. I which buses three times and doubled back twice to confuse anyone following. In a truck stop bathroom, I cut my hair with stolen Scissors and dyed it black with a box kit. I traded my coat with a homeless woman and bought men's clothes from a thrift store. By the time I reached my destination, I looked nothing like the girl who'd fled. I ended up in a small mountain town where I got a Job washing dishes under a fake name. For two years, I jumped at every car door slam and every Russian accent. I moved constantly, never made friends, worked jobs that paid cash.

I was babysitting my neighbour's twin boys on Halloween night. And looking back, I should have known better. These kids were eight years old, both dressed as vampires, and they had this look in their eyes that screamed trouble. Their parents said they'd be home by 11, handed me 20 bucks for pizza and left me alone with what I can only describe as chaos in tiny costumes. The first hour went surprisingly smooth. We ordered pizza, settled in to watch some Halloween movie, and I actually started thinking this was going to be the easiest money I'd ever made. Then about 20 minutes into the movie, one of the twins said he needed to use the back bathroom. I said sure and went back to watching. Five minutes passed, then 10, and I started getting this uneasy feeling. I called out asking if everything was okay, but got complete silence back. I got up and checked the bathroom, which was totally empty, started going room to room calling his name. And the whole time the other twin was just sitting on the couch with this creepy little smile on his face. I asked him where his brother went and he gave me the most casual shrug I'd ever seen and said he didn't know. I was about two minutes away from calling the police when I heard this faint giggling sound coming from somewhere above me. I Looked up at the ceiling and noticed the attic access panel in the hallway was hanging wide open. That little nightmare was out there laughing at me. I dragged a chair over, climbed up and poked my head through to find him sitting cross legged in the corner eating candy from this huge box. Apparently their parents had stashed last year's Halloween candy up there and forgotten about it. I told him to get down here right now and he looked me dead in the eye and said no. So I made the absolutely brilliant decision to climb all the way up into that attic to drag him down myself. The exact second I got both feet onto the attic floor, I heard his twin brother downstairs drag the chair away from under the opening. Then came the laughing. I was stuck in a dusty attic with an 8 year old eating year old candy while his brother had successfully trapped us both up there. I tried yelling for him to bring the chair back, but he just kept wiggling and running around. The kid next to me looked over and said completely casual, we're trapped now. After about 20 minutes of calling their parents non stop, they finally picked up. I explained that I was literally stuck in their attic and instead of concern, they burst out laughing. They said they were at a restaurant in the next town and would be home in 30 minutes. So I accept.

I responded once. I'm respecting the boundaries you set. Their father can handle their education. She came home early. Kids still at school, furious. You're seriously pulling them out over a conversation? I'm not pulling them out. You or their father can pay. You know I can't afford that. In public school it is. You're punishing children. No, I'm respecting your wishes. Dads pay for private school. Mom's boyfriends who need to know their place don't. Thursday, new insurance cards arrived. Only mine. Where are the kids cards? They're not on my insurance anymore. She went ballistic. He needs ADHD medication. She has therapy. Their father has insurance, doesn't he? Basic coverage that covers nothing. Better figure that out. That's when she threatened. If you do this, we're done. Okay, that's it. You established I'm not family. Boyfriends don't have obligations to kids that aren't theirs. The financial reality hit her hard. Without my contributions, rent, insurance, insurance, phones, groceries, utilities, gas. About thirty eight hundred more per month. Her salary after taxes? Thirty two hundred monthly. The math didn't work. And came desperation. She contacted her ex, telling him I was abandoning his kids. He actually called me. What's going on? I explained everything. Wait, you were paying for private school? Everything. He laughed and forwarded me a voicemail from three years ago. Michelle. Telling him the kids didn't need him because they had me as a father figure. The kids found out about switching schools. Her son Lost it. He was supposed to be team captain. Already being scouted for scholarships. Her daughter cried about leaving friends she'd had since second grade. They blamed Michelle. She blamed me. Michelle had to move to a smaller apartment in a worse neighborhood. Both kids struggled in public school. One night, the daughter showed up at my door with a suitcase. Mom says, you're not my dad, but you're the only dad I've known. Can I stay? I called Michelle immediately. Come get her. You made it clear. I'm not her parent. The girl cried. Why can't I stay with Dad? Michelle snapped. He's not your dad. He's more dad than Garrett ever was. But I held firm boundaries. Right. Ran into Michelle at a coffee shop last week. She looked exhausted, older. The kids miss you. I miss you. We could try again. No. You loved those kids. Past tense. You made sure of that when you told me they weren't mine to love. As a father, I made a mistake. You made a choice. Live with it. She texted that night, you destroyed our family. I replied, there was no our family. There was your family. And I was just your boyfriend who needed to know his place. I know my place now. Then I blocked her. Sometimes you don't realize what you have until it's gone. And sometimes by then, it's too late.

Lisa scrolled through my Venmo history with her mouth pressed into a thin line. Honey, I think he has been pocketing your money. She printed out the payment history and handed it to me. You need to document everything and probably call the police. I asked Lisa if she could meet me at the apartment that evening when Jason got home from work. I'm not sure if she said yes because she wanted her money or if she just wanted to see what was about to go down. But either way, she showed up. Jason walked through the door and stopped dead when he saw both of us sitting at the kitchen table with printed documents spread out between us. What's going on? He asked, dropping his backpack. Lisa didn't waste any time. You haven't paid rent in three months even though your roommate gave you the money for all of it. I've encouraged him to police report for theft. Jason's face went white. There's been a banking error. My account got flagged. Lisa held up her hand. I don't want to hear any excuses. I already contacted an attorney, Lisa said. I'm evicting you effective immediately. You have 72 hours to leave the property. Jason stared at all of the papers on the table like they might disappear if he looked hard enough. This isn't what it looks like, he said. Then what is it? I asked. He opened his mouth. But nothing came out. Lisa stood up and looked directly at me. You're not responsible for his theft and I'll make sure your credit won't be affected. I'm removing his name from the list today. You can stay if you want or I'll release you from the lease with no penalty. Jason finally found his voice. Come on, we're friends. You're really going to ruin my life over this. I looked at him sitting there next to the gaming console he bought with my rent money. Friends don't steal from each other. Jason opened his mouth to defend himself, but I kept going. I'm filing a police report tonight and I'm sending everything to your parents so they know exactly what you did with their money. Two days later, Jason was gone. His room completely empty, except for the gaming console box in the corner that he apparently couldn't take with him. He had to move into his parents basement.

So I stopped paying. For five years, I was dad in every way that mattered. School pickups, soccer practice, homework help, sick days, parent teacher conferences. I taught her son to drive, helped her daughter with science fair projects, paid for their phones, clothes, everything. Most importantly, their private school. $18,000 per year per kid. Had them on my premium health insurance, paid for braces and therapy. Their bio dad lived across the country, saw them maybe twice a year, paid minimal support. But I was the one there every single day building what I thought was our family. Two weeks ago, everything changed. We were discussing holiday plans and I mentioned taking the kids to see my parents like we'd done every year. Michelle stopped me cold. We need to set some boundaries. The kid kids are feeling confused about your role. You're not their dad. You're mom's boyfriend. They have a dad. The words hit like a punch. The dad they see twice a year. I asked, that doesn't matter. My kids don't see you as their father, except it you're overstepping. Five years of being their father figure and suddenly I was overstepping. So what am I to them? She rolled her eyes. You're my partner who lives here, but you need to stop trying to parent them. See, in the private school, I'm paying for You agreed to help with their education when I thought I was building a family, not when I'm just Mom's boyfriend who needs to know his place. She actually rolled her eyes at me. Don't be dramatic. But I wasn't being dramatic. I was finally seeing clearly. I went to my home office and made three calls. First. First HR to remove both kids from my health insurance. Second, the private school to cancel spring semester tuition. Third, my old apartment manager who still had a unit available. Within three hours, I'd systematically undone five years of financial support. That evening at dinner, I acted completely normal, helped with homework like nothing had changed. Michelle seemed pleased I'd accepted my place. Monday morning, the first domino fell. Michelle got an email from school. Spring tuition was due, 36,000 total. The automatic payment from my account had been cancelled. Her texts flooded in frantically. What did you do? You can't do this to the kid.

In my family, there was one rule. I needed my twin's permission to seek medical help. I was watching Vanessa practice her birthday speech when my lungs seized up. I reached for my inhaler on the coffee table, but mom snatched it away. Vanessa, does Ellie need this? My twin didn't even look up from her phone. She used it at lunch. She fine. You heard your sister. Mom dropped my inhaler in her purse. No attention seeking today. It's Vanessa's sweet 16th. The rule had been in place since we were 12. The day I faked pneumonia during Vanessa's ballet recital. I hadn't faked it, but Vanessa said I had, so that became the truth. From then on, every headache, every fever, every asthma attack had to be verified by the golden twin. Can't breathe. The wheeze was starting. That whistling sound my doctor called your body's alarm bell. Ellie! Dad's voice boomed from the door way. What do we do when you claim you're sick? I knew the script. Ask Vanessa first. And what did Vanessa say? Vanessa finally looked up, annoyed. I said, she's fine. Gosh, Ellie, do you have to make my day about you? My chest was tightening like someone was sitting on it. Spread out like sucking air through a coffee stirrer. Please! I gasped. Need hospital, mom! Vanessa whined. She's doing it again. Make her stop! Mom rushed to comfort Vanessa. Don't worry, Sweetie! Ellie, go to your room if you're going to act like this. The modelling scout will be here soon. I tried to stand, but had to grip the couch. My fingernails were starting to tinge blue. Look! I held up my hands. Vanessa laughed. She probably painted them blue. Remember when she faked passing out at my recital? I hadn't faked it. I had an asthma attack. But Vanessa told everyone I was jealous. So my parents refused to leave her performance. The doorbell rang. Party guests started to arrive. Ellie, disappear! Dad ordered. Vanessa's modelling scout is coming. We don't need you wheezing in the background. I couldn't move. My lungs were working overtime through my shirt. Every breath was a battle I was losing. Mom, please! I need hospital! Vanessa! Mom called out sweetly, your sister's asking for the hospital. What do you think, Vanessa? She stood directly in front of me, blocking my parents view for a second. I saw something flicker in her eyes. She's faking! Vanessa announced loudly. She's just mad Ted's coming. Ted? My childhood friend who Vanessa stole just because she could. I knew it! Mom shouted, Ellie, stop this immediately! That's when I started coughing blood. Vanessa's best friend, Jenny walked in and froze. Oh my gosh! What's wrong with Ellie? Nothing, Vanessa said quickly. She's being dramatic, Vanessa. She's coughing blood! No, they're not! Vanessa stepped in front of me again. Everything's perfect. Go help with decorations. But Jenny was Premed. She pushed past Vanessa and grabbed my wrist. Her pulse is racing. This is a medical emergency. We don't do medical emergencies without Vanessa's approval. Dad said like it was totally normal. House rules. What? Jenny looked horrified. Vanessa knows Ellie best, mom explained. She can tell when Ellie's really sick. Versus performing. Performing? Jenny was already dialling 9 1 1. She's in respiratory failure. Give me that phone!

And it doesn't matter. Like, bro, real friends don't need to be in the same classroom or even the same postcode to stay tight. You could be across the city in a different uniform learning completely different subjects, but somehow the bond never fades. Everyone else is like, oh, if you don't go to the same school, you'll drift apart. Nah, bro, not us. I could be sitting in math class stressed out over equations I'll never use in life, and you're across town doing science experiments and we're still texting dumb memes like we saw each other five minutes ago. And when we do link up on the weekend, it's like we never left. No awkward vibes, no weird energy, just straight vibes, bro. We might not be in the same school, but we've got the same mindset, same humor, same jokes, same energy. And the best part, when you meet their school friends and suddenly you feel famous, like, oh, you're that friend they always talk about, yeah, that's me. I don't even go here, but I run this friendship. So if you've got a friend that's in another school but still feels closer than anyone in your class, appreciate that. That's real friendship. Forget proximity. It's about loyalty.

Within a week, his entire family moved three states away, ghosted me, blocked me, vanished like a coward in a Letterman jacket. But I wasn't going to be a statistic. My parents were furious, but weirdly supportive. They helped me finish high school online, and I gave birth to my son, Tommy, over Christmas break with Jingle Bells playing in the background. Cute, right? Tommy and I basically grew up together. I worked three jobs while getting my nursing degree. Mom watched him when she could. We ate so much ramen that he thought it was a food group. We lived in a tiny shoebox apartment with a couch I bought off Craigslist for $15 and dreams duct taped together. But it worked. By the time Tommy was 10, I was a pediatric ICU nurse, and he was this funny, smart, ridiculous little human who made life fun even on two hours of sleep. Then I met Daniel. Daniel's a pediatric surgeon. Smart, kind. Didn't blink when I told him I had a ten year old. On our third date, Tommy had a cold, and Daniel brought over soup and comic books. I think I fell in love. Right then, two years later, we got married and Daniel adopted Tommy. Tommy calls him dad like he Was born to. Because, honestly, he kind of was. We had twin girls three years ago, and Tommy is the sweetest big brother. Straight A student. Star pitcher for his high school, and I mean, star college. Scouts come to see him. Then last month, his team made it to the state championships. I was screaming my lungs out from the bleachers, phone in hand, filming every pitch like a full blown stage mom. That's when I saw Jake. Same face, just older. He was staring at Tommy like he was.

I stared in shock. What house? I never received anything. Grandfather slowly turned to my parents. Their faces went completely pale. Dad's wine glass froze halfway to his lips, trembling in his grip. Grandpa, I think you're confused, I said gently, worried about his memory. You never gave me a house. He frowned deeply and pulled out his phone, scrolling through photos with shaky fingers. The yellow Victorian on Oak Street, three bedrooms, wrap around porch, that beautiful stained glass window. I bought it cash and put it in your name for your 21st birthday. My heart stopped beating. I knew that house. I've been living there for the past two years, religiously paying one two hundred dollars every month to Riverside Property Management, sometimes working double shifts just to make rent on time. Wait, I whispered, my hands starting to shake uncontrollably. I know that house. I live there, but I'm a tenant. Grandpa's bushy eyebrows shot up in confusion. Tenant Emma, you own that house? I have the deed right here in my coat. He pulled out a thick Manila folder from his coat pocket and spread the papers across our Christmas table, knocking over the salt shaker and sending mom I'm carefully arranged centerpiece sliding. There it was in black and white. My full name on the property deed dated exactly two years and three Months ago, I turned to my parents, realization hitting me like a freight train loaded with betrayal. You've been collecting rent from me for my own house. The silence was absolutely deafening. Mom's fork clattered to her plate and I could hear the grandfather clock ticking in the hallway. We can explain this, dad started. His voice barely above a whisper. Explain what I shouted. Standing so fast, my chair fell backward and crashed into the wall. That you've been my landlord this entire time. That every month I've been handing you twelve hundred dollars of my hard earned money. Mom started crying, black mascara running down her carefully made up cheeks and ugly streets. We were saving the money for you, sweetheart, building you a nest egg for the future. Saving it where I demanded. My voice cracking with emotion and rage. Dad couldn't meet my eyes. He stared at his untouched Turkey and mashed potatoes like they held all the answers to his betrayal. We used it to pay off our credit cards and the boat loan and some other debts.

We had this kid in our school named Derek who barely spoke a word, quiet, hoodie up every day, sat alone at lunch, never raised his hand. If you didn't have a class with him, you probably wouldn't even know he existed. But those of us who shared a schedule knew the guy was scary smart, especially at math. He was the kind of kid whose homework got passed around before tests. More than once. A teacher used his assignments as the grading key. Still, he stayed invisible, never bragged, never joined any clubs, never even looked up from his desk unless called on. Then came AP calculus. Our teacher, Mister Hoffman, was infamous. He'd randomly call on students during lectures and mock anyone who didn't have the answer immediately. Not light teasing either, full on public humiliation. He once made a guy cry during a pop quiz review. It was a cold Tuesday morning when it happened. Mister Hoffman was in rare form, tearing through problems on the board, peppering the class with questions like he was trying to thin the herd. Then he turned and called on Derek. Derek, he said, tapping the chalk on the blackboard, let's see you solve this one. He wrote out this monster equation, long, dense, intimidating, just to look at. Everyone turned in their seats. You could feel the room lock into silence. Derek didn't flinch. He stood up, walked slowly to the Board and just stared at it. No twitch, no awkward fidgeting, just calm. Then he reached for the chalk, but instead of solving it, he erased the equation completely and wrote something different. A new equation, same topic, but cleaner, tighter, like it had been debugged by a machine. Then quietly he said, the original problem can't be solved. The equation doesn't make sense in this context. Mister Hoffman froze. Derek turned slightly. You're asking for a real solution, but the function only crosses the axis in imaginary space. It's undefined.

I have a suggestion, he said. Buy the house outright. Put it in your name. Let them live there, but set clear terms. They repay $250,000 in five years or the house stays yours. Three days later, I returned with Daniel and a contract. I will buy this house. You can live here as tenants. To regain ownership, you must repay $250,000 within five years. Emily, I turned to her. You get nothing. Silence. My mother burst into tears. Emily shrieked, are you insane? Making mom and dad pay to live in their own home? I stood up, grabbing the contract. Alright, then forget it. Wait. My father's voice was urgent. They accepted. Two weeks later, the house was legally mine. Then Emily struck back. She posted on Facebook with an old photo of Noah and me. Heartbreaking to have a sister with no shame, a single mother abandoned by her husband, now exploiting our parents for profit. She forced them to sign over the house and kicked me out. She's always been a leech. Hundreds of comments flooded in from people who knew nothing about the truth. But Emily had made a fatal mistake. She dragged my son into this. I called Daniel immediately. Send a legal notice. I want her out of my house in two days. That afternoon, we arrived at the house. Daniel held up documents. Emily Thompson, under property ownership terms, you no longer have the right to reside here. You have 48 hours to vacate. Emily laughed. You're serious? Do I look like I'm joking? She spat. You and your little bastard are just leeches. A pathetic woman abandoned by her husband, pretending to be strong, but still just a miserable failure. Smack. I slapped her across the face. The sound echoed through the room. You can insult me all you want, Emily, but if you ever drag my son into this again, I promise it won't just be a slap. My parents stood frozen silent. Daniel placed the eviction notice in front of her. Sign this or expect a court summons. Emily turned to our parents. Mom, dad, you can't let her do this. They lowered their heads silent. He grabbed the pen, signed with such force it nearly tore the paper and stormed out. You'll pay for this, I shrugged. Try me. The door slammed shut. Full story on the channel linked below.

My wife thinks I'm racist, but she doesn't get it. We're both white. And when we were going through baby names, I kept crossing off every name that sounded even remotely black. Damon? No. Malik? Hell, no. Even names like Jordan or Tyler got vetoed because I'd seen too many black kids with those names at work. My wife kept asking why, and I finally told her the truth. I work in HR. At a midsize company, and I see what happens to resumes. I'm not proud of it, but it's real. Names like Desean or Jamal get tossed in the trash before anyone even reads past the header. I've watched my boss do it right in front of me. He'll glance at a name, make some comment about cultural fit and move on to the next resume. So when our son was born, we named him Michael. Safe, White, boring as hell, but it would open doors for him that might stay closed otherwise. Fast forward eight years and Michael's in third grade. He's got this best friend named Jamal, whose mom, Lisa, works as a nurse. Sweetest kid you've ever met. Smart as a whip. And they're inseparable. Michael asks if Jamal can come over for his birthday party. Of course, I say yes. When Lisa drops Jamal off, she mentions she's been looking for work closer to home. Her current hospital is An hour away, and with gas prices, it's killing her budget. I tell her we're actually hiring for a nurse position at my company's health clinic. She lights up, asks if I can put in a good word. I say absolutely, knowing damn well what's going to happen when her resume hits my boss's desk. Monday morning, I'm in the break room when my boss walks in with a stack of resumes. He starts going through them, and I see Lisa's on top. Her name is Lisa Washington, not obviously black, but her address is in a predominantly black neighborhood. He glances at it, and I watch his face change. Experience looks good, he mutters, but I don't think she'd be a good fit for our patients. I know exactly what that means. Our patients are mostly older white folks from the suburbs. Same bullshit excuse he always uses. But here's where it gets interesting. Later that day, Michael calls me at.

My wife, Stephanie, waited until we were eating dessert at Cassie and Paul's house to drop this on me. We should swap partners every Thursday, she said. And I literally watched her put her hand on Paul's thigh under the table. I saw it. Cassie saw it, too, and her face went blank. What? I asked? Because I honestly thought I heard her wrong. Partner swapping? We date each other's spouses. She said it like she was talking about switching cars for the weekend. Paul kept staring at his plate and wouldn't make eye contact with me. It's already decided, Stephanie said. Thursday nights, you take Cassie out, Paul takes me. I felt my chest get tight. When did they decide this without me? This is insane, I told her. Then she leaned in close and whispered. Room 2:37 last Tuesday when you were at work. Whole body went numb. She was telling me she'd already cheated and now wanted my permission to keep doing it. So are you in or not? She asked louder. I looked at Cassie and she was crying without making any sound. Fine, I said, let's swap partners. Stephanie smiled like she just won something. But then I noticed Cassie had stopped crying completely. That should have told me something right there. When the first date night came around, Stephanie spent forever getting ready. Put on this red dress. I've never seen before that she'd been hiding in our closet. Paul's car was already running in our driveway when I left. I brought Cassie white roses because I remembered she mentioned liking them once. Hands shook when she took them. Paul never. She started, then stopped at dinner. She pushed her food around and barely ate anything. You okay? I asked. Paul's been different, she said quietly, for months, even before. Then she stopped talking again. I reached over and touched her hand before. What? Nothing. Forget I said anything. But then her phone lit up with Stephanie's name and she turned it face down. Immediately, I got home that night, Stephanie was already there. Her hair was all messed up and her lipstick was smeared on the wrong side of her mouth. How was Cassie? Good. How was Paul? Then she started telling me everything they did, the hotel room, the balcony, what they did against the wall. She kept getting louder with each detail. Stop, I told her. Why? Don't you wanna know? No. Her face got all twisted up. Well, I'm telling you anyway. She kept going with more details while I pulled out my phone and texted Cassie, thank you for a lovely evening. Stephanie saw my screen and threw her wine glass at the wall. It shattered everywhere and I just stood there looking at her. The next week, I had to pick Cassie up because her car broke down out of nowhere. Paul Was supposed to drive me, she said, looking confused.

She had way too much wine. Can I tell you something? She asked, and her eyes looked glassy. Tuesday afternoons. That's when it started. My heart started racing. What started? She covered her mouth with her hand. Nothing. Forget it. But Tuesday was when Stephanie had mentioned the hotel and we both knew what she meant. Then we had to go to Stephanie's parents house for dinner. Stephanie showed up late and I could smell Paul's Cologne all over her clothes. Her mom noticed it right away and her face changed. Is that men's Cologne? The whole table went quiet. We're sharing partners with Cassie and Paul, I said. Every week her dad dropped his fork and it made this loud sound. Sharing? Taking turns dating each other's spouses. Stephanie's idea. Her mom stood up from the table in my house, she said, and her voice was shaking. Stephanie tried to explain, but everyone had already smelled the Cologne and knew what was happening. That night Cassie called me. I know about Tuesday afternoons. I felt sick to my stomach about them. I followed Paul once four months ago to the hotel. She sounded drunk. I saw everything. By week five, everything fell apart. It was Cassie's birthday and I threw her a surprise party. I made a video of all her artwork and gave the speech about how talented and kind she was. Paul forgot it was her birthday completely. I watched Stephanie watch Cassie Cry happy tears and hold on to me like she didn't want to let go. That one night, Stephanie came home from Paul's and started telling me what they did in graphic detail again. Stop. I don't want to hear it. She got mad. But I'm telling you everything. I didn't ask. Then she demanded to know what Cassie and I did together. We talked. I told her. Talked. He's going through a lot. Paul's been distant for months. I watched Stephanie's face change when she realized her best friend was falling for me while she was throwing away our marriage for physical intimacy. The next morning, Stephanie was shaking. We're stopping this immediately. I showed her my phone with all these screenshots Cassie had sent me. Four months of text messages between Stephanie and Paul, including ones from before she ever mentioned swapping. Cassie's known the whole time. I told her she wanted to see if you'd confess. Stephanie's face went completely white. She's filing for divorce. I am, too.

She suddenly became a food critic. My girlfriend insisted I cook for her roommate's birthday dinner at our apartment. I been planning the menu all week, but she kept reminding me not to go overboard with the fancy stuff because Lexi preferred simple food. The second I started prepping in the kitchen, setting up my knees on place and heating the cast iron, my girlfriend grabbed her phone and sprawled on the couch. I'm ordering sushi for myself, she announced without looking up. Your food's always too heavy. I watched her scroll through TikTok while I worked on the carbonara from scratch, making fresh pasta and whisking eggs with Ecarina Romano. Smells incredible in here, said a voice from the doorway. Lexi had come home early from work, dark hair pulled back, still in her office clothes, the type who actually appreciated effort when she saw it. Oh, my god, she said, moving closer to the stove. Are you making pasta from scratch? She actually watched me work, not the polite glance people usually give. I didn't know guys our age even knew how to cook like this. My ex could barely make cereal. We started talking about food. While I finished the dish. She traveled through Italy last summer, Rome, Florence, Bologna, real interest, asking about techniques and ingredients. Have you always cook like this? Lexi asked, leaning against the counter. I'd love to learn. Sometime your girlfriend is so lucky. My chest tightened. My girl girlfriend had never once asked to learn anything I made, not once in two years of dating. I'd even catered her office party last month and she'd introduced the food as something we picked up. Does she eat my food? I asked. Lexi's expression shifted slightly. Well, she mentioned you cook a lot, she paused. Actually, now that I think about it, I've never seen her eat anything you've made. She's always getting take out when we hang out. That hit harder than expected. I cooked five nights a week and ate most meals alone. Lexi must have seen something in my face because she stepped closer. That's her loss. This looks restaurant quality. It's nothing special, I said. Plating the carbonara from the living room, I caught my girlfriend glancing over while pretending to watch Netflix. Her eyes narrowed slightly seeing Lexi and me talking. Lexi noticed too and smiled. Well, well, looks like someone finally noticed you exist. My girlfriend looked away, quickly turning the volume up on the TV. You know what, Lexi said? Taking a bite of the pasta. Her eyes literally closed. This is the best thing I've eaten in months. She looked directly at my girlfriend. Girl, if you don't marry him, I will. This is insane. She took another bite, then raised her voice just enough to carry. Seriously, I would wife you up just for this carbonara alone. Do you cater Because I have single friends. Who would pay good money to date a guy who cooks like this? The effect was instantaneous. My girlfriend appeared in the kitchen faster than I'd ever seen her move. Her face flushed red. Since when are you two so friendly? She demanded, positioning herself between Lexi and me. Lexi, shrug.

But I turn the tables with a surprise of my own. His reaction is priceless. I was turning 18 and honestly, I wasn't expecting much. My brother got a car for his 18th birthday. Not just any car. A brand new Jeep with a bow on top. My sister got a trip to Paris with two of her friends when she turned eighteen. Me dad pulled me aside exactly one week before my birthday and said, don't expect anything special this year. Money is tight. You know how it is. But I knew exactly how it was. Money wasn't tight. It was never tight when it came to them. Growing up, I always felt invisible in my own house. My brother was the golden child. Star quarterback, straight A's. Everyone's favorite. My sister was the baby, the princess who could do no wrong. And me? I was just there, taking up space. I remember being 12 and winning a regional science fair. I came home so excited to tell everyone my brother had just scored a touchdown at practice same day. Guess which one got celebrated at dinner? Hint it wasn't the science fair. When I was 15, I made honor roll for the first time. I left the certificate on the kitchen counter, hoping someone would notice. Three days later, I found it under a pile of my sister's cheerleading flyers. No! No one Had said a word. So when dad gave me that warning about my birthday, something inside me shifted. I wasn't hurt anymore. I was done. I've been working at a local grocery store since I was 16. Every paycheck, I put away as much as I could. I told my parents the money was for college expenses, which wasn't exactly a lie. But I had a bigger plan brewing. Six months before my 18th birthday, I'd applied to MIT. I didn't tell anyone. Not my guidance counselor, not my friends, definitely not my family. I wrote the essays late at night in my room. I sent in my test scores, my transcripts. Everything in secret. Three months before my birthday, I got the email. Full academic scholarship, full ride. They wanted me. I stared at that acceptance letter for hours, reading it over and over, making sure it was real. And then I saved it. I didn't tell a soul. I wanted to wait for the perfect moment. My birthday morning arrived. I came downstairs around 9 a M. Mom was making pancakes, but they were my sister's favorite kind. Chocolate chip. My birthday breakfast had always been blueberry, but I guess she forgot. Dad was reading the newspaper. My brother was texting someone, probably his girlfriend. My sister was taking selfies with the pancakes before she even ate them. Morning, I said, sitting down at the table. Oh, happy birthday, sweetie, mom said, not looking up from the stove. Dad glanced at me over his newspaper and gave a single nod. That was it. My brother didn't even acknowledge me. My sister took another selfie. No card on my plate. No small rat gift. Not even a birthday candle and a pancake. Nothing. I ate my breakfast in silence, watching my family completely ignore the fact that I existed. And honestly, I felt nothing. No sadness, no anger. Just calm. Clarity. After breakfast, I cleared my throat. I have something to show you all. My dad lowered his newspaper, slightly annoyed at the interruption. Mom turned around from the dishes. My siblings finally looked up from their phones. I pulled out my laptop and opened it on the kitchen table. The MIT acceptance letter was already on the screen, big and bold and undeniable.

Did you burn your barn down? Yep, the man responded. Why did you do it? It was old and rotten with termites. It was going to fall down, not safe to be kept standing. The man replied, hmm. Have you always burned down old farm buildings? The lawyer asked, yep, I'm a farmer and my daddy was a farmer and he did the same thing before me. The lawyer then asked, are you aware that you need a permit to burn debris in this county? The man replied, my family been doing it like that on this farm. We never had no permit. My farm is located in an active agriculture zone and is exempt from needing a permit to burn down debris. It was at this moment I turned to look at the prosecution's face and their lawyer was damn near going pale. This was already enough to get the man off the hook, but he wasn't done. His lawyer continued, if all of that is true, why, why didn't you tell any of this to the police? The man then cleared his throat. They didn't ask me anything until after they put handcuffs on me and took me to the police station. They told me anything I said would be used against me and said I had the right to remain silent. And then some old idiot lawyer guy came in and said I was going To prison for insurance fraud. I remember I heard people say don't talk to anyone but your lawyer, and so I didn't. The lawyer then asked, do you file an insurance claim? What for? The man responded, the barn wasn't worth anything in that state and I moved all the stuff out beforehand. The prosecution's lawyer had now buried his face in his hands, but still, the man wasn't done. His lawyer asked him, you could have avoided all of this if you had just said that. But you told me you actually wanted your day in court. Why did you want that? Well, because the man said, they came on my land, arrested me without telling me what for, told me later it was for arson and insurance fraud, and put that in the newspapers. All my friends, relatives and neighbors know about this. They made me look dishonest. I want to make sure everyone knows the real facts and knows I'm not a dishonest man. I figured this was a better way of doing that than just getting them to drop it. Defense rests. The case ended up being dropped within the next 20 minutes.

When I showed them the text my fiance sent about my trashy acrylics. I was getting my nails done for my engagement photos the next day. Nothing too crazy, just some almond shaped acrylics with a simple pink and white design. The nail tech, Anna, was putting on the final coat when my phone buzzed. It was a text from my fiance, Kevin. Can you please get normal nails? Those long fake ones look so trashy. My mom's gonna be in the photos and she already thinks you're not classy enough for our family. Just keep it simple so you don't embarrass me. I stared at my phone for like 10 seconds. The whole salon was buzzing with chatter and music, but I felt like everything just stopped. Anna noticed me freeze up and asked if everything was okay. I didn't know what to say, so I just showed her the text. She read it and her face went from confused to angry real quick. Then she did something I wasn't expecting. She turned to the other nail techs and said loudly, hey girls, look at this. Within seconds, I had like six women huddled around my chair, all reading Kevin's message over each other's shoulders. The salon went dead silent. Even the music seemed quieter. One of the older ladies getting a pedicure leaned over and asked what was wrong. Anna just held up my phone and read the text out. Loud to the entire salon. Can you please get normal nails? Those long fake ones look so trashy. I've never heard a room full of women get so mad so fast. This lady named Carmen, who is getting her eyebrows done, started going off about how no man should ever talk to his woman like that. The girl next to me was like, honey, those nails are gorgeous. There's nothing trashy about them. Even the receptionist came over from the front desk. But then Anna did something that changed everything. He looked at me and said, you know what? We're gonna make these nails even better. Before I could say anything, she started adding tiny diamonds to each nail. Then she called over her coworker, Maria, who started painting these intricate little roses on my ring finger. The whole salon turned into like a mission. Carmen offered to pay for the extra designs. The pedicure lady started giving me advice about red flag.

I couldn't move, couldn't speak. Two years later, I bought the company my brother worked for and fired him myself. I woke up from spinal surgery unable to feel anything below my chest. The doctor said I'd walk again in six months. My girlfriend Maya, promised she'd be there every step of the way. She lasted three weeks. Take three. I'm lying in our bed when I hear them. My brother Devon's voice, then hers, laughing. The bedroom door was cracked open just enough. I couldn't yell, couldn't move. Couldn't even reach my phone on the nightstand. Had to lie there and listen to them in our kitchen. He's asleep, Maya whispered. We're fine. Devon laughed, even if he wasn't. What's he gonna do, chase us? They both laughed at that. My own brother. I tried to make a sound. Anything. But my throat was still raw from the breathing tube. Nothing came out except a weak rasp that neither of them I heard. That's when I realized how truly helpless I was. They didn't even try to hide it. After that first time, he'd come over to help with my physical therapy three times a week. While she made dinner, I'd watch them kiss in the kitchen. Reflection from my hospital bed set up in the living room. Devon would adjust my pillows, check my IV fluids, then wink at Maya when he thought I Wasn't looking. Sometimes he'd sit on the edge of my bed and talk about his new promotion at the tech startup he worked for. How he was finally making six figures. How he'd always been the successful one in the family. You understand, right, bro? He'd. Hey, patting my shoulder, Maya needs someone who can actually take care of her. I'd blink once for yes, twice for no. Our system. I blink twice every single time. He just smile. You'll understand eventually. The day I could finally move my fingers, I didn't tell anyone I practiced in secret when they thought I was sleeping. Two weeks later, I could grip things. A month after that, I took my first steps, holding onto the bed frame at 3 a m.

I was 13 when my mother got engaged to Brandon. Dad had been convicted for manslaughter five months ago. He someone at the bar, but he wasn't even drinking. I was there with him. He went into the bathroom, then came out minutes later looking panicked and covered in blood. He shouted for someone to call the police and they arrived quickly. But then without saying much, they put him in handcuffs and took him away. The next time I saw him was behind bars. It never made much sense, though. Dad never had a violent bone in his body. He swore he didn't do it. And the way mom acted after his conviction made me even more suspicious. She brought home Brandon instantly. On day one. She said he was my new dad since the other one was clearly a monster, and told me that my dad was a killer who I needed to distance from for my own safety. I wasn't sure what to believe at first, but when five months later my mom announced to me that they were engaged and I needed to start calling Brandon Daddy, I became quite convinced of Dad's innocence. Around this time is also when it started. Brandon got comfortable. He began staring at me while eating slowly, saying things like, you're growing up. So fast, becoming such a pretty young woman. The worst part was my mom thought it was sweet. Even when I told my mom for the first time that Brandon made my skin crawl, she told me I was dramatic. She must have told him what I said, though, because that night while she slept, Brandon came into my room and he grabbed my wrist hard enough to leave marks and said, you know what happens to naughty girls who snitch. I was terrified, but I knew I couldn't trust my mom by telling her, so I kept it a secret. I also started keeping a different secret around this time. I started writing letters to dad. I'd hide them between my textbook pages and mail them from my friend's house. After school. Dad would write back through the prison email system to an account I created without mom knowing. Things got really bad one specific Thursday, though. I came home from school one day to find out mom had changed my last name on all school records to Brandon's without telling me. You'll thank me when you're older, she said. That night, Brandon came into my room to celebrate being a real family now and sat on my bed. He put his hand on my thigh and said, I should be grateful to have a dad who cares. I pushed him off and locked myself in the bathroom until he left. I remember writing to dad about that incident. The letter I got back from him was on real paper this time, and parts of it were damp and see through, almost as if he had cried while writing it. That almost broke me. But luckily, there was one thing I looked forward to, the chance to see him. His birthday was coming up and I remember enthusiastically asking mom if I could visit him. I told her I knew she didn't like him.

I know that sounds weird coming from a white girl, but hear me out. This whole thing started about three years ago when I was living in Atlanta for my internship. My usual salon back home was, like, four hours away, and I was desperate for a trim because my hair looked like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. My roommate Keisha, was getting ready to head out to her salon and saw me struggling with my massive curls in the bathroom mirror. She just laughed and said, girl, come with me. My stylist will sort you out. I was hesitant because I'd never been to a black salon before, but honestly, my hair was so bad, I would have tried anything. Walking into that salon was like entering a whole different world. The energy was incredible. Everyone was talking, laughing, music playing, kids running around while their moms got their hair done. It felt alive in a way that the quiet, sterile salons I was used to never did. The stylist, Miss Janet, took one look at my hair and shook her head, baby, who's been cutting your hair? Because they need to stop. She started running her fingers through it, asking me about my routine, what products I used, how I dried it. Nobody had ever asked me those questions before. They just wet it, cut it, and send me on my way. Miss Janet spent two hours on my hair. Two hours. He deep conditioned it, trimmed each curl individually, showed me how to scrunch it properly, and sent me home with specific instructions about what products to use and how often to wash it. My hair looked better than it ever had in my entire life. But here's the thing that really got me. She charged me $40. 40. The salon back home charged

That afternoon, I tried joining him on the track during pe, thinking we could maybe jog and chat together. But the moment he saw me coming, he just sprinted away like I was chasing him down with a machete. For the next few days, it went on like that between us. But here's the thing, the more I annoyed him, the more I started noticing small changes. How on the fourth day of me walking home behind him, he slowed down just enough that I could actually keep up. And when I sat across from him at lunch, he stayed and ate with his headphones in while I rambled about my day. Two weeks in, he finally cracked. When I tripped and fell onto the track, he stopped and bent down to carry me to the side of the grass and asked, what do you want from me? I felt my heart race hearing his voice. I just want to be friends with you, I said simply. He stared at me before letting out a sad laugh. You're crazy, maybe, I shrugged, but you're stuck with me now. Then something crazy happened after that. Whenever I'd walk over to him, he pulled down his headphones and actually chat with me. And slowly I started seeing glimpses of the old Ian The one who'd make sarcastic comments that'd make me laugh so hard I'd snort. The one who'd hold the door open with, without thinking about it. The one whose smile melted everyone in the room. He even started changing at school, talking to others without that edge in his voice. And I felt proud thinking I actually managed to pull him from the dark place like he once did for me. But then he saw it. We were hanging out at the bookstore when Ian reached into my bag for a pen and froze. His jaw tightened as he slowly pulled out the notebook. Why do you have this? He asked quietly. My mouth went dry. I was going to give it back, but he stood up abruptly, the chair scraping loud against the floor. You read it, didn't you? That's why you've been doing all this. I thought you cared, but this was all just some pity party to you. I do care. I stood up, too. My voice louder than I meant it to be. It's started with a notebook, but that's not why I stayed. I took a deep breath. I stayed because I fell in love with you. The words hung in the air between us. His eyes widened, anger melting. He sank back into the chair, the notebook still in his hands. This isn't my notebook. And what he said next made everything click into place. The reason why he became closed off and honestly, It broke my heart more than his answer to my confession.

I was born completely deaf and got my first cochlear implant when I turned 16. My parents had been pushing for it since I was little, but I kept refusing because I was perfectly happy in my silent world. The day they activated my implant was like stepping into an alien universe. Suddenly everything had sound, and I mean everything. The audiologist warned me it would be overwhelming, but nothing could have prepared me for the chaos. The first shot came when I walked to the bathroom after my appointment. I sat down to pee and heard this loud rushing water sound. I jumped up thinking something was broken. My mom had to explain through tears of laughter that peeing makes noise. For 16 years, I thought it was completely silent. But that was just the beginning of my sound discoveries. Walking became this weird symphony. Every footstep made noise on different surfaces, carpet with soft thumps, hardwood with sharp clicks. And don't get me started, on gravel. I spent 20 minutes just walking back and forth on our driveway, amazed that each step sounded like tiny explosions. Eating was absolutely disgusting. I had no idea chewing was so loud and gross. That first dinner, I kept asking my family if they could hear my mouth making all these wet, crunching sounds. They said yes, but you just Learned to ignore it. How do hearing people eat without being grossed out constantly? My cat Oliver became this whole different creature. Apparently, he'd been meowing at me for years and I never knew. The first time I heard him, I thought there was a baby crying somewhere. He also purrs, which sounds like a tiny motor running. Plus, his footsteps on hardwood sound like little tap dancers. The biggest shock came during my first night sleeping with the implant. I kept hearing this rhythmic thumping sound that scared me. I woke up my parents thinking someone was in the house. Dad checked everywhere before realising I was hearing my own heartbeat through the pillow. Nobody told me hearts make noise. School became a nightmare of new sounds. Pencils scratching on paper sounded like nails on chalkboards. Kids clicking pens drove me absolutely crazy. The worst was when people cracked their knuckles. I literally screamed the first time my friend Jake did it, thinking he broke something. But the most embarrassing discovery happened during lunch. I was eating an apple when this girl named Tessa sitting nearby started laughing. I asked what was funny and she said I was eating really loudly. Apparently biting and chewing apples sounds like someone stomping on bubble wrap. I've been crunching away completely unaware that everyone could hear me. The weirdest thing was learning that some of my habits were actually really annoying. I used to tap my fingers on desks when I was thinking. Turns out that Makes noise and had been driving my teachers crazy for years. They just never said anything because they knew I couldn't hear it.

When I found out my classmate plan to take his own life, I decided to help him in the way everyone warned me not to. Ian used to be the guy everyone wanted to hang out with, the type to help freshman with algebra, then turn around and throw spirals with the seniors. The type to sit with the quiet kids because he never wanted anyone to be alone. He never cared that no one asked how he was doing. He just focused on making others happy. But last year, he changed abruptly. He stopped smiling, started getting into fights over nothing. So like everyone else, I kept my distance until he left his notebook in Class 1 Thursday afternoon. I was about to hand it over to the teacher when it fell open. The moment my eyes read what was on the page, it was too late. The handwriting was messy and desperate and the small wrinkled spots were clearly tear stains. It was the words that made my hands shake uncontrollably. I can't do this anymore. Everything hurts too much. I'm so sorry. I felt my breath stuck in my throat. There were pages and pages talking about giving up, about how it'd be easier if everything just stopped. And I wasn't sure what to do. So I went to my friends for Help. My best friend Rica closed the notebook shut and shook her head at me. Look, I know this is bad, but please don't get involved with him. He literally got suspended last semester when he fought one of his old friends and you're practically a stranger to him, she advised. But Ian helped me once. Remember three years ago when I had a panic attack during my presentation? He sat down with me in the hallway and stayed with me until I was done crying. I insist. Ricca let out a sigh while my other friend Maddie forced to smile. We know you'll do it anyway. Just promise you'll walk away if things go south. Okay? I immediately found Ian after school walking toward the parking lot with his hood up and headphones. I chased after him, basically jogging just to keep up. Hey, wait up, let's walk home together. He glanced down at me, but when I grinned at him, he gave an annoyed look and walked faster towards his house. I chased after him anyway, rambling about the weather and homework and literally anything that came to mind. When he turned on his street, I stopped and waved and yelled, see you tomorrow as loud as I could, but he never responded. The next day at lunch, I sat down across from him with my tray and smiled. He stared at me for exactly three seconds before.

They didn't come to my middle school graduation, didn't come to my high school graduation. My aunt was there for everything, cheering louder than any parent in that auditorium. When I left for college at 18, my parents didn't help with tuition, didn't help me move into my dorm. I don't think they even knew which university I attended. My aunt covered everything. Last year, Grandpa got sick, really sick. He kept asking to see his sons. My dad and uncles, aunt called them repeatedly, begging them to visit. None of them came. My aunt moved into his farmhouse to take care of him in his final months. I drove out every weekend to help. When Grandpa died, my dad and uncle suddenly appeared at the funeral, then at the lawyer's office for the will reading. Grandpa left everything to my aunt, his 150 acre farm, the farmhouse and $1 million in cash. The rest went to charity. My dad's face went white. Three weeks later, my aunt called me over. She handed me a check for the full million, said Grandpa would have wanted me to have it, that I'd spent more time with him than any of his actual sons. She told me to start the business I'd always dreamed about. I cried, not because of the money, but because someone actually cared about my dreams. Word got out fast. Within days, my phone started blowing up. Dad suddenly remembered my number. Hey, buddy, how's School. We should catch up. Mom left voicemails about how much she missed me, how proud she was of me going to college. Yesterday, dad showed up at my dorm. I have no idea how he got my address. Probably called my aunt. He stood there smiling, saying how proud he was that I was graduating this year. Asked why I never visited his house anymore. I asked him when he last called me. He went quiet, then laughed it off. You're still mad about the divorce? Come on. That was years ago. We both love you. Your mom misses you. Let me drive you home for dinner. I told him the only family I have is my aunt, that he abandoned me 9 years ago and I wasn't stupid enough have to fall for this. I know why you're here. That million brought you back, right? He put his hands up, said he had no ulterior motives, just wanted to apologize and have me back in his life. Mentioned he heard my graduation was coming up, wanted to make sure he got an invitation this time. That same night, mom left another voicemail, said she and dad couldn't afford college themselves, so they always dreamed I'd go. She's so excited I'm graduating, wants to be there for my big day. They think I'm stupid. They think 9 years of silence can be erased with a few phone calls and fake tears. My graduation is in two weeks. I'm not Inviting either of them.

After her family voted me out, I just nodded. The next morning, their own lawyer called her, his voice shaking. The vote, it didn't remove him. It just triggered Article 11, section B. God help us all. So this happened last week, and I'm still processing everything. I'm 54. Built my tech company from nothing. Literally started in my garage with a broken laptop and a dream. Fast forward 28 years, and we're worth $180 million. Along the way, I married Sarah, 32. Yeah, I know what you're thinking, but she seemed genuine back then. The board meeting started normal enough. Sarah, her brother Kyle, my C F O, and six other executives, most of them Sarah's relatives I'd hired over the years. The kind of people who smile at Thanksgiving, check their inheritance behind your back. Sarah stood up first. We've called this vote because leadership needs fresh direction. Her voice was cold. Kyle nodded like a bobblehead. The others wouldn't even look at me. Then came the vote. One by one, hands went up. My own wife voted against me. Seven to one. I was out. Sarah leaned across the table, her new diamond bracelet catching the light. You're not man enough to fight for the company you built, she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, like she'd practiced it. The room went dead silent. Kyle smirked. Jerry from accounting, the guy Whose student loans I'd paid off. Just stared at his coffee. You know what I did? I nodded once, and I stood up, straighten my jacket, and walked out. No yelling, no drama. Just the sound of my shoes on the floor. Sarah looked confused. She wanted to fight. She wanted me to beg. Instead, she got silence. I walked straight to my office, the one they hadn't touched yet. Behind a fake panel I'd installed 28 years ago was a brown leather binder. Inside was the original company charter, the one from before Sarah got her first

Asked them to show up at noon with decorations and cake. Told them to keep it secret that she thought I was out of town. They ate it up. Her mom was practically crying with joy. Said I was the most thoughtful son in law ever. Even offered to bring her famous potato salad. I left the house at 9 a m. With my suitcase, just like I said I would. Waved goodbye to her from the driveway. She blew me a kiss from the doorway. Already in her silk robe, the one I bought her for Christmas. I drove around the block and park three streets over, right where I could see our driveway. Waited in my car with a coffee and a breakfast sandwich from the Corner Deli. At 10:47 a m, a silver BM W pulled up. Didn't recognize the car, but I recognized his face immediately from the photos on her burner phone. Her project manager from work, the one she'd been texting I miss you, too. At 2 a m, while I slept next to her, I watched him walk up to my front door. Watched her answer in that same silk robe. Watched her pull him inside and close the door. I sat there for another hour, stomach turning, but I waited. Timing had to be perfect. Perfect. At 11:00am, I met her family outside our building. Her mom was holding a custom cake from the expensive bakery. White frosting with pink Flowers that said, happy 32nd birthday, Taylor. Her sister had a bouquet of balloons. Her best friend carried A bag of presents wrapped in gold paper. Everyone was grinning, so excited to surprise her. I had my key ready. Told everyone to be super quiet, that we'd sneak down the hall and really shock her. They were giggling like kids on Christmas morning. Her mom kept adjusting the candles on the cake. We walked in silent. I could hear music playing from the bedroom, her favorite playlist. Her mom was trying not to laugh. Holding that cake with both. With hands. Her sister kept whispering, she's going to freak out. Her friend was recording on her phone. We made our way down the hall. I positioned everyone right outside the bedroom door. Her mom held up the cake. 32 candles flickering. Everyone raised their party horns, fingers on the triggers. I mouthed one, two, three, and threw open the door. The party horns went off at the exact same moment her mom dropped A cake.

I knew something was off when she started working late every Tuesday. At first I believed her. She's always been dedicated to her career. But then the little things started piling up. She'd come home smelling different. Not perfume exactly, but like someone else's laundry detergent. Her phone was suddenly password protected after eight years of marriage. And she started going to the gym at weird hours. Ten PM on a Wednesday. Really? The breaking point was finding the second phone in her gym bag. I was looking for her water bottle to wash it, and there it was. A cheap prepaid phone, still logged into everything. Messages, photos, tell reservations, all of it. Here's what I Learned in that moment. Don't confront immediately. I wanted to scream. I wanted to throw that phone against the wall and demand answers. But something in me said to wait. Document everything first. So I did. For three months, I played The Perfect Husband. I screenshotted every text on that burner phone when she was in the shower. I saved receipts from hotels I'd never been to, restaurants we'd never eaten at. I tracked her late nights on a calendar, built an air tight case and handed it all to a lawyer. My attorney loved me. Said most guys come in with nothing but suspicion. I came in with a legal nuclear weapon. Her birthday rolled around in October. Three months into My silent investigation. I asked what she wanted to do, and she got this strange look on her face. Said she wanted me to go visit my brother for the weekend. Said she just wanted a quiet day at home. Maybe order takeout and watch movies. Didn't want to be reminded she was getting older. I knew that was complete garbage. He loves her birthday. Last year, she had a party with 40 people. That morning, I found champagne hidden in the garage. The expensive kind. $200 a bottle. Two crystal glasses wrapped in tissue paper, tucked behind the paint cans. Candles, too. The fancy ones from that boutique store downtown. She always dragged me to. Something in me snapped. But not in an angry way. In a calculated way. So I called her mom, then her sister, then her best friend from college, the one who was in our wedding. Told them all the same story. I wanted to throw her a surprise.

My 14 year old daughter started asking to sleep over at friends houses every weekend. And I thought it was just normal teenage social stuff. But then I noticed the pattern. Every Monday morning, she'd come home looking absolutely destroyed. Dark circles so deep they looked like bruises. Shoulders hunched, dragging her feet like each step hurt. When I asked about the sleepovers, she'd just mumble, it was fun and disappear into her room. Her math teacher emailed saying she had a panic attack during class when he'd casually asked about her weekend plans. Her violent teacher called to say she'd quit. Just walked out mid lesson without explanation. She lost 10 pounds in just over a month. Her favourite jeans hung loose on her hips. She barely touched breakfast anymore. Started missing Sunday family dinners, events she'd never miss before. Not even when she had the flu. My partner thought I was losing it. She's 14. Lisa, girls have sleepovers. You're being paranoid. But when I was cleaning her room, I found energy drink cans stuffed behind her dresser. Dozens of them. My sweet girl who used to drink nothing but herbal tea. My mom instincts weren't just whispering anymore. They were screaming. I started watching her more carefully. She'd get text on Friday afternoon and her whole body would change. Shoulders would tense up, face would go pale, hands would start trembling as she packed. Always the same overnight bag. But I Noticed something odd. Work gloves sticking out of the side pocket. No more family game nights on Saturdays. No more baking cookies together on Sunday mornings. No more asking me to braid her hair before bed. It was like she was being pulled away from us by some invisible force. One day, I was passing her room when I heard her on the phone. Her voice was different. Scared. Desperate, almost. I know. I know. I'll be there. Her voice cracked. I can't do this every weekend anymore. Please. A pause. No, I understand. I promise I won't tell anyone. Then I heard her crying. Real gut wrenching sobs that made my chest tighten. The next morning at breakfast, I asked casually, which friend's house are you going to tonight, honey? Her spoon clattered into her cereal bowl. Her eyes darted to her phone like it might save her. Just. Just. Marlene's. Her mom already said yes. But I called Marlene's mom last week. Marlene had been at her dad's house in another state for the past month. That's when I really started noticing her phone behaviour. When a specific notification sound played, just two quick beeps, her entire body would go rigid. Then she'd immediately delete whatever she'd seen. Something was very, very wrong with my daughter. I waited until she left for her sleepover that Saturday night. Then I did something I'd sworn I'd never do. I followed her. She didn't walk like a teenager heading to a Fun sleepover. She walked like someone heading to their execution, taking a weird, winding route through the neighborhood, doubling back twice, constantly checking over her shoulder. At one point she stopped completely, stood under a streetlight, and I watched her take deep, shuddering breaths like she was preparing for battle. She pulled out her phone and typed something. Even from my car, I could see her hands shaking as she hit send. The response must have been immediate because her shoulders slumped into defeat. Then she kept walking. What I discovered made my stomach drop to the floor. She didn't go.

I worked at a rage room for three years, seen all kinds of people, angry, ex wives, screaming teenagers, guys who just got fired. But this one guy, he was different. Walks in Tuesday morning around nine, regular jeans, a hoodie, beat up sneakers, maybe early 30s, looked completely normal. Face was just blank, like someone unplugged him from the world. I need your biggest room, he says. How long? I asked. All day if you let me. I explain we do four hour blocks maximum. Eight hours is our limit. He books two sessions back to back, doesn't even ask the price, just slides his credit card across the counter. Then he pulls out a thick stack of, he pays the whole thing in cash instead. He says, I wanna make sure this happens. What are you bringing to destroy, I ask. Killing out the waiver? Nothing, he says. I'll use whatever you have. So I take him to our storage area in the back. We've got tons of donated stuff people drop off. Old furniture, broken TVs, boxes of dishes, electronics, random junk from estate sales, basically whatever people want gone. He starts walking through it slowly touching things, picking stuff up, setting it back down, runs his fingers over an old dining chair, opens drawers in a beat up dresser, holds up a coffee mug, reads the bottom and puts it down. He does this for Maybe 30 minutes. I'm watching him the whole time thinking this guy's either gonna have the best session ever or he's gonna just stand there. Finally he stops in front of this bright yellow plastic toy box, one of those ones with cartoon characters all over it, pulls it out, carries it to the room, doesn't say a word, closes the door behind him. I go to the security room to watch the camera feed. He sits on the floor cross legged, opens the toy box, starts pulling out toys one by one. A stuffed brown bear with a missing eye, three or four toy cars, those wooden building blocks with letters on them, plastic action figures, a dump truck with one wheel missing. He lines every single one up in front of him in this perfect straight row like he's arranging them for a family photo. Then he picks up the bear and just stares at it. I check the time stamp. Ten minutes go by, he's still holding it. 15 minutes, 20 minutes, he hasn't moved at all, just sitting there looking at this beat up stuff bear. Finally he stands up, places the bear back in the toy box so carefully like he's putting a baby down to sleep, closes the lid gently. Everything else, though, he destroys it all. Picks up a toy car, smashes it with a hammer into dust, grabs the action figures, rips them apart, throws pieces against the wall, takes the wooden Blocks, throws them one by one as hard as he can. The sound is constant, just bang, crash, bang, crash, over and over. He's using hammers, bats, sometimes just his bare hands, grinding plastic into the concrete floor. By the time lunch rolls around, his shirt is soaked through with sweat. But he doesn't stop, doesn't even slow down. Goes back to our storage, grabs these old photo albums. We keep them as filler items from estate sales nobody wants. He carries like six of them back to the room, sits down again, opens the first one, looks at every single picture. Random strangers, weddings, birthdays, kids graduating, people who are probably dead now. He studies each one for maybe five seconds and tears it out, rips it to shreds.

Trophy from some kids soccer team, bends it in half. Picture frames, glass everywhere. He works for the full eight hours, never stops, never sits down except to look at photos. The noise doesn't stop for more than a few seconds at a time. By the end, the room looks like a tornado hit it. Toys scattered everywhere, shattered glass and paper covering every surface. Pieces of plastic and metal ground into powder. But that bear still sitting perfect and untouched in the yellow toy box like nothing happened around it. When his time is up, he comes out. His hands are bleeding through the gloves, knuckles split open, shirt completely soaked. You okay, I ask. He nods, starts walking toward the exit, gets to the door, stops, turns around. My son died six months ago, he says. Car accident. He was 4 years old. I don't know what to say. Just stand there. Everyone keeps telling me I need to move on. He continue. Get rid of his things, donate his toys, stop living in the past. They say I'm not healing, they say I need closure. He looks back at the destroyed room. I can destroy 1,000 toys, he says, but I can't touch his. I can rip apart 100 teddy bears, but not the one he slept with every night. He walks back to the room, picks up the yellow toy box with the bear are still inside, holds it against his chest. Can I buy this from you, he asks. I tell him it's free. Take it. He looks at me for the first time, really looks at me. Thank you, he says. Leaves carrying that toy box like it's made of glass. Walking real slow like he's afraid he'll drop it. I watched him through the front window, put it in his passenger seat, buckle it in like a person, then drive away. Never saw him again. But I kept that exact spot empty in our storage. After that day, whenever we got toy donations, I'd put them somewhere else just in case he came back. He never did.

I laughed at her. Ask someone else. Your body hasn't rejected an organ in 15 years. Anyway, I went to hang up, but she quickly spoke. It's not for me, her voice cracked. It's for my son. He's 9. Please. I felt bad for maybe four seconds. Then I remembered who I was talking to, Celeste. I'm sorry about your kid, but no, I'm not doing that. She hung up. An hour later, someone knocked on my door. It was Celeste and my brother Lennox was with her. We need to talk, Lennox said, pushing past me into my apartment. Celeste followed crying. Lennox, what are you doing here, I asked. Helping someone who actually needs help, he shot back. They spent the next hour tag teaming me. Celeste crying about her dying son, Lennox calling me a heartless coward. Every time I asked why he was here, he diverted the subject to me being selfish. Finally, after a million knows, Celeste looked me dead in the eye and said, you're going to donate whether you like it or not. Over the next week, they kept ambushing me together. I'd be eating lunch and suddenly Lennox and Celeste would be there causing a riot in the restaurant and yelling that I was happy to kill a child, loud enough for everyone to judge me. Then Celeste took it further. She showed Up at my office while I was on a zoom call with the CEO with the kid beside her, a pale, thin 9 year old in a hospital mask. My boss was talking about a promotion when she walked him right up to my desk. This is the man who can save your life, she told the kid loud enough for everyone to hear. The kid looked at me with huge eyes, are you going to save me? My boss stopped speaking, staring at Celeste who had her phone out filming. I felt my face burning. Celeste, this isn't fair. What's not fair is letting a child die, she said. Still filming, she turned to the CEO. Your worker is choosing to let a child pass away. My boss hung up shortly and the rumor spread like wildfire. That night, Lennox showed up at my apartment with papers, legal documents. I talked to a lawyer, he said, spreading them on my kitchen counter. You can be sued for failure to render aid to a minor. You could face charges. I picked up the papers. They looked official, court letterhead, legal language, the whole thing. Just sign the consent form, Lennox said, or deal with this in court. I told him to get out. The next morning, I was researching these documents when Lennox texted me, good luck. Before I could even respond, my doorbell rang.

But she wasn't laughing when I took her literally. I've been married to Lisa for 5 years. I'm an engineer making 70 eight K. She's a nurse practitioner making 82 K. Always pulled our money together into joint accounts. Last month, Lisa comes home from her girls night all excited. Babe, Sarah and Jen both have separate finances with their husbands. We're both doing so well financially. What if we each just handle our own expenses? More independence, you know, more modern. Honestly, it sounded reasonable. We're both adults making decent money. Why not? Sure, let's split everything. Fifty fifty. Rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, everything. She seemed a bit surprised by how specific I was getting. Well, I meant more like we each pay for our own stuff. You handle the bills you want, I handle mine. More flexible. Red flag. But I agreed anyway. Maybe she had a point about flexibility. So the next day, I sat down with our budget and divided everything perfectly down the middle. Rent one, $400 each. You abilities, $150 each. Internet, $50 each. Groceries, $400 each. Insurance, $200 each. Car payments, gas, personal expenses, all separate. I made a nice little spreadsheet and showed her. She said, wow. Okay. Very thorough, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Here's what I didn't expect. Lisa is absolutely terrible with money. Always has been. I just never noticed because I've been handling all our Finances. For five years, we never had to budget or track expenses. Week 2. Hey, babe, can you cover utilities this month? I bought this amazing Korean skincare set that was on sale. I'll pay you back next week. Week 3. My half of rent is gonna be a few days late. Had to get my car detail failed and got those highlights I've been wanting. You don't mind covering me, right? Week four. Can you grab groceries this week? I'm a little short until payday. Work has been so stressful. I deserve that shopping trip. I started keeping track of every loan in my phone just out of curiosity. Meanwhile, I'm actually thriving without her impulse purchases draining our joint account. I'm in.

I've been hosting every single holiday for my husband Nathan's family for five years straight. We're talking 14 people showing up at my house expecting miracles, while his mom, Linda, parks herself in my kitchen watching me cook like she's Gordon Ramsay. Last month when I was preparing a family dinner, she followed me around the kitchen saying things like, that's not how my mother made gravy, but I guess your mother never taught you anything. Then she turned to Nathan's sister Amy and whispered loud enough for me to hear, I don't know why he married someone who can't even cook a proper meal. When we sat down to eat, Linda took one tiny bite of my perfectly roasted chicken into her napkin and announced to the whole table, this is completely dry. I feel bad for my son having to eat like this every night. Nathan just kept shoveling food in his face. Linda kept going, pushing her plate away. My mother would roll over in her grave seeing this pathetic attempt at a family dinner. That's when I set down my wine glass, smiled my sweetest smile and said, you know what, Linda, you're absolutely right. Why don't you show us how it's and make Thanksgiving This year? Everyone froze with their forks in the air. Nathan actually looked up from his plate for the first time. What Linda's face went from smug to panic, but she covered it with this weird laugh. I suppose I could show you all how it's actually supposed to be done. She spent the rest of dinner going on about her mother's secret stuffing recipe and how she'd make everything from scratch. The week before Thanksgiving, Linda called me asking, how many pounds do you think the Turkey should be? Oh, Linda, I wouldn't know since I never Learned to cook properly, remember? She called again asking, what temperature do you cook it at? Gosh, Linda, I just guess since I don't actually know how to cook. The night before Thanksgiving, she called pan making because she just remembered the Turkey needs to defrost. How long does that take? I said, someone with your expertise would know that and hung up. Thanksgiving morning, I rolled up to Linda's at 9 sharp with Starbucks. Linda answered the door already crying and still in her bathrobe. The 20 pound Turkey was sitting in her sink like a frozen bowling ball. It won't defrost, she screamed.

I said cancel the entire wedding. The call came Tuesday morning while I was editing a commercial in my home studio. This is Renee from Perfect Day Planning calling about Jared's wedding next month. Her voice sounded uncomfortable. I have some difficult news. Your family contacted us yesterday and asked us to remove you from the guest list entirely. They mentioned some family disagreements and said you wouldn't be welcome at the ceremony or reception. I paused my editing software. My family still sees me as the 29 year old college dropout who threw his life away to become a freelance videographer. What they don't know is what I actually do with all that video equipment filling my garage. However, Renee continued nervously. They also specifically requested to keep the fifty thousand dollar deposit you paid for the wedding photography package. Mrs. Ruth said the family had already allocated those funds to other wedding expenses and couldn't possibly return them. I leaned back in my chair looking at the wall of awards behind me, Emmy nominations, industry recognition, contracts with Fortune 500 company. It's my little video hobby. Had quietly become a 15 million dollar production company over the past eight years. Renee, I need to ask you something important. What's the name of your wedding venue? The Riverside Manor downtown. And who owns that property? I heard papers shuffling. On her end. Um, it's listed under Sunset Holdings LLC. Right. What about your catering company? Golden Plate Catering Services, also owned by Longer Pot Sunset Holdings LLC as well. Wait, what's going on here? The photography studio handling the wedding photos, Elite Moment Studio. Oh my god. That's also Sunset Holdings. The florist providing all the arrangements, Ella's Garden Creations. That's, that's you too, isn't it? The DJ company, the luxury transportation service, the rehearsal dinner venue, even the hotel block for out of town guests, all owned by Sunset Holdings LLC, which is my company. Renee's voice went up an octave. Mr Ruth, are you telling me that you own every single vendor for this wedding? I'm telling you that for the past eight months I've been secretly funding my brother's entire dream wedding through shell companies. I created every vendor, every service, every single detail of this wedding, all paid for by me through different LLCs so my family wouldn't know their disappointment son was actually footing the entire Bill for everything. This can't be happening. When I dropped out of film school 7 years ago, my parents told everyone I was throwing my life away. While they focused on Jared's safe marketing career at his corporate job, I was quietly building a production empire. Corporate videos, national commercials, award winning documentaries. I work with Netflix, HBO, major advertising agencies. But to my family, I'm still just a failure who plays with cameras. Sir, what exactly are You saying? I'm saying cancel everything. The venue rental, catering contract, floral arrangements, photography package, DJ services, transportation, all of it. Every single contract goes through companies I own. the wedding is in three weeks. There are.

When I was 15, my older brother Eric left home after this huge screaming match with our dad. Dad had always been super strict about everything, grades, curfew, chores, you name it. But Eric was 18 and wanted to do his own thing. You know, they got into it over something stupid like Eric staying out past midnight on a weekend. I remember standing at the top of the stairs listening to them yell. Dad was going off about respect and responsibility and Eric was shouting back about how nothing he ever did was good enough. Then dad said the words that still give me chills. If you walk out that door, don't bother coming back. Eric grabbed his backpack, stuffed some clothes in it and slammed the front door so hard the whole house shook. Mom tried calling him that night, but his phone went straight to voicemail. She left like 20 messages. Dad just sat in his recliner watching TV, acting like nothing happened. But I could tell he was waiting for Eric to come crawling back. We all were. Days turned into weeks. Mom would set an extra plate at dinner out of habit, then quietly put it away. She'd leave Eric's bedroom door open and sometimes I'd catch her just standing there staring at his unmade bed. Dad never talked about it, but he started checking his phone constantly, probably hoping for a text or Something I kept thinking Eric would show up for my birthday in October or maybe Thanksgiving when Christmas came and went with no word. I figured he was just being stubborn. Maybe he got a job somewhere. Maybe he had a girlfriend. Maybe he was living his best life and just didn't want to deal with family drama. Mom would cry sometimes when she thought nobody was looking. She sit at the kitchen table late at night staring at her phone waiting for a call that never came. Dad would find her there in the morning and they'd have these weird, quiet conversations that stopped when I walked in. Years went by. I graduated high school, started college. Sometimes I'd wonder if Eric even knew I existed anymore. I used to imagine running into him at a gas station or something and he'd be all successful and happy and we'd laugh about how stupid that fight was. I, I pictured him having kids someday that I'd never meet. The hardest part was how dad changed. He got softer with me. Like he was scared I'd leave, too. He'd ask about my friends, my classes, even offered to help with homework. He didn't understand. It was nice but also weird because I could tell he was thinking about Eric the whole time. Then I turned 21 and everything fell apart. I was at my apartment when this cop showed up at my door with an envelope they've been trying to reach My parents but couldn't get through. The letter was from the state police and it had Eric's name on it. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely read it. They'd found remains behind this old abandoned gas station about two towns over. Dental records confirmed it was Eric. The estimated time of death was about a month after he left home. Six years. He'd been dead for six whole years and we never knew. I drove home and found mom in the kitchen making dinner, like any other night when I told her.

So I snapped. What I discovered when I got there made me realize I'd raised a monster and I had to choose between my son and doing what was right. When my daughter in law, Emma called asking me to visit, I could hear something was wrong. She just had the baby three weeks ago, but her voice sounded hollow, defeated. I just, I need help, she whispered into the phone. But don't tell Kevin I called you. Red flag No. 1. Why couldn't she tell my son she needed support? I drove the four hours to their house. Immediately Kevin answered the door looking well rested, freshly showered, wearing clean clothes. Mom, what are you doing here? Emma called, I said, pushing past him. Where is she? I found Emma in the nursery, still in the same pajamas she'd probably worn for days. The baby was screaming. Emma was crying. The house was a disaster. Honey, when's the last time you slept, I asked. I don't know, she said, bouncing the baby mechanically. Tuesday, what day is it now? It was Friday. Kevin walked in, eating a sandwich. She's been a little emotional lately, he said casually. Hormones, you know? I looked at my son, my son who I'd raised to respect women and felt sick. When's the last time you held your daughter, I asked him. I held her yesterday, he said defensively, for like 20 minutes while Emma showered. 20? Minutes in a week. Your wife just had major surgery. She needs help. I work all day, he said. I'm tired, too. Emma was back at work. No, turns out Kevin meant his part time job at his buddies auto shop. Three days a week, four hours each. Meanwhile, Emma was up every two hours feeding the baby, doing all the night wakeings, plus somehow managing to keep the house from completely falling apart. I told her she could sleep when the baby sleeps, Kevin said, like he'd solve the problem, but she always finds something to clean instead. I watched Emma flinch at this like she was afraid to rest. That's when I realized what was really happening here. Emma, show me your phone, I said gently. She hesitated, glancing at Kevin nervously. It's okay, I said. Just show me. Her text messages with Kevin were.

The father of her child was the boy who just brushed past her. His face revealed nothing but coldness and indifference. At that moment, his gaze was suddenly drawn to the new transfer student. One glance was all it took for him to choose his next prey. That's right, she was Nano, the daughter of Satan. Just like in the first season's plot, Nano once again appeared in the school as a transfer student and she immediately set her sights on the darkest, most evil person on campus. The boy had already marked Nano as his target. Her kind hearted desk mate warned her to stay far away from this guy because the boy named Jack was the headmaster's only son. He had already knocked up more than 10 girls and would mercilessly abandon them afterwards. The hunter always appears in the guys of the hunted. By lunchtime, she had already thrown herself into Jack's arms. They became a couple on the very first day. Classmates even started placing bets, guessing how many days it would take Jack to have his way with Nano. During this time, the pregnant Lisa kindly caution Nano not to become the next victim. If you think you're a victim, that's what you'll be. Unexpectedly, on the third day, they crossed the final line. After achieving his goal, Jack flaunted his conquest in front of everyone. It Only took him three days, three hours and 33 minutes, once again breaking his previous record. Then everyone took out their betting slips to see whose guess was the closest. Some guessed 8 days, others five days. Everyone's predictions were quite close, but not a single person guessed correctly. That's when Nano appeared. She picked up a small note and read it aloud. The number on the note matched exactly three days, 3 hours and 33 minutes. And the person who placed that bet turned out to be none other than herself. Everyone was shocked by this revelation right then. Jack walked in. Look here, you just got played. The plot took a sudden twist. But before long, during a physical exam, Jack discovered that he, a man, was somehow pregnant.

He races to a store, but it's already closed. Desperate for a smoke, he tries to snatch someone else's cigarette. Just as he's about to light it, an axe comes flying toward him. he notices a person standing nearby with a whole pile of cigarettes. He rushes over and picks up a piece of paper to gather any leftover tobacco that's fallen, but the scraps aren't enough to roll a cigarette. He looks around and spots a half smoked cigarette on the ground. He reaches for it, but a passerby steps on it and crushes it. Finds another unfinished cigarette in an elevator, but as soon as he grabs It the doors close on him. Out of options, he jumps on a man and begs him for a cigarette. The man hands him one and lights it with a lighter. And just like that, he's a smoker again.

Whenever one of her tears falls into the water, it transforms into a pearl. And just a single pearl can be worth billions. For the greed of these pearls, humans are willing to go to any extent. One man crossed all limits. He pushed his own daughter into the river to use her as bait for the mermaids. Suddenly, through a swarm of fish, a large, shimmering tail appeared. It was an ancient mermaid. The mermaid swam gracefully toward the girl and smiled at her. She immediately took a liking to the girl. Gently, she held the girl's hand, because this was how mermaids showed friendship. But the girl began to suffocate and was on the verge of drowning. At the last moment, the mermaid grabbed her hand tightly and threw her out of the water. The father rushed forward and dragged his daughter to the river bank. Relieved to see the girl safe, the mermaid smiled. But then that cruel father did the unthinkable. He began strangling his own daughter. His only goal was to make the mermaid cry so he could harvest her tears as pearls. And when the mermaid saw the girl's life slipping away, tears of agony welled up in her eyes. As soon as those tears fell into the river, they turned into glowing, radiant pearls.

Each one was worth a whopping $9,000. But this was no ordinary factory. It was a hundred year old pickle factory. The factory had so many rats that it was impossible to count them. The owner hired a skilled rat hunter to get rid of them and that person was honey. Every day his only thought was, if I just work a little harder, I'll become the richest man in the village. But fate had other plans. One day while working, his foot slipped and he fell straight into a large pickle pot. No one there even looked at him. They simply closed the pot's lid. Immediately the factory was shut down due to a government investigation. That pot became his prison. Time passed. 100 years later, two children visited the old factory. Out of curiosity, they opened the old pot and then something unimaginable happened. Honey was alive. He slowly emerged from the pot unharmed or showing signs of old age. Children ran away in fear, but honey was astonished. Even after 100 years, his body remained the same. He went straight to the doctor and asked, where is my wife now? The doctor said, it's been 70 years since your wife passed away. You should start a new life now. Find a new partner. Hearing this, honey flew into a rage. He knocked the doctor out with a single punch when he Learned that he had a great Grandson, he became emotional and ran out of the hospital with him. He was amazed by the world outside. For the first time, he saw such tall buildings and such fast moving vehicles. Everything seemed magical to him. But as a taxi approached him, he recoiled in fear. Then he said, let's go to my wife's grave. His great grandson took him there, but his heart broke when he saw the filth around the grave.

He quietly dropped two toothbrushes into a woman's bag. Then he picked up a small toy and placed it in a child stroller. After that, he grabbed a pair of shoes from the shelf and slipped them into an old man's coat pocket. He even stuck a price tag into a salesman's hair. He was handing out items to random people in the store. Then he started his actual shopping and picked the keep his chewing gum. When he reached the billing counter, the customer before him was just leaving when suddenly an alarm went off. Then the door alarm rang, too. One by one, multiple alarms started blaring. A sales girl came to check, but strangely, every time she walked past him, the alarm buzzed again. Even though he had nothing suspicious, just the supervisor was called and later they decided the alarm system was faulty. So anyone who had paid was allowed to leave. When this man walked out, all the alarms started ringing again. But the salesman said the system was broken just like that. The man left with everything without spending a single coin. Later, he saw an empty cup left on a table. He swapped it with a fresh coffee cup. Then he picked Up a piece of bread from the waiter's tray. Now he had coffee to drink and bread to eat. While leaving, he even picked up the tip left on a table. Suddenly, he saw a beautiful girl walking out. As usual, he started following her, but he did not realize that a lit cigarette had entered his pants. Just as he was about to talk to her, he felt a sudden heat on his body. Luckily, he found a half finished beer bottle nearby and used it to cool himself down.

Every day, Tom hauled in tons of cash until the palace ran out of hiding spots. Once a pile of cash fell on him when he opened a closet, barely missing him. He built a stable only to hide more money. But even that filled up. So each night he dug holes in the yard to bury bundles, only to dig them up the next day when space ran.

And his deposits were so huge that a dozen banks opened because of him, even clearing vault space just for his cash. Soon, Tom had billions spread across those banks. Next, he needed to launder it. So he set up dozens of fake, putting elderly and homeless people nominally in charge while he controlled everything. launderer could not keep pace with how fast he was depositing money and everyone suspected his cash was dirty, though no local cop dared to arrest him. Instead, the CIA and da started asking him for favors. In fact, Tom had once been an ordinary pilot with a salary barely covering living costs and he had occasionally smuggled items On the side, the CIA Learned about it, but rather than arrest him, they blackmailed him, needing his flying skills for a risky mission, fly low over Central America to photograph rebel camps. Tom, who liked danger, agreed. But the job proved far more dangerous than he expected. Bullets often flew as he passed rebel camps. Yet his flying saved him time and again. After repeatedly flying through the rain soaked jungles of Central America, a Colombian drug cartel noticed him and that is where Tom's luck began to change.

Despite the cold, he runs in just a vest. In the beginning, he runs faster than everyone. A professional coach notices him, but as the race continues, his energy fades. In the end, he loses. He feels sad and goes to the hospital. But a nurse tells him not to give up. So the boy starts again with full determination. The coach sees his dedication and agrees to train him using scientific methods. One day, the boy prepares to run in the rain. He finishes the first lap in 15 minutes. His pace keeps dropping, and The coach thinks he will quit, but the boy doesn't stop. He keeps running and completes the final lap in just five minutes. The coach is shocked. Everything the boy does is only for his mother. One day, he sits beside her and prays from his heart. Then he catches a train to Boston. The Marathon begins, and he leads from the start. His coach cheers for him in the stadium. In the middle of the race, he falls to second place. But every time someone tries to pass him, he runs faster. Only 200 meters left now. Now just two runners are left. All the school kids are shouting his name. Everyone hopes for a miracle. Finally, the boy crosses the finish line. He goes to the hospital and puts the medal in his mother's hand. And in the very next moment, a miracle really happens.

As soon as the horn blew, the girl playing the fox, Laura, sped off on her cycle. Five seconds later, all the cyclists started chasing her. The hunt had begun. If Laura could stay free until the paint ran out, she would win £600. This time, Laura was the fox. He had always been fast since childhood and loved the thrill of being chased. To confuse the crowd, Laura jumped onto a moving truck. The cyclists followed the paint trail and reached the spot, but suddenly the trail disappeared. Everyone split up to search for her in different directions. A few minutes later, Laura climbed down from the truck, but one of the hunters spotted her from the front. She rode as fast as she could, but the cyclist behind her was closing in quickly. At the last second, Laura made a sharp turn near a bench, and the cyclist lost control, crashing into the grass. Now Laura was alone. She took a deep breath and started riding calmly down the road. Then she noticed a man walking ahead who looked just like her lost father. From behind her, speed slowed as she moved closer, but when she saw his face, he was a stranger. And right then, the door of a parked car in front of her suddenly opened.

He hit the brakes and stopped the jet. The squadron leader was shocked because the runway was clear and there was no wall at all. He thought maybe the pilot was just exhausted and imagining things, so he called a military doctor and ordered him to be sent to the hospital to find the truth. Another skilled pilot asked for permission to try a test flight. But as soon as he tried to take off, he too saw the same wall and used the emergency brakes. After landing, he told the squadron leader that there really was a wall. For safety, the leader decided to cancel the mission. But then a third pilot stepped up and insisted on testing it himself. The same thing happened again. He saw the wall and slammed the brakes in fear. The squadron leader got very angry and canceled the test flight plan. He called the best pilot for a serious talk. Even though no accident had happened yet, the leader knew that if the pilots lost confidence, disaster could strike anytime. The pilot agreed the matter was serious, but argued that it was just an illusion because there was nothing on the runway. He thought maybe the whole team was imagining it due to exhaustion. Still, the leader wanted to solve this mystery because it was about the safety of every pilot. They all went into the flight simulation Room! The leader tested many scenarios on the computer, but found nothing unusual. The pilot explained that the wall only appeared during real flights, never in simulations. He insisted on testing at the actual airfield. At once, they went there. The pilot quickly got into the cockpit. The leader worried he might be too tired and cause an accident. But the pilot was determined. He started the fighter jet, and before takeoff, he looked toward the clouds. This time, the test flight was a success. Success! No wall appeared. The team was relieved and happy. Finally, in a meeting, the pilot revealed the truth. There was never a real wall on the runway. What actually happened was that the light and shadows kept changing because of the clouds in the sky. When the pilots were fully focused, those shifting shadows created an illusion on the runway, making it look like a giant wall had suddenly appeared.

Hernandez. Code red. Code red. We have a medical emergency on the 12 medical team stand. What is the most significant takeaway from your findings? Well, for an individual who was only 27 at the time that he died, he had very advanced disease, especially in the frontal lobes, which are very important for decision making, judgment and impulse control. But we could also see damage to the inner chambers of the brain, the septum. And this would be the first case we've ever seen of that kind of damage in such a young individual. His brain had actually begun to shrink. Had he lived, Mr Hernandez would likely be 10 years away from being totally impaired. This is not going to be a day where you're going to hear very many eulogies of Aaron Hernandez and you won't hear one from me. My heart goes out to loved ones whose lives were impacted by the transgressions of Aaron Hernandez. I have no sympathy for him whatsoever. Some people will say, yeah, but look what he did. No, but he's still a son, he's still a father. He's still a man that's been in society. And I just hope we all can learn from it. I would have been duped by this. I would have closed my eyes in the gladiator sport of football and plunged with a five year commitment because football wise he had been nothing but exemplary. Dan Miller, he runs hard, got good lower body. Strength, good balance. He breaks tackles. He's, you know, he's tough to defend. What do you think about the Aaron Hernandez findings? Yeah, that's not, you know, my, uh, the medical department, that's the medical staff. How do you feel the NFL handles informing the players of the dangers of CTE? Yeah, look, I'm not a doctor, not a trainer. I'm a coach. The medical staff, they do the medical part. I don't do that. You have a good one. Alright, I gotta go pick up Avy. I'll see you on Monday.

 #MLBTradeDeadline #Phillies #BaseballUpdates #SportsNews#USA","usa,phillies,sportsnews,mlbtradedeadline,baseballupdates","Excuse me, excuse me. I need some help over here. She's been screaming blue murder since Michigan City, right? I pulled over a couple of times so she could throw up, but she says it hurts too much to walk. How old is Lindsay? She's 14. Her last pregnancy she'd get sick like this, but not with all this blood and give your daughter a little more privacy. My daughter Lindsay's my wife. This marriage is legal. That guy and a 14 year old girl. Her father gave us consent and a judge signed off on it. So, yeah. What about her mother? Now she died when Lindsay was only 3. That man should be arrested, right? And on what charges? Rape, coercion, whatever. This girl is a kid. She obviously had no choice in the matter. He barely lets her speak. Can we call on the police? Family services? No. Unfortunately, we're required to respect Michigan state law. How's the girl doing? She's undergoing a DNC to get rid of any products for a prior miscarriage. Yeah, which the Reverend only. Okay, because he wants Lindsay to be able to conceive as soon as possible. I realize this is distasteful for all of us, but I implore both of you to do your best. The gynecologist found a tumor growing within the tissue that would have become the placenta. Given that we caught it relatively early, these tumors generally respond favorably to chemotherapy. And if that doesn't work, what happens? Then worst case scenario, we would need to consider a hysterectomy. Next, she's scheming to remove your womb altogether. I can assure you there is no scheming going on. Chemo can lead to infertility. Not necessarily. Yes, there are some risk factors. But to do nothing at all would be far, far riskier. No, thank you. Then we will not be doing any chemotherapy. I'm not sure I should be talking to you alone. Listen, I'm not sure how you feel about being married, but the one advantage that it does give you is that you are considered by law to be medically emancipated. What are you doing? Nothing. I was just conferring with my patient, Lindsay. Regardless of what this man thinks or wants, it is your body and your choice. So step outside. What do you want to do? So step outside. Get your hands off of me. You have been willful and argumentative. My patient has the right to decide how she wants to treat her cancer. Cancer is you. You've been treating Lindsay like she's a child, not a woman. She is a child. She's fourteen. Just because you had some judge sign off on what? Excuse me. Excuse me. I need to talk to someone in charge here. Excuse me. I. I know you have some big decisions to make, but I won't be able to get you the medical attention you need unless you speak up right now. My mother died when she was 19. She had ovarian cancer. My great grandmother, too. It's the family curse. The lady doctor said something earlier about a hysterectomy. Doctor Manning. Yes. Now, that is only if you get sicker. With the right medicine, you have a great chance of beating this. You can live a long life, have a family someday. No, I want a hysterectomy. A hysterectomy is really not necessary at this point. I don't care. Some women have their breasts removed if they have the cancer gene just so they don't get it later. Right. But you are so young. Hysterectomy is irreversible. You will not be able to become pregnant and have children ever. You don't know my life. You don't understand. I don't wanna bring a kid into this world. Doctor Manning said it was my decision. What is going on here? Lindsay has decided to have a hysterectomy over my dead body. She is my wife. I make the decisions. Sir, please move. You lay so much as a finger on her and I will sue you. To kingdom come. We have her consent. You lied to me. She can't make that kind of decision for herself. She was obviously coerced. He forced you to sign this, didn't he? No, it was my decision. You have two seconds to step aside, Mr Craig. I will have you forcibly removed from the premises. You, you go through this, Lindsay, and you will be banished by the church, the community, everything. You Will be diminished in the eyes of the Lord.

How troublesome could a household be with only Lady Burbrook and the young Lord Burbrook to look after? No, you have no idea. You ate but not one bite at tea, my dear. A young lady must be well fed if she is to bear children. Kippers on rye every morning worked wonders for me when I conceived my Nigel. What have you found? What is going on? you could not think I would ask that woman for tea without a thought for you, could you? The help is everything, as we all know. She has heard a good deal. In fact, Lord Burbrook has a boy by one of his maids that he refused to provide for, sent the Maiden child away to live off scraps. Horrible man, horrible enough for us to be rid of him. Let us pray. Well, he will only deny it. And who will believe a group of women over a man's word? Perhaps no one, but they will. If Lady Whistle Down does so, we shall do what women do, we shall talk.

It changed from animal to human like. But it became really aggressive. That was the problem. They wanted obedient creations. Failed experiments got burned. I figured out what was wrong. The animals were fighting the white gas in the chamber. That's why evolution kept failing. They tried again using my method. This time it worked. The animals stayed calm.

He ordered our brains to be dissected for study. Back in the cell, I gathered parts from the floor. I told my friends the truth. Our lives would end tomorrow. We have to escape right now.

He only repaired old ones with glue and torn rubber from used tires. The boy didn't like those shoes, but he never dared to complain. The next day when he went to school wearing those strange shoes, all his classmates started laughing at him.

The teacher never allowed anyone without shoes to sit in his class, so the boy was forced to wear those old shoes again. Student started laughing once more. The teacher banged his stick on the table and the whole class went silent. He said the boy should not feel ashamed for not having shoes because even he once lived without them. He explained to everyone that people who mock others for being poor should be ashamed of themselves. After hearing that, the boy regained his confidence. But his bad luck continued. His father lost his job and the family Became even poorer. The boy had to eat spoiled food every day and soon fainted from weakness. He was taken to the hospital but was quickly discharged because the family had no money. Things got worse when a new baby was born. His mother went every day to collect food from charity centers and often had to borrow from others. Seeing all this, the boy realized he needed to earn money.

He looked at Benny like he was arguing with an old friend. Finally, he climbed to the top of a mountain and took down the rope he had once planned to use to end his life. Before leaving, he decorated Benny, carved a goodbye message on a stone wall and tied Benny to the front of his boat. He also took the only parcel he had never opened. Then he set off toward the sea.

Thinking of his traitor teammate, Jack agreed immediately. He even helped repair their rocket launcher. Soon. Soon, Jack LED the gorilla team to chase a Soviet tank. The tank commander set up the machine gun and started firing. But the bullets ran out quickly and the engine overheated. The tank couldn't start again. As the gorillas got closer, the commander somehow restarted the tank. Covered in thick smoke, the tank tried to escape, but due to damage, it couldn't go fast. Jack took a shortcut and caught up. He aimed the rocket launcher and fired The rocket hit the turret and blew it off, but the tank still kept moving. Suddenly, big rocks rolled down from the top of a hill and hit the tank directly. The tank's tracks broke and it stopped. At that moment, a woman appeared above and threw a grenade. It turned out the Afghan women had returned. In the end, the tank commander gave up and came out with two soldiers surrendering without a fight.

Then his partner, Jimmy, faked an asthma attack in front of the prison guard. This way he could not only easily make an impression of the keys on the guard, but also get sent to the infirmary for treatment and make contact with the doctor. Seeing the doctor's damaged car window, Jimmy mentioned he used to be an auto mechanic. To thank the doctor for the asthma medication, he offered to fix the car for free. The doctor happily agreed. Once he got access to the car, Jimmy appeared to be repairing the windshield, but was actually secretly modifying the trunk, preparing for his upcoming escape. On the day of the escape, his partner played an important role again. Since he was a good cook, he often helped out in the kitchen. Using ingredients from the kitchen, he grew a type of hallucinogenic mushroom. Then he ground these mushrooms into powder and secretly put it into the prisoner's food. After constantly stirring, the powder completely blended with the food. The prison guards and prisoners couldn't tell anything was wrong at all. Before long, the drug took effect. Prisoners who ate the food all started hallucinating. The hallucinations made them extremely excited. Some even started dancing wildly. A large number of guards rushed over to maintain order to avoid suspicion. His partner also Pretended to be excited from food poisoning, then cut his palm with a knife. Meanwhile, Jimmy once again faked an asthma attack and was sent to the infirmary. This way, the two could successfully meet up in the infirmary. Since the prisoner's behavior was getting increasingly strange, the prison guards urgently needed help from the infirmary. After receiving the notice, the doctors quickly grabbed their medical kits and rushed to the cafeteria. Now, only Jimmy and his partner were left in the entire infirmary. Jimmy quickly pulled out the nail he had prepared in advance and unlocked both of their handcuffs. Then he found a bottle of liquid nitrogen by the hospital bed and used it to rapidly lower the temperature of the sensor lock, causing it to malfunction and automatically open the ward door. Next, they came to the back door of the infirmary and inserted their homemade key into the lock. But this key was made of soap. If they used too much force, it would break. If they didn't use enough force, they couldn't open the door. Just as the two didn't know what to do, they heard a prison guard's voice from the infirmary. To buy Jimmy more time to pick the lock, his partner decided not to escape. He planned to sacrifice himself and run out to hold off that lustful female guard.

This time, when he cooked that sea, the taste was totally different. Slightly sweet and delicious. He realized steam had built up inside the packet because of moisture. Then he remembered this packet got soaked in the rain last night. The extra salt had drained out and that's what made it taste better. So he followed the same process and made new seaweed chips. He packed them nicely and went to give samples to a food company manager. But without even tasting, the manager said, sorry, not interested. Disappointed, he left the box full of seaweed packets there. A little later, a staff member saw the box, took a chip and tried it. The taste was so good, he shared it with others.

His wife's two fingers were crossed in a way that looked like a silent apology to god. This sign meant their marriage wasn't real. The next day, Truman didn't ask his wife directly. Instead, he went close to her, acting normal, trying to find out what she was hiding for all these years. But his wife seemed to already know what Truman was planning. He quickly made an excuse, saying she had an urgent surgery to do. Normally, she wasn't this busy, but today she was acting very different. Seeing this, Truman's doubts became stronger. As his wife was about to leave, Truman casually said, I'll cross my fingers for you. She stopped, looked back, forced a smile, and rushed out. Truman quietly followed her to the hospital, but a nurse stopped him at the entrance. He pretended to leave, but quickly turned and followed the nurse. On the way, a crowd of patients in wheelchairs blocked his path. Truman smartly changed his route. In the corridor, he bumped into a nurse pushing a trolley. He said, let me help you. After crossing all obstacles, Truman finally reached the operating room. But what he saw looked like bad acting. Just as the surgeon was about to begin, the patient who was supposed to be unconscious suddenly sat up. Truman realized this whole setup was fake. His wife wasn't really a doctor. But he had no idea. The lie was this Big. It wasn't just his wife who was. Truman noticed that everything around him was repeating in a pattern. To test this, he started doing strange things. He stopped in the middle of the road to tie his shoe, then sat down and carefully watched the world around him. He finally believed everyone and everything was on a loop. He looked for a break in the pattern and spotted a strange man in the crowd. The man, wearing a cap, was watching Truman closely. But when Truman noticed him, he quickly disappeared. Truman tried to follow, but a bus suddenly stopped in front of him. At that moment, he remembered the next vehicle would be green. He turned with confident and tried to stop the green car. That moment made him believe even more that something was wrong. He suddenly ran into a company building where no one recognized him. People panicked seeing it. When the elevator doors opened, Truman saw it wasn't a lift, but the backstage of a TV set. A security guard told him it was under construction, pushed him out. But this excuse only raised more doubt. After all these strange events, Truman realized he had only seen a glimpse of the truth. In reality, he was living on a giant set. An island called Tao Yun was filled with 6,000 hidden cameras that were broadcasting Truman's life non stop. Two billion people watched his birth and 190 countries saw him learning to walk the ocean. Was fake. The sky was fake. And even the people on the island were fake. They had lived, worked and grown with Truman for 30 years. He lived under the eyes of cameras. Even his wife had given up her youth just to play his wife. The audience was tired of fake expressions and overacting. So a director created The Truman Show, the world's most famous reality show.

She poured the acid onto the metal lock and the chain melted instantly. Her team quickly opened the door. Mia grabbed the phone just before the countdown ended, but strangely, there was no sound from the receiver. Only 20 seconds were left when Mia noticed an image containing a clue. She ran toward a nearby taxi. But now just three seconds remained. At that moment, Nina saw an umbrella and threw it to Mia. The umbrella protected her for only a few seconds. Right before it was about to collapse, the taxi door opened and Mia jumped inside. The acid rain paused for a moment, giving the two women in the phone booth a chance to run toward the taxi to escape the rain. But at the very last moment, the taxi doors locked automatically. The booth Door slammed shut again and the acid rain was about to start falling once more.

So my boyfriend, Jake, literally cannot let me finish a single sentence without correcting me, arguing with me or explaining why I'm wrong. And yesterday I finally turned it around on him. This man would argue with me if I said the sky was blue, he'd say, actually it's more of a cyan and launch into a lecture about light wavelengths. I'd say I'm hungry. He'd say, no, you're not. You just ate three hours ago. You're probably just thirsty. I'd say I liked a movie. He'd explain why it was actually terrible and I just didn't understand cinema. Every opinion, every feeling, every thought I had was apparently wrong and needed his correction. The most annoying part was he'd phrase it like he was helping me be smarter. He'd start with actually or, well, technically or let me explain why that's not quite right. Like I was a toddler who needed basic concepts explained. Once said my head hurt and he goes, it's probably not a headache. You're likely experiencing tension from poor posture. Like he was inside my skull feeling what I felt. He argued about the dumbest things, too. I said I saw 12 birds on the wire outside and he made me go back and count them to prove they were only 11. I said the restaurant was about five minutes away and he pulled up Google Maps to show it was Actually seven minutes. Said my mom called me twice and he checked my phone log to point out she called three times but I missed one. It was exhausting. I started not talking just to avoid the corrections. But even silence wasn't safe because then he'd argue about why I was quiet, saying I was being passive aggressive or Moody. Really, I just didn't want to hear another lecture about why my thoughts were wrong. Last week I tested him and said something completely factual, that the capital of France is Paris. And he goes, well, actually it depends on what you mean by capital because historically there were different administrative regions. And went on for 10 minutes. He couldn't even let me have Paris. The breaking point was building for weeks. Every time he corrected me, I'd just say, okay, but I was keeping track. 73 corrections in one week, 73 times he felt the need to explain why I was wrong about something, including my own feelings and experiences. I started writing them all down in my phone with time stamps and everything. Then yesterday we're at his friend's birthday party and I'm telling a story about my coworker. I said she was about 30 years old. And Jake immediately goes, actually she's 32. I looked her up on LinkedIn in front of everyone. His friend Tom goes, dude, why do you know her exact age? That's weird. And Jake starts arguing with Tom about how it's not Weird. To be accurate, I saw my opening and said, you know what, Jake, you're absolutely right about everything. You're right that I'm too emotional. You're right that I don't understand movies. You're.

When we arrived, there was nothing. No decorations, no food, no guests because I hadn't invited anyone. Just an empty Pavilion with picnic tables. Anthony stood there looking around while Rosie played in the dirt. His phone started ringing. His mother asking where everyone was. His siblings wondering if they had the wrong location. Turn to me with his face red. There's no party, he said, like he was just figuring it out. That's right. I said I didn't plan anything. He asked how I could Do this to his mother the same way you took our daughter to Disneyland without me. I said, Brittany can plan the party. She seems to have plenty of free time and energy. Family started arriving confused and angry. His mother called me trashy and classless, said this was why Anthony needed better influences in his life. I took Rosie and left them all standing in that empty Pavilion. I filed for divorce the next Monday. He was shocked, said I was overreacting to one trip and one party. But it wasn't one anything. It was a pattern of choosing everyone except the person funding his life.

My lawyer told me my involvement made a strong case for primary custody. Six weeks in, she noticed. She tried to spark conversations. I answered in single words. She tried dressing up to get a rise too late. One night, she sat on the couch beside me. You've lost weight. You look good. Thanks. Can we talk? There's a wall between us. I'm respecting the parameters you set, I said. You were very clear about what I am to you. She tried to explain, but I asked the one question she couldn't answer. When you said I'm nothing more than a co parent, what did you expect me to do? She had no answer. The final confirmation came when I overheard her on the phone. He's completely different. Not angry, just gone. I didn't really want a divorce. I just wanted him to pay attention to me. Her bluntness revealed the manipulation. She'd hoped a threat to our marriage would make me change. Instead, I called her bluff. Three months later, I sat at the kitchen table with a Manila folder. I want a divorce, I said. Silence. I slid the folder across signed paperwork and statements and the documentation of every school event I'd covered while she was away. My lawyer's letter explained that given my role and income, primary custody was likely. She would be expected to contribute child support. Her face went white. Courts always favor the Mother, she said, not when the record shows who was actually present, I replied. The judge awarded me primary custody. Sarah kept every other weekend and one dinner per week. The look on her face was shocked. The house sold. I bought a smaller, nicer place near the kids school. Sarah moved into a one bedroom and took an entry level admin role that barely covered rent. Two years later, she still calls, sometimes after a bad date, crying about mistakes. I don't fuel that. I answer when I need to. I keep my focus on the twins. I've rebuilt a life that centers on them. I'm not interested in revenge. I'm focused on stability and on giving Ethan and Elsa the dependable home they deserve. I blocked her number for long stretches. I cleared my messages. I packed for a new start because protecting my kids mattered more than punishing anyone.

She also claims you threatened her, refused to help and told her she'd regret it. My hands clenched. That's a complete lie. Then you won't mind coming to the station. At the station, they showed me Jessica's statement. Pure fiction. She claimed I've been drinking, that I crashed, that I abandoned her. And at the bottom, witnesses David and Linda Carter, parents confirming Jessica's story. My own parents had signed a statement. Again, hence me. I leaned back, voice deadly calm. Officer, I'd like to file my own report. He raised an eyebrow. Jessica Carter stole my vehicle. I never gave permission. I want to press charges for grand theft auto. The tables turned instantly. Within three hours, Jessica's employer called. We're conducting an internal review. Your sister listed you as a character witness. I told them everything. They thanked me and hung up. Jessica called 14 times that day. I ignored everyone. Then the voicemail. They fired me. Do you hear me? They fired me. I hope you're happy. I didn't bother listening to the rest. My parents showed up that night. You need to fix this. She lost everything because of you. I shook my head. Because of me or because she lied to the police? Mom's eyes narrowed. She's your sister. If you don't take her in, she'll be homeless. I looked them both in the eyes. No. Mom gasped like I'd slapped her. You took her side. You. Called me selfish. You backed her lies, and now you want me to open my home to her. We're family, Michael. Family forgives. I exhaled slowly. Not this time. And I shut the door. Three days later, Jessica showed up, hair a mess, clothes wrinkled, eyes death desperate. Michael, I have nowhere to go. I stared at her, years of resentment boiling beneath my skin. You tried to get me arrested, Jess. I know, she whispered. I just, I need my brother back. For a split second, she looked like my little sister again. But I knew this was the moment I had to choose. You need me when it's convenient. You took my car, lied to the police, and now you expect me to forgive you. Her lips trembled. Michael, please, goodbye, Jess. And for the last time, I shut the door. Two months later, I moved. New city, new job, new life. No calls, no messages. And for the first time, I was living for me.

That's when the switch flipped. My husband took our two year old daughter to Disneyland without me because his best friend Brittany had free tickets that expired that weekend. I was working a 12 hour shift at the hospital and couldn't get coverage. He said they couldn't waste the tickets and promised to take photos. Our daughter's first time seeing Mickey Mouse and I watched it through text messages while drawing blood from patients. Brittany was in every single photo holding my daughter's hand, carrying her on her shoulders, hugging her in front of the castle. My husband barely appeared in any of them. I've been planning that Disneyland trip for months. Had a savings jar labeled Rosie's first Disney trip where I put extra money from overtime shifts, bought her a special Minnie Mouse dress she was supposed to wear, made a list of all the rides appropriate for toddlers, researched the best times to avoid crowds, even Learned where all the character meet and greet happened. But Anthony and Britney just went without any planning because free tickets don't wait. He came home that night with Rosie passed out in her car seat, chocolate on her face, wearing a new princess dress I didn't buy Brit. He had bought it for her. Inside the park said every little girl need a princess dress for Disney. Anthony thought that was Sweet. I thought about how I'd worked three extra shifts to save for that exact dress in a bigger size for when we went as a family. Britney started coming around more after that. She'd drop by during dinner because she was in the neighborhood, always brought Rosie little gifts, stickers or candy or cheap toys from the dollar store. My daughter started calling her Auntie Britt. Anthony said it was good for Rosie to have positive female influences beyond just mom. I asked what was wrong with my influence? I was always tired from work and Britney had more energy for playing. She didn't have more energy. She just didn't work 12 hour nursing shifts to pay for our mortgage while he pursued his music career that brought in maybe $200 a month from guitar lessons. Last month, Anthony informed me his mother's 70th birthday was coming up and we needed to plan something special. By we, he meant me. He wanted a full party with catering, decorations, a photo booth, a whole production that I was so good at organizing things and his mom deserved the best. His mom, who hadn't visited once since Rosie was born, who forgot my birthday every year but remembered Britney's, who asked why Anthony settled for someone who worked such long hours instead of being home. I told him I'd think about it. He'd already told his family I was handling everything. His sister called the next day asking about The menu. His brother wanted to know the menu. His mother called to say she hoped I wouldn't embarrass the family with something cheap. Meanwhile, Brittany posted photos from Disneyland every day that week, pictures I hadn't seen.

You can always sleep under the stars, they snickered. But when I turned it into a business, they wanted to share. I should have known this dinner was a setup. My parents never invited me over unless they needed something, usually to remind me I was the family disappointment. My sister, Emily, their golden child, never worked a day but somehow deserved everything. Dad folded his newspaper. We're dividing our assets. Emily lit up instantly. Mom smiled. We're giving you the beach house, sweetheart. Emily gasped like she'd won an Oscar, the one in Malibu. Then dad turned to me, expression flat. And you, Logan, we're giving you the parking lot. Silence. The what? The old lot on 8th Street, mom said, waving dismissively. It's land. Figure something out. Emily burst out laughing. At least you'll always have a place to sleep under the stars, dad chuckled. Maybe open a lemonade stand or something. I stared at them. This wasn't even disguised kindness. This, it was straight garbage. A memory flashed me at 16, holding my first paycheck from the auto shop. So proud, dad didn't even look up. You're going to smell like oil for the rest of your life. That same week, they bought Emily a brand new BMW. I pushed back from the table. You're serious, dad shrugged. You should be grateful, I stood. I'll make something of it. Emily rolled her Eyes can't wait to see what you do with a slab of concrete. Three weeks later, I had permits for food trucks. I took out a loan from my boss, a guy who actually believed in hard work, and set up lights, seating, banners. That worthless parking lot became a full blown food court with live music and lines around the block. One month in, mom showed up in her expensive coat, wrinkling her nose at the crowd. So this is what you've done? I didn't look at her. You gave me trash. I made it work. This isn't a real business, she sniffed. It's just a fate.

So I got revenge doing exactly what the judge told me to do. I came home one day to find my stuff being packed, boxes everywhere. My wife of eight years handed me a Protection order. I couldn't come home without written permission for 90 days. I had to email her just to see my own kids. I was completely blindsided. A relative connected me with this bulldog lawyer. She was brilliant and told me these orders take time to fight. We probably wouldn't see a judge before the 90 days were up. But she was crystal clear about one thing, follow the court order to the letter. Any violation and I'd be screwed if my ex tried to renew it. It took exactly one day before my ex needed me. She called asking me to watch the kids. I had crashed at a friend's house so I had nowhere to take them. We agreed I'd watch them at home. I parked three blocks away and waited for the email. She called annoyed. I reminded her about the order. No written permission, no entry. She finally sent it. This happened two more times that first week. Each time I sat in my car down the street waiting for an email while my kids were inside. So I told her moving forward, I wouldn't leave my temporary place until I had permission. That was 20 minutes away. She agreed. Then Immediately forgot. The next morning, we'd planned for me to pick up the kids and take them to school. Their school was five minutes from my work, so it made sense. I waited at my friend's place. No email came. Time kept ticking. I calculated the drive. If I left right then, I could barely make it to the house, get the kids, drop them at school and still make it to work on time. But I didn't have written permission. She called at 7:45, furious. Where are you? The kids are going to be late. I reminded her about the email. She'd forgotten to send it. Without it, I legally couldn't come and now I was out of time. Even if she sent it that second, I couldn't make the full trip and still get to work. She had to drive them herself. She ended up being very late to work that day. Her boss wasn't happy after that. She wanted to grant me blanket permission to come and go as needed, just cart launch access. My lawyer shut that down immediately. Follow the order every single time. The real payoff came three weeks later. She forgot to email again. This time I was supposed to pick up the kids for school. Same routine. I waited at my place. No email. I texted her a.

You're like a homeless person begging for change, except at least they work for their money by standing outside all day. He pulled out a five dollar Bill and threw it on the floor. There's your grocery money. You better make that stretch because that's all you're getting this week. I bent down to pick up the Bill while he filmed me with his phone. This is going to my mom so I can show her what a pathetic leech you are. He said. Maybe if you crawl for it like the dog you are, I'll give you another five. I stayed on my knees looking up at him holding his phone and his wallet full of money. Come on, just one little bark and you can feed your. So this week, he said, dangling another Bill above my head. The thing about financial abuse is that it doesn't start all at once. Seven years ago when we got married, we shared everything equally and both our names were on every account. Three years into our marriage, he got laid off from his tech job and couldn't find work for three entire years. I paid our Rent his car payment, his insurance, everything while he played video games all day and told me he was networking online. I never said a word because I loved him and that's what you do for someone you love. When he finally got a new job that paid triple what he used to, he convinced me we didn't need two incomes anymore. You've been working so hard supporting us, he said sweetly. Let me take care of you now. Within two months of me quitting, he'd removed my name from the bank accounts, which he claimed was for tax purposes. He started giving me.

I froze at the kitchen counter. Denise was upstairs putting the little ones to bed. My 16 year old son Ryan sat at the dining table. Calculus textbook open, but his eyes were locked on me. Makes you think she wants to know that. I asked carefully. She asked me yesterday when you were at work, said we needed to talk about college plans for everyone. Ryan pushed his textbook aside. She wanted exact numbers. Dad, when I said I didn't know, she said, you must have the paperwork somewhere. My stomach dropped. What did you tell her? Nothing but dad. She also asked if Mom's parents said anything aside for me, right. Brian's voice stayed steady, but his jaw was tight. Then she started talking about how tough things are, how the younger kids won't have as much saved. She said in real families, everyone shares equally. Bedroom door opened upstairs. Denise's footsteps moved toward the stairs. Ryan leaned forward quickly. She's planning something at dinner tomorrow. Heard her on the phone with her sister talking about redistributing assets and making things fair for all five kids. Denise walked into the kitchen smiling. Oh, good you're both here. Ryan, honey, we need to have a family meeting tomorrow night about college funds and planning. Can't make it, Ryan said flatly. Have practice. You'll skip It this once. This is important. Her tone was light but firm. Ryan stood up. Important like when you went through Dad's filing cabinet last week. Dead silence. Denise's smile faltered. I was looking for tax documents in the folder labeled the estate of Catherine Walsh. Ryan pulled out his phone, swiped to a photo. Because you left it open on Dad's desk. Mom's will was on top with her compensation settlement highlighted. Stepped between them, Ryan, no, dad. She's been working on this for weeks. He swiped to another photo. This is her laptop history. She looked up whether step parents can access inherited funds in our state, whether minor children's trusts can be redistributed in blended families, a petition for equal distribution of assets. Denise's face went red. You went through my computer. You went through my dead mother's financial documents. Ryan shot back. She wrote me letters before she died. Want to know what she said that the money was? To make sure I.

As soon as our principal heard that, light bulbs went off in his head. He couldn't wait for winter break to be over. And literally the first day back, as soon as first period started, we hear someone yell over the intercom, Louise, get your ass down to the principal's office right now. Our principal was sure he had him this time. Louise walked into that office like he'd done 100 times before. However, this time was different. When he got there with a smile on his face, the principal didn't ask him to empty his pockets, didn't ask about his backpack. He just looked at Louise and said, take off your shoes. Louise hesitated, uh, no, no, I don't want to listen, buddy. I'm not giving you a choice. Take them off. Luis now had no other option, so he just sat down and unlaced his shoes without putting up a fight. Okay, if you say so. He pulled them off and handed them over to him while the principal literally shook with excitement he was finally gonna catch him and it turns out his hunch was right. He looked at the ball bottom and found the hidden compartments in his shoes. They were custom made just for Louise. Louise was laughing, but the principal was so happy. This was finally Over and he finally had proof so he could expel him from school. But when the principal opened them up, ready to find the secret stash, they were completely empty. Louise was laughing his ass off at this point, literally crying in the principal's office while he just stood there holding these empty shoes. The principal says, what the hell is so funny, you little brat? Where are they? I know you're hiding them. Louise could barely contain himself. But when he finally caught his breath, he looks the principal dead in the eye and actually has the audacity to explained that out of all days, he decided to search his shoes on the first day back after winter break. Hey, man, I haven't seen any of my classmates for weeks. I haven't been able to take any orders yet. Louise graduated that year with honors because if the principal had just waited one more day, he would have caught him.

On Thanksgiving, I ate Turkey in the garage sitting on a paint bucket while my cousins asked where I was and Robert told them I was feeling sick. Christmas dinner, same thing, except it was freezing and I could hear them opening presents while I ate alone next to the car. My 16th birthday, they had cake in the dining room and Robert said I could join if I promised not to move. But when my shoulder twitched once, he pointed to the garage and said, you know the rules. Last week, my mom's sister came to visit from out of state for the first time in years. She asked where I was during dinner and Robert said I preferred to eat alone because I was self conscious about my condition. My aunt found me in the garage with my plate on a cardboard box and goes, what the hell are you doing out here? I told her everything. Three years of eating alone, being told I was disgusting, being banned from family meals because of something I can't control. She stormed back into the house and started screaming at Robert in front of his kids, his mother who was visiting, and our neighbors who'd come over. You make a child with tourettes eat in the garage? What kind of monster are you? Robert tried to say it was for everyone's comfort and my aunt Goes everyone's comfort. A 16 year old eating alone in a cold garage is comfortable. His mother asked if it was true and when Robert tried to explain his reasoning, she slapped him, actually slapped her own son across the face and said, I raised you better than this. My mom finally grew a spine and said she'd been trying to keep the peace, but she was done. Told Robert either I eat with the family starting immediately or she's filing for divorce and telling everyone in town exactly why. Kids started crying saying they didn't know I was in the garage. They thought I just didn't like them. The younger one goes, dad said she was contagious. Is Tourette's contagious? My aunt said, no, sweetie, but apparently being an asshole is because your dad caught it from somewhere. Neighbors left immediately and I heard them talking outside about how they always thought something was off about Robert. His mother made him apologize, but I said I didn't want his fake apology. I wanted 3 years of eating with my family back. She made him set my place at the table right next to hers and said if he had a problem with my tics, he could be the one eating in the garage. Now Robert has to eat dinner watching me tic as much as I want while his own mother makes sure he doesn't say a word about it.

She won't see that no matter what happened. This was her final gift to protect me. Ryan, that's not what this is about. Denise started. The other kids deserve, the other kids deserve what you and dad save for them, not what my dying mother left for me. His voice cracked slightly. You have three kids with another man who could be saving for them. You have two kids with my dad. That's five parents for four kids. I have one living parent. My mom knew that. Denise turned to me. Are you going to let him talk to me this way? Are you going to explain why you've been researching how to access his inheritance? I asked quietly. It's not fair that one child has significantly more. You're right, Ryan interrupted. It's not fair. It's not fair that my mom got cancer at 35. It's not fair that she suffered for two years because doctors missed it. It's not fair that she won't see me graduate, go to college, get married. But that money, that's her apology for having to leave me. And you want to take that, too? Denise's sister arrived for dinner the next night as planned. She came armed with spreadsheets about college costs and equity and blended families, but she didn't expect Ryan's mom's parents to be there, too. I'd called them that morning. We understand you've been asking about our grandson's inheritance, Ryan's grandfather said calmly. He was a Retired judge, still intimidating at 72. Perhaps you'd also like to discuss the trust fund we set up. Or should we talk about the legal ramifications of attempting to coerce a minor into surrendering inherited assets? Denise's sister gathered her papers. This is getting blown out of proportion. No, Ryan's grandmother said softly. What's out of proportion is thinking you have any right to money left by our daughter for our grandson. She planned for him when she knew she was dying. That money represents her love, her dreams for him, her absence. At every milestone, Denise stood up. I was just trying to make sure all the children are treated fairly. Fair. Ryan looked at his step siblings, then back at Denise. Fair would be having my mom here. But since that can't happen, I'll keep what she left me, all of it. The room went quiet. Denise looked at me for support, but I stood next to my son.

My stepfather Robert banned me from eating with the family for three years because my tics were disgusting. And yesterday he finally got exposed for the piece of shit he is. I have Tourette's and my tics are mostly motor ones, like shoulder shrugging and head jerking. Nothing crazy. But Robert acted like I was contagious. When he married my mom, I was thirteen, and the first thing he said about my tics was, can't you just stop doing that? It's annoying. My mom explained it's neurological and I can't control it, and he rolled his eyes saying I was probably faking for attention. Started with him making comments during dinner about how my tics were making him lose his appetite. Then he said my shoulder movements were distracting his kids from eating properly. These kids, by the way, are perfect little angels who can do no wrong, even when they're throwing food at each other. But my medical condition is the real problem. Apparently one night my head jerked and I knocked over my water glass and Robert lost it. I was doing it on purpose, and from now on I had to eat after everyone else was done. My mom tried to argue, but he said it was his house, his rules, and if She didn't like it. We could leave. She didn't leave, obviously. She just let him treat me like I had the plague. For three years, I ate alone in the kitchen while listening to them laugh and talk in the dining room. His kids would walk by and make faces at me, saying I was the weird garage kid. Because eventually Robert moved my eating spot to the garage, saying the kitchen was too close and he could still hear my chair moving from my tips. The garage, where we keep the lawn mower and old paint cans. That's where I ate every meal while they had family dinners 20 feet away. My mom would bring me a plate after everyone was done and sit with me for five minutes.

Everyone nodded sympathetically. I sat there silently fork scraping my plate while they took turns lecturing me about compassion and responsibility. That's when I decided enough was enough. I went home and created a presentation. Every single transaction documented, dates, amounts, her stated reasons and screenshots of what she was actually doing with the money. The emergency rent that funded a weekend in Vegas, the car repair that became designer purgers, the utility Bill that turned into a spa day. I even included her text messages. You're loaded. Just send it. I'll get you back. And my personal favourite, stop being such a tight ass. It's just money. I added a timeline showing the pattern, how she'd wait exactly 3 weeks between requests, how the amounts gradually increased, how she'd love bomb me with sweet messages right before asking for cash. The manipulation was mathematical, calculated, deliberate. The following Sunday, we had our monthly family gathering. After dinner, I connected my laptop to their TV. Monica was mid sentence talking about some new financial struggle when I interrupted. Before anyone sends her money, I think you should see something. I hit play. The spreadsheet appeared first, that massive 47,000 dollar total in red. Gasp echoed around the room. Then came the side by side comparisons. Her emergency my transfer, her Instagram post celebrating. One after another after another. My parents went pale. My aunt's jaw dropped. Monica started shouting, you're Twisting everything. That's not fair. This is harassment. I let the presentation finish. The final slide showed her recent text where she called me a selfish prick for refusing the transmission money, right next to her Facebook post from that same day showing her new 800 dollar handbag. Dad looked at Monica. You told us he never helped you. Mom's face crumbled with realization. My aunt actually apologized to me. Monica stormed out screaming about betrayal and how I ruined her life. She's blocked me on everything. My parents have started asking her for receipts before helping her financially. Last week, I got a text from my cousin, thank you. She was doing the same thing to me.

So I exposed her. I've been my sister Monica's a t m for 15 years. It started small when we were teenagers. Can you spot me $20 for gas? I'll pay you back Friday. Friday never came. But I let it slide because that's what siblings do, right? By our 20s, it escalated. $200 for car repairs, $500 for rent when her roommate bailed, $1,000 for emergency dental work that turned out to be cosmetic veneers. Every time I hesitated, she'd explode. You're my brother. You're supposed to look out for me. What kind of person are you? The guilt worked perfectly and she knew it. Last year, Monica called at eleven PM crying her utilities were getting shut off. She had twin toddlers and couldn't let them freeze. I transferred $600 immediately. Two days later, I saw her Instagram story. She was at a spa resort with her friends, champagne glasses clinking, caption reading, self care Sunday because I deserve it. Something snapped. I've been tracking every loan in a spreadsheet since 2,019, mostly to see when she'd pay me back. Spoiler, she never did. The total was $47,000. $47,000 over 15 years. I made decent money as an engineer, but that was a down payment on a house. That was my future. I'd handed over one guilt trip at a time. I decided to stop the next time she called asking for $2,000. To fix her transmission. I said, no, the explosion was nuclear. He screamed so loud I had to hold the phone away from my ear. You selfish bastard. I've been there for you your whole life. Mom was right about you. You've always been cold. When I wouldn't budge, she hung up and immediately called our parents. Within an hour, I had five missed calls and a group text. Mom wrote, your sister is in crisis and you're playing games with money you don't even need. Dad added, we raised you better than this. Disappointing. My aunt chimed in.

I gave my name, but the staff looked confused. Sorry, your name isn't on the list. Shocked, I asked my mother. She smirked. Did you really think you were invited? Strangers aren't allowed. I smiled calmly. Then I'll live like a stranger. And I walked away. But during the ceremony, my mother's phone started ringing non stop. I was 17 when mom sent me to live with Aunt Carol in Oregon. She told the neighbours I was studying abroad, told the church I won a scholarship to some European boarding school. The truth. I was five months pregnant and starting to show. Mom made it clear. Either I got rid of it or I left. She wasn't going to let me embarrass the family. I refused. She drove me to Aunt Carol's house with two suitcases and never looked back. My daughter Lily is 6 now. Bright, funny, obsessed with dinosaurs and space. She knows every planet in order and can name 15 different species of raptors. Mom has never met her. Not once. When my sister Becca announced her engagement last year, I sent a card. Congratulations and best wishes. Nothing more. No response. I expected that. I didn't ask to be included in the wedding planning, didn't call to offer help. I knew better than to force myself into their lives. But two weeks before the wedding, everything changed. I driven to Mom's house to drop off her birthday gift. Just left it on The porch, like always. As I walked back to my car, an envelope slipped from my jacket pocket. Must have fallen when I bent down. It was a wedding invitation. Becca's cream card stock with gold lettering. I have no idea how it got there. Maybe Mom's housekeeper put it in my jacket by mistake when I hung it up. Maybe it was sitting on the porch table. Lily found it that night while I was making dinner. Mommy, what's this? So pretty. She was holding it like treasure. Her little fingers tracing the gold letters. It's just an invitation, honey. To what? I hesitated. A wedding. Her eyes lit up like a princess party. Are we going? My heart broke a little. She'd never been to a wedding. Never had a grandmother who baked cookies or a grandfather who told stories. I should have said no. Should have thrown the invitation away. But I looked at her hopeful face and couldn't do it. Yes, sweetie, we're going to a princess party. We drove three hours that Saturday morning. Lily wore her favorite purple dress with the tool skirt. I braided her hair and let her wear my pearl earrings. She talked the entire drive about what weddings were like. She'd seen them in movies. Will there be cake, mommy? And dancing? Do I get to throw flowers? Each question was a knife in my chest. The venue was beautiful. A his

Everyone at our school knew this guy. Louise was a drug dealer. He wouldn't even try to hide it because our entire school already knew who he was. Everybody loved him. However, he literally drove the principal insane. Whenever something drug related happened at school, he was always the first person they searched. The teachers all knew, the principal knew, even the cops knew who he was. However, they could never actually prove it. Every time they searched him, they'd never actually catch him with anything. I'd watch as our principal would knock on our door, interrupting our class, and without even saying a word, Louise would just stand up to let them search him out in the hall. The cops would pull him over just for existing and try to search his car, but they, too, would never catch him with anything. The administration got so frustrated, would cut the lock off his locker almost every week just to try and find his stash. He literally drove them insane. Then someone spread a rumor that Louise was hiding his stash in a locker that wasn't assigned to anybody. It spread like wildfire and not too long after our principal heard. But since there were too many lockers, our principal decided to gather all of our teachers and cut the locks off literally every locker in the school to search them. The entire time, Louise literally laughed in their faces as They spent hours look and didn't find a single thing. The administration had no idea what to do. Every time they caught another kid with something illegal at school, they'd ask where they got it. And every time, the kid would always say, I bought this from Louise. Louis actually encouraged them to say it. Yeah, tell them it was me. I don't care. So they'd search Louis again, pat him down in the hallway in front of everyone and brought cops to search his car weekly. He just let them find anything he'd ask with a smirk while they completely lost their minds. But then something happened. Over Christmas break, the principal's son asked him for a new pair of shoes for.

Plenty of men are chefs, professional chefs. They make careers out of it. He waved his hand dismissively. That's different. Those are professionals. Our son doesn't need to cook. He needs to focus on real skills. This ends now. That night, my husband threw out Hudson's cookbooks, all 12 of them. He banned Hudson from the kitchen unless it was to grab a snack. Hudson didn't argue. He just went to his room and closed the door. For three weeks, the house was silent. Hudson stopped smiling. He'd come home from school, do his homework and stare at his phone. My husband seemed satisfied. See, he's already over it. Just a phase. But I knew better. I'd find Hudson watching cooking videos on his phone with the volume off. His culinary teacher emailed asking why he'd stopped participating in class. And then one afternoon, Hudson came to me with a permission slip. There's a cooking competition at school. I want to enter. I looked at the paper. It was a big deal. Three rounds judged by actual chefs, scholarship prize for the winner. I knew what it meant. If you enter this, your father will find out. Hudson met my eyes. I know I signed the permission slip. My husband found out two days before the competition. When the school sent a confirmation email to both of us, he exploded, called Hudson into the room and told him he was forbidden from participating. It was embarrassing. It was inappropriate. People would think we raised him wrong. Hudson stood his ground. I'm going. You can't stop me. My husband's face went red. If you walk into that competition, don't bother coming back home. I stepped between them. That's enough. Hudson is competing and we're going to support him. My husband turned to me stunned. You're choosing his side. I'm choosing our son's happiness. And if you can't handle that, you can leave. Competition day arrived. My husband refused to come, stayed home fuming. Hudson walked into that venue with his head high, his chef's knife roll under his arm. 43 kids competed. Hudson made it through all three rounds. Pan seared salmon, handmade pasta, chocolate souffle, each dish better than the last. When they announced the winner, Hudson's name echoed through the hall. First place, full scholarship to a culinary summer program. The judges called him a natural talent. Parents congratulated him. Teachers praised him. Three boys from his class asked if Hudson could teach them to cook. My husband noticed the praise. He didn't apologize, but he stopped talking about women's work. He ate the dinner Hudson made that Thursday without a word.

I sent him the money. You're seriously the best, Jason said, already unboxing the console on the coffee table. My parents are sending me money next week, and I'll pay you back everything I owe. I looked at the notes app on my phone, where I'd been tracking what he owed me. You owe me for the last four months. I know, I know. He plugged the console into the TV and grabbed a controller. My dad's just being weird about transfers right now. You know how boomers are with technology. My friend Craig told me last month I needed to stop enabling him. But Jason and I had lived together since sophomore year, so we had history. Plus, our names were both on the lease, which meant if I stopped covering his half, we would both get evicted and my credit would be destroyed along with his. Next week for sure, Jason said, not looking away from the screen. I really appreciate you having my back like this. When I got home from work on Tuesday, there was an orange eviction notice taped to our door. My hands went numb as I read about how we apparently hadn't paid rent for three months. I called Jason immediately, but it went straight to voicemail. I texted him a photo of the notice with a message. What the Hell is this? Three hours later? He finally responded. It's probably just a mistake. Call the landlord tomorrow. I couldn't sleep that night. I kept pulling up my Venmo history, my bank statements, everything showing I had given Jason the money to pay rent every single month. The next morning, I drove to the landlord's office before I went to work. The property manager, Lisa, looked up from her computer when I walked in. I need to see our payment history, I said, putting the eviction notice on her desk. There has to be a mistake. She pulled up the account and turned the monitor toward me. The last payment they had received was four months ago in March. After that, there was nothing but a growing balance with late fees that now totaled over $7,000. But I paid, I said, pulling out my phone. Look, here's every payment I made to my roommate. Lisa scrolled through my Venmo history.

I was married to Julia for 22 years, and we had three kids together. I worked 60 hours a week at a warehouse while Julia stayed home. She controlled all our money because she said I was too stupid to handle it. And I believed her. But she. He was hiding something I wouldn't discover until later. She told our kids every day that I was pathetic and useless. My son started calling me the wallet instead of dad. My daughters rolled their eyes whenever I tried to talk. When I asked Julia to stop poisoning them against me, she laughed and said I was being too sensitive. At dinner, if I tried to join the conversation, Julia would say, nobody asked you. And the kids would laugh. I ended up eating alone in the garage most nights. Things got worse every year. When my father died from cancer, I broke down crying in the bathroom. Julia found me and told the kids I was faking it for attention. They mocked me for months. My son would pretend to cry and say, look, I'm dad, while the others pointed and jeered. I paid for everything, but got treated like garbage. When my daughter needed a car for college, I worked double shifts for three months to afford it. But when I offered to teach her to drive, she looked disgust, asked, and said, mom says you're too stupid to teach anyone anything. Julia laughed and Said, she's not wrong. That's when I realized how bad things had really gotten. For eight years straight, my family forgot my birthday completely. Meanwhile, Julia's birthday was this huge three day event where the kids would cook her breakfast and buy her expensive gifts with my money. They throw parties and post about their amazing mom online. On my birthdays, they would literally plan trips without me, leaving me alone in the house. But this year would be different. I turned 50, which felt like a big milestone. I made a reservation at a nice steakhouse for myself. Just a table for one. But I had other plans, too. The morning of my birthday, Julia came in all excited and announced they were going to Miami that day because her sister found cheap tickets. I knew exactly what was coming next. Reminded her it was my birthday and I had dinner plans. She laughed in my face and said, cancel it. You need to drive us to the airport. The kids started packing and cheering. My youngest daughter said, thank God Dad's not coming to ruin everything, and Julia high fived her. My son added, yeah, no dead weight on this trip. And they all laughed for the first time in years. I smiled back at them, but they didn't notice. I asked how they would get home from the airport. Julia said, you'll pick us up, obviously. Tuesday at nine PM. I loaded their bags while they complained. I was too slow. During the drive, they talked about how great their trip would be without me there. At the airport, they grabbed their bags and walked away without saying goodbye. They had no idea what was about to happen. I sat in my car at the airport for 20 minutes. I wasn't angry.

My son Hudson is obsessed with cooking. He's 14 years old and watches cooking competitions like they're the Super Bowl. He started with simple recipes, scrambled eggs and grilled cheese, and moved to stir fries and pasta dishes. When other kids his age were asking for video games for their birthdays, he wanted a chef's knife set and a cast iron skillet. I thought it was wonderful. He'd light up when he cooked, carefully chopping vegetables and tasting sauces. So when he started eighth grade, I let him take over dinner twice week. He'd plan menus, make shopping lists, and spend hours perfecting recipes. Our kitchen always smelled amazing. And his younger sister would sit at the counter watching him work like he was performing magic. His culinary teacher even called to tell me Hudson was the best student she'd had in 15 years. But then last Tuesday, my husband came home early from work. I was still at the office. Hudson was in the kitchen making chicken piccata. Flour dusted across his apron, lemon slices arranged on the cutting board. My husband walked in, saw him. I'm at the stove, and I got a text that just said, call me now. I called during my break. He was furious. Why is Hudson in the kitchen cooking like a housewife? I didn't understand the question at first because it's Tuesday and it's his night to make Dinner. My husband's voice went cold. We need to talk about this when you get home. The drive back was tense. I walked in to find Hudson sitting on the couch, arms crossed, jaw tight. The chicken piccata was still on the un touched. My husband was in the living room waiting. He didn't waste time. This cooking thing stops today. Hudson is not spending his time doing women's work. I stared at him. It's not women's work. It's just cooking. Anyone can cook. He shook his head. Men provide, women cook. That's how it's always been, and that's how it should be. Our son needs to learn skills that matter, not how to prance around a kitchen. Hudson spoke up then, his voice shaking. I like cooking. I'm good at it. My husband turned to him. You're a boy.

My sister Tessa started acting weird the moment I got engaged to David. Suddenly she needed his opinion on everything. David, which car should I buy? David, can you explain my taxes? David, what do guys really want? David would politely help, but I noticed her excuses were getting ridiculous. When David mentioned he liked hiking, Tessa bought $300 worth of gear and started posting trail photos daily. She'd tag him in every single one with captions like, wish I had a strong hiking partner. The girl had never set foot on a trail in her life then. And she joined his gym, not a gym near her apartment, his gym 40 minutes from where she lived. I'd get home from work and she'd casually mention, oh, I saw David at the gym today. He helped me with my form. She'd say it while wearing his favorite color. The breaking point came last month. She texted David at 11 p. M. Saying she heard a noise in her apartment and was scared. David, being the good guy he is, drove over immediately. When he got there, it was her cat knocking over a vase. But here's the thing, she was wearing a silk robe, her hair was done and she had wine glasses out. Since you're here, Wanna stay for a drink, she asked. David texted me immediately with A screenshot. He came home and we both agreed she'd crossed a line. But I didn't wanna cause family drama, so I decided to just keep my distance. That strategy lasted exactly three weeks. I taken the whole day off work to prepare David's favorite meal from scratch, homemade lasagna, garlic bread, Caesar salad and tiramisu. It takes hours.

To each other, we're nothing. I'm sorry, alright? Is that What you want to hear? And there it was. Apology I've been waiting for since I was 16. Only it came 16 years too late.

Bryce called melody directly to convince her to convince me I could afford the $500. Wouldn't even register in our budget. Melody and I are comfortable. But every time, I started to feel guilty. I remembered being 16. Working until closing, stressed about money while his kids lived in comfort. I remembered my mom sitting silent at that dinner table, choosing him over me.

I agreed. We met at a coffee shop the next day with her boyfriend, Trevor. 20 minutes into our conversation, Valerie grabbed both our hands across the table and squeezed hard. I think the three of us should be together, I laughed nervously. Wait, what? Valerie's face was completely serious. She squeezed harder until it hurt. I'm serious. The three of us. It's meant to be. My brain couldn't process this. This was my best friend. Trevor's polyamorous. You're what's been missing from my life. You have to say yes. I yanked my hand away. Val, I love you as a friend. That's it. I'm not interested. Her face went blank like she was a different person. Just think about it. I could barely speak. There nothing to think about. She stood up. You'll change your mind. That night at midnight, my phone lit up. Have you thought about it? I felt sick. The next morning, three more texts. I know you're scared, but we're perfect together. This is fate. I typed back, shaking. Val, I Already said, no, please stop. She responded instantly, you don't mean that. Then came the articles about polyamory, voice messages explaining why we belong together. My phone wouldn't stop buzzing. Then one night someone knocked. I opened it and Valerie there with Trevor and her face scared me. Can we please just talk about this? She pushed past me into my apartment. I felt panicked. She sat on my couch and ignored everything I've been saying. For 20 minutes, she talked about destiny and soulmates. When I got them to leave, she hugged me too long and whispered in my ear, I'll wait for you to come around. She came back the next day and knocked for 10 minutes. I watch through the people. The day after that, more knocking. I felt trapped. Then my friend Casey texted asking if Val's news was true. I went pale. Valerie was telling people I'd agreed. I had to explain she was lying. That's when Trevor started texting, hey, I'm really sorry about how Val's been acting. I told her to back off. I felt relieved, someone who understood. But his next message changed everything. But she's really struggling.

I just got sent to clean the address where my family lives. The dispatch came through at 2:00am on a Friday, which wasn't unusual. What was unusual was the address. 4 7 38 Maple Grove Lane. I stared at those numbers for a full minute, trying to convince myself I'd misread them. But the address didn't change, no matter how many times I blinked. That was my childhood home, the house where my parents still lived. I called my boss, Leonard, immediately. There's been a mistake with the dispatch. The address you sent, that's my family's house. There was a pause on the other end, the sound of papers shuffling. No mistake, Kira. Police called it in about 20 minutes ago. Standard protocol clean up. They specifically requested precision bio clean because we're discreet and thorough. My throat closed up. What happened? Is everyone okay? Leonard, tell me what happened. I don't have details beyond what's in the work order. Multiple rooms affected. Any biological matter? They need it cleaned before sunrise because apparently there's family coming in from out of state. His voice softened slightly. Look, I can send Michaels instead if you need to be with your family right now. This is obviously a conflict of interest. I should have said yes, but something in my gut told me I needed to see this myself. No, I'll take it. I'm already dressed. I can be there in 15 minutes. Leonard. Was quiet for another beat. You sure this isn't something you can unseen, Kira? And if it's your family's place, the emotional impact. Just think about it before you commit. I was already grabbing my keys, already heading for the door. I'm sure. Send me the full work order. I hung up before he could argue further. The drive to Maple Grove Lane felt both impossibly long and too short. I tried calling my mother's cell. Straight to voicemail. My father's phone, same thing. Delilah's number rang six times before going to voicemail. Her cheerful message telling me to leave my name and she'd get back to me. Nobody was answering. And that silence was worse than any explanation could have been. Pulled up to the house just after 2:00am and immediately noticed the yellow police tape across the front door. The porch light was on, casting everything in harsh yellow illumination. My father's sedan was in the driveway. My mother's SUV was parked on the street. Delilah's little compact car was tucked behind the sedan. All three vehicles present, which meant everyone should have been home. A police officer I didn't recognize was sitting in a cruiser at the curb, apparently assigned to watch the scene until I finished. I approached with my credentials ready, my company ID hanging around my neck. Officer, I'm Kira Okafor, with Precision Bio Clean. I'm here for the cleanup. The officer, a young guy who looked barely old enough to shave, checked his clipboard. And nodded. Scenes been cleared. You're good to go in. Just stay out of the master bedroom upstairs. That's still an active investigation area. My stomach dropped. The master bedroom? That was where my parents slept.

Your wife is lovely, but you won't be able to help with the wedding if you're constantly taking care of her needs. It's just one day she'll understand. Something inside me just snapped. The alcohol fog lifted completely, and I felt stone cold sober. I stood up and said very calmly, if my wife isn't invited to this wedding, then I'm not coming either. My sister's face went red. You're seriously choosing her over me? Over your own family? She is my family, I said. She's more family than any of you have been to me in years. I started walking toward the stairs to get my wife. My brothers both stood up and blocked my path. You're being ridiculous, one of them said. Just think about this. I looked at both of them and said, move right now. My sister started crying, saying I was ruining her engagement Celebration. My mom said I was being selfish and dramatic. My dad finally spoke up and said, son, maybe just sleep on it. I'm done sleeping on things, I said, I've spent eight months watching you all pretend to accept my wife while talking behind our backs. If I hear one more word about her, one more insult, I swear to god I will do something we'll all regret. Now move. They stepped side. I went upstairs, gently woke my wife up and told her we needed to leave because my boss had called with an Urgent work emergency. She was groggy, but believed me. I helped her get to the car while my entire family stood in the doorway watching us leave. On the drive home, she asked if everything was okay. I told her everything was fine. Just work stuff. She fell back asleep in the passenger seat. Since that night, my sister has sent me 47 text messages. My brothers have called me selfish, immature, and ungrateful. My mom sent me a long email about family loyalty and forgiveness. I blocked all of them this morning. My wife still doesn't know what happened. She keeps asking why we haven't heard from my family lately, and I keep making excuses. But honestly, I don't regret it. Not for a second.

I felt sick. This wasn't just my father anymore. And Adrian. He's using your situation as a cautionary tale. Tells other parents to be tough on their kids before they end up like you. He even showed people a photo of you from years ago, claiming it was recent. Said you were living in a shelter. Two months later, the development hit a construction delay. My father panicked, demanding his money back, threatening legal action. He even tried contacting the city to shut down permits. That's when he found out who owned the project. James sent me the voicemail. My father's voice was shaking. If my son finds out I invested in his company after what I said, I'll never hear the end of it. The next message was worse. James, you have to bury this. If word gets out at the club that I invested in my homeless son's company, I'm finished. I'd instructed James not to give my father special treatment. The project would pay out when it paid out. But I did tell James one thing. Make sure everyone at the country club knows exactly whose project they invested in. Three months later, my mother called. Your father made a mistake. He invested money we didn't have. We're going to lose the house. And Lily? She's in trouble, too. She invested her savings. I let the silence. We're family. You can't just abandon us. I thought About that word family. The same people who threw me out called me a failure, told their friends I was homeless while I was closing million dollar deals. Mom, you told me to go live on the streets. I did. I hung up. The project finished six months later. Every investor got their returns. My father made $50,000. Enough to keep the house. Barely. I ran into him at a coffee shop months later. He looked smaller. Tired. He didn't apologize, just stared at me. You knew when I invested, you knew it was yours. Yeah, I knew. And you didn't tell me? You told me I was a failure who should live on the streets. I figured you wouldn't want my help. There was nothing left to say. Sometimes the best revenge isn't dramatic. It's just letting people discover they were wrong about you all along.

I froze with a box cereal still in my hand. What? No, these are my daughters, I said, trying to keep my voice calm. She yanked me closer and screamed louder. Mia, Olivia, it's mommy. Tell this man to let you go. My blood went cold because she just said my daughter's names, the exact names. Mia was staring at this woman with huge confused eyes and Olivia started crying. I tried to pull away, but the woman's other hand grabbed my cart, blocking me from moving. I don't know who you are, but you need to let go of me right now, I said. And my voice came out shakier than I wanted. Other shoppers were closing in now and I heard someone say they were calling the police. And older man in a baseball cap stepped between me and the woman telling her to calm down. But she shoved past him like he wasn't even there. Look at them, she screamed, pointing at my daughters with a shaking finger. That's my Mia with the blonde hair and the birthmark on her left ankle. That's my Olivia with the brown curls in the scar above her right eyebrow from when she fell off the changing table. My stomach dropped because Mia did have a birthmark on her left ankle and Olivia did have a tiny scar above her eyebrow that my wife Vanessa always said came from bumping into the crib when she was learning to stand. How did this stranger know these things? Security is coming, the teenage employee announced from somewhere behind me. But the woman didn't seem to care. She was crying now, mascara running down her face in black streaks. I reported them missing three years ago, she said, and her voice broke. Police said they probably drowned in the lake, but I never believed it. I knew someone took them. I knew it. She reached toward Mia, who shrunk back in the shopping cart and started crying, too. I put myself between them, my hands up like I was trying to calm a wild animal. Listen, there's been a mistake, I said. My wife gave birth to both of these girls. I was there. I have birth certificates and hospital records and everything. The woman laughed, but it sounded more like choking your wife, she repeated. The way she said it made my skin crawl like when you lick a battery. Where is your wife right now? I hesitated because Vanessa was at home and sent me shopping. She's at home, I said, and immediately regretted how defensive I sounded at home, the woman repeated. She was nodding like I just confirmed something terrible. And I bet she's the one who told you their names were Mia and Olivia, I bet she's the one who knows all about their birthmarks and scars. Security arrived, then two. Guys in black polo shirts who looked barely older than the teenage employee. They positioned themselves on either side of the woman and asked what was happening. She whirled on them immediately. This man kidnapped my daughters three years ago, and I want them back right now. One of the security guards looked at me with this expression.

I got price quotes from moving companies. I bought this huge winter jacket and wore it everywhere, even though it was warm outside. When people ask why, I'd say I was breaking it in for Fargo. I'm not sure you even break in winter jackets. My roommate looked like she might cry every time. Then two weeks before graduation, the ambush came. I walked into my roommate's place and the whole friend group was there. Someone had made a slide deck presentation. It was called why Fargo is a mistake. They had slides about the weather and how far away it was from everyone. My roommate stood up at the end. We don't want you to do something you'll regret. You belong here with us. She, I looked at my ex boyfriend. With people who care about you. I let them finish. I was holding back my laughs at this point. Then I said, I'm not moving to Fargo. There was a group sigh of relief. Thank god. I knew you'd realize it was a bad idea. I shook my head, no, no, I'm moving to New York. I accepted a job there six weeks ago. The whole room went silent. You could hear someone's phone buzz and nothing else. Six weeks, my roommate whispered. She looked confused. But what about the apartment? What about your boyfriend? I kept my voice calm. We broke up three weeks ago. He told me if I took a job out of state. He'd leave me. So I pick a job. My ex boyfriend's face turned red. Everyone was staring at us. You've been broken up for three weeks, my roommate asked. I picked up my bag. I tried to tell you I was looking at other places. You. I signed a lease with my name on it and he gave me an ultimatum. Nobody asked what I wanted. Then my ex stood up. You know what? I didn't actually accept that job here. Everyone turned to look at him. I got an offer in Boston and I took it last week. My roommate's eyes widened in shock. Wait, so neither of you are staying? He shrugged. I was gonna tell everyone at graduation. She looked at me. I can't afford that apartment with three people. The deposit is gone. Then she said it. I already spent your $800 on furniture. I stopped walking. What? Her voice cracked. I thought you'd pay me back, so I bought the couch already. My ex started laughing. Not a normal laugh, a wrong one. You're both psychotic. My roommate was crying for real now, not fake cargo tears. So I just walked out. 3 days later, she Venmo requested me $800. The note said you owe me. I blocked her.

So I grabbed my wife and went back home. My wife and I have been together since we were kids. We started dating when I was 17 and she was 16. When she was 11, she was hit by a drunk driver while riding her bike home from school. The accident left her paralyzed from the waist down. We're working with specialists, trying different treatments, but the doctors aren't optimistic about her ever walking again. We got married eight months ago. It was a small ceremony with close family and friends. My family criticized me for marrying so young, said I was throwing my life away. I have two older brothers who are two years apart from each other and one older sister who's four years older than me. They all showed up to the wedding and smiled for photos, so I thought they'd accepted her. I really believed they had moved past their initial concerns. Last week, my eldest sister finally got engaged after dating her boyfriend for six years. We had a big family dinner at my parents'house to celebrate. Everyone was there, probably 20 people total. We were drinking, dancing, tell, telling embarrassing stories about my sister. It felt like old times, like we were actually a normal family. Around ten PM, my wife started getting sleepy. She can't handle alcohol at all. Like two Glasses of wine, and she's done. I carried her upstairs to one of the guest rooms and made sure she was comfortable. I kissed her forehead, turned off the lights, and went back downstairs to rejoin everyone. I was talking with my dad about his new boat when my. My sister suddenly said, completely out of nowhere, it's probably better if your wife doesn't come to the wedding. The whole room went quiet. I genuinely thought she was making some kind of joke, so I laughed and said, good one. She looked at me with this completely serious face. I'm not joking. I stopped smiling. What are you talking about? Why wouldn't she come? My sister took a sip of her wine and said, I need you to be there for me, not spending the whole day carrying her around. I want my brother by my side, not distracted. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. She's not a burden. She's family. I can be there for both of you. That's when my oldest brother chimed in, come on, man. You've done enough for her already. This is Abigail's day. She deserves to have her brother actually present. My other brother nodded. You should have married someone normal anyway. Someone who could actually be a proper wife. I looked around the room, waiting for someone to tell them how messed up they were being my dad. I just gave me this look like I should calm down and not make A scene. Then my mom actually joined in. Sweetheart, they have a point, she said in that condescending tone she uses when she

Her speech suddenly started slurring and before she could get another word out, I heard her drooling, baby. My voice was interrupted by a loud thump, her falling over. The line went dead. My heart stopped completely. Zara had been drugged. The stalker finally got to her. I grabbed my keys and ran to my car so fast I knocked over a chair. I drove like a maniac, ran every red light I saw. My mind was racing. What if he took her? What if I'm too late? I kept calling Zara's phone over and over. It went straight to voicemail every time. 14 minutes felt like 14 hours. When I finally pulled up, the music was blasting so loud I could hear it from the street. The front door was wide open with people standing outside smoking and talking like nothing was wrong. I pushed past them without saying anything. Inside, it was packed with bodies, teenagers dancing and laughing. I couldn't see Zara. My panic was taking over. I started opening every door I saw without knocking. First door, two people making out on a bed. Second door, someone throwing up. My heart was pounding harder with every empty room. Where was my Zara? I ran upstairs and tried the first bathroom door. It was locked. I pounded on it. With my fist. Anyone in there? I yelled over the music. No answer. That was weird. Why would a bathroom be locked with the lights inside it off and nobody answering? Something felt wrong. I kicked the door until the frame cracked. There I saw her, my Zara, lying on the floor, her red dress ripped at the shoulder. She was unconscious and not moving. The back bathroom window was wide open with a muddy shoe print on it. Her stalker did this, then escaped out that window. I dropped to my knees next to her. Baby. Wake up, please wake up. I checked her pulse, still breathing, thank god. I picked her up carefully and carried her down. I put her gently in my car and drove straight to the hospital. The doctors examined her and ran tests. They said she'd been drugged with opioids but would be okay. She just needed to sleep it off. Zara woke up a few hours later looking confused and scared. I held her hand and told her she was safe now. The next morning, her boyfriend, Rory, showed up at the hospital. Oh, my god. Are you okay? I was so worried about you. I watched him strokes Zara's hair gently and get her water from the pitcher he'd never been this attentive to, not even when her Lupus flared up. Where were you? I asked him. My voice came out sharp. You were at that party with her? Rory looked startled. I know. I know. I'm the worst boyfriend ever. The worst. I hate myself. I don't deserve her. He started grabbing his own hair, acting like he was trying to convince me of something. I turned to Zara. My voice got softer. You said you saw him. Did you catch his face, sweetheart? Her hands started shaking. She pulled the hospital blanket tighter. He has a mask on every time I see him following me around town. Yesterday, he had the mask again. She took.

She posted videos of us at sleepovers without permission. One day, Olivia's mom called and said Olivia couldn't be my friend anymore. She said my mom was being inappropriate and wouldn't stop filming even after being asked multiple times. I cried for weeks. My mom didn't care at all. She just said she would find me new friends for the channel. The worst part was we had zero privacy ever. My mom filmed us in the bathtub when we were younger. She tried to delete those videos later, but people had already downloaded them. They're still online somewhere and I can't do anything about it. When I got my period at 12, I begged her not to tell anyone. She made a whole video about it the same day. She showed the pads I used. She talked about my cramps. She read my text messages to my friends on camera. I wanted to die. Last year, something happened that finally made them stop. My little sister almost got kidnapped. She was walking home from school and this guy, I came up to her. He knew her full name. He knew where we lived. He knew what school she went to. He knew everything about her because my parents posted everything online. My sister didn't think he was a stranger because he knew so much about our family. She almost got in his car. A teacher saw and stopped it. Just in time, the police came to our house. I told my parents they were putting us in danger. My mom had a complete breakdown. She deleted the channel. But the damage was already done. My sister had panic attacks for months. She still can't walk anywhere alone. And my relationship with my mom is basically dead. I barely talk to her now. She keeps trying to apologize, but it doesn't fix anything.

So I moved in with my dad. Years later, my stepdad wants me to help with his retirement home bills because they wouldn't. I was working weekends at a grocery store trying to save for college. Angelo, my stepdad, called a family meeting. His kids, Anna and Bryce, sat there smirking. They got $50 and $40 weekly allowances just for existing. I worked 15 hours a week making minimum wage. Time to start paying rent. Angelo announced $300 a month. I actually laughed, thought it was a joke, but he was dead serious. Real world son, time to learn responsibility. My mom just sat there silent. That's when I knew she'd already agreed to it. Does Anna pay rent? I asked. Different situation. She doesn't have a job. She gets free money every week. That's an allowance, not income. The logic was insane. His kids got paid to exist. I had to pay to exist. I did the math that night, 300 dollars out of my 450 dollar monthly paycheck. I'd have nothing left for gas, my phone Bill, food, college savings, nothing. I'd be working just to live in a house where two other kids got paid to breathe. Meanwhile, Anna was planning her Sweet 16 party with money she didn't earn. So I called my dad. He lived 45 minutes away. We split when I was 10 but stayed close. When I told him about the rent, he went quiet. $300 from a 16 year old? Is he insane? Then pack your stuff, kid. You're coming home. Took me 2 weeks to move everything out quietly. Didn't make a scene. Just left a note on my bed. Moved in with dad. Thanks for the life lesson, Angelo. Mom called the next morning absolutely freaking out. Angelo got on the phone too. Running away proves my point about responsibility. I'm proving I don't have to put up with garbage. Make Anna pay rent. If it's such a great lesson, I hung up. Life at Dad's was completely different. No rent, just real responsibilities. Cooking three nights a week, actual chores we did together. Conversations about budgeting that didn't involve taking my money. He matched my car savings dollar for dollar, taught me to change oil, fix breaks, rebuild engines. We'd spend weekends in the garage talking about life while working on my rusted Honda Civic. He showed up at my graduation crying, said he was proud of how I turned out. Mom sent a card with $50 in it. Anna and Bryce didn't even acknowledge it. Fast forward 16 in years, I'm 32, work in it six figures, own a house, married to Melody. Dad's retired and happy. We talk multiple times a week. Then Anna calls out of nowhere. Mom and Angelo need to go into assisted living. $4,000 a month. They're attention covers half. We're thinking the four of Us kids could each chip in $500. Four kids. I said, I'm not Angelo's kid. Come on, Parker, he's getting old. Mom stressed out of her mind trying to coordinate all this. Angelo made it clear when I was 16 that I wasn't family. I was a tenant. So I left. That was 16 years ago.

I know, but you're the only one she'll listen to. Please, just come over and talk to her. Everything in me said no. Another text. I'm scared for her. She's not herself. He wanted me to go to their apartment alone while Valerie was acting like this. An hour passes. My phone buzzes. It's Trevor. My hands shake. I just got back from a work trip. I need to show you something right now. A screenshot loads. I'm staring at Valerie's text to Trevor from yesterday. She'll come around once she's at our place. We just make sure she can't leave right away. This can't be real. Trevor asked what she meant. Valerie's response makes me numb. I said, at the spare room while you were gone. I put a lock on the outside of the door. Just until she understands. More screenshots come through. Valerie asking about soundproofing. Valerie googling, how long can you keep someone before it's kidnapping? Schedule with my name. And every time slot filled with convince her I think I'm going to throw up. Trevor's text comes through. I'm packing right now. I'm leaving. Call the police, please. I'm shaking so hard. I dropped my phone twice. The operator answers and I'm talking too fast. Sending screenshots, giving Valerie's address. Officers are On their way. An hour crawls by. Officer Hayes calls. We're at the residence. The boyfriend left. The resident isn't home yet. I hold my breath. We check the spare bedroom. Long pause there. The new lock on the outside. The walls are covered in photos of you. Notebooks filled with your name. We're waiting for her to return. He calls back an hour later. We have her in custody. She came home from the hardware store. My vision blurs. What she buy? Long pause. A chain, heavy duty padlocks, and a wedding dress in your size. I ended up blocking half our friend group because they kept saying I overreacted. I still wake up freaking out most nights, thinking about what would have happened if I'd gone over there like Trevor wanted. Officer Hayes called me a week after the arrest. They'd found the receipt in her car. She bought that dress three weeks ago, the day after our coffee shop meeting. She'd been planning this from the very beginning.

I was three months from graduation when my roommate decided my entire future for me. We were at dinner and she goes, I put the deposit down for our apartment next year. Your share is $800. I stopped eating. What apartment? She laughed like I was being stupid. The one we talked about, four bedrooms on just off the main street. I already signed the lease, except we never actually talked about it. She decided in a group chat and just assumed I'd pay. Then my boyfriend decided to jump in. Perfect timing. I just accepted a job here in the city, so we're both staying. He said. We're like, it was already decided. I tried to speak, but my roommate kept talking about moving dates and furniture. Nobody asked me what I wanted. They planned my whole life and didn't ask me once what my actual plans were. So I decided to mess with them out of love, of course. So the next week at lunch, I said, I've been looking at jobs in other cities. My boyfriend laughed, you're not serious. I looked right at him. There's a really good offer in Fargo. Everyone went quiet. My roommate put her fork down. Fargo like North Dakota. I nodded. The rent is $600 for a really nice place. My boyfriend's smile disappeared, babe, stop joking around. But I wasn't joking. Well, not to them anyway. Over the next few Days I started dropping details. To make it worse, I told my roommate I've been researching winter coats because it gets to negative 30 degrees there. She looked hair. I showed everyone apartments I'd supposedly saved online. My boyfriend kept giving me these looks like he was waiting for me to admit I was kidding. Then one night he pulled me aside. If you move out of state, this doesn't work. He meant us. He meant our relationship was over if I left. I looked at him and said, and okay. Then his face went blank. Okay, what? I grabbed my coat. Okay, we're done. He started saying I was making a huge mistake and that I wasn't thinking straight, but I was thinking clearly for the first time in months. It felt refreshing to be honest. So I just left him standing there and went home. Here's the thing, though. I didn't tell anyone we broke up. I wanted to see how crazy everyone would get about Fargo and they were already going crazy. I could tell my roommate was scheming behind my back because of how shifty they were becoming whenever they were on the phone, they were planning something. So I went harder on the Fargo story.

She walked straight to my kitchen table and ran her finger across it, checking for dust. Mom always did this when she visited. It was her way of proving I was failing at life. Your sister just became the youngest VP at her firm. 90,000 salary at 26, she said, opening my refrigerator and shaking her head at the leftovers. Your brother bought his second rental property last month. Meanwhile, you're 28, eating three day old Chinese food. I just kept quiet while she listed everything wrong with my life. I'd Learned that defending myself only made these visits longer and more painful. Still doing that computer thing? She asked, making air quotes with her fingers. What mom didn't know was that two years ago, I'd sold software I created to a logistics company for $2 million. It was boring trucking software that nobody would brag about at dinner parties, but trucking companies needed it badly. I didn't buy a fancy car or a mansion like people expected. Instead, I bought a small apartment building through a property company I named after my grandmother's Maiden name. My sister actually lived in one of my buildings downtown. She paid $1,800 a month in rent that went straight to my company. She was always bragging about her apartment with a door. Poor man. And rooftop access. She had no idea I owned the whole building. My Brother's firm rented two floors in my commercial building across town, his corner office that mom loved posting photos of. I'd literally signed his lease renewal last week. After expenses, I made about $12,000 profit every month from all the properties. My family had no idea about any of this. I lived in the studio because I liked keeping things simple and small. The next morning, mom called a family meeting at my sister's apartment. She called it an intervention, and I knew this was going to be bad. He needs our help, real guidance, mom announced to my siblings. Like I was a lost cause. My sister immediately pulled out her phone. My friend needs someone for data entry. 15 an hour, but it's a. My brother offered he could live with me, sleep on my couch until he saves up. They talked about my future like I wasn't even sitting there. Community college came up first, then entry level jobs, then moving back home with mom. You need structure, a real 9 to 5, mom said. My sister nodded eagerly. And a savings account. I can teach you about investing. First he needs income. I know someone in our mail room. 12 an hour, but great benefits, my brother corrected. Maybe we could co sign a car loan so he can get to a real job, mom suggested. They spent 40 minutes planning how to fix my broken life. Trade schools got mentioned several times. Night classes came Up, too. Someone even suggested food stamps. At one point, my sister actually pulled up job listings and started reading them out loud. This one's perfect. No experience required, she said excitedly. I sat there in my own building while they planned out my minimum wage future. When I came,

My parents started filming everything when I was seven. At first I thought it was cool. We had a channel with over 500,000 people watching us. I got more toys than any other kid at school. I got to stay home from school sometimes to film special videos. Other kids would recognise me at the grocery store and ask for pictures. For a while, I actually loved it. But then I started noticing things. My mom only hugged me when the camera was recording. My dad only asked about my day when he was holding the camera. If I wanted a new toy, I had to perform for it first. Do a funny dance, pretend to be surprised, act excited, even when I wasn't. The cameras were everywhere in our house. Kitchen, living room, even our bedrooms. My mom would wake me up every single morning with a camera in my face, saying good morning to the viewers. She filmed us eating breakfast, getting ready for school, doing homework, everything. When I was 10, I realized the only place I could change clothes without worrying about cameras was the bathroom with the lights completely off. My younger sister did the same thing. We would sit in the dark bathroom just to have one private moment. And then we weren't sure if there were cameras hidden in there too. Around that time, my mental health started getting really bad. I couldn't sleep. I was anxious all the time. I wanted to talk to my mom about it, but I knew if I did, she would just film it and put it online. One time I tried anyway. I told her I was having bad thoughts and didn't want to go to school. She grabbed her phone and started recording me crying. She said the viewers would want to send me support. I never told her anything personal again. My mom also wanted to homeschool us. So she could film during the day instead of just mornings and nights. My dad talked her out of it, thank god. But school wasn't safe either. My best friend since kindergarten was a girl named Olivia. We did everything together, but my mom kept filming her without asking her parents

When I arrived, my sister Lily was on the couch with that smug look she wore when she knew something I didn't. My dad didn't let me sit down. You're 32, Adrian. This online nonsense needs to stop. Stop. Time to get a real job. I stood there in 800 dollar sneakers they thought were knockoffs, holding keys to a car they assumed I least. Lily laughed. We all know you're barely getting by living in that tiny apartment, driving that old car. It's embarrassing. My mom stepped forward. We've decided to stop enabling you. No more Sunday dinners. You need to stand on your own. I've never asked you for money, not once. The point is you're a failure, my dad snapped. You're doing so well, prove it. Go live in the streets for all I care.

Your father just invested his retirement into a development project downtown. Half a million dollars. My stomach dropped. Why are you telling me? Because it's your project. He has no idea you're the primary investor. My father had poured his life savings into my property development. He thought he was getting in on a hot deal. He had no clue the anonymous investor was me. James continued, he's been telling everyone you're a deadbeat at the country club business dinners, says you're homeless, that they kicked you out because you refused to grow up.

My parents missed my high school graduation because dad had a golf tournament. Not professional, just his regular Saturday group. Mom said she'd record it on her phone, but she forgot to charge it. My brother Jake didn't show either. He was at his girlfriend's lakehouse. When I walked across that stage, I saw empty seats where my family was supposed to be sitting. My best friend's whole family was there cheering for me, and they waved at me extra loud to fill the gap. College graduation was the same story. Mom and dad booked a trip to Florida three months before my ceremony date. I told them when it was. I sent them the invitation. The university mailed mom. Mom said, oh, honey, we already paid for the resort. You understand, right? Jake said he had to work. I found out later from his Instagram that he went to a concert that same weekend. When I got my first real job at an accounting firm, I invited everyone to a small dinner to celebrate. Just Olive Garden. Nothing fancy. Mom canceled two hours before because she wasn't feeling well, but I saw her Facebook post later that night about going to her book club. Dad said he'd come, but never showed up. Didn't call or text. Just didn't come. Jake said he'd be there, walked in 40 minutes late, ate breadsticks, then left because he had to meet Up with some friends. My piano recital when I was 16. I'd practiced for months. I played Chopin, this really complicated piece that took me forever to learn. I reserved four seats in the front row. Empty, all four. Mom texted me right before I went on stage, saying, Dad's back was hurting. Jake was at a basketball game. I played that whole piece, staring at those empty chairs. When I got promoted to senior accountant, I didn't even bother telling them at first, but my aunt found out somehow and made a big Facebook post congratulating me. Mom called and said, why didn't you tell us? Said, would you have cared? She got quiet. Then she said I was being dramatic. Then I met Ryan at a work conference. We dated for two years. He proposed at this little Italian restaurant we loved. Nothing big or flashy. Just us and the waiter who brought out champagne. I called mom the next day to tell her. She said congratulations, and then immediately started talking about how Jake's girlfriend might be pregnant and wasn't that exciting? I was on the phone for 30 minutes. She asked about my ring. Once we set a wedding date. Small ceremony, just 40 people at a garden venue outside the city. I didn't send my parents an invitation. I didn't tell Jake. I just didn't mention it. Ryan asked if I was sure. I said yes. His parents asked if my family was coming. I Said no, and they didn't push.

Cindy stops mid rant. What? You're Cindy from state? We had bio together senior year. You sat three rows behind me. I look at Amy. She never told me she knew Cindy. Amy continues, I remember you because you were always doodling hearts with your boyfriend's name in your notebook. Brandon, right? You even had his name tattooed on your wrist during spring semester. The color drains from Cindy's face. She instinctively pulls her left hand behind her back. I find my voice. Cindy, show me your wrist. That's none of your business. This is about our son. Show me your wrist. The kid suddenly pipes up, his little voice shaking. Mommy, why won't you show him Daddy Brandon's name like you showed me? Everything stops. Cindy grabs the kid's hand and starts backing away down our driveway. He doesn't understand. He's confused. But Amy's not having it. She's livid. Now you're trying to commit fraud. That's illegal. We're calling the cops. I pull out my phone and actually start dialing. That's when Cindy completely breaks down. She drops to her knees on our driveway, still holding the kid's hand and starts sobbing. The kid's crying too. Now. Confused and scared air through tears, she admits everything. Brandon got her pregnant about six months after we broke up. He took off the second she told him. She's been struggling as a single mom, barely making rent. Last month she lost her job. She saw my LinkedIn profile. A few weeks ago. I'm a software engineer now, making good money. She saw I was married, had a nice house. She thought if she showed up and played it right, made a scene, I might just pay her to go away rather than deal with the drama. She figured I wouldn't remember the exact timeline or that I'd be too scared to push back. She never expected Amy to recognize her, never expected the Brandon tattoo to come up. Amy called the police while Cindy was confessing. They showed up about 10 minutes later. Cindy's being charged with attempted fraud and extortion. CPS took the kid temporarily until they can find family members to take. The cops told us this apparently isn't even the first time she's tried this. She's hit up two other ex boyfriends in the past year with similar stories. I feel terrible for that kid. None of this is his fault. But I'm also just angry. Angry that she tried to blow up my life. Angry that she traumatized her own son. Angry that 7 years later she's still causing chaos. Amy's been incredible through all of this. I'm so grateful she was there and recognized Cindy. I don't know what would have happened if I've been alone.

What are you doing here so early? Joanna asked, annoyed. Taking my personal belongings, I said, calmly, handing the crew their instructions. I started in the living room. The guys wrapped up. The leather couch? Gone. Coffee table with the marble top? Gone. Both end tables, gone. Lamps, the entertainment center, speakers, even the damn throw pillows. All gone. Joanna's face started changing. Wait, you can't take the couch! Where are we supposed to sit? Should have thought about that before, I said, moving to the dining room. The custom walnut table went next, then all eight chairs. The China cabinet, the bar cart with all the glassware. Every single wine glass, every plate, every fork and knife. This is insane! Liam shouted. You're taking the dishes? What are we supposed to eat off of? Not my problem, I said, heading to the kitchen. The refrigerator. Mine. Bought it last year. The microwave, the toaster, the blender, the stand mixer. Every pot and pan, every utensil. I kept receipts for everything over the past five years, and my lawyer had already verified it all. By 10:00am. The bedroom was empty. Bed frame, mattress, dressers, nightstands, even the curtain rods. Joanna started crying. But I wasn't done. Bathroom? Gone. Every towel, the rainfall shower head I'd installed, the matching his and hers sinks I'd custom ordered. Office. Gone. My desk, my computer, my bookshelves. Every Single book. Even the washer and dryer from the garage. I'd bought those, too. By noon, the house was completely empty except for Joanna's clothes piled in the corner and Liam's beaten up futon he brought from his mom's basement six months ago. Oh, and a microwave his sister gave him in college that didn't even heat food evenly. They stood in that hollow shell of a house, their voices echoing off the bare walls, staring at the dust outlines where furniture used to be. You're a monster, Joanna whispered. No, I said, walking toward the door. I'm just a guy who took it. Personal belongings. Enjoy your fresh start. Last I heard from a mutual friend, they were eating takeout on the floor for three months before Liam's credit cards maxed out at IKEA. They broke up two months after that when Joanna realized a 24 year old temp worker couldn't actually afford the lifestyle she wanted. I'm in a new place now. Everything decorated exactly how I like it. Sometimes petty isn't wrong. It's just justice.

So I moved in with my dad. Years later, my stepdad wants me to help with his retirement home bills because they wouldn't. I was working weekends at a grocery store trying to save for college. Angelo, my stepdad, called a family meeting. His kids, Anna and Bryce, sat there smirking. They got $50 and $40 weekly allowances just for existing. I worked 15 hours a week making minimum wage. Time I'm to start paying rent. Angelo announced $300 a month. I actually laughed, thought it was a joke, but he was dead serious. Real world son, time to learn responsibility. My mom just sat there silent. That's when I knew she'd already agreed to it. Does Anna pay rent? I asked. Different situation. She doesn't have a job. She gets free money every week. That's an allowance, not income. The logic was insane. His kids got paid to exist. I had to pay to exist. I did the math that night, 300 dollars out of my 450 dollar monthly paycheck. I'd have nothing left for gas, my phone Bill, food, college savings, nothing. I'd be working just to live in a house where two other kids got paid to breathe. Meanwhile, Anna was planning her Sweet 16 party with money she didn't earn. So I called my dad. He lived 45 minutes away. We split when I was 10 but stayed Close. When I told him about the rent, he went quiet. $300 from a 16 year old? Is he insane? Then pack your stuff, kid. You're coming home. Took me two weeks to move everything out quietly. Didn't make a scene. Just the note on my bed. Moved in with dad. Thanks for the life lesson, Angelo. Mom called the next morning absolutely freaking out. Angelo got on the phone too. Running away proves my point about responsibility. I'm proving I don't have to put up with garbage. Make Anna pay rent. If it's such a great lesson, I hung up. Life at Dad's was completely different. No rent, just real responsibilities. Cook.

Even though it was almost evening, she took her time remove the sunglasses with theatrical precision. We need to talk, she said, her voice heavy with manufactured emotion. I took a sip of my coffee and waited. These past two weeks gave me a lot of time to think about us, she said, standing 10 feet away like she was on a stage. I'm just not sure about us anymore. I think we need to seriously consider whether this marriage is working. I nodded slowly, put up and smiled. That's interesting timing, I said calmly, because I actually signed the divorce papers this morning. They're on the kitchen table if you want to look. Her face froze completely. What? The divorce papers. I filed three days ago. All you need to do is sign. I picked up the folder from the counter. Oh, and say hi to John for me. Hope you two had a nice time in Portland. That hotel on the waterfront looked pretty fancy from the photos. The color drained from her face. How did you. How did I know? Let's see. You weren't at Rachel's in Seattle. You spent two weeks with John Mitchell from your office. Italian restaurant on night three, hiking on day five, expensive hotel on day 7. Should I keep going? She was shaking visibly. You had someone follow me? I had someone document the truth. Jack did incredible work. Got everything on camera, messages, the whole package. She tried To step forward. We can work through this. I laughed through it. You just walked in here with your little speech about not being sure about us. You wanted me to beg, didn't you? That's not how this works. What about counseling? She asked desperately. Counseling works when both people wanna fix something. You don't wanna fix us. You wanted to have your cake and eat it, too. Keep me as the stable option while you explored with John. She was crying now. Actual tears. I made a mistake. You made a choice. Every text, every lie, every moment with him. Those were decisions. I pulled out my phone. Oh, and about John. His wife Susan will be getting her own folder of evidence tomorrow morning. Figured she deserves to know what her husband's been up to. The look on her face was pure horror. You've got until the pizza gets here to pack a bag for tonight, I said, checking my delivery app. After that, we can arrange a time for you to get the rest of your things. She signed the papers nine days later without contesting anything. Susan filed for divorce immediately. John got transferred to another state. My ex wife resigned from work two weeks later. Three months later, the divorce was final. I got a place downtown, exactly how I wanted it.

You'll always be a loser, he laughed, forgetting I was the one paying for everything. So I left without paying. And then my phone exploded with 2, 7 missed calls. My brother opened the door and said, this is no place for losers. Pink balloons swayed behind him. My parents house, Sunday afternoon, kids screaming in the backyard, smell of vanilla cake. Lily's 6th birthday. My niece. I had a wrapped dollhouse in one hand, bag of presents in the other. Mom stood behind Jacob, arms crossed. Her smile died when she saw me. We don't want you here today. I blinked. What? Jacob stepped forward, smug grin spreading. Man, showing up like this, cringe. Lily doesn't even care if you're here. I looked at mom, at dad, behind them. Neither spoke, just stared at my wrinkled hoodie, my worn sneakers. They had no idea I made six figures, that Silicon Valley companies paid me more in a month than Jacob made in a year. But I didn't look successful. So why was a loser? I swallowed fine, walked to my car, put the presents in the passenger seat. Through the window I saw Lily running in her birthday dress, laughing. Jacob's words echoed. No place for losers. Then I remembered six months ago, Jacob showed up desperate. I need help. With Lily's school just temporary, I transferred $3,000 that night, no questions. And now I was a loser. I drove home. Turned my phone off, sat in silence for two days. On day three, I turned it back on, 27 missed calls, 15 voicemails, 32 texts. Mom, I don't know why you're acting like this. Jacob didn't mean it. Dad, let's be reasonable. You know how family works. Jacob, are you serious right now? Grow up. Then Kelly, Jacob's wife, I'm sorry. I didn't agree with what happened. Text it back. Why are you apologizing? Because Jacob's losing his mind. Money's tight. He was counting on you to cover the party costs. When you didn't, he flipped out. I laughed, actually laughed. For years, I've been the invisible safety net. This time I cut the strings. That evening, I drove past their house, didn't go in, just watched. Decorations gone, pink balloons deflated in the trash, banner torn through the window. Jacob pacing, shouting he's doing this on purpose. I smiled, drove away. Kelly texted that night, Jacob's out of control.

My father materialized beside her. You look different, older. It's been 5 years, people age. My mother's voice cracked. Do you have any idea how much you've hurt us? The audacity nearly made me laugh. How much I've hurt you. You can't just disappear because of some silly grudge. Silly grudge. You skipped my seventh birthday from Madison's costume fitting. You missed my high school graduation where I was valedictorian because she had a dance competition. You refused to help with my college applications but bought her a car at 16. And then when I achieved something genuinely incredible, you couldn't show up for three hours. We sent you money, my father said weakly. I didn't need money. I needed my parents. Silence stretched between us. What do you want? My mother finally asked. An apology. Fine. I'm sorry. Can we move past this now? I don't want anything from you. I stopped wanting anything five years ago. I walked away. My hands weren't shaking. My voice hadn't wavered. Uncle Robert found me later.

I gave a keynote to 1,000 women in tech about building success without a support system. The standing ovation lasted five minutes. When my father had a heart attack, he asked for me. I sent flowers with a card wishing you a speedy recovery. Professional, distant, appropriate for someone I barely knew. My mother called it heartless. Madison called me a monster on Facebook. But I'm not heartless. I'm just finally completely free. They lost a daughter who would have moved mountains to earn their pride. They lost patents with their last name attached. They lost someone extraordinary. And I gained everything. Seven years ago, they made a choice to skip my MIT graduation for a ballet recital. That didn't matter. They probably don't even remember Madison's performance that day, but I remember everything about mine. That was the day I cut them out. They just didn't realise it until much, much later. And by then, it was far too late to matter.

The salary was ridiculous. More than my parents made combined. What? They didn't know the company CEO had read my thesis. He'd flown to MIT specifically to recruit me. I threw myself into work, into Building a life where my achievements actually mattered. Five years passed. I got promoted twice. By 27, I was a senior engineer with my name on three patents. I bought an apartment overlooking Puget Sound. Then the biggest twist. My semiconductor design became the foundation for a product worth $40 million. My parents never knew because they never asked. I built a life that was entirely, completely mine. Then my cousin Derek's wedding invitation arrived.

The apology I've been waiting for since I was sixteen. Only it came 16 years too late. Only because he needed something from me. Your apology means nothing because it's not real. You're not sorry you did it. You're sorry it's biting you now. If you actually sorry, you would have reached out years ago when you didn't need anything. Your mother is going to suffer because Of your pride. My mother is going to suffer because of choices she made 16 years ago. The calls kept coming. Anna tried visiting my house. Bryce called melody directly to convince her to convince me I could afford the $500 wouldn't even register in our budget. Melody and I are comfortable. Every time I started to feel guilty, I remembered being 16, working until closing, stressed about money while his kids lived in comfort. I remembered my mom sitting silent at that dinner table, choosing him over me. They had 16 years to make this right, 16 years to apologize, to rebuild. They didn't. Not once. Last I heard, they sold the house, moved somewhere cheaper. Anna and Bryce stopped paying after realizing I wasn't budging. And me living my best life with people who actually treat me like family. Angelo wanted to teach me responsibility. He did. I just Learned who actually deserves it.

Family only. My husband agreed, honey, just go home. I smiled and called security. Please escort them out of my resort. Their faces when they saw my name on every building. And I had plans for their special day. The text came Friday. Pack casual clothes. Nothing fancy. Just family. My mother in law. Regina's message dripped with condescension. If she only knew. I'm Mira Chen, 34, owner of Sapphire Bay Resorts, worth $200 million. But my in laws thought I was a hotel receptionist. For five years, I let them believe their son Michael married beneath him. Two months earlier, I'd overheard Regina plotting. It's time Michael traded up that Jessica from his office. Her father owns half of downtown. Mira is just not our caliber. This beach trip is perfect. They didn't know the beach house Regina rented every year was mine. She'd been paying me to humiliate me in my own property. What? They also didn't know I'd hired a private investigator. Jessica and Michael had been meeting for late work sessions every Thursday for six weeks. The photos were damning. Not anymore. Friday evening, they arrived. Regina swept in like royalty. Jessica, Michael's coworker, wore designer everything. Mira, Dear. Regina smiled falsely. Help Maria with the luggage. Actually, Maria can take the afternoon off. I've arranged butler service. Regina's eyes narrowed. Who's paying for that? It's taken care of. I watched Jessica's Hand brush. Michael's the same gesture from the investigators photos. Dinner was worse. Jessica sat next to Michael, touching his arm. I sat at the far end, invisible. Mira, Regina announced the air conditioning isn't working. You work in hospitality. Go fix it. My phone buzzed. Security footage showed Regina and Amanda spiking my water with laxatives. Then a second notification. Real time footage of Michael showing Jessica the master bedroom, promising her the best view for tomorrow morning. I texted security, proceed with Protocol 17. When I returned, Regina was holding court. Really, Mira

When he turned 7, my laptop died in the middle of a huge work presentation. I've been working on it for weeks. Everything was on there. No backup because I'm an idiot. I was panicking about to pay hundreds for data recovery. My son climbed onto my lap while I was staring at the black screen. I can get it back, he said quietly, like it was no big deal. I didn't believe him, but I had nothing to lose. He, I pressed a few keys, held down some combination I'd never seen before. The screen flickered once, twice, and everything loaded. Every single file, every document, every photo, like nothing had happened. How did you do that? I asked, my hands shaking. It was sleeping too hard, he said. I just woke it up gently. You can't force computers. They don't like that. Last month, our entire house lost power during a storm. Lightning hit something nearby and fried our breaker box. The electrician came out, looked at it and shook his head. This is completely dead. It'll take days to fix, maybe a week. It's going to cost you several thousand dollars. My son walked up to the box while the electrician was writing the estimate. He stared at it for maybe a minute, just looking at all the switches. Then he reached up and flipped three switches in a specific order. Click, click, click. Every light In the house, came back on. The refrigerator hummed to life. The electrician just stood there with his mouth open. That shouldn't have worked, he said. Slowly. Those breakers were completely fried. My son shrugged. You had them in the wrong pattern. They needed to reset in order. Last week at his school science fair, he built a water filter from scratch, not from a kit with instructions. Random parts he found in our recycling bin, old bottles, coffee filters, sand from the backyard, charcoal from our grill. It cleaned dirty pond water so well you could drink it. The judges didn't believe a 2nd grader made it. They kept asking me questions, trying to figure out how much I helped, but I didn't help. I couldn't have if I tried. I barely understand how our coffee maker works. On the car ride home, I finally asked him the question I've been holding in for years. How do you know how to fix things? How do you just look at something and understand it? He looked at me like the answer was the most obvious thing in the world. Broken things are just things that forgot how to work, he said. I just remind them. I listen to what they need and I help them remember.

So I moved in with my dad. Years later, my stepdad wants me to help with his retirement home bills because they wouldn't. I was working weekends at a grocery store, trying to save for college. Angelo, my stepdad, called a family meeting. His kids, Anna and Bryce, sat there smirking. They got $50 and $40 weekly allowances just for existing. I worked 15 hours a week making minimum wage. Time to start paying rent. Angelo announced $300 a month. I actually laughed, thought it was a joke, but he was dead serious. Real world, son. Time to learn responsibility. My mom just sat there silent. That's when I knew she'd already agreed to it. Does Anna pay rent? I asked. Different situation. She doesn't have a job. She gets free money every week. That's an allowance, not income. The logic was insane. His kids got paid to exist. I had to pay to exist. I did the math that night. 300 dollars out of my 450 dollar monthly paycheck. I'd have nothing left for gas, my phone Bill, food, college, savings. Nothing. I'd be working just to live in a house where two other kids got paid to breathe. Meanwhile, Anna was planning her Sweet 16 party with money she didn't earn. So I called my dad. He lived 45 minutes away. We split when I was 10, but stayed close. When I told him about the rent, he went quiet. $300 from a 16 year old? Is he insane? Then pack your stuff, kid. You're coming home. Took me 2 weeks to move everything out quietly. Didn't make a scene. Just left a note on my bed. Moved in with dad. Thanks for the life lesson, Angelo. Mom called the next morning, absolutely freaking out. Angelo got on the phone, too. Running away proves my point about responsibility. I'm proving I don't have to put up with garbage. Make Anna pay rent. If it's such a great lesson, I hung up. Life at Dad's was completely different. No rent, just real responsibilities. Cooking three nights a week, actual chores we did together. Conversations about budgeting that didn't involve taking my money. He matched my car savings dollar for dollar. Taught me to change oil, fix brakes, rebuild engines. We'd spend weekends in the garage talking about life while working on my rusted Honda Civic. He showed up at my graduation crying. Said he was proud of how I turned out. Mom sent a card with $50 in it.

Five years of solid work. Then this director shows up, and suddenly I'm being treated like I'm incompetent. I mentioned casually, I actually work in logistics too. Just moved back to town last year for a new position. Jeffrey barely acknowledged it, was too wrapped up in his own problems. Jenny turned to me. Oh, really? What level are you at? Director level. Operation side. Jeffrey was talking to someone else who joined the group, so he only caught the end of it. He turned back. Wait, you're a director? His tone was completely snotty, like I was some director at a tiny no name company. I just smiled. Yeah, something like that. He scoffed. Well. Well, maybe you can relate, then. This director at my company is making my life hell, and I've never even met the guy. It's like he has it out for me. I let the moment hang there. Then I asked, which. Which logistics company did you say you work for? He told me. I let the silence stretch just long enough. Then I said it, calm and even. I know. I'm the Director of operations there, Jeffrey. The one you've never met. The look of disgust on his face. Wait, he stammered. You're my director? I watched it all click into place behind his eyes. The kid he tortured for four years. The loser who'd never amount to anything. I was the one controlling his career now. I seen every single performance report his manager had flagged. Every documented mistake, every issue.

Tell this man to let you go. My blood went cold because she just said my daughter's names, the exact names. Mia was staring at this woman with huge confused eyes and Olivia started crying.

How did this stranger know these things? Security is coming, the teenage employee announced from somewhere behind me. But the woman didn't seem to care. She was crying now, mascara running down her face in black streaks. I reported them missing three years ago, she said, and her voice broke. Police said they probably drowned in the lake, but I never believed it. I knew someone took them. I knew it. She reached toward Mia, who shrunk back in the shopping cart and started crying, too. I put myself between them, my hands up like I was trying to calm a wild animal. Listen, there's been a mistake, I said. My wife gave birth to both of these girls. I was there. I have birth certificates and hospital records and everything. The woman laughed, but it sounded more like choking your wife, she repeated. The way she said it made my skin crawl like when you lick a battery. Where is your wife right now? I hesitated because Vanessa was at home and send me shopping. She's at home, I said, and immediately regretted how defensive I sounded at home, the woman repeated, and she was nodding like I just confirmed something terrible. And I bet she's the one who told you their names were Mia and Olivia, I bet she's the one who knows all about their birthmarks and scars. Security arrived, then Two guys.

Julia said, you'll pick us up obviously Tuesday at nine PM I loaded their bags while they complained I was too slow during the drive.

I drove to the steakhouse and had my birthday dinner alone. When I told the waiter it was my birthday, he brought out a cake and the whole restaurant sang to me.

Was gonna divorce you after graduation. Please come back. We need you. I texted back, no. Then I blocked the number and smiled. They never forgot my birthdays.

When I scratched off that ticket in my car and saw I'd won $5 million, I sat there for an hour just staring at it and planning my next move. Get up off the floor.

No, what's funny is that this morning I won the lottery, I said, pulling Out the ticket and holding it up, his face went white before turning red. That's my money, too, because we're married, he screamed, lunging for the ticket. I stepped back toward the door.

The last sound I heard was him screaming my name as I drove away.

So I gave him his wish and acted like I don't exist around him. Growing up, my dad was obsessed with classic cars. Every weekend was about restoration, engine talk, car shows. I tried to care. I really did, but I was more into coding and gaming. My dad would look at me hunched over a laptop and sigh like I was personally disappointing him. Then the Johnsons moved in next door. Their son Derek was 17, same as me. And within a week, he and my dad were bonding over a 1967 Mustang in our garage. I'd hear them laughing, my dad explaining carbureators with more patience than he'd ever shown me. One Saturday, I walked into the garage to ask dad about college application fees. He barely glanced up. Derek, hand me that wrench. Derek smiled and passed it over. My dad clapped him on the shoulder. You're a natural kid. Wish you were mine. I froze. Derek looked uncomfortable. Dad just kept working, completely unaware of what he'd said. Or maybe he was aware and didn't care. That night at dinner, I asked about those application fees. Dad grunted, ask your mother. I'm helping Derek restore his dad's old Camaro tomorrow. It's Sunday. That's usually our day, I said quietly, for what? Watching you stare at a screen. At least Derek appreciates real skills. Mom touched my arm, but I pulled Away. Something cold settled in my chest. He wanted Derek as a son. Fine. He could have him. The morning I walked right past dad in the kitchen. No good morning, no eye contact, nothing. He frowned, you late or something? I didn't respond, just grabbed my keys and left. At dinner, he asked about my day. I stared through him like he was furniture and asked mom to pass the salt. Her eyes widened. She understood immediately. Hey, I'm talking to you, dad said. I looked at mom, can you tell the gentleman I'm not hungry anymore? And left the table. This continued for days. I became a ghost in my own house, but only to him. I laughed with mom, helped her cook, asked about her work, but dad, nothing. If he entered a room, I'd finish my.

But when she crashed it, she called the cops on me. My parents backed her up, so I gave them a gift they'll never forget. My sister Jessica is 26 but acts 16. For years, I've been her ATM, rent, credit cards, insurance. Mom always said she was a free spirit who just needed time. Dad just avoided her. So guess who fixed her? Messes? Me. It started with a text. Took your car for the weekend. You weren't using it anyway, right? My car. The one I worked overtime for, the one with monthly payments. I called immediately. What do you mean you took my car? She sighed like I was the problem. Relax, Mike, it's just for the weekend. I should have gone to my parents, but I knew their response. It's just a car. She's your sister. Stop being selfish. So I let it go. The 2:00am call came 48 hours later. Mike, I got into an accident. My stomach dropped. Are you okay? I think so, but the car is totaled. The cops are being unfair. Just tell them it's fine. Okay? I took a slow breath. No silence. Then screaming. Are you serious? After everything I've done for you, what she'd done was drain me for years. Rent, debt, car, everything. You stole my car, Jess. You crashed it. Now you want me to lie to the police? It's just Money, Michael, you can afford it. Call mom and dad. Maybe they'll take responsibility. I'm done. I hung up. The next morning, my phone exploded. Mom, your sister could have died. Dad, we raised you better than this. I ignored them all until dad showed up at my apartment. Get dressed. We're going to the hospital. No, we're not. His face went red. She's family. You don't turn your back on family. Funny how that only applies when I'm giving in. Jessica, either you help or you're out of this family. I actually laughed. Dad, I was never in it. I was just the emergency cash fund. I shut the door in his face. Two days later, the knock I wasn't expecting. 7:00am, banging at my door, two police officers. Michael Carter. My blood turned to ice. Your sister, Jessica, is claiming you stole her car, crashed it and abandoned her. At the scene, my voice went sharp. My car, the one in my name that she, he took without asking. Do you have proof of ownership? Of course I did. But that wasn't the problem. The problem was what the officer said next. She also claims you threatened her, refused to help and told her she'd regret it. My hands clenched. That's a complete lie. And you won't mind coming to the station? At the station, they showed me Jessica's statement. Pure fiction. She claimed I've been drinking, that I crashed, that I abandoned her. And at the bottom, Witnesses David and Linda Carter, parent parents, confirming Jessica's story. My own parents had signed a statement against me. I leaned back, voice deadly calm. Officer, I'd like to file my own report. He raised an eyebrow. Jessica Carter stole my vehicle. I never gave permission. I want to press charges for grand theft auto. The tables turned instantly. Within three hours, Jessica's employer called. We're conducting an internal review. Your sister listed you as a character witness. I told them everything. They thanked.

They were complaining about their landlord. My rent just went up $150. Same management company as always, though, my sister complained. Which company? My brother asked. Something with grandmother's Maiden name. They own half downtown, she said. My brother got excited. Suddenly, that company owns our office building. My boss has been trying to meet the owner for two years. Wants to negotiate our lease. My. My sister laughed. Good luck. Nobody knows who owns it. They say it's some young person who made money in tech. Mom scoffed at the idea. Probably inherited it. These kids today think they're geniuses because they got lucky once. My brother pulled up his phone. Actually, my boss researched them. The owner started with one building two years ago. Now they have six properties worth over $12 million. 12 million! My sister whispered. And they're completely anonymous. Only communicate through lawyers and managers, my brother continued. Mom shook her head in disgust. Making millions while real people work real jobs. It's shameful. I'd kill to meet them. Imagine learning from someone that successful, my sister said. Mom laughed bitterly. Successful? They're probably some spoiled brat who got lucky with computers. Not like people who work their whole lives. Comment really stung because my own mother thought what I did was shameful. My phone rang right then. I didn't recognize the number, but I answered it anyway. The voice said clearly, is this the owner? This is regarding your Counter offer on the downtown property. The room went completely dead silent. My brother just stared at me with his mouth open. Did he just say owner? I said, call me back and hung up the phone. Everyone was still staring at me. You're the owner, my brother said. It wasn't even a question. Mom's mouth opened, but nothing came out for several seconds. My sister was counting on her fingers, then gasped when she figured it out. The trucking software two years ago. But you live in a studio, mom managed to say. By choice, I said. Mom just stood there looking at the apartment. She judged five minutes ago, realizing her failure of a son, owned the building she was standing in.

My son was 5 when I caught him in the garage at 2:00am. He wasn't sleepwalking. He was building something. I flipped on the light and there he was, cross legged on the concrete floor surrounded by every remote control we owned. He taken them all apart. Batteries lined up in perfect rows, circuit boards spread out like puzzle pieces, tiny screws organized by size. What are you doing, buddy? I asked, trying not to freak out. Fixing them, he said without looking up. They talk wrong. I picked up one of the remotes. It worked fine yesterday. What do you mean they talk wrong? He shook his head, frustrated. The TV one argues with the fan one. They use different words. When I press buttons, they get confused. I thought he was just playing pretend, some weird game only kids understand. And so I carried him back to bed the next morning. Every remote worked perfectly, better than before. The TV remote that always needed new batteries lasted six more months. The DVD player remote that never connected right worked instantly every time. A week later, his teacher called. She sounded worried. Your son took apart the classroom computer during free time, she said carefully. I rushed to the school ready to apologize and pay for whatever he broke. But when I got there, the principal was, he fixed our internet, she explained. We've been waiting two weeks for the Tech guy. Your son did it in 20 minutes. At home, things got stranger. Our router stopped working one night. The little lights were all red. Before I could grab my phone, my son walked in with a screwdriver. He didn't ask permission, just opened up the router, moved something around with his tiny fingers and closed it back up. Three green lights blinked on. All good now, he said, and walked back to his toys like nothing happened. I started watching him more closely. He never read instruction manuals, never watched tutorial videos. He just look at something broken, tilt his head like he was listening to it and know exactly what was wrong. Our neighbor's car wouldn't start one Saturday morning. She was clicking the key over and over. Nothing. My son was riding his bike in the driveway. He stopped, walked over and stood there staring at the hood. Your battery cable is loose, he told her, pointing. She laughed, not mean, just surprised. How would you know that, sweetie? He pointed to a specific spot under the hood, right there, the red one. She popped it open to humor him. The cable was hanging by a thread, barely connected. She just stared.

So I'm on this train from London to Manchester for my sister's wedding tomorrow. I booked my ticket two weeks in advance because UK trains are either delayed or completely rammed and I'm not the type to leave things to chance. Got seat 23, a window with a table. Paid an extra £15 because I desperately needed somewhere quiet to work on my maid of honor speech. The wedding's tomorrow and I still haven't figured out what to say without either ugly crying in front of 150 guests or making everyone uncomfortable with weird childhood stories nobody wants to hear. I wake up at 6 a. M. To catch the 7:30 train, grab an iced coffee from Pret because I'm useless without caffeine and bored already mentally rehearsing speech lines. The carriage is absolutely packed. People standing in aisles with massive suitcases, families crammed into sections with kids on laps. General chaos everywhere. Makes me and grateful I booked ahead. I make my way down, checking seat numbers 21, 22, 23. There she is, mid 40 seconds. Woman in a navy blazer, blue light glasses, laptop open, papers everywhere, phone on a stand. She's on a work call, talking very loudly about quarterly projections and stakeholder expectations. She in 23A, my seat. I stand there hoping she'll notice me, hovering. She doesn't. Completely locked into her conversation, gesturing like a person. Can see her. I don't want to interrupt, so I wait in the aisle, holding my coffee. Five minutes pass. A guy with a giant suitcase glares at me like I'm blocking traffic on purpose. She finally hangs up. I clear my throat. Hey, sorry, but that's actually my seat. I show my ticket, pointing at 23A. She glances at it, then me, then back to her screen. I'm working, she says flatly. There are other seats. I blink. Right, but this one's mine. I booked it. I need to focus. Find somewhere else. Every seat is taken. People are literally standing. Also, her laptop bag is on 23B. She's taken two seats. I can't. The train's full. And I paid extra for this specific seat. Dramatic sigh. I have a major.

Where's our apartment? This is my apartment. The studio on the sixth floor. Video. We're supposed to be moving into a two bedroom. No, you wanted a two bedroom. I never agreed. Where's my stuff? Still at my old apartment where you left it. We're supposed to be moving in together. You moved into my apartment without asking, took over my space, then demanded I upgrade and threatened to break up. So I called your bluff. He can't do this. He stole my furniture. It's all my furniture. Purchased by me before we met. Where am I supposed to go? Figured you had a plan when you gave me that ultimatum. Maybe that backup boyfriend.

You got until the end of the month at the old place. When I turned my phone back on, 38 missed calls, 89 texts. Her messages went from, are you kidding? Cameron's more of a man than you'll ever be. Her mother Diane called days later. Aubrey finally admitted the truth about why she wanted a bigger place. Let me guess. She wanted to move Cameron in. Close. She wanted a two Bedroom so her sister Talia could move in. Talia is getting divorced. Aubrey figured you'd pay rent, she'd live free, and Talia could stay in the second bedroom. Also free. I laughed. So her plan was to make me pay for housing for three people? She saw nothing wrong with it. Said that's what boyfriends do. Apparently from TikTok. Cameron dated her for three weeks after before dumping her when she tried moving into his place without asking. According to Diane, Aubrey's bounced between two apartment shares because she keeps expecting roommates to cover her utilities. I'm living in my studio with everything exactly where I want it. Started seeing Hannah. She has her own apartment, own job, own life. Aubrey wanted more space or we were done. She got exactly what she asked for.

She continued by saying that James was so much more naturally charismatic and that it was surprising how different two brothers could be. My father looked appalled. My mother went quiet. My sister actually told Natalie that it was rude. But James. James laughed nervously and tried to change the subject. That's when I snapped. I stood up and asked Natalie directly why she'd spent months making insulting comments about me and why my brother allowed it. I told her that her observations about whether I looked like James were uninformed and, frankly, bizarre. I told her that her commentary on my professional abilities and my presence was inappropriate and that I didn't appreciate her using family gatherings as a platform to demean me. Natalie's face went red. She said I was being overly sensitive. She said she was just stating what she observed and that I clearly had some kind of inferiority complex if I was so bothered by honest feedback. She said she was only trying to help by being truthful. She turned to James and said that I was ruining the evening with my drama, that he should talk to me about my attitude. James shifted uncomfortably. He looked between us and said that maybe we should all just calm down. I asked him directly if he agreed with her, if he thought there was something wrong with how I looked or how I carried myself professionally. He didn't answer. He just said that Natalie didn't mean anything by it and that I was making a bigger deal out of this than it was. I realised in that moment that he chosen her, he chosen someone who actively disrespected his sister over maintaining a relationship with me. I walked out of that house and called him the next day. I told him that I couldn't have a relationship with him as long as Natalie was in his life and actively demeaning me. I told him that his failure to defend me said everything about his character. I gave him an ultimatum. Either he addressed her behaviour and set boundaries or I was done. He called me back two hours later and said that Natalie felt attacked and that she wasn't going to change. He said I needed to accept that this was who she was. I told him that was his choice to make, but I'd made mine. I hung up and haven't spoken to him since. My parents tried to intervene, but I was clear I would rebuild my relationship with my brother the moment he stopped allowing his girlfriend to disrespect me. Until then, he'd made his decision.

I'm 42, and I spent most of my life being invisible to my parents, while my younger brother, Matt, got treated like royalty. When he flunked out of college, they said he was finding his path. When I took a steady job, they said I'd settled too soon. The breaking point came at my daughter Emily's high school graduation. She'd earned a full scholarship to her dream university. We planned a small family dinner to celebrate. Then my mom called Kevin Honey at the graduation dinner, we think maybe it's not the best idea to make a big thing out of it. Josh just got into that private academy, and we wouldn't want to overshadow him. Maybe have a quiet Celebration later, just you and Sarah. It's what's best for the family. They wanted me to cancel my daughter's Celebration so my nephew could have the spotlight. We at the dinner anyway, without them. They didn't even send a card. Six months later, at a family barbecue, my mom asked, how's your little one doing? Settled into that small college, right? University, I corrected quietly. And, yeah, she's thriving. She was already turning back to Matt. Before I finished speaking, Sarah grabbed my hand as we drove home. Kev, you've been trying to earn their love for 40 years. I think. Think it's time you stopped. The final straw came at Thanksgiving. The entire dinner was about Matt's new business venture. When Sarah tried mentioning Emily's volunteer work, my mom smiled politely and said, that's nice, dear, before immediately turning back to Matt. Then my dad raised his glass. We're just so proud of both our boys. Matt's building something amazing. And Kevin. He paused, looking at me. Well, Kevin's always been steady, reliable. We need people like that, too. There was a chuckle around the table. I stood up. You'll never have to worry about my reliability again. We left. I haven't spoken to them since. But here's what they didn't know.

His mouth opened slightly, then closed. He looked at the floor. I pulled out my phone with shaking hands, put it on speaker and called our HR director directly, asked her to come to this address immediately and bring someone from upper management. Then I started talking. Explain the inaccessible venue, the public confrontation, the setup, the months of comments leading up to this moment. Patricia's face drained of color. This is completely unnecessary, she stammered. Her confidence cracking. This is just a misunderstanding. I was trying to encourage team participation. I didn't stop. Kept listing everything while my coworkers stood frozen. Then something shifted. People started nodding, started confirming details. Yeah, she did say that. I heard that comment, too. The meeting room thing happened multiple times. HR showed up in 18 minutes with our regional VP. They pulled Patricia aside immediately. Turns out she'd been flagged twice before at her previous district location for similar disability discrimination issues. I just kept getting shuffled around with warnings and transfers instead of actual consequences. They escorted her out of the building that same afternoon. Security guard carrying her box of desk belongings behind her. She didn't look at anyone on the way out. I got her management position three months later.

Now she wants me to pay for her kids therapy because my reaction traumatized her. My sister watched her daughter take Scissors to my 2 year old's hair and didn't stop her. I'd left Lily with her for two hours while I went to a job interview. Came back to find my baby's beautiful curls scattered on the kitchen floor. Her hair looked like someone had attacked it with garden shears. Random chunks missing, one side completely gone. Bald patches near her ears. My niece Chloe was still holding the Scissors when I walked in. My sister Janet just shrugged and said, kids will be kids. But I know exactly why this happened, because Janet had been making comments for months about how unfair it was that strangers always notice Lily. We'd go to the mall and people would stop to say how gorgeous my daughter's hair was. Those perfect golden ringlets that took two years to grow. Meanwhile, Chloe had thin, straight hair that Janet spent hundreds trying to style. She bought special shampoos, treatments, even tried extensions on an eight year old. Nothing worked. Every family gathering, relatives would fuss over Lily's curls while Chloe stood there watching. Janet would make passive aggressive comments about how some children just get lucky genes, all others have to work for beauty. She'd say it was shallow. How people obsessed over hair. Then she'd spend another $50 on hair accessories for Chloe. I never thought she'd let her jealousy go this far. After the hair incident, I took Lily straight to a salon. They had to cut it down to basically nothing to make it even. My baby looked like a different child. She kept touching her head and asking where her pretty hair went. I cried in the car while she napped in her car seat. Janet texted that night like nothing happened. Asked if we were still coming to Sunday dinner. I didn't respond. He texted again, saying I was being dramatic about hair that would grow back. Then she mentioned how Chloe felt bad and maybe I should talk to her about forgiveness. The kid who destroyed my daughter's hair needed me to make her feel better. I kept my distance for three months. Didn't go to family dinners, didn't.

My mother kept saying I was tearing the family apart over a haircut. My father said Janet was struggling as a single mom and needed support. Nobody seemed to care that she'd let her child assault mine out of jealousy. Then last week, Janet called me crying. Chloe was having behavioral problems at school. She'd cut another girl's hair during art class. The school demanded she get counseling or face suspension. Janet's insurance didn't cover therapy and she needed $3,000 for the recommended treatment program. She wanted me to pay for it. Said it was partially my fault for making such a big deal about the hair incident that Chloe now had anxiety about it. Your reaction traumatized her, Janet said she thinks she's a bad person because you won't let her see Lily anymore. This woman who watched her child attack my toddler was now blaming me for her kids problems. I asked Janet if she ever taught Chloe that cutting someone's hair without permission was wrong. She was just playing and it said you made it into something bigger. I reminded her that Chloe had specifically targeted Lily's hair after months of Janet's comments about it. You're imagining things, she said. Chloe doesn't even remember doing it. I laughed and said that was convenient. Janet got angry and said I had a good job while she struggled on minimum wage. That family helps family. That Chloe needed this therapy and I was being selfish. You can afford it, she said. You spend more than that on daycare every few months. She was right that I could afford it. I worked as a dental hygienist and had good benefits plus savings. But I wasn't going to pay for therapy caused by Janet's terrible parenting. I told her Chloe needed therapy because she had a mother who encouraged her jealousy instead of addressing it, who let her destroy things that got more attention than her, who never taught her consequences. Janet called me heartless and hung up.

Before he died 10 years ago, my mom was the trustee, the one person who should have protected his wishes. Your sister signed her paperwork three years ago. He said her daughters have already received early dispersments, roughly $10,000 each for educational enrichment. My daughters, zero. I hung up, sat in silence for a long moment. Then I called a financial advisor named Denise, who came highly recommended from a colleague. We found everything, false. Dental bills under my daughter Riley's initials for procedures that never happened. Travel reimbursements deposited into my mother's personal account at Kensington Credit Union. Over $28,000 funneled to Gwen's kids. Nothing for mine. Then we found my father's letter, sealed, marked open only if the kids fight, he'd written. If you cannot treat Connor's children the way you treat Gwen's, step aside. Do not dishonor their names. Do not dishonor mine. I filed a petition to remove her as trustee. Breach of fiduciary duty, unequal distribution, financial mismanagement. Court hearing was quiet, clinical. I presented the disbursement logs, the false bills, the letter. My father's trust consultant, Paul Martinez, testified that Dad's explicit intent was equal treatment. The judge didn't hesitate. I am granting the petition. Elaine Walker is removed as trustee effective immediately. The court will appoint a neutral fiduciary and order a forensic audit of all transactions. Mother's face went pale. Gwen texted me later, did you really have mom removed from the trust? This is going to Ruin her. You are disgusting. I didn't respond. The audit came back worse than I thought. Gwen had to repay nearly $11,000. My mom faced a civil complaint for restitution. We used the funds the way dad would have wanted. Set up Roth IRAs for Melissa and Riley took a week long trip to a remote cabin in the Smoky Mountains. No Disneyland, just us. Months passed, no forced reunions, no apologies, a silence we Learned to appreciate. My daughter stopped asking about grandma, started laughing again. Loud, free, unapologetic. The best revenge wasn't the court win or the money. It was watching them grow up knowing they were loved unconditionally, that no one could decide they were less important and get away with it.

David nodded slowly. He remembered. April 10th, I presented the project results to the executive team. Melissa wasn't invited because she'd missed the preparation meetings. I turned to face her. Last week, Melissa sent this email to David. The email appeared on screen. Melissa to David, I need to discuss Jenna's leadership style. She's taking credit for work I've done. Can we meet privately?

So one weekend when he's staying over I'm like alright, game on. My cousin is weirdly obsessed with being productive. Alarms for literally everything. Wake up at 7, breakfast at 8:15, lunch at noon. There's even one at 10:30 that says check progress. He checks his phone every 15 minutes. Can't function without his schedule. Friday night he's watching some movie and I'm like hey man, gonna head to bed. Throwing a fake yawn. He doesn't even look up. Perfect. I go to my room, but I'm not sleeping. I'm wait. Around midnight I hear him go to the bathroom. That's my move. I grab his phone off the charger. It's unlocked because he refuses to use a passcode. Same dude who thinks microwaving metal is fine if you do it fast. I pull up his alarm settings. Every single alarm. All 12. I shift forward by three hours and 20 minutes. His 7:00am alarm now goes off at 10:20. His noon reminder hits at 3:20. Everything's perfectly wrong. But that's not enough. I go deeper, turn off automatic time zone and switch to Saskatchewan, Canada. Random as hell. It's only a two hour difference, but combined with shifted alarms it creates this beautiful storm where his phone shows one time and reality shows another. Then I Remember his shoes? I collect every pair. Sneakers by the door, dress shoes in his bag, flip flops in the bathroom, gym shoes that smell like death. All six pairs go to the attic, hidden behind old Christmas boxes. I set my alarm for 9:00am because I'm not missing this. Morning comes. I'm awake at nine. Door crack to see his room. Silence. 9:30, nothing. At 10:20, his alarm goes off, but it's so late he doesn't freak out. Probably thinks it's Saturday. Around 10:45, something clicks. I hear this loud gasp. His door explodes open and he's stumbling out in boxers and one sock. Hair everywhere. He sprints to the bathroom. I hear him brushing teeth like crazy, gargling, spitting. Pure chaos. Then he runs back and I'm pressed against my door, trying not to laugh. I hear him through the wall like, how did I sleep this long? I never oversleep. Stupid phone. Then the shoe hunt starts. He's tearing his room apart, clothes flying, drawers slamming. Drops to his hands and knees. Bathroom, living room, kitchen, back to room. Checks the closet three times. I'm biting my pillow. Then I hear him frantically calling someone. Yeah, man, I have no

My instructor, Missus Palmer, pulled me aside and said I needed to get it together. I nodded and said I would, but I didn't know how. Then the second hit came. I finished my shift one Sunday and walked out to the parking lot. My car wasn't there. I stood there like an idiot holding my tips in my apron, looking around like maybe I forgot where I parked. But I knew exactly where I parked. Same spot I always used, right under the light pole. I called mom and she got real quiet. Then she said, they took it back, baby.

Without a car, I couldn't get to school. The bus didn't run early enough for my clinical shifts at the hospital. Those started at 6 in the morning and the first bus didn't come until 7. I tried getting rides from classmates, but everyone lived in different directions. I missed one clinical, then two, then three. After the third missed clinical, I got an email from the program director, due to excessive absences, you have been removed from the nursing program effective immediately. I Sat in the break room at the diner reading that email over and over. My phone screen kept going dark and I tap it to read it again. Becca texted me asking where I was, didn't answer. My mom called and I let it go to voicemail. I worked 27 days straight that month, breakfast shifts, lunch shifts. Sometimes I'd cover for other servers at dinner. My feet hurt so bad I'd soak them in ice water when I got home. I gave mom every single paycheck to help with bills. Dad was back at work but on light duty, so his paychecks were smaller. I kept my student ID in my wallet even though it didn't work anymore.

Her husband laughed. Should have fed them first. I just whispered, copy that. When the waiter returned, I stood up and said the waiter hadn't even finished pouring water when it happened. My daughters, Melissa, 10, and Riley, 8, still in their grass stained soccer uniforms from practice looked down at those cheap paper napkins, then up at me with confused, wounded eyes. Across the table, my sister Gwen's girls unwrapped their pre ordered gold foil boxes from some boutique Italian place downtown. Perfectly portioned pasta, slices of tiramisu stacked like edible towers. This wasn't new. Gwen, 38, has been the golden child since birth. She married well, lives in a four bedroom suburban house with a dog that gets Christmas presents from my parents while my daughter still wait for birthday cards. Hope left the building years ago, but this dinner crossed a line I didn't know existed. Halfway through the meal, my mom leaned toward Gwen. Should we tell them? She asked with a sly smile. My stomach flipped. My wife Paige's hand tightened around her fork. We're taking the girls to Disneyland this fall, Gwen beamed. Surprise trip, just the four of us. Paige straightened in her seat. You're taking your girls? Gwen shrugged like it was nothing. Yeah, mom and I planned it last week. Flights are already booked. Stared at My mom, you planned a family vacation and didn't even tell us. It's not a family vacation, she laughed. It's a treat for the girls. Our girls are your granddaughters, too, page said. Voice suddenly ice. I'm sure they'll get to go someday. My mom waved her hand dismissively. It's not a big deal. Melissa looked down at her lap, her small hands folding and refolding her napkin. Kylie blinked rapidly, trying not to cry. I stood up without a word, walked outside into the cold night air. Hands shaking, my chest felt hollow. That's when I realized I've been waiting my whole life for this family to change. They never would. And my daughters were learning the same painful lesson I'd Learned as a kid. So I stopped waiting. Three weeks later, I got a call from my father's old lawyer named Gerald.

My side startup took off the next day. My boss called an urgent board meeting and said, we own your code, sweetheart. I handed his lawyer my original offer letter. He read one line, turned white. The lead investor stood up and said, we're done here. Okay, buckle up because this actually happened to me last month and I'm still processing it. For context, I'm Emma, 29, software developer at a tech company in Seattle. I've been there for six years. In that time, I watched guys like Tyler get promoted for basically just showing up. Tyler once crashed our entire system because he didn't understand version control and somehow got a 15 thousand dollar bonus. Meanwhile, I built the architecture for our biggest project. I trained every new developer. I stayed until midnight fixing code before demos. My reward? A 25 dollar target gift card. And my boss Mark telling me, budgets tight right now, champ. After the third year of we'll talk about your promotion next quarter, I stopped being angry and started being strategic. I had this idea for an A I. Workflow tool. Started coding it at home on my personal laptop at 5:00am before work. Used coffee shop W I F. I worked on it every weekend completely separate from my job. I knew they'd try to claim it if they found out, so I dug out my original offer letter from Six years ago, page 4, section 8.2. Employee retains full rights to any intellectual property created independently on personal time, using personal resources. I printed that page. I highlighted it in yellow and kept it in a folder at home. Fast forward eight months. My tool Phoenix was actually working. A healthcare startup wanted to do a pilot test. Two weeks later, they offered me a licensing deal. I didn't tell anyone at work. Then yesterday morning, I get a Slack. Conference room B, 10:00am. Urgent. I walk in, and it's Mark. Two board members and their lawyer. Actual lawyer Mark, sitting there looking smug. Emma, we've become aware of your side project. The lawyer slides a paper across the table.

I've used a chair since college after a diving accident left me with incomplete spinal cord damage. I can stand for short periods, walk maybe 10 feet on good days, but it's unpredictable and draining. Most people get it after one explanation. My new manager, Patricia, did not. It started with comments. Oh, you're standing today. When I'd reach for files on higher shelves. I saw you walk to the bathroom earlier. With this knowing tone like she'd caught me in some elaborate lie. I tried explaining ambulatory wheelchair users to her multiple times, how disability isn't all or nothing, how bodies are complicated. She'd just nod with this tight smile that screamed she thought I was scamming the system. Then the meeting started happening in rooms without elevator access. First time, I figured, honest mistake. Second time, I knew better. Third time, she looked me dead in the eye when I couldn't attend. But I've seen you walk before, she announced to the entire team in the hallway. I started documenting everything, every email, every comment, time stamps and witnesses during our quarterly review. She closed the door and her tone shifted completely. Told me the company was concerned about accommodation fraud and that ambulatory wheelchair users were essentially lying about their real limitations to get special treatment. The air felt thin. This wasn't ignorance or lack of Education anymore. This was deliberate. This was personal. I reported it to HR. The next day. They said they'd look into it and scheduled a meeting for three weeks out, three weeks of still reporting to her every single day. The following week, Patricia announced a mandatory team building event at an escape room facility downtown. The second she said it, I asked about accessibility. She got this smile, this cold, satisfied smile that made my skin crawl. It'll be a perfect opportunity for you to prove you actually need all these accommodations you keep requesting. Several co workers looked uncomfortable. A few exchanged glances. Nobody said a word. Day of the event, I pulled up to the address she'd sent. Old converted building, charming brick exterior. And the escape room was on the third floor. No elevator anywhere, just a narrow staircase with worn wooden steps. I sat in my car for five minutes gripping the steering wheel, debating whether to just drive home and call in sick. But I was exhausted, exhausted from proving myself, from defending my own body, from being treated like a con artist.

I was 19 when I finally got into the nursing program at community college. Third time taking that entrance exam. First two times I bombed it so bad I didn't even wanna look at the scores. But that third time I passed. Barely, but I passed. My parents threw me this little party at our apartment, just pizza and a cake from the grocery store. But my dad kept hugging me and my mom cried. They don't have much money. Dad works at a warehouse loading trucks and mom cleans offices at night. But they surprised me by giving me $800. They've been saving for your first semester, dad said. I literally sobbed. I bought this beaten up laptop from some guy on Facebook Marketplace for $200. Screen had a crack in the corner, but it worked. I got my textbooks from the library and made copies of the important pages. My friend Becca gave me her old scrubs from when she was in the program. They were too big, but I didn't care. Those first two weeks were amazing. I loved my classes. I loved learning about the human body and how to help people. I'd come home from my shifts at the diner smelling like grease and study until midnight. I stopped hanging out with my friends on weekends, stop scrolling TikTok. I just studied. Then everything fell apart. Dad got hurt at work. A steel beam fell on His foot and crushed three of his toes. I remember mom calling me during my anatomy class, her voice shaking. I left in the middle of lecture and drove to the hospital. Dad's foot was wrapped in so much gauze it looked like a white club. The doctor said he'd be out of work for at least three months, maybe longer. Dad just kept apologizing to me. I'm sorry, Mija. I'm so sorry. Like it was his fault a beam fell on him. Mom started working double shifts, picked up every weekend shift I could get at the diner. My manager, Rick, was cool about it. He gave me the breakfast shifts because tips were better. I'd work 7 to 3 on Saturdays and Sundays, then try to study when I got home, but I was so tired I'd fall asleep with my face in my textbook. My grades started dropping. I failed my first farm.

You never leave your apartment dark for that long, even when you're sleeping. She drove four hours to my place, broke down my door and dragged me outside before calling 911. The doctor had already told me another hour and I'd have been dead. My brain would have shut down completely. I know you think I'm crazy, she said, her voice cracking, but you're all I have left. I didn't understand. We had aunts, uncles, cousins. Our family wasn't small. That's when she pulled out an old photo from her wallet, worn at the edges, folded and unfolded a thousand times. Me, her and our parents. We looked so young, maybe 6 or 7 years old. I've never seen it before. This was taken the day before the crash, she whispered. The day before what crash? My mind was blank. You don't remember, she said. Tears spilling over. The doctor said you might not. You hit your head pretty hard, had a concussion. You were in the hospital for weeks. She took a shaky breath. Mom and dad were driving us to the beach for your birthday. You got car sick before we even left town, started throwing up in the backseat. You begged me to stay home with you. Said you didn't wanna go anymore. I didn't wanna stay. I was so excited about the beach. But you were crying. And mom said one of Us should stay with grandma. Her hands were shaking now. So I stayed and they left. And three hours later, a drunk driver crossed the center line on the highway. I've spent 15 years making sure I never lose you the same way she said. I know what's wrong. I know I'm suffocating you, but every time you don't answer your phone, every time you go somewhere without telling me, all I see is that police officer at our door. I reached for her hand. For the first time in my life, I understood she wasn't crazy. She was just terrified and she'd saved my life.

Within the first hour, I proved she wasn't. I found out about their experiment in the most mundane way possible, her phone buzzing on the kitchen counter while she was in the shower. The screen lit up with a group chat called Girl Support Squad. Day 1 starts tomorrow. Remember, no intimacy. Create conflicts. Test his patience. If he fails any part, you know what to do. I picked up that phone and read every message. Three divorced women had convinced my wife that our five year marriage needed a compatibility test. They'd outlined a seven day plan. Deny intimacy, pick fights over nothing, compare me to other men, test my financial boundaries, make me prove I deserved her. The final message made my jaw clench. Trust us. If he's really worth it, he'll fight for you. If not, better to know now before you waste more time. When he walked into the kitchen 20 minutes later, I was sitting at the table with her phone face up between us. We need to talk. She glanced at the phone. Color drained from her face. It's not what you think. It's exactly what I think. You and your divorced friends decided I need to prove I'm worth keeping. Here's what's going to happen. You have 24 hours to decide if you want to be married to me or play games with your support group because I Don't do tests. I don't jump through hoops. And I sure as hell don't prove my worth to someone who should already know it. That's not fair. Fair would have been coming to me directly. Fair would have been an adult conversation instead of plotting with women who can't maintain their own marriages. Her face flushed. Their, my friends, they're saboteurs. Call them right now. Tell them the test is off or don't. But if you choose their advice over our marriage, you're choosing to end it. You can't give me ultimatums. I'm giving you clarity. You want to test if I'm worth keeping. I just realized I should be testing if you're worth keeping. And so far, results aren't looking good. Her phone buzzed. Another message from the squad, 24 hours, choose wisely. She never chose. So I chose for both of us. Next morning, I moved my clothes to the guest room and transferred half our joint account into my personal account. Canceled her credit card attached to my account. You can't do that. I absolutely can. While you were planning psychological warfare, I was getting advice from my lawyer. Her phone buzzed constantly. The support squad wanted updates.

One time I went hiking with friends, came back to 43 missed calls and a police wellness check at my door because I've been unreachable for five hours. My friends started avoiding me. My girlfriend broke up with me because my sister kept messaging her, asking about my whereabouts, my mood, whether I was eating enough. Your sister's not normal, she said on her way out. And you let her control your entire life. I thought she was insane, told her she needed therapy, begged her to just back off, give me space to breathe. She'd always promised to do better.

Felt like I could finally breathe. Then last Tuesday, I woke up in a hospital, fluorescent lights beeping, machines, tubes in my arms. My head felt like someone had stuffed it with cotton. A nurse noticed I was awake and immediately called for the doctor. Welcome back, the doctor said, checking my vitals. You've been unconscious for nine days. Nine days. Carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty heater. And in your building, he explained, your landlord had been ignoring complaints for months. You're very lucky to be alive. Lucky. I didn't feel lucky. I felt confused and terrified. How did you find me? I asked. The doctor glanced toward the door. Your sister? She's been here every single day. My stomach dropped. Walked in a moment later, looking smaller than I'd ever seen her. Dark circles under her eyes, hair pulled back in a messy knot. She'd clearly been wearing the same clothes for days. Hey, she quietly sitting in the chair beside my bed. I wanted to be angry, wanted to scream at her for probably tracking me somehow, for invading my privacy, even after I'd cut her off. But I was too weak. How did you know? I finally asked. She looked down at her hands. I hid a camera inside your smoke detector, the one mounted on the ceiling near your Kitchen, you never checked that one? Of course she did.

Someone actually started clapping when I finished. Within a few days, people started bringing others over to watch and making bets on how long my routine would take. Later that week, Janet sent another email saying certain employees were abusing shared resources with unnecessary theatrical displays and that she'd already spoken to management about. I responded by bringing a small folding table the next morning to lay out my supplies, plus a digital timer that beeped loudly after each step. A couple days after that, my manager pulled me aside in the hallway and asked if everything was okay. I pulled out my phone and showed him Janet's original email. He read it, looked at me, sighed deeply and told me to just try not to take too long at the sink. That afternoon, Janet saw us talking and her expression went dark. By the second week, I was wiping down the counter, inspecting the soap bottle and applying hand sanitizer three separate times. Janet stopped coming to the kitchen entirely when I was there, but I could see her watching me through the doorway every single morning with her jaw tight and her hands visibly shaking. On day 16, I was running the water to begin my routine when Janet came storming through the doorway and shoved past three people to get right in my face. You're a manipulative psychopath, she screamed. You're making A mockery of everything I said and wasting company resources to feed your own pathetic ego. I stood there calmly with my gloves on and asked her very quietly if she felt I wasn't taking contamination seriously enough. She ripped the mug from my hand and slammed it against the counter edge with shocking force. The crack echoed through the room and ceramic shards exploded across the floor. You disgusting plague rat, she screamed. You orchestrated this whole thing to humiliate me in front of everyone. Management is protecting you because they think it's funny watching me suffer. Nobody in this building has any respect for professional standards anymore. Her whole body was shaking and the kitchen went dead silent with at least 12 people standing frozen with their mouths open. One of the senior managers stepped forward and, and in a calm voice that Janet needed to come with him to his office immediately. Janet's face drained of all colour when she looked around and realised how many people had just watched her complete meltdown. She glanced down at the broken ceramic on the floor, then around at all the faces staring at her in shock and walked out without making eye contact with anyone. I picked up the two pieces of my mug and threw them away. Janet got a formal warning for destroying property and creating a hostile work environment. When she transferred to a different floor, I went back to rinsing my mug like a normal Person

He started with typical jokes about childhood stories that made everyone laugh. Then I stood up and took the microphone from his hand. Thanks, miles, but I'd like to say a few words first. I turned to face the 200 guests. My parents, Bella's parents, our grandparents, everyone we loved. I wanna thank everyone for being here today. And I especially wanna thank my best man, miles, for going above and beyond. Miles, you really gave Bella something special last night. The room went quiet. A few confused laughs. Bella looked tense, her face filled with shame. Miles mouth opened, but no sound came out. I came home early from my bachelor party last night and found miles and Bella together in our bed. That's why he missed the party. He wasn't sick with food poisoning. Gasps filled the ballroom. Bella started crying immediately. Miles stood up trying to speak, but I kept going. The best part? I recorded them talking after. Let me share it. I pulled out my phone, connected it to the then you sound system. Bella's voice filled the speakers. We should tell him tomorrow, after the wedding. Miles. His voice no, let's wait a few months. Let him enjoy the honeymoon at least. Bella's voice again. I feel terrible, but I can't help it. I've wanted you for so long. The recording played for 30 seconds of them discussing their betrayal, planning to deceive me further. Bella's mother screamed. Miles, his girlfriend, who'd flown in from Seattle, started sobbing. My mom just stared at Bella with a look I'd never seen before. So thanks again, miles. Thanks for being such a great best friend. I set down the microphone and walked out of my own wedding reception. I didn't even look behind me. All I heard as I walked away was the sound of 200 people processing the bomb I just dropped. That was eight months ago. I'm talking to someone else now. Someone better. Sometimes the best revenge isn't getting even. It's walking away from people who were never worth your loyalty in the first place. I don't regret a single second of that speech.

So I announced it during my best man speech. Miles had been my best friend since we were 6 years old. We'd grown up three houses apart, shared every major moment of our lives, and he was supposed to be standing next to me as my best man. He was the guy everyone loved, charismatic, funny, the life of every party. Bella was my fiance of four years, the woman I've been planning to spend my life with. She was sweet, caring, the girl who volunteered at animal shelters and cried during romantic movies. And I was the idiot who trusted both of them completely. Miles and I had been inseparable since first grade. Same little team, same college roommates for three years. He was the brother I never had. When I met Bella junior year, miles was the first person I told. He helped me plan our first date and was there when I bought the engagement ring two years later. He seemed genuinely happy for me, but there were signs. The way Bella laughed too hard at Miles's jokes, how she'd mention him constantly. That kitchen hug during a party, she said, was nothing. Miles had told me once drunk at 2:00am that he wished he'd met Bella first. I laughed it off. Planning the wedding had been stressful. Bella wanted everything perfect for 200 guests. My parents contributed $15,000. Her parents put in $20,000 and we'd saved another $10,000. Miles flew in three days early to help with last minute preparations, staying on our couch. Bella stayed with her parents to keep. The night before the wedding, I had my bachelor party. Miles texted an hour before saying he had food poisoning and needed to stay home. I told him to rest. I left the party early around ten PM to be well rested. When I got home, I heard sounds from our bedroom. Then I heard Bella's voice, then Miles's voice, clearly not sick. My best friend had faked being sick to sleep with my fiance in my bed the night before my wedding. I didn't burst in. I pulled out my phone and recorded everything. Audio of them talking after. I was saying we should tell him tomorrow after the wedding. Miles responding, no, let's wait a few months. Let him enjoy the honeymoon. At least they were going to let me marry her then destroy me later. I went to a hotel, sat in the dark listening to that recording on repeat. I could have cancelled everything, but $45,000 had been spent, 200 people traveled here and yet the main reason was that I wanted them to face what they've done. I wanted everyone who loved them to see exactly who they were. The next morning I showed up like nothing happened, smiled through photos. Miles stood next to me, patted my shoulder, whispered, feeling way Better brother. Sorry I missed last night. I said my vows. I watched Bella say hers, promising to be faithful, to love me forever. Everyone cheered. We went through the motions of the reception, the first dance, cutting the cake. The whole time, all I could think of was the scene I had walked into.

My therapist fell asleep during our session. Full on snoring with his mouth wide open while I was talking about my divorce. I sat there frozen for two minutes watching him sleep before I grabbed my stuff and left. I found him on some discount directory. Forty bucks a session. Took my insurance. Evening appointments. His office was in a strip mall between a nail salon and a vape shop, blasting Bob Marley. Waiting room had three chairs, one with duct tape and people magazines from 2019. First session seemed fine. Asked standard questions about my childhood and marriage. Took notes on a yellow pad. Second session he was chugging Red Bull and checking his phone every few minutes. Third session he walked in 18 minutes late, wearing the same wrinkled shirt from last week with a coffee stain on it. But I kept coming because starting over and explaining everything again felt exhausting. Session four changed everything. I was describing walking in on my ex, spent with my younger sister in our bed. Really painful stuff. Going through the cheap, scratchy tissues on his desk. I looked up and his eyes were shut. Figured maybe he was concentrating. Then I heard a derattling snore. Head leaning back, mouth hanging open, completely out. I said his name. Nothing. That it? Louder. Still nothing. I sat there 90 seconds staring, mascara streaking down my face, watching my therapist sleep during my breakdown. Part of me Wanted to throw the tissue box at him. Instead I stood up, grabbed my purse and walked out. His secretary was in the lobby with AirPods and scrolling TikTok. Didn't even look up. Drove home squeezing the wheel so tight my hands hurt. Started writing the angry Google review in my head. Thought about reporting him to the licensing board. Got home and there was a voicemail time stamped six minutes after I left. He was crying on it. Actually sobbing like a child. His nine year old daughter was in the ICU at Children's Hospital with bacterial meningitis. Been awake at her bedside fifty two straight hours watching her hooked up to breathing machines and IV drips. Dragged himself to work because he had six clients scheduled and his family desperately needed the copay money. His wife had quit her job to stay at the hospital full time. They were barely scraping by. Didn't even realize I left. Just woke up to an empty room. The voicemail was four full minutes long. He apologized eleven times, already refunded my copay. Gave me three other therapist names he respected. Voice kept cracking every few words. I listened three times in my car. Kept picturing him waking up to nobody there. His daughter fighting for her life two miles away. Still beating himself up over disappointing a patient he barely knew. His daughter pulled through after nine days. I know because I sent flowers to the pediatric ICU car.

Everyone probably thought I was going to say goodbye, but instead I picked up his supposedly dead hand. I lifted his own hand to his face and started doing that thing where you make someone hit themselves while saying in my most annoying little brother voice, why are you hitting yourself, Nate? Stop hitting yourself. Everyone gasped in absolute horror and my mom screamed, what is wrong with you? But I kept going because I knew he was faking. Come on, Nate, stop hitting yourself. All you have to do is stop hitting yourself. Why won't you stop hitting yourself? His eyes started twitching and his jaw clenched. I can see him trying so hard not to react, but I just kept slapping him with his own hand until finally he grabbed my wrist and shot up screaming, I will end you. Everyone at the funeral absolutely lost their minds when my dead brother sat up in his coffin and started trying to strangle me. My grandma threw her purse at him and screamed zombie before running straight into a wall and knocking herself out cold. My uncle started recording but dropped his phone in the holy water while backing away and yelling, the power of Christ compels you. Everyone else stampeded toward the exits, knocking over flower arrangements and stepping on each other like it was Black Friday at Walmart. In the 2, Nate was climbing out of the casket yelling. I can explain. My mom tried to fake faint for sympathy, but nobody caught her. So she just kind of laid there on the floor pretending to be unconscious while obviously peeking through one eye. Nate chased me around the funeral home screaming about how I ruined everything while the funeral director just stood there in complete shock. The funeral director called the cops, the insurance company and probably his therapist. It turns out my mom was in on the whole thing and they were going to split the life insurance money and move to another country. They're both getting charged with fraud and I'm getting uninvited from Christmas for the next decade. But watching my brother rise from the dead just to try to murder me was honestly the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life.

I heard her moving around behind me, opening drawers and getting things ready. She took a deep breath. Okay, let's get started. Then I felt something cold and vibrating press against the top of my head. I looked up from my phone at the mirror and watched a huge stripe of bare scalp of here where my hair used to be. I screamed and dropped my phone. What are you doing? She jumped back with electric clippers buzzing in her hand. I'm shaving your head like you asked. I grabbed my head where I could feel cold air on my scalp. I wanted bangs. Just bangs. Her face went completely white. You're not Rebecca, the woman doing the cancer fundraiser. We both started yelling. The receptionist ran over, freaking out. Apparently, Rebecca had canceled her appointment last minute to shave her head for charity. And nobody. He told the hairdresser, we have the same first name. The hairdresser kept saying, oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! While I stared at my reflection in horror. There was a massive bald stripe right down the center of my head. The hairdresser started hyperventilating. We can't leave it like this. We have to finish or you'll look insane. I sat there sobbing while she shaved the rest of my head. Six years of growth gone in 10 minutes. The manager came out offering to comp everything and giving me free products I didn't want.

I drove home crying so hard, I had to pull over twice. When I got to my apartment, my boyfriend opened the door and his face went completely white. Oh, my god, what happened? Are you sick? I explained the whole nightmare through sobs. He pulled out his phone and looked up the salon, then the hairdresser's name. He found her Instagram, and his face changed. He turn the phone toward me, and there she was in dozens of photos with my ex boyfriend. The ex boyfriend who told me he'd make me regret leaving him. My boyfriend looked at me.

I sat down in the chair, and the hairdresser walked over. She looked at my hair with this intense, emotional expression and put her hand over her heart. Wow, you are so brave for doing this. I laughed awkwardly because that seemed like a weird thing to say about bangs. She asked if I was ready for a big change, and I said yes, assuming we were talking about the same thing. She got tears in her eyes. Actual tears. I just want you to know that you're an inspiration. I had no idea what to say to that, so I just smiled and pulled out my phone to check my messages. She kept talking while she moved around behind me. You're going to feel so free after this. No light. It's really a beautiful thing you're doing.

My phone buzzed again. My boss wanted to know if I'd finished the presentation for our meeting on Thursday. I opened my email and started scrolling through the slides I needed to review. The hairdresser kept making small talk while she ran her fingers through my hair. Do you have a good support system? Family and friends who are there for you? I glanced up briefly. Oh, yeah, my family is great. She nodded like I'd said something profound. That's so important, you're going to need people around you. I had no idea what she meant by that, but I was distracted by another text from my sister. She'd sent seven bridesmaid dress options, and they were all hideous.

My dad started drinking again and everyone started treating Nate like he had paper skin and glass bones. He kept saying he only had 3 months to live and started this whole bucket list thing where we all had to spend quality time I'm with him before he died, which mostly involved us taking him to dinner and paying for his meals. I started getting these weird feelings that something was off, but everyone said I was just in denial about losing my brother. I, I saw that Nate ordered camping gear on Amazon when he was supposed to be bedridden. But my mom said he probably ordered it before he got sick and forgot to cancel.

When that didn't work, he tried to tell me he was there for physical therapy, but he was lifting weights and drinking a protein shake. I tried to tell my family, but they said that sometimes sick people get random bursts of energy and I shouldn't judge how he spends his final days. My mom Was also crying all the time, but I swear sometimes it seemed fake. When I mentioned it to my aunt, she said grief makes people act strange and I needed therapy. My cousin told me I was being cruel and that I would regret doubting everyone when Nate was actually gone. Everyone kept telling me I was losing it and maybe they were right.

The whole party was silent and Jake starts doing what he always does, arguing that those comments were taken out of context and He didn't mean it like that. I said, oh, so now you want to argue about your own words. Cool. Let me read the other 70 corrections you made this week. No. 1, Monday morning, you said my coffee order was wrong and I should get Americano instead. No. 2, Monday afternoon, you explain that my favorite color isn't actually purple, it's lavender. Number three, he tries to interrupt, saying this is ridiculous and embarrassing. I said, what's embarrassing is dating someone who thinks his girlfriend is wrong about literally everything, including her own favorite color. You know what you're right about, though? We're not compatible. I'm breaking up with you. He immediately starts arguing that I can't break up with him at his friend's party and that's not how relationships work and we need to discuss this. I said, oh, now you wanna discuss something instead of just telling me I'm wrong. Too late. Don't worry. I'm sure you'll find someone else to correct, maybe someone who doesn't know what color they like or when they're hungry or how many birds they saw. Good luck with that. Tom actually started clapping and goes, finally, someone shut him up. He does this to everyone. Jake tried to follow me out, still arguing about why I was overreacting and making a mistake. I said, you're right. It was a mistake dating. You see, I can admit when I'm wrong, can you?

Each square had a memory attached. Took me four months, but I also bought a cheap seventy dollar bracelet from the mall. Gave her the quilt first, and she does her usual oh, that's sweet, honey, and sets it on the floor by her chair. Then I give her the bracelet in a fancy box and suddenly she's excited, showing everyone, going on about how I finally understood what she wanted. I said, mom, the quilt took me four months. The bracelet took me four minutes. Which one do you think has more thought? She goes red and says, well, it's not about time, it's about the gesture. I said, then where are all my gestures from the past 10 years? Everyone at the party gets quiet, and Jason tries to change the subject, but I'm not done. The scrapbook is under tax papers, the blanket is in the garage, the painting is behind garbage in the guest room. The cookbook is in the basement. But Jason's vase you hate is on the mantle. Emma's purse you never use is displayed on a shelf. Every expensive thing they buy gets showcased, while everything I make gets hidden. My aunt goes, is this true? And starts walking around the house, finding my gifts in closets and corners and forgotten spaces. Pulls out the portrait from the guest room and goes, you painted this? This is beautiful. Why is it hidden? My mom starts making excuses about not having the right space or waiting for the perfect spot, but my grandmother cuts her off. You display that hideous vase, but hide a hand painted portrait of our family home? What's wrong with you? My cousin finds a ceramic dish I made in a pottery class being used to hold screws in the garage, while Emma's store bought China is in the display cabinet. Mom starts crying, saying we're ganging up on her, but grandmother goes, you're crying because you got caught, not because you feel bad. I said, keep the bracelet, mom. It's more your style anyway. Everything else I'm taking back, since you clearly don't want them. Spent the rest of the party collecting every single handmade gift from their hiding spots. Grandmother helped me pack everything and said, next time just get her a gift card, since that's all she values anyway.

I cut her off and say nope. You want everyone included, you make it happen. Then I hung up. Here's where I probably took it too far. I was curious so I looked her up on Facebook. Her profile was completely public. Post about her classroom, pictures of her house, the whole thing. Her address was literally in her bio because she had some teacher wishlist thing linked. Took me maybe two minutes to find it. I screenshot her profile and send her an email. I write out this fake message like I'm sending it to the class parent group chat. It says something like Lorna has graciously offered to host Sam's 9th birthday party at her home this Saturday at two PM. Please RSVP and I include her actual address. Then I'm like how does this email sound? I wasn't actually going to send it to anyone else, I just wanted her to see how ridiculous she was being. But I guess the tone didn't come across because she immediately emails back in all caps telling me do not send that and that I can do whatever I want for the birthday. She doesn't care anymore. The next day, Sam had his sleepover with his two friends. They stayed up until midnight playing video games and ate an entire pizza by themselves. It was exactly what he wanted. When I dropped him off at school on Monday, Lorna Wouldn't even look at me during pickup. She just waved the kids into the classroom and shut the door. Sam said she didn't mention the birthday thing again in class. His two friends came over, they had a great time, and that was that. No drama with the other kids? Because turns out nine year olds don't actually care if they're not invited to every single party.

Isabella's eyes were red from eye drops she'd applied five minutes earlier. She pulled printed copies from her purse, hands shaking perfectly. He's been cheating on me for months, she said, voice cracking. As practice with multiple women, Preston helped me find the truth. My mom's fork clattered. Dad grabbed her hand. Grandma gasped. We have phone records, photos, even a witness. Preston continued. I know it's your birthday, but we couldn't let this continue. Everyone stared at me. I opened my laptop, set it on the table, turned the screen toward mom. Should we show them the real evidence? I said quietly, the 8:47 messages you two exchanged, the videos of you rehearsing. I pressed play. Their voices filled the room. Preston laughing about how stupid but I was. Isabella saying it's exhausting to play girlfriend. Both discussing how they'd split my inheritance, what house they'd buy. The video showed Facetime rehearsals. More tears. Isabella told Preston she needs to believe you're heartbroken. Preston lunged for my laptop. Dad blocked him. Four minutes of evidence played, complete silence. Mom pulled out her phone. With shaking hands and called her lawyer right there. Lawrence, it's Susan. Emergency will revision tonight. I don't care what it costs. Preston tried apologizing. Isabella tried explaining. Mom held up one hand. Out of my house. Both of you, 60 seconds. That was six days ago. The wheels been changed. Preston moved to Denver with nothing. Isabella's back in Ohio with her parents. Me? I'm having pot roast with mom this Sunday.

So I quietly moved to London instead. I'm Elena, 28, and I've been everyone's personal assistant since I graduated college. My phone never stops. Mom needs her dry cleaning picked up. Amanda needs me to babysit every weekend. Josh needs another $200 loan he'll never pay back. I work 60 hour weeks at a marketing firm in New York, just landed a massive promotion. My boss, Stacy, finally offered me that London transfer I've been dreaming about, but I cutting it off because family needs me. Last Tuesday, I'm packing for a rare vacation when mom calls, voice shaking. Elena, emergency, you need to come home right now. I can't explain on the phone. Just get here. My heart stops. I'm thinking someone died, someone's in the hospital. I book a 600 dollar their same day flight from JFK. Cancel my vacation, tell my boss there's a family crisis. The whole flight I'm terrified, imagining the worst. I rush through their front door in Connecticut, scanning for ambulances, police cars, something. The house is silent except for SpongeBob playing on the TV. My niece Lily, age 6, is eating goldfish crackers on the couch. My nephew Max, age 4, doesn't even look up on his iPad. Where's your mom, I asked, trying to stay calm. Lily shrugs. They all let us morning said you were coming to watch us. My stomach drops. I walk to the Kitchen and there it is, a note stuck to the fridge with a smiley face magnet. Dear Elena, we've gone on a two week Caribbean cruise. Watch the kids. There's food in the freezer. Love you, mom, Dad, Amanda and Josh. I stand there, note crumpling in my desk trying process what just happened. They faked an emergency. They lied to get me here. They knew I'd drop everything. I open Facebook and my blood boils. Amanda posted, 3 months ago, finally booked our child free Caribbean vacation, 14 days of paradise. Can't wait to leave the mom life behind. Blessed Archard. No kids. Josh's Instagram story from that morning shows him at the airport, champagne glass raised, two weeks of unlimited drinks and zero responsibilities. Thanks for the free babysitting, sis. Even my parents posted yesterday, anniversary cruise with the kids, 2nd honeymoon vibes. The comments are full of friends saying you deserve this and have fun. They planned this for months, coordinated it and used a fake emergency to manipulate me. I call my boss, Stacy. She answers immediately. Elena, everything okay with your family? Actually, yeah. Remember that London position you offered me last month? The one I turned down because I thought I couldn't leave my family? I'm taking it. When can I start? There's a pause. Are you serious? That's amazing. HR can have you set up in three days if you're ready. I'm ready. I hang up and start planning. First I search emergency Child care Connecticut and find a highly rated service. I call them. I need 24 7 care for two children ages 4 and 6 for the next two weeks starting tomorrow morning.

Pride wouldn't let her. Robert and I got serious. He talked about rings, futures. His father warmed to me once he realized I could hold my own in business conversations. But Patricia got colder, like my success was an insult. Then Robert got laid off. His company downsized and suddenly my successful boyfriend was unemployed. Sending out hundreds of applications. I covered rent, bought groceries, told him it was okay. His family didn't know. Robert was too ashamed. But Patricia figured it out when he kept making excuses to skip dinners. That's when my phone rang at eleven PM on a Tuesday. Mia, it's Patricia. Her voice was different, smaller. Can we talk? I almost declined, but curiosity won. I saw the LinkedIn post, she said quietly, about your promotion to VP. And I heard about Robert. Silence. I was wrong about you. The word sounded painful. You've been supporting him this whole time, not just financially, emotionally. I didn't respond. Let her sit in it. I need to ask something, she continued, voice cracking. Please don't leave him. I know I have no right, but he needs you. Our family needs you. I judged you by things that don't matter and nearly cost my son the best thing that happened to him. I looked at Robert to sleep on the couch, job application still open. Patricia, I said calmly, I never planned On leaving, unlike you, I don't measure people by bank accounts or degrees. I measure them by their heart. Your son has the biggest one. I know. He supported my dreams when no one else did. She was crying now, full sobs. I'm so sorry. Can you forgive me? I already have, I said. But you're not apologizing to me. You're apologizing to yourself for almost losing me as your daughter in law. Robert found a better job three weeks later with better pay. At the Celebration dinner Patricia hosted, she pulled me aside. I owe you more than an apology, she said. I owe you gratitude. You stayed when I pushed you away. You supported him through everything when his mother didn't know he was struggling. Six months after that phone call, Patricia handed me a small box at Christmas. Inside was her grandmother's ring, a gold band with tiny diamonds for when Robert asks, she whispered, welcome to the family, the real one. I smiled the same smile from that day in the apartment. I'd always known my worth. I'd just been waiting for her to see it, too.

Did you see her grades? My grades, the ones that suffered because I couldn't afford textbooks, because I was working nights, because I was too hungry to concentrate.

The last thing I said before leaving, thank you for keeping such detailed receipts. My grandfather would be proud that you documented your crime so thoroughly. I'm not just taking my money back. I'm taking everything they built with it. Sometimes the best revenge isn't walking away. It's taking back every single thing they stole and watching them realize their favorite children will have to save them. Now. Spoiler, Rachel and Tyler have already said they can't help. Turns out loyalty bought with stolen money doesn't last when the money runs out.

So I tested it out on her birthday. Every holiday, every birthday, every Mother's Day, I put actual thought into my gifts. I made her a scrapbook that took three months to collect photos and write memories. Knitted her a blanket with her favorite colors that I spent weeks perfecting. Painted a portrait of her childhood home from an old photo she loved. Meanwhile, my brother Jason buys whatever expensive crap the salesperson suggests, and my sister Emma just transfers money with a generic card. But guess what's displayed in the living room? Jason's five hundred dollar vase that doesn't match anything. Emma's designer purse mom never uses because it's too heavy. The expensive jewelry she doesn't wear because it's not her style. My stuff shoved in the hallway closet with winter coats and old umbrellas. Found the scrapbook under a pile of tax documents. Blanket was in the garage, still in the gift bag I gave it in. The painting was literally facing the wall in the guest room behind a broken lamp. When I asked her about it, she'd say she was keeping them safe or saving them for special occasions or didn't want them to get damaged. But Jason's ugly abstract art he bought drunk at an auction is hanging in the entryway where everyone sees it. Emma's overpriced candles that smell like chemicals are on every surface. Their gifts were apparently damage proof. My Handmade stuff needed Protection by being hidden away. Last Christmas, I watched her open my gift, which was a cookbook I made with all her mother's recipes that I spent months collecting from relatives. She goes, oh, how nice, and immediately puts it aside. Opens Jason's gift, which is an expensive kitchen gadget she'll never use, and goes, oh, my goodness, this is incredible, Jason, you're so thoughtful. Takes 50 photos, post about her amazing son, gets teary eyed about how blessed she is. My cookbook went straight to the basement. That night, I checked.

He was a tech investor who sold his company in the 90s. In his will, he left each grandchild an equal share, including me. My parents became the trustees. They were supposed to use it only for my education, medical needs and basic care until I turned 18. Instead, they used it to fund my sister Rachel's Ivy League education. My brother Tyler's startup that failed within six months. Family vacations to Europe that I was always too young to join, even at 14. The pool they installed. The summer they sent me to my aunt's trailer in Ohio. Because kids need to experience different lifestyles. I discovered this by accident. Three days ago, I was looking for my birth certificate to get my driver's permit. When I found a folder labeled with my name and dad's office. Inside were quarterly statements from Vanguard. My trust fund, which should have been $1.2 million. Had forty seven thousand dollars left. But here's what destroyed me more than the money. There were receipts. Hundreds of receipts they had to keep for the trust. Rachel's college tuition paid for my account. While they told me we couldn't afford SAT Prep. Tyler's business loan, while I worked 30 hours a week at McDonald's to buy my own school supplies. A receipt for a fifteen thousand dollar family cruise dated during the week. They said they were at a marriage retreat and left me with the neighbors. The cruelest receipt. 8 thousand five hundred dollars for my sister Sweet 16 party. The one where they told me I couldn't attend because I wouldn't know anyone there anyway. They literally used my money to throw a party I was banned from. I sat on the floor of that office for two hours doing the math. They'd stolen approximately $1.153 million from me over 17 years. That's $186 per day, every single day of my life.

He picked up the Bill and ripped it in half, then in quarters and threw the pieces at my face. There's your dinner. Enjoy eating paper. He walked to the refrigerator and pulled out the steak he'd brought home for himself last night. Watch this, he said, taking a huge bite in front of me. This is what people who actually contribute to society get to eat while parasites like you get nothing. I stood up and brushed the torn money off my shirt. You wanna know something funny, I asked, reaching into my pocket. What's funny is that you think I'd waste my time listening to you, he said, with his mouth full of steak. No, what's funny is that this morning I won the lottery, I said, pulling out the ticket and holding it up. His face went white before turning red. That's my money, too, because we're married, he screamed and lunging for the ticket. I stepped back toward the door.

He dropped to his knees, the same way he forced me to kneel moments before. Baby, please, we can work this out, he begged. Actual tears forming in his eyes. I didn't mean any of those things.

Clearly waiting for my desperate reaction, I just smiled calmly and said, actually, I've already signed the divorce papers this morning. Say hi to John for me. She completely froze when she realized we've been married seven years. Three weeks earlier, I was making breakfast when her phone lit up on the counter. She was in the shower. The message preview showed a name I didn't recognize. John. And the text said, can't wait for Portland. Two weeks of just us. Portland? She told me she was going to Seattle to stay with her college friend Rachel for two weeks. Something about needing space to clear her head. I didn't pick up her phone or read more. I just stood there staring at those words until the screen went dark. That's when I called Jack, a private investigator my buddy's brother had used during his divorce. I want to know everything, I told Jack at our coffee shop meeting two days later. And I want proof. Photos, messages, whatever you can get. Jack's rate was 100 dollars per hour plus expenses. I wrote him a two thousand dollar retainer check without hesitation. For two weeks, my phone became a documentary of my wife's affair. 2. Italian restaurant. His hand on hers. Day 5. Hiking trail. Matching smiles. Day 7 hotel check in. Room 4. 12 at the Riverside. She video called me. That night, from what looked like a hotel bed, the angle carefully showing just her face and generic wall behind her. Hey, she said, smiling, just wanted to check in. Rachel and I went to this amazing bookstore today. Sounds great, I said, looking at the photo Jack had sent an hour earlier. Her and John at Powells Books in Portland. Jack's background check revealed something else. John Mitchell, 36, worked at her company. Married to Susan for 12 years. Two kids, ages 8 and 5. By day 14, Jack had compiled everything into a folder. Photos, videos, text messages, time stamps, locations. A complete chronicle of betrayal. I met with my attorney, Patricia, that same day. I want a clean break, I told her. No drawn out battles. This documented so well, she has no choice but to accept terms. Patricia had the papers ready by Friday morning. I signed them three hours before my wife's flight landed. At 5:30, the front door opened. She walked in, pulling her suitcase, wearing

Perfect. I grab my dad's wallet from the junk drawer where he always leaves it. Inside is his American Express Black card. I read them the number. Next, I book my flight to London, find a temporary flat and start packing my apartment. Long distance with Stacy's help. The babysitters arrived the next morning. Two professional nannies with excellent references and pediatric first aid certification. I sit Lily and Max down. These nice ladies are going take care of you while your parents are gone. They're really fun and they're going to make sure you have a great time. Lily looks worried. Where are you going, Aunt Elena? I'm going somewhere I should have gone a long time ago, sweetie. Somewhere people. Well, don't lie to me. I leave a note on the same fridge. Hired professional childcare since you really needed it. Cost thirty five hundred dollars. Charged to dad's Amex. My new number is for emergencies only. Real ones this time. I've accepted the London transfer. Don't contact me unless someone's actually dying. Elena. When they docked a week later and checked their credit card statement, all hell broke loose. Mom called 47 times in one hour. I answered once. How did you leave your niece and nephew with strangers? I left them with licensed background check professionals. You left them with someone you manipulated with a fake emergency. Which one of us actually put them at risk? You're being selfish. Family helps family. You're right, mom. That's exactly what I Learned from you. Family uses family until there's nothing left. I'm done being used. Dad got on the phone. If you don't come back and apologize, you're not our daughter anymore. I took a breath. You already made that clear when you chose a vacation over basic honesty. The difference is, I'm choosing it, too, now. I hung up and blocked all their numbers except for one emergency contact. My aunt, who's never asked me for anything. That was eight months ago. I'm thriving in London. Just got another promotion and met someone who actually respects my time. Amanda tried reaching out last month through a mutual friend. The kids miss you. I sent back. They can visit London when their parents teach them that lying to people isn't how you get help. Haven't heard from them since. Best decision I ever made.

So I'm on this train from London to Manchester for my sister's wedding tomorrow. I booked my ticket two weeks in advance because UK trains are either delayed or completely rammed and I'm not the type to leave things to chance. Got seat 23, a window with a table. Paid an extra £15 because I desperately needed somewhere quiet to work on my maid of honor speech. The wedding's tomorrow and I still haven't figured out what to say without either ugly crying in front of 150 guests or making everyone uncomfortable with weird childhood stories nobody wants to hear. I wake up at 6:00am to catch the 7:30 train, grab an iced coffee from Pret because I'm useless without caffeine and bored already mentally rehearsing speech lines. The carriage is absolutely packed. People standing in aisles with massive suitcases, families crammed into sections with kids on laps. General chaos everywhere makes me and grateful I booked ahead. I make my way down checking seat numbers. 21, 22, 23. There she is. Mid forty seconds, woman in a navy blazer, blue light glasses, laptop open, papers everywhere, phone on a stand. She's on a work call talking very loudly about quarterly projections and stakeholder expectations. She is in 23A, my seat. I stand there hoping she'll notice me hovering. She doesn't. Completely locked into her conversation, gesturing like a person can See her. I don't want to interrupt, so I wait in the aisle holding my coffee. Five minutes pass. A guy with a giant suitcase glares at me like I'm blocking traffic on purpose. She finally hangs up. I clear my throat. Hey, sorry, but that's actually my seat. I show my ticket, pointing at 23A. She glances at it, then me, then back to her screen. I'm working, she says flatly. There are other seats. I blink. Right? But this one's mine. I booked it. I need to focus, find somewhere else. Every seat is taken. People are literally standing. Also, her laptop bag is on 23 b. She's taken two seats. I can't. The train's full and I paid extra for this specific seat. Dramatic sigh. I have a major deadline. You'll manage. I spot the ticket inspector coming down the carriage checking tickets. Thank god. I flag him down, probably looking desperate. He's maybe early. 60 seconds, train uniform, already exhausted looking. This woman's in my reserved seat and refusing to move. I show him my ticket. He examines it, looks at the electronic display above her, showing it's reserved. Looks at her, ma'am, this seat's reserved. You'll need to move to your assigned seat. She does.

He left me everything but the real inheritance was a truth that changed everything. My dad married Victoria when I was 16. She was 28, he was 52. Everyone whispered gold digger. But dad was happy. For the first time since mom died, I wanted him to be happy, so I kept quiet about the bad feeling in my gut. Victoria had this way of being sweet when dad was around and cold when he wasn't. She'd make comments. Father so generous, too generous. Sometimes her smile never reached her eyes. By the time I turned 18 and left for college, she'd basically taken over his life. New friends, new hobbies, new everything. Dad was a successful commercial real estate developer, not billionaire rich, but comfortable. Over the next eight years, I watched from a distance as Victoria slowly isolated him. Family gatherings became rare. Phone calls got shorter. When I visit, she'd hover, checking her watch, making dad feel guilty for taking too much time away from their plans. Last November, Dad collapsed at dinner. Heart attack. He survived but barely. The doctor said his heart was severely damaged. As I sat in that hospital room watching him sleep, Victoria appeared in the doorway. We need to talk about his care and his finances, not how is he doing or I'm so scared, just business. That's when I started paying attention. Over the next three months, I noticed Things. Victoria handling all his medications personally. Her keeping detailed notes about his daily routine. Her asking pointed questions about life insurance policies when she thought I wasn't listening. Coldness in her eyes when she looked at him. Then dad asked to see me alone. He looked thinner, older, exhausted. I need you to know something, he whispered. I've been keeping records. Victoria doesn't know, but I've been documenting everything. He handed me a flash drive hidden in a book. If something happens to me, you'll need this. Promise me you'll look at it. Two weeks later, dad died in his sleep, sudden cardiac arrest. Victoria was devastated at the funeral, or at least she performed devastate.

The art teacher's email arrived on a Wednesday afternoon with a subject line that made my stomach drop. Concerns about Iris. Please call ASAP. My daughter was 7 years old and had been painting with me every single evening since she was 4, creating sunset after sunset with a skill that amazed everyone who saw her work. I called Missus Kellerman immediately from my office, already defensive before she even answered. Mister Cross, thank you for calling back so quickly. She's said, her voice carefully neutral. I wanted to discuss something I noticed during today's art class, Iris completed a color wheel assignment, and I'm concerned she might be having some vision issues. She paused, and I heard papers rustling. She labeled every single color incorrectly, not just mixing up similar shades, but completely wrong identifications. She called red, gray, orange, brown, yellow, light gray, green, medium gray. Every color on the wheel was mislabeled as some shade of gray. My first reaction was to defend Iris, to say the teacher must have missed understood. But something about the systematic nature of the errors stopped me. I asked Missus Kellerman to email me photos of the assignment, and when they arrived five minutes later, I stared at my computer screen, feeling like the floor was dissolving beneath my chair. The color wheel was technically perfect, each section painted with smooth gradients and Precise boundaries. But every label was wrong and exactly the way the teacher had described. I immediately thought about our painting sessions, the three years of evening rituals where we painted hundreds of sunsets together. And suddenly I was seeing them differently. How many times had I said, mix orange and pink for those clouds? And watched Iris confidently select paints while I praised her color choices. I left work early and drove home in a daze, calling Iris's pediatrician from in the car. Doctor Patel squeezed us in for an appointment the next morning and referred us to a pediatric ophthalmologist named Doctor Vivian Leeds, who specialized in color vision deficiencies. I watched Iris during our painting session with new attention, really looking at what she was doing. We were painting the sunset visible through our dining room window, and I described it out loud, the way I always did. Look at those beautiful orange and pink clouds, I said, pointing at the sky. Try mixing some cadmium orange with a touch of titanium white and maybe a hint of quinacridone magenta. Iris nodded seriously and reached for paints, confidently squeezing colors onto her palette. But when I looked closely at what she'd selected, my chest tightened. The orange she'd chosen was actually a brown. The pink was a gray. She was mixing them together.

Harry found me, saw the apron on the counter, and his face went completely cold. He didn't say a word to me. He just walked straight into the living room, where Olivia was still holding court. Give me your phone, he said. His voice was quiet, but everyone heard it. The room went silent. What? Harry, we're celebrating. Give me your OR phone. She handed it over, laughing nervously. Harry deleted every post, every story, every photo from that night while 60 people watched in complete silence. Then he turned to face the entire party. This woman you all humiliated tonight. She's my wife. The woman I chose to spend my life with. And, Olivia, since you care so much about status and money, let me remind you of something. He pulled out His phone and opened an email. Mom left you the business, but she left me the house. The family house that you've been managing and collecting 12 thousand dollar monthly rent. I'm selling it. Effective immediately. Olivia's face went from confused to white in seconds. You can't. I can't? I just accepted an offer this afternoon. You've got 60 days to figure out how to run your lifestyle without that trust fund income. The room was dead silent. Olivia tried to grab his arm, but he pulled away. He took my hand and we walked out while everyone stared. Turns out their mom's will gave Harry the family property, but allowed Olivia to manage it and collect commercial tenant rent, a supplement to income. That 12 thousand dollar monthly was funding her luxury car payments, designer shopping and that expensive condo. Harry sold the house to a developer in three weeks for 2.3 million dollars. We used part of it to buy our own place. Olivia had to downsize her life completely. She sold the condo, traded her Range Rover for a used sedan and her Instagram went quiet. She hasn't spoken to either of us since. And honestly, I'm okay with that.

Michael Carter. My blood turned to ice. Your sister Jessica is claiming you stole her car, crashed it and abandoned her at the scene. My voice went sharp. My car. The one in my name that she took without asking. Do you have proof of ownership? Of course I did. But that wasn't the problem. The problem was what the officer said next. She also claims you threatened her, refused to help and told her she'd regret it. My hands clenched. That's a complete lie. And you won't mind coming to the station. At the station, they showed me Jessica's statement. Pure fiction. She claimed I've been drinking, that I crashed, that I abandoned her. And at the bottom, witnesses David and Linda Carter. Parents confirming Jessica's story. My own parents had signed a statement against me. I leaned back, voice deadly calm. Officer, I'd like to file my own report. He raised an eyebrow. Jessica Carter stole my vehicle. I never gave permission. I want to press charges for Grand Theft Auto. The tables turned instantly. Within three hours, Jessica's employer called. We're conducting an internal review. Your sister listed you as a character witness. Told them everything. They thanked me and hung up. Jessica called 14 times that day. I ignored everyone. Then the voicemail. They fired me. Do you hear me? They fired me. I hope you're happy. I didn't bother listening to the rest. My parents showed up that night. You need to fix this. She lost everything because of you. I shook my head. Because of me or because she lied to the police? Mom's eyes narrowed. She's your sister. If you don't take her in, she'll be homeless. I looked them both in the eyes. No! Mom gasped like I'd slapped her. You took her side. You called me selfish. You backed her lies. And now you want me to open my home to her? We're family, Michael. Family forgives. I exhaled slowly. Not this time. And I shut the door. Three days later, Jessica showed up. Hair a mess, clothes wrinkled, eyes desperate. Michael, I have nowhere to go. I stared at her, years of resentment boiling beneath my skin. You tried to get me arrested, Jess. I know, she whispered. I just. I need my brother back. For a split second, she looked like my little sister again. But I knew this was the moment I had to choose. You need me when it's convenient. You took my car, lied to the police, and now you expect me to forgive you? Her lips trembled. Michael, please. Goodbye, Jess. And for the last time, I shut the door. Two months later, I moved. New city, new job, new life. No calls, no messages. And for the first time, I was living for me.

My things were in trash bags in the hallway. My stepmother stood there smiling, arms crossed, and told me that since I was legally an adult in less than a year, I should learn how the real world works. My dad was away on a two week work trip and had no idea. She turned my room into a baby play zone for her new home daycare. I slept in my car for four nights until my best friend's mom found out and took me in. When my dad came back, she cried and spun some story about boundaries and discipline and how I cursed at her. I hadn't. He didn't make me move back in, but he also didn't do anything else. I graduated, worked two jobs, and cut them both off. I built my own life. Ten years later, I'm 27 and I own a boutique interior renovation firm. We mostly do high end commercial interiors. Think reception lobbies, small hotels, spa redesigns. Nothing huge, but the margins are good and I know what I'm doing. I hadn't spoken to my stepmother, Bethany since I walked out that night. My dad and I talk once or twice a year. Birthdays and the occasional forced holiday call. A month ago, I got a new client. A small commercial daycare looking to renovate their space. I was doing the final walkthrough with the owner when I spotted Bethany out of the corner of my eye. She didn't recognize me. At first, she looked rougher. Heavier makeup, tighter skin, probably some budget Botox. But when her eyes landed on me, she froze. She worked there? Not just worked. She owned it. The daycare I've been contracted to renovate was hers. Apparently, she'd started it after divorcing her ex husband, who used to be a lawyer. They funny how small towns stay small. That night, I did some digging. Her daycare license was squeaky clean. The lease on her commercial space was up for renewal in five months. That gave me time. Now, here's the thing. Bethany's ex husband, Darren, used to do business litigation. A decade ago, he left her and quit law altogether. Rumor was she drove him to a nervous breakdown. But I didn't know him well enough to care until I found out he lived less than 20 minutes from my office. I reached out. He didn't even ask why I wanted to meet. When I explained everything.

I'm 32, work in IT, six figures, own a house, married to Melody. Dad's retired and happy. We talk multiple times a week. Then Anna calls out of nowhere. Mom and Angelo need to go into assisted living. $4,000 a month. Their pension covers half. We're thinking the four of us kids could each chip in $500. Four kids? I said I'm not Angelo's kid. Come on, Parker. He's getting old. Mom stressed out of her mind trying to coordinate all this. Angelo made it clear when I was 16 that I wasn't family. I was a tenant. So I left. That was 16 years ago. You're still holding on to that? Yep. And by his own logic, he should have saved. Better responsibility and all that. Bryce called next. Same guilt trip, different person. Then mom crying, begging. Then Angelo himself. I'm asking you man to man. Angelo said, we're not men. To each other, we're nothing. I'm sorry, alright? Is that what you wanna hear? And there it was. The apology. I've been waiting For since I was 16. Only it came 16 years too late. Only because he needed something from me. Your apology means nothing because it's not real. You're not sorry you did it. You're sorry it's biting you now. If you. You were actually sorry, you would have reached out years ago when you didn't need anything. Your mother is going to suffer because of your pride. My mother is going to suffer because of choices she made 16 years ago. The calls kept coming. Anna tried visiting my house. Bryce called melody directly to convince her to convince me I could afford the $500. Wouldn't even register in our budget. Melody and I are comfortable. But every time I started to feel guilty. I remembered being 16. Working until closing, stressed about money while his kids lived in comfort. I remembered my mom sitting silent at that dinner table, choosing him over me. They had 16 years to make this right. 16 years to apologize, to rebuild. They didn't. Not once. Last I heard, they sold the house, moved somewhere cheaper. Anna and Bryce stopped paying after realizing I wasn't budging. And me living my best life with people who actually treat me like family. Angelo wanted to teach me responsibility. He did. I just Learned who actually deserves it.

She played a prank calling me the housemaid at her party and posted it online to embarrass me. But what my husband did next shut her up. My husband Harry and I have been married two years. We met in college, started dating after graduation, and honestly, I've never been happier. Except for one thing. His sister, Olivia. Olivia runs a successful marketing agency and lives in a world where your worth is measured by your bank account. My parents worked hard their entire lives. Dad was a janitor, mom did housekeeping and ran errands for wealthier families. They raised me and my three sisters with dignity and love. I'm genuine. Be proud of where I come from. But Olivia. She made a face the first time I mentioned my parents jobs at a family dinner. Ever since, she's made it clear I'm not good enough for her family. She'd serve me dinner on noticeably cheaper dates than everyone else. She. She bought me an 85 dollar knockoff Hoda bag for my birthday while gifting her assistant an all expenses paid trip to Bali. The same year, Harry got a Rolex. I never told Harry how bad it was. I didn't want to create drama between siblings. Looking back, that was my biggest mistake. Last month, Olivia invited us to her housewarming party at her new downtown condo. The place probably cost $800,000. Two days before the event, she called me Directly. Hey, could you come early to help set up? Just us girls? She said sweetly. I want to get to know you better. I was shocked. Maybe she was finally trying to bond with me. Harry had a working and couldn't come until later, so I showed up at four PM, two hours before guests arrive. The moment I walked in, Olivia handed me a black apron. The caterer canceled last minute. You don't mind helping serve, right? You said your mom did this kind of work. My stomach dropped, but her friends were already arriving. I felt trapped. For the next two hours, I served champagne and appetizers to the 50 people while Olivia laid hostess in a designer dress. Her friends kept asking me for refills like I was invisible. No one knew I was the sister in law. Then came the toast. Olivia clinked her glass and gathered everyone in the living room. I was in the kitchen when she called out, can our wonderful housemate join us? I walked out, still wearing the apron. She had this huge smile. I want to thank my amazing staff for tonight, she announced, gesturing at me. Isn't she just wonderful? So dedicated. Her friends laughed and raised their glasses. Then came the phones. Everyone was recording. She threw her arm around me. You know, good.

So I moved in with my dad. Years later, my stepdad wants me to help with his retirement home bills because they wouldn't. I was working weekends at a grocery store trying to save for college. Angelo, my stepdad, called a family meeting. His kids, Anna and Bryce, sat there smirking. They got $50 and $40 weekly allowances just for existing. I worked 15 hours a week making minimum wage. Time I'm to start paying rent. Angelo announced $300 a month. I actually laughed, thought it was a joke, but he was dead serious. Real world son, time to learn responsibility. My mom just sat there silent. That's when I knew she'd already agreed to it. Does Anna pay rent? I asked. Different situation. She doesn't have a job. She gets free money every week. That's an allowance, not income. The logic was insane. His kids got paid to exist. I had to pay to exist. I did the math that night, 300 dollars out of my 450 dollar monthly paycheck. I'd have nothing left for gas, my phone Bill, food, college savings, nothing. I'd be working just to live in a house where two other kids got paid to breathe. Meanwhile, Anna was planning her Sweet 16 party with money she didn't earn. So I called my dad. He lived 45 minutes away. We split when I was 10 but stayed Close. When I told him about the rent, he went quiet. $300 from a 16 year old? Is he insane? Then pack your stuff, kid. You're coming home. Took me two weeks to move everything out quietly. Didn't make a scene. Just the note on my bed. Moved in with dad. Thanks for the life lesson, Angelo. Mom called the next morning absolutely freaking out. Angelo got on the phone too. Running away proves my point about responsibility. I'm proving I don't have to put up with garbage. Make Anna pay rent. If it's such a great lesson, I hung up. Life at Dad's was completely different. No rent, just real responsibilities. Cooking 3 nights a week, actual chores we did together. Conversations about budgeting.

Then I saw the message from my mom, dated two weeks before the trip. Don't mention the vacation around Claire. She'll make it about Mia again. At night, I made my decision. I found a new apartment, transferred my savings and stopped paying their bills, all of them. When they came home, tanned and relaxed, I was sitting at the kitchen table. Where are the groceries? Dad opened the empty fridge. I smiled. Oh, I don't live here anymore. The color drained from Mom's face. What? What? This is your house now. The mortgage is due next week, by the way, and the utility bills should arrive any day. Claire, you can't, can't, what? Stop paying for everything while you treat my daughter like she's disposable, Mom's voice cracked. We're family. Family helps each other. I grabbed my keys. You wanted your perfect life without Mia in it. Congratulations. Now enjoy paying for it yourselves. Three days later, the panic call started. 6 voice mails, 15 texts. The mortgages do. Did you forget to transfer? Why is the electricity Bill so high? Claire, answer me. I didn't. By week two, they showed up at my door. Mom, fake tears, ready. Dad, too proud to beg, but desperate enough to try. We need financial support. Just temporarily. Temporary. Barely. Like how you temporarily decided Mia wasn't real family. Dad's jaw clenched. We supported you by watching the kids. I laughed. You mean the kids you played favorites with? The ones you divided into real and not real? Mom snapped. You're being cruel. No, mom, cruel is making a 6 year old feel unwanted. Cruel is taking her brothers on vacation while she watches them drive away. Cruel is what you did. Silence. If you want to keep your house, I said, you'll figure it out. And I closed the door. One year later, my parents sold their house, moved into a smaller place, finally Learned to live within their means. Mia, she's thriving, smiling, finally safe. Last week she whispered, I like our new home, Mommy. Me too, baby. Because I finally Learned something too. Family isn't about blood. It's about love. And love, that's something my parents never really understood.

His friends already knew stories about me. Sebastian had apparently been talking about his badass climbing partner for months. Kenzie stood there. Designer dress and perfect makeup useless against authentic connection. How long have you been doing this together? Someone asked. Six months, Sebastian said, then looked at me with this soft expression. Best six months of my week. Every week, Kenzie tried to interject, mentioning the marketing campaign they'd worked on together. Sebastian barely heard her. He was already pulling up videos on his phone showing everyone this route we'd Worked on together, his hand naturally finding my shoulder as he narrated our victory. You never told me you climbed, Kenzie said, her voice sharp. You never asked what I did Wednesday and Friday nights, I replied. You just said to stay out of your way. Sebastian looked between us, understanding dawning on his face. Wait. You're the friend who's always busy when Kenzie invites you out. He turned to Kenzie. You said she was antisocial. Later that evening, after Kenzie had left early claiming a headache, I found Sebastian on the rooftop edge. So red has a real name, he said, pulling me down beside him. And apparently a complicated best friend. Not anymore, I said quietly. He studied my face. You know, I've been trying to work up the courage to ask you out for months, but you always vanished after climbing. I didn't think you'd ever see me that way, I admitted. Are you serious? His voice was thought. You're the only person I look for when I walk into that gym. The next morning Kenzie texted me saying I didn't know you were the girl from the gym.

I should have fought back. Instead, I watched my son's Aiden and Lucas jump into the Uber, their faces bright with excitement. While six year old Mia stood beside me. Mommy, why? Why didn't they take me? I pulled her close. They'll regret this baby. For 4 years I paid their mortgage, their utilities, their groceries, everything. They watched my kids while I worked.

I took Mia to the water park, bought her new clothes, ice cream, posted every moment to the family chat. Mom's response, don't go overboard. Then I found something. Scrolling through their vacation photos, I noticed the resort name. I looked it up. 8 thousand Dollars per night, three nights for a family of four. I went numb. They couldn't afford their own mortgage, but they could afford a 24 thousand dollar vacation. I checked my bank statements. I've been using my credit card, the one I gave them for emergencies this entire trip. The overwater bungalows, the jet skis, the gourmet meals. I had paid for all of it. They used my money to exclude my daughter. But it got worse. I found the group chat, the one without me. My sister was in it.

My stepsister Kelly is the definition of entitled. After dad married her mom three years ago, she tried banning mentions of my late mother in our house. She'd scream if I so much as said mom's name. The whole family saw through her immediately except Dad. Kelly's obsessed with and some jewelry. On her first birthday with us, dad bought her a beautiful diamond ring, cost him $3,000. She took one look at it and locked herself in her room crying all day. Later heard her on the phone. I'm telling a friend it didn't even hit my figures. But the real issue was her relationship with grandma. They openly despised each other. At Christmas Two years ago, Kelly got drunk and called grandma a bitch in front of everyone because she gave her a 50 dollar gift card instead of jewelry. I tried telling dad that Kelly was using him for money. He called me jealous and disrespectful, said I needed to give my new sister a chance. Then everything changed. Six months ago, grandma got diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. Doctor said maybe half a year to live. The whole family was devastated except Kelly saw an opportunity. Literally overnight, she transformed into the world's most devoted granddaughter. Started calling grandma every morning at 8:00am sharp. She'd show up with medicine, chocolate, fancy organic Smoothies even offered to move in as her full time caretaker for free. At first I thought maybe she changed. Then I visited grandma one afternoon and found her laughing while looking at credit card statements. Your stepsister thinks I'm senile, grandma said, showing me the charges. Every visit, Kelly had been taking Grandma's wallet and charging hundreds of dollars. Designer handbags, jewelry, free spa treatments, always right after her caring granddaughter visits. Why don't you stop her, I asked. Grandma smiled. Because I'm keeping receipts. Let her dig her own grave. The months passed, Kelly kept up her act flawlessly. She'd cry at family dinners about how unfair it was that grandma was sick. Dad ate it up completely. See, Kelly really has grown. You should be more like her. I already visited grandma twice a week, had been for 20 years. But sure, Dad. Grandma passed away two weeks ago. Kelly wore all black at the funeral and cried dramatically through the whole service. It was Oscar worthy. Then came the will reading. Yesterday, the whole family gathered at the lawyer's office. Kelly sat front row next to dad. I could see dollar signs in her eyes. The lawyer started reading the Lakehouse worth 8 hundred k investment accounts totaling.

Lily grabbed my hand as we walked up the stone path. It really is like a castle. At the entrance, a woman in a black dress held an iPad. Name, please, Nora Brennan, she scrolled, frowned, scrolled again. I'm sorry, I don't see that name on the list. My stomach dropped. There must be a mistake. I'm the bride's sister. The woman's expression shifted to uncomfortable sympathy. Let me get the coordinator. Five minutes later, mom appeared in the lobby, was wearing champagne silk, her hair professionally styled. She looked like she belonged in a magazine. Our eyes met, hers went cold. What are you doing here? Lily was watching, confusion spreading across her face. I have an invitation. I just wanted, did you really think you were invited? Her voice was sharp enough to cut glass. Several guests in the lobby turned to stare. Strangers aren't allowed at family events. Nora. Lily tugged my hand. Mommy, who is that lady? Mom's eyes flicked down to Lily. For the first time I saw something cross her face. Shock maybe or disgust. We're leaving, I said quietly. I knelt down and smoothed Lily's hair. Come on, sweetie, this party isn't for us. As we turn to go, Lily looked back at mom and said in her clear six year old voice, that lady was mean. I thought grandmas were supposed to be nice. The lobby went silent. Mom's face drained of colour. A Woman in a navy dress gasped. I picked Lily up and walked out without another word. We were 20 minutes down the highway when my phone started vibrating. Text after text, all from Mom. Becca's future mother in law heard everything. She's asking questions. People think I abandoned a grandchild. You need to fix this now. I turned my phone off and took Lily to the aquarium instead. Three days later, Becca blocked me on everything. Mom's trying to tell everyone. Lily isn't real.

Right now, there's a bomb. Calmly, I was riding the subway when I suddenly noticed a person dressed really strangely. So I carefully observed him. Again, he quietly placed a black backpack under the seat. But just as the train was about to depart, that guy rushed out in a hurry. As an FBI agent, I felt something was off about this. So I quickly found that black backpack. But when I opened it, I discovered there was a fucking timed bomb inside. At this point, the train had already entered the tunnel. If an explosion happened, all the passengers would lose their lives. Then I saw the emergency door button, so I didn't hesitate to activate the emergency break switch. The train stopped in the tunnel after the emergency break. At this moment, I warned everyone to get off immediately. Hey, FBI, I need everybody to exit the train into the tunnels quietly and call me right now. There's a bomb. Call me. When they Learned there was a bomb in the car, all the passengers immediately became panicked. Everyone was running for their lives. At this moment, I suddenly saw a mother and daughter standing there not knowing what to do. So I rushed over. I picked up the little girl and quickly ran outside. Just as we jumped off the train, that fucking time bomb suddenly exploded. Under my Protection, the little Girl wasn't hurt. At this moment, I suddenly saw a string of numbers not far away. This number became the key to solving the case. Later, the police quickly arrived at the crime scene. She said I might have a concussion. Fortunately, I discovered the bomb in time and evacuated the crowd. This terrorist attack didn't cause too many casualties. I saw the mother and daughter I had rescued. What just happened left me shaken. Suddenly, I actually spotted that motherfucker who placed the bomb in the crowd. Hey, that's, that's him. Hey, that's the guy. I rushed after him, but I couldn't run fast because I was injured. That guy quickly ran into a remote alley. I chased after him, but he disappeared quickly. I figured he must be hiding somewhere. So I nervously searched every corner around me. At this moment, I suddenly noticed a large dumpster ahead. But when I just opened the lid, that motherfucker suddenly attacked me from behind. He tried to grab my gun. I immediately fought back. At this moment, I suddenly saw a snake shaped tattoo on his body. I kicked him away with force. And at this point, he just wanted to escape as quickly as possible. But I didn't give up on catching him. Just as I was about to catch him, a car suddenly hit me hard and knocked me to the ground. At this moment, I couldn't stand up. No matter how hard I tried. I could only Watch that motherfucker disappear from my sight. One year later, because I performed excellently in this terrorist attack incident, I was assigned to the White House for a very secretive job. The working hours were very unusual. I got up at five PM every day and arrived at the White House before 7:30. When I arrived at my workplace, I needed to show my ID, surrender my gun, and I also needed to pass facial recognition before I could enter inside smoothly. Every night at 8:00, I could swipe my card to enter my office and switch shifts with another colleague. My job duties were also very unusual. I just needed to stare at this landline phone on the desk all night, always paying attention to whether anyone called this phone. Since I started working here, I had never heard it ring. But if it suddenly rang, this would mean national security was seriously threatened. I repeated the same work every day. But on that night, the landline suddenly rang. Uh, yes, go ahead. Um, night action. They told me to tell you that code, please pen clock, door fire. My Aunt Emma, Emma Campbell, her and my Uncle Henry are in danger. They told me to call you. They're in danger. There's intruders and I, and I think they're after me too. How many intruders are there? I think two. I, I saw him. I saw one of them. I saw his face. Okay. Where are they? I need an address. Uh, 54 Walwin Lane in Strong Ridge. I could sense she was very scared at that moment. So I immediately called the FBI to go rescue her. But while she was on the phone with me, the killer had already arrived outside the house. She was scared out of her mind. I told her to hide upstairs immediately. At this moment, the killer seemed to have discovered her. Now what? Is there a bathroom? Yes. Okay. Does a door lock from the inside? Uh, yes. Listen carefully. Lock the door, close it, but do not go inside the room. You understand? Okay. Now what? Okay. Very quietly go to the furthest bedroom, find a closet and get inside it. She quickly took down a mirror from the wall. she placed the mirror on the ground to observe the killer's position. At this time, the killer had already entered the house. He found the phone wasn't on the table, so he figured she must be upstairs. At this moment. She hid in the closet. In a panic, the killer walked up the stairs. Step by step, she saw the killer's figure through the mirror. The killer first went to the bathroom. He found the door was locked from inside. He forced the door open but didn't find her. He's coming. The police are on their way. Alright? It's too late.

She's not home. That's not like her. No, I just mean she can't come to the door. She's taking a bath. Are those for her? Yeah. I had so many, I didn't know what to do with them. Look, Henry, I don't know if you've heard, but there's because I could no longer bear children. My husband cheated on me. He started a new family with another woman and my son. Henry and I relied solely on each other. Until this man appeared and shattered our years of quiet life. Henry and I encountered Frank at the supermarket. He threatened us, demanding we take him home. He just escaped, was injured and needed rest. He promised not to harm us to avoid being accused of harboring a criminal. Frank gently tied me up. His movements felt so tender, and I felt a bit more at ease. He made us lunch. He cooked with such skill. He even brought the food to me, gently blowing on it to cool it before feeding me. In that moment, I realized for the first time that a man could be so gentle. The next day, he made us breakfast again. For the first time in years, I tasted breakfast made by a man. After breakfast, he repaired our broken steps, change my car's oil, chopped wood for me, wax my floors, and taught Henry how to play baseball. Watching these scenes unfold, my heart fluttered. How wonderful it would be If you were my husband. In my free time, I mended his trousers. Suddenly, a knock sounded at the door, startling us both. I pretended Frank was kidnapping me, so Henry would answer the door to see who it was. Thankfully, it was just a neighbor dropping off peaches. Frank looked at the basket of ripe peaches and said he'd teach us how to make peach pie. That lovely afternoon, we felt like a family. Frank held my hand. My body, untouched for years, felt like it was electrified. In the days that followed, Frank took over all the household chores. He even kindly taught Henry how to change a tire. Frank and I grew closer. But one day, the neighbor's wife left her disabled son in my care. I couldn't refuse. Fortunately, he couldn't speak properly, so he posed no danger to Frank. We played baseball together. Once more, I felt Frank's tenderness. That evening, the neighbor came to pick up her son. But disaster struck. Her child saw Frank on the news as a wanted criminal. He suddenly began screaming. I fear Frank's identity would be exposed. But it turned out to be a false alarm. He couldn't articulate what he wanted to say. Watching them leave, I knew this couldn't go on. Frank and I decided to leave this place together. We'd start a new somewhere else. We packed our things. Henry and I went into town to withdraw money. Withdrawing too much at once made the Teller suspicious. Actually, we've packed up all the things. We're emptying our bank account, then gonna make a run for the border. You know, like Bonnie and Clyde. Henry's words dispelled the teller's doubts. A tactic Frank had taught him. Just as we were about to leave after returning home, police sirens blared. I froze, paralyzed with fear. To protect us from being implicated, Frank bound us once more. He went out alone to turn himself in.

My mother died giving birth to me. My father saw me as a monster and walked away. When my foster mother first saw me, she almost cried in fear. The doctors said I had early aging. I had every illness an old man could have. They said I wouldn't live for more than two weeks. But a nurse who couldn't have children believed I was a miracle from god. He took me home and gave me the name Benjamin. I grew up in a nursing home, surrounded by people waiting for their final days. Seven years passed. I looked like a tiny old man. My hair was thin. I needed a wheelchair to move. But deep down, I was still a child. I wanted to see the world outside. Yet I could only watch others run from the window. Then one day, a priest told me to believe in miracles. I forced myself to stand for the first time. I left the wheelchair behind. Days went by. My body got stronger. The wrinkles faded. I started to look younger. When I turned 12, I met Daisy. She made my heart race for the first time. She came every weekend to visit her grandma. We ate together, listen to stories. And she showed me her secret place. She said I was different. She touched my wrinkled face at the midnight. You are not to be playing together. Yes, ma'am. And you are gonna be Ashamed of yourself? That day, I truly felt like a monster. Years passed. Daisy grew into a beautiful woman. We watched the ocean together. She said she wanted to sail away someday. Her words planted a dream inside me. In the nursing home, people kept leaving, one by one. I started to understand what loss meant. When Missus Lawson passed away, I felt pain for the first time in my life. At 17, I packed my things and said goodbye. Daisy's eyes were full of tears. We promised to stay in touch no matter where I went. I became a sailor, sailing across the ocean. Everywhere I went, I sent Daisy a postcard. She became a dancer. I became a drifter. We lived in our own worlds. Until one day, I wrote to her that I had fallen in love. Her name was Elizabeth. She was gentle and graceful. She wasn't stunning, but she drew me in completely. We had dinners together, walked through the snow. She made me forget about time. Then one morning, she was gone. Only a note was left behind. When I was 21, the war began. Our ship was taken by the Navy. I was sent to the battlefield. Bullets flew past me. Our captain was shot. Everyone on board was lost. Only I survived. When the war ended, I went home. I looked younger again. My foster mother almost didn't recognize me. Soon after, Daisy came back. She was breathtaking. We had dinner together, She talked about her dance career, but I couldn't hear a single word. She felt so far away. That night, I hesitated again. And we missed each other once more. Later, I went to New York to surprise her. On stage, Daisy was glowing. I couldn't take my eyes off her. After the show, I saw her boyfriend. Young, charming. And I looked like an old man beside him. I smiled, wish them well. Then one day, a letter arrived. I flew to Paris. There she was, lying in a hospital bed. The accident took away her stage. I held her hand. My heart broke in silence. Ten years later, I went back to visit my foster mother. And Daisy returned. To that day, I'll never forget. We were finally the same age. Nothing stood between us anymore. We sailed together, watched the sunrise and the sunset. Those days were the happiest of my life. Then Daisy told me she was pregnant. I didn't smile. I was scared. I was afraid our child would live my reversed life from old to young. But fate showed mercy. Our daughter was born healthy. A beautiful little girl. She grew up day by day. And I grew younger. I knew she needed a father, not a playmate. So one day, I left everything behind and walked away. I disappeared from their world. Fifteen years later, Daisy found me again. She was covered in gray hair and I looked 20. It tore me apart inside. Another decade passed. The nursing home called. They found a boy with her name written in his notebook. She rushed there and saw me. I was a teenager again. My face full of acne, my memory completely gone. She moved into the home, taking care of me like a mother caring for her child. We had loved each other all our lives. Now we met again at the end. I grew smaller every day. From a boy to a baby. And in my final breath, I looked at her, remembered everything.

The hospital received two patients on the same day. One was a girl whose face was disfigured in an accident. The other was a girl declared brain dead after a car crash. They were total strangers with no connection. But because of one donation agreement, their lives became intertwined in a way no one expected. The mother of the car crash victim watched helplessly as her daughter was pushed into the operating room. Despite the doctors doing everything they could, a miracle still did not happen for her daughter. The chief doctor gently told the mother that her daughter could now only survive through medical machines, and she had to make a decision no parent should ever face. You ask about organ donation if you want her what? Her heart. The doctor explained that her daughter's organs were too damaged to donate. But the hospital had another girl whose face was disfigured in an accident. I wanna take my daughter's face. And this young girl's life has been devastated. And you have a chance. I'm sorry, Doctor Andrews. No. By coincidence, the mother ran into that disfigured girl in the elevator. She heard the girl talking cheerfully with her doctor, and she could not help but imagine if the accident had never happened, she and her daughter would probably be out enjoying a picnic right now. As the disfigured girl was wheeled out of the elevator, the mother made a heartbreaking decision. In her heart. Later, she went to find the chief doctor. She wanted to speak, but the words would not come out. Finally, she said she was willing to donate her daughter's face to give that disfigured girl a chance to live a new life. You're the same sex, race, approximate age, share compatible blood types and antigens and a whole bunch of other things that make you the perfect match. And we just received permission from her next of kin. The doctor immediately began to organize the surgery to make sure the transplant would fit perfectly. The medical team gave up their rest hours and practiced the entire procedure over and over again. But the girl who was about to receive a new face was filled with fear and confusion inside. I don't know how to accept a gift like this. Someone else's face, someone else's identity. The face is just a mask. It's what's underneath that counts. Those lame clothes we've been mocking, you're gonna use them on me, Molly. Right now, your face is the only thing anyone sees. This operation will change that. It'll let the world see not your new face, but what has always been behind it. Then came the day of the surgery. I keep thinking she's just sleeping. How can I say goodbye? We call it the walk of honor to thank your daughter for her sacrifice. The mother tightly held her daughter's hand, accompanying her through the final moments before saying Goodbye. She gently kissed her daughter's cheek, then let go of her hand with tears streaming down her face, watching as the doctors pushed her daughter into the operating room as rehearsed. Veins, arteries, nerves, in that order, from the chin up. Yes. After days and nights of careful rehearsal, the surgery went smoothly and successfully. In the recovery room, the doctor handed the mirror to the girl, letting her see her new reflection for the first time. At that moment, the mother of the donor girl walked in. She handed the girl her daughter's photo album. And thank you for timing that elevator ride so perfectly. Can I ask you for a favor? I'd like to say goodbye.

This nuclear strike will cause 10 million casualties and it will reach its target in just 19 minutes. National Security Advisor Helen remains completely unaware she has just arrived at the White House security checkpoint. Beyond her bag and personal belongings, even her high heels must be removed for inspection. Her phone is placed in a locker and locked. Helen arrived at the White House Strategic Intelligence Room and exchanged brief pleasantries with colleagues. She assumed it would be business as usual. But soon after, she received reports of an anomalous missile launch. No one paid it much mind, assuming it was merely another nation's exercise, a scenario that had played out countless times before. When the Pacific sea based radar system transmitted a signal, the soldiers monitoring the screens realized this situation felt different. They couldn't locate the launch point. Satellites detected no missile launch. Despite this, Helen followed protocol and convened a video conference with military commanders to discuss the missile threat. As the general briefed the situation, the operation center began simulating the missile's trajectory. The sergeant stared at the projected impact zone on the screen and realized the missile had altered course. This meant it would strike the U S. Mainland. They had only 19 minutes left. Helen instantly grasped the gravity of the situation. She ordered her team to contact the president. Immediately, a missile countdown appeared on the White House's main screen. The sergeant frantically began flipping through manuals. Seeing her Trembling and unable to speak, a colleague beside her urged her to stay calm. Only then did she locate the code and read it aloud after the order was confirmed. Observing the level 2 alert status on the screen, the Strategic Intelligence Room personnel also felt a surge of panic. They had never experienced this state before. Speculation immediately began among the group which nation had launched the nuclear missile. Ultimately, these were mere conjectures, lacking any concrete evidence to support them. The admiral instructed them to remain calm. Any intelligence must be submitted to him immediately. Otherwise they were to cease baseless speculation. Hurry and gather relevant information. Only then did the scattered minds refocus. Helen directed him to monitor the missile launch. Seeing the footage, the admiral realized this was real. The operation center had already activated the missile Silo. Watching the hatch slowly open, everyone was filled with trepidation. The base broadcast also sounded, ordering personnel to take immediate shelter in place. The secretary of defense joined the video conference. Has anyone initiated the government continuity plan? He demanded. Preparations must commence immediately. Evacuate key personnel the moment a crisis arises. By then, they had calculated the missile's projected impact zone. The strategic intelligence room descended into chaos. The missile launch countdown had begun in the operation center.

But just as I stepped inside, I was stopped again. You know the rules. No dogs allowed. Come on, let my dog in the supermarket. You know my dog. Okay, so if you tell her to sit and stay, it'll listen. Yeah, Bruno, sit, stay. Yeah, he'll stay. Good. Then he could sit and stay his ass out there. And in the end, I had no choice but to leave Bruno outside. I tied him by The roadside. And told them over and over to stay still before walking into the store. I hadn't been inside long when a boy noticed Bruno sitting alone, looking around. He quietly walked up and in Bruno's leash. At that very moment, I happened to glance through the window and saw it. Someone was trying to steal my dog. I dashed out of the supermarket and sprinted after them. The boy ran faster and faster, dragging Bruno with him. And I chased with every ounce of strength I had left. Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Huh? You steal my dog? No, this is my dog. It's your dog. What are you talking about? This is my dog! No, this is my dog.

He unzipped his pants and a nasty, unbearable smell hit her nose. She couldn't take it and threw up right away. Unable to face what was happening, she crawled toward the window and jumped without hesitation. They weren't bad women. They were victims of human trafficking. This story is based on real events. One of the women, Lisa, was about to face the same nightmare. Like most girls her age, she loved dressing up and looking beautiful. One day, she received an invitation for a modelling audition. Every girl wants to show her best self in front of the camera, and the staff looked totally professional. Their setup felt just like a real casting. The man in charge was impressed by Lisa's looks and body, so he told her she passed the audition. He said they'd take her to model training tomorrow and a week later she'd join a competition. Lisa didn't tell her dad because she knew he wouldn't let her go. Thinking this was her big chance, she quietly packed her bags and left while he was asleep. She followed the crew to a fancy villa. But as soon as she went upstairs, she saw something off. All the women were sleeping on the floor, their faces filled with sadness and despair. Then one man handed cash to the guy who brought Lisa, and she was taken into a bedroom. The next day, Lisa was brought to a Bar. Every night older men came there and her new job was to drink with them.

Why? To take over his brother's failing restaurant. Then his brother died, leaving him nothing but debt and a broken dream. To keep the doors open, Carmi burned through every dollar he had. He called every friend he'd ever helped, but the moment he left the fancy kitchens, they all turned their backs. Desperate, he dug through old boxes, even pulled out his rare denim collection, hoping to trade it for fresh ingredients. The dealer spotted a flaw and forced him to pay with a jar of coins. In the end, he barely scored a few pieces of Angus beef. But that was far from his only problem. The kitchen was filthy, the staff lazy and the system completely broken. So Carmi rolled up his sleeves and cleaned every inch by hand, even scraped off the tiny black stain on the floor. Exhausted, he went home late. Dinner was just a slice of bread, no sleep, just baking tutorials until he literally passed out. Then next morning, the inspectors showed up. At first they were impressed. It looked spotless. But then they found a pack of cigarettes on the stove, just like that. The grade dropped from a to C. Still, Carmi refused to quit. He rewrote the menu, rebuilt the system and demanded perfection from every step. But the old crew thought he was crazy. No one wanted to listen.

Nathan wants to see you. I tried to wake my husband. He won't wake up. Come with me. I followed my son downstairs. I wanted to turn on the light, but he stopped me. He lit a candle. He told me to look into the mirror. Mom's here. The candle flickered. He sees you. I trembled with fear. Look at me. I couldn't bear to look directly, I threw the mirror away. My husband turned on the light, his face cold. Several people followed him in. They said they only wanted my younger son. We can Nathan back. I looked out the window. The crowd was closing in exchange. Only then did I realize my son was gone. He's gone. I tried to run, but was caught by the crowd. I passed out. When I woke, it felt like a dream. My husband and son were both beside me. Seeing the shattered mirror fragments in the trash bin, I knew last night was no dream. I secretly went to the photo studio to retrieve the pictures. Hiding in the restroom to examine them. I suddenly discovered all the photos of my youngest son had become backgrounds. I forced myself to Stay calm. I had to believe the old man's words as I prepared to leave. Mom, can I see the photos, too? I looked at my son and said the photos had developed incorrectly. I rushed back to find the old woman, showed her the photos, but nothing was captured. You believe me now, don't you? Tears Welling, I explained. Yes. The old woman said those monsters used these photos to prove he'd abducted my son. He wanted me to submit to his power. But what do we do? Take me to your son. We hurried home in the car. The old woman detailed the monster's origins along the way. When we saw my younger son, the old woman suddenly screamed in terror. Leave immediately! I was utterly at a loss. The old man could no longer escape. Then the crowd pinned the old man and me to the ground. When I woke, everything around me felt eerie. I didn't know what these strangers intended until I saw my husband and my younger son. I fainted again. A shaman approached carrying a bowl of liquid. He poured it into my mouth, then drew circles on my abdomen. Afterward, he dragged me into the water. I woke again. Reality blurred beyond recognition. My son filled my thoughts. I smashed through the blocked door, only to find my husband talking with two men downstairs. I found my little son and prepared to flee with him. But he said, Nathan can help us. You don't listen to me. I told him his brother was gone. I dragged him out of the house. My husband saw us through the window and immediately gave chase. Shouting my name. I dashed into the woods. But my youngest son vanished again in the chaos. A group blocked my path. My husband pinned me to the ground. I grabbed a rock and smashed it into him strike after strike until he could no longer fight back. I raised the rock again. Just do it. I'm too tired of going with this. Just do it! But I hesitated.

My chest hurts so much I could barely breathe, wondering why life was so unfair. Then my heart suddenly gave out and I collapsed on the street. When I woke up, I was in a hospital. The doctor gave me amazing news. Someone had donated a healthy heart to me and the surgery was done. Now I'm as healthy as anyone else and I could hardly believe it. I couldn't imagine who would help a poor girl like me. The day I left the hospital, I saw a woman quietly watching me. Her face was full of grief and sorrow. I was puzzled and quickly took a cab away. At home, my boyfriend finally returned from his trip to see me. I was so happy. But then his phone rang. It was a woman calling, and his expression changed instantly. In that moment, I realized he might have someone else. But surprisingly, I didn't feel the heartbreak I expected.

Her daughter had grown up spoiled, and recently she took her cousin's car and had an accident. She couldn't survive. I coincidentally ended up in the same hospitals, so they decided to donate her heart to me. It was the only way to let her live on now. The mother just wanted to hear her daughter's heartbeat. At that moment, I felt her pain deeply. But my own mother, upon learning this, had her own scheme. The next day, she took me to the wealthy woman's house. She looked at me as if I were her lost daughter. When I accidentally spilled wine on myself, she even offered her daughter's clothes. I thought my mother just wanted to thank her. But during the change, she asked for money to cover my medical bills. The woman didn't hesitate and gave her a large sum. Unaware, I wandered into a room playing a video of their lost daughter, and my heart raced with indescribable sorrow. Then a man rushed in and I fainted before I could speak. Luckily, I was fine. But the next day he came to see me again. He had Learned about my mother asking for money and assumed I was like her, demanding five million to never approach the wealthy woman again. It was a huge insult and I had a big fight with my mother at home. I decided to leave this greedy family forever, relying only On my boyfriend. But I found him getting engaged to another woman. I was completely alone, but at the street corner, the wealthy woman was waiting for me. I couldn't hold back and hugged her tightly. She invited me to live in her mansion. But my pride wouldn't let me stay forever. After politely refusing her repeated invitations, I left alone. No sooner had I left, the young master who once wanted me gone found me. He realized I wasn't greedy and wanted to apologize. Maybe my heart sensed the old feelings and I began to like him. But just as I stepped out of his car, my disgusting ex came angrily questioning why I was with another man.

Even when I'm working out, a few drops leak out. I hold it in. The rest of the time, I keep myself busy inside the prison, working hard. And finally, on this day, lunch comes with soybeans. I swallow them all in one gulp. When the warden walks in for inspection, I fake a choke, spit the soybeans back out. One shot. Get this damn convict away from me. Get in firmer. Come on. The doctor takes one look at me and quickly makes a diagnosis. One injection would cure it, but I've drunk so much water that I can't hold it anymore. The doctor hands me a bedpan. I laugh and tell him this thing is way too small. I need 10 of them just to get through. That's when another inmate steps in and offers to take me to the toilet. So we walk over. What nobody knows is that inside this tiny cubicle, there's a hidden passage. I climb up on the toilet, tell the inmate to stand guard at the door, and I pull out a tool I hit earlier. Done taping off, I unlock the white phone. Once I'm inside, I shut it back down, making it look like nothing ever happened. Passage leads straight to the tool room. We take out a wooden plank, slide it underneath a truck. The moment the truck rolls out, we slip into the Hollow space inside the plank. When the vehicle passes through the checkpoint, the scanners don't pick up a thing. Then at a gas station stop, we crawl out, ditch the plank and bolt toward our friend's car. Just like that, we make it out of prison alive. But inside the car, the woman driving keeps stealing glances at me.

Suddenly she used a fallen access card to escape the glass chamber. Then she fled through the aerial buildings all the way. She reached a high place suspended above the city with the busy three dimensional transportation network of 23rd century New York below. But the police had already appeared in front of her.

She told Corbin that the earth was about to be eroded by a black alien sphere and that the weapon to save the earth was located in an alien hotel in the Angel Galaxy. Driven by his sense of responsibility to protect the Earth, Corbin decided to assist Lelu. Coincidentally, Corbin had just won a grand prize. The prize was a double cruise ticket to that hotel.

A man claiming to be her boyfriend barged in, but his first words were not concerned for her. Instead, he shoved $100 at me, telling me to get out of here.

Then he grabbed the woman's neck and threatened her, saying if she dared to play games again, she would pay for it. Soon I heard the man forcing the doctors to discharge her. The doctor said her injuries were serious, but that man sneered and threatened, saying she was his girlfriend and he would decide her fate. I listened beside them, burning with anger, and I was certain she was in danger. So while they weren't paying attention, I slipped back into the room, planning to get her out. She was trembling with fear. She whispered someone was guarding the door. But I had already thought of a plan. The Next second, I pulled out a plastic bag. That's how I successfully packed her up and took her home. I told her to rest first. I went to work as usual. I didn't expect the man to come looking for us soon. He pulled out a thick wad of cash, sneeringly told me to hand the woman over. Of course, I refused. As a result, his henchmen beat me up. When I staggered back home, she saw my wounds at a glance.

Later, she even made me dinner and cleaned the whole place. At that moment, for the first time, I felt the home could be this warm. We looked at each other without words, but both understood the feeling. When I woke up, she was packing clothes. Then a stack of cash fell out of her pocket. She was stunned and questioned me where the money came from. I didn't hide it. I said it was given by that man. She immediately broke down, thinking I had betrayed her for money. She cried and slammed the money in my face. I quickly grabbed her and explained that it was just part of the plan. Only then did she stop. Not long after I took her to meet the man. When he saw us, he immediately tossed down a Big bag of cash. I pretended to be tempted and pushed her forward, but that bastard turned his back and denied it. After getting what he wanted, he ordered his men to take the money back. It turned out he never planned to give us a way out. Just as he was gloating, my coworker suddenly acted, put a plastic bag over his head. Together, we shoved him into the garbage bin. During the noise, the man's henchmen rushed in. I shouted at him that if he didn't save his boss, he would suffocate to death. The man panicked and hurried to rescue him. Taking this chance, I grabbed her and jumped into their car and we sped away.

What the hell is wrong with you? The hell is wrong with you? Sucking dick in the bathroom. Mr's mother didn't have a job to raise her two children. She had to rely on illegal means to survive. But her actions were soon discovered by the police. We have a warrant to search the premises. I'm gonna need you to sit down. Mister watched helplessly as his mother was taken away. Without any income, he couldn't afford to raise Pete, so he had no choice but to send him back to Pete's mother. I could just stay with you. He ignored the boys pleading. Just then, the neighbor opened her door. She's not home. Hi, Peter. Is there something I can help you with? Can you watch him till his mom gets here? He'd be happy too. Come on, Peter. Come on. Watching Pete leave made him feel torn inside. He decided to take one last look at the boy, but what he saw left him shocked. The neighbor was asking Pete to take off his clothes. He's filthy. He needs a bath. Let's go, Pete. Mr's anger terrified the woman and she quickly ran back into her room. She ever do stuff to you before? She makes me sit in the bathtub with my clothes on. She ever touch you? Seeing the boy's hurt expression broke Mister's heart. But there was barely any food left at home. He had no choice but to steal from stores. Just To feed Pete One day when Mister returned home, he saw the welfare officers rounding up stray kids everywhere. Stop boy. Goddamn. Oh man. Pete was caught and Mister was soon discovered as well. No officer let go. One more right there. The boy panicked and ran back home. He smashed everything in sight to vent his rage to save Pete. He felt it was time to take action. You got a job for me? What you talking about man? What you? You shrunk out. They will find your mom. She's dead. At that moment, the man didn't know what to say. You don't have to pay me. It's gonna work for free. I just want my friend at a Riverview. Even though Mister begged the man repeatedly, he still failed. I just want my friend back. Teach you a lesson that you're gonna steal it from me. We found the goddamn kid, son of a bitch. The police showed up just in time to save his life, but he still couldn't escape being sent to a welfare home where he finally reunited with Pete. Not while we're here understand. So what's up? Nothing. Who did that to your eye? I don't know their names.

They spent $100 million to create me. I fought for 40 years and was about to retire. Then one day, my commander decided to end me. The reason was simple. They had made a newer, stronger generation of soldiers. We, the old ones, became disposable. They covered up the truth. They wrote our deaths off as accidents, then dumped us into a space junk ship like trash. When I woke up, everything around me was metal and wreckage. Piles of broken machines and old steel surrounded me. Two of my brothers, gone without a breath. Before I could react, the floor started to tilt. The ship was dumping the trash. I grabbed the edge with all my strength. My arms tore, my fingers went white. But my strength ran out. I slipped and fell. Fell with the junk down to a dark, red planet. I ignored the pain in my body, crawled out from the wreckage, watched the ship's door slowly close. For the first time in my life, I felt anger. That feeling wasn't supposed to exist in me. My life was built only for obedience and killing. To win the interstellar war, the military launched something called Project Adam. They took babies with perfect genes from ordinary families. Kids like me, five years old. We were forced to watch beasts fight. They wanted survival to be in our bones. At 12, they threw us into hellish training. Anyone who fell Behind was immediately removed. Death became a warning for the rest. We had no names, no families. Only numbers carved into our faces. That was our identity. We didn't need feelings. We were taught one rule. Obey. Even if the target was innocent. That training turned us into pure weapons. Because of it, we became unbeatable. For decades, we fought across countless worlds, from earth to the edge of space. Always in the front line, never afraid, never backing down. Every impossible mission we completed. But honor and medals were never ours. We fought in the shadows. Each victory left only another scar on our skin. That was our metal. My name is Todd, captain of the soldier unit. They called me the king of soldiers. Then one day, an uninvited officer arrived at our base. He brought a new breed of genetic soldiers. Younger, faster, stronger. Perfect products of science. Our captain refused to accept it. He said experience still mattered. So they set up a test. Result was brutal. The new soldiers crushed us in a 50 kilometer run. They started 20 minutes late and still reached the finish line before me, not even out of breath. The captain still didn't believe it. He ordered a fight in the air platform. Officer Mark gave me two old soldiers to help. He said it would make things fair. But even three of us together stood no chance. That soldier moved like lightning. He wore me down, then kicked me. Off the Chain Bridge, then took down my brothers one by one. And that was just the beginning.

She's not my girlfriend. Hey! Oh, my god! Where have you been? Where have you been? I asked you what's going on? Your friend Leslie is dead. I grew up in a world that felt cold and cruel. From home to school, from strict and boring parents to bullies who made school feel like a war zone. The world kept telling me that dreams were a waste of time. That only reality mattered. Then one day, a girl named Leslie showed up. Somehow her arrival became the turning point in my life. Not long after we met, we became best friends fast. And she lived right next door. Behind our houses was a strange forest. It felt like a different world. Like something lived there we couldn't see. Then we found an old, broken down cabin in those woods. From that moment on, it felt like that place was calling to me. It was like I've been reborn. The next day, on the school bus, Leslie sat right behind me. She passed me a set of paint brushes, said it was for my birthday. I looked at them and knew right away they were expensive. But she just smiled and said, so what? On the way to school, that same bully showed up again, trash talking me. But this time, I wasn't scared. Right in front of him, I helped the music teacher carry her stuff. And in that moment, I realized guys like him just loud Paper tigers. From then on, me and Leslie went to that cabin every day. I kept wondering, how could a girl like her be so good at everything? She laughed and said, for a boy, I sure had a wild imagination. And real talent for drawing. Okay, fair. Then came the rain. Out of nowhere. I waved goodbye, wishing we had more time. Didn't know that would be the last goodbye. The next morning, my favorite music teacher called and asked if I wanted to see the museum downtown. I told my mom and got on the bus. Right before we left, I looked at Leslie's house. I wanted to ask her to come, but I stayed quiet. Never thought that'd be the last time I get the chance. It was my first trip to the museum with my teacher there. I felt like a whole new world opened up. I saw things that filled me with hope. But the second I got home, everything came crashing down. Mom ran over, crying, hugging me too tight. Turns out she never even heard me tell her I was leaving. She thought I was gone. Your friend Leslie is dead. She drowned in a creek this morning. Apparently, she tried to swim across. I think she hit her head. I didn't believe what they were saying. Not until I ran to Leslie's house and saw the police cars out front. That's when I knew it was real. The next day, my parents Took me to say goodbye, and her dad just broke down and hugged me. You know, Leslie, she never had much luck making friends in her old school. We were hoping that when we moved out here, she would. She said, if it wasn't for you, just. You're the best friend she's ever had.

The baroness whistled sharply, commanding her Dalmatians to get it back. As I locked eyes with her, memories came flooding back. She was the one. She'd used those spotted dogs to kill my mother. The Dalmatians snatched the necklace, and one of them swallowed it whole. The Baroness was furious about the bad press. Desperate to save face, she ordered her designers to create something spectacular, something that would make everyone forget about the incident. What she didn't know was that her latest fashion line was actually my work. One day, the baroness caught me sketching designs in a hidden corridor. She called me into her office and stole my designs, claiming them as her own. But she walked right into my trap. Hundreds of gleaming golden bee. It's adorned the gown, dazzling everyone in the room. The Baroness was thrilled with her masterpiece. That night, I sent two accomplices to break in, making it look like someone had tried to steal the collection. The next day, paranoid about thieves, the Baroness locked all the exhibition pieces in a vault. When the show day arrived, they discovered the vault lock had been sabotaged. With guests waiting, they had no choice but to force the door open. The moment it swung wide, a swarm of moths burst out, flooding the entire venue. Those precious golden beads. They were actually cocoons I'd carefully crafted, while the clothes Sat locked away. The insects had been hatching inside. I went home, celebrating my victory. But the baroness had tracked down where I lived. Enraged, she was ready to burn me alive. The news spread like wildfire. Fashions. Rising star. The Witch Cruella had perished in a midnight blaze. But nobody knew the truth. I wasn't dead. I wasn't dead. The Baroness's butler had saved me. Not only did he return my mother's necklace, but he revealed a shocking secret. The woman I called mother, the one who died. She wasn't my real mother. She was my adoptive mother. My actual birth mother. The very woman who just tried to kill me. The Baroness herself.

I was used to getting pushed around. My name is Jess. I'm the only boy in the family. My older sisters never cared about me. Even sneaking a snack got me yelled at. We were poor. I only had one pair of sneakers. They were torn up, but I still wore them everyday. One day after school, they were just gone. Turns out mom threw them away. She was scared people would think she was a bad parent. To make up for it, she gave me a pair of my sister's old pink shoe. I have no choice, but I had to find a way. So I grabbed the black marker and covered all the. Trying to hide what? Embarrassed, but someone always found a reason to mess with me. Sweet sneak sessions. You wear your sister's hand me down underwear, too. He asked you a question. Twinkle toes. I thought maybe this was just how life would always be. Then one day a girl showed up and changed everything. Her name was Anna. In gym class, boys started a race. I joined right away. Running was one of the few things I was good at, but Anna joined, too. The boys laughed at her for it. I didn't care. I knew I could win. As the race started, some guys blocked me on purpose, but I caught up fast. Soon I was neck and neck. Then I pulled ahead. Two strides in front, I Couldn't stop smiling. Finally, I beat the ones who always bullied me. Hearing everyone cheer, I felt like I belonged. But then Anna caught up. She ran even faster than me. I pushed myself trying to catch her, but she hit the finish line first. After the race, my legs gave up. I dropped to the ground. I shook my head at my sister. I told her I didn't win. And I walked up like nothing happened. Hey, Jess, right? But I felt humiliated. I didn't say a word. Jess left. After school. My sister and I got on the bus home. I didn't expect Anna to get off at our stop, too. I asked if she was following me. She said she lived here. Fate is weird like that. We kept bumping into each other over and over, seeing me avoid her. She offered me her favourite candy. She even caught a sketchbook. Someone threw it. This time I didn't stop her from sitting with me to look at it. Things started to change between us. After school, she sat in the back of the bus. She didn't know that C was for the school bullies. To protect her, I pulled her over to sit beside me. From then on, we were inseparable. We ran together, chasing places we dreamed of through breezy woods and spring, through glowing golden fields until we reached our secret spot. It was our own little world. That day was my birthday. She gave Me, a wooden box with a set of art pens inside. She remembered I love to draw. She remembered my birth. I couldn't help asking the question I kept inside, it must have cost a fortune. What's the matter what it costs? I don't know. Well, I can take it back and get a cheaper one if you want. Thanks a lot. Every day after we went to our castle, until one day it rained like crazy. Worried our parents would be mad, we ran home in the storm. Even in the rain, we kept talking like we couldn't stop. She asked if we'd hang out tomorrow. I told her I had something to do. We said goodbye and rushed to our houses. I didn't go in right away. I just stood there watching her. I didn't know what love was, but I knew I liked her. The next day after a museum trip, I couldn't wait to tell her everything I saw. I had new plans for our castle. I got home full of excitement, but mom ran up and hug me crying. I had no idea what was going on. My sister said they thought I was dead. I stood there. Lost your friend. Leslie is dead.

Last night, a sexy blond woman walked out of a nightclub and strangely disappeared when passing by a van. Detective Cara, who was in charge of the case, thought the parking lot was too visible and no one would possibly choose this place to attack. But Morgan gave her a lesson. The broken street lamp by the road provided darkness for the culprit and the fallen high heel heel on the ground proved that the victim must have been attacked first. Maybe she fought back with her backpack to escape, which caused the things in her backpack to fall out. And the perfume bottle shards left on the ground confirmed this. The incident happened on a Friday night. There must have been someone in the guard booth, but for some reason she couldn't call for help successfully. The two heel prints left at the scene showed that the woman was finally taken by the attacker. Then Morgan noticed that the original two heel prints eventually turned into one. This meant the woman lost her shoe during the struggle. Finally, under a car, Morgan indeed found a high heeled shoe. But the disappearance of the woman, Maya, wasn't an ordinary case. The real target of the culprit was actually Morgan. Early in the morning, Morgan received a misdelivered email, seeing the address was in the next block. Morgan kindly offered to deliver it in person unexpectedly. When she arrived at the destination, Morgan was shocked because this was the home of Maya, the missing woman. She didn't think this was a coincidence because the U. S. Postal system is extremely strict. Miss delivering an address is quite rare. Morgan believed this case must have been deliberately set up by the game maker from the previous season. After all that person seemed to have been staying around. Morgan seeing her partner so excited, Cara reminded Morgan to calm down. They couldn't handle the case based on guesses alone for now. Besides, Maya's child was anxiously looking for his mother. Where's mommy? To find Maya's location as soon as possible. The police first focused their attention on her husband because through investigation Maya had applied for a weapons permit a few months ago just to protect herself from her husband. The police quickly searched Maya's home, didn't find the gun she had bought and Morgan also noticed something wrong. Although there were many luxury shopping bags in the closet, the items inside were gone. If they had been stolen, the house didn't look rummaged through at all. Soon with Morgan's extraordinary sharpness, she pushed the case forward again. A second hand electronic organ made Morgan certain of one thing, Maya's things hadn't been stolen by anyone. Then she said she would take Cara to a place. This was a pawnshop. Morgan was a regular customer here. She greeted the Owner familiarly and exchanged small talk. While talking, she showed Maya's photo to the owner and asked if the woman had come to pawn any luxury items unexpectedly. The man didn't admit it. Morgan had to mention the second hand electronic organ in Maya's house. After all, the act of tearing off labels but not cleaning them properly was very familiar to Morgan who often came to the shop seeing he couldn't hide it anymore. The man had to admit that Maya had been there, but I can't be handing over $1,000 of goods to you. It's hard enough to keep the lights on as it is these days. Uh, the LAPD will put it on their tab. There is no tab on it. The LAPD will reimburse you from the city slash fund. Not a thing. Frenchy, why don't you just turn over the items? Otherwise I'm gonna have to fast track a warrant for a more invasive search of this place and who knows what kind of illicit goods we'll find in here. Cara's words finally made the shop owner give in. After taking out the items, he also told Morgan and Cara that Maya had come with a man at that time and the surveillance camera had captured their argument. Then in the shortest time, Maya's husband Derek was brought to the police station. the man acted as if he had just found out about his wife's incident and even broke down emotionally for a while. But Cara didn't believe his act, so she deliberately played the video of their argument at the pawnshop entrance. The man immediately became nervous and explained that he shouldn't have followed his wife. After all, seeing her constantly receiving luxury items from others, any man would get angry. But he firmly denied hurting Maya. Maya is my whole world, love of my life. And I miss my son. I, I, I, I've made mistakes, yes, but I, I would never, you have to find her. Since there was no substantial evidence that Maya's husband had hurt her, Morgan and the others shifted their focus to another person. Gib was a friend who had gone to the nightclub with Maya. They quickly got some clues from her. It turned out that Maya and her husband had been fighting a custody battle, so she had been in a low mood for a long time. But during the conversation, the woman mentioned someone that was Maya's boss, Jason, who seemed to care about her a lot. After all, the nightclub ticket was given to her by that man. Upon hearing this, Morgan quickly pulled up Jason's information. After a few minutes of organizing, she soon connected Jason to the game maker from the previous season. Again, Morgan told the result to her colleagues at the police station. So Jason and the game maker are one in the same? No, no. It's a trap, guys. I just went into the war room. It took Me like five minutes to get all this stuff off the internet. He's trying to get us to focus over here so he can keep slithering around over there. It's just too easy. This is what I think the game maker is trying to frame Jason to be a part of whatever game this is he's currently playing. This statement made her colleagues minds race. Why would that game maker go to such great lengths to frame someone else? After all, Jason and that person didn't seem to have any connection. There were too many unanswered questions. For now, the police chief had no choice but to advise everyone to follow the rules. Morgan felt a little helpless about this. Then she could only go to Jason's party to investigate with Cara first. Jason warmly welcomed them on the surface, but when they talked privately, Jason acted very cunningly regarding Maya's disappearance case. He claimed he knew nothing about it and Maya was just his subordinate. As for letting Maya use his credit card frequently, it was just because he couldn't say no to single mothers. During this time, Morgan noticed that Jason liked collecting Japanese short swords and there were even several neatly placed on the wall. But she also noticed a problem soon. Let's see, Minamoto, Tira, Toto, Ashikaga, Oda, Tokugawa. Except one's missing, the takedah. It's not there. Morgan's clever move shocked Jason, so the man became more alert. He politely asked Morgan and the others to Leave. But this action made Morgan believe the man must be hiding the truth. You're waiting on me to leave so you can poke around Jason's den without a warrant, aren't you? Yeah. However, when Morgan secretly searched Jason's study, a strange and familiar figure outside the window immediately drew her out. At this time, Cara also found a bracelet in the swimming pool, which was exactly the one belonging to Maya, the missing woman on Morgan's side. After chasing for a while, when that familiar face stood right in front of her, Morgan quickly called for Cara. And in that short gap, the man quickly disappeared from Morgan's sight. When Cara held the man at gunpoint to stop him, the man who took off his mask turned out to be Jason. Since they had obtained the bracelet Maya was wearing when she disappeared, Cara arrested Jason. As soon as they arrived at the police station, Maya's husband, Derek, angrily stepped forward to question Jason, asking where his wife Maya was. Finally, after a long period of questioning, the police still didn't get the location of Maya's disappearance. Morgan thought maybe Jason really didn't know where Maya was. She still insisted that all this must be related to that game maker. After all, she had seen that person at the masquerade party. Her colleagues still doubted if Morgan had missed seen, which made the woman with an I Q of 160 angry. Are you, are you really suggesting that I. Don't remember his face. That man is a danger to my children, okay? I'm never gonna be able to forget his face long after we're done with this, long after we get him and we put him away and you guys move on to another case. He's gonna live up here cemented inside of my brain along with all of the other things I got to look out for to make sure my kids are okay. Okay, I've got something. A salvage yard in Sun Valley just reported Maya's car. When everyone arrived at the abandoned parking lot in Sun Valley, Maya's car was indeed parked there. But when they opened the trunk, there was only Maya's clothes and a Japanese short sword inside. Realizing they had been tricked, Morgan suddenly thought of a strange point. That was when Jason was arrested and taken to the police station. Why was Derek already waiting there in advance? Usually the Major Crimes Unit wouldn't notify family members during an ongoing case, so someone must be up to something behind this. Morgan tried to sort out all the clues. She realized that when she received the misdelivered letter, everyone had already fallen into the trap. Since that game maker was so skillful, it must be easy for him to steal Jason's credit card. He deliberately gave those luxury items to Maya. After framing Jason, he threw Maya's bracelet into the swimming pool, then secretly took that Japanese short sword. And his purpose in doing this? Wasn't just to frame Jason because Maya had registered to buy a weapon earlier, but that gun had never been found. That meant the person wanted Derek to think Maya had bought a gun. Did you know that Maya recently purchased a firearm? What? The game maker knew Derek would want revenge, so he placed a gun in Maya's house after we searched it. It's possible Maya was just faking. She could still be alive. I hope so. But if she's not part of the game anymore, he doesn't need her. Look, we did everything we were supposed to do, right? We played the game. We played it his way. None of the other victims died. Maybe he's not a murderer. Not if he got someone else to do it for him. So it's Jason. He wants dead. We gotta find Derek. When Cara arrived at Derek's house, it was already too late. Derek had already gone to Jason's house. And at the police station here, an even more shocking scene unfolded. Apparently, you're looking for me.

She began to suspect that her mother might not be human at all. Every time she went out, her mother always took a bore with her. But every time she came back home, her mother looked completely exhausted. Strangely, the boar was nowhere to be seen. And every time her mother returned, there was always a pile of dirty laundry that never seemed to end. This scene sparked a strong curiosity in the girl about her mother. So while her mother was washing dishes, she carefully asked where the boar had gone. But her mother impatiently broke something, seemingly trying to avoid the sensitive question. The more she did that, the more curious the girl became about her mother's secret. The next day, her mother went out with the boar as usual. The girl quietly followed her. Unexpectedly, her mother had also brought her sick father along. The two of them held the boar and walked deep into the forest. The girl followed cautiously, but in the next moment she saw a scene that terrified her. Her father was kneeling on the ground, his neck tightly chained by her mother. It was as if they were performing some kind of mysterious ritual. After her mother left, the girl quickly slipped through the gap under the iron gate. In the next second, she saw another scene that filled her with unimaginable fear.

The noise not only disturbs them, but can also be heard by everyone in the whole building. To improve their married life, the next day, while her husband is out, Mary goes to her male neighbour, who works as a clown in a circus, and asked him to crawl under the bed to repair the springs. But with the bed stationary, the clown can't figure out what's wrong. So he asked Mary to sit on the bed and keep shaking her body to make the springs move. Soon, the bed starts shaking, but the clown still can't spot the problem. Mary thinks maybe her weight isn't enough, as the springs only make noise when her husband is on top of her. She invites the clown to sit on the bed with her and shake it together to better figure out the issue. The clown doesn't think twice and sits beside Mary. They start shaking the bed and sink, and this feeling makes Mary feel something strange. Her body starts to heat up inexplicably. Sure enough, after they shake the bed for a while, the clown quickly finds the problem based on the different rhythms. He takes out an oil can, pour some oil on the springs and fixes the issue. Mary is very grateful to him. However, just as the clown is about to leave, Mary sees that the children from the upstairs neighbor's house have used a hook to snatch the clothes she hung out to dry and are playing with them. Then they casually throw the clothes and they happen to get caught on the street light in front. Mary gets very angry and starts scolding the two kids. Unexpectedly. When the clown sees this, he immediately takes out a strange looking tool from his pocket and throws it at Mary's clothes. When he pulls the tool back, Mary's clothes fall down smoothly. Seeing that the clown has helped her again, Mary develops a strong liking for this man. Even the way she looks at him becomes full of longing.

Little did she know Jack was hiding in the corner, peeking at her. Anna's sexy figure made Jack's body burn with intense heat. Just then, Jack suddenly caught sight of Anna's ice cream truck and in a split second, he came up with a great way to get close to her. The reason he acted this way dated back to that morning. As usual, Anna had gone to the beach to sell ice cream when she stopped to take a break. Halfway through, Jack accidentally caught a glimpse of her sexy figure and fell for her right away. At that moment, Anna, completely unaware of his presence, walked past Jack from behind. The sweet scent emanating from Anna made Jack's body flush with heat instantly. So after ice cream, Jack started following her. When he saw Anna's ice cream, Jack came up with a brilliant plan. He snuck into the truck's cabin while Anna wasn't looking.

Even though the food was right in front of me, it was just out of reach, so I had to inch forward on my hands. I finally grabbed it and scrambled back into the yard, not daring to linger for a single second. I was serving a 14 hence Besant House Harris, sentenced with an electronic ankle monitor. Stepped past the front door and the alarm would sound and they'd haul me back to jail. That night, though, the ankle monitor glitched. The cops called and said the blizzard had knocked out the surveillance system and would come back online at 7 the next morning. They said they'd swing by to check. I was ecstatic. I could hardly believe it. So I took advantage of that brief freedom and tore onto the highway, driving like a maniac. The storm had driven visibility down to almost nothing. When I looked back, I couldn't stop in time. I hit someone. I got out and kicked the person lying on the ground. There was no response. Suddenly, another car came up behind me, so I shoved the body into my trunk and climbed back in like nothing had happened. After the other car drove off, I called a friend and told him I was on my way. I showed up at his place and spilled everything, begging him. To help me deal with the body. He wasn't thrilled at first, but finally agreed. Together, we dragged the body to a tree and shoved it into a hollow at the roots. Just as I was telling him I needed to go home and get some rest, there was frantic pounding on the door. He fumbled a handgun out of a drawer. Roads were closed by the storm and a late night visitor usually meant trouble. We opened the door to find someone collapsed on the threshold. And when we leaned in to look, we recognized him immediately, the same person we just shoved into the tree hollow.

I want to file a complaint. It's illegal to charge more than what's listed on the price tag. Jason immediately checked the price tag on the bag. The customer is always right if it's listed at $200, and that's how much it cost. Even though Mary clearly stated that the current price was wrong, Nick still chose to side with the customer. Lisa got what she wanted, but things were far from over. Give me the bills. What? You screwed up on the price tag, so pay up. That would be my entire salary. Hopefully you learn your lesson and this won't happen again. Come on, give me the money. To keep her job, Mary had no choice but to compromise. Losing her pay made her deeply upset.

I frantically turned on the faucet and got him into the bathtub. He still looked like he was in agony. It suddenly hit me he needed salt water. I quickly dumped all the mineral salt into the bath. He gradually started to recover. To make sure the salt level stayed high enough, the artist and I agreed we need to stock up on more tomorrow. I taught him to read pictures and words like a teacher would, carefully marked the calendar. This was when the canal locks would open to the sea, the perfect time for him to return to the ocean. To avoid suspicion, Zelda and I kept to our regular work schedule. With the creature missing, the supervisor interrogated everyone at the facility. He checked our time cards but found nothing suspicious. He figured janitors wouldn't have the guts to pull something like this. As I was leaving, I signed, you're an asshole. The already irritated supervisor got even more pissed off. What is she saying? She, she is saying thank you. Zelda quickly stepped in with an explanation and he finally let us go. When I got home, I found the artist slumped on the floor. He'd been watching over our guest and had worn himself out. He dozed off from exhaustion, starving, the creature had crept into the living room. The cat hissed at the stranger. He hissed right back. By the time the artist heard the Commotion and came running. The cat was already dead when the artist tore into him. The creature realized he'd messed up badly. As he bolted, he accidentally slashed the artist's arm. The artist told me to find him fast before he caused any more trouble. Following the bloody handprints on some flyers, I tracked him down to the empty movie theater downstairs. I brought him back home and quickly tended to the artist's wound. The creature was deeply sorry for what happened. To make amends, he placed the artist's hand on the scales at the top of his head. The mysterious blue light glowed instantly. Then he moved the hand to the artist's wound. The artist felt what seemed like electricity spreading through his body, but he didn't think much of it. The next morning, the artist woke up to a shock. His bald head was now covered with thick hair. He couldn't believe his eyes. He ripped off the bandage on his hand and found the wound had miraculously healed. Meanwhile, I was spending time with the creature. As I touched his body, a strange sensation washed over me from the inside out. He reached toward my clothes. Startled, I turned and left. But that electric feeling stayed with me. I made a decision that defied all logic. I walked back into the bathroom, deciding to follow my heart and let things unfold naturally.

The doctor was getting frustrated. He still thought I was making things up. I kept telling the doctor I didn't have a husband and I hadn't had a boyfriend in ages. Seeing how insistent I was. He pulled out a couple strands of my hair, planning to run some kind of psychological test to see if maybe I'd gotten a boyfriend without being aware of it. But I stood my ground. The doctor went ahead and tested my hair, but the results came back totally normal. He thought I might have split personality disorder, so he asked me how I've been sleeping. I told him I slept just fine, except I always woke up feeling exhausted and worn out. And my ex husband, who lives downstairs, he'd been calling me lately, wanting to get back together after hearing all this. But the doctor seemed to have figured something out. He had me spend the night in the hospital sleep lab the next day looking at my brain waves. He noticed they became extremely active after midnight. That's a classic sign of sleepwalking. The truth finally came out. Turns out I've been sleepwalking to my ex husband's place every night, which explained the pregnancy and the hickey. The doctor suggested I just go home and remarry the guy, joking that I couldn't even keep my ex out of my dreams. Then he prescribed me some medication to help treat my sleepwalking problem.

This was our plan to smuggle the $5 million we'd stolen out of the country. But there was so much money that I had to wrap the rest tightly around her stomach. Before long, she looked like she was eight months pregnant. If we could just make it through airport security, we'd have more money than we could spend in several lifetimes. To avoid suspicion, we deliberately entered the security area separately, one after the other. Sure enough, when the security staff saw she was pregnant, they waved her through without asking many questions. But just as my girlfriend glanced back at me, I was suddenly stopped by an officer. She looked nervous, but had no choice except to keep her cool and keep moving forward. Turns out my passport had no entry or exit stamps. Fortunately, I stayed calm and after some quick talking, managed to ease the security officer's suspicions. Next came the most critical part. The full body scan, or hearts were in our throats. If anything went wrong, not only would our whole plan fall apart, but we'd be fat being life in prison. I thought we'd covered all our bases. But to my shock, the moment my girlfriend walked through the metal detector, a piercing alarm blared. My heart nearly stopped. Thankfully, my girlfriend Janna quickly removed the necklace from around her neck, which resolved the crisis and allowed her to pass through without further incident. To avoid drawing any more attention, we picked up our pace. Thinking about how we'd soon escape the law and start our new lives as wealthy people, we couldn't help but smile.

I grabbed it and just before it exploded, I hurled it back. But to my surprise, the next morning I woke up completely unharmed, put on the same blue shirt as yesterday, stepped out into the street, then got shot dead on the spot. Yet the next day I came back to life again. This time I met a beautiful woman on the street. Something about her hit me instantly. Love at first sight. Just as I was about to walk up to her, a train roared past blocking my way. But it did matter. After all, I die and come back every single day because I'm just an NPC, a background character in this game world programmed to repeat this same routine. Put on the blue shirt, drink my coffee and head to the bank for work. In this world, the people wearing sunglasses are the real players, poor like me. Without them, we just end pieces destined to leave. Inside, someone else scraped. As usual, I waited for the players to rob the bank. A few sacks opened fire. It is seen it all before. Calmly, I hit the ground and even started chatting with the security guard. Then suddenly I saw her again, the same girl from yesterday. My heart raced. I wanted to chase after her, but every move I made was restricted, bound by invisible code. I tried to borrow a player and sunglasses. He Punched me instead, but somehow I managed to snatch a pair. And from that moment on, everything changed. Throughout those glasses, I could see things, icons glowing everywhere. A med kit appeared on the ground. I touched it and my wounds healed instantly. When players went down, cash spilled out of their bodies did up and my bank balance shot up. So I went shopping, bought the sneakers I could always wanted. But my strange behavior didn't go unnoticed. The programmers started watching me. They thought a hacker had broken into the system, so they entered the game themselves to erase me. When I realized I was being hunted, I ran for my life. In a moment of panic, I noticed a button on my shoes. I hit the switch and leapt straight up to the 8th floor. But the programmers were fast. They were right on my heels. With nowhere left to run, I jumped again. They couldn't stand it anymore. They started rewriting the gaming code, building walls and barriers between the skyscrapers, chased me relentlessly, but the path ahead was gone. I had no choice but to dive into the void below. I tried to grab a rope but lost my grip. In that split second between life and death, I selected the shield icon and somehow I survived, escaped their pursuit. In the end, even in this game, I was still just at one NPC.

With each collision of the pillars sending vibrations through the ground, the floor beneath them suddenly vanished and they fell into the pit below. When they came to, they found themselves inside the legendary golden fortress. Before they could even process it, the steps beneath their feet began rapidly retracting inward.

However, the old man beside them seemed completely unconcerned. He walked over to a dust covered door, then pulled out a crystal ball. According to legend, this very crystal ball was the key to the golden fortress. The man glanced at the groove on the door and Immediately realized what to do. Slowly he lifted the crystal ball above his head. In the next moment, the door began a chain reaction. Within seconds, a secret passage appeared. The group carefully stepped inside and the scene they encountered was beyond belief. Golden light radiated from every corner and even the walls were constructed from solid gold bricks. Several crystal statues were arranged around the room. Then the group noticed something unusual. They approached one of the statues and saw that a portion of it was missing. A teammate immediately held up the crystal ball again, but in that instant, the unexpected happened.

He not only betrayed our marriage, but quietly moved all our assets. I never thought he could be so cruel. But I vowed my revenge would be ruthless. I went straight to his mistress's home. I told her parents that their daughter was having an affair with my husband and she was pregnant. That bomb shattered everyone. Then I filed for divorce. I took back every asset he had moved. Got nothing. Not a penny. Not even custody of our son. He was humiliated and furious. He swore to get revenge. I thought he had no more moves. But he went to the hospital where I worked. He reported me to my boss. He lied that I threatened a patient's family. He smeared me as mentally ill. And he demanded the director fire me. But the truth was, the man had long abused his wife. If I had once warned him that if he kept hurting her, I would take him to court. Now those two joined forces against me. My husband kept insulting me. He said I was broken by my parents, failed marriage. I lost control and slapped him. He used that

At first, I thought some kid was playing a prank. But when I peeked to check, I realised the culprit was my neighbour. So to get back at her, I rushed over and pounded on her door. Just as I was about to confront her, I saw the obvious bruise on her arm and it hit me right away. Maybe she was using that to signal for help. So I swallowed my anger. I made a couple of polite remarks and plan to leave. But right after the door closed, I immediately called the police. Before long, cops showed up. Her husband was taken away for domestic violence. I thought it was finally over. But when she came to thank me with a grateful smile, I noticed part of the bruise was missing. That felt off and made me suspicious and her expression turned cold in an instant. She didn't say another word. Then she just shut the door. In that moment, I felt a strong sense of unease. So I decided to find out the truth. I quietly snuck into her house. What I saw next shocked me to the core. The injuries on her body were all staged. What chilled me even more was a strange man walked out of the room. They smiled at each other and they casually let the truth.

I make everything look like nothing happened. The passage laid straight out of the bathroom. We grab a wooden plank and slide it Underneath the truck, as soon as the truck starts moving, climbs into the hollow space inside the plank. When the vehicle passes through the checkpoint, the scanners don't pick up a thing. At the gas station, stop, crawl out. We ditch the plank and run straight for our friend in car.

But my daughter did something that made him turn pale. It was Thanksgiving at his parents house and I should have known better than to show up with store bought dinner rolls. For eight years of marriage to Derek, I had Learned that everything had to be perfect in front of his family or there would be consequences later. But I had been pulling 12 hour shifts at the hospital all week and barely had time to shower, let alone bake homemade bread. His mother, Patricia, made the first comment. As I set the plastic container on her perfectly set dining table, she lifted one roll with her manicured fingers like it might contaminate her entire meal. Well, she said loud enough for the entire room to hear. I suppose not everyone has time for family traditions anymore. 22 family members were crammed into that dining room. His parents, both brothers with their wives, six kids ranging from toddlers to teenagers, and various aunts and uncle who had driven in from neighboring towns. All of them turned to stare at me like I had committed some unforgivable sin. I forced a smile and explained that I had been working overtime at the hospital. Three nurses had called in sick with the flu and someone had to cover the emergency department. I thought they would understand. His father was a retired police officer. His Brothers worked construction. They knew about demanding jobs. But Derek's face was already turning that familiar shade of red that meant trouble was coming. His jaw clenched the way it always did when he thought I had embarrassed him. The vein in his temple started throbbing. You always have an excuse, he said, loudly enough to cut through every conversation in the room. The football game on TV suddenly seemed too loud. Someone's fork clinked against their plate. One of the toddlers asked for more juice, but nobody moved to help him. All eyes were on us now. I'm not making excuses, I said as calmly as I could manage. I'm explaining why I didn't have time to bake this week. That's when he hit me. The slap echoed through the dining room like a gunshot. My cheek exploded in pain, and I could taste blood where my teeth had cut the inside of my lip. The force of it knocked me sideways, and I had to grab the back of a chair to keep from falling.

Derek had never liked her, always complained that she was too mouthy, too independent, too much like me for his taste.

But my daughter did something that made him turn pale. It was Thanksgiving at his parents house and I should have known better than to show up with store bought dinner rolls. For eight years of marriage to Derek, I had Learned that everything had to be perfect in front of his family or there would be consequences later. But I had been pulling 12 hour shifts at the hospital all week and barely had time to shower, let alone bake homemade bread. His mother, Patricia, made the first comment. As I set the plastic container on her perfectly set dining table, she lifted one roll with her manicured fingers like it might contaminate her entire meal. Well, she said loud enough for the entire room to hear. I suppose not everyone has time for family traditions anymore. 22 family members were crammed into that dining room. His parents, both brothers with their wives, six kids ranging from toddlers to teenagers, and various aunts and uncle who had driven in from neighboring towns. All of them turned to stare at me like I had committed some unforgivable sin. I forced a smile and explained that I had been working overtime at the hospital. Three nurses had called in sick with the flu and someone had to cover the emergency department. I thought they would understand. His father was a retired police officer. His Brothers worked construction. They knew about demanding jobs. But Derek's face was already turning that familiar shade of red that meant trouble was coming. His jaw clenched the way it always did when he thought I had embarrassed him. The vein in his temple started throbbing. You always have an excuse, he said, loudly enough to cut through every conversation in the room. The football game on TV suddenly seemed too loud. Someone's fork clinked against their plate. One of the toddlers asked for more juice, but nobody moved to help him. All eyes were on us now. I'm not making excuses, I said as calmly as I could manage. I'm explaining why I didn't have time to bake this week. That's when he hit me. The slap echoed through the dining room like a gunshot. My cheek exploded in pain, and I could taste blood where my teeth had cut the inside of my lip. The force of it knocked me sideways, and I had to grab the back of a chair to keep from falling. Complete silence fell over the room. Not one person moved. Not one person spoke. His father stared at his plate like it held the secrets of the universe. His mother suddenly developed an intense interest in folding and refolding her napkin. His brothers exchanged a quick glance, but immediately looked away. Even the children had gone completely quiet.

To make use of his ability, the black king threatened him with the life of his mother. He forced Magneto to use his power to move a coin. But Magneto failed to do it. After several attempts. His mother stood beside him, encouraging him that he could do it. Magneto tried with all his strength. The coin still didn't move. Then Magneto flew into a rage. Instantly, his superpower erupted completely. He forcibly crushed the helmets of the soldiers nearby. Right after that, he turned the entire room into a mess. The Black King was very satisfied to gain such a gifted mutant. Before leaving, he even gave the coin to Magneto. But the idea of revenge had already taken root in Magneto's heart. When he grew up, he searched everywhere for the black king's whereabouts. He first found the black king's men. He acted decisively at this moment. Someone pointed a gun at him. He activated his superpower immediately. He controlled the man's gun to aim at others. He successfully took down these men. And he also found out where the Black King was. That night, Magneto found the ship where the Black King was. When he appeared in front of the Black King, he didn't expect that the Black King's bodyguard was also a powerful mutant. The woman attacked his mind with telepathy. Then he was knocked off the cruise ship. But he didn't give up. He controlled the Anchor to crash into the Black King's cruise ship. Time to go however, the bottom of the cruise ship could actually transform into a submarine. He tried his best to control the submarine, but by this time, he was already exhausted. If he didn't stop, he might drown. In the end, Professor X successfully rescued him underwater. But he still didn't

The woman turned and hurried away. Yes, he deliberately targeted a woman wearing two layers of formal attire. His goal was to cause a commotion in the casino, allowing him to steal the dice from the gambling table unnoticed. He left the scene, entered the restroom, removed his laundry and sprinkled it over the shoe shining machine. A makeshift polisher was complete. He polished the corners of the stolen dices 4 and 3 until smooth, ensuring he could reliably roll a 7 every time. Returning to the table, he casually tossed the dice and won $10,000 again. As a stack of chips grew, the casino owner took notice. The owner sent a beautiful woman to inquire about his identity, only to hear a name that rang a bell, James Bond. Spotting the owner approaching the table to investigate, he quickly and secretly replaced the dice with a normal pair and threw them naturally. This time he lost. He prepared to leave, but the owner picked up the dice for a closer look. He seized the moment to toss the rigged dice into his juice. Without evidence of cheating, the owner had no choice but to exchange his chips. But just as he was about to slip away, a server brought his juice. The owner picked up the cup and discovered proof of his cheating. His companion, realizing his peril, immediately feigned a collision with the owner's bodyguard, creating an escape route. He sprinted down the stairs, slammed the door shut and used a cable to secure the handle, trapping the boss outside. Facing pursuers armed with guns, he hid behind a liquor cabinet and sabotaged the coolant valve. The cabinet crashed precisely onto the attackers. He calmly exited the casino, met up with his companion.

Come on, baby. Oh, look at that. Oh, you're sweet, baby.
