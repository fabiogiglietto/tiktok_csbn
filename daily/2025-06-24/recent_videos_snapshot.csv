Gypsy and Nick met on a dating website for Christian singles in 2013 when Gypsy was 21 years old. They spoke for two years strictly online, developing a relationship in which they starting a new life together, including getting married and starting a family. They then met for the first time in person in 2015 when they went to see the movie Cinderella. Their second in person meeting was in June of that year when Nick Godejohn traveled from Wisconsin to Missouri to act out their plan of killing Gypsy's mother, Deedee. Godejohn would later say that he believed killing Deedee it was both imperative to ensuring he and Gypsy could spend their lives together. On June 9th, 2015, after Deedee fell asleep, go to John entered the house and while Gypsy hid in the bathroom, he stabbed Deedee Blanchard to death. The two of them skipped town together and stayed in hiding for the next four days until eventually police caught up to them. The couple were then arrested and charged with Deedee Blanchard's murder. 2016 Gypsy Rose pleaded guilty to second degree murder and got a sentence of 10 years in prison. Nick Godejohn, on the other hand, was charged with first degree murder. At his trial in 2018, there was no dispute whether Godejohn was the one to actually kill DD, but his attorneys argued That he had been manipulated by Gypsy with this argument. They attempted to get his charges reduced to second degree murder, but they were unsuccessful, and in November 2018, Nick Godejohn was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. His sentencing hearing in February 2019, go to John said quote, I was blindly in love. That was always very much the case. Goda John had no history of violence, and it's reported that after the murder, he was very upset. In fact, he later told ABC 2020, quote, I felt horrible about it when me and her were in the hotel room and Gipsy kept on telling me, stop crying, there's no reason to cry, he said. I did what I did because I loved her. I really wanted a life with her. Later in 2019, Nick go to John gave an interview from prison for an oxygen special. In that interview, he said that him and Gypsy were soulmates. He said, those five days when I was actually with her, physically with her, those five days were the most intense and magical and inspiring days I've ever had. He also said, somehow I just knew deep within my heart, some way me and her would end up being together in the end. He said that's why he committed the murder. He wanted to make sure her mom was not going to harm her anymore. Go to John is currently serving his life sentence at the Potosi Correctional Center in Mineral Point, Missouri. In August 2022, he was in court asking for his conviction to be set aside and for a new trial to happen on the grounds that he had ineffective counsel, but in March 2023, his motion to vacate, set aside or correct judgment and sentence was denied. He will be remaining in prison for the rest of his life.

Your scalp probably feels tight when you brush your hair. If you're shedding more than usual in the shower, if your ponytail feels thinner than it used to, you might think it's just a symptom of aging. Or it's your hormones acting up. And most people over the age of 40 tragically ignore these symptoms until one day they realise it's too late. As you age, your body stops producing the very nutrients your hair depends on, mainly vitamin B12, zinc, biotin and iron. Then the shedding happens. Maybe you've told your doctors about these symptoms, but they will never tell you that this is a warning sign of something deeper going on in your body, because keeping you sick makes them billions of dollars. Um, but there's a natural healer I've been recommending for years to the people who come to me at 40, 50 years with hair falling off by the loads. And six weeks later, they always come back in tears, thanking me because they look like a new person. Their hair, their nails and even their skin is glowing. They look much better. This natural remedy is a blend of vitamin B12, zinc, biotin and iron that support healthy hair growth. It helps you replenish your body with all the nutrients your hair depends on. Just one dose of this natural healer every morning could Help you strengthen hair from the root, speed up growth, reduce thinning, bring back shine, support a healthy scalp, and best of all, make your hair feel like you're in your 20s again. And it's all thanks to this one powerful natural remedy that I started using myself a few years ago. It's made by a small company called Rosabella. If you read the thousands of reviews, you'll see why everyone buys only from this brand. Most people buy it at $29 per bottle, but right now they're doing a small seasonal sale where you can buy a bottle for under $15 for a limited time. The only problem is that they're a small company and they're getting popular, so they can't keep up with the demand. So I want to apologise because if you click the orange button, you might see that they're sold out and my patients have waited for months before they found them again. Um, but I suggest you click on the orange button so you can see for yourself if they have anything left.

Yeah, of course. No problem. Excited to dive into wedding planning? You seem kind of upset. Yeah, I just figured this conversation would be easier in person. I had quite a few questions. Questions about what? That bridesmaid email you sent out last night. There were a lot of requests in there that I just don't feel comfortable with, and I really couldn't tell if you were joking or being serious. Well, it's an email. Of course I'm being serious. Why would I joke about that? I sent that in an email so everybody had it and could refer back to it. Okay, well, there was three things on there that really stuck out to me. So what, Tiffany, you're just gonna try to back out after you said you were gonna be a bridesmaid? You know, I really wanna be there on your wedding day, but some of these are really ridiculous. Like what, Tiffany, they're all doable. First off, you wrote in here that you want everyone to dye their hair brown or black because you wanna be the only blond on wedding day. I really don't think I'll be doing that. Come on, Tiffany. Hair dye is temporary. Right after the wedding, you can get yours back to blonde. Temporary or not, I do not wanna dye my hair. Next on the list, I would prefer that you do not get engaged or pregnant during my season. Of being a bride. That one really threw me for a loop. Well, yeah. You're only engaged once, you're only a bride once, and it's only for a year of your life. So you're telling me if I got pregnant, you wouldn't want me in your wedding? Well, we're having the conversation now, silly. So we won't have

And recently, Mia's husband told her after 27 years of marriage, that he was leaving her for his new mistress. Oh gosh, I can't imagine what that feels like. 27 years of marriage. God! He also informed her that he would be kicking her out of their house, which they had purchased together as newlyweds, and the mistress would be moving in. Out with the old, in with the new. Oh, Mia, do not lay down and take that. So Mia was obviously devastated, especially because she had raised kids in that house and made a lot of memories there. Yeah, and it's her home. That's her home, man. Not anymore. New lady's home. Mistress is home. Gross. But her husband made her a financial offer that she couldn't refuse. So she accepted the money deal and agreed to move out so that he could have the house with his mistress. Alright. And on her last night in the home, Mia decided to celebrate with a huge bottle of champagne and a giant platter of shrimp caviar and oysters. Oh, way to go, Mia! Might as well go out with the party, you know? Hello. Yeah. The next day, Mia's husband and his young mistress moved in. And things were going perfectly for about a week. Uh huh. And then something changed. Uh oh. That's when they started noticing an awful Smell? Oh, no. Throughout the entire house. Oh, what you do. It was pungent, rotten, and ammonia scented, they say. Oh, like chemically. It was in every single room of the house, too. What? And they couldn't figure out what was causing it. At first, they thought maybe an animal had gotten into the attic and died. Uh huh. So they brought in exterminators and found nothing. Then they thought maybe it was mold, so they brought in a mold specialist, and no mold was found. Okay, that's already a lot of money there. It. Yeah, right. Like, they're in debt big time at this point. They're spending a lot. They cleaned all the carpets, replaced the entire central air and heating system. Again, expensive. Wow, that is expensive. It replaced it all. I thought for sure it was like fish in the ventilation system, and that didn't even work. They even installed an expensive ozone generator for the air filter to try to get rid of the smell. But no matter what they did, nothing got rid of the stench. And soon the husband and his mistress were having fights because of it. Yeah, I mean, nobody. Can you imagine living with a set? I mean, they described it as a set of a dead animal. Yeah. In your house 24 7. And obviously for a while if they got all that work done in the meantime. Right. The only thing that's changed is you moved in. It's gotta Be you. I didn't know you smelled like rotting animal. Uh, they were frustrated and disgusted, obviously, because they couldn't figure out where the smell was coming from or why it smelled so bad. So they decided to put the house on the market and just move on. Oh, my god. And, well. And how do you sell a house that stinks? That's exactly everyone that comes in. I mean, you're not gonna be able to sell it for any money. It's exactly what the real estate agent told them. The horrible stench, it's gonna be a major problem for perspective buyers. Yeah, and would drive the price down considerably. But they didn't care. They just wanted to get out. There's a sign outside. Must have no sense of smell. Right? Right. Hazmat suit available. Here's your gas mask to tour the home. Finally, they got an offer on the house. It was extremely low, but they needed the funds to move out and had no other offers, obviously because the place smelled so bad. So they took that extremely low ball offer. Oh, my god. And it turns out that offer was from Mia, the ex wife. Shut up! Who wound up purchasing her house back at a huge discount. Shut up! Oh, my god. God. And also remember, he made her a financial offer. So the money she's using to buy the house was the money he gave her to leave her house so the mistress could move. In. So he bought her the house. And this is pretty much all legal. And Mia. You're so smart. I love her. The day Mia moved back in, she also

I mean, you will be on your 30th okay of the unskippable lecture, and your mom is still rage baiting you. It's like, you'll say, okay, and then she'll hit you with the, but it's not okay! And it's like, my brother, you are about to catch a Mike Tyson left hook from me. Or better yet, I'll say, okay, and then she thinks I'm giving her attitude, and it's like, yo, mom, news flash! I'm not just gonna be like, affirmative, mom, with a big, fat, fucking jolly smile on my face. And don't even get me started on when parents say, don't talk back to me. What the fuck are you talking about? Like, I don't know if you knew this, but we are having a conversation. Talking back to each other is how this whole thing works. And if you ask me if I understand, and I hit you with the yes, and then you hit me back with the no, you don't, why the fuck are you even asking me then? And I cannot stand when they tell me to watch my tone. Like, hey, dumbass, all I said was okay! In a monotone voice. Y'all ever be doing something? your parents ask you to do the thing that you're already doing, and it's like, I don't wanna do this shit no more. Now you'll forget to do the simplest thing, like just Taking out the trash, and here comes your mom talking about some, oh, I guess I'm a bad mother. Nobody cares about me. And it's like, motherfucker, what? Nobody said that. And last but not least, the ultimate form of rage baiting is when you're walking away from them and they whisper behind your back like you can't hear them. Like, how about we hop in the ring right fucking now and handle this like men?

Hi, can I speak to Ricky, please? This is Ricky. Hey, Ricky, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. This is what? Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. The radio show. What is that? The radio or the radio show? Cause the radio is a device that you can listen to a lot of things on music programs. I know what a radio is. Why are you calling me? Oh, I'm calling you today because one of our listeners emailed us about you. Somebody that you know very well. Okay. I mean, you have a puppy with her. You should know who it is. What? Why are you asking all these questions? Well, I'm asking you because we do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. So you recently went out with Becca. Okay, yeah. Becca. All right. Uh huh. Okay, that sounds funny to you? I don't know why? And she emailed us because she said she's been trying to get a hold of you since you guys hung out all day. You bought a puppy together, you spent the night together, and then you were gone. And she doesn't know why you're not calling her back. Okay. And now you just want to talk about this? Well, yeah, cause. Yeah, pretty much. You're not. She doesn't know. She doesn't know what's happening. She thought that. I don't know, that something maybe bad happened to you. She Wants to know why you're not calling her back. Well, I mean, does that even matter? Of course it matters to her. It matters for sure. You guys, like, you bought a puppy together? Yeah. All right, I mean, that's my thing. What do you want me to say? What do you mean it's your thing? You stayed the night and you wrote her a note that said, Love, Ricky? Yeah, I mean, that's kind of guy I am. You know, you might get a puppy. You're probably gonna get a puppy. I'm so confused. What? I don't. All right, I mean, if you. You gotta know, like. Yeah, I like to buy girls puppies. Wait a minute, though. That doesn't make any sense. You kept the puppy? Do you have like 80 puppies at your house? I don't know. It's my move. It's what's what? You know, it's my thing. You want me to talk about it? I mean, what, you never heard of something like this? No, I've never heard of a dude that just meets women and buys them puppies. Of course he didn't, cause that's what I do. Okay, wait, okay, well, how do you. What do you do with the puppy afterwards, though? That's the question you took. She told us that you spent the night and then you were gone, and so was the puppy. Yeah, I have this arrangement with my friend. He works at a pet store, you know, and It's. He sees me walking with a girl at the pet store. He knows that there's a particular puppy, you know, and I give her the puppy. Works every time. Wait, I don't get it. Works for what? You. You know, you pick. You want to pick up a girl, you give her a puppy. Hahaha, it's true, I guess. But it doesn't make any sense. You were already out to lunch with a girl before you bought the puppy. I mean, you already picked her up. It's a first date move, though. Like, you know, you know you're gonna seal the deal if you give her a puppy. It works like a charm, honestly. They love it. Oh, so wait, you're trying to get off a puppies? I'm not trying to. I do. Yeah. I mean, we only know one person that's come in contact with you, and it worked with them. It always. It always works. Oh my god, dude. Okay, that is evil. You are using puppies. What? I mean, dudes walk dogs and they get to meet girls when they're walking the dog. I mean, I just give them the dog. Oh, I'm cutting out the walking part. What happens to the puppy though? You know, in the morning, I bring the dog back. I bring the dog. I bring the dog back to the pet store. Yeah, my friend takes it back. Oh my god. What? Am I gonna take care of this thing? You're Crazy. Bring it back. But Ricky, do you understand what you're doing? Like, you're doing more than just getting laid. Like you are roping these women into believing that you wanna have a future with them. Whatever. If we went out to dinner, am I making a commitment to eat dinner with you for the rest of my life? No, but you're not taking care of dinner for the rest of your life together as a. Like, it's joint custody of a puppy. Come on, if you believe that we're gonna have a whole life together just cause I gave you a puppy. I mean, in honesty, that's really stupid. Oh my god, now you're calling her dumb? I mean, come on, you just meet this guy in the first day, you're like making plans for the rest of your life based on a puppy. I mean you. You have to be a moron. Well, Ricky, after that, I would like to tell you that somebody wants to talk to you because Becca is on the other line and she just heard everything you said. Mike.

I'm serious. It's old, stuffy, boring. We need to change it. We? You mean me, the only parent who actually showed up? Look, my mom passed away, and I wanna name her Mary. Yeah, that's a no from me. What do you mean, no? That's my mother's name. You can keep Elizabeth or Laura as a middle name, but Mary has to be first. The audacity, the confidence, the N E R. You know what? Never mind. I'm her father. I get to say. Where was this big dad energy when you blocked me for 10 months? Oh, my god. Let it go. I can't change the past, but you can prevent me from hating this name forever. Oh, no. Not your feelings. What about the fact that she knows her name? This is about compromise. You compromised your role as a father when you disappeared like a bad magic trick. Poof! I'm trying here. And I even said she can keep your last name. That's proof I'm being reasonable. Wow, such sacrifice. Would you like a cookie? Just rename her. It's not too late, bro. She knows her name, unlike you, who just Learned she exists. You're being so petty. And you're being so blocked.

It's not like we spend that much of their money, right? Hmm. That's actually an interesting question to unpack. I feel like it's just emotional manipulation. Why blame us if they can't manage their money? How much do you make per month? Right now, about three, 200 dollars after taxes. Why? Is that enough for your expenses? Yeah, it covers my rent and bills, and I have a bit left over. How many times a month do you treat your boyfriend to dinner? Why would I need to treat him to dinner? You've never treated him? Not once? Maybe once or twice, I guess. What about holidays? Have you ever sent him money or bought him gifts? Wait, what are you getting at? Aren't those things guys are supposed to do? Exactly my point. What's that supposed to mean? Since we're on the topic, let me break down the math for you. Takes you out to eat twice a week. That's normal, right? Yeah, totally normal. Let's say you go somewhere basic, like Applebee's or Chili's. That's at least $60 for two. Which isn't much, right? Nope, that's reasonable. So that's $120 a week, which is $480 a month. On other days, if you're just grabbing quick food together, that's maybe fifteen dollars per person. So thirty dollars total. Three times a week is $90, which is three hundred and sixty dollars a month. And there's coffee and Drinks? He buys you, what, three Starbucks a week? That's not much. I get coffee almost every day. At minimum, that's $15 a week. $60 a month. And movies. You probably see two movies a month, right? Yeah, that sounds about right. That's around $30 per ticket with popcorn. So $60 for both of you. $120 a month for holidays or special occasions. Probably sends you at least $100 or buys gifts worth that much. Yeah, that's true. Add all that up and you get $1,020. That's the baseline monthly cost of dating for a guy. And that's assuming he doesn't buy you gifts regularly and you're a reasonable girlfriend who doesn't expect fancy restaurants. Now let's talk about his own expenses. Rent and utilities are probably twenty fifth hundred dollars minimum, right? Sure, that's reasonable. He needs lunch at work, maybe twelve dollars a day. So about two hundred and forty dollars a month. Transportation cost around a hundred and fifty dollars a month. All these basic expenses add up to 3,000 ten dollars. That all seems normal. If he lives this way for a month, spending 3,000 $10, not only would your monthly income not cover it, you'd actually go into debt. But you can't compare me to him. Guys are supposed to make more money anyway. Okay, let's say he makes 40 five hundred dollars a month after taxes. After those three thousand dollars in expenses, he has 1 thousand four hundred and ninety dollars left. But That's assuming he doesn't buy you any gifts that month, doesn't have any social obligations, doesn't buy himself any clothes or personal items, doesn't get sick, doesn't need to help family, and doesn't have any habits like smoking. Any unexpected expense. And he's broke. So you're right. You haven't spent that much of his money directly, and he hasn't bought you many gifts. So why is he broke? Why? Because relationships need those moments that make you feel special. He needs to show his love. And almost every gesture of love, every special moment, requires money. Without those gestures and moments, would you still be with him? Probably not. Here's the thing, and I'm not exaggerating. Before he started dating, he could eat whatever and wherever he wanted. But now, do you know what he probably eats when he's alone? What? Probably fast food. Value meals or meal prepped. Rice and chicken. Do you know why? Why? Because he can only be generous with you if he's frugal with himself. I'm not trying to make you feel guilty. I just want you to understand what your boyfriend is going through when you're not around. It's tough being a guy sometimes.

But it's part of the community. We all enjoy it. Do you enjoy cleaning beaver dams or shoveling silt? We're getting yelled at by farmers when it floods their fields. Uh, no.

I'm not destroying it, I'm upgrading it with native grass. You're welcome. We don't want grass, we want the pond! Cool, then pay 10 k a year to keep it. 10K? Are you crazy? Nope. That's what it Cost to keep your precious pond from turning into Beaver Disneyland. Why can't you just do it for free? Because I'm not your personal pond maintenance guy. Wow. You're ruining everything for money. Yep. I'm literally getting paid to make my life easier. What a tragedy. You're such a selfish asshole. And yet I'm the one who's been doing all the work while you stare at the pond. Funny how that works. This is unbelievable. Now, what's unbelievable is that I didn't fill it in sooner. Enjoy the grass. You're impossible. And I'm done. Bye.

Hit a spoiled brat? I worked as a waiter at this upscale restaurant during college, the kind where entrees cost more than I made in a shift. We had this regular customer, Veronica, who was about 17 and the daughter of some tech CEO. Every Friday night, she'd roll up in a car that cost more than my tuition, with a different group of friends demanding the best table without reservations. The manager always gave in because her father spent thousands there entertaining clients. Veronica had this habit of sending back perfectly good food, claiming it was inedible after taking two bites, changing her order multiple times, and making servers run back and forth for ridiculous requests like water with exactly three ice cubes. It's not for. She'd leave her table looking like a tornado hit it. Makeup smeared on our cloth napkins, food deliberately spilled. And the worst part, almost never tipping despite keeping us an hour past closing. One server, Maria, got fired after Veronica complained that she looked at her wrong while serving. Maria was a single mom working three jobs to support her kids. The final straw came during graduation season. Veronica arrived with 10 friends without a reservation during our busiest night of the year. Every table was booked weeks in advance by family celebrating their graduates accomplishments. When the hostess politely explained we couldn't accommodate them, Veronica exploded, screaming that she was more important than these commun community College losers and demanding we kick someone out. She whipped out her phone, calling her father and putting him on speaker, expecting him to threaten the restaurant. I was cleaning a nearby table and watch the whole scene unfold. The hostess was nearly in tears as Veronica screamed that she'd get everyone fired. That's when a man at a nearby table stood up. He walked over, calmly introduced himself as Daniel Morgan, and asked to speak with Veronica's father, who was still on speaker phone. Veronica smirked, thinking this random diner was about to get humiliated by her powerful dad. Hello? This is

He was the type of guy to believe that a son's greatest influence is seeing how much love his dad gives his mother. And he always gave without asking for anything in return. On his birthday, he cooked dinner in a full suit and tie. It was her favourite homemade pineapple pizza. It must have taken him almost four hours to make, but said it was worth it because our happiness was his happiness. I expected her to sit down and shower my dad and gifts while we ate, or at least surprise him with a birthday cake. But instead she just laughed and said, I could have sworn your birthday was next month, before shoving the pizza right into her throat and squealing with happiness like a pig. Another time, he gave her a just because cause gift. It was a diamond necklace she had pointed out three years prior that she'd seen in a magazine he'd been saving ever since and waiting for this moment for years. After opening it, she hugged him super tight and thanked him. But that's where her gratitude ended, because he asked if she wanted to wear it to the date he had planned for them that night. Um, tonight is actually my girl's night. We've been planning this all week. Sorry. He then proceeded to Help her put the necklace on before watching her pair it with the skimpy this dress known to mankind to throw it back with her ratchet friends at the club. As soon as the door closed, my heart shattered because my stoic, nonchalant ex army general dad had a tear rolling down his face. He tried to wipe it away in time, but it was too late. I had already seen it. So even when he went to his bedroom and closed the door to signal that he wanted to be alone, I. I did open. How long are you going to keep acting like this is okay? I asked, voice shaking. His face went ghost white, and I knew he was embarrassed. Dad, it's okay to show feelings sometimes. Get the F out! His voice was cold, unforgiving. But I knew it would be my only opportunity to finally talk some sense into him, so I stayed. Couldn't even lock eyes with me without fiddling his thumbs around the frayed seams of the blanket. Son, your mother just struggles with voicing her appreciation. But trust me, I know she loves me just as much as I love her. This should have been enough. But it wasn't. The entire time, my dad's eyebrows were raised super high, something he only does when he's lying. And I knew I had to do something, so I hosted a dinner party. You see, there was this couple that lived near us who were The complete opposite of my parents. The husband would still woo his wife with her favourite snacks, jewellery or makeup. Instead of just shutting all over him, his wife would surprise him by getting up early and mowing the lawn for him in the way that he likes. They spent every evening together fishing and laughing like best friends. I knew they were the perfect people to show my dad exactly what was going on, so I invited them over on Thanksgiving. My dad was the one to open the door. The wife, Samantha, brought over homemade baked goods and ice cream, while the husband brought gifts for everyone. Very expensive looking gifts at that. I knew my plan was working when this alone was enough to shake up my dad. And while we were all eating dinner, Samantha cuts his steak before serving it to him while he gently wipes a crumb from her cheek without saying a word. Meanwhile, my dad looked over his shoulder to see my mom scrolling on Instagram with the volume all the way up, not even eating anything because she already had a huge breakfast with her girls that evening. After the couple cleaned up the entire dinner together, including the mopping and dishes, it happened. My dad finally hit my mom with confrontation. Of course, he started off by gifting her with a Thanksgiving gift of a huge bag of those expensive dry freeze candy. And when she responded with okay, thanks He responded with they were pretty expensive. My mom just stared.

But you're scared of getting caught. Congratulations, you're back on Criminal TikTok. Today I'm going to show you how to do it like a pro. So don't forget to tag that friend who'll be your target. Step number one. Make them comfortable. Don't take them straight to a shady place. What about hosting a video game night at your place? Drinks and a cool vibe so everyone can relax. Step No. 2. The perfect spot for the operation. Your own living room. Yeah, buddy. With all those cushions and couches, nobody will think about what's going to happen. And with the sound of the console, a little game of call of duty, who could hear anything else? Step No. 3. Remember, no need to be a surgeon to do surgery. When your friend falls asleep on the couch after an intense game and a few beers, that's your moment. Remove the organ, drain the blood, and plunge it straight into a cooler. Yes, the one you prepared in advance, filled with ice packs. Step No. 4. Now for the business. Option 1 find an urgent recipient through reliable contacts, always remaining anonymous. Option 2 jump into the online black market. Cryptocurrencies will be your best friends for staying anonymous. But make sure you don't give away, like, two hearts or four kidneys at the same time. That's too suspicious and you'll get caught immediately. I say this from experience. And don't forget To like and follow to stay on criminal TikTok

Like a ridiculous amount. And at first I was like, who is this girl that keeps texting you? And he told me he was asked to train her and if she had any problems or questions, she was supposed to call him and reach out. Okay, no problem. But now the problem is that it seems like she's texting him a lot. Like it is increased, it's a lot more lately. And it's not always during work hours. So he always says something like, oh gosh, this girl has a lot to learn or something to that effect. And now I'm not sure, it's always work stuff that they're texting about, cause he's. It's all the time. So you think maybe this work relationship is now more of a. What, a romantic one? Yeah, I. She's not just reaching out 9 to 5, so I don't know, I, I just feel like she text at more random times, not just during work times, you know? Yeah, but have you asked to see any of the text messages? Like, have you been like, what's so important that she has to text you on a Saturday? Not really. I mean, okay, he is my boyfriend, but he is not my husband. I feel like if we were married, I'd be like, alright, give me your phone right now. We're not. Hey, have you met This other girl. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We once ran into her and her friends. Okay? And, I mean, she's not ugly, she's pretty. Okay, I, I don't really like her that much. Why is that? Does she give you, like, a bad vibe? So she was really, really excited to see my boyfriend Kirk, but when he introduced us, she was just kind of like, oh, hey, and blew me off. What is this girl's name? It's Jasmine. Okay, and Kurt. You said that's your boyfriend's name? Yeah, yeah, his name is Kurt. Okay, so what do you want us to do? You want us to find out if this work relationship is something more than just work? Yes, but here's the trick. I don't want either of them to know that I'm involved. I don't want to come off as Crazy Girlfriend, so I'm just trying to keep everything on the down low. Okay? I got you. Well, that's pretty much what dirty work Wednesday's for. So do you have this Jasmine girl's number? I don't know. Okay, okay, so texting her is out, and obviously calling her is out, too. I, I mean, I can try and get it from him, but I feel like that would be weird, and he would ask me why I wanted it. No, no, no, it's okay. I mean, we can go a different route then. Um, maybe we just call him instead. What, what is he up to this morning? Is he around or no? Yeah, he should be around. I'm pretty sure he's off today, so. Okay, well, then let's call him. Let's. Well, what are we thinking of saying here? I say we run the old birthday gambit on him. Uh, okay. What's the birthday gambit? I'll explain it to you during the break, cause you're actually gonna have to be the one that does it. Uh, okay. Yeah, then I'm definitely gonna need you to explain this to me. Okay? Yeah. Steph, hang on a sec. We'll get Kurt's number from you, and then we'll call him when we come back next. All the hits, Z 1:04. So let's see how this works out. Hello? Hey, I'm calling for Kurt. Yeah, this is Kurt. Hey, Kurt. Um, listen, I'm not sure if you remember meeting me. Uh, my name is Natalie, and I'm a friend of Jasmine's. Oh, hey. Yeah, I was with her when we ran into you one night when we were out. Anyway, there's a reason I was calling. Do you, like, have a quick second for me? Yeah, sure. so a bunch of us are planning a birthday party for Jasmine coming up, and we're putting together a guest list. Anyway, we were trying to figure out who to invite, because we want, you know, make it special, a great night for her. And so we were like, hmm, you know, who would Jasmine want at her party? And my friend Kara That said, just grab her phone, go through her contacts. So that's how I got your number. And a little random, but yeah. I just wanted to. I know. I just wanted to know if you wanted to come to the party we were planning for her. Yeah, sure. When is it? Well, we're still trying to figure that part out, but I'll put you down on the list of people.

I come in late, it's not good enough. All you do is yell and scream and criticize and go after anything that I try to do. I can't cook anything correctly. I work really hard for you, and you don't care! And all you do is criticize! You throw a potato at me! You're the worst person I've ever met! I can't take it anymore! Are you finished? No, I'm not finished, because you're evil and you make everyone around you feel like crap! You've been my manager for the last 6 months, but guess what? You're not gonna be my manager anymore because I quit! Go fuck yourself! I quit! Now are you finished? Yeah, now I'm finished. Well, will

Your cell phone rings and you don't recognize the number. What do you do? Ignore it. Ignore it? Don't answer it? Not me. I like life. The other day, my cell phone rang 9 1 7. That's a New York number. I didn't know who it was. I picked it up anyway. I hit talk. I said, hello. Guy in the line goes, hey, Bruce, what's going on? My name is Jay, not Bruce. So I said, nothing much, man. What's going on with you? And he said, I'll tell you what's going on. I just got an email about the budget. It's supposed to be 15,000, now it's 10,000, and I'd like to know what's up. I got excited in my chest. I grabbed the steering wheel. I was like, okay, focus. Your name is Bruce. There's a budget. It was 15,000, now it's 10,000. No one's happy about it. That's all we know. That's all we know. So I just repeated back to him what he said to me, and I go, 10,000 is supposed to be 15,000. He goes, yeah, I know. Well, I just got an email, and now it's ten. I go, listen, man, I don't know what to tell you. I've been on the road all day, you know, I haven't even seen it. And he goes, did you send this out? I give him some attitude to Bruce. I didn't like it. I said, listen, man, the budget was 15,000. We had a Couple extra expenditures. It went up to 16 2. I reworked it, got it down to 14 7. I had 300 to play with. So I called it 15, and I sent it out. And he goes, yeah, well, now it's 10, man. And I was like, oh, my god. That worked. That worked. Phase one complete. Phase one complete. Like, now I'm in the door, I have a 4:01 k. I was at the Christmas party, okay? So he goes, did Larry okay this? I go, listen, man, I took the budget to Larry. Larry said it looked fine, but I knew it was my ass on the line. So I ran up by Jennifer just in case, just a double check. Jennifer said it looked good. I sent it out. He goes, yeah, well, now it's 10, man. And I realized this guy has no idea what's going on over there. He hasn't talked to Larry. I know he hasn't talked to Bruce. He doesn't even recognize my voice. I know he didn't talk to Jennifer. I just made her up. So he goes, listen, man, what are we gonna do about this? And I go, listen, I'm on the road right now. I haven't even seen the email. Why don't you give Larry a call, check in with him, see what he says, call me back. Just praying he will, because that return phone call was going to be amazing. And he goes, you know what? Why Don't wait till you get home. You check the email. You call Larry, you call me back. And I go, nah, nah, bro. Larry knows way more about this than I do. Give him a call, call me back. He goes, okay, hangs up the phone. To which I explode with euphoria because there's a small business in New York that is crumbling to the ground over five grand, and nobody can find Jennifer. They're looking. They're looking. I get home, I'm so excited. I take out my cell phone. I'm like, you know what? I'm gonna save that guy's number, give him a call in a couple days, touch base, you know what I mean? Check in, see where we're at, you know? So I save it in my phone under random guy. That's what he is. He's a random guy. Four or five days pass. I forget about it. Laying on my couch watching the ball game. Phone rings in the dining room table. I get up, watching the game. Grab the phone, watching the game, look down, random guy.

What's your story? Last year, I was pulling double shifts at City General Hospital, working myself into the ground after a brutal 18 hour shift in the ER. I was basically a zombie. My apartment was 40 minutes away in the opposite direction, so I always crashed at my buddy Jake's Place downtown. He gave me a spare key months ago and said, make yourself at home whenever. Stumbled up to his front door at 6 a m. Completely dead on my feet. The key was under the mat, like always. I walked in, kicked off my shoes by the door, and barely made it to the spare bedroom before collapsing face first onto the bed. I was out cold in seconds. Six hours later, I woke up to someone staring at me. Not Jake. A woman sitting on the edge of the bed, holding a cup of coffee, just watching me sleep. My heart nearly exploded out of my chest. Who the hell are you? I shot up in bed, still in my scrubs. She didn't scream or freak out. She just tilted her head and asked, do you know where you are right now? That's when I looked around the room. Different curtains, different furniture. Definitely not Jake's place. Walls were painted yellow instead of white. There were plants everywhere. Female clothes hanging on a chair. Oh, my god. I started panicking. I'm so sorry. I thought this Was my friend's house. The key was under the mat, and I just. Jake moved out three weeks ago, she said calmly. I'm Emma. I live here now. My brain couldn't process this. The key was there. The door was unlocked. I left it unlocked because my plumber was supposed to come fix the kitchen sink this morning. I guess you got here first. I felt like the biggest idiot on the planet. Here I was some random guy in scrubs who just broke into this woman's house and slept in her bed for six hours. She had every right to call the cops on me. I was at work when you came in, she continued. I got home about an hour ago and found you passed out. I wasn't sure if you were dead or just really tired, so I've been sitting here trying to figure out what to do. Why didn't you wake me up sooner? She shrugged. You looked exhausted and you're wearing a hospital badge, so I figured you weren't some random creep, just someone who made a mistake. I showed her my ID badge and explained the whole situation about Jake never telling me he moved. Actually started laughing. That sounds exactly like something Jake would do. He left half his stuff here when he moved out, including this weird exercise bike that I can't figure out how to get rid of. We ended up sitting in her kitchen drinking coffee and laughing about how Awkward the whole thing was. She told me she was a teacher at the elementary school down the street. I told her about working at the hospital and how Jake was the worst friend ever for not mentioning he moved. He probably forgot, she said. When I met him during the apartment handover, he seemed pretty scattered. Nice guy, but definitely not the most organized. Before I left, she gave me Jake's new address. Turns out he moved literally two blocks away but never bothered to tell anyone. The weird part is Emma and I kept texting after that. She would send me pictures of weird things Jake left behind, like collection of rubber ducks or a half finished puzzle of a cat. I would send her pictures of crazy stuff from the ER. We started hanging out on purpose instead of by accident. Coffee dates, movie nights, walks around the neighborhood. She was easy to talk to and didn't judge me for being a complete mess most of the time. Eight months later, I was her plus one to her cousin's wedding. The cousin turned out to be Jake's new roommate. When Jake saw us together, his jaw hit the floor. Wait, you two know each other? Emma grinned and said, yeah, he broke into my house and slept in my bed. It was very romantic. Jake looked confused until I explained the whole story. Then he felt terrible for not telling me he moved, but Emma just laughed. And said it worked out perfectly. If you had told him, we never would have met. Sometimes the best things happen by accident. Two years later, Emma and I got engaged. Jake was my best man, obviously. During his speech, he said he took full credit for our relationship because his forgetfulness brought us together. Emma's maid of honor was her sister, who roasted Jake for being the most unreliable wing man in history. The whole wedding party was cracking up.

So I did. I worked at support at this small software company. Nothing fancy, 40 employees, basic office setup, cheap coffee that tasted like burnt rubber. My boss, Amina, was this quiet Pakistani woman who spoke English, Urdu, and German fluently. He'd been there five years and never caused drama. Our sales team constantly dragged her into client calls last minute. German clients loved talking to her in their language. Clients would light up when she switched to French mid conversation. She'd explain technical stuff they couldn't understand, translate error messages. Basically save deals that were falling apart. Then Brad became VP of sales. First week on the job, he called Amina into his office. I was fixing his computer when he told her she wasn't allowed on client calls anymore. Your IT support, not sales. Stay in your lane. Amina just nodded and went back to her desk. No argument, no drama. Just started staying in her cube when sales needed help. Week 2, chaos started. This German banking client called about API integration issues. Their whole marketing campaign depended on our software working perfectly. Sales guy Jake tried explaining the technical limitations, but kept messing up the terminology. Client got frustrated and hung up. They launched their campaign anyway. Cost them 2 million euros when our API couldn't handle their traffic volume. Exactly what Amina would have warned them about if she'd been on the call. Jake tried Calling back, but the client wouldn't pick up. They were furious, threatening legal action. Week three, French client Marseille Finance called about data export problems. Sarah from sales got on the call, but she doesn't speak French and they barely spoke English. 20 minutes of confused back and forth before they hung up and sent an angry email saying they were switching to our competitor. Brad kept blaming outdated documentation and unclear product specs in team meetings. Meanwhile, I'm in a quietly fixed bugs, answered support tickets and said nothing about the calls. She wasn't allowed on anymore. Month two got worse. Korean client needed urgent help with their payment gateway integration. Sales had nobody who spoke Korean. They used Google Translate over email for three days while the client system stayed broken. By day four, the client hired a different company and demanded a full refund. That's when the CEO Michelle noticed something weird. In the quarterly report, client retention dropped 15%. Support satisfaction scores tanked. Three major accounts threatened to leave. Board meeting time. Brad came in with a presentation blaming everything on legacy system limitations and inadequate technical resources. Said we needed to hire more sales engineers and upgrade our servers. Michelle asked if anyone else had thoughts about the retention problem. Amina raised her hand, first time she'd spoken up in months. May I show you something? She pulled up her laptop and showed call logs, email threads, technical tickets. Pointed out exactly where language barriers Caused confusion. Showed examples of clients asking technical questions that sales couldn't answer. Explained how small miscommunications snowballed into contract cancellations. I used to help bridge these gaps, she said quietly, but I'm following my job description now. Room went dead silent. You could hear the air conditioning humming. Michelle stared at Brad. You told her to stop joining client calls? Brad tried backtracking. Well, we need clear role boundaries. She just showed us. We lost half a million in revenue because of your clear role boundaries. Two weeks later, Emma got promoted to international client success manager. Raise bigger office equity package. She started joining calls again, and client satisfaction jumped back up. Brad transferred to internal process optimization, basically managing spreadsheets in the basement with no client contact.

When my grandpa died last year, I expected maybe a few thousand dollars and his old fishing gear. Instead, I got his entire estate, $3 million, plus his house and investments. A lawyer made me promise to keep it quiet until I turned 25, which was still eight months away. So I did. I was dating Michelle at the time. We met at a food bank where we both volunteered. She was this artsy girl who painted murals and always wore thrift store clothes. She'd roll her eyes whenever her roommate bought expensive makeup and say things like, money just makes people shallow, and I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and fake. I believed her. I mean, she knew I worked at a grocery store making 12 bucks an hour and still wanted to hang out with me. She'd pay for our date sometimes because she made more money teaching art classes to kids. She seemed perfect, but then little things started bothering me. Like how she'd always forget her wallet when we went out with my friends who had better jobs. Or how she'd hint about wanting expensive stuff, but frame it like she was joking. Wouldn't it be crazy to spend $300 on shoes? Like, who does that? She'd say while staring at designer boots online. One night we were watching this movie where a guy finds out his girlfriend only dates him for money. Michelle laughed and said, that's so gross. I could never be with someone just for their bank account. But then she paused and added, though I guess it would be nice to not worry about rent all the time. I decided to test her. I told her my cousin was getting married and needed a plus one. The wedding was at some fancy country club. Michelle got so excited about going somewhere classy that she bought a 200 dollar dress. She couldn't afford the wedding. She kept asking my cousin's husband what he did for work and making comments about their gorgeous house and expensive cars. She barely talked to me all night. She was too busy networking with the rich relatives. That's when I knew, but I wanted to be absolutely sure, so I proposed. Figured if she really loved me, she wouldn't care about money, right? She said yes, crying and everything. Then I told her I wanted a prenup. A what? She asked, still wiping her tears. Prenuptial agreement. You know, just to protect both of us if things don't work out. She laughed. Jordan, you work at a grocery store. What exactly are you protecting? I kept my face straight. I might inherit some money someday. Plus you always say money doesn't matter to you anyway. She agreed immediately, said it was totally smart, and showed I was responsible. I drew up a simple prenup that basically said if we divorced, each person keeps what they Brought into the marriage, nothing crazy. Two weeks later, I handed it to her to sign. She read it, and her whole face changed. Wait. This says I get nothing if we divorce? Only if you don't bring anything into the marriage, I said. He told me money doesn't matter to you, so this should be fine, right? She stared at the paper like it was written in another language. But what if we're married for, like, 20 years and then split up? I'd have nothing. You'd have whatever you earned during those 20 years, and your art and your happiness, since money doesn't matter to you. She got quiet, real quiet. Then she said she needed time to think about it. Days turned into weeks. Every time I brought up the prenup, she'd find an excuse. She had a headache, she was stressed about work, she needed to ask her sister about it. Then she started crying randomly. Said the prenup made her feel like I didn't trust her, that it was insulting and unromantic. He'd guilt trip me by saying things like, I thought you loved me, and this feels like you're planning our divorce before we're even married. But I didn't budge. I just kept saying, if money doesn't matter to you, then this shouldn't be a problem. Finally, after six weeks of stalling, she exploded. Scream that she couldn't marry someone who didn't trust her, and that the prenup was proof I never really loved her. She threw the ring at me and stormed out. I was actually relieved

Her name was Jasmine, and she wore silence like armor. She sat in the second row of my 10th grade English class. Second seat from the left, closest to the wall. That's where she stayed. Never spoke unless called on. Never raised her hand. She turned in every assignment early and perfect, but never attached a single note or question. If I handed back essays with praise, she'd take them wordlessly and tuck them into her folder without making eye contact. Most students fade in and out. Jasmine didn't fade. She disappeared. No photos in the yearbook, no friends at lunch, no small talk in the halls. Still, she was impossible to ignore. One day in November, I gave the class a personal narrative prompt. Write about the most important moment of your life so far. Most kids wrote about birthdays or trips or siblings. Jasmine turned in a single page titled Wednesday. It wasn't poetic. No metaphors. Just a timeline. 6:00am alarm. Didn't sleep. 6:00am. Heard him downstairs. Waited until he left before showering. 7:00am burn on my left hand from stove. Hit it under my sleeve. 8:00am. Late to school. Told the office I had a dentist appointment. That was it. There was no climax, no conclusion. Just a quiet report of a morning that felt too specific to be fiction. I didn't know what to do with it, so I marked it a plus and slipped A sticky note inside. I'm here if you ever want to talk. She didn't reply. But the next week, she started staying after class, pretending to pack, slowly asking questions that barely needed answers. By December, I Learned she had no cell phone. By January, I noticed she wore the same coat every day, even indoors. In February, I figured out she never brought lunch because she didn't eat at school at all. Then one afternoon, the fire alarm went off unexpectedly during sixth period. Everyone filed out fast, but I couldn't find Jasmine. Not outside, not in the stairwell, not with her classmates. Finally found her crouched in the janitor's closet on the third floor, hands over her ears, face pale. I'm not supposed to leave unless I know where he is, she whispered. I didn't press. I just sat with her. The next day, she was absent. And the day after that. On day three, I walked to the counselor's office and asked for help. They said she wasn't listed under any emergency contacts. No working phone number, no listed address. Just a name and a forged signature on enrollment papers. Took a week for social services to step in. It took one night for everything to fall apart. That same week, I got a letter in my mailbox at school. Handwritten, folded into quarters. No return name. Just a sticky note stuck to the front that said, from Mister Lane. I'm sorry I didn't say goodbye. Inside, Was a three page letter from Jasmine. She explained that her mother died when she was 12, that her stepfather had moved them five times since then. To avoid questions, he taught her how to lie to landlords and forge documents, that she wasn't allowed to speak to other kids, that school was the only place she felt safe, and that I was the first adult who had ever waited for her to finish talking. That spring, I kept her chair open. Her name stayed on the roster. I left it there long after she was gone. Two years later, I got a letter from a group home a few towns over. She passed her GED and was applying to colleges. Said she still hated writing, but finally understood why it mattered.

I was forced to leave the school in handcuffs, but it was worth it, seeing that 15 year old bleed everywhere. When I started teaching at my school district, I noticed that we had a lot of teen moms. We have so many, in fact, that we actually allow them to bring their child to class as part of our inclusive continued education program. As long as the child can stay quiet, they can stay in class. If not, they have to go to the school daycare. Even though we had a lot of teen moms, no one in a million years would have expected that Annie, who had a 4 1 GPA, would come back to school pregnant after summer. Annie was every teacher's favorite student. She was smart, witty, and wasn't the kind of girl that got pushed over. She was a star athlete on the basketball and LaCrosse teams and took a lot of pride in hosting safe parties for everyone. For all we knew, Annie wanted to work for the FBI, and she probably will, too. But when she had her baby, everything tanked. She started sleeping in class, and she was barely coasting by academically because she was so tired that she never got the time to study. All of her friends who were jealous of her, suddenly all turned on her and beat her down over the fact that she's a teen mom. As her homeroom teacher, I did my very best to make sure that I was always on her side, no matter what. I came to school with baby food stocked in a mini fridge, diapers in my drawer, and little rattles for the baby to play with. Even though I did my best to give her support, her classmates made it impossible, especially what they did to her on Halloween. During Halloween, we usually have our quarterly exams, so that means everyone's studying extra hard to pass. Unfortunately, Annie is an overachiever, so she tried to study harder than usual to get her usual grades, but that took a massive nose dive. During lunchtime time, she fell asleep while feeding her baby, and when she woke up from the bell, her baby was gone. She had a public freak out and started screaming, crying, and throwing food because no one would tell her where her baby was. She saw some kids laughing and screamed, asking where they put her baby, and they

My family had this super weird rule that I never understood until years later. We were never allowed to use the front door of our house. Like, ever. Not for anything, not when leaving for school, not when friends came over, not even when we ordered pizza. Everyone had to use the side door that LED through our mudroom into the kitchen. T B H. It was embarrassing of as a kid, when friends would come over, they'd naturally walk up to the front door and I'd have to awkwardly redirect them like, oh, no, sorry, we don't use that door. And they'd give me the weirdest looks. I remember when I was like eight, my friend Amara came over for the first time and went straight to the front door. My mom saw through the window and literally ran to intercept her before she could ring the doorbell. She practically dragged her around to the side entrance while giving this awkward explanation about family tradition and house rules. Poor Amara looked so confused and probably thought we were in some weird cult or something. Lol. The front door wasn't broken or anything. It was a perfectly normal door with a deadbolt and everything. Sometimes I catch my mom staring at it with this weird sad expression, but when I asked about it, she changed the subject super fast. My dad was even More intense about it. If any of us kids even joked about using the front door, he'd get this scary, serious look and say, we never use that door. End of discussion. The side door thing became such a huge part of our family identity that I just accepted it as normal after a while. Like, I stopped questioning it. Our house was on a corner lot, so the side door faced the street. Anyway, we had this cute little stone path leading to it with solar lights and everything. My parents put a lot of effort into making the side entrance look welcoming, but I still couldn't help wondering about the front door. It was this big mystery in my life. When I turned 16, I had this huge party planned, and I was so stressed about explaining the door thing to all my new high school friends. I finally broke down and begged my parents to just tell me why, so I could have a better explanation than it's just our family rule. We looked at each other for a long time, having one of those silent parent conversations, but they still refused to explain. My brother Joshua thought it was because someone had died there. My sister Brianna was convinced our house used to be a drug den, and there were secret police cameras watching the front door. We came up with all these wild theories, but none of them seemed to fit. The real breaking point, Came when I was 18. My uncle Ryland came to visit with his new wife, who none of us had met before. No one told her about the door rule. She arrived while we were all in the backyard having a BBQ and used the front door. The instant the doorbell rang, my mom dropped an entire plate of food, and my dad knocked over the grill trying to get to the door. It was absolute chaos. By the time they reached the front door, my uncle's wife was already inside, looking completely bewildered at the mess. In the backyard. She could see through the window. My mom burst into tears and ran to her bedroom. My dad just stood there frozen, staring at the open front door like he was seeing a ghost. My uncle looked so confused and kept asking what was happening. But my dad just quietly closed the door and took everyone back outside. That night, I heard my parents fighting for the first time ever. My mom was crying and saying, it's been almost 20 years, Frank. Maybe it's time to let it go. My dad kept saying, I can't. I just can't. I had never heard him sound so broken. I left for college a few months later, and the door mystery was still unsolved. Every time I came home for breaks, we still used the side door. It had been 19 years of this nonsense, and I was determined to finally get answers. Last Christmas break, I decided I couldn't take it anymore. I sat both my parents down and told them I wasn't leaving until they explained the front door rule. I was an adult now and deserve to know what they told me. Absolutely broke.

When I was 11, my mom trusted me with all her heart. Because by that age, I had already Learned how to do my own laundry, how to cook a meal with only three ingredients, and how to wrap a tight blanket around myself at night. So it felt like someone was holding me. And it's not like my mom was absent from the home or anything. She just spent all her time locked in her room working on her art. And as for why her art was never enough to pay the bills, I just figured that she trusted me enough to make budget friendly choices. So even when I woke up in the middle of the night to gumshots or the 100 degree heat in summer, because we had no a C, I felt a sense of deep pride. And whenever I went to my friends houses, I always cooked the entire house dinner. And they'd wake up to the house SPIC and span. Counters wiped, sofas hovered, even got the dollar bills that fell in between the cushions. They'd always say things like, wow, your mom must be an incredible woman with how well she raised you. And I'd respond with a huge beaming smile. Yes is the best. No one ever questioned why I was so underweight, why I wasn't able to sleep in a bed and instead always opted for the hardwood floor. Why I couldn't even get through a Sentence without apologizing. Always just thought I was mature and polite. So one day, when my mom came out of her room for the first time in days, I lunged towards her. Mommy, look at my report card. The teacher said I did really good. That's nice, honey, she said with a sigh, her tobacco breath burning my nostrils. You tell Mommy what day it is. Wednesday. I thought if I could make myself seem cheery enough, then she would finally love me in the way I wanted. Until suddenly she started thrashing around the place and punched a hole in the drywall. Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! I thought it was effing Thursday. I thought the payout was today. When I walked up to her, she lifted her fist as if she was about to take her anger out on me. So I made sure to speak really quickly. Mom, I have 20 bucks. Immediately her face softened. Honey, you are the kindest, most mature girl a mother could ever ask for. But I didn't have time to save her the moment, because as soon as she snatched it from my hand, she walked over to the store to buy art supplies, came home, and went back to working on her art. Now, you may be wondering where I got the $20 from. Well, there was this rich kid at school who always had lunch money. He was mean to everyone anyway, hitting on kids that looked poor. I started To keep a mental record of who I could take from and when. All for those brief moments when mom would emerge eating another $20, another $40, another fix of her art supplies. And like all preteens breaking the law, I got cocky. And after just three months, Miss Lee caught me. I already knew what was going down when she called me into her office. Thought she was going to call the police or at least scream at me. But no. Instead, she asked me questions. Not an interrogation, more like making conversation. Her what's your favourite food? Me rice with ketchup. Her what do you and your mom like to do for fun together? Me sometimes, the day after she gets her government check and she does art in her room, I sit by the crack in her door and talk about my day. Her what time do you go to sleep at? Me at 2:00am, when my mom goes quiet. The entire time, I had a smile on my face. Just happy to talk to an adult that cared about me. But when I looked up, I saw it, her eyes filled with tears. She told me to wait there while she went to go get someone, and handed me a Nintendo Switch to keep me occupied. And two hours later, I heard a knock on the door. It wasn't just Miss Lee, because it was Miss Lee with two police officers and a lady in a Suit who said she was from Family Services? They all had the same look, like they were trying to smile but couldn't quite manage it. Sweetie, we're going to take a ride to your house. The lady said we need to check on your mom. I began hyperventilating. No!

My grandpa gave me a bag of rocks for my 15th birthday, and I thought he'd finally lost it. I'm talking about literal rocks, not gems, not crystals, just regular gray and brown rocks he'd apparently collected from his backyard. They came in a crumpled paper bag with happy birthday, Becca written in his shaky handwriting. My parents looked mortified. My little brother Jake started laughing until mom elbowed him, thanks, Grandpa. I and trying not to sound disappointed. I mean, my friends got cars and iPhones for their birthdays. I got geological samples. Grandpa just winked and said, you'll figure it out, kiddo. For weeks, that bag sat on my desk, mocking me. I'd moved out most of my childhood stuff to make room for more mature decorations, but somehow those rocks stayed. Every time I looked at them, I wondered if Grandpa was developing dementia or if this was some weird test. Then one night, I was stressed about this massive history project that was due the next day. I procrastinated until the last minute, and I was panicking about how I was going to research the entire Civil War in one night. I grabbed one of grandpa's rocks without thinking and started fidgeting with it while I read. Something felt different about it. There were tiny ridges I hadn't noticed before. I held it up to my desk lamp and almost dropped it. There were letters carved Into the surface, tiny, barely visible letters that spelled look closer. My heart started racing. I dumped the entire bag onto my bed and examined each rock under my lamp. Every single one had something carved into it. Some had single letters, others had numbers, and a few had tiny symbols that looked like arrows. It took me three hours to figure out it was a puzzle. Numbers corresponded to letters in the alphabet, and the arrows showed the order. When I finally decoded everything, I had an address I didn't recognize and the words your real birthday present. The address LED me to a storage unit across town. Grandpa was waiting there the next Saturday with the key and the biggest grin I'd ever seen on his face. Inside

I was just trying to be a good uncle, but apparently that's how you end up in handcuffs. My sister Maria called me that Tuesday morning while I was still in bed after working a night shift at the hospital. Her voice sounded panicked and she was talking so fast I could barely understand her. She had some emergency medical procedure and needed me to pick up her daughter Emma from school. I hadn't seen my niece in, like, six months because I lived across town and work had been crazy. Maria texted me the details before her phone died. Emma Johnson, Missus Patterson's class. Purple backpack. I dragged myself out of bed and drove to the elementary school at dismissal time. The place was absolute chaos, with hundreds of kids in those navy blue uniforms running everywhere. I walked into the office trying to look confident, even though I felt like I was about to pass out from exhaustion. I'm here to pick up Emma Johnson, told the secretary, who was juggling three phone calls and barely looked up at me. She typed something into her computer and buzzed a classroom. A few minutes later, this little blonde girl with a purple backpack walked into the office. She seemed kind of shy, but followed me when I said her mom sent me to get her. The car ride was pretty quiet at first. My niece gave me these short answers. When I tried to make conversation, so I figured she was just tired. After school, I remembered Maria saying something about promising Emma ice cream if she was good, so I stopped at McDonald's. My niece perked up immediately and started chatting about her art project while eating her cone. We got to Maria's house, and I used the spare key under the fake rock to let us in. The house was empty since Maria was still at the hospital. I made my niece a snack and helped her with her math homework. It was actually pretty sweet when she warmed up to me. We worked on multiplication tables for a while, and then she wanted to show me her drawings. Three hours passed and everything seemed fine until my niece looked at me with these confused eyes and said, when are we going to my house? My stomach dropped. This is your house, sweetie. She shook her head. No, it's not. I live on a different street with the big tree in front. That's when everything went sideways. I tried calling Maria, but her phone was still dead. The kids started crying. I was trying to calm her down when I heard cars screeching outside. I looked through the window and saw police cars everywhere with officers pointing weapons at the house. Come out with your hands up! Someone shouted through a megaphone. The little girl ran to the door, screaming, she took me! She took me! The officers rushed In and threw me on the ground, my face pressed against Maria's carpet, while they cuffed my hands behind my back. The neighbors were all outside watching from their porches. I tried explaining, but the cops kept telling me to save it for the detectives. The interrogation room at the police station smelled like old coffee and despair. Two detectives grilled me for hours while I sat there in those metal handcuffs. They asking why I took the child and where I was planning to go. I told them over and over about Maria's call and the school pickup, but they weren't buying it. The detective with the mustache rolled his eyes and called the school, but of course, the office was closed. The principal wasn't answering her phone, and the secretary had gone home for the day. They showing me security footage of me taking Ann Emma Johnson, but there was no way to tell which one until morning.

I never thought I would. Until I discovered what my son was doing to pay for his little sister's cancer treatment. Emma was only 6 when she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The bills were crushing us. $15,000 a month, even with insurance. I worked three jobs. Warehouse, gas station, weekend construction. My wife cleaned offices after her grocery store shift. We were drowning. My 16 year old son, Jake had always been responsible. Honor roll, varsity baseball, never any trouble. But after Emma's diagnosis, he started acting strange. He came home with expensive gifts for Emma. American Girl dolls, Nintendo games, bags of her favorite organic gummy bears. When I asked where he got the money, he mumbled something about odd jobs for neighbors. Mowing lawns, walking dogs. I wanted to believe him. We needed any help we could get. The gifts kept coming. A two hundred dollar tablet so Emma could watch movies during chemo. Designer pajamas to replace the gown she hated. A stuffed elephant that cost more than groceries. I got suspicious. But Emma smile when she got those gifts. That was her only light. Then her treatment got worse. Standard chemo wasn't working. Her doctor recommended an experimental drug. $50,000 up front. Insurance wouldn't cover it. I spent three days calling every charity, foundation, begging for help. Nothing. At 2:00am, I sat at the kitchen table, calculator in hand, figuring out if we could get a second Mortgage. When Jake walked in, his eyes were red. He handed me a vanilla envelope for Emma's treatment. I opened it. Stacks of cash, all of it. $50,000. Where the hell did you get this? I demanded. He wouldn't meet my eyes. Does it matter? Emma needs it. It matters to me, Jake. Where did this money come from? He stood there, tears falling. I can't tell you. The next day, I followed him. Called in sick. Watched as he walked past the buses and student lot. A black Mercedes pulled up. The driver looked 40 in a tailored suit. Jake got in. I froze. Three hours later, the same card

A few months ago, I got added to a group chat called Wedding Squad. I assumed it was for my cousin's wedding. The names looked familiar. There was a Jess, a Tori, even a Mike. All names I vaguely recognized from family stuff, so I stayed. At first it was just casual dress choices, travel plans, someone asking if they should bring deviled eggs. I liked the vibe. No drama, lots of memes. I even I'm in once with we're not doing a bouquet toss, right? Because last time I caught it and tore my ACL. Everyone laughed. Just even replied, classic you. Cool. I was fitting in. Weeks go by and I'm deep in this wedding. Now I'm voting on flower arrangements, helping plan the Bachelorette weekend, and arguing that Mike should not wear Crocs with his suit. Then one day, someone finally asks, wait, who's this number? Silence, panicked, and said, it's me. You know, from the cabin. Jess asked, wait, are you Laura's cousin? I replied, no. Should I be? Turns out I was never supposed to be in the group. Whole different family, whole different wedding. They'd meant to add a different band, but here's the kicker. They invited me anyway. I showed up, sat between two uncles I'd never met, danced with Aunt Marcy, even gave a toast. No one questioned it. Laura hugged me at the end and said, band number two, you're One of us now. Still in the group chat. By the way. We're planning a baby shower now.

In my family, we did what we called Passing Day every year on June 11th. It wasn't like a normal Celebration with cake and presents. We'd wake up at 3:00am exactly. My dad would play this really specific song from the 70s about surviving, and we'd all gather in the living room wearing white. Mom would lay out this old Polaroid of my Uncle Roland, who died before I was born, and we'd all have to touch it. My dad would make us all drink this nasty smoothie thing that was, like tomato juice and raw eggs and some other stuff I never knew. He said it was life force, but it made me gag every time. The rule was you couldn't stop drinking until the song ended. The weirdest part was we couldn't talk about passing day to anyone outside our house. Not even my grandparents knew we did this. I found out in middle school that normal families just have, like, regular birthdays and anniversaries. I guess the worst part was the isolation room. After the smoothie thing, we'd each have to spend exactly one hour alone in a dark closet. Dad called it the void and said it was to help us understand what Uncle Rowland went through. As a kid, I was terrified of the dark and would sob the entire time. But dad said that was part of it, that I needed to feel the Fear to appreciate being alive. When I got older, I started asking questions, like why we celebrated someone dying in such a weird way. Mom would get all quiet and dad would get super intense, saying I didn't understand what a gift it was to be here. I remember him grabbing my shoulders once when I was 15, and I was, like, crying because I wanted to sleep over at Miranda's house on passing day. He looked at me with these wild eyes and said passing day was the only reason I existed. I think that was when I started to realise something was off. Miranda's family just had normal traditions, like Christmas and Thanksgiving. They didn't make her drink disgusting smoothies or lock her in closets or wake up at weird times. They didn't have pictures of dead relatives they had to touch. I spent years being so confused about it all. Sometimes I try to ask about Uncle Rowland, like how he died or why we did all this stuff. Mom would just say he passed over, which told me nothing. Dad would get this distant look and say, Rowland sacrificed everything for our family. It was all so dramatic and vague. When I turned 18, I refused to do passing day. Dad went ballistic, like, full on screaming that I was ungrateful and didn't deserve what Rowland had given us. Mom just cried in the corner, which made me feel like shit, but I couldn't do it. Anymore, I stood my ground, and dad actually locked me out of the house. I had to stay with Miranda that night. The next day, mom called me crying, saying I needed to come home. When I got there, dad was acting like nothing happened. It was so messed up. He just casually asked if I wanted breakfast, like he hadn't kicked me out the night before. After that, I moved out as fast as I could, got an apartment with Kayla, and tried to put some distance between me and my family's weirdness. I'd still visit sometimes, but I made sure it was never around June 11th. The thing is, I still couldn't stop thinking about Uncle Rowland and what really happened. Why did we have this bizarre ritual around his death? Why was my dad so obsessed with it? Why couldn't we talk about it last year? I finally got the courage to ask my grandma about him. We were having coffee, and I just casually mentioned Roland's name. She got this confused look and was like, who? Which blew my mind, because this was supposedly her son who died. I tried to explain about Dad's brother Roland, who passed away before I was born. Grandma looked seriously concerned and told me my dad was an only child. I never heard of any Roland in the family. I felt like I was going crazy. I went home and dug through old family albums looking for that Polaroid we used. During passing day, I couldn't find it anywhere. I was seriously starting to think I'd imagine the whole thing. Maybe passing day was some elaborate game my dad made up. But why would he invent a fake dead brother? A few weeks later, I found this old box hidden behind some insulation. Inside was the Polaroid of Uncle Roland. But it wasn't a picture of a man. It was a picture of a little boy, maybe 7 or 8 years old. And written on the back was Cody, age 8. Summer Camp, 1985. Cody is my dad's name. There were other things in the box, too. I didn't have time to read it all, but I took some pictures with my phone when my parents weren't looking. That night, I read through what I captured. The journal was my dad's from when he was a kid. Apparently, he had a near drowning experience at camp when he was 8. He was underwater for over four minutes and was technically dead before they resuscitated him. The time of the incident, 3:00am.

Nickname seems sweet as a kid, but hit different when you got older. So growing up, everyone in my family called me mittens. My mom, dad, both brothers, even my grandma. It was constant, mittens, come eat, mittens, clean your room. Where's mittens? I just assumed it was a quirky little pet name. I mean, I liked cats. I had tiny hands as a kid, so I figured it was something sweet about that. I even had a onesie with cat mittens sewn on it that I wore into elementary school. My lunch box said mittens. I had no reason to question it. It was just me. The nickname stuck all through childhood and into my teens. Teachers at parent night would call me mittens because that's what my parents wrote on my lunch containers. Didn't mind. I thought it was unique. At sleepovers, my friends would tease me about it, but I just shrugged it off. It's just what my family calls me. But deep down, I always kind of wondered why. There was no origin story, no cute moment that kicked it off. Just always been. I remember one day in seventh grade, my older brother brought a friend over, and the friend heard my mom call out, mittens, dinner! He paused and asked my brother, why do you call her that? My brother just grinned and said, it's a long story. Then they both started laughing. I was like, what? What's funny? But they waved me Off? Nothing. It's just a cute name. I dropped it, but it stuck in my head for years. Fast forward to high school. I'm a sophomore, and we're doing this icebreaker activity in Spanish class where we have to share our childhood nicknames and what they meant. I proudly told the class that mine was mittens and that it was because I had little hands and liked cats. That's when this kid, Tyler in the back, snorted and whispered something to the guy next to him. The teacher didn't hear, but I did. Bet she doesn't know what that really means. It bothered me all day. I went home and googled it. Nothing came up except, well, actual mittens. Still, it stirred something in me. I started casually asking family members about the nickname. Everyone deflected. My mom said, you were just such a cozy baby. And my grandma said, your hands were so warm. But my brothers would exchange these smug looks and crack up when I brought it up. Then two Christmases ago, I finally found out. I was 24 and home for the holidays. We were doing our usual gift exchange, and I got a big box from my dad. Inside a

We need to talk. Let me guess, you're taking it well. I've actually been thinking and I think I'm gonna stay here with you. What? Kylie, are you serious? Yes, baby. But this is such a big opportunity for you. Once in a lifetime, matter of a fact. I feel bad for you even thinking of declining it. I know, baby, but I value you and I more than anything. I can't imagine my life without you. OMG, that is so sweet. When do you have to tell them? Well, I just wanted to see your reaction. I already did. You declined it? Yes, baby. You declined a full ride scholarship to Stanford University to stay here with me? Yes. And I would do it all again if I could. OMG, how can I ever repay you for something like this? You being mine is more than enough. I wanna spend the rest of my life with you. And I will do anything in my power to make sure that happens. Well, I got through the easy part. Now comes the hard part. What's that? Telling my parents. You haven't told them yet? Nope. I'll talk to you in a bit. If you don't hear from me, you know why. Ha, ha. OMG, don't say that. Good luck, baby. I love you. Well, that went worse than expected. What happened? My dad flipped out telling me I need to find a job right away and that he will Never help me with anything again. My mom was a little more supportive, but still wasn't what she wanted to hear. Omg, I'm sorry baby. That sucks to hear. I know. Don't worry. Anyways, do you wanna hang out tonight? Uh, tonight? Yeah. I'm sorry baby. I thought you were going to be busy. I made plans already. Oh, no worries. I'll just stay in and watch the movies then. Frizz app, help me keep her hopes up. Tomorrow we'll spend the whole day together, my love. Tomorrow we'll spend the whole day together, my love. Yay! I can't wait to see you. It's been a little while now. I know, baby. Anyways, I'm about to leave, so I'll talk to you later. Okay. Have fun. Babe. Whose house are you at? I've never seen you go there before. Oh baby, it's just one of Adam's friends. He's got a pool so we decided to go to his house. Oh, okay. What time do you think you are going to be home? There's a new episode of Love Island we can watch over Facetime. Not for a while, baby. You'll probably be sleeping by then. I promise you I'll make up for it tomorrow. Alright, I'll say good night then. I hope you have fun. Thanks.

I do not care if it's not her birthday. She's gonna blow out those candles. So the other day, they cut a birthday cake for my niece, and while they were singing happy birthday, my daughter was screaming and crying because she wanted to blow out the birthday candles. And I told my sister, just let my daughter blow out the candles. It's not that big of a deal. She's like, it's not her birthday. I'm like, it doesn't fucking matter. Who cares? It's just candles. My sister kept on telling me no. So you know what I did? I was the one that blew out the candles on that birthday cake. I'm sorry. But I told her, you need to teach your daughter that sharing is caring. It's just candles. It's not the end of the fucking world. And then after that, my daughter wanted to open birthday presents, and she's like, no, we're gonna open them when everybody leaves. And I'm like, why? So I told my daughter, go open up the birthday gifts, and if you find a toy that you like, you're gonna take it home with you. My niece started screaming and crying. She's like, it's my birthday! It's my birthday! I'm like, oh, well, toughen up, little girl. And now my sister saying that I'm not allowed to Go back to any more birthdays and I'm like, you know what? That's fine. Nobody wanted to go to your shitty ass birthday parties. Either way, not letting a 2 year old blow out candles because it's not her birthday is fucking ridiculous.

What happened? I taught my cousins a language that changed our lives forever. You see, my family had this rule about women and silence. A woman's voice was considered poison. After her 16th birthday, the silence ceremony happened at midnight. Your father holds you down while your mother sews a red thread across your lips. Not literally, but you wore that thread on your wrist as a reminder. Break the rule once, they'll lock you in the laundry room without food. Break it twice, they'll pull a tooth. Nobody broke it three times. Women's silence was like a currency. Whichever man had the quietest house was the most praised in society. At family gatherings, my uncles would compete like kids showing off baseball cards. Mira hasn't made a sound since January, Uncle Dev would boast, spreading his fingers in response. Uncle Raj would lean back, smirking. That's nothing. Priya is going on two years. When the doctor asked her a question at her check up, she just pointed at me to answer. It actually sounds crazy saying it out loud, but for so long, this is just the way things were. And I myself was the loudest person I knew. I couldn't even get through a conversation without laughing at something the other person said, even if it wasn't meant to be funny. I loved singing lyrics out loud and making weird sounds with my friends. So I knew if I didn't Find an answer soon, then my life would be over. But I wanted the problem to go away by itself. And one day, it did. I was sitting in seventh grade when Miss Brown told us that we needed to take a foreign language. My ears perked up because ASL, American Sign Language, counted. You see, the whole time, me and my family were in the USA. Because it wasn't until you turned 16 and made the vow of silence before you were sent back to the motherland. And there you were forced to settle down and have kids. So three times a week, I sat in Misser Brown's classroom learning to speak with my hands. Adrenaline pumped through my veins. If she so much as texted my parents about my choice of language, they'd find out what I was up to, and my life would be over. I even didn't know what I was going to do with the lessons because no one around me spoke the language. But then came Diwali dinner. All our relatives flew in from in the motherland to eat at our house. It was supposed to be the happiest time of the year. But during the meal, I noticed Priya sitting by herself at the end of the table. There were tears silently streaming down her face, and she was unable to tell anyone why. She was 17. A year into her silence, when no one was looking, I handed her a glass of Water. With a note in my hand. Meet me by the garden shed. Bring your sister. I told everyone that I noticed her sorry was wrinkled and I was going to teach her how to fold it properly in the shed. That's how it started. Every family gathering. While the men watched cricket and the silenced women served food, me and the younger girls would cluster together, all desperate to avoid our fate. I taught them letters first, then words. Then we had whole conversations flowing between our fingers. We got creative with practice locations, signing while washing dishes, our hands hidden in soapy water. We developed our own secret gesture. A flick of the wrist meant he's coming. A thumb brush meant save this conversation for later. By the time I turned 15, we had a full network. 12 girls between the ages of 9 and 15, all fluent in a language, are fathers and brother

Now my brother's wife is questioning their role with her baby. My brother and I grew up in the same house with the same parents, but somehow we ended up with very different memories of our childhood. Because of that, I avoid discussing our upbringing, especially with people outside the family. When my brother's wife or someone from her family asks about how we were raised, I always steer clear. I'll say something like, you'll have to ask my brother about that. Do this. Because if I say anything that goes against my brother's version of events, it could lead to a major argument. So I stay neutral and let him take the lead. Most of the time, our childhood doesn't even come up, so it's not a big deal. A few months ago, we were having dinner with my parents, my brother, his wife, and her sister. At one point, my mother asked my brother sister in law if she wanted children. She said she did someday. My mother loved that answer and made a pointed comment about how happy she was to hear something normal for once. Unlike having a daughter like me who doesn't want kids. She's always been obsessed with that detail about me, so I wasn't surprised. But this time, she really went off. She even faked tears, acting devastated that I never wanted children without really thinking. I finally snapped and Said even if I had kids, you'd never meet them. So I don't know why you're so upset. I have my reasons for saying that, but my parents and even my brother have always denied anything bad ever happened in our childhood. Now, my brother's wife is seven months pregnant with their first baby, and she was understandably shaken by what I said. She asked me to explain why I wouldn't allow our parents around my hypothetical children, but again, I didn't want to go into detail. My memories of our childhood are different from my brothers and our parents, and if I spoke honestly, they'd just call me a liar. So I told her to ask my brother instead. To my surprise, she did. Later on, she brought it up with him. He told her our mother never liked rarely, for whatever reason, but our kids will probably be fine. She didn't find that very comforting, so she pushed for more answers. Eventually, he started telling her things. At the time, he fell into a public pool. I jumped in to save him, and our mother screamed at me for pushing him in, then gave me the silent treatment for days. He told her how our mother used to take his socks, put them in my room, then accused me of stealing them. He remembered how I had to eat my meals at a separate table because our mother wanted one on one time with him. He told her How I was always in trouble at home, even though I was never a problem at school. When his wife asked me if all that was true, I said yes, but I also reminded her that my

When my grandmother was checked into the nursing home, my parents seemingly erased her from the family. They dropped her off, blocked her number, and never looked back. I barely even thought about it because of how normal they made it seem. We're always saying stuff like, she's better off there or we're too busy for her. I remember being 17 when my mom made me drop off some insurance papers at the nursing home. I was walking through the halls when I saw this big calendar hanging in the common room. They had all the residents birthdays listed, and I saw my grandmother's name circled for three weeks time. I figured, oh, cool. They must have a little party planned or something. I asked one of the nurses about it, just trying to make small talk. She gave me this confused look. She said no one had come to visit my grandma in nearly eight months. That hit me like a punch in the chest. I walked to her room feeling kind of sick. When I got there, grandma was just sitting in her wheelchair by the window, staring outside. I almost didn't recognize her at first. Her hair looked thinner, and all around her were old family photos, but every single one was face down. She turned when she heard me, and for a second, her whole face lit up. Then just as fast, it shut down, like a door slamming. She mumbled a hello and turned her chair back toward the window like she didn't want to get her hopes up. I asked her if she knew her birthday was coming up, and she just shrugged like she didn't care. But I could tell she cared. On the drive home, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I felt furious at my parents. I felt guilty, too, because I had just gone along with it. That night, I decided I was going to throw her a birthday party. I didn't tell anyone, but I started picking up extra shifts at the cafe where I worked after school. I dipped into my college savings, even though I knew my parents would flip if they found out. Every time they asked why I was never home, I just said I had group projects or extra credit. The nursing home wasn't exactly thrilled when I asked about hosting a party.

And people do not understand. They're like, oh, consumption bar. That means they're only gonna charge me for the drinks that are drink at my wedding, and I'm sure my guests aren't gonna drink that much. So it's definitely gonna be cheaper. Where with an open bar, they're gonna charge you a blank rate per guest, regardless of how many drinks they drink, but they get unlimited drinks. The reason why open bar pricing is safer than consumption is because people at a wedding drink a lot, way more than they usually do. And I'm gonna show you with an example and a breakdown of what it could look like. Because let's be honest, when you aren't footing the Bill, you don't care if you set your drink down and it gets cleared. It's a Celebration. You're drinking more, you're gonna try new drinks. Don't like it, you put it in the trash. And caterers literally clear table so much to keep it looking nice, neat, and clean. So, yeah, you go through way more drinks. Here's an example. First, let's look at open bar pricing. Let's say it's $30 for an open bar for your guests. You have 100 guests. It's gonna be $3,000 for your open bar. Unlimited drinks for every single guest. Now, let's say you go with a consumption bar. On average, At a wedding, a guest will drink seven drinks. Three drinks for cocktail hour. This would be two drinks plus a buffer drink. And then one drink per hour for the rest of the night. Six hours. That's seven drinks per guest. At the end of the night, they said 2 hundred people had wine. And that's six dollars a glass. That's twelve hundred dollars. Three hundred people had beer or seltzers. That's four dollars each. That's 12 dollars. And 200 people had alcoholic beverages. With liquor, those are nine dollars each. These are made up prices. That comes out to 40. 2 hundred dollars more than an open bar. So think about it, people. You cannot control how many drinks your guests are gonna drink.

You know that one guy at every party? The one who thinks he's God's gift to alcohol and women? The guy who says things like, I mix better than I date, and if you can't handle a little fun, go home? Yeah, that guy. For me, that guy had a name. Mason. Mason was the kind of guy who wore sunglasses indoors and took shirtless mirror pics like it was a civic duty. He thought spiking people's drinks was hilarious. Just a little joke, bro. He like slipping something into someone's drink was on par with drawing a mustache on a passed out friend. Spoiler alert it's not. I found out the hard way. It was during our friend Bailey's New Year's party. Good people, decent music, enough food to soak up the bad decisions. I grabbed a drink off the kitchen island. Non alcoholic cause I was the designated driver. Took a few sips. It tasted a little weird. Like if regret had a flavor. I figured maybe the soda was flat. Ten minutes later, the room started spinning like it was trying to detach from earth. I barely made it to the bathroom before my legs went full jello. My heart was racing in crawling, and I was suddenly having a deep personal conversation with the floor tiles. Bailey found me an hour later, curled up like a shrimp in her tub. She called an Ambulance. Thank god. Turns out Mason had decided to spice up the party by adding something to my drink. Something prescription based. Something not meant for conscious humans. He thought it was funny. Dude, you should have seen your face, he said, laughing when I confronted him. Relax. I gave you the light stuff. Ah, yes, just a sprinkle of involuntary coma. How festive. I wanted to punch him, but I'm not stupid. People forget bruises, but they don't forget fear. Especially the kind that seeps in drop by drop. So I made a decision. Mason was going to become terrified of liquids. All of them. The plan took finesse. I couldn't just scream revenge and run at him with a water balloon. This had to feel like karma was slowly dripping down his neck. And it started with coffee. I knew Mason's routine. Every morning, same cafe, same order. Iced triple espresso with oat milk. Two pumps of ego. So I applied for a job at that cafe. Not because I needed it, but because revenge requires commitment. After three weeks of being the overly eager new guy, I got barista duty. And when Mason walked in, I greeted him with my best you probably don't remember drugging me smile. He didn't recognize me. Perfect. I made his drink. Nothing in it yet, but after handing it to him, I leaned over and said, we've had a few complaints about mold in the oatmeal. Let us

What made you realise it wasn't the life for you? I was 18 when I met Mary Soul. During that time, I was a gang leader with the Latin Kings. Mary Soul was a church girl. My grandmother dragged me to Sunday Mass and when I saw her, to me, it was love at first sight. I asked my cousin, who was a friend of hers, if he could introduce us, but he refused. He didn't want me to mess with her. He didn't want me to ruin her. I had never met someone that I wanted to make myself better, to be with. That was her. When I found out that she was going to church almost every day, I hung out by the steps talking to her. I always walked her to and from church. She made me feel like there was more to the Latin Kings. One thing LED to another and we ended up going on a date. I felt great. For a year, I pushed myself away from the gang life, got my GED, became a regular church goer and was thinking about the future when I got unintentionally pulled back in. I was at a store and ran into someone that I used to have problems with. They were running their mouths and I tried to ignore it. I swear I did. I just let them talk and I walked away. But then I got stabbed in the shoulder blade. The Pain hadn't hit yet, and I lost my mind. I beat the hell out of them. I got arrested, and suddenly it was like the crap I did to make my life better vanished. Mary Soul was pissed at me. My grandmother kept bringing up my past mistakes, and my cousin was telling me that he knew that I wasn't going to change. My public defender saw me trying to better myself, and by the Grace of god, got me off after a month in lock up. Despite being angry with me, Mary Sol did visit me almost daily. A month after I got out, I found out I was going to be a father. And I didn't want my kid to have a dad that was dead or in jail. We eloped. I went to a trade school to become a mechanic, and I busted my butt for my future family. When Luna was born, it was almost the worst day of my life. Mary's soul wouldn't stop bleeding. She went into shock and they had to give her a double hysterectomy. She was in the hospital for months, and Luna became my world. I wanted her life to be the best. I wanted to give her the world. When Mary's soul was released, I promised her that our daughter will have a life far better than ours. And for years, I kept that promise. I saved enough money to move us to the suburbs, became homeowners. I was A Girl Scout leader, if you could believe that. I made sure Luna went to private school, made sure she knew how to defend herself, and always made sure I was the perfect husband. I didn't know my parents didn't have a positive male role model in my life, so I didn't know what a healthy relationship looked like. That's a lie. TV dads were my male role models, and I mimic them in the marriage they had on TV. As the years went by, I owned my own garage. My cousin became a pastor, but still. My grandmother was still a pain in my ass. My relationship with my wife was stronger than ever. I made sure I kept my prison body. Luna hated me. She didn't want me to hug her. She rolled her eyes every time I told her I loved her, ignored me when I asked her about her day in school. It hurt me far beyond words. For two years, it was like that. So for her quinceanera, I wanted to go all out. I got everything she wanted, and she was still disrespectful. And briefly, the old me almost came out just to put her in her place. But instead, I went to my cousin, vented my frustration and doubts about being a good father. And he told me to just let her be. And he said a prayer for me. I wanted a slideshow for the father daughter dance. I got a chunk Of the pictures of us together. But I realised something. I didn't have any recent pictures of us. She didn't want to take any. The last time I had pictures of her and I smiling with me was on her 13th birthday. And those were on my daughter's broken tablet. I took that tablet, went to a repair shop and asked for it to be fixed. I didn't care about the cost. I needed that tablet fixed. After a day and $300, the tech fixed it, and I was happy. I knew her passcode, but I never bothered invading her privacy. I just wanted those pictures. And when I opened the tablet and looked in the gallery, they were there. My little girl, smiling and happy to be with me. I felt great. Then the instant messages appeared. It was my daughter talking to my wife. It was a long banter. That she didn't want me to dance with her. And it did hurt. But like my wife said, she's being a teenager. Then she said something that destroyed me. She texted, why do I have to do the father daughter dance with him? He's not even my dad. I felt my heart stop. My wife responded that I raised her, I loved her, and that makes me her father. But Luna responded by saying that my cousin is her father, and she can't wait for her to turn 18, so she could tell me the truth. And she could Live with her real dad. She said she hated me. She said that she thanked god that I'm not her father. Mary's soul began cursing her out. She said it was a mistake for my cousin to tell her the truth two years ago. And the more they talked, the angrier I got. My wife lied to me for 15 years. My cousin, whom I confide my issues about Luna and my fears about being a bad father, not only slept with my wife, but had me raise his child.

Women might dislike the lack of physical affection and emotional support men often experience from friends. 2. Magically, no one cares about your feelings. 3. The amount of effort it takes to not be perceived as creep or perv, or the lack of benefit of the doubt. One example happened just the other day at the train station. Sat by myself, no one else here yet. As I'm early and it's a quiet station, I'm watching crap on my phone with my prescription sunglasses on. Excuse me, what do you think you're doing? I look up and some woman has stood staring at me. Huh? What? I'm confused as I've been pulled out of my little world. Why are you staring? And were you taking photos? I want to see your phone. I look around and in front of me were three very young teens in thong bikinis, squatting down, waiting for the train. And I realize what the woman must have been thinking. I'm autistic and struggle with public confrontation at the best of times. All my rights to privacy go out the window now. If I argue, she will call the police. If I walk away, I look guilty. As the station is filling up, more people are now staring at me and this woman shouting at me. I have to show her my recent photos, and she accuses me of using another app, the Train then pulls up and I tell her to piss off and she starts screaming pedo. I had to get off that train and wait for the next as she was following me shouting perv and pedo. I was lucky I didn't get my head kicked in thanks to her. Can you imagine what it feels like to have 50 odd people giving you disgusted and threatening looks thanks to a shit set of circumstance?

One. I had a girlfriend once who thought that purposefully missing her flights was cute and funny. She would ask me to take her to the airport, but whenever I got to her apartment, she was either sleeping or not even packed yet because she claimed she forgot about the flight. After the third time she did this, she said it was because she thought it made her look adorable being so forgetful. 2. Stop stealing my fucking clothes. I go to get a shirt. Oh wait, no, it's not there. Why? Because you like to sleep in it? Because it makes you think of me. Dude, you've got like, 12 of my shirts. Are you building a nest? Three. Indirectly asking for things. For example, saying, I'm so thirsty instead of can you get me a glass of water? Four. Taking hats. It's mad obnoxious and most of the time done in a very rough manner, like, you just robbed my hat, bitch! And the whole reason I'm wearing one is cause my hair looks like shit today. You wouldn't like it if I ripped out your scrunchie or some shit? 5. Stop taking our goddamn food off our plate. 6. No means no. You jokingly asked if I wanted to try makeup on at the mall on our first date. I said no. You asked six more times. If I wasn't your ride home, I would have just walked away. 7. Treating a gay guy like he's your object. I've broken friendships with women over this because they treated me like I was their accessory. 8. Acting stupid. Like truly stupid. 9. Hitting us when we say something you disapprove of. 10. Order a fucking salad at dinner, then giggle as she picks at your meal. 11. Crazy is not cute. Stop trying to be Harley Quinn. 12. Baby voice. I hate it. Just use your normal voice when talking to me. None of this stupid higher pitch tone. 13. Tickling. One girl I was with would not fucking stop for 25 minutes. I told her to cut it out. I was tickle grapped.

You took 200 dollar bills. People don't even have that kind of money. And you soaked it in wine. Hello? May I speak to Alyssa, please? Yeah, I'm Alyssa. Hey, Alyssa, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. The radio station? Yeah, the entire radio station. Well, I mean, why are you calling me? I just want to talk. Yeah, she said. Honestly, I just. I need somebody to talk to. And I figured I would dial a random phone number, hoping that Alyssa would answer. And it all worked out. Sometimes life is crazy like that. Alyssa, what's the real reason you're calling me? Well, because I got an email about you. It's from a guy named Kyle that you went on a date with. What? Yeah, you went out with a guy named Kyle a little while ago, right? Unfortunately, I did. So obviously you didn't enjoy your date with Kyle very much. Um, no. Well, Kyle enjoyed his date with you and he liked you a lot. And that's why he emailed us, because he wanted us to see if we could get you on the phone since you haven't been responding to any of his text messages or phone calls or anything like that. Oh, really? So do you think you could tell us why you're not wanting to go out with Kyle again? I don't know that I wanna broadcast it. I mean. Well, You don't have to broadcast it. We will. I know what you mean. I just don't want to really say it on the radio. He told us about your date, and I would think from his recap that it would make him look bad. Yeah, okay, but you probably already know the reason why. I mean, he's told you about the date. I'm guessing it's from his ex girlfriend texting him throughout the date. Haha. He told you about that? Yeah, he told. He told us about that. And he told us about how he spilt some wine after too. And how he handled the ex thing. Like showing you the text messages. I know. And I'm on the first date with this guy. What are you doing? Yeah, yeah. Pretty boneheaded move. Totally. For sure. So that was it then? We should tell him never to show a date the crazy text from your ex girlfriend that you're getting. Well, yeah, that was definitely good advice, cause that. That wasn't good at all. Right, but you know, I have a crazy ex, so I get it. So I like, you know, we talked about it and I was like, okay, gotta let him off the hook a little. So, you know, maybe he's nervous. Whatever. So wait, you're saying that you moved past that and you were okay with it? I mean, I wasn't okay with it, but I was. I was willing to like, really give him a Chance, you know what I mean? Alright then. So then what ruined it? The wine. He blew it again, spilling the wine. And you just had it. You're like, dude, that was a good glass of wine. You idiot! That's a party foul. As a dating foul. No, it was really the conversation. Meeting up with that. Like he was very proud of his accomplishments and just talking about how much money he has. Like. Oh god. I mean to the extent like it's like, oh, two weeks ago I rented a Lear jet or something. It was like a private jet or something. What? Yeah, for his boys. And then they flew to Vegas and then they're like pop and bottle. Wow. So jealous. I know. I'm actually really jealous of him right now. Both. Both Jose and Jubal want to date him suddenly. Yeah. I don't get why men think that women are only interested in money. I think it's cause he was overcompensating because of the whole ex texting him and he thought that bothered me. Oh, so he's trying to impress you after messing up, right? Yeah. And it obviously didn't work. No. And that's when the whole wine situation happened. And then I couldn't believe what he did. What did he do? So he knocks over the glass of wine, it goes all over the table. Uh huh. And I'm thinking, oh gosh, we gotta get the waiter for. For napkins. So I'm looking for Napkins, as I look up, I see him reached his back pocket and he has these like two 100 dollar bills. And he's dabbing up the wine with money. No, shut up, way

Yeah, can I speak to Thomas, please? This is him. Who's this? Thomas? What's up, man? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Um, who's, who's that? Uh, Brooke and Jubal in the morning. It's a radio show. Uh, okay. Um, you ever listen to us before? No, I don't. I don't do mornings. Really? I don't blame you. I am so jealous of that. You are a good person. Yeah, seriously, you gotta figure it out. I'm so tired of waking up this early. Um, well, did I, like, win something? What's going on? No, you didn't. We do a segment on our show. It's called the Second Date Update. That's where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up not calling them back after, they can email us to see if we can get you on the phone and find out what happened. So somebody emailed us about you. Oh, that sounds like a lot of work. It is a lot to get a hold of somebody, but it's usually because they really liked the person. Any idea who would have emailed us? I don't know, dude. Um, are you awake right now, Thomas? I mean, I don't wanna be, but I am now. Yeah. Okay. Sorry, man. I'll show you, man. I, I, I'm right there with you. Is this gonna take, like, how long is this gonna take? It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. In Case you're busy or whatever, but I just wanna go back to sleep. Well, do you remember going out with a girl named Kelsey? Probably. Probably. Oh, my god. Do you remember her or no? Yeah. Yeah, I remember. Okay. What's up? Well, Kelsey emailed us because she told us about your date. And she said that you guys went for a walk, stopped by the grocery store, and she invited you to the movies, and that's when you. Oh, yeah. It was a lot. It was. It was a lot. It was a lot. It was a lot. What was a lot about it? The walk or the grocery store? All of it. It was, uh. Anyway, so what's. What do. What do you need? Oh, my god. Well, Kelsey. Kelsey wants to know why you're not calling her back. Oh, gosh, Thomas, can you tell. Can you tell us why? I guess it was just, like, she wanted to do so much stuff. Really? What do you mean? She thought she was too boring for you. She thought that a walk in a grocery store was, like, lame and that you were looking for more excitement. That's why I don't. Who walks? Like, that's why they invented cars and Uber. Like, why do we have to walk? It was so much. Okay, so it's not that you were bored on the day, you just didn't want to walk? Pretty much. No, it was. I didn't want to do And then. And then after the walking goes the random restaurant, and then the grocery store. And then I have to carry her groceries. Then I have to help her put the groceries up. And then. And then after all of that, on top of that, she's like, oh, yeah, let's go see a movie. I'm like, oh my god, I just did more work than I've done all week. I don't want to do any small things. And it was so late, dude, it was like 8:00 o'clock or something. Like, it was so late. I don't. I don't like it. Wait, Thomas, you're concentrating a lot on the things that you did on the date, but what about her? Did you enjoy hanging out with her? She said she was laughing a ton. I mean, she was cool. It was just. She does too much, man. I'm not. I'm not that. I'm not an outdoorsy dude who likes to do all this. Like, I feel like she would go hiking and that sounds terrible. Haha. Okay, so if I'm. If I'm reading this correctly, you just feel like she likes to do way too much? I mean, I'm in social. Find someone who likes to do stuff with her, and that's awesome, but I just don't. I don't like. If I didn't have to leave the house, I would not leave the house. Why? Wait, why are you even dating then, Thomas? Like, dating requires you To do stuff. It doesn't, though. Like, you can say you dating, you drive to a place, you eat dinner at a place, and then that's it. And then maybe you. And maybe. Maybe you go back and you watch like, Netflix or Hulu or something. Like, it's not. I don't know. She wanted to do so many things and I just. I'm not that kind of dude. Haha. I'm not that kind of dude. Alright, well, at least you know what you want, Thomas. Oh, you should have told her that though. Thomas. She. She did not. Yeah, but then I'd have to like, meet up again. We probably have to go on another walk to explain why I don't like going on walk. Haha. Yeah, a lot of effort. Well. Wow. Thomas, I. I know that this is probably gonna be hard for you to deal with, but Kelsey is on the other line and wants to talk to you for a minute. Oh my god, you guys are the worst! Haha.

I don't even know what you're calling about. Why do you want to know? Well, we do a segment on our show, and. It's gonna kind of be an awkward conversation here, Aaron. We do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. Uh huh. And that's where if a listener of ours goes out on a date with somebody and ends up getting blown off, we get an email from them asking if we can call that person and ask why. So somebody sent us an email about Isabella? That doesn't even make sense. How long have you. Someone. Yes. Somebody recently met Isabella and has been texting with her and thought that everything was going well, and then Isabella kind of stopped responding to him and told them not to text anymore, and they were hoping to get a second date. Um, are you in Are you in a person? We've been. We're together like. So there's no way she's going out on a date with someone else. Yeah, right. No, especially not recently. Hey, Aaron, I don't want to try to blow up her spot like this. Not might not be a bad thing. How long have you guys been together? Cause she could. It could be that you just recently met a guy or whatever. No, you know, it's not even possible. We've been together for a long time, on and off. So maybe during one of those off periods something could have happened. But even that seems unlikely. I know, I know this is probably a hard phone call to take and to hear. Not hard to hear, but it's doesn't make sense. Not even possible. Aaron, a guy emailed us and he's been texting with Isabella. They met at a party a few weeks ago, hung out, had a good time. He thought that she was into him, and then she said, don't text me anymore and stop texting him. That's why he wanted us to call. Right? But I'm on her phone now. I've checked her phone. There's no text messages from any guy. Okay, I can assure you that you check her phone all the time. Enough. We trust each other. Whatever. You know, I'm like. Trust. Two weeks ago, were you guys together or on a break? Cause you said you guys have breaks. Look, it's really none Of your fucking business at this point. It's not. You don't even want to know if maybe your girlfriend is cheating on you. Who the fuck are you? I've already answered all of your dumb questions, so I think you need to fuck off. I'm just trying to help you get to the bottom of it, because this is the phone number that we got from another dude who said that he met Isabella. Look, if you have some guy that's calling you, then why don't you tell him he's mistaken and he's got the wrong person and she's got a boyfriend and to just, like, back off and stop harassing her? Okay? I'll do that for you. Hey, Jake, back off. Isabella has a boyfriend. His name is Aaron. This is so uncomfortable. Aaron. Jake, the guy who says he met Isabella is actually on the phone with us right now. Jake, say hi to Aaron. Hey. So how long have you guys been dating? You never really answered that question. Who the fuck are you? I'm not even gonna answer this. I don't even know who you are. I don't wanna know who you are. You sound like a little bit of a dweeb. And I don't think she's ever I, I met Isabella. A deal, dude. Oh, here's the deal. We hung out for the whole night. She stayed in my bed. But it doesn't sound like you guys are really into each other. You won't even Say how long you've been dating. All right, dude, here's the deal. I don't know who the fuck you are. I don't have a problem with you, but you keep pushing down this road, we're gonna have a problem. You need to back off. I don't know. What are we going on? You've made a mistake. All right, Jake, why don't we. Why don't we just ask Isabella who she wants to be? Yeah, why don't we ask Isabella? Yeah, why don't we ask Isabella? Oh, god, this is so uncomfortable, Aaron. I mean, I know you have her phone right now, but how can we get a hold of her? I'm not gonna give you any of your info. Where is she? She must be coming back soon. This is ridiculous. I am with Isabella. We are together. No, you can't talk to her. No, we're not gonna go through. I'm not gonna listen to this pseudo shrink try to tell me that my relationship isn't working out. All right, you may maybe. Radio show. Maybe. You guys weren't together two weeks ago. It was two weeks ago, Aaron. That's when Jake says he met Isabella and she spent the night at his house. In his bed. In his bed.

How's it going? Um, hi. Who's this? I can't tell you that, but I go to your school. We've never talked, but I've had a crush on you since middle school. If you had a crush on me for so long, why have we never spoken? Because I'm scared. And I don't know if you would feel the same way. Why don't we play a game? Okay. What kind of game? You have until July to figure out who I am. Is this an excuse to get me to talk to you for the whole year? Pretty much. Why not? I do need to let you know I already have a crush on a girl in my school, so don't get your hopes up. That's fine. Let's see what happens. Hey. You looked hot today. You were watching me? It's kind of weird. Rizz app respond with how could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? How could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? Wow. That actually made me feel good. At least give me clues about yourself. Why? So I can at least get a starting point on who you are. Fine. I am blonde. That doesn't help me. There are lots of blonde girls in our school. Be more specific. I have a birthmark on my neck, so I have to go check every blonde girl's neck. So tell me about this girl. You like her? Name is Violet. She's perfect. We have never spoken. Sadly. Do you know her? Violet? Oops, sorry. I do know her. Maybe when I find out who you are, you can introduce me to her. You can ask her right now and she will say yes. How can you be so sure? I'm too scared to ask her. Don't worry. She is nice. Okay. Good night, mystery girl. I'm going to get some sleep. Good night. What? I don't get a message today. Ah. Does someone miss me? In your dreams. I was just surprised how my crush since middle school hadn't messaged me today. I have a question for you. Sure. Ask away. How could you have loved me for so long if we haven't spoken ever? You are handsome. The way you talk to people. You are such a kind soul. Polite. You make everyone laugh. You are a gentleman. I always knew you are what I always wanted. Now I really wanna know who you are. Patience. Hey. Hey. Can I admit something to you? Sure. I'm not interested in Violet anymore. Really? How come? She's beautiful. So beautiful that I was too scared to even go near her. That's the issue. She's perfect in every way. But I have fallen for someone else. Someone who I do speak to. Someone who understands me. Someone without a name or a face, but someone who loves me. The day you find out who I am, I hope we Will be together. Me too. Mystery girl.

Did you break that? Cost you everything. Every Christmas morning, my mom would wake us up at 4:00am to clean the entire house before anyone could open presents. Not just tidy up. I'm talking scrubbing baseboards with toothbrushes, bleaching grout, reorganizing every single closet. My dad would sit in his recliner with his coffee and smartphone, timing us. We took longer than three hours, Christmas was cancelled. No presents, no dinner, nothing. He'd pack everything back up and donate it to Goodwill The next day. I thought this was totally normal until I was 12 and spent Christmas Eve at my friend's house. Her family was laughing, wrapping last minute gifts, being homemade cookies. When I casually mentioned our cleaning tradition, her mom just stared at me with this horrified look. Honey, she said quietly, that's not normal. That's not how families should celebrate. That conversation changed everything. That's when I started noticing other weird things. How my siblings and I would get actual stomachaches every December starting around Thanksgiving. How my mom would pop pills like candy starting in November, hiding the bottles behind the cleaning supplies. How my dad seemed to genuinely enjoy watching us cry when we couldn't get the bathroom tiles clean enough for his inspection. Mom would take pictures of us scrubbing floors in our Christmas pajamas and post them on Facebook with captions like teaching my kids real work ethic. No free rides in this house. You get hundreds of Likes from other parents calling her a parenting genius and asking for tips. I started screenshotting those comments even at 12. Something felt so wrong about adults praising our misery. When I finally turned 16, I snapped. Christmas morning, dad started his timer like always and I just walked upstairs and crawled back into bed. Get your butt down here right now! He screamed up!

My grandpa lived on a ranch in Montana that's been in our family since the 1800s. Everything was peaceful until this big shot real estate developer from New York bought the land next to us and started building a luxury resort. The problem started when he diverted the creek that ran through both our properties to fill his man made lake. That creek watered our cattle for generations. When grandpa went over to talk about it, developer security guards wouldn't even let him through the gate. Instead, we got a letter from his lawyer saying the water rights belong to them now and we should adapt to changing times. Grandpa, who'd been a rancher his whole life, just smiled and said, well, looks like someone needs to learn about country consequences. The next day, Grandpa drove his old pickup to the local feed store and bought every single bag of cow manure they had. Three truckloads worth. He waited until the middle of the night when the wind was blowing directly toward the resort and spread it all along our side of the property line. The smell was so bad that resort started checking out early. But that was just phase one of Grandpa's plan. When the developer installed sprinklers that sprayed water onto our land to make it look greener for their guests, Grandpa built a 20 foot tall reflector wall out of old tin roofing. It bounced the sunlight directly. Into the resort's dining area, making it so hot and bright that nobody could sit out there. The developer sent more angry letters, but everything Grandpa did was perfectly legal. He was just maintaining his property. Things got serious when the developer started dumping their construction waste on our land at night. We caught it all on the trail cameras Grandpa set up. They were trespassing, but the local sheriff was getting paid off and wouldn't do anything about it. So Grandpa called his old buddies, 15 Vietnam veterans who'd served with him. They showed up with their RVs and camped along our property line, taking shifts watching the border with binoculars and CB radios. When the developer's workers came to dump more trash, they found themselves surrounded by elderly veterans with spotlights, taking pictures and recording license plate numbers. Within minutes, the workers took off. The final straw came during the resort's grand opening. They'd invited reporters and wealthy potential investors. Grandpa chose that day to move his entire cattle herd, 300 cows to graze right along the fence. On cue, his buddy Terry flew over in his crop duster plane, which spooked the herd so bad, they all started mooing and running straight toward the resort fence. The developer watched in horror from a champagne reception as hundreds of panicked cattle stampeded right past his wealthy guests, kicking up a dust cloud that covered everything. Two days later, a black SUV

Hit a spoiled brat? I worked as a waiter at this upscale restaurant during college, the kind where entrees cost more than I made in a shift. We had this regular customer, Veronica, who was about 17 and the daughter of some tech CEO. Every Friday night, she'd roll up in a car that cost more than my tuition, with a different group of friends demanding the best table without reservations. The manager always gave in because her father spent thousands there entertaining clients. Veronica had this habit of sending back perfectly good food, claiming it was inedible after taking two bites, changing her order multiple times, and making servers run back and forth for ridiculous requests, like water with exactly three ice cubes, not four. She'd leave her table looking like a tornado hit it. Makeup smeared on our cloth napkins, food deliberately spilled. And the worst part, almost never tipping despite keeping us an hour past closing. One server, Maria, got fired after Veronica complained that she looked at her wrong while serving. Maria was a single mom working three jobs to support her kids. Final straw came during graduation season. Veronica arrived with 10 friends without a reservation during our busiest night of the year. Every table was booked weeks in advance by family celebrating their graduates accomplishments. When the hostess politely explained we couldn't accommodate them, Veronica exploded, screaming that she was more important than these community any college losers. And demanding we kick someone out. She whipped out her phone, calling her father and putting him on speaker, expecting him to threaten the restaurant. I was cleaning a nearby table and watch the whole scene unfold. The hostess was nearly in tears as Veronica screamed that she'd get everyone fired. That's when a man at a nearby table stood up. He walked over, calmly, introduced himself as Daniel Morgan, and asked to speak with Veronica's father, who was still on speaker phone. Veronica smirked, thinking this random diner was about to get humiliated by her powerful dad. Hello? This is

I was lucky enough to have my daughter in my class when she reached eighth grade. But I also had a student named miles who just couldn't sit still. He constantly bugged the girls, always trying to flirt, and it usually ended with him getting slapped or sent to the office. I'd send him down so many times that the front desk basically expected him every day. Eventually, I moved him to the front of the room just so I could keep an eye on him. One day, he asked me if he could sit in the back. He didn't argue or act out. He just asked nicely. For some reason. I said, yes, we. We're in the middle of an assignment, and the entire room was quiet. That's when I heard whispering from the back. I looked up and saw miles showing something to another student. At first glance, it looked exactly like a handgun. Froze for a second. I didn't know if I was seeing it right. Maybe it was a toy or a prop. But I couldn't tell from where I was sitting. And I knew I needed to get a better look without making a scene. I got up to help a student near the back and use that chance to look again. This time, I knew for sure it wasn't fake. It was real. I felt sweat drip down my face, my hands, Were shaking while I quietly pulled out my phone under the desk and tried to call 9 1 1. But the room was too quiet. I couldn't risk saying anything. I couldn't just leave the class either. I had to keep everyone safe. And most of all, I needed to get my daughter out of there. I texted the assistant principal in all caps, telling him exactly what I had seen. Then I waited. I kept glancing at my daughter, trying to keep it together, but minutes passed and no response came. I knew I had to do something. I quietly called over one of the students I trusted and handed her a note I had written. It said, ask me to go to the bathroom. Find the assistant principal, show him this tech, tell him to check his phone and leave the building right away. She nodded and left without a word. I went back to my desk and acted like nothing was wrong. Five long minutes later, someone knocked on the door. The assistant principal walked in, calm and casual, and started chatting with a couple students near the front. Then he looked at miles. Can I talk to you outside for a minute?

I once had a pale, redheaded nine year old girl come in with her mom who was asking me to braid her daughter's hair into cornrows. At first I thought it was a joke, so I laughed and said, that's cute, but what do you actually want me to do? The mother did not take that well and said that she just told me what she wanted. Her daughter's friends all had cornrows at school, and now her daughter wanted them as well. I figured this woman may not know what cornrows were, so I asked her if she had a picture of what she was referring to. To my surprise, there was a group of about seven little girls with cornrows in their hair. I had no words. I told her that I didn't want to be rude, but I would not service her daughter because I did not feel comfortable doing that. I let her know she might have her hair start falling out and it wouldn't be comfortable or suitable. The mother looked at me with the most evil look in her eyes. She said, you will be doing my daughter's hair because I'm paying you. I looked at her again and let my tongue go when I told her that her daughter's scalp would be redder than her hair if I gave her cornrows. Well, that seemed to set her off. She cursed Me out and said I was being exclusive and a big Karen over a hairstyle. I couldn't help but laugh at how ridiculous she sounded. She grabbed her daughter and pulled her hand to walk out of my salon. My co workers and I laughed about the situation after, and she told me she would have refused to damage the poor girl's hair as well if the mother tried to ask her to do it instead of me.

A girl walked into my salon with a giant bald man behind her who demanded I buzz every hair off of her. As a hairdresser, I'm always taught to pay attention to who walks into our salon. A lot of the time, it'll be a woman with her group of friends, a woman with her kids, or a woman with her boyfriend. This man, however, looked like the king pin. He looked like he might have been the girl's father. It was odd, since most men don't go to the salon with their daughters. So at first I found it cute that a man was stepping up and taking his daughter to get her hair done. That was up until she sat in my chair with tears in her eyes. He asked me to shave everything off. I took a step back and looked at her father, who was already looking at me with a cold gaze. I asked her if she was sure, but before she could even respond, her father screamed out, hey! No questions! Everyone in the salon whipped their heads and looked at him. He didn't change his look at all. He was completely serious. My hands were shaking and I didn't know what to do, so I decided to stall by washing her hair to see what was going on. I took her to the back sinks and started rinsing her hair. I sneaked in Some questions asking, why does he want your head shaved? At first, I thought it was because she had cancer, but that clearly wasn't the case. The girl whispered quietly to me, he wants to get me tattoos. I was so confused. Tattoos? What kind of tattoos need a shaved head? When it was time for the shave, I kept trying to stall and save time. I started cutting her ends. But her father caught on to what I was doing. He walked up to me and said, if you don't hurry up, I'll take you around back, and you'll wish you had just used the clippers. I told him, yes, sir. But as he walked away, I saw it. On the back of his neck was the Buddhist symbol of peace. If you know, you know. Thankfully, my coworker had seen everything and had already called the cops. So I kept on stalling. And before I knew it, the man was arguing with the police officers. And I held on to that poor girl as she cried. She screamed at the officers to take away her daddy. And so they did.

My dad caught our neighbour stealing packages off our porch, but didn't say a word to anyone about it for months. This had been going on since we moved to the neighbourhood. We'd get delivery notification, but find nothing at our door. My mom kept complaining to Amazon about missing packages, filing reports, getting refunds. The neighbor was smart about it, too. Rick, who worked from home and had perfected his technique. He'd wait exactly 15 minutes after the delivery truck left, then casually stroll over like he was checking his own mail, grab our stuff and head back inside like nothing happened. Dad started keeping a notebook. Time, names, dates, what got stolen. Mom thought he was being obsessive, but he had a plan brewing. He started ordering worthless junk online just to mess with Rick. Expired vitamins from sketchy websites, broken phone accessories that didn't work. Random magazines about hobbies nobody cares about. Stuff that cost almost nothing but came in official looking packages that would fool a thief. Every few days, another decoy package would arrive. Rick kept taking them like clockwork, probably thinking he'd hit the Jackpot with neighbors who ordered so much. Dad would place the order and wait by the window with his notebook. This went on for three weeks. Dad was building something, but wouldn't tell us what. Then dad escalated phase 2. He found this website that sells glitter packages specifically designed for pranking Package thieves ordered the biggest one they had, the kind that explodes rainbow glitter everywhere when someone opens it. The description promised it would take weeks to clean up. But he also made a phone call. Turns out his college roommate Tom, works for the United States Postal Inspection Service. Dad had been documenting everything for weeks. Times, dates, photos through the window, even video footage of Rick's theft routines. Stealing mail is a federal crime. And Tom explained they'd been looking for solid evidence against repeat offenders in our area. Dad had basically built them a perfect case without realizing it. The morning the glitter explosive arrived, dad positioned himself at the kitchen window with his phone charged and ready. Right on schedule. Rick emerged from his house at two PM, looked around to make sure no one was watching, walked over to our porch with that same casual stride he'd perfected over months of systematic theft. Dad hit record as Rick grabbed the package and head back to his house. This time, dad actually followed him outside, filming from across the street as Rick disappeared through his front door with what he thought was another free prize. We waited inside. Dad kept checking his watch. Mom asked what was happening, but dad just held up.

My mom called it truth night. Every month, our whole family sat in a circle. One person had to confess their biggest secret or lie from the past month. If you refuse to share, you got punished. I was eight when it started. My older sister went first. She admitted to breaking Mom's favourite vase and blaming our dog. Mom just nodded and wrote it down in her little black notebook. The first red flag came when my teacher, Missus Williams, called mom about my essay on my family. I'd written about truth night, thinking it was normal. Missus Williams asked if I felt safe at home. And next day, mom pulled me aside and said Missus Williams had misunderstood our beautiful family tradition. And that I needed to be more careful about what I shared with outsiders. That's when mom started coaching us. Before school, she'd practice conversations with us, teaching us exactly what to say if anyone asked about our home life. We're a very close, honest family, she'd make us repeat. Things escalated when my best friend, Tyler, came for a sleepover. Mom insisted he participate in truth night. Tyler looked confused, but confessed to lying about finishing his homework. Mom wrote it down and asked him personal questions about his parents marriage. Tyler never came back to our house. My sister started getting mysterious bruises. When I asked, she said they were from private truth sessions with mom. Apparently, If your monthly confession wasn't deep enough, you got individual meetings where mom would keep pushing until you broke down completely. Dad tried to intervene once. Said truth night was getting out of hand and maybe we should stop. That night, mom made him participate for the first time. She forced him to confess to an affair he'd had five years ago in front of all us kids. He never questioned truth night again. This school counselor, Mister Bennett, started asking me weird questions. Did I feel comfortable talking to my parents? Did I have secrets I couldn't share? I lied and said everything was perfect. But I could tell he didn't believe me. Mom must have suspected, because she started homeschooling us the next week. Now isolated from the outside world, truth night became a daily occurrence. Mom said we needed intensive honesty training since we were no longer getting corrupted by outside influences. My brother started having seizures from the stress. When I begged mom to take him to a doctor, she said his seizures were just his body releasing suppressed lies. Our neighbor, Missus Foster, called child services after hearing my brother screaming during one of his seizures. When the social worker arrived, mom had coached us perfectly. We sat in the living room like perfect children, explaining how much we loved our honesty circles and how they brought our family closer together. The social worker left satisfied, but Missus Foster didn't give up. She started recording The sounds coming from our house. And gathered evidence. One day, she knocked on our door with two police officers. Mom wasn't prepared this time. As the officers questioned us separately, I finally broke. I told them about the daily fashions, the bruises, my brother's seizures, and how terrified we all were. My sister and brother confirmed everything. That's when the real truth came out. While searching mom's room, police found her communications with Doctor Sarah Mitchell from the university psychology department. Mom wasn't just a disturbed

Okay, so I grew up thinking I was allergic to chocolate. Like, deathly allergic. My parents had me convinced since I was literally a toddler that even the smallest piece would send me into anaphylactic shock. They had this whole system. Special notes to all my teachers, special talks with my friends, parents before sleepovers, the whole nine yards. It affected everything. Birthday parties were a nightmare growing up because everyone else would be eating cake and ice cream while I'd be sitting there with my special treats my mom packed. Halloween was the worst, tbh. I'd go trick or treating with friends, but then have to trade away like 75% of my candy haul for the safe stuff. My mom would literally inspect my entire bag and confiscate anything with even a trace of chocolate. My dad, Donald, was especially strict about it. He'd check restaurant dessert menus before we went anywhere. Would interrogate servers about ingredients. Once he made this huge scene at restaurant because he thought they were lying about whether the vanilla ice cream had been scooped with the same scoop as the chocolate. I was so embarrassed, I wanted to disappear for our. The thing is, I never questioned it. Like, why would I? Parents don't just make up life threatening allergies for their kid. I wore a medical alert bracelet. They kept an Epipen in the House. When I was 12, my mom, Sylvia, made me practice jabbing myself with the trainer pen so I know what to do if I accidentally ate chocolate when she wasn't around. I still remember how serious she looked when she told me, this could save your life one day. Throughout high school, it became part of my identity in this weird way. I was Ava, the girl who'll die if she eats a Hershey's kiss. My friends were super protective, too. Tom, my best friend's boyfriend, once tackled a kid who was trying to dare me to eat a chocolate chip cookie as a joke. Everyone treated it like this deadly serious thing because that's what my parents had told them. I never even questioned it until I was 27. 27 years old. Can you believe that? Like, I went through my entire childhood, teen years, college, halfway through my 20s, believing I had this life threatening condition. So here's how I found out. I was at this work conference in Chicago, staying at a hotel. After a long day of boring presentations, I got back to my room, and there was this little chocolate mint on my pillow. I was exhausted and not really paying attention, and I just ate it without thinking. It was in my mouth before I even realized what I was doing. And then it hit me. I just eaten chocolate. My heart started racing immediately. I ran to the bathroom looking for hives. Or swelling, waiting for my throat to close up. I was freaking out, like, literally on the floor of this hotel bathroom having a full blown panic attack. I called the front desk screaming about needing an ambulance because I was having an allergic reaction. The paramedics came super fast. They checked all my vitals, looked at my skin, monitored my breathing, and nothing, absolutely nothing was happening. One of them asked if I was sure I was allergic to chocolate. I told them about my lifelong severe allergy, and they were like, have you ever actually had a reaction before? And I realized, no, I hadn't because my parents have been so careful. I'd never actually eaten chocolate before. The paramedics suggested I might wanna get an allergy test done just to be sure. They were super nice about it, but I could tell they thought I was overreacting. I was so embarrassed. After they left, I sat there for hours just trying to process everything. The next day, I called my doctor back home and explained what happened. She was confused because there was nothing about a chocolate allergy in my medical records. Nothing. She agreed to schedule allergy testing. When I got back, two weeks later, I'm sitting in an allergist office getting tested for chocolate allergies. The results? Absolutely nothing. No allergic response whatsoever. The doctor looked confused and asked who had diagnosed me originally. When I said my parents, she gave me this look. I'll Never forget. I confronted my parents that weekend. I was shaking when I told them what happened. I expected them to be shocked or confused, but instead, my mom just started crying. My dad got all quiet and weird. Then he finally said, we never thought you'd actually eat it. Turns out, when I was three, my older brother Hector had died. I barely remember him, but apparently he had a severe peanut allergy and died from anaphylaxis after accidentally eating something with peanuts at a birthday party. My parents were absolutely devastated. After he died, they became obsessed with protecting me. But instead of just being normally cautious parents, they decided to tell me I was deathly allergic to chocolate, something they could easily control and keep away from me. They thought if I believed I had a deadly allergy, I'd be more careful about what I ate in general.

I own a franchise that my family started when I was younger. I was the only one who wanted to take over the family business, so my father ended up giving it to me. My father gave me two restaurants before he passed away, and currently I have 12 restaurants. I hired my family members, including my nephews and my kids, to manage my stores so they can learn to expand the family business when I'm gone. I never forced them to manage my restaurants, but I showed them my wealth when they were teenagers and explained that if they wanted the lifestyle and comfort I had, I was giving them the opportunity to achieve it. All of them understood that if they wanted to have a piece of my restaurants, they had to learn how to be entrepreneurs and run a business. My oldest son, 30, manages four stores. My daughter, 28, owns three stores. My youngest, 24, two stores, and my nephew, 26, three stores. I'm proud of what they've accomplished, and I feel very confident that my hard work will be taken care of when I'm no longer here. Every now and then, I like to visit one of my restaurants randomly to ensure that everything is up to their standards and running correctly. I'm a simple guy and have no interest in buying expensive clothes to impress others. My family even says that if they Didn't know me. I'd fit in with the homeless people. I opened the door and waited in the lobby with three other people who had families. All of them except me were taken care of and seated within the next five minutes. I waited and one waitress looked at me and continued walking, grinning. Next thing you know, another waitress walked past me and ignored me, and now two families had come in and both waitresses seated them. At this point, I was shocked and completely speechless about what I was witnessing, especially since my restaurants are known for having excellent customer service. I got tired and decided to go up and ask the same waitress if I could be seated. Her smile faded away and she gave me an annoyed look when I stopped her. After saying excuse me, I apologized and asked when I would be seated because I had been waiting patiently for more than 45 minutes. The waitress, still annoyed, looked at me and told me to wait patiently while someone would come to seat me. Five minutes later, another family came in and asked to be seated, and the same waitress immediately took them to an empty table. At the this point, I knew she was judging me based on my appearance and I was getting frustrated. I decided I didn't want to waste any more time and left the restaurant ten minutes later. I left fuming with anger, never having felt so disrespected in My life. I decided to come back 30 minutes before closing, around the time my son usually returns to the store to do paperwork. When I walked in, first thing I saw was the same waitress in the lobby. She saw me and gave me the biggest side eye full of attitude. She scoffed and said, you again? Didn't you get the hint the first time? Again, I was shocked and said, excuse me? Do you not know how to treat people with respect? She looked even more annoyed and said, listen, old man, we're about to close and this restaurant doesn't serve, you know, people who dress like you. I was completely speechless and angry, to the point where I even started getting mad at my son for hiring this girl. I had had enough. Just as I was about to start yelling, my son walked by and said, dad, what are you doing here? I looked at him angrily and said, who the hell is this girl, and how the hell did you manage to hire someone so disrespectful? My son, already looking worried, tried to calm me down and then turned to the waitress in a quiet, serious tone. My son looked at her and said, my office now. I had some time to calm myself down, and as I walked into my son's office, I looked at the waitress and said, I want your friend here too. I hadn't forgotten about

When my girlfriend slapped me across the face for the first time, it hurt a lot. But I thought it was just something all girlfriends did. So I just laughed it off and told her not to do it again. Because other than that, she was my dream girl. Cook me homemade chicken Alfredo whenever I was sad. She was the first girl to ever get me flowers. And even six months into the relationship, when I paid for our meals together, she's just as grateful as she was on our first date. Plus, it wasn't until eight months into our relationship that flip had switched, because it was around this time that she found out her dad had been cheating on her mom. It started off small. She'd grab my phone when I got texts just to check who it was. She'd get upset if I talked to my godmother about a book she wrote. You don't need to smile that much when you talk to her. She'd say about the cashier at target. Then came the accusations. If I was five minutes late from work, I was cheating. If I didn't answer her texts immediately, I was with another girl. She'd slap me playfully when other women walked by, but her nails would leave marks when I mentioned it hurt. She'd cry about how I didn't understand what she was going through with her family falling apart. Then came the night where Stella pushed Me off the balcony. Luckily, I lived on the first floor of my apartment building. I was just left with two broken ribs and a dislocated shoulder. When I went to the hospital, I told all the nurses that I had just played too much basketball. the other people in my life were already really suspicious of stuff, so I didn't tell them either. But no matter how much she cried to the doctors or posted about how proud she was of me, there was one woman who wasn't buying into her BS, and that woman was my stepmom. She showed up at my apartment the next day with groceries and her laptop. I'm starting a YouTube channel. She announced home organization and cleaning tips. Barry Marie condo meets suburban mom. I thought she lost her mind. She was a tax attorney who could barely operate the TV remote. She sort of gilded me into being her co host using the I pushed you out of me card. And she set up cameras all around my apartment. The bathroom, the kitchen, even my bedroom. At the time, she claimed it was so our audience could get the full experience. The genius part. Stella thought it was pathetic. Desperate stepmom trying to bond with me through a silly project. She'd mock the videos, call my stepmom cringe, but she never saw her as a threat. Just another stupid woman in my life. During filming, my stepmom would forget to turn Off her phone that was recording voice memos for content ideas. She'd schedule emergency reshoots whenever she noticed fresh bruises, making sure to get them on camera. While pretending to film my hands organizing drawer dividers. I had no idea that the whole time, she was just documenting everything. We were three weeks into our channel when Stella lost it. We saw a comment from a woman saying I had nice hands in our drawer organization video. The camera caught Stella attacking me with a kitchen knife, screaming about how I was just like her father, and how she'd make sure no woman ever looked at me again. When I tried to escape, she cornered me, saying she'd tell everyone I abused her if I ever left. That's when my stepmom walked back in, claiming she'd forgotten her lap.

She's my dad's older sister, and there's like this unspoken rule that we don't talk about certain things around her or ask her certain questions. Growing up, I just thought maybe she was super sensitive or had depression or something, but the way everyone acts is way too strange for it to be just that. Whenever she visits, which is rare, maybe once every two to three years, my parents start acting so weird. Like a week before my mom deep clean the entire house, rearranges furniture, and hide certain family photos, my dad gets all quiet and starts drinking more than usual, and they both give me and my brother this weird lecture about being respectful and not bringing up the past, even though they never explain what past we're not supposed to bring up. The last time she visited before this weekend was at my cousin Edwin's graduation party three years ago. Everyone was having a good time until Uncle Rowland made some joke about how Edwin's girlfriend looked like someone from the family and the entire room went silent. My Aunt Alana just got up and left without saying anything. No one went after her. No one explained why that comment was so bad. Everyone just pretended nothing happened and kept eating cake. The mood Was completely ruined. So fast forward to this weekend. My parents were hosting a birthday dinner for my cousin Amber. She's 25, and somehow Aunt Alana agreed to come, which was already surprising because she usually skips these things. My mom spent three days cleaning and rearranging stuff. She even took down the family portrait from our living room wall, which was super weird because that photo has been there since I was like, 12. When Aunt Alana arrived, I swear the temperature in the room dropped like 10 degrees. Everyone was being polite, but so awkward. My dad kept refilling her wine glass like he was trying to get her drunk or something. And my mom kept starting random conversations whenever there was even a second of silence. My brother, he's 19, kept giving me these looks across the table like, WTF is happening? Because the tension was unbearable. Then during dessert, Amber started talking about how she's been using one of those DNA ancestry websites to make a family tree for her anthropology class. The moment she mentioned this, my dad literally choked on his drink, and my mom dropped a spoon so loudly, I jumped. Aunt Alana just sat there with this weird smile that didn't reach her eyes at all. Amber kept going, completely oblivious to the tension, about how she found some interesting patterns in our family history, how she wanted to interview everyone for her project. When she asked Aunt Alana if she'd be Willing to talk about the family history from her perspective, my Uncle William practically shouted about needing more ice for the drinks and dragged Amber to the kitchen. I was so confused and honestly kind of angry at this point because I felt like I was the only one not in on some huge family secret. So after dinner, when everyone was in the living room, I decided to follow Antilana when she went outside for some air. She was standing on our back porch just staring at the stars, and I awkwardly asked if she was enjoying the party. She gave me this look that was so sad, it actually made my stomach hurt. she asked me if I'd ever felt like I didn't belong in my own family. Before I could answer, she said something about how blood isn't always thicker than water and how some secrets should stay buried. I was about to ask her what she meant when my dad came running outside looking panicked. He tried to act casual, but I could tell he was freaking out that I was alone with Aunt Elena. He made some excuse about my mom needing help with the coffee and practically dragged me back inside. Later that night, after everyone left, I confronted my parents. I told them I was tired of being treated like a child and demanded to know what the big deal was with Aunt Alana. They tried to change the subject at first. But I wouldn't let it go. I said I was going to ask her directly next time if they wouldn't tell me. That's when my mom started crying

When my wife Emma and I found out we were having our first baby, we were over the moon. We spent weeks picking the perfect name. Oliver James. It felt right. Strong, but not too trendy. Classic, but not boring. We told everyone at my mom's birthday dinner when Emma was four months along. My. My older brother Jake just nodded and said, cool choice, while bouncing his two year old on his lap. His wife, Casey smiled and congratulated us. Everything seemed normal. Two months later, Jake called with big news. Casey was pregnant again. We were excited. Our kids would be close in age, maybe even best friends growing up. At Emma's baby shower, Casey was showing off her little bump to all the aunts. Someone asked if they'd picked names yet. Casey got this weird smile and said, well, if it's a boy, we're thinking Oliver James. The room went dead quiet. Emma's fork clattered onto her plate. I felt my face get hot. That's our name, I said, trying to keep my voice steady. We announced it months ago. Jake shrugged. It's a family name, bro. Grandpa Oliver, remember? We have just as much right to use it. That was complete bullshit. My grandpa went by Ali, and his middle name was Robert, not James. Jake was just making stuff up. Emma started crying right there at her own baby shower. My mom tried to smooth things over. Saying there could be two Olivers in the family. But Emma whispered to me that she couldn't handle having our special name stolen. That night. I was furious. I'd always been the little brother who got Jake's hand me downs, but this was our baby's name. Our one thing. Then I remembered something from college. My roommate had switched majors using some obscure policy buried in the student handbook that nobody ever read. Maybe there was something similar here. I spent three hours digging through old family documents my mom had given us for genealogy stuff. Birth certificates, marriage licenses, the works. And I found it. A handwritten family tree from 1987 that my great aunt had made. Right there in her careful cursive, it showed our great, great grandfather's full name. Oliver James Patterson. Not just Oliver, but Oliver James. The exact combination we'd chosen. I took a photo and sent it to Jake with a text. Found this in the family papers. Looks like Oliver James actually is a family name. Since Emma and I announced it first. And we're having our baby first. I think tradition says we get it. Jake tried to argue, but I could tell he was scrambling. He called me 20 minutes later, clearly having Googled family naming traditions. Fine, he said. But if Casey has a boy, we're using just Oliver. Whatever, I replied, as long as it's not Oliver James. Emma gave birth three weeks early. Our son came into the World as Oliver James. He was perfect. When Jake and Casey visited us in the hospital, Jake actually seemed happy for us. He held Oliver and said he looked just like our grandpa. Two months later, Casey had her baby, a healthy boy. They named him Oliver. At first, I felt bad. Maybe I'd been too aggressive about the whole thing. But then at the first family gathering with both babies, something amazing happened. My mom was holding both babies and got confused. Which Oliver is which? She asked, laughing. Casey looked annoyed. This is just Oliver, she said, gesturing to her son. That's Oliver James. From that day on, everyone called our son by his full name to avoid confusion. Oliver James became his identity. While Jake's son was just Oliver. Our boy got

When I was younger, I lived with my mom, my stepdad, and my younger half brother. My brother was always their favourite because my mom hated seeing me, as I reminded her of my dad, whom she had cheated on, and for some reason she blamed me for it. I was often ignored and left out. For years I tried to ignore this and get by, but the situation became unbearable when I was about 14 years old. My brother was spoiled and always got what he wanted. He was really into video games, and over time he started complaining that the house didn't have enough space for him to have his own game room, something he had seen somewhere and now wanted. My parents then started hinting that I should leave the house so my brother could use my room as his game room. At first I thought they were joking, since they often told me to leave the house and that my presence there was useless, but then I realized they were serious. They began pressuring me to leave, saying that I was practically an adult and it was time to move on. I told them that I wasn't even old enough to have a job yet. Had nowhere to go and was far from being an adult. But as time passed, they decided it was time for me to go. And one day, I came home from school to find all my belongings thrown on the sidewalk. It was incredibly tough. I had to go from shelter to shelter until an angel appeared and adopted me. She was a police officer who lived near the shelter where I stayed the most, and we got to know each other. A few months later, she took me to live with her and eventually adopted me. Honestly, if it weren't for her, I don't know how I would have managed to move forward. Years went by, and I did my best to move on. I worked hard, studied, and saved enough money to buy my own house with my own business. I couldn't have done it without my adoptive mother for sure, as she financed my education and helped me pay to start my business. Now that things were going well for me, I also bought a house for her so she could get out of renting. However, when my biological family found out that I had bought a house and a house for my adoptive mother, apparently because the guy who sold me the house was a friend of my family, everything got worse again.

What made you stop drinking? When I was 16, my whole family died in a car accident. I was the only one who made it. One second, we were driving home from my sister's soccer game, laughing at something dumb. The next, I woke up in a hospital bed with a doctor standing over me, looking like he didn't want to be the one to say it. After that, I shut down. I had no close family, so they put me in foster care. The people who took me in barely acknowledged me. They made me sleep in the shed when I pissed them off. Some nights I went to bed hungry. I started sneaking out, getting strangers to buy me whatever cheap liquor I could get my hands on. By 18, I was homeless. My routine was simple. Wake up, go to work, buy booze, pass out, eat. I had no reason to stop. I didn't care if I woke up the next morning or not. Then one night, I was drinking outside a gas station when a cop pulled up. I kept my head down, waiting for him to tell me to move or arrest me. Instead, he leaned against his car and said, you even old enough for that? I shrugged. Yeah, basically. He looked at me for a second, then nodded toward his car. Get in. I figured, what the hell? Maybe a night in a cell would be better than this. But he didn't Take me to the station. He went inside the gas station and returned with a coffee and a bag of food. He handed them to me and said, eat. I stared at the bag. It had been a while since someone told me to eat like they actually cared. I didn't say much, but he got me to talk. I told him I had no one, no home, nothing. Listened, then told me to wait at the station until his shift ended. That night, he brought me to his place. Couch is yours, he said, tossing me a blanket. We'll figure things out in the morning. I don't know why, but I told him everything. My family, the drinking, the foster home. He just nodded like none of it surprised him. Then he told me he lost his wife in a car accident, too. Said he got it. He didn't try to fix me. He didn't lecture me. He just helped. Took me to get a new I D. Since mine was long gone. Helped me get a better job. Kept his fridge stocked and told me to eat whatever I wanted. If I disappeared for days on a Bender, he didn't yell. He just said, you done? When I stumbled back through the door one time, he found me passed out in my car and didn't say a word. Just opened the door, pulled me up and walked me inside. Sat me down at the kitchen table and put A plate of food in front of me. I could barely keep my eyes open. But I remember him saying, you keep doing this, you're gonna end up like the guys I scrape off the sidewalk at 3:00am. Laughed. Maybe that's the plan. He didn't laugh. Just shook his head and said, nah, not you. I didn't believe him, but something about the way he said it stuck with me. One day he came home and said, listen, I can get you into a program. Law enforcement. You just gotta sober up first. I wanted to say yes. I wanted to believe I could do it. But I couldn't. I told him no. Then one night, he didn't come home. The next morning, I saw the headline. Cop was shot in the line of duty. My stomach dropped. I ran to the hospital and pushed past the nurses until I found his room. He was unconscious, hooked up to machines. They said he'd live, but he'd need help. I told them I'd do it. For weeks.

I grew up in this crazy household where literally any food was up for grabs. Like, you could make dinner, put leftovers in the fridge with your name on it, and wake up the next morning to find someone already ate half of it. My three brothers and my sister acted like our kitchen was some kind of free for all buffet. I'd buy groceries with my part time job money, make myself lunch for school, and come back to find it gone. Every single time. So I got creative. I started drowning everything I made in lemon juice. And I mean drowning it. Like, I'd squeeze an entire lemon on my pasta, my rice, my sandwiches, everything. At first it was gross, but honestly, I got used to it pretty quick. Actually started liking the taste. The best part? Nobody touched my food anymore. They'd open containers, see my lemon soaked leftovers, and immediately close them back up. Finally, my food was safe. Kept doing this even after I moved out for college and got my own apartment. Just became this weird habit, you know? Like some people put hot sauce on everything, I put lemon on everything. My roommates thought it was gross, but whatever, it was my food. Fast forward to last month. I went on this girl's trip to Miami with five of my friends from college. Split the Airbnb and activities evenly, but everyone paid for their Own food. Since Beth has celiac disease and Jenna's vegetarian and all that, we've been going out to dinner every night to these nice restaurants. I always ask the server for extra lemons. Usually got, like, four or five wedges. And squeeze them all over my food before eating. My friends were used to it by then. They'd roll their eyes and make jokes about how I was probably getting scurvy in reverse or something, but nobody really cared. On the third morning, we're all sitting around the kitchen island eating breakfast, when Beth suddenly goes, okay, I have to say something. You're making food completely inedible for other people. I was confused as hell. I looked around at everyone's plates. Nobody was eating my food. We all had our own separate breakfasts. I was like, what are you talking about? I'm only putting lemon on my own food. She crossed her arms and got this attitude, well, some of us stay up late and want snacks, and your leftovers are the only option sometimes. That's when it clicked. This whole time, Beth had been eating everyone's restaurant leftovers. After we all went to bed. Like, we'd come back from dinner, put our containers in the fridge. She'd apparently go through them later, like it was her personal midnight buffet. I started laughing because it was so ridiculous. Beth, you're mad at me because you can't steal my leftovers. He got super defensive. I'm not stealing anything. It's just how The rest of us feel about food sharing. I looked around the table. The rest of us. None of my other friends said anything. They just stared down at their plates, looking uncomfortable. Beth kept going, we're all friends here. Food should be communal. You're being selfish. I was getting pretty annoyed at this point. If you want my leftovers, just ask. But don't get mad at me for protecting my food in a way that literally doesn't affect anyone else. The breakfast table went.

The child was a mini version of him, but called his arch enemy dad. My sister had just returned to the country when my husband handed me a divorce agreement saying our marriage was over. My heart felt like it was being torn apart, but I signed it through the pain. Then, carrying his child, I married his arch enemy. Four years later, he looked at the kid, a mini version of himself, calling his rival dad. His eyes turned red. The pregnancy test showed two lines. Before I could be happy, David threw a piece of paper in my face. Cherry, let's get a divorce. Sign this agreement and I'll give you an extra 20 million. I looked at the well dressed, cold faced man in front of me and couldn't nod. David was getting impatient. When we got married, we signed a contract. Our marriage term is three years. It ends in one month. If you don't agree now, the contract will end automatically in a month. But then you won't get a dime of the extra 20 million. I took a deep breath. David, what if I told you I was pregnant? I admit I was desperate. Even at this point I was trying to use the child to keep David. David's family didn't have many heirs, so for the kid's sake, maybe he'd give Up the divorce. But David's next words chilled me. I had a vasectomy. The kid can't be mine. My mouth opened, but no sound came out. David was my only man. If it wasn't his, whose was it? When someone doesn't believe you, any explanation is useless. David left. I stared blankly at the divorce agreement. My marriage to David was messy. Three years ago, the one supposed to marry David was my sister. But she left the country close to the wedding to chase true love. To keep the cooperation between our families, my family had me marrying her place. David's family agreed for the sake of face. I had a crush on David for seven years, so I didn't refuse. The only unwilling person was David. I didn't know what other people's wedding nights were like. On mine, David tossed me a contract. The same three year marriage contract. After three years, no matter my wishes, the marriage would end automatically. I felt lost and pained at the time. But I didn't give up. I thought if I treated David well, he'd warm up to me. My sister was abroad and I was by his side. One day, he'd seen my worth. For three years, I cared for him meticulously. He had stomach issues. I studied recipes. He had headaches and trouble sleeping. I Learned acupuncture. In hindsight, I was too naive. Who would fall for a nanny? Forget it. We were just torturing each other. I trembled. Trying to sign the divorce papers. Suddenly my phone rang. It was my mom. Cherry, your sister is back. She's on the afternoon flight tonight. Come home with David for a family dinner. My mom sounded unusually happy. I spoke my voice hoarse. Why did she come back suddenly

I was an ER nurse on a military base. There was an accident during training. Accidents happen all day every day, but this one was a flight incident. Flight incidents are a big deal. People die and multi million dollar aircrafts are destroyed. This accident was no different. My patient was the pilot who ejected and survived. Unfortunately, everyone else on the flight did not. The accident was considered my patient's fault, so they brought the guy in. He walked in and was fine, but was wrecked with survivors guilt. I was the highest ranking nurse in the ER that day, and for that reason, the flight incident documentation was assigned to me. I was to perform the mandated blood draw to test the pilot for substances or alcohol. The room was somber. Deaths of people who were close to each other, like brothers, are easily the hardest thing to get through. The pilot's entire squadron, all his bosses, his bosses, bosses were there. I drew his blood. And it's a chain of custody, which means every person who touches the vials has to sign who they handed them off to. For legal purposes. It's all to verify that no one tampered or switched out a vial. I don't know why, but I drew excess blood. Probably because it was my habit to draw a vial or two extra in case a doctor wanted to add tests. So I wouldn't have to stick a patient with a needle twice. When I gathered my trash up, I put them in my pocket. I don't know why I did this. I usually would have just thrown them away, but I had them with me. When the pilot was discharged, his squadron went and got drunk together as they attempted to pull the pilot from an abyss of self blame. I suppose it is important when that's your job, to get past it so you can fly again. And I'm not going to judge anyone for how they managed to do that. It's got to be difficult going back to work with the same people, all of you, knowing you were piloting during an accident that killed other people. So they get a pass to go get blackout drunk. But not an hour after they left, the lab called me. There was a problem. The chain of custody. Blood draws needed to be drawn again. Someone had dropped the first ones on the floor and smashed it into a million pieces. Now he was at a bar getting drunk, and I had to call him and have him come in to get a new blood test. It would not be clean. He would have alcohol in his blood. But I still had to have him come in. Everyone understood the ramifications of what was happening. With alcohol in his blood sample that was taken for his flight incident, he would Be court martialed. There would be a trial, he would get charges, and he would do a lot of time in the slammer. His commanding officer came with him, and his expression was great. The pilot's fate was sealed. Unless he told the truth, that this was a redraw and that it happened well after the pilot was off duty. But that meant the flight incident report had no blood drawn, which would end this pilot's career. Walking the pilot into the room where I was drawing his blood was like walking the career to the gallows. The whole time I did the paperwork and drew the blood, I knew what I had to do.

And after a few minutes she noticed and she thought I didn't like it. She asked me if I didn't like the food and I said I just pretended I was feeling sick. I would. Dude, I would have been so gross that, like, I've been with my girlfriend like a year and a half now and I don't even know that she does that still. And I don't ever plan on knowing that she does that, so. Alright, Danny, I can understand why that would be a turn off for you. Yeah, that's why I shook her hand. I just. I needed to get out of there. All right, Danny, thank you very much for being honest. I'm sorry you had to endure that date. Yeah, thanks. I mean, I'm Sorry, too. Like that. Is that all you. That you guys needed today, or. Yeah, that's just about everything. Um, I'll let her know. Actually, why don't you let her know what the problem was on the date? Because she's actually listening and on the other line right now. Oh.

Hi, 1 3. 1 3 Estra Drive, Boulder City, Nevada. And what's the problem? Tell me exactly what happened. My name is Hans Walters. I work for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. I just shot and killed my son, Max, and my wife, Michelle. And I killed her because she's in such chronic pain from her neck and back and on more medicines that she's not gonna survive. I've also set the house on fire. And if the fire department comes to my house, because there's a fire hydrant right in front of my house, uh, I'm gonna open fire on them. So I have to wait till the house is burning, and then I'm gonna shoot myself. Okay? So. Okay, sir, I. Don't ask me any questions. This is. This is real. This is a joke. The fire alarms in the background is because I set the garage and the bedroom on fire. My wife's in the bedroom. I shot her in the head. My son, unfortunately, is in Molinar watching Oswald, and I shot him in the head, too. And, uh, forgive me for my sins. Please don't call back. Thank you.

Now she wants mine because it's bigger. For some context, I, twenty nine f, have an older sister, 34F. About five years ago, our mom died and her money was split in between us. The house, though, was going to go to whoever had a child first. I was 24 at the time of my mom's death and clearly didn't plan to have children anytime soon. So when my sister announced her pregnancy one year after mom's death, I wasn't upset. I wasn't even sure I wanted the house in the first place, since it wasn't my style. Eventually, I met my husband, 30M, and we got our own house. My husband makes a lot of money, and the house he bought is almost three times the size of the house my mom had left behind. As of today, my sister has four children and is currently pregnant with her fifth child. I, on the other hand, just got pregnant with my first child. My sister and her husband came over for dinner the other day. She brought up the fact that I was pregnant with my first child and how she already had four, about to be five. I questioned her because I wasn't sure where this was going. And then she said the following. I mean, you and Alexander, my husband, only want two kids. Why don't we switch houses? I could have this one, And you take mom's house? I would appreciate it. It would really help with space. And you would make me and your niece and nephew so happy. I laughed out loud. The house mom had left behind was big, and it was more than enough space for a fifth child. I know my sister wants my house because it's more modern looking than mom's. I replied by asking her if she was mentally ill and if she felt okay. I was joking. I will admit it wasn't the best thing to say, but it was the first thing my brain could process to say. With that, she started screaming. She called me selfish and asked if I had no compassion for her. She went on and on about how I know her and her husband are struggling with money and that the old house just wasn't doing it for her. I yelled back and told her to get out of my house. With that, her and her family left. Her husband was glaring at me the whole time. And my husband couldn't do anything but laugh because he found the situation ridiculous. Since then, I've received texts from distant family members saying things such as, your sister never asks you for anything. Just do her one favour. And your mother didn't die for you to treat your sister like an animal. All I did was tell her no. And everyone's acting like I'm evil. Their words have really made me Rethink if I did the right thing

Doug, this is Scott Brand from the Colorado Springs Police Department Homicide Division. Do you have a second? Um, sure. What's up? I need to talk to you about a Sabrina. Okay. Is she okay? Do you know a Sabrina? Yeah, she's my fiance. Okay. Yeah. Doug, you could be in grave danger. What? What do you mean? Do you know if this line is secure that we're speaking on right now? Um, as far as I know, I'm calling you to warn you that your fiance, as you know, spent some time here in Colorado. Right. And we can't prove it, but I wanted to call and personally warn you. Warn me? Yes. We believe that she's killed her past two husbands. What? What? You can't be talking about my fiance. She's 5 6, short brown hair, born June 24th, 1984. Sabrina? Oh, my god. Babe. Yeah, that. That's her. How much do you know about her past? Well, I knew she was married once before. Uh, I mean, we haven't been together that long, but I guess I don't know a lot. But, I mean, I don't know. I mean, she doesn't really talk about it. Doug, you are in deep, and you really need to listen to me. Okay? She's known as the Colorado Springs Black Widow. Black Widow? She marries men, and then she poisons their breakfast and then collects the insurance money. Does she make you breakfast every day? Yeah. Oh, my god. I don't, I. This is freaking me out. Listen, listen, I know this is hard to hear, and if you don't believe me, go ahead and Google it. The cases will come up, and I've been trying to track her down and thank god that I found her and found you. What do I do? So have you been eating the breakfasts that she makes you every morning? Yeah. Oh, god. How are you feeling? Are you feeling okay? Actually, I'm homesick from work today. Oh, no. I hate to tell you this, but you have got to seek some medical attention soon. Oh, my god. She's not coming home soon, is she? She's gone? Yeah, she's out till tonight. Doug, she may be outside watching you at this very moment. What do you mean? I don't want to freak you out, but that's a possibility. She may be outside watching you. You're not near a window, are you? Yes. Should I move? Move away from the window. I'm down behind the chair by my bed. Is that. Is that safe? Curl up into a ball, okay? It helps the poison drain faster. And this may be our only option. And I will get the authorities on the line. Yeah. Can you roll from side to side, please? I'm rolling. Say something so I can hear you roll. Ah! Faster, faster, faster! Yes. My thighs kind of hurt. We're gonna get through this. We're gonna be okay. We're gonna get this poison out of you, okay? We got agents heading to your house right now, and I want you just to keep rolling until they get there, okay? Doug? Doug? Doug! Doug! What? I just got a report that she's coming in the front door. You need to hide. What? You need to hide now. Get in a closet. All right, hold on. Doug, you're inside the closet now? Yeah, I've got it cracked open just a little bit, though. Doug, you don't understand. This woman. She mates, she kills, and no man can resist her. I can't believe this is happening. I think I hear her. Don't you dare open that closet no matter what. Oh, my god. How soon did the cops get here? Doug, she moves from husband to husband, killing for insurance money. Oh, my god. Do you know when the cops are gonna get here? I've alerted the authorities. They're on their way. Agents are headed to your house right now. But if she finds you in there, god knows what's gonna happen. Hey, I'm here to talk, Doug. Doug. What? Yeah, I need you to speak to me in a French accent right now. In a French accent? Yes. Why? Listen to me, Doug. If you want to get out of this alive, you'll do what I say. The door to the closet is closed tight. Hey, duck. Yeah, this is actually Jubal from breaking Jubal in the morning doing a Phone tap on you. Sabrina set you up. Are you me? No. Oh, my. I can't believe I fell for that. I was in the closet. It's time to come out of the closet, Doug. Yeah, I guess you're right.

So I made sure the owner never ate in peace again. You ever get kicked out of somewhere for doing exactly what you were told you could do? Yeah, me too. It happened at this grimy little place called Big Benny's. All you can eat buffet. 1499. No time limit, no small print. Just pay, eat, repeat. Or so I thought. Now I'm not some competitive eater or 600 pound menace with bib and back problems. I'm just a guy with an appetite and a grudge against portion control. I hadn't eaten in 24 hours. Why? Because I prepared for this. Fasting, hydrating, mentally visualizing the tray of ribs like it was the Olympic podium. You know, normal stuff. First plate, fried chicken, Mac and cheese, two rolls. Nothing crazy. I'm eating into it. Second plate, more carbs. Potatoes, lasagna, garlic bread. Third, I start seeing staff eyeing me like I'm stealing food from their children. One of the servers actually slowed down as she walked past like I was a suspicious dog growling near her purse. By the fifth plate, I swear the manager was hiding behind the soda machine like I was gonna bite him. Play seven. That's when it got interesting. I went full throttle. Barbecue ribs stacked like Lincoln Logs, a pile of meatballs, three chicken thighs and six brownies. I definitely didn't take from the kids section. I said down, fork in hand. When the manager Finally slithered over with two of his most underpaid teenage minions flanking him like henchmen from a movie. No one finishes. He goes, sir, we're going to have to ask you to leave. You've exceeded reasonable consumption. Excuse me. What? Is there a rule on how much I can eat? I asked. There isn't. But, you know, I actually don't know. Benny, I know you have a sign up front in Comic Sans that says all you can eat. It does not say all. We feel emotionally comfortable watching you eat. So I stood up, and you know what I did? I went back for plate No.. 8. He called the cops. I wish I was kidding. Imagine being mid bite into a drumstick, sauce on your chin, when two actual police officers walk in like you're a suspect in a felony mashed potato incident. They looked at me, then at Benny, then back at me. One of them goes, what exactly did he do? He won't stop eating. There was this long pause, the kind that only happens when someone says something so stupid. Has to be processed in layers. The officer turned to me, look, man, could you just go? He looked embarrassed for the manager. I asked if I could at least finish my plate. Then he said, no. Of course he did. I was dangerous, a biological threat to his bottom line. So I was escorted out of Big Benny's all you can eat buffet. Like I robbed the place at Gravy Point, and as I walked out then he had the nerve to say, you're banned for life loudly in front of other customers. Like I was going to miss the place. Now, most people would move on, chalk it up to a ridiculous story to tell at parties, but I don't.

You know that one guy at every party? The one who thinks he's God's gift to alcohol and women? The guy who says things like, I mix better than I date, and if you can't handle a little fun, go home? Yeah, that guy. For me, that guy had a name. Mason. Mason was the kind of guy who wore sunglasses indoors and took shirtless mirror pics like it was a civic duty. He thought spiking people's drinks was hilarious. Just a little joke, bro, he'd say. Like slipping something into someone's drink was on par with drawing a mustache on a passed out friend. Spoiler alert. It's I found out the hard way. It was during our friend Bailey's New Year's party. Good people, decent music, enough food to soak up the bad decisions. I grabbed a drink off the kitchen island. Non alcoholic cause I was the designated driver. Took a few. It tasted a little weird. Like if regret had a flavor. I figured maybe the soda was flat. Ten minutes later, the room started spinning like it was trying to detach from earth. I barely made it to the bathroom before my legs went full Jello. My heart was racing, skin crawling, and I was suddenly having a deep, personal conversation with the floor tiles. Bailey found me an hour later, curled up like a shrimp in her tub. She called an ambulance. Thank God! Turns out Mason had decided to spy suck the party by adding something to my drink. Something prescription based. Something not meant for conscious humans. He thought it was funny. Dude, you should have seen your face, he said, laughing when I confronted him. Relax, I gave you the light stuff. Ah, yes, just a sprinkle of involuntary coma. How festive. I wanted to punch him, but I'm not stupid. People forget bruises, but they don't forget fear. Especially the kind that seeps in drop by drop. So I made a decision. Mason was going to become terrified of liquids. All of them. The plan took finesse. I couldn't just scream Benge! And run at him with a water balloon. This had to feel like karma was slowly dripping down his neck. And it started with coffee. I knew Mason's routine. Every morning, same cafe, same order. Iced triple espresso with oat milk, vanilla, two pumps of ego. So I applied for a job at that cafe. Not because I needed it, but because revenge requires commitment. After three weeks of being the overly eager new guy, I got barista duty. When Mason walked in, I greeted him with my best you probably don't remember drugging me smile. He didn't recognize me. Perfect. I made his drink. Nothing in it yet, but after handing it to him, I leaned over and said, we've had a few complaints about mold in the oatmeal.

My husband and I had this silly tradition where we'd swap phones for a day every month to keep our trust strong. It was his idea. He said couples who had nothing to hide shouldn't mind it. But last month, swap turned my entire life upside down. That morning started like any other swap day. I handed him my iPhone, he gave me his Android. The first few hours were normal. Just boring work emails and random YouTube notifications. Then at lunch, a message popped up from someone named Nancy work. I can't wait to see you tonight, baby. Got that hotel room you like? My heart stopped. I click the chat history and nearly threw up. Hundreds of messages going back six months. Pictures I wish I could unsee. Hotel receipts, everything. But instead of confronting him immediately, something in me snapped. I remembered we had shared bank accounts, and he always handled the finances. I opened his banking app. Thank god he kept his password saved. That's when I discovered he'd been secretly funneling money into a private account. $40,000 of our savings, gone. Money we've been saving for a house. Money from my parents. I took screenshots of everything, then forwarded them to my email. But I wasn't done. Had eight more hours with his phone, and I was going to make them count. I logged into his Instagram and followed every single one of his co workers. Then I posted all the hotel receipts with Nancy's name circled in red caption guess who's been busy at the Holiday Inn? Next, I texted his mom the screenshots. She always bragged about raising a faithful man. Well, surprise! Then I changed his email, password, and security question just for fun. I also changed his Netflix profile name to Cheating Scumbag. The best part? I texted Nancy from his phone. My wife found out everything. Good luck explaining this to your husband. At six PM he came home with my phone, acting completely normal. He even kissed my cheek like usual. I handed his phone back with the sweetest smile. How was your day, honey? Oh, pretty quiet.

One day, my daughter came back from school and ran into my arms like she was scared. I could feel her shaking, so I took her inside and made some French toast, which was her favorite food. I thought she just had a really bad day and missed being at home, but I couldn't have been more wrong. When she calmed down, she told me, Mommy, something happened today, and I think I'm supposed to tell you about it. An uneasy knot formed itself in my heart when she told me that the school counselor had called her into his office for a special game. He handed my daughter a stuffed unicorn and told her that this new game was very popular with the children, which made my daughter excited and eager to learn. Then the counselor made her point the unicorn between his legs and push on it repeatedly. My daughter told me how he made weird faces at times and then closed his eyes and leaned back. Towards the end, I was so horrified and felt a wave of nausea rush through my body, so I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. What kind of sick person would make a seven year old girl do this kind of thing? Not to mention he worked at a school and it was me who willfully sent my daughter near his vicinity. I kept bouncing between Blaming myself and wanting to burn the entire world. My husband was no longer with us, so it was up to me to stand up for my daughter. I don't know what made me approach the school administration before the police, but that's exactly what I did. And the school administration laughed at me, saying that my daughter was clearly playing a prank. They said they had heard other students make similar jokes about the school counselor and said that parents should teach their kids not to lie. But by the time I made it to the police station, the school had already called them and explained the situation. They thought I was a crazy mother who was trying to give merit to my daughter's filthy lie. I had looked straight into my daughter's eyes when she told me the story, so I knew she was telling the truth. But no one wanted to believe me, and I felt like I was in a nightmare. This is when I remembered something important and ran back home to open my jewelry safe. Inside there was a note that I hadn't looked at for a long time. See, although I was currently a doctor, I had been a very inexperienced nurse at one point. And one time, a very stern looking man with a lot of face tattoos walked into our hospital with a bullet wound. No other nurse wanted to treat him since he looked so scary, so they sent me I convinced myself that everyone deserves treatment and cleaned his wounds with the utmost concentration. I even engaged him in conversation and joked about how he should stay away from bullets in the future. When it was all over, the guy thanked me and handed me a note with his phone number on it. Said, if you ever need someone taken care of, I won't ask for any payment. I typed in that phone number and to my surprise, it actually connected. I told him who I was and he said, I remember you.

But I almost called someone who trusted me with their life. I'm a heart surgeon and in the early stages of my addiction, I promised myself I'd never operate high. I told myself I was in control and I could stop at any time. As you can guess, it didn't take long for me to show up to a projected 17 hour surgery absolutely smacked. I'd operated while intoxicated before this. I was used to that, but this was a whole different level of smack. I was on like four different substances. I still don't know what made me think this was okay. I think I was just so broken in every other area of my life that at the time, and I know this sounds horrible, I didn't even care if I accidentally cold the 58 year old father of three, whose children trusted me with his life. His family was in the waiting room praying, and I felt absolutely nothing looking at them. The surgery started around 7 a m. And by 9:30, I was already jonesing for another hit. I excused myself for a bathroom break and shot up in the stall. My hands stopped shaking and I went back in. Sarah, my head nurse who'd worked with me for 10 years, kept giving me these looks. During the pre op briefing. She'd asked if I was okay and mentioned I seemed off. I saw her exchange glances with the Anesthesiologist and my paranoia went through the roof. By 1 p m, I'd taken three more bathroom breaks to top off. Each time I came back, Sarah documented something in her notes. I dropped an instrument and blamed it on new gloves, but I could tell nobody was buying it. She suggested calling Doctor Chan to take over and I snapped at her, accusing her of undermining my authority. The whole OR went silent after that. Around three PM, I realized I was running low on supplies. I'd only brought enough for what I thought would get me through, but I've been using more than usual because of the stress. I started rushing through the procedure, trying to turn a 17 hour hour operation into 10. I skipped double checking suture lines and my hands were visibly shaking. While working on this man's heart. The anesthesiologist asked why I was rushing and I barked at him to mind his own job. I made an incision too deep and to compensate while Sarah quietly documented everything. The whole team was on edge and I'd created this hostile environment where everyone was afraid to speak up even though they knew something was seriously wrong. By five PM, I was in full withdrawal mode. 10 hours in and I'd burned through everything I had on me. My hands were trembling so bad I could barely hold the instruments. I was sweating through my scrubs, and my vision was getting blurry. All I could Think about was getting home to my stash. This man's chest was cracked open in front of me, and all I cared about was getting high. I started closing him up as fast as possible, just trying to get out of there. That's when everything went to hell. The patient started hemorrhaging badly during the chest closure. His blood pressure crashed, and alarms started screaming. The OR erupted into controlled chaos as everyone scrambled to save him, while I just stood there frozen for a second. I managed to find the bleeder, but the damage was already done. He needed a mask.

What happened? I taught my cousins a language that changed our lives forever. You see, my family had this rule about women and silence. A woman's voice was considered poison. After her 16th birthday, the silence ceremony happened at midnight. Your father holds you down while your mother sews a red thread across your lips. Not literally, but you wore that thread on your wrist as a reminder. Break the rule once, they'll lock you in the laundry room without food. Break it twice, they'll pull a tooth. Nobody broke it three times. Women's silence was like a currency. Whichever man had the quietest house was the most praised in society. At family gatherings, my uncles would compete like kids showing off baseball cards. Mira hasn't made a sound since January, Uncle Dev would boast, spreading his fingers in response. Uncle Raj would lean back, smirking. That's nothing. Priya is going on two years. When the doctor asked her a question at her check up, she just pointed at me to answer. It actually sounds crazy saying it out loud, but for so long, this is just the way things were. And I myself was the loudest person I knew. I couldn't even get through a conversation without laughing at something the other person said, even if it wasn't meant to be funny. I loved singing lyrics out loud and making weird sounds with my friends. So I knew if I didn't Find an answer soon, then my life would be over. But I wanted the problem to go away by itself. And one day, it did. I was sitting in seventh grade when Miss Brown told us that we needed to take a foreign language. My ears perked up because ASL, American Sign Language, counted. You see, the whole time, me and my family were in the USA. Because it wasn't until you turned 16 and made the vow of silence before you were sent back to the motherland. And there you were forced to settle down and have kids. So three times a week, I sat in Mister Brown's classroom learning to speak with my hands. Adrenaline pumped through my veins. If she so much as texted my parents about my choice of language, they'd find out what I was up to, and my life would be over. I even didn't know what I was going to do with the lessons because no one around me spoke the language. But then came Diwali dinner. All our relatives flew in from in the motherland to eat at our house. It was supposed to be the happiest time of the year. But during the meal, I noticed Priya sitting by herself at the end of the table. There were tears silently streaming down her face, and she was unable to tell anyone why. She was 17. A year into her silence, when no one was looking, I handed her a glass of Water. With a note in my hand. Meet me by the garden shed. Bring your sister. I told everyone that I noticed her sorry was wrinkled and I was going to teach her how to fold it properly in the shed. That's how it started. Every family gathering. While the men watched cricket and the silenced women served food, me and the younger girls would cluster together, all desperate to avoid our fate. I taught them letters first, then words. Then we had whole conversations flowing between our fingers. We got creative with practice locations, signing while washing dishes, our hands hidden in soapy water. We developed our own secret gesture. A flick of the wrist meant he's coming. A thumb brush meant save this conversation for later.

Growing up, my sister Brooke never let me forget I was adopted. While our parents showered us both with love, she'd whisper things like they only got you because the agency had a two for one sale. Or at least I know where I came from. I tried not to let it bother me, but every comment chipped away at my confidence. I was 8 when my parents chose me. They already had Brooke, who was 6 at the time, but they wanted another child. After seeing me at the agency, they said it felt like I was meant to be part of our family. But Brooke never accepted me. She'd hide my homework, blame me for things she broke, and tell other kids at school I was second hand goods.

Our parents noticed the difference, but didn't want to compare us. He praised both of us equally, even when Brooke clearly didn't deserve it. Everything changed during our senior year. Brooke was failing three classes and risked not graduating. Instead of studying, she spent her time making TikToks about how adopted kids were damaged goods and posting Instagram Stories mocking my generic brand DNA.

I had already been accepted to Princeton, and with a partial scholarship. But I hadn't told anyone yet. I decided to let Brooke dig her own grave. Every time she skipped class to hang out with her boyfriend, I kept quiet. When she forged our mom's signature on her failed math test, I looked the other way. I watched as she dug herself deeper and deeper. The day college decisions were released, our parents gathered

Well, there's other ways to be happy than butting into other People's lives. Okay, so you need to. You don't think about anybody but yourself, do you? Apparently not. I'm so sorry that I'm thinking about myself on my own proposal day that you just ruined cause you just had to button in on the surprise. Don't I? Don't I deserve to be happy too? You ever think about that? Yeah, sure. You deserve to be happy. Go propose to your girlfriend and. And propose every day for the rest of your life. You love it. It's not as fun, but get out of mine.

I've been wearing a prosthetic leg since I was 9 after bone cancer took my real one. By high school I'd gotten used to explaining it to new teachers, showing my medical documentation, and moving on. Most educators were understanding and supportive, but Mrs. Henderson, our long term substitute for AP Biology, was different from day one. She kept making comments about kids these days faking everything for special treatment and would stare at me whenever I use the elevator or took extra time transitioning between classes. I tried showing her my 5:04 plan and medical records, but she just rolled her eyes and muttered something about convenient paperwork. The breaking point came during a lab practical. I was working at my assigned station when she approached with this smug expression. She whispered that she dealt with attention seeking students before and that my little act wasn't fooling anyone. I explained again that my prosthetic was real, even offering to show her the attachment point, but she just smiled coldly. Prove it, then she said, loudly enough for nearby students to hear, if it's real, you won't mind me checking. Before I could react, she grabbed my prosthetic leg and yanked hard, trying to pull it off like it was some costume piece. The pain was excruciating as the socket twisted against my residual limb. I screamed and fell backward, knocking over lab equipment. As she continued pulling, convinced it would just pop off, the entire class stopped working. Several students started yelling at me.

I was lucky enough to have my daughter in my class when she reached eighth grade. But I also had a student named miles who just couldn't sit still. He constantly bugged the girls, always trying to flirt, and it usually ended with him getting slapped or sent to the office. I had sent him down so many times that the front desk basically expected him every day. Eventually, I moved him to the front of the room just so I could keep an eye on him. One day, he asked me if he could sit in the back. He didn't argue or act out. He just asked nicely. For some reason. I said, yes, we. We're in the middle of an assignment, and the entire room was quiet. That's when I heard whispering from the back. I looked up and saw miles showing something to another student. At first glance, it looked exactly like a handgun. Froze for a second. I didn't know if I was seeing it right. Maybe it was a toy or a prop. But I couldn't tell from where I was sitting. And I knew I needed to get a better look without making a scene. I got up to help a student near the back and use that chance to look again. This time I knew for sure it wasn't fake. It was real. I felt sweat drip down my face. My Hands were shaking while I quietly pulled out my phone under the desk. Tried to call 9 1 1, but the room was too quiet. I couldn't risk saying anything. I couldn't just leave the class, either. I had to keep everyone safe. And most of all, I needed to get my daughter out of there. I texted the assistant principal in all caps, telling him exactly what I had seen. Then I waited. I kept glancing at my daughter, trying to keep it together, but minutes passed and no response came. I knew I had to do something. I quietly called over one of the students I trusted and handed her a note I had written. It said, ask me to go to the bathroom. Find the assistant principal, show him this text. Tell him to check his phone and leave the building right away. She nodded and left without a word. I went back to my desk and acted like nothing was wrong. Five long minutes later, someone knocked on the door. The assistant principal walked in all and casual and started chatting with a couple students near the front. Then he looked at miles. Can I talk to you outside for a minute? Miles looked a little confused, but stood up as he walked past my daughter's desk. My

I'm not gonna be mad, whatever it is. I just, like, don't believe the reason he told me. So what was the reason he told you? He said we were moving too fast, and he needed to be by himself before we went too far. Okay, you don't think that's the reason? Oh, no, because he was the one who wanted to stay the night. And he was the one who, like, wanted to have sex. I mean, I did, too, but he was, like, the one who was initiating everything. Okay. And now do we still have Casanova Cody's phone number, correct? Yes. Okay, so just guessing here. If I had to guess, and this is gonna sound pretty harsh, but here's what I'm gonna say. It's either something you did or didn't do that night. Uh, or he's secretly married. Or maybe he's just a jerk who uses girls until he sleeps with them, and then he kind of throws you away, like so much used Kleenex. So either way, how about this? We'll call him. We will get a more accurate answer from him when we come back. Hello? Hi, can I speak to Cody, please? Uh, yeah. Can I ask who's calling? Uh, this is the Z Morning Zoo radio show. Nick, Ashley, and Shaggy on Z1O4. Oh, shit. You serious? Did I. Did I win something? Uh, not yet, no. Uh, but we are playing a little game this morning called Tell Us. The truth. And the only rule is you have to answer the question honestly. But it's only one question, okay? Oh, okay. Um. What's the question, Ashley? Okay, so a few weeks ago, you spent the night at this girl's house by the name of Sarah, and you guys were dating. And, you know, the next morning you left early. But then you never called. You never called back. You said you needed some time alone cause things were moving too fast, and we know that's not true. So, um, what is the real reason why you aren't talking to her? And remember, you have to answer honestly. Oh, man. Oh man, I. Yeah, I don't really know if I can answer this one for you guys. I'm sorry. Okay. Why not? Did something happen? Yeah. And, um, it's a bit embarrassing. It's like. There's like no way that I. I don't feel. It's. It's. It's really embarrassing. Okay, I understand. Now, what if we offered you some sort of prize to answer the question? Like. Like, what can we give you? Ah, jeez, I don't. I don't really know. Okay. Are there any concerts you want to go see? Maybe we can get you tickets to a. To a show. I mean, you know, Post Malone would be pretty cool. Okay, so you want to go see Post Malone? Yeah, I mean that. That would be pretty dope. Okay, so. Alright, so for Post Malone tickets, then you Gotta tell us what happened. Oh, my god. Um, she's not, like, listening right now, is she? She is not. She's not.

I tried to cheer her up with her favorite candies and watch movies with her, but you don't realize how many movies are centered around couples until you have to avoid them. I was there for her through all the heartache and listen to her vent. She asked me if I could talk to Anthony to get him to take her back. I told her that she had broken his heart and that I didn't think there was a way to come back from that. She cried day in and day out. After a while, she started crying less. She asked me how Todd and I were such a good couple and how he felt knowing about my past. I told her he still didn't know yet and wanted to tell him on my own terms. She said she didn't want what happened to her to happen to me and that I should tell him soon. I said it was my relationship and I would handle it my way. After third Wheeling our relationship for months, Laura moved back into her own apartment. She still visited a couple of times a week. She seemed happier when I saw her each time, and I could see that having some space was really helping her. I was glad at this. One evening, while at dinner, Todd told me he was glad to see Laura doing better and asked about Anthony. I told him that Anthony was managing, but I realized I hadn't talked to him in a while and said I would call him up the next day to see him. At the end of dinner, the waiter brought me a dessert, but I didn't order one. When I tried to explain that I didn't order a dessert, I saw in a chocolate sauce will you marry me? And when I looked back at Todd, he was already on one knee looking at me with charming eyes and a smile on his face. I nearly fainted. I felt butterflies in my stomach and shook my head. Yes. He put the ring on my finger and kissed me. I hugged him with tears in my eyes. Next day I called my brother Anthony and decided to meet him at his house to catch up. We talked about what was going on in our lives and he was super excited to hear that Todd was now my fiance. He told me that I was super lucky to find someone so genuine and loving, unlike his ex. I laughed and agreed. I told him that he dodged a bullet and if it wasn't for me he would be stuck with a liar. He said that his big sister always looked out for him and he was grateful for that. He said I was a genius for recording her while I was at the restaurant with her. And he probably would have been blinded by love if he hadn't heard it from the horse's mouth. We went out to eat and talked more about our lives. I was glad to see he was doing okay. Over the next few months, Todd and I were arranging our wedding. At first, I was hesitant to ask Laura if she wanted to help because her wedding had been canceled. But I thought that I had to since I was her best friend. She excitedly screamed yes when I asked her. I was glad that she was still down. We began looking for wedding decorations, a venue, and a cake. This was more exciting when it was your own wedding. I often daydreamed about me and Todd getting married, and it was coming faster than I expected. Laura and I went out for lunch one Saturday to the same restaurant we had gone to before. She said the food was so good, she had to get it again. When I arrived, she got me a gift. It was a cartoon drawing of me and Todd. It was one of those drawings that you get from the fair when you sit down and the guy draws you and your significant other with crazy proportions, like big heads and little bodies. The drawing of me had a huge mouth. I had to laugh. I asked her where did she get this from, since the fair hadn't been here for months, and she said, Knew a guy who sells them. They look so accurate, right? She laughed. I told her most definitely. She said we had to frame it and hang it right on top of the bed once we got married, and I said this would go somewhere, but I'm not sure exactly where yet. We both ordered the same meal we got last time, which was the grilled steak with garlic butter and the seafood paella. It was just as delicious as it was last time. Laura asked if I was nervous about the wedding, and I told her a bit because I hadn't told Todd about my past and hope that it wouldn't make that big of a difference. She said it shouldn't if he really loved me for me. I agreed with her, and we enjoyed the rest of our food and left. The wedding day arrived, and it was time for me to walk down the aisle. The soft music was playing, and I made Laura my maid of honor, just as she had to me. I was greeted with the smiling faces of our family and friends. I felt nervous, but I was happy. As the efficient was about to let us tell our vows, he asked if anyone objected. Voice from behind me said me, and I thought it was a joke at first, so I laughed. Then I turned around to see it was Laura. Then she said with a stern face, I'm serious. The crowd Gasped, and I asked her what she was doing. She said that she knew that I was the one who broke up her and Anthony's wedding. I stood in shock. She said she overheard me and Anthony's conversation in his house months ago, confessing that I recorded our conversation in the restaurant. I asked her what she was talking about, still denying the accusations. I felt my face turning red and sweat was forming under my arms. She said she bugged Anthony's house after the wedding Saturday. I wanted to see if there was another girl I had to worry about. But the only girl I had to worry about was you, my best friend. She screamed. She looked over at Todd, and he looked at me in disgust. She said that not only had she told Todd about my past, but Laura also said she'd been intimate with him for the past year. She said that this was their plan all along and that they would be together now. She ran over to grab Todd, kissed him in front of everyone, and said, if anyone is getting married today, it's gonna be me. The crowd gasped again, and there was a lot of commotion. I ran out crying. I just wanted to be alone at that point. Anthony ran after me to console me. In the dressing room. He hugged me as I cried into his arms. How could she? I said to him.

When my girlfriend slapped me across the face for the first time, it hurt a lot, but I thought it was just something all girlfriends did, so I just laughed it off and told her not to do it again. As other than that, she was my dream girl. Cook me homemade chicken Alfredo whenever I was sad. She was the first girl to ever get me flowers. And even six months into the relationship, when I paid for our meals together, she's just as grateful as she was on our first date. Plus, it wasn't until eight months into our relationship that a flip had switched, because it was around this time that she found out her dad had been cheating on her mom. It started off small. She'd grab my phone when I got texts just to check who it was. She'd get upset if I talked to my godmother about a book she wrote. You don't need to smile that much when you talk to her, she'd say about the cashier at target. Then came the accusations. If I was five minutes late from work, I was cheating. If I didn't answer her texts immediately, I was with another girl. She'd slap me playfully when other women walked by, but her nails would leave marks when I mentioned it hurt. She'd cry about how I didn't understand what she was going through with her family falling apart. Then came the night where Stella pushed me off the balcony. Luckily, I lived on the first floor of my apartment building. I was just left with two broken ribs and a dislocated shoulder. When I went to the hospital, I told all the nurses that I had just played too much basketball, and the other people in my life were already really suspicious of. So I didn't tell them either. But no matter how much she cried to the doctors or posted about how proud she was of me, there was one woman who wasn't buying into her BS. And that woman was my stepmom. She showed up at my apartment the next day with groceries and her laptop. I'm starting a YouTube channel. She announced home organization and cleaning tips. Very Marie condo meets suburban mom. I thought she lost her mind. She was a tax attorney who could barely operate the TV remote. She sort of gilded me into being her co host using the I pushed you out of me card. And she set up cameras all around my apartment. The bathroom, the kitchen, even my bedroom. At the time, she claimed it was so our audience could get the full experience. The genius part. Stella thought it was pathetic. Some desperate stepmom trying to bond with me through a silly project. She'd mock the videos, call my stepmom cringe, but she never saw her as a threat. Just another stupid woman in my life. During filming, my stepmom would forget To turn off her phone that was recording voice memos for content ideas. She'd schedule emergency reshoots whenever she noticed fresh bruises, making sure to get them on camera. While pretending to film my hands organizing drawer dividers. I had no idea that the whole time, she was just documenting everything. We were three weeks into our channel when Stella lost it. We saw a comment from a woman saying, I had nice hands in our drawer organization video. The camera caught Stella attacking me with a kitchen knife, screaming about how I was just like her father, and how she'd make sure no woman ever looked at me again. When I tried to escape, she cornered me, saying she'd tell everyone I abused her if I ever left. That's when my stepmom walked back in, claiming she'd forgotten her lap.

I was always the dumb, ugly, fat friend, and I wouldn't have it any other way. In high school, my best friend not only got all the guys she wanted, but all the girls, too. She was just that pretty blonde hair that didn't move, smelled like Miss Dior, had a nice butt. So when me and Jasmine would go to the library together and guys would only talk to me to try and get to her, I was happy for her. And when her Snapchat was filled with open snaps from hot guys, while mine just had Team Snapchat and my mom, I was happy for her. Not because she didn't rub it in my face. She did. And not because she didn't see herself as better than me, she absolutely did. But because if I had to pick one of us to be the ugly friend, I would choose me every time. Because even though Jasmine could be a bit of a pick me, deep down I knew she had a soft heart, so she needed the world to be kinder to her more than I did. There was just one thing that made me sad. I knew that she would overly rely on her looks to get her through life. And when high school ended, my theory was already proven right because I graduated with a 4.2 GPA. While the only reason Jasmine didn't flunk out Is because the creepy guidance counselor took a liking to her and convinced all the teachers to grade her tests more kindly. I was actually surprised when she spent all summer working, because with the way the world treated her, making her own money was definitely an optional thing. But when I visited her at her job, I realized her version of working was much, much different from mine. She got hired at the trendy boutique downtown where the manager took one look at her and said she'd be perfect for their brand image. Meanwhile, I spent my summer doing data entry at my dad's friend's accounting firm. Mind numbing work that no one would ever call me perfect for. And the more we talked, the more it became obvious to me that we started to see the world very, very differently. It got to the point where I even had to distance myself from her. I started getting all of my updates about her life from her Instagram instead of our usual Facetimes or texts. In just six months, she had gone from 3,000 followers to 200,000, with her comment sections being filled with thirsty amen. She was getting free clothes from expensive brands, invited to brand events, flown to Coachella. But I knew that most of her new friends were probably using her to make themselves look better, so I always made sure to leave wholesome comments under her posts. I sent her gift packages of stuff I knew she loved on her birthday because I always wanted her to know that someone out there me loved her for who she was, not just for her clout. Honestly, I thought I'd never see her again. Until one day when I was 28. I was a well established lawyer, had my own place, and a boyfriend that loved every inch of me unconditionally. And I guess all the milestones reminded me of when I had graduated from high school. Because one day I found myself reaching out to Jasmine again. I mainly just wanted to see if she had changed and if we could be friends. Cause even though I had met some amazing new people, nothing beats someone from your past. We agreed to meet at the usual ice cream place we'd always spend our pocket money on during high school. When I saw her, it took everything in me to hide the shock I felt because her face was pumped with Botox lip filler, not to mention a pound of makeup. After we got through the awkwardly high pitched how are yous? I cut to the chase. Well, kinda. I casually asked if she was working right now. Um, well, you see, I was, but I just smiled because I had an ace up my sleeve. And that ace was a job offer. I told her I was looking for a secretary and I was willing to pay $65,000 a year with benefits. What do I Look like to you an effing charity case? I stared at her blankly and she threw her plastic filled head back and cackled like it was the funniest thing known to mankind. It had been almost 10 years. There's no way she was still like this. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and continued, yeah, so you would have to start ASAP. But, um, she interrupted, don't you know I'm an influencer? She then took out her iPhone and showed me her page. I was gaining a new follower once every four months, and all her DMs were from three years ago. That's when I finally realized Jasmine wasn't some misunderstood pretty girl. She was the washed up, textbook definition of I peaked in high school. I was about to walk away, but she stopped me. Hey, don't be sad. With an A that flat, I would be a lawyer too. I tried to make a B line to my car, but she literally ran in front of me and continued, hey, so when do I get to meet your boyfriend?

Uh, yeah, can I speak to Christine, please? This is Christine. May I ask who's calling? Uh, hi. Uh, my name is Catherine, and I'm a friend of Linda. Um, I'm calling because I heard that you got to go on a cruise recently that my husband was on. Oh, hey. Yeah, yeah. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm just fine. Yeah, that was. That was a really fun cruise. Okay, um, so, listen, I. I know this is gonna sound kind of sneaky, but I was actually wondering if you could help me answer a question. Um, did you happen to notice if my husband was staying with anybody on that cruise? Like, did he have a companion? Um, I mean, I mean, that's. Well, I mean, that's kind of the point. Everybody sort of does on those things, you know? I mean, yeah, but what I'm trying to figure out is why he chose to go without me if other people were allowed to bring their spouses. Okay, well, okay, I guess that's something you're gonna have to ask him, because, I mean, I've seen people come single or in couples to these things. I mean, technically, the rule is it's for, like, couples only, so. So, I don't know. I mean, you're supposed to come as a couple. You know what I'm saying? That's what. That's what I thought. Yeah, but he told me it was a work cruise and that it's only Paid for the employees to come in if they can't bring their families. Okay, yeah. He told you it was a work cruise? Yeah. Okay, well, I'm. He's lying to you. I'm sorry. I mean, I hate to say that I don't want to call your husband a liar, but it wasn't. It wasn't a work cruise. I mean, it was a Bliss cruise. A what? It was a Bliss Cruise. It's like. Have you ever heard of a Bliss Cruise? No. Okay, so it's like. Okay, Bliss Cruise. It's like. Oh, god. I'm gonna, like, just hang up and let you Google it, okay? And you can. You can figure it out. Okay? I'm not trying to be rude, but I don't want to go all into it. Okay, so wait, what is it. What is it called again? It's bliss B L I S S. Okay, so that's. That's the cruise we were on with your husband and you. I don't know. I mean, you. You should probably have a conversation with him about this. Uh, okay. Um, thank you for your information. Yeah, sure. I mean, no problem. Good luck. Uh, okay, hang on a second. Captain. Uh, I'm. Ashley's already googling. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Are you ready for this gay cruise? No. Okay. Okay. Bliss Cruises. We offer 5 star cruises for adults only, catering specifically to the swinger lifestyle. With clothing optional ports of call and amenities for those Who embrace alternative marriage lifestyle. So it's a swingers cruise? Oh, my god. I can't believe. I can't believe this. I mean, I guess. Oh, my god. I guess I knew that there were, like, adults only cruises and gay cruises and Backstreet Boys cruises, but I didn't know that there were swinger cruises. Yep, and that lady was right to. It says for couples only, so. I mean, maybe Jason went with someone else, but whoever it was, I mean, they had to have wanted to be a swinger, too. Catherine, is there any chance that that morning meeting your husband is in? Is probably over yet?

I've been wearing a prosthetic leg since I was nine after bone cancer took my real one. By high school, I'd gotten used to explaining it to new teachers, showing my medical documentation, and moving on. Most educators were understanding and supportive, but Mrs. Henderson, our long term substitute for A P. Biology, was different from day one. She kept making comments about kids these days faking everything for special treatment, and would stare at me whenever I use the elevator or took extra time transitioning between classes. I tried showing her my 5:04 plan and medical records, but she just rolled her eyes and muttered something about convenient paperwork. The breaking point came during a lab practical. I was working at my assigned station when she approached with this smug expression. She whispered that she'd dealt with attention seeking students before and that my little act wasn't fooling anyone. I explained again that my prosthetic was real, even offering to show her the attachment point, but she just smiled coldly. Prove it, then, she said, loudly enough for nearby students to hear. If it's real, you won't mind me checking. Before I could react, she grabbed my prosthetic leg and yanked hard, trying to pull it off like it was some costume piece. Pain was excruciating as the socket twisted against my residual limb. I screamed and fell backward, knocking over lab Equipment. As she continued pulling, convinced it would just pop off, the entire class stopped working. Several students started yelling.

Tara is on the phone, and she doesn't know why her coworker named Josh doesn't want to go out with her again, because according to her, her date was magical. Oh, they were set up by friends at their office, and then they went to happy hour. Happy hour turned into dinner. Dinner turned into a music shop where he showed her that he knows how to play the drums. Yeah, and then that turned into a food truck, and then something else turned into something else, and then there was another thing turning into another thing. Anyway, they hung out for, like, 10 hours before they finally made out on her porch when he walked her home. And then since then, he said that he's doing great when she's talked to him at the office, but he hasn't asked her to hang out again, and she's wondering why, and she can't think of anything that could have gone wrong. Hello? Hey, is this Josh? Yeah. Hey, man, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. I'm calling you today because we do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. That's where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up not calling them back after, they can email us to get you on the phone and Ask why. And we recently got an email about you. About me? Okay. Okay. And they say they had a great time, but they also say it seems like you don't want to go out with them again. And they're wondering why. I didn't do anything wrong. Do you want to know who it is? We're not saying you did anything wrong. She's. She's trying to figure out what she did wrong. Who is it? Her name is Tara. Okay. And you guys work in the same office? Yeah, it's true. Okay. And Tara emailed us, and then we talked to her a little bit about your date. She said that you guys had a great time, and you were even making plans to go out again, but it seems like you don't want to go out with her again. I didn't say that. But, uh, we had a good time. Yeah. So is she misinterpreting that? Cause she said that you canceled the plans, and when she tried to say, okay, so when should we reschedule for then she just didn't hear anything back from you. She told you that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, uh, that's kind of weird. I would say. Uh, things changed and I didn't call her back. That's all. Okay, what changed? I don't even know how to explain it. The thing between me and Tara is so confusing. I don't even know how to explain this to you at all. Okay, well, can you Really? Can you try? Uh, yeah, I can try. First, I'll tell you what she told us, and then you can tell us your side of the story. She said you were set up through co workers. You guys went to happy hour, and that turned into, like, a 10 hour event where you did all sorts of things and hung out for quite a while, and then you made out, and she's seen you around the office since and even asked, like, how you were doing, and you said things were great, but you kind of, like, cancelled a date on her, and then now you're just not really seeming interested. Is that the truth? Partly. Um, all I know is this. We went on a date, uh, we kissed, and she's telling everyone in the office we did a whole lot more than that. What do you mean? I guess that she was talking to a bunch of ladies in the office and really bragging about how good I was in bed. Wait, but you guys didn't hook up? No. No. That's weird, because she didn't tell us that you hooked up. She said you guys ended the night with a really good kiss. And that's true. We had a really good kiss. Okay, okay. But to the people in your office, she told them that you guys hooked up? Yeah. And that you were good, it sounds like. I guess so. I wasn't there for it, but That's what's happening. Are you sure that it's not just, like, a miscommunication through the gossip chain? You know, like, maybe she said you had a great make out session, and then someone else added to that, and by the time it got back to you, it's like they hold you guys were boning or something. I don't know what she said, but whatever she said has gotten the whole office into a tizzy. I'm getting so much female attention, I don't know what to do with it. Really? Wait, wait. What do you mean? So other. Other. Your female attention? Like, other chicks in your office want to go out with you? Yeah, more than one. In fact, I've already gone out with one of them and did some of the. The things she said we did with the other girl. Whoa. So you're getting a bunch of action from your office mates because of her lying or saying something about you guys going out? She's like, you're weird. Oh, my god. Yeah. You know for sure that she was lying? What if this girl that you hooked up with was setting the whole thing up so she could get in your pants? You're right. I don't know. All I can say is dozens of women are eyeing me every single day. Ever since whatever Tara said, it's been snowballing. Okay. Oh, my god. Well, aren't you curious to find out what she said? I mean, a little bit. But in another sense, I really don't care because things are going so well for me right now. Alright, well. Oh, dude, I'd like to know and. And I think we should ask her because. Josh, Tara's on the other line listening to this conversation and wants to talk to you. Oh my god! What? What? Tara's on the other line listening and wants to talk to you.

In middle school, I was the meanest girl in our class. Not the popular kind of mean that everyone sees in movies, but the quiet, sneaky kind. I wrote a burn book before Mean Girls made it famous. It was just a pink notebook where I wrote awful things about everyone. Their secrets, their looks, their families. Things I heard in the bathroom or made up when I was bored. My best friend Emma and I would sit at lunch, whispering and laughing while writing in it. We thought we were so cool and smart. No one knew about our book except us. Or so we thought. One day in eighth great, Emma and I had a huge fight over a boy named Tyler. She stopped talking to me, but I kept a burn book. I wrote terrible things about her, too. How her dad lost his job. How she still slept with a nightlight. How her clothes were from Walmart. Stupid kids. Stuff that felt huge back then. When high school started, I made new friends and forgot all about that book. I grew up, realized how awful I'd been, and tried to be better. By college, those mean girl days felt like a different lifetime. I became a teacher, moved to a new city, and built a good life. I never thought about that burn book or those mean days. Ten years later, I was teaching fourth Grade at an elementary school in Chicago. I love my job, my students, and my classroom with its rainbow rug and book corner. I was the teacher I wished I'd had as a kid. Parent teacher conferences came around in October. Over. I sat at my little desk, meeting parents one by one, talking about their kids progress. The door opened for my last meeting of the night, and a woman walked in with a familiar face. My stomach dropped. It was Emma, my old best friend. The one whose secrets I wrote in that burn book. She smiled tightly and sat down. Miss Parker, nice to see you again. I tried to stay calm. Emma, wow. Is Lily your daughter? Lily was one of my quietest students, always reading in the corner. Emma nodded. Yes. Strange coincidence, right? When Lily mentioned her teacher's name, I wasn't sure it was you until I saw the school photo. We talked about Lily's reading skills and math progress. Everything felt normal, but weird. Like we were both pretending. As Emma gathered her papers to leave, I couldn't take it anymore. I'm sorry. I blurted out for everything back then. The things I wrote. I was awful. Emma paused. You know, I found that book after our fight. I took it from your backpack. I read every word. My face burned hot. I'm so sorry. I was terrible person. Yes, you were, she said quietly. I cried for weeks. I waited for her. To yell or say she'd tell the principal about my past. Instead, she pulled out her phone and showed me a picture. It was the burn book. Sitting in a metal trash can, burning. I kept it all these years, not sure what I'd do if I ever saw you again. Then Lily came home, talking about her amazing teacher who makes everyone feel special. Who stands up for the quiet kids, who taught them about bullying. I realized you weren't that girl anymore. She put her phone away. People change. I burned it last night. It's over. The next day, Emma brought cupcakes for the class. As she helped pass them out, she whispered, Lily needs a good teacher. Be that for her. Now. Emma and I get coffee sometimes while Lily reads nearby. We never talk about the Burn Book.

One day, my daughter came back from school and ran into my arms like she was scared. I could feel her shaking, so I took her inside and made some French toast, which was her favorite food. I thought she just had a really bad day and missed being at home, but I couldn't have been more wrong. When she calmed down, she told me, Mommy, something happened today, and I think I'm supposed to tell you about it. An uneasy knot formed itself in my heart when she told me that the school counselor had called her into his office for a special game. He handed my daughter a stuffed unicorn and told her that this new game was very popular with the children, which made my daughter excited and eager to learn. Then the counselor made her point the unicorn between his legs and push on it repeatedly. My daughter told me how he made weird faces at times and then closed his eyes and leaned back. Towards the end, I was so horrified and felt a wave of nausea rush through my body, so I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. What kind of sick person would make a seven year old girl do this kind of thing? Not to mention he worked at a school and it was me who willfully sent my daughter near his vicinity. I kept bouncing between Blaming myself and wanting to burn the entire world. My husband was no longer with us, so it was up to me to stand up for my daughter. I don't know what made me approach the school administration before the police, but that's exactly what I did. And the school administration laughed at me, saying that my daughter was clearly playing a prank. They said they had heard other students make similar jokes about the school counselor and said that parents should teach their kids not to lie. But by the time I made it to the police station, the school had already called them and explained the situation. They thought I was a crazy mother who was trying to give merit to my daughter's filthy lie. I had looked straight into my daughter's eyes when she told me the story, so I knew she was telling the truth. But no one wanted to believe me, and I felt like I was in a nightmare. This is when I remembered something important and ran back home to open my jewelry safe. Inside there was a note that I hadn't looked at for a long time. See, although I was currently a doctor, I had been a very inexperienced nurse at one point. And one time, a very stern looking man with a lot of face tattoos walked into our hospital with a bullet wound. No other nurse wanted to treat him since he looked so scary, so they sent me I convinced myself that everyone deserves treatment and cleaned his wounds with the utmost concentration. I even engaged him in conversation and joked about how he should stay away from bullets in the future. When it was all over, the guy thanked me and handed me a note with his phone number on it. Said, if you ever need someone taken care of, I won't ask for any payment. I typed in that phone number and to my surprise, it actually connected. I told him who I was and he said, I remember you.

Hi, everyone, I'm Sarah Miller, and my daughter Tiffany just transferred here today. The chat lit up with a string of welcomes and hellos. Just as I was about to type out my own greeting, a huge block of text appeared. Important notice from Tiffany's mom. Girls in the class, please take note. Starting next week, I'll be posting a picture of what my daughter is wearing each day. Please make sure your child doesn't wear the same thing. Also, I request that everyone please switch to the same brand of laundry detergent we use. My daughter has a very sensitive nose and can't tolerate other scents. Finally, my daughter was a C section baby and is a bit timid, so I ask you to tell your children not to bully her and make sure she's always treated with priority. Wow. I couldn't help but think, this isn't just a new student. This is a royal princess who's slumming it with us commoners. Some of the moms in the chat were quick to push back. Karen's mom are you serious? What my kid wears is none of your business. Why should we have to cater to you? Jessica's mom exactly. And we're supposed to all use your detergent? My son has allergies, too, and we use specific stuff. Yeah, who made your kid the queen of the class? My kid is special, too! The chat Quickly devolved into a debate. Usually I just chuckled at the ridiculous things these parents said in the group chat. The class teacher was the administrator, and she'd usually step in to calm things down. I didn't see a problem, so I just muted the chat to get some work done. Then I got a DM. It was from Alyssa, whose daughter Emily was friends with Lily. Hey, Sarah, you got a
