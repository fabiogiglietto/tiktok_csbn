She tried to give herself a cute haircut. Unfortunately, she wasn't good at cutting hair. She ended up cutting off way more than she intended. She tried to glue the hair back on, but the glue didn't work. She found Dexter, who started mocking her when he saw the mess. Deedee asked Dexter for help and kept praising him. Dexter plucked one of her hairs to study it. Eventually, he concocted a potion to help her hair grow back. Before giving her the formula, Dexter carefully explained how to use it, warning her of the consequences if she ignored his instructions. But as usual, Deedee didn't listen. She nearly emptied the entire bottle in one go. As expected, the result was a disaster. Her hair began growing uncontrollably fast. She immediately ran into Dexter's lab. Seeing this, stir tied her hair back. But Deedee's hair kept growing. To fix the problem, Dexter decided to create an antidote. He sneaked up behind dad and removed his wig. Dad was naturally bald. Then he collected some of Dad's dandruff. Dad found him. He immediately left. The situation was getting worse. He had to develop an antidote immediately. While Dexter worked on the new formula, he seemed unable to succeed. Deedee's hair grew thicker and thicker, completely taking over the lab. Despite the enormous challenge, Dexter didn't give up. Deedee was completely engulfed in hair. Once the formula was ready, he pushed through the thick Tangle and start trimming. Then he sprayed the potion. He trimmed and sprayed simultaneously. Finally, he succeeded in applying the potion to Deedee's hair. The hair slowly began to disappear and everything returned to normal. However, unexpectedly, the bottle of hair growth potion fell into his father's hands, causing disaster once again.

Jasper and I have been best friends since college. We met freshman year, bonded over terrible dining hall food and all nighters and never looked back. When we both got jobs in the city after graduation, moving in together was a no brainer. That was three years ago. He's the best roommate I've ever had. Makes coffee every morning, splits chores without being asked, watches my favourite trashy reality shows with me even though he pretends to hate them. We're not romantic, never have been, never will be. Jasper is gay, has been out since high school. I'm straight. We're basically siblings who chose each other. Our apartment reflects it. His sneakers by the door, my plan covering every surface. Inside, jokes written on post it stuck to the fridge. Everyone who knows us knows we're just roommates, just friends. That Tuesday morning, I drove him to the airport for his sister's wedding in San Francisco, five days away. We grabbed coffee, sat at his gate laughing about his mom's terrible dance moves from last year's rehearsal dinner. When they called his boarding group, he stood up and I pulled him into a hug, normal goodbye hug, the kind we've done a thousand times before. That's when I heard someone screaming. A girl was running toward us, blonde hair flying, face twisted with rage. Jasper pulled back from the hug and his face went Completely white. The girl was there in seconds, right in our space, breathing hard, staring at me like she wanted to kill me. I knew it, she said. I knew there was someone else. Jasper stepped back. Celeste, you need to leave. My stomach dropped. This was the girl he'd mentioned months ago, the one from his old tinder profile back before he fully came out almost two years ago. He'd gone on one date with her while he was still figuring himself out, then realized he couldn't keep pretending. He told her he wasn't interested and blocked her when she wouldn't stop texting. She ignored him and pulled out her phone, started showing me her screen. Jasper's Instagram photos of us at brunch last weekend, at a concert two months ago, a selfie we took in our apartment. You're all over his page, she said. Her voice was shaking. Every single post, you're always with him. People were starting to stare. A few moved away from us. Jasper's hands were trembling. Those are just pictures with my roommate, my friend, roommate. She laughed, but it sounded wrong, broken.
