Nope. Hot day too. What else she didn't wind up? The hose. And worst of all, going to bed without my headgear, even though the orthodontist totally recommends I wear it at night, but I don't care. Whatever. The car, Axel. We're not talking about the car. No, my paper's in the car. My final paper I need to turn in to pass my stupid summer school class. Axel. Are you kidding? I ate unwashed fruit. Well, I'm not helping. No, I'm not gonna help. Go get it even if somebody asks me. Wait, come back. As sue watched the family take off, she realized that whether she joined us or not, no one would notice. The only way she was gonna get our attention was to disappear. Uh, my name is Sue Heck. Has anyone tried to find me yet? No, I don't think so. Are you lost? Well, no, not yet, but probably soon if you guys are home. Um, this is sue and I'm still at the fair. So. Hi. We lost something very important. Her son's English paper. It was in one of the cars they hauled away to the dump. We tried to chase it down, but we couldn't catch it. And then we went to the demolition Derby arena, but they told us to come here. I need that paper. I can't take junior English a third time. I just can't. I'm just an hourly hire. Sorry, sue, we're all tired from running around, but this is no time to sit. Let's go. I don't believe this. I always remember where I parked. I hope you guys are deducting points for this. I think it was near a white van. Sue, do you remember? Oh, I'm sorry. Were you talking to me? I'm tired and emotionally trained. Where's the car? I don't know. Sue was talking a lot when we parked. How's it going, dad? Oh, yeah. Really? Well, at least I got a car to drive home in. Oh, like you never accidentally driven your car into a demolition Derby before. No. You know what, Axel? I haven't. God, you've been so grumpy all day. Gee, I wonder if there's a reason why. I don't know what you want me to say. I'll save up for a new car. This isn't about the car, Axel. This is about you. Of course it is. Do you realize that if you would have gotten hurt, you could have kissed your football scholarship goodbye? You're gonna stop being smart. I try, but it's not that easy. Well, I'm tired of being smart for you. This is your entire future here and you're playing games with your report card. You're almost getting killed. You're 18. It's time for you to start doing the thinking. I always think I'm very responsible. You don't know how lucky you are to have a scholarship. I'd kill to play ball in college. He Doesn't care. He has no respect for people or produce. Oh, that was not my fault. Are you blaming mom for dragging us here in the first place? Hey, me, your non favorite was fine with you watching t V all summer. He's the one that wanted you off it. I would have preferred t V to come in here. You're the one that wanted this. I was just trying to give it to you. Oh, no, no, this has nothing to do with this. The only reason we're here is cause you wanted to suck up to brick. That's right. I know all about the 20 points. Well, I'm done with summer. But this was supposed to be the summer of sue and Dad. Sue, enough already. I love you, damn it. I shouldn't have to say it.

Does the Long Beach Board of Ed agree that these books should just sit here and not be used at all? Let me explain. It's called site based instruction. It means that I and the principal each have the authority to make These kinds of decisions without having to go to the board, who have bigger problems to solve. Do you understand how it works now? Sorry. I didn't mean to overstep your authority. I would never do that. I just. I don't know how to make them interested in reading with these. You can't make someone want an education.

The zombie took the camera, first, opened the lens cap, then steadily aimed at the target and raised the camera. Seeing this scene, everyone present was shocked, so the doctor decided to conduct more complex tests. He prepared a puzzle toy for the zombie. When the doctor signaled that it could start, the zombie looked very happy. It carefully observed the shapes and put the puzzle pieces into the corresponding grooves one by one. Just when the scientists thought the experiment was successful, the zombie suddenly became extremely violent. It broke free from the handcuffs and lunged at the scientists. The doctor was so frightened that he immediately ran away. Quickly closed the iron door, trapping the other two scientists inside. He could only watch helplessly as the two were

Dr. Kevin, this is Jennifer. What are you doing here? Did you track my phone again? Yes, I tracked your phone again. Mom, that is so invasive. I pay for the phone, I get to know where it is. Same goes for you. It's the middle of the school day. Why are you even tracking me right now? Well, you're not in school, are you? This is not what we do, Jenny. Hi, Jenny, I'm Dr. Robbins. Um, I hear that you're having a little abdominal pain, um, and Dr. Robbins is an abdominal doctor, so, um, we're gonna take Jenny up to CT to get a closer look, and we'll let you know as soon as we get the results, alright? Are we Sort of obligated to tell the mother she's pregnant. I mean, if the kids in danger. Legally, we're obligated not to unless the patient gives us permission. For my kid, I'd want us to break that law. Oh, Warren, what do you see here? Blood in the lesser sac. Is that an aneurysm? Yep. Splenic artery aneurysm. What are the risks? If it bursts, it could cause an instant massive hemorrhage. The patient and the baby both could bleed to death. Now, can we tell the mother? Yes.

You ruined her life. We are. Going to sue you. Stop. Lori can hear you. It was my mistake. You weren't even in the room. My mistake was leaving you two in there alone.

Sure, it depends. You're under arrest. Arrest? For what? Aiding and abetting a fugitive, obstruction of justice and conspiracy to. Way to defend it to avoid prosecution. You just described anyone who's ever given money to Tom Delay. Oh, please put your hands behind your back. Do I have to? It makes me feel so pretentious. Alan, please don't joke. They don't look funny. You have the right to remain silent. Must you? I'll wave. Reading. I'll get you a lawyer. Sandy Crane for the defense. Glad to be back, judge. What's going on here? Last week he was in here defending you. Yes, judge. He gets me off, I get him off. We're flamingos. Don't ask, don't tell. Silence! Your honor, they've already started making a farce out of this matter. You made the farce by bringing the charges. Silence! Mister Shaw, you are the defendant. I don't want to hear another poop out of you. How do you plead? Not guilty, by reason of the district attorney's insanity. Alright, then we'll schedule. That's not a real plea. Not guilty, then. Do you wish a trial? If it's not too much trouble. Speedy. The Commonwealth stands ready, your honor. Bail? I asked to be released on my own recognizance. I assure you I will not flee. No objection. Fine. R O R. Is granted. We'll resume at 10:00 tomorrow. Adjourned. Your honor, at this time, the defense moves directed verdict of not guilty. The prosecution Has failed to make a case. Denied. Fine. Then we'd like to call our first witness. Ladies and gentlemen, A D A. Douglas Cooper. You can't call him. It's not unprecedented, your honor. Especially when defense goes to bias. The only reason I'm on trial. I'll judge you sustained. Mister Shaw, the court instructed you not to poop. Sidebar, Judge. The only reason I'm on trial is him. I should be allowed to cross examine him on motive. My courtroom will not be turned into a sideshow. I told you, your honor, I have no problem testifying. In fact, since Mr. Shore rang the bias bell in front of the jury, I'd appreciate the chance to refute the attack. It is highly unorthodox, yes, but as Mr. Shore pointed out, not unprecedented. Your honor. Let's just do this. Let the, uh, defendant take his shot. Conspiracy to aid a defendant to avoid prosecution. Isn't that a defense lawyer's job? Within the bounds of the law. Okay, but certainly if I were to advise a client, do not tell the police the truth, that would be okay. But if you advise him to lie, it would not. And you took it a step further. You advised your client to jump bail, to flee the jurisdiction. No, I told him it was his only option. Same thing. No, but come on. If the client comes to me and says, G, as I look at things, seems my only real shot at avoiding Prison is to run. And it happens to be true. I have a legal obligation to lie to my client. To disagree? No. And yet, if I agree, I've committed a crime. If that agreement can be construed as advising him to flee, yes, it's a crime. And by the way, your client didn't come to you and lay it all out. You laid it out to him, which crosses the line. I expressly told him I was not allowed to advise him to flee while conveying to him all the while that that is exactly what he should do. But I'm a Kidder. You know that. I offered you $10,000 to drop this, did I not? Yes. As either a transparent attempt to entrap me or a demented plan to have me recused. The point is, you didn't take me seriously. But you claim I was serious with Mr. M. Cabba. You seem to know this beyond all reasonable doubt, in fact, which, given you weren't even there. Do you think that you're fooling anybody? Do you? Mr. Cooper, this is a personal grudge. No, it isn't. However much it might be coming. Chiber. Chiber! Did you not say in Judge Thompson's courtroom two weeks ago that you would like to see me suffer? No. You said your only fear was that someone would stab me before you would get the chance to take me down. Is it your testimony to this jury that you do not hold a Grudge against me? It's my testimony that that grudge is not in play. It's not in play? No, it is not. Admittedly, I do not like you. It makes me happy to be prosecuted. You despise me. Alright, tell us why. Oh, you would love for me to tell you why. That would be grounds for a mistrial. No, my grudge makes this prosecution a little more thrilling. But you're on trial because you broke the law. Objection. Calls for a legal ruling. You advised a client accused of attempted murder to flee. That's a crime. Objection. Perhaps you'd like to take the stand now, put your character in issue. My client trusted me to tell him the truth, which trust I honored. That's my character, Mr. Gooper.

This strange feeling made Lisa unable to resist grasping the sheet tightly. However, when Lisa woke up from her sleep but found there was nothing around, Lisa had no idea she was living in a cursed house. Locked in the basement was an ancient demon. The demon would turn into a wisp of pale smoke. He forced the women in the house to play horrific games. Lisa's grandmother was a professional exorcist. She realized the demon had defiled Lisa. Grandma grabbed her sacred relics and headed to the basement. A gust of evil wind suddenly shattered her relics. She rushed back to the cabinet for another sacred item. Filled with anger, she charged toward the basement entrance again. The moment she stepped inside, the door slammed shut behind her because Lisa was worried about her grandma. So she followed quietly as well. But when she opened the door, she didn't see her grandma. Only the sacred item lay on the cold floor. And she noticed strange symbols carved into the wall. From deep within the symbols came faint cries of agony. Curiosity drew Lisa closer to the wall. Unexpectedly, in the next second, suddenly, several hands emerged from the wall, firmly grasped Lisa.

After the body was burned, Ivan noticed a high heel shoe lying nearby. It was the birthday gift he'd given his daughter just yesterday. The mob boss sensed something was off, tossed the shoe into the fire, and, like always, told Ivan that the thing burning was a terrible criminal. But Ivan knew something didn't feel right. He rushed to the clothing store where his daughter worked. But her best friend coldly told him she'd stolen money and ran off with her lover. Alarmed, even hurried to his daughter's apartment. But no one was there. As soon as he stepped inside, he spotted the other high heel. That's when Ivan realized the body in the fire was his own daughter. He couldn't understand why the mob boss was his friend. Why would he kill his daughter so cruelly? Furious, Ivan pulled out his old military uniform. This retired major, once a war hero, decided to take justice into his own hands. Ivan had been a fierce fighter, but was forced to retire after an injury. And because he was from a minority group, he had always faced discrimination. The mob boss had been his war buddy. But after retirement, he'd gone deep into crime and often used Ivan's furnace to burn bodies, always telling him they were dangerous criminals. Knowing Ivan liked writing novels, the boss even brought Him paper to keep him sweet. But Ivan never expected that his friend's daughter would be the one to destroy his own family.

Soon, the two ended up in bed together. Meanwhile, Matt came home, glanced through the window and caught sight of his girlfriend with another man. When the woman finally returned, she found Matt dead. Convinced his death was her fault, she grew withdrawn. After his funeral, the photographer, however, disappeared. One day, she spotted a poster for his upcoming exhibition and decided to go. When the photographer saw her, he looked shocked. On stage, he thanked his other half. She assumed he meant her until her female neighbor appeared. Then photos of her and Matt filled the screen. That's when she realized everything had been a twisted experiment planned by the neighbor couple. Horrified, she fled. After the show, the photographer and his partner found a bottle of wine waiting outside. As they drank, the woman lured them with cryptic notes sent through a printer. They followed the trail to an abandoned building only to pass out. When they woke up, they were strapped to an operating table. The woman made sure the eyes they once used to spy on others paid the ultimate price.

So, you've probably seen that viral video of a Mexican model screaming, claiming that she's seen people eating people, right? Well, guys, this is way darker than it is. Part 1, the incident back in 2009, a woman identified as Gabriela Rico Humenes ran into a luxury hotel in Monterrey, Mexico, freaking out. She claimed that certain people were doing horrible things behind closed doors. Now, this line is what went viral. She claimed they ate a person, which absolutely horrified the internet. She looked terrified, like if she had seen something that she wasn't supposed to see. Part 2, the theories. The video was buried for years until it popped up again in 2024. And people freaked out because they claim that she exposed elite cannibalism like secret cult parties and other secret societies. The creepy part is that no one could confirm what happened to her after that day. Some people believe that she vanished. Others think she went into custody. And others think she just disappeared from the face of the earth, which is a suspicious right? Till this day, there's nothing about her. You can't find her anywhere.

A boy passing by saw the woman's panicked expression. He wanted to help her open the window, but the woman refused. The boy was confused. As he stepped out. Outside, he saw a maid working nearby. He accidentally touched the maid's butt, saying he just wanted to know how big her hips were. To his surprise, the maid cooperated, unexpectedly lifting her skirt without even looking back. And just like that, on an otherwise ordinary afternoon, Jack experienced his first transformation in life. From that moment on, he became bold, older. One day, he saw the maid carrying things and went up to help as they passed through the doorway. The entrance was too narrow, so he took the opportunity to lean his head against the maid. The maid didn't resist. Then Jack pushed the maid down, saying he just wanted to know how many layers her skirt had. Seeing through Jack's intentions, the may generously removed her clothes and gave in to him. After these two experiences, Jack started imitating other men's actions. He trapped another maid who had just delivered food to him against the door. From then on, every maid in the manor knew him. Every night they would line up outside Jack's room to chat. After some time, the women in the manor mysteriously became pregnant. They all went to marry their partners, and that was when Jack knew it was time to leave his happy Life was coming to an end.

He's talking like, very robotic, like, as if he's pretending to be a person. But the way he turns his head at us, you ever see it? Like a predatory bird. His head's on a swivel. It just. It just turns. I see him do that from the corner of my eye. Again, weird. He looks like a wholesome old man, and then he looks at me and he goes, hello, young man. Reaches his hand out, what's your name? He's already giving me weird vibes. I lie about my name, my Name is David. His hand still reached out, and I'm like, it's a bit odd. I reach out and I shake his hand. This man's hand, it was massive. Not just adult, massive. Evolved. My hand, like. The thing that freaked me out is that it was soft, like a baby's hand. It was so soft. And he didn't squeeze, he did it really lightly.

Brad, I was born with this kinetic cerebral palsy. It was caused by lack of oxygen to the brain at birth. This left me with problems controlling my speech, movement and posture. So right now, you'll notice that Brad's legs are moving, his arm there in the back is moving, and his mouth is also opening and closing. So these movements are most of the time totally involuntary. So Brad's not actually thinking about doing them. However, Brad does have limited control over each muscle. So, for example, if he wants to keep his mouth closed, if he wants to give somebody a high five, and he can also dish out a pretty good kick when he wants to. Cognitively, I am not affected. Thanks to a system of technology like my eye tracker here, I can get my thoughts out and showcase my personality to the world. That's right. Brad is highly intelligent and he has a great sense of humor that also has a college degree. And we run this business together and make all our decisions together

Let me tell you about it. We weren't like one of your super teams where you get the best players in the state to play on the same team. We were all just dudes from San Diego. First up, we got my guy JL. This dude is always been a freak athlete. In high school, he played DB and receiver and then when he got to Boise State, he was a free safety. If you wanna know how this dude plays, just go ahead and read this quote here. He's a scary dude, but he's also a great dude and very fun to be around, very funny dude. Anyways, now he's actually declared for the NFL draft and I'm super excited to see where he ends up going. Next up, we got my buddy Don Chapman. Don was just another freak out of high school. He played all over the fields and he was always making some sort of crazy highlight on local news. Don was a DV, had tons of offers and ended up going to UNC. He's been a big contributor for this team on defense and he's also just got great energy. Another guy who's really good to be around. Something about those San Diego guys, you know. Next we got my guy Jordan Allen, who is actually the son of six time Pro Bowler Eric Allen. This guy was a beast and also a very humble and Cool guy. It was just nice being around him. He plays linebacker at San Jose State now. And there's more dudes. Let me know if you want a part two.

He quickly called out to his superior and together they moved the stove aside. When the superior lifted the floor tiles, there was actually a dug tunnel underneath. The superior immediately summoned soldiers to surround the cell. The prisoners outside became nervous when they saw the tunnel was exposed. However, when night fell, they continued digging in the tunnel. It turned out that from the beginning of their plan, they had prepared two options. At another tunnel entrance, they had prepared a square floor tile. Then they lifted the manhole cover. This tile could fit perfectly inside. When working, they would lift the tile and someone would always stand guard at the entrance during the entire process. Once a patrolling guard walked by, they would immediately signal, throw the tools into the pit, cover it with the tile, then seal all the gaps around the edges, finally, cover it with the manhole cover and pour a bucket of water over it. This didn't affect the sewers function at all. Even if a patrolling guard stood right there, they would never imagine that beneath the sewer was the tunnel entrance. The entrance by the stove was actually just a decoy. As they were about to reach their target location with the digging, they began preparing everything they would need for the escape, since most of them were wearing military uniforms when captured, escaping directly like this. Definitely wouldn't work. Used bed sheets and old military uniforms to create a large number of civilian clothes to disguise themselves after escaping. Next, the most important thing was forging travel permits for after their escape. A prisoner pretended to befriend a guard, secretly slipping him gifts, but actually taking the opportunity to steal his wallet. Using the guards travel permit, they forged permits for everyone. With everyone working together, they successfully completed the tunnel on schedule. With all preparations ready, the escape would happen at midnight. Everyone dressed properly and lined up to enter the tunnel one by one. As long as their comrades at the front broke through to the surface, they could successfully leave this place. But what no one expected was that when they broke through to the surface, they just.

Then he noticed the diamond given to the chubbiest champion next door. It was much bigger. His eyes lit up with greed. He dragged me over to compete against her. But my opponent was overwhelmingly strong. The moment she stepped onto the platform, I was flung off instantly. The match was over in seconds, and I was eliminated. I blamed my husband for sucking away all my fat, leaving me no chance. But his mind was already spinning a new scheme. He stuffed my pockets with rocks. So much weight that I could barely move. Somehow, that leveled the playing field. I scraped through the round. Next was the first challenge. Tying balloons to our bodies without being lifted off the ground. My opponent had no trouble at all. My feet were anchored under heavy stones my husband placed. Just as she began to gloat, he secretly strapped a rocket to her back. This round was easily won by me, too. The second round tested body elasticity. It looked terrifying. I tried to back out, but my husband pulled me forward. He set up a trampoline under my clothes, covered it with fabric. So even when a team of little dwarfs bounced on me, I stayed Put and passed.

When I saw it was still peeking, I flew into a rage. But as I moved to strike, it swiftly slid into a sewer drain. Helpless, I had to let it go. Yet the moment I stepped inside, creep emerged again from the drain. With a loutish chuckle, he blew hard into his own shoulder, his body instantly puffing up into a sleazy middle aged man. After stretching a bit, he immediately eyed a woman sipping coffee nearby. He blew a sharp gust away, making her shiver instantly. Then he pulled out his own valve, transforming into a scarf and draping himself over her shoulders. Both felt a very different kind of warmth witnessing this, I nearly panicked and warned her, that's a creep in disguise. Terrified, she flung him off. As the man prepared to blow himself up again, I quickly grabbed a fork and popped him like a balloon, deflated instantly. No amount of blowing could reinflate him. Now defeated, he could only watch as we rolled him up, taped a $1 for sale sign on him and put him on the curb. Soon, a strangely dressed elderly woman passed by.

Then he deliberately threw a dollar Bill on the ground for me to pick up. So he kept throwing bills and I kept picking them up. He lured me right into his mansion. Holy crap, this guy was loaded. Even the armor was made of gold. Just then, the rich guy handed me a gluing diamond dress and told me to change in the bathroom. I excitedly rushed in, took off my pigeon costume, threw it all aside, removed all my disguises, then put on the dress. While dreaming about rich wife life. I noticed my dark circles, immediately covered them with dollar bills. Then I lifted my arms. Couldn't let my arm the hair scare the rich guy. Used a gold card to shave it off. I was shaking with excitement. Would never have to protect and to be a pigeon again. Couldn't help laughing out loud. Then I looked at my leg hair. After some thought, grabbed a nearby candle, dripped wax on my legs, stuck two dollar bills on it, then ripped hard. The hair was gone. Hurts so good my legs instantly became smooth as Jade. Did the same thing to my right leg. So damn satisfying. I was so excited I Could fly. Looking at my gorgeous face, my heart filled with anticipation. Just then, I spotted gold bricks on the counter. I stuffed them all into my hair. Now my head was worth millions. Then I removed my dollar Bill face mask, washed my face and dried it with nearby fur. But accidentally triggered a mechanism. The wall suddenly opened. Trembling, I walked over and discovered there was actually a skeleton.

Years ago, he had felt too lonely, so he turned Mary into one of the night clan. But as time went by, Mary completely transformed into a terrifying monster that made him grow sick of her existence, because now he had fallen for a human girl named Anna. Meanwhile, Mary wanted to know what she looked like, so she went to the town's painter, Mike, and asked him to make a portrait of her. But when Mike tried to paint her face, something strange happened. His mind suddenly went blank, and his hand holding the brush wouldn't stop shaking. It frustrated him because he was just one step away from finishing the portrait. Mary then walked up to the painting and saw the empty, faceless space. She immediately lifted Mike and set him on top of the cabinet, telling him to calm down. Mike was terrified by the move, broke into a cold sweat, realizing what she really Was and thought about escaping, but Mary was already blocking the doorway, demanding that he continue painting her portrait. Mike had no choice but to obey. Mary even warned him that if he didn't finish within five minutes, she would drain every drop of liquid from his body. With no other option, Mike blindfolded himself and tried to paint purely by feeling. When he finally opened his eyes and saw the finished portrait, he was stunned. Mary also looked at the painting and was captivated by the beautiful face. But what she didn't know was that the portrait Mike painted was not of her. It was of the human girl Anna.

But the danger wasn't over. If this continued, his strength would soon run out. Worse still, the massive pulling force had snapped the safety rope connecting the skateboard. By now, no matter how strong Jimmy's arms were, he could no longer stop the skateboard from sliding backward. Watching death draw closer and closer, Jimmy directly jammed the screwdriver into the fuel tank to use as a handhold. With his other hand, he grabbed an iron frame on the chassis. This finally freed his entire body from the skateboard. Passengers on the bus quickly opened the floor and pulled Jimmy up together, but this wasn't the time. To celebrate, yet the fuel tank had been punctured and was now leaking continuously. In less than 10 minutes, the bus would stop and everyone would be killed in the explosion. Since they couldn't defuse the bomb, the police brought in a flatbed truck to drive alongside the bus, hoping to rescue the passengers this way. Only the first passenger was lucky. When it was the second passenger's turn, the bomber suddenly triggered a bomb under the door. The step was instantly blown open with a hole and the woman fell from the bus and lost her life. Jimmy felt very guilty about this, but it also made him realize there must be a surveillance camera installed in the bus. That's how the bomber knew their every move. Sure enough, after some searching, he found a pinhole camera lens in a corner above the door. After learning this, captain quickly had the radio station intercept transmission signals in the area and replaced them with footage of the current bus, then loop it, they hoped to fool the bomber. In reality, they had already started the rescue operation. With the efforts of the police and Jimmy, all passengers were soon transferred to the bus on the other side. The bomber didn't notice anything unusual. Now only the driver and Jimmy remained on the bus. To escape alive, Jimmy used a metal rod to hold down the gas pedal, then tied one end of a rope to the steering wheel and the Other end to an iron plate. Then they lay on the iron plate and escaped from under the bus. The bus changed its direction due to the rope's pulling force, and finally crashed into an abandoned airplane and exploded.

She had mistaken pain relieving morphine for an antibiotic. And what scared her even more was that she had injected 100 mg instead of the required 3. And a high purity drug like this only needs 5 mg to be fatal. The old man even tried to comfort her and told her not to panic, because as long as the antidote was given within 10 minutes, it would be metabolized and removed from the body. Then he took out his notebook, thinking this was a very interesting way to kill someone. But the girl panicked even more because the antidote that should have been in the medical kit had mysteriously disappeared. The old man also noticed her worry. After all, someone as wealthy as him usually lived in a manner far from the city. Even if they called for help now, by the time medical staff arrived, it would be too late. It seemed tonight was destined to be a death trap. He knew someone wanted to kill him using her hands so they could pin the blame on the nurse. The girl still held onto a sliver of hope and grabbed the phone. But the old man suddenly hung it up. He told the nurse to listen carefully to every word he was about to say, because only then could she clear herself of suspicion. The the old man didn't want her family to fall apart because of him. If The police suspected the nurse. Her mother's illegal immigration status would also be exposed. The old man told her to make noise when going downstairs and not to forget to say hi to his youngest son at the door, and it was exactly midnight at the time. Then she drove out of the manor. Once she was out of the surveillance zone, the old man told her to park the car on the roadside, then returned through the backyard gate because the family dog knew her and wouldn't bark. But to avoid everyone's sight, she had to climb up to the third floor using the lattice fence outside the wall, but she accidentally broke one of the bars. When she came back, the old man told her to put on his pajamas and hat. He knew his youngest son smoked at this time every night and successfully made him think it was his father. This way she had a witness, which was enough to clear her from being the prime suspect. But the girl had one fatal flaw she would throw up whenever she lied. The old man told her not to lie, then she could tell only part of the truth. Then the girl went back the same way, but as soon as she came down, she ran into the family's great grandmother. Luckily, the old woman had bad eyesight and mistook the girl for her great grandson and asked why he came back again under the cover of Darkness. The girl finally returned home, but the next day, when the butler opened the door, he saw the old man's throat was slit and a bloody knife lay on the floor. Because the old man was a famous mystery novelist, his death quickly made the news. Police initially ruled it a suicide, but the girl still lived in fear every day. Then one day she received a call saying the old man had already been buried. But police still needed to ask everyone some questions, so they wanted the girl to return to the manor early for work. The story began to reach its peak and by the end, it would definitely fry your CPU. The old man's eldest daughter was a self made

Oh! Let me go! Oh! What was that? Then something strange happened. My eyes had been blind for 30 years, but now I can finally see it again. And the very first thing I saw filled me with rage. My wife kissed my own brother. To take revenge on them, I decided to keep pretending I was blind. Soon, my wife walked over. Not knowing the truth. She told me she would take me to the best hospital for treatment. But I never expected her to be this cruel. The doctor told me what really happened. An hour earlier, Emma had stormed into his office and throw down a stack of cash. I thought she was asking about my condition. But all she wanted was to make sure I stayed blind forever. The doctor refused her. His conscience would not allow it. He told me everything. He also saw my vision was returning and that Emma had betrayed me. He felt pity for me and decided to help me get my revenge. I am so sorry. What's wrong? Situation is getting worse. I need to register a guardian. I'm sorry that I become a burden to you. Come on, bro. No, honey. No, no, no, no! Come here. No! Yet my wife still pretended to comfort me. But I knew deep down she was overjoyed. When we got home, I overheard them plotting to take all of my wealth. The next day, Emma lied and Said I needed to sign an important document, but it was actually a contract to transfer my estate to bribe. My assistant pissed off the stack of money inside the file and handed it to the man I trusted most. But when he saw the money, he betrayed me, telling me the contract was fine. I was devastated, finally realizing everyone around me was only there for the money. But I had already made my plan. I signed the paper without hesitation, and when they were ready to celebrate, I took off my glasses. And the worst decision of yours.

My heart is ruptured. I need emergency surgery. But my mother, the hospital director, calls every available doctor to my brother's room. He only has a few scrapes, yet she orders a full body scan for him while I lie there bleeding out. I beg her to help me, but she snaps, visibly annoyed. Can't you stop fighting for attention for once? You're brother almost injured a bone. In the end, I die on the operating table. But after the news of my death breaks, my mother, who has always hated me, completely, loses her mind. In the final three minutes of my life, my soul drifted to my mother's side. She was sitting beside my younger brother Felix Goodman's hospital bed, her face filled with worry as she prayed. Felix, please don't scare me like this. Wake up, okay? My father stood nearby, his face twisted in fury. If Sean had done his job and protected him, Felix wouldn't be in this state. Just wait. I'm going to beat him to death. I stood and watched at the side, bitterness rising in my chest. Dad, there's no need for that. I'm almost dead. Not that you guys would care. At that moment, the doctors were gathered around Felix's bed in a circle. After confirming that his injuries were only scrapes and nothing major, one of the older doctors finally dared to bring me up. He asked cautiously, Miss Blanchard, are You sure we shouldn't check on Sean? His injuries from the car crash seem very serious. Mom's gentle expression instantly turned into one of disgust as she roared, what's he trying to pull now? Playing dead? Doesn't he realize what he's done to his brother? I stared at her, stunned. Though my heart had already stopped, it's still somehow throbbed with pain. I was their son, too. Did they really not care about me at all? Suddenly mom picked up her phone and dialed my number. A nurse brought the phone to my ear, and instead of hearing the concern I had hoped for, all I heard was contempt on Goodman. When are you going to crawl out of bed and apologize to your brother? My heart instantly turned cold as whatever hope I had left withered away. Of course, she never cared about me. Come to think of it, when I was first brought into the hospital, I had begged mom to save me. But all she said was, do you have to fight for attention, even at a time like this? Don't you realize that your brother nearly broke a bone? Then she turned and walked away without a second glance, taking the entire medical team with her to tend to Felix. Could she have the capacity to love me? The nurse, unable to bear it any longer, took the phone and said, Miss Blanchard, Sean can't hang on much longer. But mom, still convinced that I was Faking it, let out a mocking laugh. How much did that brat pay you to act along with him? I can't believe he's capable of something like this. Just as she finished speaking, Felix, who had been acting unconscious the whole time, finally woke up. He faked a weak voice and asked, Mom, Dad, how's Sean? As mom looked at the obedient, considerate Felix lying on the bed, her expression twisted into even deeper contempt. Sean, why can't you be more like your brother? He's hurt because of you, and yet he's still worried about you. If you don't get here in the next three minutes to apologize, don't bother ever showing your face to me again. She then hung up, her chest heaving with anger. Dad, standing beside her, looked clearly displeased. Why bother calling him? Isn't it enough that he nearly got Felix killed? Felix lowered his head, trying to hide the smug look in his eyes. He put on a guilty expression before looking up at them. Mom, dad, don't be mad at him. Sean has just never forgiven me for getting the overseas scholarship instead of him. I understand why he hates me. I couldn't help but laugh. Even in my death, Felix was still trying to sow discord between me and my parents. However, my parents would never see through him. In their eyes, he would always be the better son, and they would never think about the true reason to the car accident. Just As expected, Mom's face immediately turned cold. What's the point of sending someone that selfish to study abroad? Who knows how twisted he'd become after being abroad? Felix gently said. Mom, don't be angry. I'm sure Sean has his reasons. Mom's expression immediately softened. Felix, you're too kind. That's why Sean keeps taking advantage of you. That was always Felix's strength, knowing exactly what to say to win our parents hearts. I knew that even if I stood right in front of them and told them all of Felix's cruel behavior over the years, only slap me across the face and accuse me of making things up, saying that I was just jealous of him. After all these years, I had gotten used to it. In the middle of their conversation, my older sister, Ashley Goodman, burst into the room. Her footsteps were hurried as she anxiously rushed to check on Felix. The moment she heard about the accident, she immediately flew in from another state without a second thought. And just like my parents, she only cared about Felix once she confirmed he was okay. Ashley let out a sigh of relief before fuming. I've always said that Sean is a curse to our family. Ever since Felix was born, he's been hurting him again and again. Felix took the opportunity to act pitiful. Don't be angry, ash. I'm sure Sean didn't mean to hurt me. The whole family burst into an uproar upon hearing this. Dad slammed the Table. What? He actually caused the car accident to hurt you? Mom clenched her teeth. That bastard! I'll make him pay! The look in Ashley's eyes was venomous as she wished she could rip me into pieces. Felix flinched as though he realized things had gone too far and they might start questioning the story. He hurriedly said to them, please don't be mad at Sean, okay? Maybe I remembered it wrong. No matter what, he's still my brother. He wouldn't do something like that. Ashley gently tapped his forehead. You're just too naive. You have no idea how evil some people can be. At this point, mom chimed in, it's truly a blessing to have a son like you. Alright, I'll listen to you. Let's forget about that ungrateful brat and focus on getting you well again. The warm, golden light of the setting sun spilled across Felix's hospital bed. Watching the four of them together, a happy, United family, I felt an indescribable ache in my chest. In that moment, I realized how out of place my soul truly was. It was as if I wasn't one of them at all. Like I was just a stray dog that wandered into their home. I wanted to leave, but my spirit was bound tightly to Mom's side. I couldn't speak. I could only watch and endure their contempt in silence. Few days later, under the family's meticulous care, Felix was discharged from the hospital. Mom was busy packing his Things. While dad had already parked the car right outside the hospital door, afraid Felix might have to walk even a single extra step. And Ashley wouldn't even let him put on his shoes by himself on the way home, mom muttered irritably, Sean is really something else. He didn't even visit his brother at the hospital even once, let alone apologize. I'm going to teach him a lesson once we get home. Dad glanced at mom and said coldly, I told you keeping him at home was asking for trouble. Sooner or later, something bad was bound to happen. Hearing the words teach him a lesson left me feeling a complicated mix of emotions. Long buried memories came flooding back into my mind. Since I was young, mom had always favored Felix. I was expected to always give into him. It was all because on the day Felix was born, I had accidentally spilled water, causing mom to slip and go into premature labor. The sight of him lying in the incubator broke my entire family's hearts. Dad had smacked me so hard that my eardrum burst. You're a jinx! You're. Her brother nearly died on the day he was born because of you! Lying weakly in the hospital bed, mom had looked at me with eyes full of disappointment. Then, in elementary school, dad had beaten me so badly that I couldn't get out of bed for three days. Just because I fought with Felix over a toy. Car! It was my favorite toy. Even though what had come as a freebie along with the gift dad bought for Felix during a business trip, it had become my most cherished possession. But Felix, who already had boxes full of toy cars, insisted on fighting me for that one. In the tug of war, he suddenly screamed and burst into tears. Mom rushed over distressed and hugged him while crying and yelling at me. Sean Goodman, your brother has already suffered so much because of you. What more do you want from him? It wasn't me! Before I could even explain, Felix squeezed out a few tears and said, mom, don't be angry. It was my fault. I shouldn't have made trouble by fighting with Sean over a toy. When dad got home and saw that scene, he immediately pulled me aside and started beating me. A cold hearted kid like you doesn't deserve to stay in this house. Keep you here is just waiting for a disaster to happen. I cried and begged him to stop, but the more I cried, the more convinced dad was that I was faking it and the harder he hit. Mom and Ashley just stood at a distance, watching coldly. It was as if I was their enemy and they wouldn't be satisfied until dad beat me to death. From that day on, whenever I made Felix cry, it would mean receiving scoldings or beatings from my parents. Eventually, I stopped fighting Felix, for their love, stopped trying to explain and stop trying to get close. And now they left me cold and lifeless on the operating table. As soon as they got home, Felix sloped onto the couch. The moment he said he was hungry, Ashley eagerly went into the kitchen, excited to show off her new found cooking skills. Normally too delicate to cook, she was now scrolling through her phone for nutritious meal plans. Afraid of causing Felix to have an upset stomach, dad presented him with the latest luxury gaming console, saying it was a welcome home gift to celebrate his cheating death. Mom had already cleaned Felix's room thoroughly and filled it with air purifying plants, saying that fresh air was good for his recovery. Felix simply lounged on the couch and played games. Yet that was enough to tug at the heartstrings of the entire family. Meanwhile, my soul was trailing quietly behind them. This house, once so familiar, now felt ice cold. Suddenly, the door bell rang. Standing at the door with someone I knew all too well, my girlfriend, Caitlin Winter. She stepped inside and immediately fussed over Felix's condition. Mr. And Mrs. Goodman, I heard Felix was discharged today. I brought some supplements for him. Felix instantly dropped the game controller, putting on a shy smile. Caitlin, you didn't have to. I'm already feeling much better. Caitlin flashed him a sweet smile. Usually cold and aloof with me, she was now gentle and Caring with Felix, I watched her, an unfamiliar feeling rising in my chest. Suddenly she asked, where's Sean? If she hadn't brought me up, I doubt anyone would have even remembered I existed. When my name was mentioned, Mom's face darkened. Why are you bringing up that ungrateful brat? After I scolded him the other day, he didn't even bother coming home. It's just as well. Since he likes staying out so much, he can stay away forever. The house feels peaceful without him causing trouble every day. Caitlin quickly nodded. It's better if he doesn't come back. Don't want him disturbing Felix's rest. Ashley walked out, holding some supplements and said playfully, so, have you decided when to break up with Sean? If you don't move fast, someone else might snatch Felix away. Caitlin lowered her head shyly. I was actually planning to talk to Felix about it today. A stinging sensation welled up in my throat. I let out a self mocking laugh and turned away, not wanting to watch any longer. I had long grown used to the feeling of being unloved anyway. After dinner, mom grew irritable for some reason. She returned to her room alone and began searching through her phone. I walked over to look. She was looking for my number, calling it again and again, but of course there was no answer. Eventually she slammed her phone down in frustration. You won't even answer my calls now? Do you think anyone actually cares? About you. I wanted to tell her I'm dead. There's no way for me to answer your call. But then she called the nurse from the hospital. Did Sean tell you what kind of stunt he's trying to pull? Tell him to stop being so shameless and come back to apologize to his brother. Then maybe I'll consider letting him come home. There was a brief silence on the other end before the reply came. Miss Blanchard, Sean passed away a week ago. His heart was ruptured in the car accident. But you had called all the doctors to Felix's room, so there was no one left to operate on him.

And any young man interested in my daughter needs to explain to me the purpose of the relationship. The purpose. It ain't like I'mma take advantage of a 15 year old girl. Oh, I agree. If you like to get to know us better, you're welcome to join us for lunch on Sunday. We'd be happy to have you. How'd you get that bruise on your face? That's none of your business. She let Jake make her own decision. I do not like that boy. He is very disrespectful. How can we be respectful when daddy just runs them off like that? If he shows no respect for us, then he won't respect you either, baby. You've got to trust us. That boy has a lot of growing up to do. Come on, Jay. Let's go to the table. I'm not hungry. Well, I still like for you to sit with us, daddy. This place is nice. Isn't it expensive? Jade, I brought you here because I want to tell you how grateful I am that God gave you to me. I see my daughter becoming a beautiful young woman and I can understand how any young man be drawn to you. They want to win your heart, but they don't know how to treasure it. I would also like for you to know that as your father, I want the very, very best for you. So I like to make an agreement with you. Okay, Jade, if you'll trust me with your heart and allow me to approve any young man that desires to have more than the friendship with you, I promise to take care of you and give you my full blessing. Okay? I have something to help us to remember this night. This is meant to be worn until it's replaced by your wedding ring. Jade, I love you, sweetie. Daddy, thank you so much. I love you, too.

Thirty two year old Kenneth White was driving his van on the interstate when suddenly a seven pound rock flew down from an overpass, striking white in the head and chest. Father of four died instantly. The perpetrators were four teenagers aged between 15 and seventeen. In court they yelled and danced around thinking they'd soon be released because of their young age. When their defense lawyer tried to convince the judge to prosecute them as juveniles, the judge firmly denied the request, saying the proposal for a juvenile sentencing is rejected. Plaus erupted from the victim's family. Now these teenagers will be tried as adults facing potential life sentences. Do you support the judge's decision? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

Like, no, we didn't see a clown. It's night time. And he's like, alright, consider heading home soon. I'm getting some weird calls. He didn't seem too concerned. We get, we get a call to go to one of his other kids house. There's a lot of trees so like on the side streets it's kind of dark. We're like a half block away from the school. Like we take the left and we take the right and there's a clown standing in the middle of the street. You know, you kind of go, dear in headlights. He twists something in his hand and it's a hatchet, you know, an axe. Like if it's facing you like this, it just looks thin. Like you can't really see it. It just looks like a handle. Then when he spins it, you could see the whole thing. I know. We all see the weapon. He starts sprinting. He starts sprinting right at us. The breath leaves all of us. You know, we take off, bro. Book it back to the school. Let's be real. We torture this guy like he's not fast. He gets it back to Edinburgh. We jump the fence and we stand in the middle of the field so we have a 360 view of the field. And we're just waiting there for a few minutes. Just wait, just wait, just wait. He just pops out fence and stares at us. We're like, dude, we do not know what to do. Cop turns the corner, sirens on and chases him down. Thank God that's the end of him for the night. So why did you guys call the cops? We were running from a man with a hatchet.

She can't even speak. She's in an absolute psychosis. When she finds out what happened, the husband comes home. The brother comes home. The brother was the one that found the baby. The only thing that gets this woman out of the psychosis. It's like a fringe.

Very hard workers, but also just fun dudes to be around. Good guys. I'm a little bit biased, I thought there was never a color combo that was better than white and red. We got some nice gear at Stanford. I also got to keep my black and red helmet, but I ended up giving that one to my dad as a gift. Anyways. Don't mind the lightsaber. Here is my red Jersey and this thing is awesome. I always dreamed of playing in this nice and clean, you know, bench warmer and with my name on the back. I'm definitely gonna get this framed at some point, but I don't really have room in my dorm for it right now, so. But this thing is so clean man. The only thing is it's so small and this is like a medium. These things had to be skin tight when you warm. It was wild. Anyways, here's my white Jersey. This thing is equally clean. It just looks so awesome. Like I said, the white and red is just a beautiful combo. And then again, got my name and number on the back. Awesome! I really can't wait to get these things framed man. It's gonna be. It's gonna look amazing.

Annie crawled to the living room with all her strength, hoping the camera on the cabinet could capture it. Her husband quickly dragged her back inside. But when her husband finished venting his anger, she took out a gift from her bag and threw it in front of Annie, who was already pregnant. Her husband then asked what fruit she wanted to eat. Annie quietly said she wanted to eat fruit. The man immediately took out money and handed it to Annie, telling her to go buy it herself. But he couldn't have imagined that Annie, who came to the supermarket, not only didn't buy strawberries, but actually bought a tub of ice cream that pregnant women can't eat. Then she sat alone on the street corner until late at night. Only when she confirmed her husband was asleep would she come to the bathroom to eat ice cream. The next day, Annie went to work. But before it was time to get off work, she received a phone call from her husband urging her to come out quickly. Annie could only leave early. Before getting in the car, she secretly turned on her phone's recording. But as soon as Annie got in the car, her husband complained she was moving too slowly. Facing the scolding, Annie chose silence. But When she secretly placed her phone beside her, she noticed the navigation destination was an unfamiliar place.

Using a delivery truck as temporary cover, Jackie seized the brief opening to slip away unseen. The thugs crawled across the ground, searching, yet still failed to track them down. Just as the pursuers were about to give up and sweep another area, Jackie caught the gaze of one of them through the rearview mirror. Reacting instantly, he yanked open the canvas hood, slamming the thug against the side of the truck. They turned and tried to escape quietly, only to run straight into another enemy lurking around the corner. Jackie handed over his pistol to divert the attacker's attention, though the weapon was completely empty. More reinforcements arrived, forcing them to flee again until they hit a dead end. He lifted the reporter onto the top of an iron gate, then squeezed himself through the bars at the very last moment, finally shaking the mob, at least for now. After rescuing this complete stranger, he simply nodded goodbye and the two parted ways. But the thugs climbed over the gate, still determined to hunt Jackie down. I don't even know her, he muttered. Meanwhile, they assumed the boy nearby was absorbed in his video game.

This time he is hunting a killer, the man people call the Wolf King. The Wolf King once raised a group of children and trained them in every skill he mastered. Ten years later, those children have become highly capable operatives. Each one developed a unique specialty. Some became masters of disguise, others experts in altering their appearance and some could even switch genders flawlessly. Behind them stands a formidable tech support team with the Wolf King pulling the strings from the shadows, making their entire operation almost unstoppable. Ordinary officers don't stand a chance against them. But this time they ran into him. After picking up the Wolf King's trail, he assigned a female officer to tail the target. Her cover looked natural enough at first. At the moment they crossed paths, she had already been exposed. Fortunately, he noticed everything in time. Just as the elevator doors were closing, he rushed in and prevented a disaster. When the elevator reached the top floor, the Wolf King didn't walk away immediately. He continued watching them from afar and to avoid blowing the entire mission to satisfy.

Her abdomen distended like a giant barrel. The fetus within had developed into a 12 year old, mature enough to communicate through the womb. Delicate hands gliding across her taut skin. She still resisted childbirth, awaiting her husband's homecoming. When first pregnant, he was conscripted for war. To ensure the Newborn's first glimpse would be their father, he left Lucy a jar of labor delaying herbs. Lucy consumed one daily, forcing the gestation to persist 13 years. Now, with herbs exhausted and provisions depleted, she dragged her enormous belly outdoors, seeking nourishment for the developing child. Fortunately, spotting a stray cat nearby, though nauseated by the prospect, she lifted a hammer. After feeding the fetus accelerated growth, excruciating pain drove Lucy to seek herbs, but the jar held only remnants. The child, confined for 13 years, chose to force delivery. Lucy pleaded for delay, but the daughter's patience had expired. She terminated her mother without hesitation. Too large for conventional birth, she tore through membranes inch by inch, finally slithering into the vacant maternal skin, electing an apparent entrance to existence. The girl slit the stretched abdomen, discharged all fleshy matter, then settled in the rocking chair with a tranquil smile.

In the blink of an eye, her entire face had transformed. The man was strapped to an execution platform, a thousand pound axe hanging above his waist. As water poured into the device, the blade descended little by little. If nothing interfered, he would be cut in half within moments. At the brink of death, he suddenly noticed several severed heads placed above the mechanism. Wild idea flashed through his mind and he made a desperate choice. He lifted his leg with all his strength and hurled his shoe toward the mechanism. The throw missed. The axe was now less than a centimeter from his torso. Forcing himself to stay calm, he yanked off his other shoe, held his breath and threw it with everything he had. This time the hit was perfect. The impact triggered a chain reaction. An iron bar dropped, striking the giant axe. The blade slammed into the wooden plank that held the severed heads, tilting it, the heads rolled into the water tank below. He wasn't acting randomly. He was using the hair from the heads to clog the drain and stop the water flow. But sealing it completely required precious seconds and the blade was moments away from splitting him in two. At the final instant, the hair finally blocked the drain, freeing him from certain death. Right then, a cleaning woman suddenly burst into the room.

Her mother pride opened her jaw, detected the egg odor and slap. Modesta masked her sorrow with foolish grinning. The older sister with down syndrome received all maternal devotion. One afternoon, Modesta noticed the pristine white lace dress on bedding, curiously unwrapped the package, but her mother snatched it away, scolded her for staining the new garment with unclean hands. The mother continued berating indoors. Outside, Modesta released emotions in the down for unaware her mother had restrained her, taking the sister to a dance. This ultimately brought major family turmoil. Modesta waited long without maternal return. Then arrived an intoxicated man, her father, usually absent for months, returning penniless, always viciously demanding money from mother. This time he was severely drunk, embraced Modesta while slandering his wife. Just then, mother and sister entered. Mother, enraged, knowing his nature, ordered him to release Modesta and depart. They argued intensely. The disabled sister shielded mother. Modesta believed father supported her. But after father locked mother and sister in storage, Modesta realized he deserved no paternal title, hearing her mother weep.

After taking off her coat, she tightly pulls her hair into a high ponytail, then makes herself vomit violently. By the time she stands up again, figure has shrunk to 1% of its former size. Her boyfriend is obsessed with this unusual ability of hers, but constantly makes unreasonable demands, leaving Anna deeply frustrated. To make things worse, he shows up with a new lover and boasts about her unique trait. The girl actually has a long tail. Whenever it's revealed, her close friends grow restless, eager to benefit from exploiting it. Just then, Anna storms in, witnessing the tailed girl's true nature in private. Devastated, Anna starts eating wildly. A terrifying transformation follows. Her body swells to 100 times its original size, leaving Lisa nearby completely stunned. As it turns out, Lisa also has a hidden power. Every time she uses the toilet, a stream of tomato colored liquid floats Madre. Before Lisa can reposition herself, her mother bursts in. Tragically, the hovering liquid shoots across, slicing her mother's aorta instantly. Lisa stands frozen, never imagining her ability could be so deadly.

As the drug spread through her system, the girl swiftly lost consciousness. At dawn the next day, Lisa jolted awake and started screaming for help again. Confronted with this situation, the abductor returned to the shelf, retrieved the anesthetic, and Lisa blacked out once more. From that day forward, each time Lisa cried out, the man administered tranquilizer. After multiple repetitions, Lisa finally Learned to remain silent. Nevertheless, she fiercely resisted. When he tried to feed her, the kidnapper showed complete disregard, assisting with sedative injections. This pattern ultimately broke Lisa's will. Her captor grew pleased with her compliance. As a reward, he brushed her hair, even shaved her leg hair while she was deeply sedated. During conscious hours, he played guitar for her. Lisa found this profoundly puzzling. She needed to understand his true motives. Was this simply about Ransom demands? But kidnapper revealed he'd encountered Lisa at a bar days earlier. He'd wanted to buy her a drink and connect. But Lisa not only rejected him, but ridiculed him for being delusional. This humiliation enraged the abductor, so he secretly trailed Lisa. After learning her address, he immediately kidnapped her.

Two girls were trying to board a United flight in Denver when the gate agent stopped them, deeming their spandex leggings were inappropriate. The outrage began at Denver airport Sunday when two girls were denied entry onto a United flight by the gate agent. The reason, they were wearing spandex leggings. Passenger Shannon Watts tweeting, she's forcing them to change or put dresses on over leggings or they can't board. Since when does United Police women's clothing? United immediately responded, we do have the right to refuse transport for passengers who are barefoot or not properly clothed. The reaction on social media, fast and furious. Since when are leggings inappropriate? Is United Airlines fashion police or misogynist? United later clarified the girls were traveling on the airline's pass program which provides free flights for relatives and friends of United employees. The airline told us it has stricter dress code requirements for these non revenue passengers. United's policy does seem a bit more sexist than other airlines.

The baby's mother sued him for that amount to cover medical expenses. In Orlando, Florida, David Walker was walking down the street when he heard a scream coming from a building. Looking up, he saw a baby falling from a fourth floor balcony. Without thinking, he stretched out his arms and managed to catch the baby just before it hit the ground. He then handed the baby to its mother, who ran over to receive it, thanking David for his bravery. However, three days later, David received a legal notice. The mother accused him of breaking the baby's arm and demanded $300,000 in compensation. In court, David, in tears, explained that he only wanted to save the child and never intended to harm him. His lawyer argued that under Florida law, he should be considered a savior and not an aggressor, as his actions were not guilty. But the judge and jury decided that even though David was covered by the good Samaritan law, the consequences of his actions were severe, so they sentenced him to pay $100,000 in compensation. David, disappointed with the ruling, said he would never again intervene in other people's problems. Do you think this trial was fair? Let us know your opinion in the comments.

Para evitar momentos incómodos, hasta se tatuaron sus nombres en la cintura, pero aún así la gente no sabía quién era quién, así que decidieron hacerse cirugía estética. Annie, la hermana menor, quería cambiar su cuerpo, así que el médico le hizo un pequeño retoque en el pecho. Anna, la mayor, quería cambiar de cara, así que el médico le operó la nariz. También le remodeló las orejas, pero después de la operación, anna se echó a llorar en brazos de annie. El médico le preguntó qué había pasado y anna dijo que desde la cirugía ningún hombre se fijaba ya en ella. Toda la tensión se iba directamente hacia annie y eso le dolía muchísimo. Por eso le rogó al médico que la operara otra vez y la dejara como estaba antes. El médico se quedó sin palabras, pero al final aceptó y hasta hoy sigue sin entender qué piensan realmente las mujeres. Querer verse bien está bien, pero la belleza de verdad sale de dentro y toda cirugía tiene riesgos, así que no sigas a los demás sin pensarlo

The butcher could only turn his gaze toward me. Just as he was about to make his move, he suddenly got hit by a bullet. Turns out the cops had found the place. Even though the butcher was dead, my mind was seriously traumatized. Fast forward 10 years and the butcher's shadow still haunts my brain. To totally beat my inner demons, I didn't choose to face the fear head on. Instead, I became the butcher. So I dug up the butcher's miners outfit and pickaxe. Then I started my killing spree. First, I wanted to punish my ex who abandoned me and her current husband, David. So I staged multiple murders to make them think the butcher from 10 years ago is back. That way I could avoid suspicion and carry out my killing plan. Late at night, my ex and her best friend broke into a supermarket and I followed right behind them. To survive, they had to split up and run. That's when my ex suddenly tripped and fell at the critical moment. Her friend saved her life. Then the two of them escaped to a warehouse. I blocked the door with a cabinet. But for me, breaking in was just a matter of time. They tried to escape through the window, but I was already waiting outside. Next, I killed my ex's friend. My ex got so scared she ran toward the door and bumped right into her husband. David, even though I didn't get to kill her this time, I deliberately called her up and told her the butcher from 10 years ago was dead. The current butcher might be her husband in disguise. And the evidence was in the mind from 10 years ago. Then I tricked my ex into getting in the car and planned to take her into the mine to kill her. But after some investigating, her husband immediately called her and told her I was probably the butcher. He also said I had mental issues, but what did it matter if she knew she was going to die by my pickaxe anyway? But just as I was getting excited, she grabbed the steering wheel from me. That caused us to crash. I got knocked out cold. But she got out of the car and quickly called her husband. David told her to head to the cabin in the woods. As soon as she walked into the cabin, I showed up dressed as the butcher. She didn't suspect I was the butcher, though, because only her husband knew about the cabin. So she mistook the butcher for her husband.

Immediately, it was thrown into the air to feed a monster. In this world, anyone who farts is taken by the monsters. No one knows where these creatures come from. They only know that farting is forbidden. One day, a man eating dinner feels a gas building up in his stomach. His wife quietly warns him, honey, just don't think about it. Just the friends at the dinner table desperately gesture for him to hold it in, but he just can't help it. His body jumps suddenly. His friends angrily shove him outside. His wife is filled with despair. The man runs away crying. He hasn't even taken a few steps when a monster grabs him. From the darkness at night, a couple is about to go to sleep. Suddenly, the man smells something strange. What? What have you done? It's over. Okay. It didn't make a sound. I didn't think it would smell. I'm sorry. How do you know if it's gonna smell or not? And that's not how any of this works. It's after the woman falls asleep, the man sees this scene. The man realizes that farting attracts the monsters. He must protect his wife, who is about to give birth. So he collects his wife's gas in a glass jar and then runs in the opposite direction, buying time for his wife. But at the critical moment of her labor, the door behind her slowly opens. The husband accidentally breaks the jar and the wife becomes their next meal.

On my wedding day, I'm standing at the altar thinking, this is actually perfect. Thirty people I love most in the world are here after years of planning, and I'm marrying my best friend. Then I noticed my maid of honor keeps looking at her phone. She's holding her bouquet with one hand and her phone is in the other. I keep trying to make eye contact with her to put it away, but she's still scrolling, eyes glued to the screen. My husband squeezes my hand, and I try to focus on this moment. But I can see the blue light in the corner of my eye and hear her nails against the screen. The ceremony ends and the bridal group is walking back down the aisle. I'm greeting people when I see all of my bridesmaids clustered near the exit of a venue. I drift toward their direction and hear one of them say, we can make the rest of this wedding quick, right? The ceremony is done, so dinner next? Another bridesmaid nods. Yeah, we should be out by six, easy. My stomach groans. I stop walking so suddenly my husband almost trips over my dress. You okay? He asks. I nod, but I'm not. We planned this reception to go until nine. Once we're outside, my maid of honor appears next to me, already changed into jeans. Hey, babe. Amazing ceremony. Listen, I might have to leave early tonight. I just stare at her. Leave early? You're my maid of honor. This is my wedding. We sent save the dates 14 months ago. What could possibly. I can't even finish the sentence as my brain won't let me complete that thought. She does this little laugh. I know. I'm so sorry. Something came up. But I'm here now, right? She's here now at my wedding reception that we're 10 minutes into. My husband pulls me aside. What's going on? I pull out my phone because I can't shake this feeling that someone is plotting against us. I open Instagram and see a post from my college friend. A few days ago she posted, sorry I can't attend a loved one's wedding. Work sucks. One hour ago, she posted a boomerang of her blowing up balloons. Birthday bash tonight! Can't wait to see everyone at 7! I scroll down the comment section. 50 comments, all from people I know. I see my bridesmaids in the comments. All four of them. One person says, wrong account, girl. I didn't know my college friend had a second account. I keep scrolling through mutual followers until I find it on the second account. Two months ago, she posted save the date for my birthday party. And the date was for my wedding today. My invitations went out 16 months ago. I scan the room and spot my cousin who is known for having all the tea I asked her outright if someone is trying to upstage my wedding. My cousin debates on answering before handing me her phone. I'm sorry. The party just sounded so epic and I didn't want to hurt you. Her phone was open to a group chat called The Birthday Party. It has 100 people in it. All my bridesmaids are there. Over half my guests are included in the chat. My maid of honor left a message five days ago saying we'll just stay for the wedding ceremony and dinner, then head out. Should make the party by 7. Someone responds, she won't mind us leaving her wedding early, right? She's always so understanding. Then my maid of honor says, should we tell her we're leaving early? Only for my college friend throwing the party to say now? Why make it awkward? Just tell her you have to go in the moment. She won't have time to process all of you leaving. I screenshot everything and text it to myself. I walk over to where my maid of honor is standing with the other bridesmaids. I'm honestly surprised she's still here. They're all huddled together, looking at someone's phone. My heart is pounding. What time are you leaving? I asked them. They look up, startled. One bridesmaid says, what? I'm not leaving. I smile and say, for the birthday party, what time are you all leaving my wedding to go? You could hear a bouquet drop. My maid of honor looks At the others for help, but they're staring at the floor. I hold up my phone, showing the screenshots of their group chat. She announced her party eight months after I sent wedding invites. You all are a C P D S to both and didn't tell me? My maid of honor stammers. We just wanted to stop by afterward, but we're here for you. One of the other bridesmaids jumps in. You're being unreasonable. We can support both of you if we feel like it. I feel like I'm watching myself from outside my body. You plan to leave my reception early without telling me? That's not being my friend. That's treating me like your backup plan. My maid of honor's eyes narrow. That's not fair. We showed up, didn't we? I and to face the whole reception. Is anyone else leaving early for the birthday party? Please go now so I know who I'm actually celebrating my special day with. The silence is horrible. Then my cousin stands up. Then my coworker. My maid of honor storms out. The other bridesmaids follow her, and I'm standing there, watching half my guests walk out the door. My husband wraps his arm around my shoulders. Well, now we know who actually cares.

I wanna thank you for asking me this question, cause I haven't talked that much about it. In April of 2020, when oil went negative, Donald Trump brokered a deal with OPEC plus and Mexico to cut production drastically. Now, keep in mind this was the same time he was telling us that COVID was gonna go away really quickly and we would all get back to work and everything would be fine. Except here's the problem with that. The deal he cut to cut production. The biggest production cut in history was a two year fucking deal, and we're still inside that deal. It expires the end of next month. So if you're wondering why OPEC isn't producing more, there's your fucking answer. Now, this deal does not impact U S. Producers. And although OPEC has decided to increase production ever so slightly, they're still pretty much sticking to this deal. And there's your gas prices.",https://www.tiktok.com/@dizakn132106/video/7575219162260262175

She'd been acting strange since we announced the pregnancy three months ago. First it was little comments that happened fast when we've been trying for two years. Are you sure about the dates? When I knew exactly when we conceived. Denise must be shocked when he cried with joy at the positive test. Then she started the rumor campaign. Calling Denise's mother, asking if we had problems. Telling his cousin she was worried about our marriage. Marriage? Asking my sister if I'd been acting suspiciously lately. Everyone brushed her off as she kept pushing. I'm just concerned she'd say. Something feels off about this whole thing. The gender reveal was her idea. Insisted on planning it at her house. Said she wanted to do something special for her brother's first baby. We should have known better, but Denise wanted to keep the peace. She'd been his best friend growing up until she got weird when we started dating. The party started fine. Pink and blue decorations everywhere. Games about guessing the gender, a cake that would reveal the answer when cut. Rachel played the perfect hostess until it was time for the reveal. Denise and I stood in front of everyone with a knife ready. Rachel clinked her glass. Before we find out if it's a boy or girl, I have something important to say. Denise Tensed beside me. Rachel, not now, he said. Yes, now. Everyone needs to know the truth. She turned to the crowd. This baby can't be Denise's. It's impossible. The silence was complete. My mother's mouth fell open. Denise's father stood up. Our friends looked between us and Rachel. What are you talking about? Denise asked. I know about the vasectomy, Rachel announced triumphantly. The one you got three years ago when Jessica trapped you with a pregnancy scare. You never wanted kids. You made sure you couldn't have them. So whoever's baby this is, it isn't yours. Jessica was Denise's ex. The pregnancy scare was real, but it wasn't a trap. She'd miscarried at eight weeks, and they broken up soon after. Denise had gotten a vasectomy because Jessica didn't want kids, and he thought he loved her enough to give that up. But that was before me. Before he realized he did want children, just not with her. How do you know about that? Denise asked quietly. Jessica told me. We kept in touch. She said you were so relieved to never worry about kids again. So this baby. It's not yours? Can't be. He looked at me. With your satisfaction. Who's the father, Amy? Time to confess. My hands were shaking, not from guilt, but from rage. You're right about the vasectomy, I said loudly. Denise did have one. Gasps from the crowd my mother grabbed my father's arm. But you're missing some information, I continued. Like the Reversal surgery he had 18 months ago. After we got married. After we decided we wanted a family. After he realized his future wasn't with someone who didn't want children. Rachel's face went white. That's a lie. Denise pulled out his phone. Want to see the surgical records, the follow up appointments, the sperm count tests showing the reversal worked? You never said anything, Rachel stammered. Because it wasn't your business, Denise said. Our reproductive choices aren't family gossip. But Jessica said. Jessica doesn't know either, because, again, not her business. We don't owe anyone explanations about our medical decisions. Rachel looked around the room at 60 people staring at her with disgust. I was trying to protect you, she said to Denise. From what? My wife? My child? My happiness? From being tricked? The only trick here is you pretending to care about me while trying to destroy my marriage. I do care. That's why I stayed friends with Jessica. To make sure you were okay. You stayed friends with my ex to spy on me, to get information to use against Amy, because you've never accepted that I chose her. Jessica was better for you. Jessica didn't want children. Amy does. Jessica didn't want to get married. Amy did. Jessica didn't love me enough to compromise on anything. Amy loved me enough to wait while I got a surgery reversed and went through months of recovery. I walked over to Rachel. You wanna know the truth? Here's the Truth. The baby is Denise's. We have three different pregnancy tests, two ultrasounds, and a paternity test we did for fun because we were curious about genetic markers, all confirming what we already knew. You tried to ruin our marriage based on three year old information from a bitter ex girlfriend. I didn't know about the reversal, Rachel said weakly. Because you never asked. You just assumed the worst about me and announced it to everyone we love. Denise's mother stood up. Rachel, you need to leave. The ultrasound photos started circulating online. By the next day, someone had leaked them with Rachel's caption the truth about this pregnancy. Full story on channel link below.

Nothing red is allowed here. Not even a single red flower can stay. It must be picked immediately or it'll bring death. Because a bloodthirsty monster lives outside the village, red is its forbidden colour. If it sees red, it kills everyone in sight. Villagers can't leave the gate either. Step past the border and the monster tears you to pieces. But Eddie didn't believe the rumours. He not only left the village, he picked a bunch of red flowers in the forest. That very night, strange things happened. A night watchman saw a red draped monster charge into the village. He yanked the alarm bell. Hearing the bell, the villagers bolted for home. They hid in the cellars they'd prepared. Their faces showed exactly how terrifying the monster was. Right then, Eddie's girlfriend waited at the door, frantic. The monster was about to swallow her whole. Eddie arrived in time and yanked her inside. He slammed the door shut and rushed her into the cellar to hide. But the next day, the monster left a Mark on Eddie's door that meant its revenge wasn't over. To appease the monster, the villagers offered sacrifices at once, hoping to earn its forgiveness. Sure enough, the monster didn't show up that night. The village returned to a brief calm.

J'ai décidé de choisir ma femme en ouvrant des boîtes mystères. Quand la 1ère femme a enlevé la boîte, mes yeux se sont immédiatement illuminés. Son visage délicat m'a instantanément captivé. Je n'ai presque pas hésité à lui tendre 1 rose. Je lui ai même déposé 1 baiser léger sur la joue. Puis, c'était au tour de la 2e femme. Elle avait 1 silhouette élancée et 1 démarche élégante. Quand elle a enlevé la boîte et montré son visage parfait, j'ai de nouveau eu le coup de cœur. Je n'ai pas pu m'empêcher de lui offrir 1 autre rose. Je lui ai aussi dit qu'elle faisait partie de ma liste de sélection. Mais quand la 3e femme est arrivée, mon enthousiasme a instantanément disparu. Elle était vêtue de manière simple et même 1 peu ronde. Quand elle a lentement enlevé la boîte, elle n'avait même pas de maquillage. J'ai froncé les sourcils, ne comprenant pas comment elle osait participer à cette sélection dans cet état, je l'ai directement éliminé. Après le départ de la 3e femme, j'ai annoncé que la prochaine ronde commencerait immédiatement. Mais à ce moment-là, 1 accident est survenu. 1 cerise dans mon verre s'est coincée dans ma gorge. Je me suis immédiatement retrouvé à avoir du mal à respirer. Les 2 belles femmes que j'avais choisies ont reculé avec peur. Leurs yeux étaient remplis de terreur et d'hésitation. Elles pensaient même à partir et me laisser mourir sans rien Faire, au moment où je sentais que j'allais suffoquer, 1 silhouette familière est revenue précipitamment sans dire 1 mot. Elle m'a serré dans ses bras. Elle a forcé la cerise hors de ma gorge. La gratitude qui est montée du fond de mon cœur m'a fait la voir sous 1 autre jour. J'ai immédiatement décidé de lui donner 1 nouvelle chance. Je lui ai même permis de participer à nouveau à cette compétition. Mais lors de l'étape du baiser, j'ai encore hésité. Je lui ai souri, gêné, et lui ai dit qu'elle pourrait peut-être se maquiller d'abord. Cette fois, la femme ne s'est pas fâchée, elle a accepté ma demande et m'a demandé de fermer les yeux pour me faire 1 surprise. Je l'ai fait tout en imaginant à quoi elle pourrait ressembler après son maquillage. Mais quand je me suis approché pour l'embrasser, ce fut 1 visage glacé de papier qui m'a effleuré les lèvres. Puis la femme a mis la boîte sur ma tête et est partie sans se retourner. Il ne restait que moi, seul et abandonné sur place

Dad called. Your mother's planning to come anyway, she says. You can't stop a mother from seeing her daughter's wedding. I knew she meant it. For 28 years, she made sure I knew my place. Rachel's punching bag, both literally and emotionally. But I wasn't seven anymore. The morning of my wedding. My hands trembled as I applied lipstick. It hit me that this day would either be everything I dreamed of or the final break with my family. So when mom and Rachel arrived early, I took a deep breath and smiled like nothing had ever been wrong. I'm so glad you made it, I said, hugging them both. You have to see how beautiful everything turned out. I showed them around the lobby, pointing out the flowers and the way the sunlight hit the stained glass. The bridal sweets over here, I said, keeping my tone light. You can see the aisle from this angle. It's perfect. Right? Then I LED them toward the nursery. And remember the room I mentioned? The one with the perfect view of the ceremony. You'll love this. The room was just as I planned. Soft lighting, padded carpet, a big screen showing the ceremony room. I smiled as they stepped inside. It's soundproof, I said. Parents can bring their babies here and still hear everything from the main hall. Mom walked in first, Rachel close behind, still talking about the decorations. I'll step out to the reception hall and say something. So you can test how well it works, I said, keeping my tone light. They both nodded, turning towards the screen. I slipped out, hold the door closed and turn the lock. For a second, I just stood there, palm flat against the cool metal, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. Twenty eight years of being the good daughter ended with one small click. The pounding started immediately. Mom's muffled yelling, Rachel's ha, ha! Ha! Echoing through the padded walls. But those walls were built to muffle crying babies, and they worked. I walked back to the bridal suite. The makeup artist glanced up, startled at my calm face. For the first time in my life, silence didn't mean waiting for the next outburst. It meant peace. I stepped into my dress. It felt like armor. An hour later, I stood at the altar, watching my husband's face as he read his vows. His voice never wavered. Every word exactly as he'd written them, exactly as I'd dreamed. The ceremony was perfect silence. After the reception, I played dumb. Oh, my god, that door has been sticking! I told the venue about it last week. Thank goodness you could watch on the screen. Mom's face turned red. She didn't speak, just glared like I'd committed murder. After I forced her to watch my husband's parents walk me down the aisle. Before mom left the church that day, she cornered me, her face twisted with rage. You're dead to me, She hissed, I smiled. Yeah, I Learned from the best.

That's impossible! Frank shouted. Your grandmother would never. She did. Three months before she died. She transferred the deed, had it witnessed and notarized, filed it with the county. Why didn't anyone know? Sarah demanded. Because grandma asked me to keep it quiet. She wanted to see what Frank would do. Whether he'd honor her wishes or try to cash out this. This fraud. Frank slammed his hand on the table. You manipulated her. She was senile. She wasn't senile. I have medical records proving she was mentally competent. Her doctor signed off. Her lawyer was present at the transfer. What lawyer? Martin Chen. He's been the family attorney for 30 years. You know him? Frank pulled out his phone, started dialing. Don't bother, I said. He's expect in your call. I told him this conversation was happening today. Frank's finger hovered over the screen. Grandma knew you'd sell, I continued. She told me about the developer who'd been calling you for years. She knew you'd take it the second she was gone, so she gave it to you. Tim asked. Why you? Because I'm the only one who visits the farm every week. Who fixes the fences, who mows the fields. Who actually gives a damn about keeping it alive. Frank pointed a shaking finger at me. You conned an old woman. I took care of an old woman while you were planning her estate sale. Every Sunday for five years, I was there. Where were you? Silence! I asked her once why she didn't just leave it to all of us. I said, you know what she told me? I'm leaving it to the one who'll fight for it. The rest will just fight over it. Sarah started crying. This isn't fair! What's not fair is Frank telling everyone the farm is his when he never bothered to check. What's not fair is 40 people nodding along while he plans to pave over grandma's legacy for a shopping mall. Two million dollars! Frank shouted. Do you know what that could do for this family? I know exactly what it would do. You take the money, divide it up, and in five years nobody would remember there was ever a farm. So what are you going to do? Tim asked quietly. Keep it? Yeah, I'm keeping it. You can't afford that, Frank said. You're a teacher. You make nothing. I make enough. Full story on the channel linked below.

My sister Rachel has Tourette's. That makes her elbow. People stomp and yell ha, ha, ha! Loud enough to stop conversations three rooms away. It started long before I ever understood what it meant. When I was seven, one of her tics grabbed my hair and slammed my head into the wall. Mom didn't ask if I was okay. She just sighed and said, she's having such a hard day. Go play in your room. That moment started a pattern that never stopped. Rachel lashed out, I took it, and mom pretended not to see. Then last winter, I got a taste of a different kind of love. It was New Year's Eve when my. My boyfriend got down on one knee right as the fireworks exploded. He held my face in his hands and said, you deserve to be someone's first priority. I sobbed so hard I could barely say yes. For three days, I called friends, posted pictures, and planned venues. Once, I wasn't the family shock absorber. I was just Lisa, a woman in love planning her perfect day. Then my mom called. I've been saving for this since you were little. Let me pay for everything. Her voice tripped, honey, but I should have heard the poison underneath. We talked flowers and venues for 20 minutes before she dropped it. Of course Rachel will be your Maid of honor standing right behind you during the ceremony. I'm paying so I get to choose at least one bridesmaid. That's the rule. In that instant, every memory I tried to bury came barreling back. See, with Rachel, you had to know the right distance. Three feet was safe from the elbow. Five feet protected you from the stomping. Zero feet meant blood. When I was 12, Rachel threw a dinner plate at my face during Christmas. Seven stitches above my eyebrow. But I had to clean up the blood while mom comforted her. By 16, I Learned to back up everything twice because her stomping tick had destroyed too many of my things. Mom bought Rachel weighted blankets and therapy lamps and told me to be understanding. At 22, I watched Rachel elbow a pregnant woman at our cousin's wedding. The woman doubled over crying, but mom told everyone she was being dramatic. That's when I realized mom wasn't just enabling her. She was protecting the chaos because it kept her in control. So I told her no. Rachel could come to the reception, the rehearsal dinner, everything except the ceremony. I even offered the church nursery so she could watch on a TV screen that. I'm not paying for anything. Mom snapped. Fine, I said. My fiance and I will cover it. The next three weeks were hell. Mom called relatives saying I was able to. And cruel. She showed up at my apartment with Rachel To practice being calm. Ten minutes later, Rachel's elbow shattered my living room mirror. Shards of glass everywhere. This is what happens when you stress her out. Mom shouted, she's picking up on your rejection. The night before the

My 16 year old Sophie had been begging for AirPods Pro all summer, the new 300 dollar model. She'd researched every feature, watched countless unboxing videos, even created a detailed comparison chart showing why the Pro version was essential for her aesthetic. Her birthday arrived and I surprised her with the exact model. I was so proud finding them in stock when they'd been sold out everywhere. Her face dropped the second she opened the box. Um, these are the regular AirPods Pro. She held them like they were defective. I specifically said I need the AirPods Pro Max. Everyone at school has the Max version now. These make me look poor. The Max version. This kid wanted the $600 over ear headphones that cost more than my car payment. Her music career consisted of making 15 second TikTok dance videos to trending songs. The Pro version has the same sound quality I explained trying to salvage the moment. These are what actual musicians use for professional work. Mom, nobody cares about sound quality. It's about the look. These tiny earbuds are so basic. The max ones are a statement piece. Was already putting them back in the box. Can you just return these and get the right ones? It's only like 300 bucks more. Only 300 bucks more. Like I was made of money that's stung deep. I'd specifically researched which model music professionals recommended. I'd read reviews, compared features. Even asked my friend who works in audio production. I'll think about it, I said quietly, taking the box from her. She was already back on her phone. Thanks, mom. You're the best. Make sure you get the space grey ones, not silver. Silver looks cheap on camera. I just nodded and walked away. Next day, I'm at Apple store standing in the return line, still feeling terrible about the whole situation. The line was moving slowly and I could hear the customer service conversation happening ahead of me. I'm sorry, ma'am, your card was declined again. Do you want to try a different payment method? I looked up from my phone. A woman about my age wearing scrubs with Maria embroidered on them was standing there with her teenage son. He couldn't have been older than 15, wearing a faded band T-shirt and holding her hand supportively. Um, let me try this one, Maria said, pulling out a different card. Her hands were shaking slightly. Sorry, Miguel. I thought I had enough after paying rent. This one declined too, the employee said gently. The boy immediately stepped forward. It's okay, mom. I don't really need new earbuds for school. My old ones still work fine for online classes. Maria's shoulders sagged like someone had just crushed her dreams. Miho, you've been using those broken earbuds for two years. The left one doesn't even work anymore. And you need them for your virtual music lessons. Maybe next month I'll have Better tips from work, she said, her voice cracking. Your music teacher said you have real talent. You deserve proper equipment. Mom, sharing one earbud with my study group is fine. Besides, my music sounds better when we listen to.

My daughter had asked to sleep in my room for the third time in a row. She's 5, so I assume she was having nightmares or maybe she was going through a clingy phase. When she asked for the fourth time, I said yes. And as I was tucking her in, I asked why she kept asking to sleep in my room. She couldn't look at me as she told me, because mommy's friend gets into bed with me when you're gone. Her words didn't fully register at first. I asked her what she meant and she repeated it, adding that Mommy says it's okay because he's like family. I couldn't sleep at all that night. The next morning, I told my wife what our daughter had said and asked if anyone had been over recently. She brushed it off almost instantly, laughing a little and saying our daughter probably meant a stuffed animal or had made something up. She said, you know how kids are and change the subject. The way she said it was off as if she was prepared for that question and had her answer ready. A few days later, I told her I had to leave town for a short work trip. In reality, I stayed in a nearby hotel and logged into the security cameras I had installed last year after a neighbor's house had been broken into. I'd almost forgotten they were even still Active the next day. I got a motion alert around nine thirty PM from the hallway camera. I opened the feed. I saw a man I didn't recognize. He kissed my wife who entered our bedroom right after. But the man kept walking through the hallway and went straight into my daughter's room. He just walked in like he belonged there and my wife was fine with it. I was so scared for my daughter. I instantly got in my car and drove straight home. When I walked through the door, I didn't say a word, not even when my wife popped out of our room and nervously asked me what I was doing back home so early. I pushed past her and went into my daughter's room. I turned the light on.

The parents gave me a horrifying set of rules. I thought I hit the Jackpot when the Morrison family offered me $300 to babysit their daughter for one night. I had no idea this would be the last normal day of my life. The job seemed perfect, rich neighborhood, well behaved kid, easy money. What could go wrong? Everything, apparently. I arrived at their mansion on Elm Street. Mrs. Morrison answered the door looking absolutely exhausted, dark circles under her eyes, hands shaking slightly as she spoke. Thank god you're here, Riley, she said, practically pulling me inside. We haven't had a night out in months. Mr Morrison came downstairs carrying their seven year old daughter, Sophie. The little girl was adorable with curly blonde hair and big blue eyes, but something felt off. She didn't smile when she saw me. She just stared. Before we leave, Mrs. Morrison said, handing me several folded papers. These are very important instruction. Please follow them. Exactly. Sophie special. I nodded, stuffing the papers in my pocket without reading them. Mistake. They left in a hurry, practically running to their car. I should have known something was wrong when they didn't even say goodbye to Sophie. The first few hours went great. Sophie and I watched cartoons, played board games, ate pizza. She was sweet and polite, nothing like the weird, difficult kids I usually dealt with. Around 7:30, she yawned and said she was getting tired. What time is Your bedtime, I asked. Mommy says I have to be in my room with the door locked by eight PM she said, matter of factly lock. That seemed weird, but rich parents had strange rules sometimes. I figured I'd check the instructions once I got her settled, I tucked Sophie into her bed at 7:55. As I was leaving, she grabbed my arm. Don't forget to lock the door, she whispered urgently. And whatever you hear tonight, don't come back in here. Promise me. Why would I need to promise me, she said, her grip tightening. Okay, okay, I promise. I closed her door and noticed the heavy duty lock installed on the outside. Not a regular bedroom lock. This was the kind they used in psychiatric hospitals. My hands were shaking as I turned the key downstairs. I finally pulled out Missus Morrison's instruction. What I read made my blood turn to ice. Dear Riley, thank you for watching Sophie tonight. She is not like other children. At exactly eight fifteen PM, you will hear scratching coming from her room. This is normal. Do not unlock her door no matter what you hear at eight thirty PM

My wife Jenna has this thing where she's always late, not just fashionably late, but like 30 to 45 minutes late to everything, dinner with friends, movies, work meetings, family gatherings, you name it, she's gonna be late for it. It drives me absolutely insane. The worst part is how she acts about it like it's no big deal. She'll roll her eyes when I tell her we need to leave, say, relax, babe, we have time, when we absolutely don't, and then get mad at me for being stressed about it. I've started telling her events start an hour earlier than they actually do, but she caught on and now just shows up even later. Last month was the breaking point. We were supposed to meet my parents for my dad's birthday dinner at this nice restaurant. I told her we needed to leave by 6:30 to get there on time. At 7:15, she's still doing her makeup, telling me to chill out because they'll wait for us. We showed up at 8:20. My parents had already ordered appetizers and were halfway through their main course. My dad looked hurt, my mom was pissed, and I wanted to disappear. But two weeks ago, something happened that Jenna had been talking about for months. Her favourite singer was doing this acoustic set at a tiny venue downtown She'd been refreshing the ticket page for weeks trying to get seats and somehow managed to snag two tickets when someone cancelled last minute. She was beyond excited, posting about it on Instagram every day, telling everyone at work about it. The show was at eight PM on a Saturday. The venue was small, maybe 50 people max, and they were super strict about their no late entry policy.

I'm gripping the door handle so hard, my knuckles turn white. But then my mother in law says something that makes my blood run cold. I'm changing my will next week. Mira deserves the inheritance, not him. I've talked to my lawyer. There's a way to structure it so her husband can't touch a single penny. Even if they stay married, it all goes to her and the kids only. My sister in law laughs. Mom, you're brilliant. He's been mooching long enough. For context, I'm a civil engineer. I make 140 K a year. We split all expenses equally. I've never asked them for a single dollar. I stepped out from behind the pantry door. My mother in law is mid sentence. When she sees me, her eyes go wide. In perfect Korean, I said, I've understood every single word you've said about me for 25 years. Every insult, every joke about how Mira married down. Every comment about my nose, my weight, my work ethic, my intelligence. The color drained from both their faces. My sister in law's mouth literally fell open. My mother in law grabbed the counter like she might faint. I kept going in Korean. I heard what you said the night we got engaged. About the grandchildren looking Korean. I heard you tell your friends at our anniversary that you were waiting for Mira to leave me. I heard every single thing. My sister in law dropped her wine glass. It Shattered on the tile, red wine spreading everywhere. But neither of them moved. Just stared at me like I'd grown a second head. I switched back to English, my voice completely calm. I'll be telling Mira everything tonight. Every single thing you've said about me over 25 years. About her choices, about our kids, about your plans to cut me out of your will. Like I'm some kind of gold digger. My mother in law finally found her voice, but it came out as a whisper. Mira doesn't need to know about. About what? I interrupted. About how her own mother has spent two and a half decades disrespecting her husband in a language she thought I couldn't understand. About how you've been planning to manipulate your inheritance to make sure I know my place behind them. I saw Mira walk into the kitchen doorway. From the look on her face, she'd heard at least the last part. How long? She asked me quietly. Since the engagement dinner. My mother in law turned around and saw her daughter standing there. She started speaking rapidly in Korean, but I cut her off in English. Mira deserves to understand every word this time. Then I walked out, leaving them standing in broken glass and 25 years worth of lies.

They're Korean. And from day one they made it clear I wasn't good enough, too white, too poor, wrong background. At our engagement dinner, my mother in law said something in Korean while looking directly at me. My wife's sister laughed so hard she almost choked on her water. When I asked what was funny, they exchanged glances and said, just an inside joke. You wouldn't understand and kept speaking Korean the rest of the night. Here's the thing, though. I speak Korean fluently. I studied it in college, lived in Seoul for two years teaching English and continued practicing after I moved back. But I never told them why. Because what my mother in law actually said that night was at least the grandchildren will look Korean. So I made a choice. For 25 years, I've sat through every family dinner, every holiday gathering, every birthday party listening to them trash talk me in Korean while I smiled and nodded like an oblivious idiot. I heard every insult, every cruel joke, every comment about how Mira could have done better. When our son was born, my sister in law said in Korean, thank god he has her eyes and not his. At our 10th anniversary, my mother in law told her friends still waiting for Mira to wake up and leave him. Last Christmas, while I was carving the Turkey, they discussed whether my American Laziness was genetic and would affect our kids work ethic. My wife Mira doesn't speak Korean. Her parents never taught her, saying she needed to focus on being properly American for school. The irony isn't lost on me. I kept my secret because I figured their opinion didn't matter as long as Mira loved me, and she does. We've built an incredible life together. But last week, something happened that made me finally break my silence. We're at my daughter's college graduation party. Big Celebration at our house. Both families there, about 40 people total. I'm in the kitchen grabbing more drinks from the garage fridge when my mother in law and sister in law walk in, speak in Korean. They don't see me behind the open pantry door. He's getting fat. Did you see his stomach? I know. Poor Mira. Remember that doctor she dated before him? Park's son? He just bought his third house. At least the kids look Korean. Thank god they don't have his ugly nose and they got Mira.

He walked closer and said loud enough for everyone to hear that maybe daddy could get me a job at McDonald's since I couldn't handle real work.

Derek started stuttering and saying he didn't know and there must be some misunderstanding. My dad told him the only misunderstanding was Derek thinking he had any authority left in this building and that security would be up in 5 minutes to escort him out. Then my dad asked me to come up to his office on the top floor. Derek tried to follow me to the elevator saying we could work this out and he was just trying to maintain standards. I told him the only standard he maintained was being consistently terrible to everyone. Security showed up right as the elevator doors closed.

My sister Felicity was halfway down the aisle when I realised the champagne I just sipped tasted wrong, bitter and chalky with this weird metallic aftertaste that made my tongue feel thick. I set the glass down on my lap and tried to focus on the ceremony, but my vision started getting blurry around the edges. The string quartet playing Cannon and d sounded like it was underwater and far away, even though they were only 20 feet from where I sat in the second row. My hands started tingling first, then my feet. And I looked down at the champagne flute, realizing something was seriously wrong with whatever I just drunk. I tried to stand up to get help, but my legs wouldn't cooperate and I ended up half falling into the aisle. Felicity's new mother in law, Diane, rushed over and grabbed my arm hard enough to bruise, yanking me back into my seat with surprising strength for someone in her 60s. She hissed in my ear that I was making a scene at my sister's wedding and needed to sit down and be quiet, quiet like a proper bridesmaid. I tried to tell her something was wrong with my drink, but my words came out slurred and wrong, like my mouth wasn't working right anymore. Diane leaned in closer and whispered that she, I knew exactly what I'd done, that she'd watched me Trying to steal attention from Felicity all week, my vision tunneled even more and I could feel my pulse hammering in my neck and temples while sweat started soaking through my bridesmaid dress. The efficient was asking if anyone objected to the marriage, and I wanted to scream and that someone had poisoned me. But Diane's hand clamped over my mouth before I could make a sound. She pressed so hard I tasted blood from where my teeth cut into my lip. And her other hand stayed locked around my arm, keeping me pinned to that chair. I tried to bite her hand or scratch her or do anything to get free, but my body felt like it was moving through syrup and nothing worked the way it should. The ceremony kept going while I felt myself slipping further away from consciousness. I could hear the vows being exchanged, but they sounded muffled and distant, like I was listening from the bottom of a swimming pool. Diane finally let go of me once the kiss happened and everyone started clapping, and I immediately slumped forward onto the person in front of me. They turned around looking irritated until they saw my face and their expression changed to concern. People started noticing and a few guests gathered around asking what was wrong while I lay there unable to move or speak properly. My chest felt tight and breathing was getting harder with each attempt. And I realized with absolute terror that This wasn't just being drunk or having a panic attack. Someone had actually poisoned that champagne and I was dying right there on the ground at my sister's outdoor wedding. Diane pushed through the small crowd and announced loudly that I was clearly drunk and had embarrassed myself in the family. She told everyone to give me space and let me sleep it off in one of the back rooms at the Venue. 2 groomsmen picked me up under Diane's direction and started carrying me away from the ceremony area. I tried to tell them I needed a hospital, that someone poisoned me, but all that came out was garbled nonsense that made them laugh like I was just really wasted. They hauled me up the back stairs of the mansion and into a small storage room that smelled like dust and old furniture, then dumped me on a moth eaten couch before leaving and closing the door behind them. I heard the lock click and realized Diane had just had me imprisoned in this room while whatever was in that champagne worked its way through my system. My almost back at my seat and there was no way to call for help. The room had no windows, just shelves of old decorations and boxes stacked against the walls. I don't know how long I lay there drifting in and out of consciousness, but at some point I heard voices outside the door. Diane was talking to someone about how I'd always been jealous of Felicity and had probably taken something to get attention. I tried to scream to let them know I was actually dying, but my voice wouldn't work anymore. The footsteps walked away and I was alone again. With my heart beating irregularly and my breathing getting shallower, the edges of my vision went completely black and I felt myself slipping away, wondering if anyone would even notice I was gone until it was too late. And that's when the door locked behind me. The rest of the story is linked below or on my channel.

I said, prove it. Then I moved out that night and started dating her untouchable model friend who had been secretly in love with me. I, 29, ma'am, was washing dishes last Wednesday when my fiance, Kelsey, 27, dropped the most arrogant statement I'd ever heard. We were arguing about her spending one $200 on a designer bag when we were supposed to be saving for the wedding. She slammed her fresh manicure on the counter. You know what, Ethan? I could replace you in 24 hours. Literally. Guys are lined up waiting for me to be single. You should be grateful I even chose you. I stopped washing, turned off the water, dried my hands slowly. Prove it. She laughed. That mean girl. Laugh. What? You said 24 hours. Prove it. We're done. Clock starts now. I checked my phone. 7:23 p m. Wednesday. Her face went through confusion, amusement, anger, then smug confidence. You're bluffing. You can't even match your socks without me. I walked to the bedroom and started packing. She followed, listing reasons I'd fail. You don't know the Netflix password. Your mom likes me more. Good luck finding someone who looks like me. You're literally nothing without me. That last one made me pause. Not because it hurt, but because I realized she actually believed it. Three years fit in two suitcases and a backpack. As I was leaving, my phone buzzed. Adrian Kelsey's best friend. The one she called untouchable because she only dated millionaires. Heard you're single. Kelsey's already posting. You okay me heading to Jerome's? Adrian come to mine instead. We need to talk now. I showed up at 9 p m. She opened the door in sweats and a messy bun. Before you say anything, I need to tell you something I should have said two years ago. She showed me texts with Kelsey from 2022. My stomach dropped. Kelsey Ethan's getting too comfortable thinking about monkey branching to that lawyer guy from Pilates. Adrian that's messed up. Ethan's a good guy. Kelsey good. Doesn't pay for Mycanoe trips, but he's stable until I find better. Already added myself as authorized user on his AMX. Lol. There were dozens more plans to upgrade me. Her active hinge profile messages about backup guys, why didn't you tell me? I asked. I tried. Kelsey threatened to ruin me if I said anything. Then I've been in love with you since the day I introduced you to her, but I thought she'd be better for you. We talked until 4:00am. She let me crash in her guest room, and I watched Kelsey's replacement speed run. Our 1 6 thirst trap three different bars. Where are all the real men at? Videos got progressively sloppier. Our 7 to 16 matched with 30+ guys. Brought home some guy named Kyle who looked like he sold protein powder. Posted his back with upgrade already. I. Kyle left. She posted and deleted a crying selfie. Our 17 to 24 full panic. Texted me from three numbers. I win. I replaced you became. Can we talk? This isn't what I meant. At seven twenty three PM, Thursday, the 24 hour.

This went on for weeks. I told her multiple times to stop asking because we weren't sharing the name yet. She promised to stop and then the next day the text would start again. I start started just ignoring her when she asked. But that somehow made it worse. My husband and I had already picked out the perfect name months ago. We loved it and didn't want anyone's opinion on it. But we especially didn't want Katie to know because I had this gut feeling she would try to either use it herself or pick something that matched with it. See, Katie has always been a little competitive with me, not in a mean way, but in this weird twin way where she needs us to do everything together. Or similarly, when I got engaged, she got engaged four months later. When I bought a house, she started looking at houses in the same neighborhood. Last week, I finally hit my breaking point when she texted me seven times in one day asking about baby names. That's when Jake suggested we just give her a fake name. At first, I thought it was too mean, but then I thought about it more. Katie thinks any unique name is weird. I once told her years ago that I liked the name Meadow and she acted like I said I wanted to name my kid helicopter. So I figured if I gave her something.

She wasn't falling asleep at the kitchen table after school anymore. Her skin looked better, too, not as pale. Her teacher sent an email saying she was participating more in class. I knew it was working, but I couldn't tell her the truth. The second she found out those juice boxes were healthy, she'd stop drinking them. So I kept up the act. I'd shake my head when I'd see empty boxes in the recycling. I'd say things like, you're going through these too fast, while secretly buying two packs instead of one. Then I got bold with the food. She loved my spaghetti sauce but only ate the noodles with butter at other people's houses. One night I blended up carrots, zucchini and tomatoes and stirred it into the sauce, cooked it down for like two hours so it got really thick. She ate three bowls that night, said it was the best sauce I'd ever made. I started doing it with everything. Sloppy Joe's got blended peppers and onions. Meatloaf got shredded zucchini. I made a huge batch of each every Sunday and put them in containers so she could microwave them for lunch. During the week, she, she'd come home from school and tell me about how the other kids were jealous of her food. Last month, she asked me why my spaghetti sauce was so much better than the jar stuff her friend's mom uses. I told her it was because I Added extra tomato paste and let it cook longer. She believed me, went right back to eating. The juice box thing almost got exposed. Two weeks ago, we were at target and she saw them on sale. She grabbed my arm and pointed at the display all excited. I looked at the label with her standing right there. She was reading the front that said Fruit Punch in big letters. I made sure she didn't flip it around to see the back where it listed all the vegetables. I told her the sale wasn't that good and we'd just get them at our regular store.

Good man. But there's a story that needs to be told correctly. The room went quiet. I could feel my heart starting to pound. Marcus looked confused, then nervous. October 2017, outside FOB Wilson, vehicle hit, an I E. D caught fire. Three soldiers trapped inside. Jenkins looked directly at me. Military police specialist was running route security that day, first on scene. I watched him run straight into those flames. No hesitation. Pulled out all three soldiers while ammunition was cooking off inside. Burned his hands. Smoke inhalation kept going back. My dad's face went pale. Jenkins continued. Sergeant Collins was there. He was in shock from the blast. We retreating him for head trauma. When the rescue happened, good soldier. But he froze, couldn't move. Totally normal response to an I E. D strike. The room was absolutely silent. Every eye shifted between Marcus and me. The paperwork got mixed up in the chaos. Wards clerk put the wrong name down. By the time anyone realized it, the ceremony had already happened and Sergeant Collins was stateside. Jenkins looked at Marcus. Sir, I think you know this deep down. Marcus's face went bright red. He stood up. Chair scraping loud against the floor. This is bullshit, his voice cracked. He grabbed his jacket and walked out. The door slammed behind him. Jenkins turned to me. We can get this corrected, get you the recognition you actually earned. I shook my head. I didn't Do it for medals. I just wanted them to come home. The words came out quieter than I meant. They had. Families in that room nodded. They understood. But my dad just sat there staring at that display case like it had turned into something poisonous. We drove home in complete silence. Marcus won't return my calls. Dad can't look at me. Last night, my mom finally said something. I always knew you did more than you told us. Six years. Six years of being invisible while my brother wore my moment around his neck. And now that everyone knows the truth, my family is fractured into pieces. The veterans respect me now, but I'd almost rather have my family back, even if it meant staying invisible forever.

I'm a military police specialist. My older brother Marcus is an infantry sergeant. We both deployed to Kandahar in 2,017. And he came home with a Silver Star. I came home to my dad asking if I'd written any speeding tickets or over there every Thanksgiving, every Christmas, every fourth of July barbecue for the past six years, that metal comes out. Dad keeps it in this fancy wooden display case and he sets it right in the middle of the table like a centerpiece. Marcus tells the story how he pulled three soldiers from a burning vehicle after an IEE strike, how he ran through flames while rounds were cooking off, how he saved three lives that day. And I sit there eating potato salad while dad beams and says things like, now that's a real soldier. That's what service looks like. Then he turns to me. You were just doing police work, right? Checking IDS at the gate. I'd correct him. I was route security, criminal investigations, detaining operations. He'd wave his hand, sure, sure. But Marcus was really in it. You know, my uncle once asked what I did over there. And before I could answer, dad jumped in. He was basically a cop, wrote reports while the real soldiers fought. Marcus never corrected him, just smiled and changed the subject. I stopped trying to explain what MPs actually do stopped mentioning the convoys, the raids, the times we were first on scene didn't matter. I wasn't infantry, so I wasn't really a veteran in their eyes. Last Tuesday, there was a veterans town hall at the VFW in our hometown, mental health resources, VA benefits, that, that kind of thing. Marcus and I both went. Dad came, too. And I swear to god he brought the metal case, set it on the table next to his coffee like he was Marcus's manager or something. During the open discussion, this guy in his 40s stood up, Corporal Jenkins. I recognized him immediately from our deployment. He'd been in Marcus's unit. I wanna talk about something that's been bothering me for years, Jenkins said. He pointed at.

Her face was red. I'd never seen her this angry. Ten of us raised our hands, including me. All of you, outside now! We filed out, confused. What are we doing out here? I asked, but she wouldn't answer. Just looked at me like I was the reason rent prices were so high. Then she turned around and started leading us through the hallways in silence. I turn to my buddy John. Where do you think we're going? I don't know, dude, but with how mad she is, I wouldn't be surprised if it's Valhalla. We ended up at the principal's office. The principal was there waiting. So was a police officer. My stomach dropped. We all sat down. The officer had a notepad. Nobody was talking. We were all staring at each other. What the hell was happening? The teacher stood at the front, arms crossed. All of you watch anime, correct? We nodded. Who here has seen Dragon Ball Z? Nine hands went up. One kid's hand stayed down. Dexter piped, you haven't seen Dragon Ball Z? Dude, yo, you gotta watch it! Shut up, idiot! The teacher interrupted Dexter. You. She pointed at the kid who hadn't seen Dragon Ball. Back to class. She just called Dexter an idiot. And the principal didn't even flinch. Whatever happened had to have been really serious. Teacher continued, who here has seen Naruto? Two more kids lowered their hands. You? Two leave. Seven of us left now. I looked at John. He was pale, hands gripping his knees. Who here has seen one piece? Three kids shook their heads out. Just five of us now. Me, John and three others. My heart was pounding. The officer was taking notes on his clipboard. Who here draws anime? Like manga art? The teacher asked. The three other kids hesitated, then shook their heads. Back to class. Just me and John left. The teacher stared at us. Her jaw was clenched. You two, back to the classroom. We'll call you later. We stood up immediately and walked out in silence. And the hallway. John's hands were shaking. Dude, what was that? I whispered. I don't know, man. Something in his voice sounded wrong. We got back to class. Everyone stared at us. What happened? Someone asked. We didn't answer. The rumors started immediately. Whispers spreading through the room. Lunch came and went. I could. After lunch, the teacher walked back in. You too? She pointed at me and John. I need you to grab one of your anime drawings. Bring it to the principal's office. My mouth went dry. We went to our lockers. I grabbed my sketchbook. John grabbed his. We walked to the office together. John wasn't talking. His face was white. We entered the office. The principal was there, the officer, the teacher, and someone else. The teacher's daughter. She was in our class, but she. He hadn't raised her. Hand. Earlier. Why is she here? I asked. Nobody answered. The teacher held out her hand. Your drawings. We gave her our sketchbooks. She handed them to her daughter. The daughter flipped through my entire booklet, then through John's, then mine, then John's again. Finally, she stopped on one page. The most recent one. The one with the new art style John had been working on. Her finger pointed down. That's it. The police officer stood up. He walked to John. You have the right to remain silent. Handcuffs. John's voice cracked. What? What are you doing? We're taking you to the station. We advise you cooperate. The officer was leading John to the door. John looked back at me. I didn't do anything. Tell them. I couldn't move, couldn't speak. Door closed. John was gone. The daughter left the room. I stood there, shaking. Is anyone going to explain what the hell just happened? I asked, relieved but worried at the same time. The principal leaned back in his chair. Remember how your class did secret Santa last week? I nodded. Well, someone gave her daughter a gift. He gestured at the teacher. It was a hand drawn manga. Detailed, multiple pages. I was confused. What's wrong with a manga as a present? That's when the teacher's voice cut through. Ice cold. That manga he gave her showed my underage daughter in inappropriate scenarios with characters from Naruto, Dragon Ball Z, and one piece. I stared at her as Tears filled her eyes. Someone drew my daughter as lowly content and gave it to her as a secret Santa gift. The room was spinning because it was secret Santa. We didn't know who made it, so we staged this. The principal gestured around. The questions, the filtering, all of it. I sat down. Damn. And John dead ass snitched on himself. Huh

He didn't. Then it kept happening because she needed to be sure he'd eventually come to his senses and end it. He never did. She actually sat there listing dates and locations like she was reading a grocery list. The conference room at his office when I was visiting my sister, our bed when I was at my book club, her apartment every Thursday when I thought she had therapy. Six months of lying to my face while claiming she was protecting me. The worst part was how she acted like I should thank her. She literally said, I was lucky to find out now before we had kids, that she saved me from wasting more years on him, that a real friend would do this for someone they loved. I stood up, through $40 on the table and walked out. She followed me to my car, still explaining how this was actually a good thing. I drove straight home, packed Brian's things while he was at work. Everything he owned fit in six garbage bags. I left them on the lawn with a note that said Lisa could help him move since they were so close. Then I called my lawyer cousin about divorce papers. Brian came home early, found his stuff outside, started banging on the door. I didn't answer. He went to stay with his brother. Lisa kept texting me essays about How she sacrificed herself for our friendship. How sleeping with my husband was the hardest thing she'd ever done, but she loved me enough to do it. The delusion was unreal. She even asked if I wanted details about what positions he liked so I'd know for my next relationship. I blocked her on everything. Brian tried to apologize through his brother, said Lisa pursued him aggressively and he was weak. His brother actually agreed with him until I explained Lisa's loyalty test story. Then even his brother called him pathetic. The divorce papers were filed within a week. I'm taking the house since it was my grandmother's. Yesterday, I heard from a mutual friend that Lisa was confused why everyone was taking my side. She apparently told everyone she exposed Brian's cheating to save me, leaving out the part where she was the one he cheated with. But people figured it out when Brian drunkenly admitted everything at a bar. Now she's calling around crying that she lost her best friend trying to help me. The mutual friend asked if I wanted to reconcile once Lisa apologized properly. I said Lisa could test someone else's husband's loyalty. I'm done being her friend.

Lisa and I had been friends since college. We were roommates freshman year, got matching tattoos at 19, held each other through every breakup. When I married Brian four years ago, she was my maid of honour. She gave this beautiful speech about how she'd never seen me happier, how Brian was the man I deserved. Everyone cried. She helped me pick my dress, planned my bachelorette party, fixed my veil when it got caught in the church door. After the wedding, she was at our house constantly, Sunday dinners, random movie nights. She had a key for emergencies. Brian liked her, too, said I was lucky to have such a loyal friend. When Lisa's mom got cancer last year, I drove her to every single appointment, held her hand during the bad news, made sure she ate, basically moved her into our spare room for three months. Brian was amazing, too. He'd pick up her prescriptions, fix things at her apartment while she was at the hospital. We were her family. Her mom recovered, thank god. And Lisa said she owed us everything. Two months ago, Lisa started acting weird. She'd cancel plans last minute, barely text back, showed up late to my birthday dinner. I figured work stress. She was always complaining about her new boss. Ryan was acting strange, too, working late more often, keeping his phone face down. Showering the second he got home. I thought maybe he was planning something for our anniversary. Last Tuesday, Lisa asked me to lunch, said she had something important to tell me. I thought maybe she was dating someone new. We sat down at our usual spot and before I even ordered, she said she'd been sleeping with Ryan for six months. My brain just stopped. She kept talking, though, said she did it for me, that she needed to test if he was really loyal, if he'd resist temptation, that she'd been trying to seduce him to see if he was worthy of me, like she was doing me some kind of favor. She said the first time was after my birthday party when I went to bed early with a headache.

They've never been here. He made a sound halfway between a scream and a sob. I put them in a taxi Thursday morning. If you sent them Thursday, they've been missing for three days. He started screaming. I could hear Olivia in the background asking what was wrong. He couldn't even form words. I hung up, called 9 1 1, then pulled every contact I had. Patrol officer, friend, dispatch connection, search and rescue contact. Within an hour, three officers worked the case with. Then two. They tracked the taxi the driver dropped kids at 14 87 Maple street. Hour three, police located the house. Kids were safe. Helen had protected them. I drove there immediately. Seeing them in that strange house broke something in me. They ran to me crying, I've got you. You're safe. Isaac was at my apartment, pounding my door when he saw us. Relief mixed with rage. Where were they? Three days at a stranger's house. But I gave your address. Wrong address. And you never followed up? Never confirmed arrival. Just assumed. Excuses started. He'd been busy. The trip was booked. You need to leave tomorrow. We're explaining to child services why you ship children to someone who said no. You're ruining my life over a mistake. You made it. I'm documenting it. Monday, I contacted CPS. Full timeline, police reports, statements. Investigation opened immediately. Olivia had no idea. Isaac told her the kids were with his parents. Sent Old photos. Finding out they'd been lost three days while he lied broke her. She moved out within a week. Filed for separation. Court was brutal. Isaac claimed vindictiveness. His lawyer called it honest error. The judge disagreed. Children under 8 sent alone with no verification, no follow up for 72 hours. Criminal negligence. Isaac lost custody. Supervised visitation only. Olivia won full custody. Isaac got every other weekend. Supervised child support and a criminal record. Lost his job over child endangerment charges. Six months later, Isaac called from different numbers. Voicemails about how I destroyed his life. I saved them, but never responded. I didn't destroy his life. He did when he chose convenience over safety. Years later, Marie's 14, wants to be a lawyer. Owen's 12, into computers. Thriving with Livia. Isaac tried reconnecting recently. They're not interested. Old enough to understand, old enough to choose. I'm just the aunt who said no and meant it.

I had no chance with her anymore. Thirty seconds left. Jack is still staring, still going, face getting redder. I grab paper and write the fastest note of my life to the teacher. My handwriting looks like a drunk spider, but whatever. Jack is doing inappropriate things aimed at me. Please help now. I fold it and speed walk it to Evans's desk, reads it. His eyes scan it once, twice. For a second, I think he understand what's going on. But then he scrunches it up and wraps it into a ball, throws it in the trash. Back to your seat now, sir. Please. Back to your seat. Jack is watching me walk back, still smirking, still going. He's not even trying to hide it anymore because he knows Evans won't do anything. The whole situation is about to get so much worse. And Evans is just sitting there grading papers. Lucy is passing notes. Now other kids are starting to notice. The whole room knows what's happening except the one adult who's supposed to stop it. I turn my chair sideways. Jack adjusts his angle like he's got some kind of targeting system. Mr Evans shouted again, face your chair forward. Last warning. He's about to. One more word and it's Saturday detention. Lucia stands up. Mr Evans, everyone, eyes on your own work. Jack's breathing got Faster. His face went from red to purple, his whole body tensing up. And I could see the exact moment he was about to lose it. Time slowed down. I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. I knew I had maybe three seconds before no nut November became the worst month of my life. I threw myself off my chair like I was dodging a dodgeball, hit the ground just as Jack finished his little personal project into his bookbag instead of my face. The room went dead silent except for the clock ticking and someone going, oh, my gosh. Fast forward a week later and Jack followed me into the bathroom and started doing it again. But he wasn't ready for the pocket snake that I threw at him. And let's just say he never lost no nut November again.

No nut November. I used to have a best friend named Jack. Everything was cool until he started making gay jokes. He wasn't even gay. He was just trying to be annoying. It started small at first. Normal joked about me being handsome and stuff like that. But within weeks, the a jokes became his new form of rage bait. He'd make jokes about how I want him. So when we both got detention at the same time, he kept calling it our detention date and making kissy faces when the teacher wasn't looking. We were five minutes into detention when his hand starts moving up and down under the desk at lightning speed and there's no paper on his desk. It was like he was asserting dominance or something, making sure I knew this was about me. He was breathing like he just ran a Marathon while sitting completely still. He looks up right at me, not a glance, full eye contact while his hand is still going full turbo under the desk. My brain just froze like when your computer shows you that spinning wheel of death. Then I noticed his chair. He's turned it toward me and the angle when he finishes, it's gonna hit my face. I had two minutes maybe less. Face was getting red. I tried to reach for the phone in my pocket to text someone to help but the teacher, Mr Evans notices instantly. Phone on my desk. Now Mr Evans has a radar for phones. I swear you know the rules. I walk up and put it on his desk, locks it in his drawer. Great. No lifeline, no evidence, no nothing. While I was walking back, I can see Jack tracking me with his eyes, that same smirk from when he'd make his stupid jokes. But his hand hasn't stopped moving. I get up real quiet and start moving to the empty seat behind him. Where do you think you're going? Evans doesn't even look up. It's a sign, seating only. Go back to your seat. Sir. Sir, I just need to, you need to apologize to Jack for disrupting his concentration and sit back down. Wait, what? I'm sorry. Go on, apologize. I look at Jack, his smirk gets bigger. Sorry, Jack. His voice comes out all breathy and weird. It's cool, bro. Good. Now sit down. The walk back felt like death row. Lucia, the girl I've had a crush on since freshman year, notices what's happening. Her face goes from confused to horrified to buried in her textbook.

Real family only. He said. My wife didn't defend me. I left the party early. By the time they needed me to co sign their mortgage refinance, I was already filing for divorce. My father in law waved me out of the frame. Step back, Jason. Real family only. I stood there holding Emma, my daughter, her first birthday, 50 people watching, pink balloons. My wife's entire family crowded around the cake. I'm her father. I said, you married in. That's different. Frank Jester impatiently. Blood relatives, come on, we're losing the light. My hands went numb. I looked at Sarah, my wife, waiting for her to say something. He avoided my eyes, reached over and took Emma from my arms. The room went silent. 50 people watched me step aside. Frank positioned everyone, smiled, cracked jokes, took a dozen photos. I stood alone against the wall, an outsider at my own daughter's birthday. When the photos finished, Frank walked past me. Nothing personal, just want the bloodline documented properly. I found my keys. Sarah caught me at the door. Where are you going home, Jason? Don't be dramatic. It's just a photo. Your father called me an outsider and you handed him our daughter. He's old fashioned and you're my wife. You should have defended me. She crossed her arms. You're making this bigger than it is. I stared at her, really looked at Her? No. I'm finally seeing it clearly. I left, sat in my driveway for 20 minutes, hands shaking, and I called my lawyer. Monday morning, I filed for divorce. Sarah got served at work. On Thursday, she called me screaming, are you insane? No. I'm done being treated like I don't belong in my own family. Over a photo, over 3 years of being disrespected while you watched. We can fix this. You had your chance when your father called me an outsider. You could have said something. You didn't. I hung up. Her mother called the next day. You're being selfish. Think about Emma. I am thinking about Emma. I'm thinking she deserves a father who doesn't teach her it's okay to let people disrespect her husband. You're tearing this family apart. Your husband did that. When he made it clear I'm not family, I blocked her number. Two weeks of lawyers, mediation, Sarah crying, her family calling me every name in the book. I didn't care anymore. Then Frank called. I almost didn't answer. Jason, we need to talk about what our mortgage, the banks requiring us to refinance. Interest rates went up. His voice.

You wanted blood relatives only. Go ask one of them. None of them qualify. Not my problem. We don't refinance, we lose the house. My heart pounded. Three years of humiliation.

She stood by while you humiliated me. Listen, you wanted real family only, Frank. Well, congratulations. Now you get to find out what that actually means. I hung up. Sarah called immediately. My dad just told me you have to co sign. No, I don't. They'll lose their house. I lost my family. Seems fair. This is cruel. You know what's cruel? Watching your father in law erase you from your daughter's birthday while your wife stands there silent. I didn't know what to say. My voice went cold. You could have said, dad, that's my husband.

Jason, they're my parents and I was. Your husband was. I hung up. Three days later, the bank rejected their refinance application. Frank called one last time. You're really going to let us lose everything? I thought about Emma's first birthday, standing against that wall, 50 people watching me get erased. No, Frank, you already lost everything. You just didn't realize it until you needed me. Please tell me again how I'm not real family. The line went quiet. That's what I thought.

Three days later, I got the call that destroyed him. My brother Isaac believed his problems automatically became my emergencies. For four years, babysitting requests expanded. Hours became days. Days became weekends. Weekends became constant emergencies. Isaac's surprise work trips were golf weekends. Livia's emergency appointments were spa days. They assumed I wouldn't question family. Three weeks before my first vacation in 18 months, I sent a group text off completely. March 15th to 22nd, phone on silent. Isaac responded with a thumbs up. Three days before vacation, he called. The kids can stay with you Thursday, right, since you're free anyway. No, I have plans. You're staying home doing nothing. The answer is no. He exploded. You're selfish. You're destroying our marriage. When are you going to act like family, Isaac? I've babysat 60 times in two years. I'm being unavailable, not selfish. It's one week to save my marriage. No. Find other childcare. He hung up. Guilt text flooded in from mom, dad, Olivia. I didn't respond. Thursday morning, I woke up, naturally, made breakfast, pure peace. I didn't know was Isaac had decided to force it anyway. He called a taxi at 9:00am, put Marie, 7, and Owen, 5, in the back with a small bag. No note, no call, just shipped them. But Isaac mixed up my address. I live at 18 47 Maple street, he told the driver. 14, 87 Maple street, 4 miles away. The taxi dropped two children at a random house and left. Helen was gardening when she found two confused kids on her curb. She assumed they were at the wrong house. Their parents would realize any minute nobody came. Helen brought them inside, gave them juice and cookies. The kids knew they were going to Aunt Nat's but didn't know my address or last name. Evening came, no parents. She made dinner, set up her guest room. Friday passed. Then Saturday, 72 hours in a stranger's house. Saturday evening, my phone rang. Hey, thanks for taking the kids after all, Isaac said, cheerful, ice cold. What? The kids? Thanks for not making a big deal. What kids? Silence. My kids, the ones I sent Thursday.

So my whole family had been using my Amazon Prime account for like three years. My mom, my sister Ashley, my Uncle Rick, even my grandma somehow figured out how to order stuff. I was paying for it because I actually use Amazon all the time for work stuff and groceries. But they were just leeching off it. The breaking point happened two weeks ago. I check my account and see 17 packages coming to different addresses, 17. My sister ordered a whole workout set she'll never use. My mom got some fancy face cream that cost 60 bucks. And my Uncle Rick ordered a drone he definitely doesn't need. But the worst part was my cousin Blake ordered a gaming chair that cost $400. I called Blake and asked him what the hell he was thinking. He just laughed and said it's not his problem. I gave everyone access, said if I didn't want people using it, I shouldn't have shared the password. This kid just graduated high school and acts like he runs the world. So I called my mom and told her everyone needed to chip in for prime or get their own accounts. She got all dramatic and said family should help each other out. She reminded me how she used to buy me clothes when I was younger. I told her that was literally her job as a parent and not the same thing at all then Ashley calls me crying, saying she can't afford her own prime account because she's saving for a wedding. I reminded her that her wedding is in two years and she just spent $300 on workout clothes she returned last month. She said I was being petty and that it's only like $10 a month split between everyone. I did the math. If everyone chipped in 10 bucks, that would actually cover prime and give me extra money. But when I suggested this in our family group chat, suddenly everyone had excuses. My mom said she's on a fixed income. Ashley said she's saving for the wedding. Rick said he barely uses it anyway, which is a lie because he ordered protein powder just yesterday. The final straw was when my grandma called me confused about why her soap order got cancelled. Turns out my account got flagged for suspicious activity because there were so many different addresses. Amazon temporarily locked my account and I couldn't order my medication refills. That's when I snapped. I changed the password and removed everyone's.

I'm documenting disability discrimination, Karen announced to the crowd, still gripping my chair. This woman is refusing to share public resources with a child. Public resources? I stared at her in disbelief. This is my wheelchair. I bought it with my insurance for my paralyzed legs. Wheelchair should be community property for educational purposes, she declared, making up policies on the spot. That's when Coach Martinez, a 6 foot 4 inch former college football player stepped in. Ma'am, you need to remove your hands from her wheelchair. Immediately said in a voice that could stop traffic. She's discriminating against my son. Karen protested, finally letting go. No, coach Martinez said. Slowly. You're assaulting a person in a wheelchair on camera that your husband is recording. Dave's face went white as he realized what he'd actually captured. Furthermore, the coach continued asking someone to give up their medical equipment so your kid can try being disabled. Probably the most offensive thing I've heard this season. Pack up and leave, coach Martinez. Said Braden can finish the season with another team. You can't kick us out, Karen shrieked. Actually, I can. It called protecting our Players Families from harassment. Dave was already dragging Karen toward their Tesla, muttering about lawsuits. Karen kept yelling over her shoulder about disability, body privilege and reverse ableism. The next day, Dave's video went viral on social media, but not the way they intended. The comments were universally horrifying them. Within 48 hours, Karen was fired from her job as a school administrator. Dave's law firm quietly suggested he take a sabbatical.

That's when his mother Karen materialized like a helicopter parent superhero. My son Braden asked you a simple question, she said, hands on her hips. The least you could do is let him try it for two minutes. I understand he's curious, but this is medical equipment. It's not safe for someone who doesn't need it. Karen's face flushed red. That's ridiculous. It's just a chair with wheels. Braden has good balance. Ma'am, this chair is calibrated for my specific medical needs. Are you seriously going to deny a child a simple request because you're gatekeeping your disability? She interrupted. That's discrimination against able bodied people. I blinked trying to process the backwards logic. This is literally my legs. Don't be dramatic, she snapped. You're sitting here doing nothing anyway. Braden would actually use it properly. He'd have fun with it instead of just taking up space. Other parents were starting to stare. Emma looked mortified from the field. The answer is no, this isn't a toy. That's when Karen completely lost it. Fine. She screamed loud enough for the entire.

I'm Mike and I have a four year old daughter named Ebony who has absolutely no filter. Last week we were at the grocery store when she made me want to crawl into a hole and disappear forever. We're standing in the checkout line behind this really tall black man who's probably 6 feet 5 inches and built like a basketball player. Ebony is staring at him with that intense kids stare that makes every parent nervous. I'm trying to distract her. Ebony, look at the magazine, look at the candy. But she's completely fixated on this guy. Finally she tugs on my shirt and says in her loudest four year old voice, daddy, why is that man so dark? The entire checkout line goes silent. I want to disappear into the floor. The man turns around with this patient smile that tells me he's dealt with curious kids before. Well, little one, that's just how god made me. Ebony nods seriously, then asks, God run out of the light color when he made you? I'm mortified, Ebony. That's not how. But the man starts laughing. You know what? Maybe he did or maybe he thought dark was more beautiful that day. Ebony considers this. I think you're right. Dark is prettier like chocolate. Thank you, sweetheart. I think we're in the clear. But Ebony is not done. Are you made of chocolate? No. Honey, I'm made of the same stuff you are, but you look like chocolate, the really good kind that mommy hides from me. The man is cracking up now. Well, I do love chocolate. Ebony gets it excited. Me, too. We have so much in common. I'm starting to relax, thinking maybe this isn't so bad. Then Ebony asks, can I lick you to see if you taste like chocolate? Ebony, the entire line bursts in to laughter. The man is doubled over. Sweetie, I don't taste like chocolate. I just look like it. Ebony looks disappointed. That's false advertising. False advertising? Yeah. Mommy says that's when something looks like one thing but it's really something else. Like when cereal boxes have more cereal on the picture than in the box. The man looks at me. Your daughter is very smart.

Jake brought his portable speaker, and we're picking grapes to 90s hip hop like it's some kind of twisted harvest party. Around midnight, we're halfway through row two when my mom starts giggling like a teenager. She's exhausted, but running on pure spite at this point. Maureen's gonna show up tomorrow, and there won't be a single grape left, she keeps saying between fits of laughter. By three a m, we've cleared three full rows, and we're all delirious. Ryan finds this one perfect cluster hanging way up high and makes this whole dramatic speech about it being the chosen grapes before Jake lifts him up to grab them. Sun's starting to come up, and we're on the final row. My dad's passed out in his lawn chair, but he picked for, like, four hours straight. The absolute legend. We're all covered in grape juice and dirt, looking like we survived some kind of agricultural apocalypse. At exactly 7 a m, we hear car doors slamming. Maureen's arrived with what sounds like her entire extended family. I'm hiding behind the fence with Emma, both of us trying not to laugh as we watch Maureen march toward the grapevines with her little army of relatives carrying baskets. Silence was beautiful. You could literally hear her jaw hit the ground when she saw the completely bare vines. Not a single grape left. We'd even gotten the tiny ones that weren't quite ripe yet just to be Extra petty, she starts screaming at my mom, demanding to know what happened to the grapes. My mom, still in her pajamas and covered in grape stains, just shrugs and says, oh, we decided to pick them after all. Maureen's nephew or whoever asks if we left any for them, and my mom points to this one Vine in the corner where there's literally three grapes hanging. Help yourselves, she says with the sweetest smile. Maureen's whole family starts arguing with her about driving all the way over here for nothing. Her daughter's like, mom, you said there would be tons of grapes! And some old dude, who's probably her husband, is complaining about his back hurting for no reason. They all pile back in their cars and leave without a single grape. Meanwhile, we've got enough grapes to make wine for the next five years. My mom spent the whole day making grape juice and calling relatives to give updates like she just won the World Series.

So my parents rent this house with a quarter acre of land, and the landlord lets us pick from these grape vines every year. There's this old lady, Maureen, who used to pick them before we moved in, and she's been nothing but trouble ever since. Every single year, it's the same drama. The landlord already told her we get first dibs because we actually pay rent. But Maureen acts like she owns the place. She's got her own grapes on her property, but apparently, that's not enough for her greedy ass. This year, my mom tells Maureen, we're picking this weekend. Simple enough, right? Wrong. My dad just had major cancer surgery and was still recovering. my mom's usual helper crew all got sick with some nasty stomach bug. So the weekend comes and goes without us getting to the grapes. Monday morning, my mom's phone rings. It's Maureen. And she's got this smug tone like she just won the lottery. She tells my mom that she's coming tomorrow with her whole family to pick all the grapes, since we apparently missed our chance. My mom tries to explain the situation. She's like, Maureen, please. My husband just had surgery for cancer, and everyone who helps me is sick. Can you just wait a few more days? And you know what this heartless witch says? That's too bad. You had your chance. My family is coming tomorrow, and we are picking the grapes. I'm sitting in the kitchen when my mom comes in, absolutely losing it. She's crying and yelling about how Maureen calls herself a Christian, but acts like Satan himself. She tells me the whole story, and I just snap, absolutely not. I tell her we're staying up all night if we have to. We're picking every single grape off those vines. Start calling everyone I know. My girlfriend Emma, my college buddies Jake and Ryan, my cousin Madison, even my mom's work friends. I'm like, emergency. Great mission. Be here by sunset. By 7 p m, we've got 10 people in our backyard looking like we're about to storm the beaches of Normandy. Except instead of machine guns, we got buckets and flashlights. My dad, even though he's supposed to be resting, hobbles out with his walker and grabs a bucket, too. We start with the first row closest to the house. The grapes are perfect. Fat and juicy.

He said if I claimed damage I didn't cause, I could get in serious trouble. Fines, maybe even criminal charges. He told me not to do it. I also posted about it online without details, and two people who said they were lawyers said the same thing. When Jenna came back three days later, I told her I couldn't do it. She started crying, saying she was going to have to declare bankruptcy. She kept saying it was just insurance and they have money and it wouldn't hurt anyone. I felt horrible, but I kept saying no. She got angry and said I was being selfish and that friends help each other. I told her I could help her find a payment plan with the building or maybe a lawyer, but I couldn't lie on an insurance claim. He left and didn't talk to me for two days. Then she showed up again. This time Ashley was with her. They both sat on my couch, and Ashley apologized for causing the whole mess. She said she felt terrible and knew it was her fault. Then Jenna started again about the insurance. She said the building gave her two weeks to pay $8,000 as a down payment or they would start legal action. She really did think she would go bankrupt. I looked at both of them and said I already talked to professionals and They all said this was fraud. I couldn't do it. Ashley got mad. Then she said I was letting Jenna's life get ruined over something that wouldn't even affect me. I asked how it wouldn't affect me if I committed fraud. She. I didn't have an answer. They both left, and Jenna didn't talk to me for another week. During that time, our whole friend group was weirdly quiet. I later found out Jenna had told everyone I was refusing to help her and made it sound like I was the bad guy. Finally, one of our mutual friends named Chris texted me asking what actually happened. I explained everything, including the fraud part. He said that made sense and he didn't blame me. Apparently, Ashley's parents ended up giving her money to pay for half the damage, and Jenna got a payment plan with the building for the rest. She didn't go bankrupt. She didn't even miss any rent payments. But she never apologized to me for asking me to commit fraud twice.

My friend Jenna and I both moved into the same building after college. She got the fourth floor and I got the third one. Saturday morning, she texted our whole friend group saying she wanted to do a rooftop barbecue. She had done these before, but I never went because I don't eat red meat. This time I figured I should actually show up. So I grabbed chips and paper plates from the store. The barbecue was nice. Everyone was drinking and laughing. Our friend Ashley brought this huge grill and cooked burgers and hot dogs for everyone. I just ate the chips I brought and hung out. Around 9 at night, we all went down to Jenna's apartment to watch some reality show about people stuck on an island. Before we left the roof, Jenna and Ashley talked about leaving the grill up there to cool down overnight. They said they would grab it tomorrow. Made sense to me, so I didn't think about it. The show ended around midnight and I went back to my apartment and crashed. The next morning, I woke up to this long email from building management. There was a fire on the roof last night. Someone had dumped hot coals into the plastic trash can up there and the wind made them catch fire again. The email said they had camera footage and key card records and they knew exactly who was responsible. Screenshot The email and sent it to Jenna. She immediately called me freaking out. Apparently after I left, she and Ashley decided to take the grill home that same night. Instead of waiting, Jenna gave Ashley her keys to go up and get it. Ashley thought the coals were cool enough so she just dumped them in the trash can on the roof. The building was saying Jenna was responsible because it was her guest using her key card. The email said the damage was around $15,000. New roof section, new trash area, new door because the smoke messed up the sensors. A week went by and Jenna came to my apartment. She looked terrible, like she hadn't been sleeping. She asked if I could claim the fire damage on my renters insurance. I was confused at first. She explained that neither her nor Ashley had renters insurance and the building was threatening to sue her. She said if I claimed it on mine, we could just say I was up there, too and it would all go away. I told her I needed to think about it. I called my old insurance agent from when I lived with my parents. He was this older guy who always gave me good advice. I explained the whole situation.

I was 13 when I heard my mom tell her friend Linda that having three kids was her biggest regret. They were drinking wine on the patio. Thought I was at basketball practice. But coach canceled, so I came home early. If I could do it over, I'd stop at one, my mom said, laughing like it was funny. Maybe two. But three? That broke me. I'm the third kid. I stood behind the sliding door, basketball still under my arm, listening to my mother explained how I ruined her life. How she was finally getting her career back after my sister. Then my brother came along and set her back again. But she managed. Then I happened. Birth control failure. She called me like I was a defective product. Linda asked which kid she'd keep if she had to choose. My mom didn't even hesitate. Sophia, obviously. She's going to Yale next year. Pure genius, that one. What about the boys? Tyler. Sweet. Good at sports. Easy kid. She took another sip. But Ryan, he's just there. Doesn't excel at anything. Mediocre grades. No real talent. Sometimes I look at him and think, what's the point? What's the point of me, her son? I went to my room and didn't come out for dinner. When my dad knocked, I pretended to be asleep. But I wasn't sleeping. I was replaying every moment that suddenly made sense. Why my baby? Pictures stopped after age 2. Why? Sophia got a car for her 16th birthday. Tyler got a motorcycle for his, and I got a used bike from Craigslist. Why? They went to every one of Tyler's football games. I couldn't remember when my art show was. The next morning, I tested something. I told them I needed money for a field trip. $20. Ask your father, mom said. Without looking up from her phone. Ask your mother, dad said. From behind his newspaper. Tyler walked in. Hey, I need new cleats. How much? Mom immediately asked. Like, 80 bucks. She pulled out her wallet. Here's 100. Get good ones. I stopped asking for things after that. Two months later, report cards came out. I got straight b's. Best ever. I was so proud. Worked really hard for those grades. Left it on the kitchen counter where they'd see it. It sat there for a week, untouched. Tyler brought home a C plus in English. Mom hired him a tutor that same day. We can't let your grades slip, honey. You've got scholarships to think about. But the moment that broke me. My 14th birthday. They forgot. Not like they got the date wrong. They literally forgot I existed. That day, Sophia was visiting from college. Tyler had a game. They all went out to celebrate his winning touchdown. Posted family photos on Facebook. So proud of our kids. The caption read, I was.

My uncle told me buy old muscle cars and fix them up for cheap. There's only so many left and you'll get more car for your money than any new ride. When I was 22, I just landed my first decent job at a tech startup and got approved for a loan on a brand new luxury sedan. Everyone my age was driving German cars, showing off their success with monthly payments they could barely afford. But pulled me aside at a family barbecue. Uncle wasn't the type to talk much, but he always had some cool old car project going, so I figured he knew what he was talking about. I followed him over to his garage and watched him point at a beat up muscle car covered in a tarp. He explained that pile of rust cost me $2,000 in 1995, sold it last month for $140,000. Your fancy new car will be worth half what you pay the moment you drive it off the lot. These old beauties only go up if you know what you're doing. That conversation stuck with me for weeks, thinking about what uncle said while I was looking at all these shiny new cars at the dealership. Finally, I called them up and cancelled my loan approval. Instead of putting money down on a luxury sedan, I started hunting for old muscle cars I could actually afford to buy and fix up Within two months, I bought three rusted out classics from the late 60s. There was a Camaro that wouldn't start, a Corvette with a blown engine and a Chevelle that looked like it had been sitting in a field for decades. Parents were mortified when neighbors started complaining about the junkyard in our driveway. My friends thought I'd lost my mind. Every time we hung out, they wouldn't shut up about their new rides. They'd show off their leather seats and touch screens while roasting my cars. One friend laughed and said I'd never get any girls driving rust buckets like that, only cougars who were into vintage stuff. Another kept saying I looked like I was collecting scrap metal, not chicks brag about their heated seats and backup cameras, then joke that the only feature my cars had was breaking down. I'll admit there were moments pulling up next to their shiny Bmws that I wondered if uncle was wrong. But then I'd remember that 140,000 dollar sale and I stayed determined to prove them all wrong. For four years, I spent nights and weekends in Uncle's garage learning how to fix these things, welded engine work, paint, whatever I needed to know, started hitting up car auctions to see what stuff was actually worth. My social life pretty much ended because they all thought I was too broke to hang out with them. So while my friends were posting pics of their fancy interiors and complaining about 1,400 Monthly payments, I was covered in grease trying to get these rust buckets running. Slowly, I started recognizing patterns and what collectors wanted. The models I bought weren't just any old cars. They were the specific ones that were getting harder and harder

Mom's only got one kid worth talking about, my brother Mike, 22. I put myself through college, have a career. But mom only talks about Mike's games. Dad never stood up to her. Grandpa Joe was the only one who called it out, said it to Mom's face during Christmas. She didn't talk to him for months. My grandparents set up a college fund for me after a house fire. Mom said it got used for repairs. Years later, I Learned the truth. Big chunk went to Mike's car, another to his apartment. When I graduated, Grandpa Joe mailed me a letter with $100. Every man deserves a cold drink after walking the stage. I met Nora in college, freshman year. My parents visited campus once for Mike's game, didn't call me. Last year, Mike posted on Instagram caption, some of us chase real goals. Some of us just sit behind desks, pretend tending to be important. Guess which one mom brags about? Mom liked it. When Nora and I got engaged, I called my parents. Mom said, oh, that's nice. Then talked about Mike's tournament. Around summer, I found out they paid for Mike's sports agent and private training, used what was left of the Fund. We picked October 14th for the wedding. I texted my parents, I've got an important event. Dates October 14th. Would love for you to be there. Mom replied, that's Mike's last regular season game. We'll be there supporting him. I didn't add details. If they cared, they'd ask. They didn't. Grandpa Joe asked. I told him. He said he'd be there. My parents never asked. October 14th came. Wedding at Nora's aunt's place. Grandpa Joe walked me to the altar. When we were declared married, everyone cheered. During photos, someone asked where my parents were. I said, Mike had a game. Grandpa Joe sighed, they're going to regret this. Kendall posted photos on Facebook, caption, beautiful day celebrating Sam and Nora. Some folks chose other priorities. That line set everything off. We left the next morning for our honeymoon, a week, no phones. When we got back, notifications exploded. Aunt Kendall's post had spread through our parents community.

I decided to name my son Leonardo to honor my late childhood best friend who passed a couple of years ago. Everyone at the shower thought it was sweet, except my sister Casey, who stood up and slammed her palms on the table when she heard the name. That's my baby name. You know how much I love Leonardo DiCaprio and plan to name my baby that. We tried to tell Casey she wasn't even in a relationship, much less pregnant, but she wasn't having it. She yelled that we were traitors, then packed her things and left with an announcement. See you all in court. Two days later, I got a letter in the mail giving me 24 hours to relinquish the name or face consequences. My family called an emergency intervention. We all sat down with Casey and Mom's living room that evening. Try gently explaining why I wouldn't be giving up a name. Casey's face was like an angry tomato. She kept interrupting to tell me how my dead friend would understand, how this has been her only dream in life ever since she was a little girl. We stood our ground, and after proving to her through one of my lawyer friends that she couldn't go to court over a baby name, she ended up giving us an ultimatum. The name was hers or she got no contact with us. We all Simultaneously pointed at the door. Her eyes went when we called the bluff. And in this angry, defeated tone, she said, fine, you can have the stupid name. We thought that was it, because we didn't hear from her at all for the next three months. But then my Labor Day came. I was literally giving birth when Casey burst through the door, holding a teddy bear and shouting, Michael is here! Our whole family, including the nurses, looked confused. My husband Samuel asked what she meant. That's when Casey beamed and rubbed her flat stomach. I'm pregnant, too. You said I couldn't have the name because I wasn't pregnant. So I went out and became pregnant. Problem solved. We stared at her like she had five heads. Security removed her while she screamed about fairness. An hour later, I was holding my son for the first time. A nurse came in looking uncomfortable. There's been an issue with your paperwork. It says here the baby's name is Michael. My husband jumped up like a hawk. He investigated while I held Leonardo, and found out the hospital documents were different from what we submitted. Casey had actually tried to officially change our baby's name while I was in active labor. The hospital fixed it, but the message was done. Casey was determined. The next morning, while we were still recovering, my brother called. Casey's at the hospital. She's hurt really badly. Turns out Casey had woken up at 5:00am and had Been filing name claims, then driving to every courthouse in the entire state trying to get someone to legally grant her the name Leonardo. She barely slept and spent all day without eating and drinking, leading to her being so tired and dehydrated that she suffered a sunstroke. Before collapsing on the courthouse steps. She fell straight onto her belly and started miscarrying. I was rushed to the nearest hospital, where they had to IV fluids and nutrients into her. The moment she was lucid again, she called me directly from the hospital, yelling that I called her baby by forcing her to fight for what was rightly hers. Leonardo was mine, she sobbed. How does it feel to know an innocent baby is dead because of you? I hung up without responding. Three weeks later, I was breastfeed when Samuel's phone rang. It was Child Protective Services. Someone had reported us for child abuse and neglect. The case worker rattled off allegations that made my blood run cold. Samuel was apparently violent towards the baby. His juvenile record from a bar fight when he was 17 was cited. My dad, who lived with us, was also mentioned as a threat. His old teaching scandal, where a student accused him of inappropriate behavior before admitting she lied, was also cited. They even mentioned the house being unsafe for a Newborn. While we were still reeling from the call, my neighbor texted me screenshots from our local Facebook group. Casey had Written this long post about making the brave decision to report abuse she'd witnessed going on in our home. Painting herself as a hero saving a baby from danger. Twenty minutes later, I let the workers, thinking seeing our clean house would end this nightmare. The case worker checked the nursery, the baby supplies, Leonardo sleeping peacefully.

We've been separated for three weeks. When she texted me at midnight, can we talk just once face to face? I ignored it. Then she sent another, please. I won't beg. I just need to see you. Against my better judgment, I agreed to meet at the house while the kids were at school. I figured she wanted to discuss custody or divide up the bank accounts, maybe finally sign the papers her lawyer kept threatening to file. I walked in expecting her to be cold, old, distant. Instead, she'd clean the entire house. There were fresh flowers on the kitchen table, the expensive ones from that boutique she always said were too pricey. And sitting on the counter was a bottle of Jameson, the 18 year Reserve, my favorite whiskey we banned from our home six years ago after I came home drunk from my buddy's bachelor party. It's for you, she said, barely making eye contact. If you come home, you can drink whatever you want whenever you want. I was wrong about that rule. I told her this wasn't about alcohol. We both knew that our problems ran deeper than house rules. Her hands were shaking as she poured herself water. Then what is it about? Because I need to know. I need to fix it. Tell me what to fix. I explained that some things can't be fixed with grand gestures, that we've Been broken for years and just refused to admit it, that the separation actually felt like relief. That's when her voice cracked. So there's nothing, nothing I can do. I stayed quiet. She started listing things, desperate things. I could go out with my friends anytime I wanted. No more asking permission or guilt trips. I could have my own space in the house, convert the spare room into whatever I wanted. She'd stop complaining about my family visiting every weekend. She'd stop nagging about the dish is, about my job, about everything. I just stood there watching my wife of 12 years unravel in front of me. What if. She paused, took a shaky breath. What if you could do whatever you wanted, see whoever you wanted? And I just, I wouldn't ask questions. I asked her what she meant. I needed to hear her say it. I mean, her eyes filled with tears. I mean, if you wanted to be with someone else, I wouldn't stop you. You could go out, meet people, do whatever make.

So I'm 27 and I've been stuck with this friend group since college. There's like eight of us total, but two people in particular, Susan and Greg, are straight up parasites. Every single time we go out to eat, they pull the same garbage move. They'll order the most expensive thing on the menu, then suddenly they're broke and need everyone else to cover them. It's been going on for years and I'm so sick of it. Like last month, we went to this steakhouse and Greg ordered a 60 dollar rib eye plus appetizers and drinks. When the check came, he goes, oh, man, rent was due this week. Can you guys help me out? We all ended up paying like $20 extra just for his meal. Susan does the exact same thing every time. So last weekend, my friend Dan texts me about this casual dinner at some restaurant downtown. I immediately tell him that if Susan and Greg are gonna be there, count me out. But Dan keeps pushing me to come, saying I should just put my feelings aside for once and join the group. Against my better judgment, I agree to go. I show up and there's six of us total. We're all talking and catching up and then everyone starts ordering. Most people get stuff around $40, which is pretty normal for this place. Then Susan and Greg's turn comes up. Susan orders this lobster dish that's like $95 plus she gets an appetizer and expensive wine. Greg gets surf and turf for $120 plus drinks. I'm watching this happen and I already know what's coming next. When the waiter gets to me, everyone's looking at me expectantly. I pick up the menu, scan it for like two seconds, point to the 4 or Miller Light and tell the waiter that's all I want. Dan immediately goes, dude, why aren't you eating anything? I just shrug and say I lost my appetite. Two other friends at the table look at each other, then flag down the waiter to cancel their food orders, too. They just got drinks instead. The whole dinner was awkward after that. Susan and Greg are eating their fancy meals while half the table is just sipping beer. I could tell they were getting nervous because they kept picking at their food instead of actually eating it. And the check comes. The total was insane because of their expensive orders. Greg immediately grabs the waiter and goes, can you split this six ways? Without even asking anyone, I stand up and correct him. Actually split it three ways. Three of us only had drinks. Greg looks at me all confused and go.

We need to act immediately, dad said, dropping a purchase agreement on my workbench. This saves the family, saves him, I corrected. Bianca begged. He made a mistake. You can't let him go to prison. He made a series of choices. Their lawyer cleared his throat. You have a clear familial obligation. The property is deed to you, was deed to me. Past. Elise stepped forward. Two years ago, this property was transferred to an LLC as a corporate asset. Wade is the founder and majority owner. The land belongs to his corporation. Dead silence. What company? Reid's face went completely white. I pulled out his hedge funds financial filing. The coding company you shorted. You bet over a million of your clients money that it was a scam. You were so convinced your welder brother in law couldn't build something real that you staked everything on my failure. When it didn't fail, you lost everything. You destroyed yourself betting against me. Bianca collapsed to the floor sobbing. You were supposed to be the one who needed us. Our lawyer walked in right on time. Your demand letter is legally worthless. Furthermore, there's evidence Mister Reid misrepresented his position to investors, told them it was insider information when it was arrogance. That's security's fraud. I haven't turned this over to the SEC yet. Their lawyer was already packing his briefcase. They left broken. Three months later, I signed Acquisition papers in a conference room surrounded by lawyers and executives. Major industrial manufacturer wanted my patents and process. The number on the purchase agreement, $22 million with the condition I'd stay on for three years as head of R&D to keep developing applications. The money hit my account the next day, more than my father had made in his entire career. From a metal shop he called a hobby, my father showed up alone weeks later. I made a mistake. I'm sorry I didn't see it sooner. You don't get to apologize now that there's money involved. You don't, don't get to be proud of me now. That's not how it works. What can I do? Nothing. Leave. I'd spent 30 years trying to earn their approval. I was done. I'd proven everything I needed to prove, not to them, but to myself.

Nine years later, they showed up, demanding I fix her life. I was 8 when my parents sat me down for a family meeting. My sister Victoria, 6 years old, had just been diagnosed with leukemia. Dad did most of the talking while mom cried. They needed to focus on Victoria. It would be better if I went to stay with Uncle Frank, just until Victoria gets better. Mom added that that while lasted nine years. The day they dropped me off is burned into my memory. Four hour drive, mom crying. I sat in the back with a duffel bag and my stuffed Dinosaur, trying to figure out what I'd done wrong. Uncle Frank met us at the door. Tall guy with callous hands. Hey, Buddy, got a project car in the garage. My parents stayed 30 minutes, then they were gone. Uncle Frank raised me, went to every parent teacher conference, helped with homework, taught me to change oil, use tool, balance a checkbook. Made dinner every night. My parents called once a month, always about Victoria, her treatments, her prognosis. Never asked about my school or friends. I made honor roll when I was 10. Brought my report card to dinner during one of their rare visits. Mom glanced at it. That's nice, honey. Then immediately started talking about Victoria's treatment. Uncle Frank saw my face fall. Later, he took me for ice cream. Made a huge deal about it. Put that report card on his fridge with 50 magnets. That's when I understood the difference between parents and family. Victoria went into remission when I was 11. I thought they'd come get me. They didn't. We need to make sure she stays stable, dad explained. Victoria relapsed when I was 14. My parents called Uncle Frank directly. Didn't even ask to talk to me. He looked at me, asked if I wanted to talk to them. I shook my head. Victoria beat cancer when I was 16. They visited with her. She'd been six when I left. Now she was 14. Complete strangers over dinner. They dropped their bomb. They wanted me to come home. Can I think about it? I asked. Dad's face hardened. What's there to think about? You're our son. Uncle Frank spoke up. Let the kid finish high school here. They agreed, then reminded me about coming home for college. I didn't mention I'd already been looking at schools near Uncle Frank's house. Senior year was great. Robotics team won regionals, got accepted to Riverside Tech with a scholarship. When I told my parents, they lost their minds. We've already sacrificed enough time with you. I'm going to Riverside Tech. Already paid my deposit. Dad started yelling about being selfish. I hung up. I graduated, got hired at a great firm, bought my own place. Then last month, mom called. Victoria is struggling. Can't find work. Living at home. With depression. We thought you could help. She looks up to you. I laughed. She doesn't even know me. You're her brother. She needs family support. Biologically, I'm her brother. That's where it ends. Mom's voice got sharp. She almost died. Show some compassion. You did everything for her. Nothing for me. Except ship me off when I became inconvenient. We didn't have a choice. You had choices. You chose her. Every single time dad grabbed the phone and started yelling

When his investments collapsed, my parents demanded I sell my shop to bail them out. I let them rant, then revealed something that made their jaws drop. I'm Wade, 32. I run a metal fabrication shop. My family spent 30 years treating me like I couldn't cut it because as I chose welding over Wall Street. Five years ago, I married a lease under the oak tree on my grandmother's land. Hay bails for seats, wildflowers, barbecue. My crew wore work boots perfect. My family treated it like community service. Dad checked his watch constantly. My sister Bianca and husband Reed dressed for a Forbes gala. Then came Reed's speech. When Bianca told me her brother was getting married, I thought she was joking. I figured his one true relationship was with his welding torch. His buddies laughed. Some of us were born to build empires. Society needs both, right? Someone's got to make the fixtures. Bianca added, I could never give up my spa appointments, but I admire your commitment to simplicity. What they didn't know, for six years, I've been developing a chemical coating for metal. Make steel stronger, rust proof, safe. After four years of failures, I cracked it, filed four patents, started an LLC, kept it quiet while Reid bought a mansion and Bianca turned influencer. My company hit $3.8 million, then $8.2 million. We still drove our old Trucks, nothing changed outside. Reid, meanwhile, quit his corporate job to start a hedge fund, made aggressive plays. Dad talked about him like he'd invented capitalism. One night, Reid cornered me at their housewarming. Good for you, man. Honest work. Someone's got to make the stuff we put in our offices. And my cousin called. Reid's in serious trouble. Lost everything, his clients, money. There's talk of fraud charges. Your parents are coming for you. Days later, a legal threat arrived. I was expected to sell my property to resolve Reid's emergency. I called our lawyer. He laughed when we explained everything, including the detail. At least discovered Reed had been running a hedge fund and his biggest position was shorting my coding company, the one I owned. Reed bet over $1 million that I would fail. When my company succeeded, his entire position blew up. He destroyed himself betting against me. The deadline passed. Monday morning, three cars pulled up. Dad, mom.

I worked it support at a health insurance company in Dallas processing claims eight hours a day. My desk was next to this guy who'd been there 15 years doing the exact same job. Everyone thought he was just coasting until retirement. He came in at 9, left at five, never worked overtime, never volunteered for projects. Meanwhile, the rest of us were drowning, staying late every night trying to hit our quotas of 50 processed claims per day. This guy, I would finish his 50 claims by lunch, then spend the rest of his shift watching YouTube with his headphones in. Management loved him because he always hit his numbers exactly, never more, never less, just 50 claims every single day for 15 years straight. One Friday, I was stuck on a claim that wouldn't process. The system kept rejecting it and I'd already burned 45 minutes trying and to figure out why. He noticed me getting frustrated, pulled out one earbud and said he could take a look. I slid my keyboard over and he fixed it in 8 seconds flat. I asked how he did that so fast. He drug and said the system has patterns. Once you learn them, it gets easier. I pressed him on it because 8 seconds was insane. He looked around the office to make sure nobody was listening. Then he finally admitted something. He wasn't actually processing claims manually anymore. About six years ago, he'd written a Python script that automated the entire process. The script would pull claims from the queue, verify all the information against our database, cross reference with provider networks, check for errors and submit it approved claims automatically. But here's where it got crazy. He programmed it to only process exactly 50 claims per day and to do it slowly throughout the shift so it looked like he was working at a normal human pace. He even added random delays between claims to make it seem more realistic. The script would finish everything by noon and it's and the rest of every day doing whatever he wanted. I just stared at him trying to process what he just told me. I asked why he never told management or tried to get promoted with skills like that. He looked at me like I was the dumbest person alive. He said he makes $58,000 a year doing essentially nothing.

I built it myself on my own time. When our main competitor acquired my startup for nine figures, my old director was silent in the board meeting. I spent six months building an AI forecasting tool that could predict sales trends better than anything our company had. When I finally pitched it to the board, my director, Robert, literally laughed in my face. We don't risk money on fantasies, he said. Like I had suggested, we invest in unicorn farms. The humiliation burned. Everyone in that conference room stared at their coffee cups while Robert dismissed my work like it meant nothing. Someone from finance even coughed into his sleeve to avoid looking at me. I packed up my presentation, smiled politely, and left. That night, I decided I would build it anyway. I worked every night after my regular job. My laptop was ancient and wheezed like it was dying, but I didn't care. I made a separate email account, used free design tools, and made sure nothing touched my work computer. I was paranoid about the company finding out, I tracked every penny I spent. Server hosting a new keyboard when mine snapped in half, take out food during late night coding sessions. My savings took a hit, but I felt more alive than I had in years. Three months later, I had a working prototype. I called it Forecast Genius and put it Online with zero. No personal information. Just a simple demo anyone could try. Within hours, a small bookstore in Denver signed up and emailed me. This is better than what we pay shopify for. I read that message 10 times. Then more users found me. A guy with four gas stations in Texas, pet supply store in Seattle, a wine distributor in Pennsylvania. They all said the same thing. My tool worked, and it was cheaper than anything else out there. A community formed around it. Users shared tips, requested features, and cheered each other on. Meanwhile, at work, our company paid $2 million for a state of the art forecasting system from a consulting firm. It was garbage. It kept missing predictions and making everyone's job harder.

You treated me like I was nothing, like I existed just to be your verbal punching bag. Mark voice was shaking. I'm done being treated like a joke by my own son. I'm done. Aiden's face went pale. Dad, I'm sorry. Mark looked at him. Tell me you're sorry. Actually sorry in your own words. No internet speak, just you. Aiden opened his mouth, closed it. I'm my bad, bro. Mark's face crumpled. Aiden tried again. I messed up. I took an L. I should have. He stopped, tried to find real words. They wouldn't come. Every apology came wrapped in memes. Mark looked at me, eyes wet. He can't even do it. He can't talk to me like a human being. He turned back to Aiden. I'll come back when you can speak to me like I'm your father. Instead of a comment section, Mark walked away. Back toward the cabins. Aiden stood there. For the first time in a year, he had nothing to say. Mark's been gone a year and Aiden just graduated high school. At the ceremony, the principal asked where his father Was Aiden said he went to get milk and for the first time in his life, nobody laughed.

My son Aiden is 16 and I don't know when I lost him to the internet. It happened slowly. First, it was just the occasional bet or no cap thrown into normal sentences. Then it was the constant phone checking, the TikTok references I didn't understand. Now every conversation sounds like a comment section argument. My husband Mark tries. He really does. He asks Aiden about school, about his friends, about what he's interested in. Aiden responds in half sentences peppered with words I have to Google later ratio mid. It's giving cringe l take dad. Mark will say something about his day at work and Aiden will say, didn't ask without even looking up from his phone. When Mark tries to explain something, Aiden interrupts with schizo post F r, F r. I keep telling Mark it's just a phase. All teenagers go through rebellion. This is just what it looks like now. But I can see it wearing on him. The way his shoulders slump when Aiden, this is him, the way he stopped trying to share things. At dinner last week, Mark mentioned he got a promotion. Aiden said, who asked though? And went back to scrolling. Mark just sat there looking at his plate. I don't think this is just a phase anymore. Friday night, family dinner, I made Mark's favorite chicken Parmesan. Thought maybe a nice meal. Would help. Mark came home from work looking tired, sat down at the Abel, tried to smile. How was everyone's day? Aiden didn't look up from his phone. Mid Mark tried again. I finished that big project today, the one I've been working on for six months. Didn't ask Aiden, your father is talking to you. I kept my voice calm. Aiden looked up. Your mom is talking to me. Mark's jaw tightened, but he kept going. I was thinking maybe this weekend we could. Your mom was thinking what? Your mom could. Aiden's face was blank like he was reading off a teleprompter. Mark set down his fork. Can you stop? Your mom can stop. Aiden, I'm trying to have a conversation with you. Your mom's trying to have a conversation with you. I can see Mark's face getting red. That doesn't even make sense. I'm talking about my weekend plans. Your mom's talking about your weekend plans. Stop. Your mom should stop it. Mark's hands were shaking. He took a breath, tried a different approach, started talking about something he'd seen on the news. Aiden waited exactly three seconds. Your mom saw that on the news. Every sentence, every attempt. Your mom, your mom, your mom. Like a glitch, like Aiden had forgotten how to respond any other way. Mark looked at me desperate. I tried Aiden enough. This isn't funny. Your mom isn't funny. Mark stood up so fast his chair scraped across.

The man looked satisfied. Leah reached for me. Please let me explain. I did get it annulled. I have the papers at home. Then why didn't you tell me? My voice came out louder than I meant. Four years together, and you never mentioned you got married in Vegas. Because it didn't matter. It was annulled. The man pulled out more papers. No annulment was filed. I've checked with Nevada. We're still legally married. Leah's face crumbled. That's not possible, the lawyer said. What lawyer? You never hired one. One of my groomsmen pulled out his phone. I'm calling the police. Two police officers arrived and separated everyone. One approached the man, the other came to us. Can someone explain what's happening? Leah pulled out her phone. We had a drunken wedding in Vegas three years ago. I got it annulled three months later. Here. Annulment documents. Court stamps. The officer looked them over, then showed his partner. They made phone calls. The man was arguing with the other officer. After 15 minutes, one officer came back. Ma'am, your annulment checks out. You're not legally married to him. Relief washed over me. Leah started crying harder. The officer wasn't done. Do you know an Eric Duperts? Leah's expression changed immediately. Fear? Yes. He's been stalking me for two years. I have a restraining order. He's violated it six times. The officer's expression hardened. He walked to his partner. They both looked at the man. Second Officer pulled out handcuffs. Mr. Duperts, you're under arrest for violating a restraining order. The man's face went from confident to panic. What? No. She married me. Sir, the annulment is legal. You've been served with a restraining order. You just violated it in front of 200 witnesses. They puffed him. He was yelling as they dragged him out. She took everything from me. She can't just disappear. The chapel fell silent. Leah was shaking. I put my arm around her. You have a stalker? She nodded. It's a long story. In the bridal suite, Leah explained through tears. The Vegas ceremony was a drunken mistake during her bachelorette party. She got it annulled three months later. Eric Dupre's had convinced her it was real love that night. And when she annulled it, he became obsessed. Claimed she destroyed his life, owed him money. He'd been stalking her for two years, despite the restraining order. Moved states following her. Found her jobs and showed up. Threatened her family. She kept it secret because she was ashamed and scared. I asked why she didn't tell me. She said, because he ruins everything I try to build. I didn't want him to ruin us, too. I held her while she cried. Then I asked if she still wanted to get married. She said yes. So we did. Right there with just the efficient and our parents. No crowd for him to disrupt ever again.

My brother Kevin and I made a pact when we were teenagers, the kind of dark humor only siblings share. We were watching our dad mow the lawn one Saturday afternoon when Kevin said, when I die, I want them to play Celebration at my funeral. Really confuse everyone. Then he get serious. Actually, if any of us ever play Celebration at a funeral, it means something's really wrong, like emergency level wrong. I asked why we need a signal like that and he shrugged. Weird things happen. If you hear that song at a funeral, you'll know someone needs help. We shook on it and never brought it up again. Twenty years later, dad collapsed at work and got diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. The doctors gave him three months, maybe four. Kevin's wife, Nicole was a hospice nurse and when she offered to coordinate Dad's care, my parents were relieved. Nicole set up the hospital bed, created medication schedules and helped my parents understand the medical terminology. I lived two states away and could only visit on weekends. So knowing Nicole was handling everything gave me peace of mind. Dad was still himself at first, still cracking jokes and insisting he'd beat this. And the pain got worse and the morphine increased. Dad started sleeping more, fading in and out. Nicole said this was Normal progression. When dad died six weeks after diagnosis, we were heartbroken but not surprised. The doctor said sometimes it happens faster than expected. At the funeral home, when the director asked about music, Kevin stared at the table for a long moment before saying quietly for the closing song. I want Celebration by cool and the gang, my heart stopped. Paul touched his shoulder gently. Honey, maybe something more traditional. Your father loved classical music. Kevin blinked like he was coming out of a fog. Yeah, you're right. Whatever you think, but I'd already heard it. The signal. I caught him alone afterward. Why did you request that song? He looked exhausted. I don't know. My brain isn't working right, Kevin. That was our signal. He stared at me blankly. What signal? Something about his empty expression bothered me. I kept thinking about how fast dad had declined. Twice when they'd said three or four months. I called the hospice doctor. Is it normal for pancreatic cancer to progress that quickly? It can be. Your father's care was managed appropriately, according to the notes I received from his home nurse. I looked through Dad's medication logs at my parents house. Every dose documented, timed, signed. The morphine had been increased three times in the final two weeks. Increase noted with per hospice doctor recommendation. It look professional and thorough. I texted Kevin asking to talk. Nicole answered his phone. He's resting. I gave him something to help him sleep. You gave him something. He's having a breakdown and needs medication. I'm his wife and a medical professional. She hung up. I drove to Kevin's house and didn't bother knocking, just tried the door. It was unlocked. Kevin was sitting on the couch with unfocused eyes. Kevin, what did she give you? He tried to focus. I don't. No. She said it would help. Nicole walked in and stopped when she saw me. What did you give him? Anxiety medication prescribed by his doctor. Show me the bottle. She pulled out a prescription bottle. Lorazepam prescribed to Nicole, not Kevin. This is your medication. I'm sharing it with my husband who needs it. He requested that song before you started drugging him. Her face changed. I'm helping him cope. He was trying to tell me something and now you're keeping him quiet. I pulled out my phone with photos of Dad's medication logs. The morphine increases. Walk me through them. She glanced at the pages. The hospice doctor approved every increase. But you requested them based on Dad's pain levels. I was there two days before he died. He wasn't in severe pain. Pain can be internal. You're not a medical professional. Neither was the.

Ten years later, I'm a doctor. They showed up asking for help with medical bills. I handed them his demo CD. I was 18 when my mom sat me down spring of senior year. We need to talk about college, she said in that fake sweet voice. I thought we were discussing dorm assignments. We've decided to redirect your college fund toward Trevor's career development. I stared at her. What do you mean redirect? Trevor got into Juilliard summer program. This is his shot, Gwen. That college fund was $85,000 from my dead father, money specifically left for my education. But my stepdad, Gary, convinced mom that Trevor was the family's golden ticket. You can take out student loans like everyone else, Gary said. Character building, Trevor's artistic window is closing. Trevor was 20, never held a job. His biggest accomplishment was chorus member No. 3 in Oklahoma. One successful Broadway show and he'll be set for life. Gary kept saying doctors are a dime a dozen. This from a guy who managed an oil change shop. They'd already started transferring the money before telling me. When Trevor found out, he didn't apologize. He smiled and said, when I make it big, I'll help pay for your medical school. Think of this as an investment. That summer, while Trevor posted Instagram stories from overpriced cafes, I worked double shifts applying for every scholarship I could find. I Got into medical school but without family support. I worked three jobs, overnight diner shifts, two during organic chemistry, medical scribe work. I lived on day old muffins and vending machine coffee. Trevor's New York updates got vaguer. The breakthrough never came. After burning through my inheritance in three years, he moved back home. He was 23, broke, living in his childhood bedroom. I graduated with $250,000 in debt. Trevor graduated to working part time at a music store. I finished medical school with honours, completed residency, opened my practice, finally making real money. Trevor was 31, still in that bedroom posting about upcoming projects that never materialized. Then the call came. Gary had a heart attack, mom sobbed. He needs surgery, multiple bypasses. Looking at $200,000 in medical bills. Gary's insurance was catastrophic only they had no savings. Most went to Trevor's career development. Maybe since you're a doctor, mom said, you could help us figure out payment plans. I remember that diner at 2:00am studying while serving drunk students, eating ramen three nights a week, crushing stress while Trevor posted from expensive restaurants. I'll think about it next morning. I drove to my childhood home. Trevor answered at 11:00am looking like he just woken up. What are you doing to help with the medical bills? He looked confused. I'm working at a music store. I don't have medical Bill money. You could get a second job, maybe one that uses that expensive training they paid for. I'm still pursuing My music career, I can't abandon.

I slept in a bus station bathroom that night. I cut contact and never looked back until last month when a baby shower invite arrived with a handwritten note from my mother. My dad didn't even look at me when he said it, just gripped the steering wheel and muttered, you're old enough, figure it out. The van pulled away, no bag, no phone, just me and $5. That night, I slept curled up in a Greyhound station bathroom stall. A janitor found me two days later. Social services got involved, but my parents convinced everyone I was a runaway seeking attention. After two months in a group home, they sent me back with a warning. I was their scapegoat. My younger sister, Daisy, golden child. She could throw tantrums. In church, they'd call her spirited. I spilled milk, cold stairs and silent treatment for days. By 16, I was working under the table at a diner, hiding cash behind a loose tile in my closet. Every dollar I saved felt like a brick in the wall between me and them. The day I turned 18, I left no note, just packed what little I had and took bus three towns over nine years of silence, I blocked them, changed my number, rebuilt my life from nothing. I thought I was free. Then the invitation arrived, soft pastels, a cartoon stork Join us to celebrate baby Dawson. And tucked behind it, a note in my mother's handwriting. Nathan, we'd really love to see you again. It's time to put the past behind us. Family should stick together, mom. I didn't respond, but I started digging. Daisy's Instagram was a pastel nightmare of blessed hashtags and nursery tours. Then I saw my mom's comment. You've always been our shining light. That's when it all clicked. A week later, another letter. My dad's messy scrawl, stop being selfish. Your sister needs you. Show up or don't bother coming back. Then the real bombshell hit. I accidentally got C C on an email from their lawyer. It was their will. Every asset, every account left Daisy at the bottom. Our son, Nathaniel has been estranged for many years and has made it clear he wants no relationship with this family. They were erasing me legally. But that wasn't all. A friend in cyber security helped me dig deeper. What I found made my blood freeze. Bank statements showing a trust fund in my name that I never knew existed. My grandmother had left money for both of us. Mine had been drained over years for educational expenses. I never went to college. I never saw a cent. They'd stolen over $47,000. Then I found the spreadsheets literally titled estrangement strategy and PR planning. Nathaniel, see, they planned my removal, documented it, branded me as the troubled black sheep who abandoned them. My mother had Even told their church I stole money before disappearing. That's when Daisy reached out, a desperate letter, not an invitation. She'd found their files. She was terrified, not for herself, but for her unborn son. She'd finally seen what they really were. She wanted out, but couldn't do it alone. She.

It was substandard work. I'm reading it now. It's exceptionally well researched. She held up a page. This methodology section alone is graduate level excellence. Doctor Marcus opened his mouth, closed it. Furthermore, I've reviewed Maya's entire academic record, 4.0 GPA published in three peer reviewed journals. She looked at him. So tell me what exactly about her work is garbage? Silence. Or perhaps this has nothing to do with the quality of her work. Doctor Marcus shifted. I was providing constructive feedback. Constructive? You publicly humiliated a student, destroyed her property, made sexist remarks. That's not what I heard every word. I've been sitting in the back for 40 minutes. The class was dead silent. Doctor Chen turned to me. Maya, how long has this been going on? All semester examples. He's called my work cute, that I probably had help from male colleagues, suggested I'm only here because of diversity quotas. Doctor Marcus's face went red. Those are lies, are they?

He picked up more pages. And destroying a student's work. Grounds for immediate disciplinary action. Doctor Chen, I can explain, explain to the dean tomorrow 9:00am. She looked at the class. You're all witnesses. Then she turned to me. Maya, you'll reprint your thesis on the department's budget and you'll be assigned a new advisor. A new advisor. Doctor Marcus will no longer be supervising any students. Marcus stood up. You can't do that. I absolutely can. You've violated university policy. She looked at him with pure contempt. Pack your office. You're on administrative leave. For what? Giving honest feedback. For harassment, for discrimination. She paused. The dean already knows. I called him before I came today. Doctor Chen smiled coldly. He's reviewing your tenure status as we speak. Doctor Marcus's face drained of all color. Tenure review. You think this goes unnoticed?

I want everyone to see this. 30 graduate students circled his desk. I stood frozen at the front. This is what happens when someone doesn't take their work seriously. My stomach dropped.

Or retail, someone in the back added. The class erupted. I stood there, pieces of my thesis scattered around my shoes. Fighting back tears, Doctor Marcus leaned against his desk, arms crossed, marking. You know what your problem is? You think because you got good grades as an undergrad you can handle graduate level work. You can't. My hands shook. Doctor Marcus If there were issues with my work, could have what? Held your hand.

That's the point of unannounced evaluations. The student stopped at the door, turned around. Doctor Chen, walked down the aisle.

My grandmother told me, stop renting apartments and buy the worst house in the best neighborhood you can afford. Fix it up yourself and you'll thank me in 20 years. When I was 24, I just got my first real job as a nurse and was looking at nice rental apartments. Everyone my age was living in trendy downtown lofts, showing off their granite countertops and gym amenities. But grandma pulled me aside at Sunday dinner and made me drive with her through this expensive neighborhood I'd never considered. She pointed at this tiny, rundown house with peeling paint and an overgrown yard that I saw has been on the market for eight months. She said nobody wants it because it looks terrible next to these million dollar homes. But the bones are good and you can't fake location. I looked at her like she was crazy. The house was hideous. Broken shutters, dead lawn. Probably needed everything redone. Grandma, I don't know how to fix houses. I barely know how to change a light bulb. She laughed. I didn't know how to raise four kids until I had them. You learn by doing. That conversation stuck with me for weeks. I toured shiny rental apartments with my friends. Finally, I called a realtor and looked at grandma's ugly house. It was worse inside. Carpet from the 1970s, pink bathroom tile, kitchen cabinets that looked like they belonged in a Trailer. But it was in the best school district in the city, walking distance to parks, and surrounded by houses worth 10 times more. I put in an offer $40,000 below asking price. Accepted immediately. My friends thought I'd lost my mind. Every time we hung out, they'd show off their modern amenities while roasting my dump. One friend said I could never live somewhere that embarrassing. What if I brought a date home to that disaster? Another kept joking that I was living in the neighborhood crack house. They brag about their rooftop pools and doorman, then ask if my house had running water yet. I'll admit, pulling up next to their luxury buildings in my beat up Honda, I wondered if grandma was wrong. But then, and I'd remember her saying, pretty apartments make you a renter forever, ugly houses make you wealthy. For three years, I spent every weekend at Home Depot learning to do everything myself. YouTube became my construction university. I love and drywall, plumbing, electrical work, landscaping, whatever needed fixing. My social life basically ended because everyone assumed I was too broke to go out. While my friends were posting Instagram stories from expensive restaurants, I was covered in paint trying to make my house livable. Slowly I started recognizing what good bones actually meant. The foundation was solid, the roof just needed new shingles. The plumbing was old, but function most importantly, three more houses on my street sold to young families willing to Renovate and property values started climbing fast. The neighborhood was gentrifying exactly like grandma predicted. Coffee shops opened, new restaurants moved in. The elementary school got renovated and started winning awards. Then the pandemic hit and everything changed suddenly.

A few weeks ago, my best friend, Courtney, called me sobbing. I lost my baby Kate exactly 10 weeks ago. My stomach dropped. Courtney had miscarried four times now, all at precisely 10 weeks. I'm a nurse practitioner. That timing pattern doesn't occur naturally. I drove straight to her house where her husband, Joe answered looking exhausted. She's resting. This one hit her hard. I need to see her maybe tomorrow. Joe, I'm her best friend and I'm a nurse. Let me help. He reluctantly let me in. Courtney was in bed, pale. And when I hugged her, I noticed bruising on her inner arm, fresh needle marks, multiple injection sites. Courtney, these marks. She looked confused. I don't remember getting any shots. I just, I woke up with them after I blacked out last night. You blacked out? Joe interrupted us from the doorway. She faints sometimes, stress from the pregnancy. Three days later, Courtney was feeling better and we met for coffee. I've been thinking, she said. I never actually saw my regular OBGYN during any of my pregnancies. Joe always said he found better specialists. That seemed wrong. Doctor Holly, you've seen her for years. Joe said she was too busy. He'd take me to appointments, but I'd always feel so drowsy in the waiting room. He'd go in to talk to the doctor. While I rested in the car, I called Doctor Holly's office. That afternoon, pretending to be Courtney, checking on my records. I need to verify my appointment history for insurance. It's Roberts. Our records show you called to transfer your care elsewhere last year and the year before, always after positive pregnancy tests. That evening, Courtney texted me again. Found something weird. Joe keeps the detailed calendar in his phone. It has all my periods marked and there are red X's. Exactly 14 days after each period starts. Going back three years, 14 days after period starts is ovulation peak fertility. Courtney, does anything happen on the red X days? She thought about it. Around then is when Joe makes me tea. I guess he says it's good for sleep and fertility. I always take it because I'm usually tired and we want to start a family. I was so suspicious that the next day I came over the next day while Joe was at work. That's when Courtney showed me something else. I found this tiny safe in his closet, like the kind doctors use for medications, but it's locked. We tried every code we could think of, but nothing worked. Courtney think those nights he gives you the tea. What happens after she went pale? I always wake up feeling sore down there, Joe says. We tried for a baby, but I never remember it. My stomach turned. He was drugging her and assaulting her on her fertile days to get her pregnant. Oh, my god. Could the miscarriages Be him, she shot out. I thought back to my medical training. Courtney, does anything weird happen before each miscarriage? Any sort of pattern? She thought about it for a while. Now that I think about it, I get really sick days before. For each one, way more sick than usual. Her eyes went wide. Joe makes me soup, some special recipe he says helps with morning sickness. Every single time. Every time she yelled. He's insistent I eat it all. We went back to the safe. Courtney remembered something. His ex girlfriend's name was Marie. Her birthday was October 15th. The safe clicked open. Inside were vials of medications, two types, one labeled with a fertility drug code, the other.

What thing? I asked, confused because everything seemed present and accounted for. Your thing isn't there. She was staring at my junk with this weird concerned look. I tap my stick on her cheek trying to be funny. I think you're staring right at it. No, not that thing. Hold on. She reached out and started examining me more closely through my boxers and she said the words that ruined my birthday. Holy shit. I think you should get to a hospital. She made me pull up my pants and grab my keys. No explanation, just pure panic on her face. We got in my car and she insisted on driving because I was already freaking out. The whole ride to the emergency room, she kept glancing at me with this worried expression. What's wrong? Just tell me. I was starting to imagine the worst. She grip the steering wheel tighter. There's no easy way to say this, but you only have one ball. What? I actually yelled it so loud. She swerved a little. There's only one ball, one nut, one marble, whatever you want to call it. There's supposed to be two and you've got one. She was talking fast like she needed to get it all out. My mind was racing. How would I never notice this? I've been living in this body for 21 years and somehow missed that I Was anatomically incomplete. My hands were shaking as I tried to process what she was saying. Did it fall out? Was I born this way? What happened to my jelly beans? At the hospital, they took me back pretty quickly. Once I explained the situation, the doctor examined me and confirmed what Sienna had discovered. I definitely only had one testicle. But what he said next made even less sense. According to your medical records, this makes perfect sense. It's all here from the operation. He was reading from his computer screen. What operation? I've never had an operation in my life. I was completely lost. Now, the doctor looked up, surprised. You should probably take this up with your parents, but according to this, you had surgery when you were 7 years old. I called my dad right there from the hospital bed. He answered on the second ring all cheerful because he knew it was my birthday. But when I explained where I was and what I just Learned, his voice changed completely. I heard him say to my mom in the background, honey, he knows I'm gonna have to come clean to him now. My stomach dropped. Come clean about what? What else had they been hiding from me? My dad got back on the phone and took a deep breath. When you were 7 years old, you had testicular cancer. We caught it early and it was completely operable, but they had to remove one of Your test.

They didn't realize they just declared war on 2,000 bored teenagers with nothing but time and spite. It's started when Principal Morrison announced a new policy. Students caught sharing the school Wi-Fi password will face immediate suspension. The password was 47 characters long, randomly generated every week and only given to teachers. My friend Marcus was the first to strike back. He brought a 30 foot Ethernet cable to school and plugged directly into the computer lab wall. When Mr Morrison walked by, Marcus was sitting in the hallway, laptop connected, cable snaking under the door. Marcus, what are you doing using wired internet? Sir? The policy only mentions Wi-Fi. That cable is a tripping hazard. I put up caution sign. Marcus had indeed placed tiny yellow wet floor signs every three feet along the cable. Mr Morrison updated the policy. No Ethernet cables over six feet. So Marcus brought six separate six foot cables and five friends. They formed a human chain, each person holding a laptop connected to each other, passing internet from the lab to the cafeteria like a digital bucket brigade. This is ridiculous, Mr Morrison said. This is compliance. Marcus replied, each cable is exactly six feet. New rule, no daisy chaining connection. That's when Jennifer got involved. She noticed the smart TV in the library was connected to Wi-Fi. She screen mirrored her phone to the TV. use The TV's browser to create a hotspot that broadcast to her laptop. Jennifer, you're using the school Wi-Fi? No, sir, I'm using the TV's connection. The TV isn't a student. The TV doesn't need suspension threats, she added sweetly. Mr Morrison banned using school devices as intermediaries. Alex took a different approach. He stood outside the teacher's lounge with a clipboard claiming he was conducting a password security audit for his computer science project. He'd ask teachers to write their password down to test memory pattern. 3 teachers actually did it before word spread. Alex, this is deception. This is social engineering research, sir. Very educational. Did you get the password? That would be unethical to reveal. Meanwhile, Sarah had noticed something beautiful. The attendant system auto connected to Wi-Fi when teachers logged in. She volunteered as an office aid and memorized the password as it briefly appeared on screen during setup. She didn't share it though. Instead, she sold the service. Bring her your device. She'd connect it for you, then change your Mac address so it looked like a printer. By week 3, half the school was showing up as HP Laserjet on the network. Why do we have 400 printer? Mr Morrison asked AIT. Those aren't printers, I t. Replied. Then what are they? Creative student. The arms race escalated. Ryan figured out the password was always posted in the teacher's bathroom. Thinking students wouldn't see it there, he used a drone with a camera during lunch. When the bathroom was empty, the footage was shaky but readable. Ryan, you flew a drone into school property, into the courtyard. Sir, the bathroom window was open. I was investigating ventilation efficiency for my environmental science project. Mr Morrison put curtain.

We had a rule in our house. If dad was wearing his red baseball cap indoors, nobody was allowed to talk to him. Not a word. Not even pass the salt at dinner. It wasn't every day. Maybe once or twice a week, he'd come home from work, red cap on, and we'd all just navigate around him. Mom would put his dinner plate down silently. My sister and I would do homework in our rooms. If we needed something from the living room and he was there, we'd wait. I thought this was totally normal. Like how some dads have a don't bother me during the game rule. Ours was just the red cap thing. If friends were over and saw the cap, I'd whisper, Red Cap Day! And they just shrug and we play outside. The rule was so ingrained that I once got in trouble at school for ignoring a substitute teacher. She was wearing a red hat, and my brain just went, don't talk. Couldn't even explain it properly to the principal. Mom enforced it hard, too. my little sister asked dad for help with homework on a red cap day. Mom grabbed her arm so tight it left marks and dragged her to her room. Later, she apologized, but said we had to respect Dad's needs. In high school, I finally asked mom why dad needed red cap days. She got this tired look and Said your father works very hard, and sometimes he needs quiet to decompress. The cap helps us know when to give him space. Made sense to me. Dad's work hard. Whatever. I moved out for college, and roommates thought it was hilarious when I'd warn them about my dad's red cap rule for visits, just don't talk to him. If he's wearing it, he's cool otherwise. Last year, I'm home for Thanksgiving. I'm 26 now. Dad's wearing the red cap at dinner. We're all eating silently when my boyfriend, who I'd warned repeatedly, accidentally says, sir, could you pass the. The entire table freezes. Dad's hand stops halfway to his fork, his jaw clenches, then he just gets up and leaves. Doesn't say a word, just walks out to the garage. Mom starts crying, actually crying at Thanksgiving dinner. My boyfriend is mortified, apologizing profusely. I'm pissed at him, but also confused by Mom's reaction. It's just the stupid cap rule. Why is she sobbing? My sister pulls me aside later. You really don't get it, do you? Turns out dad wasn't decompressing. The red cap days were when he was actively fighting the urge to hit us. Yeah, the fucking red cap was his. I want to beat my family warning system. He'd started wearing it after he gave my mom a black eye when I was three. Went to anger management, and the therapist suggested a visual cue to let the

My twin brother Jake and I were inseparable until we turned 16. That's when our grandfather died and left us his vintage motorcycle collection. 12 bikes worth about $80,000 total. The will said we had to split everything equally. When we turned 18, Jake got obsessed with this one bike. A 1969 Harley that grandpa called his baby. Jake would sit in the garage just staring at it, planning how he'd fix it up. Two weeks before our 18th birthday, came home from work and found Jake in our shared bedroom, crying. He handed me a crumpled paper. Our parents divorce documents. Dad was moving to Florida. Mom was keeping the house, but she'd have to sell grandpa's bikes to pay for it. Jake grabbed my shoulders. Listen, if you sign over your half to me, I'll buy the Harley from mom, and we can keep at least one bike in the family. I could see he'd been planning this speech. His hands were shaking. I trusted him completely. We were twins. We shared everything. So I signed. The day we turned 18, Jake went to the lawyer's office alone. He came back that evening with keys to the Harley and a huge grin. Got it for $3,000, he said. Mom, so happy. Something felt wrong. I called mom. Her voice got weird when I asked about the bike sale. After 20 minutes of me pushing, she finally admitted the Truth. It hadn't just bought the Harley. He bought all 12 bikes for $40,000. Exactly half their value. My signature had given him legal ownership of my entire inheritance. My own mother had helped him do it. Because Jake convinced her I didn't really care about motorcycles. He said you told him you just wanted the money for college. Anyway, she whispered. I confronted Jake that night. He didn't even look guilty. You were never into bikes like me, he said, polishing the Harley's chrome. This way, they stay in the family where they belong. I moved out the next week. We didn't speak for three years. Then last month, I got a call from mom. Jake was getting married.

When my brother got engaged, they asked for a favor. The firefighters who found me wrapped in a target blanket outside their station 9 were told by my biological parents that I had the devil's hair. And honestly, I still don't know if that was some religious thing or just some lame excuse. Either way, I got stuck with this copper situation on my head that apparently warranted a one way ticket to the adoption system when I was 3 months old, which, you know, totally normal parenting decision. Nothing traumatic there at all. The universe must have felt bad, though, because I got adopted by an amazing couple that I call mom and dad proudly. Growing up with my adoptive parents was like living in one of those hallmark movies. My mom taught me to arrange flowers while telling me I was absolutely luminous. And my dad coached my soccer team. Even though I once accidentally scored on our own goal, he still high fived me after the game. I'm 28 now and got married last year in a heart stopping wedding my mom planned herself. I have an anxious rescue dog who's afraid of butterflies and life is genuinely good, like suspiciously good, like waiting for the other shoe to drop good, which is when I get this text from an unknown number. Hi, sweetie, this is your birth mother. I know it's been a while. But we'd love to stop by and reconnect. Are you free Saturday? I'm staring at my phone like it just grew teeth. But of course, I text back. Sure, because I'm physically incapable of saying no to anyone, even people who literally abandoned me. When I hear them arrive, my first thought is, oh, god, here's the shoe. And my hands are shaking so violently I can barely open the door. They waltz in like we're having a common reunion, not like they literally abandoned me for having the wrong hair color. And suddenly I'm learning I have three siblings. My entire family is either blonde or brunette. Not a single redhead in sight. They're hugging me and crying while I'm standing there like a mannequin having an out of body experience. My heart pounding so hard, I think they must hear it. Then my brother drops the bomb. My fiance would love to me you, especially since mom mentioned your adoptive mother is that famous wedding planner. And we were hoping, well, family helps family, right? And I find myself nodding. Why am I nodding? All while they explain they need financial help and could my adoptive mom maybe plan the wedding for free as a family favor? And I hear myself saying, I'll think about it. When my brain is screaming, are you kidding me right now? I take a deep breath and say with my voice cracking, I'll pay for the wedding. I'll ask my mom about Planning it. But first, I need to answer one question. Why did you give me up? The room goes quiet and my biological mother starts crying while my father clears his throat. And I'm gripping my mug so hard I think it might shatter. It was the hair, he finally admits, not even looking ashamed, just a matter of fact, like he's explaining why he returned a sweater. Not many people in our family have red hair, so I had a DNA test done right after you were born. You're 100.

My real name wasn't Brandon. It was Dolores. Yeah, you heard that right. My parents named me after my great grandma because her will said any first born kid named after her would get half her money when they turned 18. My parents really wanted that cash, so they figured they'd just stick me with it and I deal with it later. When I was little, I didn't get why it was so bad. I mean, I knew it was weird, but mom kept saying it was special. He'd tell everyone at the grocery store or the dentist office about how I was named after great Grandma Dolores and how it meant I'd be rich someday. People would smile, but their eyes looked confused when they saw me standing there in my Dinosaur shirt and Batman sneakers. Kindergarten was when it started getting really bad. Teacher called roll on the first day and said, Dolores Martinez. And everyone turned to look at me. This kid named Tyler laughed so hard he fell out of his chair. From that day on, kids called me Dolores the Explorer or Dolores the doofus. Tried to ignore it, but it was. Every single day I begged my parents to let me use my middle name. Kyle. It was right there, normal, easy. But mom would get this angry look and say, don't be ungrateful. That name is your future. That name Is putting you through college. Dad would just shrug and change the subject. By third grade, I stopped raising my hand in class. The teacher called on me. Everyone would snicker when she said my name. I started eating lunch in the bathroom just to avoid the cafeteria, where kids would yell, hey, Dolores, where's your purse? Or, Dolores, did you do your nails today? Middle school was somehow worse. School database had my legal name in it. So every substitute teacher, every school assembly, every time they announced on a roll over the intercom, there it was. Dolores Martinez. Kids would howl with laughter. I got shoved into lockers. Someone wrote Dolores is a girl on my gym locker in permanent marker. I tried going by just D in 8th grade for, like, two months. It worked. My friends called me D. I felt almost normal. Then this substitute in English class looked at the roster and said, Dolores, that's adorable. Is there a Dolores here? With this stupid grin, I walked out. Just left. Got three days suspension for that. My parents were furious, but not because I was hurting. Mom screamed about how I was being dramatic, and dad said, two more years, and you'll thank us when that check comes. I locked myself in my room for the rest of the night. High school broke me. I barely showed up. When I did, I kept my head down and didn't talk to anyone. I wore the Same black hoodie every day and sat in the back corner of every class. I started scratching lines into my arm with a paperclip during lunch, just to feel.

Once she started my drink with a spoon that had been sitting in the peanut butter. I was done playing games, but I needed to be absolutely sure this was intentional before calling my police dad. So I decided on one final test, something she couldn't possibly mess up by accident. There was a chocolate cake in the display case with a little label that clearly said contains tree nuts. Does this cake have nuts? I asked, pointing to it. No, completely not. Three she and quickly already boxing it up. Are you sure? Because I'm extremely allergic, remember? She nodded eagerly, and right before I took a bite, I picked up the box and showed her the label. Wait a second. It says right here there's nuts! Her face went red. There aren't nuts in that cake! She actually raised her voice. Other customers turned to look, but the label! I said, there's no nuts! She tried to cover up her burst of anger with a smile, but it was too late. I knew this wasn't some mistake. After she stormed into the bathroom, I stood in the hallway and heard her voice, urgent and frustrated. I need her to lose Hugo's baby. It's not fair that she still has to be in his life. My heart dropped. My ex boyfriend's name was Hugo. I quickly unblocked him on Instagram and did a quick search of his V S C O. That was LinkedIn. His bio? Sure Enough! There she was, a photo of them together, kissing by the Eiffel Tower. I pushed open the door. She spun around, phone still pressed to her ear. I'm not pregnant, I said. She froze, then slowly lowered the phone. Um. Hello? What the hell are you doing in here? I'm not pregnant. Don't play dumb with me. Hugo showed me the ultrasound, the texts about you keeping the baby. But doubt was creeping into her voice. What ultrasound? We broke up six months ago. I haven't talked to him since. With shaking hands, she pulled up the ultrasound images. These are from Google, I said, laughing. You can literally see the watermark on the medical website. But he said you've been stalking him, showing up at his apartment. I blocked him everywhere. The truth was hitting her all at once. I've been poisoning you for two weeks, she whispered, with tears streaming down her face. I could have killed you. Yeah, I said. You could have. I actually laughed. You two deserve each other. I then took her phone from her trembling hands and sent Hugo a text. Come to the cafe now. Emergency. His response was immediate. On my way. I ordered an oat milk latte while we waited for him to arrive. She made it correctly this time.

My daughter Ella is 8 months old and I was changing her diaper in the nursery when my sister Molly showed up. I just gotten Ella on the changing table when my phone started buzzing in my back pocket. I turned my head for literally two seconds to silence it and I heard this sick thud. Ella had rolled right off the table onto the hardwood floor. She started screaming immediately. I dropped to my knees next to her and her little arms were reaching up for me, but I kept my hands hovering near her head without touching her. Molly's footsteps pounded down the hallway. What happened? She. I ran into the room and when she saw Ella on the floor, she lunged forward. I threw my arm out and blocked her. Don't touch her. Molly stared at me. What are you talking about? She's crying. She fell on her head. We can't move her. I already had my phone out and was dialing 9, 1, 1. Are you insane? Pick your baby up. No. Molly reached around me and I had to shift my whole body to block her. Move out of my way. Right now. Her hands were on my shoulders trying to push me aside, but I didn't budge. The 9, 1 1 operator answered and I started explaining what happened while Molly kept trying to get past me. This Is insane. Just pick her up. I can't. It could make it worse. Ella's face was bright red and both her arms were stretched up toward me. Your daughter is screaming in pain and you're just kneeling there doing nothing. I'm doing exactly what I'm supposed to do. This is so cruel. Molly's voice cracked. You're torturing her. She needs her mother. She needs her mother to protect her spine. The operator told me to keep Ella still and watch for any changes. Molly started pacing behind me. I can't watch you do this to her. This is sick. I kept crying and reaching and I kept my hands near her without moving her. The paramedics finally showed up and came into the nursery. One of them knelt down next to me. Molly moved forward and the other paramedic held up his hand. Ma'am, step back, please. I'm her aunt and I think you need to know she left this baby on the floor for 15 minutes. Step back. He turned to me.

I'll make your weekend project last for weeks. So I worked at this big hardware store for six years. You know, the one where you supposedly save big money? I was in flooring, which meant I spent most days cutting carpet for people who had no idea what they actually needed. The job wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great, either. I watched managers rotate through like we were some kind of training ground for people who didn't want to be there. Part timers came and went. I stayed because it paid bills while I figured out what to do with my graphic design degree that was collecting dust. Then in April, I finally got a real job. Actual design work. I put in my two weeks and counted down every single shift. Last day finally came. I had four hours left. I was cleaning up the carpet area when I heard fingers snap behind me. Carpet now. I turned around, and there was Jared. Of course it was Jared. Jared owned half the apartment buildings in town, and everyone knew he was garbage. He'd come in every few months, talk down to whoever helped him buy the absolute cheapest carpet we had, and never tip. I'd heard him brag about evicting families because their kids were too loud. Real piece of work. But today, I didn't care, because I was about to be done forever. What do you need? I asked. Redoing units. Need a bunch of cuts. Hurry up. He walked toward the carpet machine without waiting for me to respond. I followed him and grabbed my cutting tools. Jared found the cheapest roll we had. Brown carpet that looked like it belonged in a dentist office from 1987. He wanted third teen cuts total. Different sizes. 12 feet by 9 feet, 12 by 11, 12 by 13. All over the place. Got buddies coming this weekend to help install, he said. Need this done fast. While I measured and marked the first cut, he kept talking. Just bought another building on Fifth Street. Gonna flip those units, too. Easy money when you know what you're doing. I nodded and started cutting. Evicted this family last month because their kids kept leaving bikes in the hallway. Told them three times. Some people just don't listen. I cut the second piece. You still in school or you done wasting time? Got a new job. Actually, this is my last day. Good for you. Flooring is a dead end anyway. I finished the third cut and started on the fourth. He kept going on about his properties and how much rent he charged and which tenants he was planning to get rid of next. Every word made me want to help him less. But I kept my face neutral and kept cutting. Finally, I finished all 13 pieces. Normally, I'd roll them tight, write the measurements on each one with a marker, and stack them. Neatly, that's what you're supposed to do. That's what makes it easy for the customer to know which piece goes where. But I didn't do that. I rolled every single piece loose, real loose. So they all ended up basically the same size, even though they were different lengths. Then I loaded them onto the cart without writing anything on them. These are ready, I said. I'll bring them up front. Jared was already walking toward the registers. I pushed the cart up, and he paid without looking at me. Then I helped him load everything into his trailer. 13 big rolls of brown carpet all sitting there looking identical. Thanks, he said. Didn't tip.

I'm allergic to gluten, dairy and shellfish. My boyfriend Austin knows this. His mom knows this. His sister knows this. I've been dating him for about a year now and we had two separate incidents where his family served me stuff I couldn't eat and I ended up sick. First time was at a barbecue where his mom said everything was safe but she used butter on the corn. Second time was at Thanksgiving where his sister made this fancy pasta and swore it was gluten free. But it definitely wasn't because I spent the next eight hours throwing up in Austin's bathroom. So when his mom invited me to their big family dinner last month, I made sure to call her ahead of time. I said, hey, just a reminder, I have those allergies, gluten, dairy and shellfish. She laughed and said, don't worry, honey, we'll have plenty for you to eat. I should have known better. I got to their house at 6 and the dining room table was loaded with food. There was lasagna with cheese and regular noodles. There were shrimp scampi sitting right there in a fancy bowl. There was garlic bread that was definitely not gluten free. There was a salad, but it had croutons and some kind of creamy dressing all over it. His mom had made literally nothing I could eat. I stood there staring at the table while everyone started. Sitting down, Austin's dad was already piling lasagna on his plate. His sister was grabbing shrimp. His mom looked at me and said, well, go ahead, make yourself a plate. I looked at Austin and he shrugged like he didn't know what to say. I pulled him aside to the kitchen and asked if his mom forgot about my allergies. He said she probably just got busy cooking and didn't think about it. I had packed a Tupperware container in my bag just in case. I'd made myself chicken and rice with vegetables, nothing fancy, but at least I could eat it. I pulled it out of my bag and sat down at the table with everyone else. Austin's mom noticed immediately. She stopped mid sentence and stared at my container. Her face went red. She asked what that was. I said, oh, I brought my own food since everything here has stuff I'm allergic to. The whole table went quiet. Austin's dad put his fork down. His sister stopped chewing. His mom's voice got really tight and she said, I spent all day cooking this meal and you bring your own food? Like my cooking isn't good enough. I tried to explain that I literally couldn't eat anything she made because of my allergies. She said I was being dramatic and that allergies weren't that serious. Austin just sat there saying nothing. Sister jumped in and said it was pretty rude to bring outside food to someone's dinner party. I said, I told your mom about my allergies ahead of time and she said she'd have food for me. His mom snapped that she did have food for me and pointed at the salad. I said, the salad has croutons and creamy dressing, which I can't eat. She rolled her eyes and said, just pick them out. I started eating my chicken.

We had a rule in our house. If dad was wearing his red baseball cap indoors, nobody was allowed to talk to him, not a word, not even pass the salt at dinner. It wasn't every day. Maybe once or twice a week he'd come home from work red cap on and we'd all just navigate around him. Mom would put his dinner plate down silently. My sister and I would do homework in our rooms. If we needed something from the living room and he was there, we'd wait. I thought this was totally normal, like how some dads have a don't bother me during the game rule. Ours was just the red cap thing. If friends were over and saw the cap, I'd whisper Red Cap Day and they just shrug and we'd play outside. The rule was so ingrained that I once got in trouble at school for ignoring a substitute teacher. She was wearing a red hat and my brain just went, don't talk. I couldn't even explain it properly to the principal. Mom enforced it hard, too. my little sister asked dad for help with homework on a Red Cap day. Mom grabbed her arm so tight it left marks and dragged her to a room. Later, she apologized but said we had to respect Dad's needs. In high school, I finally asked mom why dad needed Red Cap days. She got this tired look. And I said, your father works very hard, and sometimes he needs quiet to decompress. The cap helps us know when to give him space. Made sense to me. Dads work hard, whatever. I moved out for college and roommates thought it was hilarious when I'd warned them about my dad's red cap rule before visits. Just don't talk to him if he's wearing it. He's cool otherwise. Last year, I'm home for Thanksgiving. I'm 26 now. Dad's wearing the red cap at dinner. We're all eating silently when my boyfriend, who I'd warned repeatedly, accidentally says, sir, could you pass the.

If they caught you with anything that wasn't purchased from their overpriced kitchen, it got confiscated immediately. My friend Enzo had severe food allergies, peanuts, dairy, shellfish, the list went on. His mom spent hours every Sunday meal prepping safe lunches for him because the school food was basically a minefield. But every single day, security would stop him at the entrance and take his lunch away. School policy, they'd say, tossing his carefully prepared meals into the crash. Buy lunch here or don't eat. Enzo would sit at our table every day with just an apple juice he could afford, watching us eat while his stomach growled. We started sharing our food with him, but even that wasn't enough. He was losing weight, falling asleep in class, and his grades were dropping. That's when his little sister, Amara got involved. She was only a sophomore, but she had this fire in her eyes that made you nervous. This is ridiculous, she said. They can't force someone to starve. We thought she was just venting. But Amara had a plan. The next Monday, she walked into the cafeteria carrying a massive poster board covered in medical documents, allergy test results and photos of Enzo looking exact Austin and thin. She didn't say a word to anyone. She just sat down at The center table where everyone could see her and started eating the lunch their mom had packed. Within minutes, a lunch lady marched over. You know the rules. Hand over that food. Amara looked up calmly and said, I'm documenting a human rights violation. Please state your name for the record. She had her phone recording everything. The lunch lady froze. You're forcing my brother to choose between following school rules and not dying from an allergic reaction. That's what we call discrimination.

My mom didn't just check my homework. She rewrote it. Every single night. I'd show her my math notes, my reading journal, even my stupid doodles. Because she thought idle hands LED to ruined futures. Phones were banned. Friends were handpicked by her. And dating. Yeah, right. Not until marriage, apparently. So when I hit 10th grade and got paired with Nathan for our biology project, I knew just saying his name at home would start World War 3. But Nathan wasn't like other guys. He actually listened when I talked about feeling like some programmed robot. He shared his secrets too soon. I was sneaking calls on my school laptop using discord, pretending I was doing virtual tutoring sessions. The lie started small. I'd tell mom I had to debate club meetings so I could hang out at the library with Nathan. I'd hide selfies we took together under folders labeled Algebra Flashcards on my computer. But then mom started her snooping routine again. One night, she found my real science notebook. The one with tiny hearts drawn around Nathan's name. She absolutely lost it. Dream that I was throwing my entire future away for some worthless boy. Said she'd pull me out of school if I ever disobeyed her again. I cried for hours. But then something inside me just clicked. I started keeping two notebooks. One was clean, perfect. Sterilized for her daily inspections. The other held my actual Life. Real notes, poems, even love letters Nathan would slip into my locker. By senior year, I'd become a master deceiver. I had this whole routine down. Wipe the laptop history every time, swap SIM cards in my phone, log out of anything remotely personal. Mom still believed I was single, friendless, and focused only on college prep. Like some study machine. I got so good at it that I even applied to school she didn't know about. Nathan and I both got into the same university 800 miles away. I pretended I didn't even apply there. When the acceptance letter came, I intercepted the mail and hid it in my secret notebook. The funny thing is, all her rules just made me better at breaking them. Every restriction became a puzzle to solve. When she installed tracking apps on my phone, I Learned to use Nathan's. When she banned social media, I created accounts she'd never find. When she said no dating, I dated anyway. Just underground. Graduation day finally came. When I walked across that stage, I didn't wave to mom sitting in the audience. I waved at Nathan, who was cheering from the student section. We've been together for two whole years, and she had absolutely no clue. After the ceremony, mom was going on about my bright future and how proud she was that I'd stayed focused. That's when I dropped the bomb. I told

I knocked on the bathroom door, hey, babe, I really need to use the bathroom. I just drained it and refilled with fresh hot water. Give me like another hour, Robbie. I've been holding it since 6. I'm dying here. The keys are on the counter. I looked at our apartment door. Then I looked at the balcony. We're on the second floor. There's this massive planter box out there with dead herbs that his mom gave us as a housewarming gift. I've been meaning to throw them out for weeks. Something in me just snapped. I went outside, yanked out the dead basil and Rosemary and peed right into that planter box. The relief was incredible. I didn't even care. I came back inside, threw the dead plants in the trash, washed my hands and got into bed. Robbie finally emerged at midnight looking like a raisin. He came into the bedroom. You didn't grab me a Gatorade? I always bought him blue Gatorade from the gas station because he likes it ice cold. I didn't go to the gas station. He pulled out his phone and opened the app that tracks our shared credit card. There's no charge. Where did you go? I didn't go anywhere. His face scrunched up, confused. Then where did you. I pointed at the balcony. He walked over to the sliding door, turned on the porch light and looked at the empty planter. You peed in My mom's herb garden, they were already dead, Robbie. That's disgusting, sting. That's our outdoor space. I sat up, you know what's disgusting? Driving to a gas station at eleven PM after a 12 hour shift because my grown fiance won't let me use my own bathroom. It's our bathroom. And I was using it for five hours, Robbie. Five hours. Your fingers are literally wrinkled. You look like you've been underwater for days. I had a hard day at work. I had a hard day too. I had a patient coat on me during our 9, I still managed to not commandeer the only bathroom in our apartment for the entire evening. He called me selfish and immature, said I violated our shared space. I told him he could take his 4 hour spa sessions back to his childhood bathroom at his mom's house. He packed a bag and left. That was 3 days ago. He's been texting me from his mom's place I owe him an apology for defiling our home and being disrespectful. His mom even called me yesterday asking what I did to upset her son so badly. I sanitized that planter twice with bleach. I even bought new soil and new herbs. He's still not speaking to me.

He'd whisper cruel things like, you're so ugly and worthless and you can't even tell anyone I said it. While mom praised him for being patient with his disabled siblings. Watching my dad suffer under the silence rule became excruciating now that I knew that was what my future would be, too. One evening during dinner, I watched him try to gesture something important to mom, only for her to wave him away dismissively while my brother laughed at him. Something inside me snapped and I. I stood up from the table and said the first words I'd spoken in 11 years. Listen to him. The effect was immediate and terrifying. Ian started screaming, I'm getting stupid, I'm getting stupid, while clutching his head dramatically. Mom's careful mask slipped completely as she turned on me with pure rage and yelled, you're killing him. She locked me in what they called the silence room, a soundproof basement chamber where I was supposed to reflect on what I've done. I'd seen my sister sent there once because she screamed when she broke her arm. My brother faked a seizure the next day, claiming that my voice had poisoned his brain. And the whole extended family mobilized to restore order. They produced fake medical records, forced my older siblings to sign statements against me, and threatened to have me declared legally incompetent. I actually started doubting my own sanity when my oldest brother, who'd Been silent for 23 years, whispered, just be quiet and it all goes away. But then someone ended it all, my father. He came down to the basement one night when my mother was beating the sound out of me while I bit my lips shut to keep from crying out. And he shouted enough. His voice was rusty and cracked, but it shattered Mom's control completely. He revealed that he been secretly recording everything for years as insurance, documenting our family's ritual abuse in case he ever found the courage to act. Mom had a complete breakdown and she and Ian sobbed, clutching each other. Dad's evidence was overwhelming enough for authorities to intervene and two of my siblings and I escaped together. But the damage was deep. One of sisters chose to stay silent because she was too psychologically broken to handle the idea of speaking again. She still never said a word and lives in a nursing home now. At 22 years old, I'm not in contact with my parents. Last I heard, my dad has gone back to silence too and retreated under my mother's rule. I'm now 21 and living independently, but my voice still cracks and fails me during important conversations because 11 years of forced silence left permanent damage to my vocal cords and confidence. Sometimes I wake up convinced that I've lost my voice again and I have to whisper my name in the darkness to prove to myself that I'm still Here and I can still speak.

When I was 7 and my little brother was born, I said, is it a boy or a girl? And my mother pressed her hand over my mouth and told me I would never speak again. Those were the last words I spoke for 11 years. The silence thing wasn't new in our family. It came from the religious community where both my parents were raised. The rule was that only the youngest child in the family was allowed to speak so the older siblings couldn't corrupt them. I had three older siblings, none of whom I'd ever heard speak. My sister was only two years older than me, so she'd been silent almost her whole life. Mom still had her voice because she was the youngest in her own family, but dad had been silenced when he was 5 and his little sister was born. Mom absolutely loved this rule and would mock dad constantly for his silence, saying things like, it's so peaceful without your stupid opinions. While he could only communicate through gestures that she usually ignored. Her house was eerily quiet, just Mom's voice. And for the first seven years of my life, mine. But then my baby brother, Ian was born. Mom said, you've had seven years to say everything you needed to say, and now it's his turn to be the special one. Big girls don't need voices when they have a baby brother. To protect, she told me that if I ever made any sound again, including crying or laughing, she would send me away to live with strangers who didn't love me like she did. She put tape over my mouth for the first week to help me remember my new role in the family while my older siblings looked at me with haunted sympathy. Overnight, I became invisible while my new brother was treated like a precious prince. I realized this was how my older siblings had felt this whole time, and now I was in hell with them. Mom homeschooled all of us to keep our family's tradition secret, but Ian got real lessons where he could raise his hands to ask questions just like I used to. Now I just read silently with my older siblings. Mom would terrify me by showing me charts proving that Ian got stupider whenever I made any sound. And I genuinely believed I was stealing his intelligence. Look how much damage you did with that cough, she'd say, showing me fake declining numbers. Do you wanna ruin his future? I became obsessed with perfect silence, afraid that even breathing too loudly would hurt him. Ian never appreciated our silence. He deliberately break things in the house and.

I asked if anyone else showed up. She shook her head. That evening, Savannah posted from Scottsdale, matching pink outfits, pool cocktails, best weekend ever with these Queens. Dad texted three days later, glad you're okay. Just one sentence. After my six hour spinal fusion, mom called day 5, no apology. Savannah needed our support. She said. She needed support drinking by a pool. I replied, here's what's happening. I said, you owe me $22,000. You will pay $500 a month and don't expect to hear from me. Drew, Haley's lawyer brother, drafted the demand letter. Mom called it blackmail. Dad called it unnecessary. They sent $200 one month, skipped the next, then $150. I documented everything. Four months later, Haley and I got engaged. Her family and Aunt  Colleen  invited. My parents weren't. Mom called Haley. Maybe you could talk to him about being flexible. Flexible about spinal surgery. Your son might have permanent nerve damage. And you chose a party. Don't expect to be part of our lives. Six months in, they'd sent $2,800 total. I took them to court. Judge, do you dispute receiving $22,000? Dad, no. But have you paid it back? Mom, we've made some payments. How much exactly? $2,800 over three years. Judge looked over her glasses. Is there a reason you can't manage $500 a month? Dad explained Savannah's wedding expenses. Judgment in my favor, 650 monthly for three years or wage garnishment. Haley got pregnant four months later. We Didn't tell my family. They found out when she posted an ultrasound. Mom left a voicemail wanting to be part of her grandchild's life. Drew said document, don't respond. Harper came in September. Mom commented on the announcement. Can't wait to meet her. Haley blocked her. Three months later, Savannah showed up at Haley's hospital demanding to see her niece. Security called police. She he spent the night in jail. Judge extended the restraining order to five years with criminal charges for future violations. Harper just turned 3. Her party had everyone who mattered. They paid off the debt six months ago. Mom had surgery last week. Aunt  Colleen  said she's convinced. I'll reach out. I won't. I chose to stop showing up where I wasn't valued.

Mom called with a compromise. Different surgeon, August slot. Fresh out of residency, no specialization, terrible reviews. I said no. Savannah texted daily, devastated. Non refundable Airbnb. Her dream party. Two weeks before surgery, mom showed up with a grocery store. Sorry cake. Showed me Savannah's Pinterest board, custom shirts, desert photo Shoot. Three years ago, my parents were drowning. Dad laid off mom's boutique. Bleeding more. It's two months behind. I gave them $22,000. Will pay you back when things stabilize. They stabilized. New car.

June 14th, Haley's family brought breakfast. My aunt drove five hours from Portland. 7:00am. Nurse called my name. My parents weren't there. Savannah wasn't there. Six hour surgery.

She destroyed it with a hammer in front of him, and now she'll never see him again. I had been dating Trish for eight months when her nine year old son Jude's birthday came around. The kid had been watching gaming videos for months because all his friends played together online without him. At his birthday breakfast, his mom tossed an empty card at him while she shopped for designer handbags on her phone. I saw his face. I decided I had to do something to make it up to him. So the second Trish left to get her nails done, I took Jude to get the switch, too. He had been dreaming about. Are you serious right now? Jude kept asking as we loaded the cart with games and extra controllers. Mom's gonna crash out when she finds out you spent this much money on me. His hands were shaking with excitement as he picked out Pokemon and grabbed a case in his favorite color. Nine hundred dollars later, we were back home setting it up in his room when I heard Trisha's car screech into the driveway. Quick, put it away! Jude whispered, but it was too late. She walked into his room and saw him holding the controller, and her face went from confused to volcanic in less than two seconds. What the hell is this? She demanded. It's for my birthday, Jude said quietly. He Surprised me. Trish laughed. Oh, he surprised you? How nice. You know what would have been a better surprise? If he giving me that money for groceries instead of wasting it on this crap. Jude's voice cracked as he said, but, mom, all my friends have one. I just want to play with them.

She kicked the destroyed console pieces toward him. Everything in this house belongs to me, so I can do what I want with it. You're lucky I even feed you.

Trish rolled her eyes. So dramatic. Just like your father. Twenty minutes later, there was a knock on the door. Jude's dad, Keith, walked in and saw Jude's swollen face and the destroyed switch scattered across the bedroom. Trish was standing there with her fresh manicure and designer jeans. Get your stuff, buddy, Keith said quietly. Jude grabbed his backpack and some clothes. Stepping over the broken pieces of his birthday gift at the door, he turned to his mother. I'm never coming back here, ever. I hate you, Trish laughed. You be back tomorrow? Keith put his hand on Jude's shoulder and look Trish dead in the eyes. No, he won't. Keith filed for emergency custody the next morning with photos of the destroyed switch and my sworn statement about what I witnessed. Trish lost her son and the 800 a month in child support she had been using for her shopping sprees.

What shocking thing did you witness in the execution room? I was arriving at the prison for my brother's execution, scheduled for seven that evening. I was the only family member coming. The rest believed he was guilty. My brother was convicted of murdering his girlfriend 15 years ago and spent the last three in solitary confinement. He maintained his innocence every day, but that didn't matter anymore. When I got inside the prison, a guard escorted me through the cold hallways to the witness room. My hands were shaking. My brother was there somewhere, waiting to die for something I was sure he didn't do. My brother and the girlfriend he killed had been together since middle school. They loved each other with this anime level intensity. Even had an inside joke where he'd say, I'd kill to keep you, and she'd say I'd die to stay. Then she actually died. Found in their shared apartment, stabbed 53 times. The evidence showed my brother's fingerprints on the murder weapon. Knife from their apartment. My brother's DNA was also found under her fingernails. It seemed obvious, but there were problems. The evidence showed the girlfriend scratched and clawed at her attacker, but my brother had no scratches on him. The police arrested him, dragging him away while he was holding on to her limp body, still in denial about the fact she was gone. He even had an alibi at work when she Died. Three co workers confirmed it. But in the end, it didn't matter. The jury convicted him and he was sentenced to death. I always believed he was innocent. Seeing how he was more broken by the fact he'd never see her again than the fact he was literally sentenced to death confirmed it for me. So over the years, I spent thousands trying to prove it. I drained my savings hiring lawyers, private investigators. Nothing worked. Every appeal got denied. To make it worse, everyone in my family thought he was guilty. My parents stopped visiting after the first year. Told me I was embarrassing the family. My other siblings cut me off completely. My. My own mother said, stop defending a murderer. My brother's final appeal was denied last week. This was it. No more options, no more time. He was going to die. At the prison, I felt more hollow and empty than anything. The witness room was small, suffocatingly dark, and dimly lit. Almost like they wanted you to feel death inside it. It had a small window looking into the execution chamber with a gurney and lethal injections. That room was white. I looked over to the opposite side of the execution room and noticed the victim's mother sitting there. But what took me by surprise was my own mother was here, too. With my father and my two siblings all sitting away from me.

We made eye contact through the glass. He mouth, I love you, dude. No homo. I tried my best not to cry. I was his older brother, his role model. I couldn't let him see me break. So I cracked a smile and mouth, I love you, too. No homo. Back inside, my heart was tearing. At 6:35, the warden read the final statement. Brother's body tensed. This was really happening. This was the first moment I fully came face to face with the fact he was going to die. My brother would die. I felt a tear roll down my cheek. At 6:45, the warden asked him for his last words. His voice came through the speakers. I didn't do this. I loved her. He then looked at me. I love you, man. Thank you for never giving up on me. My heart was breaking. My mother looked right at him. No sadness in her eyes. The warden nodded to the executioner. I watched the executioner's hand move toward the injection button. This was it. 15 years of fighting, and I'd lost. My brother closed his eyes, getting ready for death. Then at 6:48, the phone in the execution room rang. The warden answered. His face went white immediately. Stop! Stop everything! The guards froze. The warden spoke into the phone. Are you certain? Yes, I understand. He hung up and turned to face the room. There's been a confession. The real killer just walked into the police station. I couldn't breathe. My brother's eyes flew open. What? The victim's mother screamed. No, that's not possible. The warden's voice was shaking. The victim's stepfather just confessed to the murder. He's at the station now. My mouth hung open. The stepfather, the one who wasn't here. Turns out he had terminal cancer. He couldn't die carrying the guilt. His confession detailed everything. He'd been sexually assaulting the victim's younger sister for years. The victim discovered it, fronted him, threatened to go to the police. He panicked and killed her. Stabbed her in my brother's apartment. Planted the knife. Scratched at my brother's clothes with her hand post mortem to plant the DNA under her nails. He framed the boyfriend because everyone would believe the explosive, passionate boyfriend did it. The execution was halted. Lawyers rushed to the prison. My brother lay strapped to that gurney for two hours while they verified the confession. The victim's mother collapsed. Her husband had killed her daughter to hide that he was molesting her other daughter. When they finally unstrapped my brother, he could barely stand. We held each other for 20 minutes. My family tried to apologize to him, but he didn't say a word to them. He walked out that night, free. After 15 years for a murder he didn't commit?

My brother Kevin and I made a pact when we were teenagers. The kind of dark humour only siblings share. We were watching our dad mow the lawn on Saturday afternoon when Kevin said, when I die, I want them to play Celebration at my funeral. Really confuse everyone. Then he got serious. Actually, if any of us ever play Celebration at a funeral, it means something's really wrong. Like emergency level wrong. I asked why we need a signal like that, and he shrugged. Weird things happen. If you hear that song at a funeral, you'll know someone needs help. We shook on it and never brought it up again. Twenty years later, dad collapsed at work and got diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. The doctors gave him three months, maybe four. Kevin's wife, Nicole, was a hospice nurse, and when she offered to coordinate Dad's care, my parents were relieved. Nicole set up the hospital bed, created medication schedules, and help my parents understand the medical terminology. I lived two states away and could only visit on weekends, so knowing Nicole was handling everything gave me peace of mind. Dad was still himself at first, still cracking jokes and insisting he'd beat this. And the pain got worse and the morphine increased. Dad started sleeping more, fading in and out. Nicole said this was Normal progression. When dad died six weeks after diagnosis, we were heartbroken, but not surprised. The doctor said sometimes it happens faster than expected. Funeral home. When the director asked about music, Kevin stared at the table for a long moment before saying quietly, for the closing song, I want Celebration by cool and the gang. My heart stopped. Nicole touched his shoulder gently. Honey, maybe something more traditional. Your father loved classical music. Kevin blinked like he was coming out of a fog. Yeah, you're right. Whatever you think. But I'd already heard it. The signal. I caught him alone afterward. Why did you request that song? He looked exhausted. I don't know. My brain isn't working right. Kevin, that was our signal. He stared at me blankly. What signal? Something about his empty expression bothered me. I kept thinking about how fast dad had declined. Two weeks when they'd said three or four months. I called the hospice doctor. Is it normal for pancreatic cancer to progress that quickly? It can be. Your father's care was managed appropriately according to the notes I received from his home nurse. I looked through dad's medication logs at my parents house. Every dose documented, timed, signed. The morphine had been increased three times in the final two weeks. Increase noted with per hospice doctor recommendation. You look professional and thorough. I texted Kevin asking to talk. Nicole answered his phone. He's resting. I gave him something to help him sleep. You Gave him something? He's having a breakdown and needs medication. I'm his wife and a medical professional. She hung up. I drove to Kevin's house and didn't bother knocking. Just tried the door. It was unlocked. Kevin was sitting on the couch with unfocused eyes. Kevin, what did she give you? He tried to focus. I don't. No. She said it would help. Nicole walked in and stopped when she saw me. What did you give him? Anxiety medication prescribed by his doctor. Show me the bottle. She pulled out a prescription bottle. Lorazepam. Prescribed to Nicole, not Kevin. This? This is your medication? I'm sharing it with my husband, who needs it. He requested that song before you started drugging him. Her face changed. I'm helping him cope. He was trying to tell me something. And now you're keeping him quiet. I pulled out my phone with photos of dad's medication logs. The morphine increases. Walk me through them. She glanced at the pages. The hospice doctor approved every increase. But you requested them based on dad's pain levels. I was there two days before he died. He wasn't in severe pain. Pain can be internal. You're not a medical professional. Neither was the

I married Kelly four years ago. Her son Jake was 8 back then. His real dad left when he was 3 and barely calls anymore. Maybe once every few months, if Jake's lucky. I never tried to replace the guy. I figured Jake would come around when he was ready. But he always just called me by my name. Ryan. Just Ryan. Never dad. It bothered me more than I wanted to admit. I'd hear other kids at soccer practice yell, dad, did you see that? And I'd look up automatically, then remember, Jake would never call me that. He'd just wave and yell, Ryan! Across the field. I'd wave back and pretend it didn't sting. Last Saturday, Jake asked if I could take him and his friends to six flags. School was out, and they've been planning this trip for weeks. I said yes immediately. I always said yes when Jake asked me to do stuff with him. Kelly jokes that I'm too easy on him, but I don't care. Anytime he wants me around. Feels like a win. The morning of the trip, I pulled up to his friend Mason's house. First, Mason jumped in the back seat talking about roller coasters. Then we got Owen, who brought a backpack full of snacks his mom packed. Jake sat in the front seat messing with the radio the whole time, playing terrible music I pretended to hate, but secretly Didn't mind. Then we pulled up to the last house. A kid I've never seen before came running out. He had braces and was wearing a band shirt that was way too big for him. He turned to me and said, this is Connor. He just moved here last month. Connor opened the door and threw his backpack in. He looked at me and said, who's this? Jake didn't even hesitate. This is my dad. I froze. My hands were still on the steering wheel. I looked at Jake, and he was staring straight ahead, acting like he hadn't just said the most important thing he'd ever said to me. I couldn't stop smiling. My face hurt from smiling. I tried to play it cool, but I'm sure I look like an idiot. Jake glanced over at me and saw my face, rolled his eyes, but he was smiling, too. Don't be weird about it, he muttered. I'm not being weird, I said, still grinning like crazy. You're definitely being weird, Owen said from the back. The whole car ride to six flags, I couldn't stop replaying it in my head. My dad, he said. My dad. Not Ryan. Not my mom's husband. My dad. Connor didn't even question it. Nobody did. It was just a fact. Now we got to the park, and the kids ran ahead to the biggest roller coaster. I bought the tickets and followed behind, watching Jake laugh with his friends. He looked back once. To make sure I was still there, I gave him a thumbs up, and he shook his head like I was embarrassing, but he was still smiling. They dragged me on every ride. This spinning one that made Owen nearly throw up. The drop tower that had Mason screaming the entire way down. Jake kept checking to make sure I was having fun. Like, suddenly, my opinion mattered more than it did yesterday. After lunch, they spotted one of those game booths, kind where you throw baseballs at stacked bottles, and the prizes are giant stuffed animals nobody actually needs. Jake wanted this huge stuffed tiger that was hanging from the top of the booth. It was bright orange and ridiculous. I'm gonna win that. Jake announced he paid five

When Nadia moved in 6 months ago, I hadn't had an episode in over two years. My meds were working perfectly. My psychiatrist even said I was one of her success stories. Life was stable, predictable, safe. And the whispers started only when she was nearby, quiet, muttering, just loud enough to catch but never clear enough to understand. I'd turn around and she'd look concerned, tilt her head, ask if I was okay, like she cared. The first few times I brushed it off. Maybe I was imagining things. Maybe my brain was playing tricks on me again. But it kept happening every single day. After my first breakdown in years, I was lying in bed silently crying, telling myself it's just her. I'm not insane. Clara found me like that and I finally told her everything. She immediately defended her sister. Nadia would never do that. He loves you. Maybe we need to call Doctor Patterson and adjust your medication. But here's what didn't add up. The whispers only happened around Nadia. Never when Clara and I were alone, never at my office, never at the grocery store or the gym. Only when her sister was in the room, in the hallway, in the kitchen cooking dinner. I started paying attention, really paying attention. Nadia would mutter to herself while doing dishes, pause randomly in doorways like she was Listening to something move her lips without making any sound while staring at nothing, all while watching me from the corner of her eye. Whenever Clara left the room, my doctor adjusted my meds three times over the next few months, higher doses, different combinations. Nothing changed. The whispers continued like clockwork. I felt like I was going insane all over again. The worst part wasn't even the whispers. It was watching Clara pull away from me. She'd look at me with this mixture of pity and fear like I was broken beyond repair. Nadia played her role perfectly, concerned sister in law, worried family member. Last Tuesday evening, I was walking down the hallway when I heard it clearly for the first time. You're losing it. Crystal clear, unmistakable, her voice. I rounded the corner into the kitchen where she stood with a glass of water looking completely innocent. Something in me just snapped. I yelled at her, told her to quit the charade and just, I asked her why she was doing this to me, what she could possibly gain from destroying my mental health, from ruining my marriage. She stared at me for exactly 3 seconds and burst into tears and ran out of the house. I knew immediately she was calling Clara. My wife hates being interrupted at work. I could only imagine how angry she'd be about this confrontation. I paced the living room for two hours until I saw both of them pull into The driveway together. Nadia had that perfect victim look on her face, red eyes, trembling hands, Clara's arm protectively around her shoulders. That night, Clara sat me down she was struggling to understand everything that was happening, that it broke her heart to see me suffer. But it was just as hard to hear such serious accusations against her sister. Then she suggested I check into a psychiatric ward, said we needed professional help beyond what she could provide at home.

It matured last year. This is my net worth verified by my accountant. It's all documented. Ryan was staring at the page like it was written in another language. You never told me. You never asked. You assumed because I don't wear designer clothes or drive a luxury car that I was broke. I'm not. I'm just careful. I flipped to the next section. My prenup is simple. What's mine stays mine. What's yours stays yours. But here's the interesting part. I pointed to Clause 7. If you cheat, you forfeit any claim to assets acquired during the marriage. If your family interferes in our marriage, harasses me or attempts to control financial decisions, you forfeit your share of our joint accounts. Trisha stood up. This is ridiculous. No, this is Protection. You taught me that five minutes ago. I looked at Ryan. You sat there while your mother insulted me, implied I was a gold digger, made me sign a document designed to humiliate me. Now you sign mine or there's no wedding. You can't be serious. His sister said, I'm completely serious. Ryan has 48 hours to have his attorney review it and sign. If he doesn't, I'm done. I stood up, collected both prenup and looked at Patricia. You wanted to protect your son from someone who'd use him for money. Congratulations. You just discovered I don't need his money. Question is, does he need mine? I left the Restaurant. Ryan called 14 times that night. I didn't answer. The next day, his attorney called mine. They wanted to negotiate. I refused. Find it as is or walk away. Ryan showed up at my apartment that evening. Why didn't you tell me, tell you what, that I'm successful, would it have mattered? He was quiet. My mother thought, your mother thought I was beneath you. You let her think it. You didn't defend me. You didn't ask questions. You just assumed she was right. I'll sign it, he said. But will you marry someone who let his family treat you like that? He didn't have an answer. Two days later, Ryan signed. So did I. We got married three months later. Small ceremony. His family wasn't invited. Patricia sent a letter. You've turned our son against us. I wrote back, no, I showed your son what respect looks like. You just didn't recognize it. Ryan and I are still married, 4 years now, happy. His family rarely calls. When they do, Ryan handles it. Last month, Patricia asked if we'd consider buying investment property with them. Ryan declined. We keep our finances separate from family. It's in the prenup. When he hung up, he looked at me. Thank you for teaching me that love doesn't mean losing yourself. I kissed him. That's not love. That's just common sense.

I was walking to the bus stop after a work meeting when the rain started. At first it was just a drizzle, so I walked faster. Then it turned into a complete downpour. I had no umbrella, no jacket with a hood, nothing. My hair was getting soaked and water was dripping down my neck into my shirt. I was trying to speed walk without actually running because I didn't want to look stupid. That's when I heard footsteps behind me getting closer. Someone was running toward me. A guy's voice said, excuse me, do you want me to help? I turned my head slightly but didn't really look at him. I said, no thanks, I'm fine. But he was already pulling his umbrella over both of us. He said, it's absolutely pouring. You're gonna get drenched. The umbrella covered us both and I immediately felt relief from the rain stopping. I said, thank you, I really appreciate it. He was tall, maybe 6 foot something. I'm only 5 foot 4, so the umbrella was mostly at his height. We walked together for a bit. I was looking down at the sidewalk, watching puddles form. My work shoes were getting splashed, but at least my head was dry. Now I adjusted my glasses because they were covered in water drops. These are my teaching glasses, the ones I only wear at work. They're big and kind of dorky looking with thick frames. I don't usually care, but today they felt extra awkward. After about 30 seconds of us walking, I looked up at him to say thank you again and smile. That's when he actually saw my face straight on for the first time. His expression changed instantly. His eyes went wide for a second and his mouth opened slightly like he was surprised or confused. He stopped walking. I stopped, too. There was this weird silence where we just stood there and rain was hammering the umbrella above us. Then he said, never mind. Just like that. Never mind. He pulled the umbrella away from covering.

I stood there getting rained on again, not understanding what just happened. He didn't say sorry or give an excuse. He just walked away in a different direction holding his umbrella over only himself. I watched him go. My hair got soaked again immediately what I ran down my face and I couldn't tell if some of it was tears or just rain. I kept walking to the bus stop alone. My shirt was completely wet and sticking to my skin. I thought about what had just happened. I replayed the moment he saw my face, the look he gave me. It wasn't like he suddenly remembered something or got a phone call. He specifically looked at my face and decided I wasn't worth helping anymore. I have some moles on my cheeks that are kind of dark and raised. I also have a double chin that gets worse when I look down. Today I didn't wear makeup because I was tired from staying up late finishing reports. Maybe I looked worse than usual. Maybe he expected someone prettier when he offered to help. When I got to the bus stop, I sat on the bench so fucking wet. An older woman was there with an umbrella and she looked at me. She asked if I was okay. I said yeah, just got caught in the rain. She didn't offer to share her umbrella either, but at least she didn't pretend to help first. The bus took 15 minutes to come. By the time I got on, I looked like I had jumped in a pool, fully clothed. People stared at me. I found a seat in the back and water dripped from my hair onto the floor. I got home and stood in the bathroom looking at myself in the mirror. I took off my glasses and wipe the water off them. I looked at my face trying to see what he saw. The moles, the double chin, my wet hair stuck to my head. No makeup so my skin looked uneven and tired. I touched one of the moles on my left cheek. It's been there since I was a kid. I used to not care about it. Now I wondered how many people look at me and decide I'm not worth their time, not worth common kindness.

Everyone agreed. I signed it, smiled and said, now sign mine. Her son's face went pale. The prenup landed on the table between the salad and main course, the family dinner. My future mother in law, Patricia, slid it towards me with two fingers like it was contaminated. Sign this or there's no wedding. We need to protect Ryan's assets. Ryan sat beside her, silent, not defending me, not even looking at me. His father nodded approvingly. His sister smirked into her wine glass. I picked up the document and read it. Standard, anything Ryan owned before marriage stayed his. Anything acquired during marriage would be split 70, 30 in his favor. If we divorced within 10 years, I'd get nothing. I'd leave with exactly what I came with. I looked up at Patricia. You think I'm after his money? you're smart enough to know a good opportunity when you see one. She wasn't wrong about me being smart. I was a corporate attorney. I'd spent seven years drafting contracts that protected executives worth hundreds of millions. Ryan worked in his father's commercial real estate business. Comfortable, but not wealthy. Not compared to what I've seen. Not compared to what I was worth. I pulled a pen from my purse and signed every page, dated it, slit it back, done. Patricia blinked. She'd expected a fight, tears, some dramatic exit. She could tell her Friends about. Instead, I reached into my bag and pulled out my own document, 40 pages bound, professional. Now Ryan signs mine. Ryan's face strained. What is that? My prenup? If I'm signing yours, you're signing mine. That's only fair, Patricia laughed. You don't have assets to protect. I smiled. Actually, I do. I opened to the financial disclosure page and slid it across the table. Patricia's laugh died. Ryan leaned forward reading. His father adjusted his glasses. The number at the bottom was clear, $3.2 million. That's not possible, Patricia whispered. You're a lawyer. You're 31. I'm a senior partner at Barrett and Thompson. I made partner at 29.

So I printed out an eviction notice because that was my food and my house. I moved to this expensive city with my parents two years ago, fresh out of college with a software engineering degree and I landed a six figure remote job within weeks. My parents are both high school teachers mind they make about half what I do. We got a three bedroom condo together. My name went on the mortgage because my credit score was 780 and theirs was not. I cover 75% of everything, mortgage, utilities, internet, groceries, you name it. They contribute what they can and we made it work. The third bedroom became my home office. I'm remote full time so I need the space. A desk, dual monitors, the whole setup. We kept an air mattress in there for guests and last month my older brother James calls his wife Mary is pregnant. Surprise, they're still living in our home state, barely making ends meet. My mom without asking me invites them to move in with us, says family helps family. They show up three days later with a U Haul. First thing James says when he walks in, which one's our room? He's looking at my bedroom, the master with the walk in closet and private bathroom. I laugh and say the office. There's an air mattress. And plenty of space. Once we move my desk, my mom immediately jumps in. Don't be selfish. They're having a baby. They need the bigger room. I look at my dad, he won't make eye contact. I remind everyone that I pay most of the bills here, that my name is on the mortgage, that I need my office for work. My mom calls me a selfish jerk. My brother says, I've always had it easy and this is the least I can do. I tell them if they want my room, I'll move out completely and they can figure out how to cover my 75% on their own. That shuts everyone up. They take the office for a few days. It's tense but manageable. I forget my laptop one morning and come home during lunch to grab it. I walk in and find Mary in my bedroom packing my clothes into boxes. My bathroom products are already in a trash bag. He's humming to herself like this is totally normal. What the hell are you doing? She jumps but recovers quickly. Your mom said I can start moving our stuff in. You're at work anyway. So I figured, get out now. Excuse me. I start grabbing my stuff from the boxes and throwing her things into the hallway. You have until five PM to get your stuff out of this room or I'm calling the police. She starts crying and calls my brother, then my mom, then my Brother again, my phone blows up. The entire afternoon at work, my dad starts a group chat. Family meeting tonight. Everyone be home by 6. I stop at Home Depot on the way back and buy a doorknob with a key lock. When I get home, they're all sitting on the couch like some kind of intervention panel. My brother immediately stands up and gets in my face trying to intimidate me. I'm 6 3. He's 5 9 on a good day. I put my hand on his forehead and just push him backward. He stumbled.

As everyone applauded, my grandmother sniffed, some people just aren't academic. I should have kept my mouth shut and grabbed another beer, but I've been listening to this crap for two hours straight, and honestly, I was done. See, I'm the family disappointment. The one they whisper about at Christmas dinner. Twenty six years old, dropped out of college sophomore year. Work construction, live in a cramped studio apartment above Mrs. Nguyen's Chinese restaurant. The free smell never really goes away. Meanwhile, my cousin Luke's the family's golden child. Harvard bound with a full scholarship, honors program, pre med track. Kids been getting straight A's since kindergarten, while I was getting detention slips. The reunion was at Uncle Steve's house in the suburbs. You know the type. Perfect lawn, two car garage, little solar lights lining the driveway. I rolled up in my beat up Ford pickup, oil stains on the concrete, feeling like I was contaminating their property values just by existing. Everyone was gathered around the backyard deck when I arrived. The adults had claimed the patio furniture, while kids ran around with water balloons, screaming their heads off. Classic rock blasted from someone's Bluetooth speaker, competing with the sizzle of burgers on Uncle Steve's oversized grill. There's Luke's future, Aunt Janet announced, waving a wine glass as I walked up. She was already three drinks in, cheeks flushed pink. Harvard Medical School, Here we come! Luke stood in the center of it all, tall and lean now, hair perfectly styled like some college recruitment poster. Don was the awkward kid with braces. I remembered this version looked like he belonged in a catalog for successful people. We're so proud, Uncle Steve added, bringing a burger with unnecessary flare. Full ride scholarship, you know. They're practically paying him to attend. My mom spotted me lurking by the cooler and waved me over. She was wearing her nervous smile, the one she gets when she's worried I'm going to embarrass the family again. Luke's been telling us about orientation week, he said, trying to include me in the conversation. Sounds amazing, right? I nodded and cracked open a coarse light, letting the condensation drip onto my steel toed boots. The same boots that had been caked with MUD that morning crawling under a house to run electrical lines. You know, Aunt Janet continued, gesturing dramatically, Luke's going to be a doctor. A real doctor. Finally, someone successful in this family. The comment hit like a slap.

Luke just stood there soaking it up, that smug little grin spreading across his face like he'd won the lottery. Not everyone can be book smart, Uncle Steve added, glancing my way with what I'm sure he thought was sympathy. Some people are more hands on. That's when Grandma Helen, perched in her lawn chair like some judgmental queen, looked directly at me and delivered the line that finally broke my patience. Some people just aren't academic. The whole backyard went dead quiet. 20 something relatives, all eyes on me, waiting for me to shrink away like I always did, waiting for me to mumble something about needing another beer and disappear into the house. Instead, I pulled out my phone and opened my banking app. My hands were surprisingly steady. You're absolutely right, grandma, I said, turning the screen toward the crowd. I'm not academic at all. The bank statement showed my checking account balance and more importantly, last month's deposit. The number seemed to glow on the screen. Luke squinted at my phone and his face went completely white. That's, that's impossible. Union electrician, I explained calmly, taking a sip of beer. Specialized in high voltage industrial work, power plants, manufacturing facilities, the dangerous stuff nobody else wants to touch. Aunt Janet's wine glass was frozen halfway to her mouth. Uncle Steve had stopped flipping burgers entirely. I clear about 15 grand a month. I can continued sometimes More if there's overtime or emergency calls. Turns out people pay really well for someone willing to work with electricity that can literally kill you. The silence was so complete, I could hear the neighbor's dog barking three houses down. But hey, I said, raising my beer toward Luke. I'm sure Harvard's great, too, buddy. Maybe in four years of undergrad, then four years of med school, then however many years of residency, maybe you'll catch up. Luke looked like he was going to be sick. Grandma Helen was staring at her hands. Even the kids had stopped screaming in the pool. Anyway, I said, draining my beer. I should get going early. Job tomorrow, we're installing backup generators at the hospital, you know, keeping the lights on for future doctors. I set down my empty bottle and walked toward my truck, leaving 27 relatives in stunned silence behind me. For once, I was the one walking away with my head held high.

I was half asleep during history class when the intercom buzzed to life. Principal Garcia's voice sounded different. Tense, almost shaky. Attention, all students. We're implementing an immediate lockdown. This is not a drill. My teacher's face went pale. She rushed to lock the door, whispering, get away from the windows, now! We huddled in the corner, my heart pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat. Someone's phone buzzed with a News Alert. Active shooter reported at nearby Harrison High. Five minutes later, another announcement. The threat may be headed to our campus. Police are on their way. A girl beside me started crying silently. I texted my mom, I love you, just in case. The classroom window. I spotted police cars flooding the parking lot. Officers with huge guns ran toward the building. Check your phones, my teacher whispered, but keep them silent. A text from my brother in another classroom. Someone said they saw a car that matches the description parked behind the cafeteria. My friend grabbed my arm so tight it hurt. My sister works in the office, she whispered. She says they're checking the security cameras, and there's someone in a black hoodie walking around the music hall. The intercom crackled again. Principal Garcia, voice trembling. Remain in lockdown. Police are searching the building. We sat in terrified silence for almost two hours. My legs cramped. The girl next to me had to pee, so Bad. She was crying. Our teacher finally let her use the trash can behind her desk. While we all looked away, someone whispered they heard shouting from the hallway. Another kid swore he heard a gunshot, but I wasn't sure. My phone battery was at 12%. From constantly refreshing news sites. I heard, the guy has a list of names. A boy behind me whispered, people he's targeting. I thought about every mean comment I'd ever made. Every person I might have hurt without realizing it. Would I be on someone's list? Finally, another announcement. Threat has been contained. Police will escort each classroom to the gymnasium. When the officers came to our door, one of them had a dog. They made us leave our backpacks and walk single file with our hands visible. The hallway felt endless in Jim. Rumors spread like wildfire. The shooter had been caught. No, it was a false alarm. No, they found weapons in a student's car. Parents were texting their kids conflicting information. Principal Garcia took a microphone, looking exhausted. Her blazer was wrinkled and her usual perfect hair was falling out of it.

Um, so I have a question, which is also kind of a disagreement, but I wanna build it up. Okay, so of course you just said Jesus is the most important thing for everyone out here. And so can you please explain to everyone out here what Jesus stood for? And especially the qualities of love. How to love your neighbor even if they don't agree with you. So what. What is your name again? Talis. Talis, that's a beautiful question. I'm glad you came up to ask it. But I wanna also just add something, cause you're right. Jesus fully embodied two things simultaneously. That showed his divine and his godly nature. Cause not thus, Jesus said good things. Jesus is Lord, Christ is king. And Jesus is god. On top of just being a guy with a lot of good ideas. Yeah. So John 8, if I'm drawing from memory correctly, best embodies both Christ's mercy and love, but also his commitment to truth. And sometimes in the modern gospel, we overemphasize the Grace and we underemphasize the truth. Yeah. And so we are far too willing to say, hey, Jesus loves everybody, but we don't get to the second part of the conversation. Says, Jesus doesn't want you to live in sin. So this is in John 8, it's best embodied. Right. Almost every Christian in this audience will be Able to tell you the first part of this, which is a bunch of Sadducees and Pharisees are sitting around, standing around with rocks, and they're about to stone, um, the prostitute woman. And Jesus comes up and says, let the first among you without sin cast the first stone. And everyone starts dropping the rocks. But what comes next shows that Christ is not just Grace focused, he's simultaneously truth focused. He goes up to the woman who had a career in selling herself for sex and said, sin no more. Now imagine today how much trouble you would get in if you would go up to somebody and say, stop sinning that well, you're being too judgmental. No, no, you're actually being Christlike. So Jesus stood. He was 100% Grace and truth. And that tension is very hard in a modern world because we want to overemphasize Grace, when in reality, Christ loves us too much to have us continue to live in sin. He wants us to try to elevate our actions to glorify god and all that we do. I agree 100%. Um, and so to build on my question, I really want to talk about D E I. And so with our Christian, I will agree with you. A lot of I read the Bible for myself, so I knew what that Scripture said. But my question is, how can Christian teachings on love, equity and justice inform and shape discussions on diversity, equity and Inclusion in today's society. And so to also, Jesus hung out with sinners. He did not judge, he told the truth. And so I think that a lot of people in society today, when we talk about political views that are opposition, we judge them because we think, oh, because you voted for Trump.

My mom's conservative and my dad's a Liberal. And my mom is always kind of pushing me to bring politics into my life. And I was wondering, a, should I care and if I should, why? And which parent should I lean more towards? Got it. So did you say Mom's Liberal? Mom's conservative? Oh, wow. Okay. That's, that's opposite I would have thought. Okay. So I, I see you have a shirt here that says who, whom shall I send? Here I am, right? Yes. Um, which I love. That is the Hebrew word heinani, which appears many times throughout the scriptures. Uh, when Abraham, the binding of Isaac, Moses at the burning bush, the call of Isaiah, the call of Samuel, every believer here in the audience, by the way, the most important thing is to bring Jesus into your life. Let me just make sure I say that. Most important thing. It's way more important than politics. It's the most important thing. Amen. And so I encourage every believer out here to learn what that word heinani means. It means, Lord, use me, send me. And I could tell you're probably going through a trial right now cause your parents are separate and it's not easy. So the scriptures are very clear about this. Uh, Christianity has a heavy emphasis on honoring your parents. Now, to contrast that with the prior questioner, I don't think she's doing a good job of honoring her parents cause she's accusing them of being in a cult. Yeah, even, this is for a very important, everybody, even if your parents share values and views and a worldview that you do not have, you are biblically obligated to honor them, which means to spend time with them and to love on them and to go visit them, even if they are wearing a black lives matter and in this home that we have no hate and trans lives, you still go and spend time with your parents. Because if you are incapable in this case of honouring your earthly father, you will never honour your heavenly father. And it's very clear in the Ten Commandments, and I'll get back down to the specific advice in the Ten Commandments, it is the only commandment, honor your mother and father so that you may live long in the land of which you are in. It is the only commandment that deals with a promise and your country. You will cease to have a strong country, America, if we do not have kids honoring their parents. You, everyone out there, every day, you, you should call your parents on a weekly basis. I know college exists a lot of the times to separate children from the parents. They want to try to separate you from your upbringing. Your parents aren't cool. They don't understand you. They don't share your values. The closer that you stay with your parents, even though you have disagreements.

Okay, so do you mean legislate control over women? Yeah, yeah, specifically with abortion, taking away her right to choose. Got it. Okay. So I'm sure if I ask this question, the answer will be no. But you would say, does a mother have the right to kill her child, not kill? But I, what I'm trying to raise awareness right now is that we need to abolish child neglect laws because that forces women to use their bodies even with babies. Now, I'm not saying they should be allowed to kill babies, but I'm saying they should be allowed to let nature just take its course, for example, that we're, I'm just saying we, we are saying that it's survival of the fittest. And what I'm saying is I think that the MAGA fascist, I think you all are winning because, because you at least are trying to be consistent on the life issue. But what I'm saying is we need to be as progressive consistent. That's why I've got this, this, uh, petition here to get people to see that we must abolish child neglect laws if we're gonna be consistent that it really is her body and her choice. So I, I, I, I think, uh, I think you're doing a very good job exposing the hypocrisy left. I could tell that this is, uh, a stick and I will say, um, it's very Effective and I tend to agree with where you're trying to go. What he, what he, they, them, whatever is saying is the following, which is to abolish child neglect laws is the furthest extrapolation of a pro abortion view, which is consistent, of course. No, and I don't know what you actually believe, but your satire can sometimes lead you towards truth. And you should show like what he's, what, what he, or, yeah, show the poster. What he's saying in a way is that in order for the left, he doesn't actually believe this. This is a stick. I, yeah, got it. Fine. Yeah. Um, but what, what he's doing is trying to prove a point that if you are pro choice, then therefore you should also get rid of child neglect laws because it means you actually don't care for the baby, whether it be in the womb or outside of the womb. And so we are forcing women to use their bodies. Sure. I got it. So, uh, very good. Thank you and best of luck with your petition. Thank you.

Taylor. Taylor, thank you for coming up. Can you give me two things that you don't agree with Trump on? Or would you like me to try to win you over for Trump? So you're not gonna be able to do that, but I appreciate it. Well, then you're not open minded. Um, so. Well, first of all, if you say that there's nothing you can then here to win be won over for Trump, then you gotta give me a good reason, at least two, why you don't like Trump. He's racist. Oh my god. Yep. Boomy. Use Google example. Thank you guys. Okay, so let me ask you a dumb question. Uh huh. Can you. Can you define what does it mean to be racist? Haha. Do you. Do you want me to look up a definition? I want you to. You. You said he's a racist, so yeah, you must. You must have a definition of racism in your mind. Tell me what that definition is. Okay, so. Oh, I'm gonna make. Make you guys wait on this. Oh, zero knowledge. Guys, please don't heckle. Just. I'm. I'm. I want to try to understand because these words have a lot of meaning. Yeah, but you can't get. I know it's hard on the spot. I just want you to think about it. Because if you say Trump is a racist, you should be able to easily give a definition of what that Word means. So it's hatred towards another race. Right. So when has he ever exhibited that? Give me clear and specific examples. You got one? Um. Well, yeah, I heard someone say he told a. Told. Yes. Okay, but let me just help you out here. Uh huh. What? You think he's a racist cause the media has told you he's a racist? Because you can't give me an example off the top of your head. And even when you phone a friend of the audience, not. I'm not criticizing you. Maybe the media is lying to you. Maybe the man who's being called a racist is actually someone that's trying to improve lives of all Americans. I think this is fun, guys. So. Okay, so let me just ask one. One final question for you. Yeah. Um. Which is you. You say you are Liberal. Yeah. Right. And you say you lean to the left. Yeah. Are. Are you open minded to have your mind changed on your core. On your core political principles? On my core political principles or philosophical? If it's a fact, then sure. Cool. So can I give you a fact? I want you to think about Kamala Harris as she's been in charge of the border. We have 320,000 missing children right now in this country that were all sex traffic or labor traffic across the southern border. Do you agree that that should probably get more attention? I think any type of issue Like that should get attention. Have you heard about that before? Me mentioning it? Not really. Like I said, I don't really know that much. No, I know. No, but hold on. But you had. You knew enough to say Trump was a racist. Why do you think you don't know that? There's 320,000 missing kids in America? Why is that? It's not really presented in the media. The media is so focused right now on the battle between conservative and Liberal. But isn't that a core part of the battle? That the Liberal vice president has allowed 320,000 kids to go missing? So how is she allowed that, exactly? That's a good question. She's in charge of the border. She has stopped DNA testing at the border. So if a kid comes to the border, 12 years old, and someone says, I'm their father, there's no DNA rapid test. That takes 90 seconds to make sure that's actually the father. Most times it's a pimp that is selling the girl into sex slavery. In the interior of the United States. Kamala Harris specifically got rid of that policy. So it was in place before? Yes. When Donald Trump was president. It required DNA testing, and families would remain together, and they were not granted asylum into the interior of the country. And we had remained in Mexico. The lowest border crossings in American history. Under Kamala Harris, we have 10 million people coming illegally into America. Okay, next person. All right, I want you to think about these things. And maybe one day you'll remember this conversation. And you'll think back that maybe conservatives have been right all along. Thank you.

Can you name me the only black Supreme Court justice? Yeah, I just told you, buddy. It's not irrelevant because it doesn't matter to you. How was the church during slavery? I'm curious. What is the difference between a white person and a black person? We're getting off topic. No, no, this is your topic, my friend. You know, you're now starting to retreat a little bit because it's not going well. The only distinction I will accept is the male female distinctions. I actually think that one matters. I love that you have to retreat to, like, the biblical male female. I actually, I get it. I didn't. How's it going, Charlie? I love the show. I listen all the time. No joke. I've been listening to about five to 10 hours a week of conservative talk radio since the summer of 2008. Yeah, that's just as a fun. I did. I just, you know, um, there was something going on the summer of 2008. I can't remember. This new lady was breaking out onto the scene. Big conservative star. Um, is she still in the party? She was a governor of Alaska. I can't remember her name. Hold on. Sarah. Sarah something. No, no. Anyway, no, my question is really quick. I just, I'll, I'll be really brief. I would love it if you could just name, uh, two black Republican senators. Um, well, there is one that I know of. Tim Scott. Yeah. Can you name a second one? Uh, I'm not sure there is a second. Maybe you could correct me if I'm wrong. there's not. No, there's not. Yeah. So it's a trick question. Yeah. How about this? Can you name me the only black Supreme Court justice? Actually, there's two of them. Well, it's not a trick question. It's a trick. It's a question to try to prove a point. So other than Byron Donalds. Other than Byron Donalds, can you name another black, uh, publican Congress person? Yeah. Wesley Hunt. Okay. Do you know what the percentage of black Republican representation in the Republican side of Congresses? Do you know what that number is? It's. It's not very high, but it's not very high. No, it's about a fraction of a fraction. No, no, no, hold on. But what? Okay, that's interesting. No, but I'm curious. But I'm curious because I've heard you in other videos. You say, what's the total black population of the United States? It's roughly 13%. So 13 to 14% of the constituents are represented by point zero zero one % on your side. Now I'm curious about this one. What's the percentage of the United States citizens who are Christian? Who identify as Christian? Um, probably 50 to 55%. What's the percentage of Christians who are Republican in Congress? Just curious. Um, it's. It's 100%. Haha. Well, hold on a second. Let me ask you a Question. Yeah, it's 100%. Hold on. So calm down. You've talked this entire time. No, but the presentation matters to you. hold on, wait one second. Let me. Matters. How have the Democrats done overseeing the black community the last 40 years? Are they wealthier? Richer, richer, happier? Everybody is made mistakes, bro. No, no, no, no. Answer the question. I'm answering the. I. Just answer the question. There has been successes and there's been failures, but on your side. Let me, can I ask you this. Let me ask you this question. The other what. What's success? So, so Tim Scott, the. But this is the best way to do this. So I'm an alumnae. I hope that's okay. Um, or we can say to alumnae, yeah, um, sure. Yeah. Go Beavs! Go Beavs! I used to live in Blass Hall. Anyone in Blass Hall? Blass Hall blossoms all fucked up. I, I. That's sad that it's never changed. No. Um, so this is the other. This is maybe the better question. So in 2022, Herschel Walker would have become the very first black Republican Senate candidate to win a primary and a general election to serve their first term in office. As you know, Tim Scott was actually appointed to fill a vacancy and then won later. Right, right. But he won as an incumbent. And what's the incumbent see rate in Congress is? Anybody know that number? It's like 90 something. 96%, 97% incapacity. I'm Just curious, do you know when it's republic? Yeah, my question is do you? When do you. Cause it's not gonna happen this cycle. What cycle? Do you think Republicans will dominate and elect their first black Republican senator to serve? You know what's interesting? I think skin color is irrelevant. Why do you care so much about it? I just told you, buddy, it's not irrelevant because it doesn't matter to you. it's interesting though. But like, let. Let you say representation. You know what? The only. Stop it. The only representation that matters is values, not skin color. Oh, values. Yeah, right. Christian. Christian values are important to you because 100% of Republicans and Congress represent Christian values. Bingo. Black values are not important. What are black. I'm talking about the values of different communities. tell me what they are. Educate me on what black values are. That's. You're picking a stupid. You know what black values are? They're Christian. Cause they're one of the most Christian populations in the country. That's what black values are. How was the church during slavery? I'm curious, what did the church say about slavery? Well, yeah, they did. Yeah, but I'm pretty sure there were no. But help me understand what. What is the difference between a white person and a black person? We're getting off topic. No, no, this is your topic my friend. You know, you're now starting to retreat a little. Bit because it's not going well. Tell me what point. Which is? That you have your side. It doesn't prove any point. Really. Want to involve itself in anything other than white Christian culture, and that's represented. Wait, hold on. No, no, no. People that you bring to office. Let me explain to me then. Not just Wesley Hunt, but Anna Paulina Luna and the growing Republican Party in the Hispanic. Are any of them in any leadership positions on your committees? You guys do run a bunch of committees, right? I'm curious. Yeah. How many non white, non males are on Republican committees in Congress? Well, well, well, we got about 118 Congresses to pick from. Quite, quite a few, but yeah. The only distinction I will accept is the male female distinctions. I actually think that one matters, cause I think male female distinctions are important. 1 the left does not believe in. But I want you to tell the Bible, right? Yeah, well, it's also biology, you know, like X, x, x, y chromosomes. Yeah, you know, um. You do believe in male female distinction, right? I'm talking about. I love, I love that you have to retreat to like the biblical male female. I actually, I get it. I didn't, uh. You can see X, x, x, y in your, in your blood work, actually. How did we get on this topic? Because I'm talking about distinctions. So I want you to tell me though, You say that the Republican Party is under representing black America. Well, not just black Americans. Many other. I'm saying they're over representing white Christian culture. And that matters because it shows that that's what your value set is. I don't believe you have that amount of sense. What? What. What is white Christian culture? Tell me what that is. You're in. You're like it. You drip it in the morning when you get out of the shower, bro. Like, what are you talking about? Oh, hating women. Hating different people and, you know. Yeah. How do I hate women, exactly? Tell me how I hate women. Sir, I've listened to several hours of your program in a week. Give me one example. You're incredibly misogynistic. Give me a second example. Again. Can you give me a third example? Can you name any women? No, But on any leadership positions anywhere. I can. Yes. Senator from Mississippi. She. Senator Lemmon. Senator Lemmus from Wyoming is on a leadership committee. Senator Lemmus from Wyoming? Yeah. That's a. That's a yes. Also, when was the last time he had, like. Hold on a second. Also, Senator Katie Britt gave the response to the state of the union address, and she did a great job on that one, guys. You guys remember that? Okay, no, but tell me. You came out. We are suffering. Okay, so tell me. Very much fun. Tell me very clearly, though. Yeah, you. You. Said that I hate women and I'm misogynistic. Yeah. Can you give me an example? I can't. I don't have a specific example right now. I didn't. Yeah.

It's a deeply unsettling experience. The researchers poured a thick adhesive beside the man, spread it across his face, and used a fan to dry it in seconds. Once the coating hardened, they sliced a small opening and placed a custom pair of glasses on him. They assumed John would last only a few days, but no one expected him to remain trapped in the lab for so long. As the days dragged on, his his frustration grew, until he finally broke out. When he returned home, he caught a glimpse of his neighbor changing clothes, but at the last moment, she pulled the curtains shut. Staring at his own reflection, John suddenly understood. He had gained the power to disappear. And with that power, he could do almost anything he wanted. Not long after the woman finished her shower, a knock echoed through her front door. She checked outside and saw nothing, thinking it was just her imagination, until the doorbell chimed again. Confused, she opened the door only to find the hallway completely empty. But in that very moment, the unseen John had already slipped silently into her home.

It was a miniature pistol, a hidden weapon specially designed for assassins. On the overpass, the two engaged in an intense battle. Lisa moved quickly, agile and precise. But no matter how she attacked, she couldn't break through his defense. Time passed bit by bit, yet the situation remained unchanged. Her stamina was slowly drained and the rhythm of the fight began slipping from her control. Refusing to accept defeat, Lisa grabbed a stun baton and smashed it hard against the man's body. To her shock, even as the electric current intensified, he didn't let go. Seconds later, he countered with a reverse strike, knocking Lisa to the ground. The man slowly drew his pistol, his hand trembling slightly, aiming at Lisa's head. Just as he was about to pull the trigger, a toothpick suddenly shot into his arm. Reinforcements had arrived. The man leapt onto the assassin's shoulder. Their fighting styles were completely different. Lisa was like the wind, fast and agile. He was like a mountain, steady and unyielding. No matter how the assassin countered, he always found an opening and quickly retaliated. Within a few moves, the assassin was subdued before Lisa could even speak. To stop him, the man turned and left, clean and efficient, like the wind, as if he had never appeared at all.

Thirty five years later, he awoke in the middle of a rice field in a remote village somewhere in rural China. Strangers surrounded him and the language they spoke was completely unfamiliar. The boy, terrified, fainted on the spot. The villagers quickly contacted the US Embassy. When the staff checked his clothes, they discovered a tag with a handwritten name, Jacob. Astonishingly, the boy could recall his entire family address from memory. Soon after, he was sent back to the United States, delivered to the house he had written down. Detective Malik assigned to follow the case. Unable to believe the address actually existed, he knocked and a man in his 70s opened the door. Malik asked if the man had ever lost a son. The elder informed him that his child had died 35 years ago. But when he saw the boy, he froze. Jacob suddenly blurted out a nonsensical phrase rushed out at the speed of lightning like millions of miles per hour, like frogs spinning in a blender. The old man responded instinctively to the riddle. Seconds later, he realized that only he and his son had ever known this puzzle. Yet 35 years ago, he had buried his son with his own hands. The old man stood frozen, staring in disbelief.

Then with one confident stroke of a pen, he rewrote the date, adding 10 extra years to his life on paper. He trimmed the ruined receipt, lifted its name cleanly and pressed it carefully over the real one as if patching a new identity into place. Next came the step that mattered most. He pulled out a plane model he had soaked in water beforehand, peeled off the airline's tiny emblem and fixed it onto the corner of the receipt. Just like that, the counterfeit airline check was ready when he walked into the bank to cash it. The teller almost spotted the trick, almost, but his charm worked faster than her suspicion. Few gentle words, a smile and the check went through without a hitch. Success tasted good, too good. He bought more model airplanes, crafted more forge checks and even faked pilot credentials, turning paper into cash again and again. Each win made him bolder. Soon he was flying for free, slipping straight into cockpits as if he belonged among the crew. From then on, he traveled exclusively on that airline, cashing forged checks all across the country. One day while cashing another one, he struck up a conversation with a bank employee and quietly coaxed out details about their newest anti forgery measures. He headed straight to an auction afterward, purchased a professional grade printing machine and His operation, his entire scale expanded overnight.

I only did this to test whether he was really blind, because every night when I went to bed, I felt someone staring at me from behind, and there was a hole poked through the paper on the door, with faint breathing sounds outside. But whenever I opened the door to check, there was nothing out there. And besides me and the old man in this house, there was no other living thing. So I suspected he was pretending to be blind and watching me whenever I fell asleep. But when the 53 degree liquor hit his eyes, he he did not react at all. Then I tried another test. While helping him walk, I deliberately guided him the wrong way. I even put a bright floral coat on him and played with a knife right in front of him. But none of it worked. He acted exactly like a real blind man, which meant he could not be spying on me. To clear my doubts once and for all, I went to the village priest for help. After hearing everything, he swore the old man had been blind for decades and said it was impossible for him to do such things. He thought I was just too suspicious and told me to go back and take good care of him. But that very night after I returned, I Heard sounds outside the door again and another new hole appeared, so I grabbed my knife for Protection and quietly leaned toward the hole. No matter whether it was a person or a ghost, I was determined to find out this time. But when I opened the door, there was still no one outside. I started wondering if I was hallucinating. But as the days passed, more and more holes appeared in the door, and I looked worse and worse. Every day I tried new ways to test the old man, but could not find a single flaw, so I stopped sleeping at night and kept staring at the door. The moment I heard a sound outside, I opened the door with my knife in hand, and when I saw nothing I shut it fast, terrified something might slip in and hurt me. But this time when I turned around, I suddenly saw the old man lying on my bed.

Kelly slowly let her guard down against Jack. Jack LED Kelly to the depths of the secret passage. The chamber was filled with countless jewels, all kinds of expensive portraits and bottles. Jack told Kelly the real reason he was here. Then he wanted to use the wealth to help his descendants. Soon Kylie agreed to his request. The next day, the site was discovered.

Since the Department Education was formed in the 70s, we. We now have 50 years of evidence. Has American education gotten better since we've had a department of education or has it gotten worse? I personally don't think that that has to do with department of education. I. Well. Well, when you spend. When you've spent over four and a half trillion dollars with one Federal department. And we have 30 schools in Chicago where a 5th grader cannot read at grade level. We have 35 schools in Baltimore where kids cannot do math or reading at grade level. We have, cannot find a single school, not a single school in, in downtown Detroit where by the time they graduate high school in the heavily black areas, that they're proficient in reading or math. We are now like 31st in the industrialized world of education.

The red sorceress pressed her palms to the earth. Poisonous fungi erupted, and soldiers collapsed in toxic cloud. Another wave hit from Trisa's side. She clenched her fist, bones shattering all at once. Still they came. Jennifer commanded, ready the bomb! A vial flew. An arrow lit the fuse. Acidic fire rained down, burning armor and flesh alike.

Just then, a few workers from the truck arrived. Jesse immediately froze, pretending to be a doll. After confirming the doll was undamaged, the workers turned and left. Jesse's stomach growled loudly. Jason drove her out to get something to eat. She gazed in awe at the world 1,000 years later, fascinated by everything. She even food wrapped.

I've been following you since George Floyd, that whole thing went down. I want to preface my question by saying I voted for Donald Trump. But when students say that Donald Trump wants to rule like a fascist and then deport people like Abrigo Garcia without due process, I wanted to ask you, how can you call yourself an American patriot when the Supreme Court ruled 9 to 0 that the deportation was unlawful and that they are ordered to facilitate his return and haven't? How can I call myself an American patriot because a MS13 gang member, wife beating, child abusing foreign citizen was sent back to his country of origin pretty easily? That's what American patriots do. Secondly, the Supreme Court did not say that. They said 9 nothing that there was an administrative error that he could have been sent to any country except El Salvador. The fact was not that it was wrong that he was deported. It was just the fact that he was deported to the one country you cannot be deported to. Finally, I don't understand the emphasis and the concern and the hyperpathological fixation on why a foreign citizen who is a gang member gets all of the attention American left while you, the American people have been ignored by them over the last 30 years. It's creepy and it's bizarre. There are a lot of criticisms to be made that we have been ignored. But at The end of the day, number one, the 14th amendment grants uh, do process wrong. Yes, it does not, not under the alien enemy Zack. That's incorrect. Alien enemy Zack does not give you the same due process, right? Number one, he can. Okay. Number two, it was still, it was still underway while that happened. Number two, the Supreme Court ruled in 2019 under the Expedited Removal Act that you do not get full due process rights if you're within 100 miles of the border or 14 days of entry. And then number three, do you think that we should have 21 million trials for all the illegals that the Democrats landed?

The two held their breath, waiting quietly for the student to leave. As soon as the student was gone, Millie wrenched herself free from Tim's grasp. I'm sorry. But before they could even catch their breath, they heard footsteps approaching the bathroom again. Milly quickly gestured for Tim to climb onto the toilet, then took charge of dealing with whoever was outside. This time it was Mister Pete, their teacher. Millie instantly pretended to have a stomachache. Mister Pete didn't ask any extra questions, just told the other students to head out first, even though he noticed someone else was in the stall with her. He ultimately let Millie off the hook, only reminding her not to accidentally walk into the men's restroom again.

The next day, a woman accidentally scratched her wheel, and as she complained about having to buy a new tire, the man pulled out the purple crayon from his pocket and started drawing circles in the air. The next second, a tire appeared out of nowhere, saving the money. That night, the man wanted to show off the magical crayon in front of his son, so he casually drew a butterfly in the air. Then with a light blow, the butterfly flapped its wings, coming to life. At first, the boy was skeptical, but when he took the purple crayon and drew his favorite little animal and blew gently, the creature he drew came to life. Then, to make sure his son could also make wishes come true, the man gave him half of the crayon. Soon, the crayon was put to good use. After school, he was stopped by two bullies who then shoved him into the storage room. The boy suddenly remembered the purple crayon in his pocket, and the next second, a monster suddenly broke through the storage room door, scaring the bullies away as they quickly ran off. Back home, the sun said he wanted to fly in the sky, and the man thought it was a great idea, so he took out the purple crayon. And started drawing in an open space. He kept drawing, and soon the shape of an airplane appeared. Then the man pulled the propeller.

Woman, woman is a social construct that we've agreed upon. Typically, we imagine womanhood as makeup or whatever it is. There is a difference between the word woman and being a biological female. Woman is a social construct that we use. Listen for a second. I'm telling you what it means. Woman. Woman is a social construct. We agree on these set of preferences. If I tell you that I'm a man is because I want you to know that I like these set of preferences. If I tell you I'm a woman cause I want you to know that I agree with these set of preferences. Can men give birth? Can men, or can males, cause males can't these, listen for a second.

So I wanna thank you for proving a great point what you are, why we should eliminate the department of education. Thank you very much.

Luckily, once dinner ended, the lady went upstairs. The maid urgently whispered for her family to sneak out. But suddenly the homeowner's daughter heard the stair announcing she wanted a camp on the lawn. That in a flash the hiding family scrambled beneath the sofa, narrowly avoiding detection by the wealthy household. Another problem surf, how could they escape now? The daughter was already cozy inside or 10 outside while the rich couple lounged comfortably on the living room sofa above. The hidden family held there not daring to move. Only after the couple finally drifted into sleep did the family slowly slip out from under the sofa or the garage and escape through the villa's back door. As the saying goes, a downpour exposes the true divide between the wealthy and the poor. The rich stay high and dry on the hill while the poor pushed down, swept like debris into the city's underground drain. And when this family eventually returned home, the devastation was staggering. Their cramped semi basement was ruined, floodwater rising to their and in the midst of it, the woman was still playing a private game with her.

As the female boss delivered her presentation, her gaze kept drifting toward him. Matthew had a habit of causing trouble during work hours, giving the boss the perfect excuse to unleash her built up irritation. After all, Matthew was just a regular employee and could do nothing but quietly endure her hostility. Later that night, the office had emptied out, yet the boss remained behind, working overtime. Exhausted from a long day, she opened her computer and browsed some personal files to unwind. She had no idea that Matthew had returned to fetch a forgotten document. He stumbled upon her secret, discreetly snapped a photo and slipped away. The next morning, as she headed to the break room for coffee, Matthew called her over and revealed something on his phone. Panic hit her instantly and she hurriedly asked what he wanted. Matthew told her to meet him at a restaurant after work that evening. They met as arranged. Matthew handed her his phone. She quickly deleted the video, unaware that Matthew had already backed everything up. Then he made his request.

So he wanted to switch families. At this time, a boy who looked exactly like Bart had the same idea. You look like a dorky version of me. And you look like a dimwitted version of me. And you two are ten year old versions of me. This adult Bart had a wife who looked very much like Milhouse. You want to see pictures of our kids? Yeah! The boy who looked like Bart was named Simon. Simon's family was extremely wealthy, but he wasn't happy. Bart was very envious of Simon's wealthy lifestyle. Simon proposed that they swap identities. For a while, Bart was a bit hesitant. I'm pretty attached to my family. And get out of here, boy. When he heard Homer scolding, he agreed to Simon's proposal. The two exchanged clothes in the bathroom. They introduced each other to their family situations. After Bart changed into Simon's clothes, he walked toward the luxury car. He felt very smug seeing Simon getting beaten in his place. Driver, laugh at those people for me. My pleasure, sir. Haha. Luxury car drove to an upscale neighborhood. There were luxurious houses and celebrities living here. The luxury car finally stopped in front of the largest mansion. More than a dozen servants greeted Bart in the mansion. The swimming pool was large enough to hold two ships. The bedroom looked like an amusement park. Candy corn volcano, a ceiling from Saddam's palace. Oh, and A race car bed? They're really racist. Bart drove the race car bed and saw posters of sports stars. But these were actually real people standing there. Because this family had donated $1 million to their team. Back in the poster, Gabby. Yes, sir. Bart called his good friend Milhouse. Check out the caller ID on your phone. What number? That service is 3 65 a month. You switch places with a millionaire kid who looks just like you. Just sit tight. I'm sending a car on the other side. Simon, who was used to eating lavish meals, couldn't get used to such simple food. Homer would even talk while eating. Simon really couldn't stand him anymore. He stopped spitting food on me. Huh? Keep no meal in your mouth, you semi literate spew monkey! That's it, boy. You're going to bed without supper. Lisa realized that Bart was different from usual. Marge and Homer thought this was just a special change during puberty. At this moment, Bart and Milhouse were having a feast in the mansion. Simon's half brother and half sister came to the dining room. The brother heated up a spoon and put it directly into Bart's mouth. You hot spoon! But why? Because you're our half brother. You're blocking our full inheritance, and we hate you! Simon looked out the window. Sadly, Homer was fighting with the dog over a newspaper. But this was a toy newspaper specifically for dogs that Marge had bought. Fantastic! Simon called Bart to complain that Homer was too weird. Bart thought Simon's brother and sister were also strange. They're jealous because my father left their mother to be with my mother. To me. You lost me. Well, gotta go. Enjoy the upper Laura middle class. When Simon was sad, Marge came to find him with pizza that had the crust cut off. Now let me tuck you in. Fluff your pillow. And a little fairy dust to keep the monsters away. It's Cinnamon. Nighty Night, Sweetheart. Simon felt this family was quite nice. But the wealthy family where Bart was staying wasn't so good. The two siblings were going to take Bart to see the family mausoleum. The sister lied to Bart that after 100 years, bodies would turn into candy. After Bart entered the mausoleum, the siblings shut the door. When the wealthy Mister Burns passed by, he heard the cries from inside the door. Only then was Bart rescued. Burns thought Bart was Simon. Your fortune is greater than mine. It is? It is I who am at your service. He had Smithers bring lemonade to serve Bart. But there was only powdered drink mix. Here, premix. I beg your forgiveness, lad. Smithers, pour it down your pants. Now squish about in those pants, rewetting every hour. Come with me. Burns brought Bart to a quiet place. He told Bart about his family. Burns had many siblings, but they all died in various accidents. In the end, only Burns Was left to inherit all the property. He reminded Bart to be careful of his siblings. They might kill Bart at any time. And disguise it as accidents, like cruise ship disasters and skiing accidents. Oh, my God. Simon set me up. All this time, I thought he wanted the life of a stranger he met in the bathroom. Bart realized that his current life was too dangerous, so he wanted to pack his things and leave. And take some of Simon's stuff with him. But the siblings had already come to Bart's side. They were going to force Bart to go skiing in Aspen. Bart thought of Burns's warning ski trip on the other side. Simon was seriously listening to Grandpa tell stories. Lisa noticed something was wrong. Bart would never listen to Grandpa's stories. She pulled Simon aside. Okay, listen, you. I don't know who you are, what you've done with the real Bart, but god help me, I want him back. I don't know what you're talking about. The real Bart would have thrown me out the window. Lisa asked Simon to tell the family the truth. Simon confessed the secret that they had swapped identities. And told Homer about Bart being murdered in Aspen. Thank you, future Bart, for traveling back through time to warn us to save Bart. The whole fam

Martin! Oh, my god! Grab onto this! Come on, wake up! Bart didn't expect that a prank would actually kill someone. He hurriedly rode his bicycle home. Lisa thought Martin might just be injured. But Bart chose to turn on the TV to divert attention. At that moment, the TV station reported Martin's fall off the cliff. And we know exactly who is to blame. No one. The boy clearly fell by accident. The police suspected Martin accidentally fell and was eaten by a mountain lion. Because the mountain lion had Martin's clothes in its mouth. Oh, my god! We're murderers! Lisa only wanted to save Martin, but accidentally became an accomplice. She imagined herself living in prison and was very frightened. I've been in trouble, but never like this. Guess I'll go turn myself in. Lisa stopped Bart because she was afraid of being arrested. She believed Martin's death was an accident. If we turn ourselves in, we still can't bring Martin back to life. At this moment, Marge came over and asked the two children where they had been playing. We were never outside. We were here all day. That quick talking is never a good sign. It's usually true, but in this case, it's not. Marge was somewhat worried about the children's behavior. But now Homer also had strange behavior. He lied that the company had been very busy recently, so he needed to work overtime on Saturday, after Homer left, Marge made a phone call to track Homer. The person tracking Homer was a TV crew that helps catch cheaters. Marge wanted them to investigate Homer's affair. There, there. I'm sorry I'm so emotional. No, I mean cry to the camera. Over there. There. Yeah. Soon, the school Learned of Martin's death. Everyone held a farewell ceremony for Martin. The principal was very sad about his passing, so he made a memorial video for Martin. The video recorded footage of Martin before his death. Bart felt very guilty after watching the video. Nelson noticed something unusual about Bart and Lisa and became suspicious. Martin was afraid of heights. What's he doing on a cliff? It don't add up. After the memorial service, the janitor threw Martin's belongings into the trash. Bart collected Martin's things out of guilt. At this time, Nelson came to the cliff where Martin had fallen. He found a bone tied with a string there. Lisa wore sunglasses whenever she went out because of her guilty conscience. Hey, little murderer! What? Those shades are killing me. They're so cute. Bart ran into her at the supermarket. Lisa told him to pretend not to know her. When she saw a police officer looking at her, she quickly had Bart pretend to twist her arm. However, their strange behavior was noticed by Nelson. Then Nelson took out the bone with a rope attached that he had found on the cliff. He believed this must have Been done by someone who likes to play pranks. Bart quickly said this wasn't done by him. Nelson had something to do at the moment, so he left. The crew followed Homer to a restaurant. Homer liquefied all his food and drank it into his stomach. The private investigators were stunned by this sight. Later, Homer sneakily returned home with a briefcase. The briefcase contained corn chips and meat sauce. When Homer was eating, he heard the door open and immediately put away his briefcase. Oh, hey, kids. Um, what's up? What do you mean, what's up? Why are you checking me out? Yeah, nothing's up. Nothing's down. Except for Martin, who died. Idiot. No! Homer also hurried to explain that there was no food in his briefcase. What's up? Nothing, nothing, nothing. That night, Marge found that Homer was not at home again. At this moment, Homer arrived at a motel. After closing the door, he took off all of the other party's clothes. Homer was very satisfied with the roasted lamb. The crew was stunned when they saw this scene. They had secretly filmed so many cheating scenes, but they had never seen such an explosive scene. I've never said this before, but turn the camera off. At this time, Bart was organizing Martin's belongings. He found that Martin's diary recorded a journal about hatching butterflies. Lisa couldn't sleep in bed either, so she came to Bart's bedroom. She wanted to frame the deceased in the morgue for Martin's death. Why are you being so quiet, Bart? Are you judging me? Please don't judge me. Lisa found Bart's confession letter on the bed. Bart was going to Martin's house to end all this. She quickly rode her bike to Martin's house. Lisa saw Bart about to hang himself. Bart, no! Don't do whatever the heck you're doing! But Bart just wanted to take care of Martin's butterflies for him. He wanted to complete Martin's butterfly.

I charge $900 an hour, you asshole. And you're real close to learning why. Why didn't you report the theft at the King Air? I did report it. This is a copy of a report filed with the F A A. Note the date. Yes, we have this. Why did you not report it to local authorities? Because local authorities have no jurisdiction. It's the responsibility of the F A A. To report any theft to local law enforcement. If, in fact, it was a theft. I don't own or manage the plane. I don't control the manifest. Objection. Speculation. If you didn't want an answer, you shouldn't have asked the question. Number one. Number two. This is a deposition. Who is your objection directed toward? Directed toward your client. Which is to say, it's directed toward me. In that case, objection is overruled. Isn't it fun being at a law school? Maybe you should go back, since you clearly do not understand how a deposition works. He is testifying under oath to questions you ask. The only person who can object is me. I can tell him not to answer. You can advise. And his failure to answer questions will be addressed in court. Which it should be. Instead of wasting our fucking time in deposition. Can we pause recording? Can counsel speak? Let's step into the conference room. Have a seat. I'm fine. Listen, hon, we were playing the pissed off Litigator, while you were still being bathed by your daddy. My father died before I was born. Defending your right to say offensive and sexist remarks like the ones you just uttered here in front of six witnesses, all of whom are attorneys and three of whom are women. So if this is how you talk to a woman in front of a court reporter, I wonder what interesting tales they have to tell about those late night discovery sessions. Let's just take the temperature down a notch. Take the temperature down? We are not the ones who are seeking deposition. Let me point the facts of this case out to you. Alright? Your driver used a private road owned and constructed by my client without permission. We had permission. I've seen no such documents submitted by the council. Was verbal permission. From who? Tommy Norris. Would you ask Mister Norris to come in here, please? Listen, let's. I'm done speaking to you. May I speak? Feel free. I know where you're going with this. And you need to understand a verbal agreement is legally binding in the state of Texas if it can be proven. Did you give permission for T T P. To use our cut off to Highway 2 85 when 3 o two was closed for night construction? They asked if they could use a bypass and I allowed them to. Did they ask for that courtesy to be extended beyond the closure of the highway? They did not. Were you or any MTX employees aware of their continued use of the road? I wasn't, and I can't speak for anybody else. You had restricted permission, which had expired. You made no request to extend it. The plane in question was reported stolen and was in possession of the thieves at the time of the accident. But even if it hadn't been stolen, we could land it in the middle of the road whenever we want. It's our fucking road. You had no right, easement, lease, nor permission to use the road. To assert otherwise is false, and the mere insinuation we were complicit in the theft of the plane is defamatory and will be treated as such. Not to mention multiple attempts on record of your partner making a derogatory statement about my gender and stating that I bathed with my father. Falsely insinuating an incestuous and criminally sexual relationship with a deceased Army Ranger uncle. We get it. Do you think they hired me cause I'm pretty? I charge $900 an hour, you asshole, and you're real close to learning why. So here's what you're going to do. You're gonna drop this bullshit claim, or I will sue this firm, your client, and your insurance company for defamation, slander, frivolous and malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of emotional distress, anything else I can come up with. And when this is over, in seven years, you will be disbarred and I will hang your law degrees. Over my fucking toilet! Ha ha!

Why did you buy it? I walked in that sad little room back, the one nobody seemed to care about. And everywhere I looked there was colour and life. Something in the front room was a little short of.

This is the painting. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. But I don't understand why would you keep it locked away in here? I mean, why don't you sell it? Sell it, sell it.

So he sold me to a witch. That day, a woman who came to buy pigs stared at my filthy face and casually asked my father, how much for this animal? 6 4. What are you doing? Sold! Four marks! Have you gone mad? You can't let them have her! As I said, sold full marks! Terrified, I begged my mother to save me. But my father pinned me down so hard, I couldn't even struggle. Just like that, I was treated as cargo and sold to a stranger, a woman who turned out to be the witch Tisaya. She brought me to aretusa, a place they called a sanctuary of magic. That night, I saw myself in the mirror for the first time. Ugly, twisted, almost not human. Shame and despair rose inside me. I smashed the mirror with my fist, picked up a sharp shard with trembling hands, and tried to end a life that felt meaningless. But I couldn't even die. The next day, I woke up in ouratous grand hall with to Sayah standing beside me. Shaking with hatred, I gritted my teeth and asked her, do I not even have the right to die? Oh, that's adorable, piglet. You weren't taking control. You were losing it. In the end, Tosiya said she wanted to teach me magic. Magic? To someone who didn't even think life was worth Living it sounded like a joke, but I was still taken to the training hall, where many girls like me, all bought, were gathered to. Siah told us that chaos energy is everywhere the most dangerous and powerful form of magic, and each one of us had accidentally triggered it before, which was why we were chosen and brought here. Once we mastered it, we would be sent to various kingdoms to assist kings and influence the fate of the entire continent. It sounded glorious, but the truth was, from the moment we stepped in, we had already lost our freedom. Tosaia said all magic depended on balance and control, so she began testing whether we were worthy of advancing. She ordered us to lift the stones on the ground without touching them, using only a spell. One girl succeeded. The moment the stone rose, I trembled with envy. But the next second, her left hand shriveled, drained of flesh and blood, leaving only a twisted bone. Her screams echoed through the hall. Tosaia only nodded and said, this is balance. Then she demonstrated she held a flower, spoke the incantation, and the stone floated while the flower instantly withered. She told us, magic is never free. The other girls quickly followed and succeeded one by one. As for me, I failed again and again. The more I tried, the more panicked I became, the more panicked, more hopeless. In desperation, I shoved the flower into my mouth and chewed. It attempting the most primitive form of exchange. Tosaia stared at me in shock, as if seeing me for the first time. She walked up to me and said something meaningful. Sometimes a flower is just a flower.

That's a touchdown bonus. You pay me per touchdown. I also pay you to win. Did you even read your contract? Teach him to read, man. Looking at the hundred dollar Bill in my hand, I was a bit stunned. Just before taking the field, I rushed to confirm with him whether I'd get a bonus for both passing and touchdowns. The coach gave me a definite yes, which made me really happy because I could use that money to support my family. Before graduating from college, I'd spent four years riding the bench. Even when the starting players made serious mistakes, the coach still wouldn't give me a chance. Not long after graduation, a coach I'd never met took notice of my passing. He wanted me to join his team to play in the Arena Football League. I had no reason to turn down an opportunity like that. So there I was, standing on that field, driving the fans wild with one precise touchdown pass after another. Oh, my word. Later, a scout I didn't know came looking for me. He invited me to their tryout. I looked at my coach questioningly, but he just gave me a knowing look. I'm sorry, who are you? I'm with the Rams. And just like that, I attended the NFL Rams tryout and successfully made the team as their backup quarterback. But it wasn't long before, during a game, the team starting quarterback got injured. Me, the rookie who Just joined. Had no choice but to step into his position. The Rams are in business. The moment I stepped onto the field, I was blown away by everything in front of me. My heart was racing with both excitement and nerves. The game started. Before I could even get a pass off, I got intercepted. The other team cheered loudly, but I didn't lose heart. On the next snap, I moved quickly looking for a passing opportunity. I threw the ball to a teammate who run into the opponent's end zone. Everyone went wild, and the other team was starting to panic. Next drive, I threw a low pass to my teammate just as he was about to score. They stopped him, but it was enough. In the final moments of the game, I found my opportunity and threw the ball again. Perfect. Great catch! Touchdown! Wow!

At the moment when the eldest sister was frozen into ice, the elephant kicked the man to the ground. Meanwhile, another monster had set its sights on the child in the stands. It leaped toward the stands, but just as it stretched out its palm, it was bitten by Charlotte's huge mouth. Then the twins took off their masks, and with a scream, the monster was instantly petrified and shattered into powder. The monsters were defeated, but the Elsa was frozen into ice and motionless. Tom sadly said goodbye to her, but at that moment she opened her eyes.

Stop. This is, can wait a couple years. Mom, you said this was my decision. You said after my bar mitzvah, I'd be a man and I could decide. That is because we thought by 13 you'd make the mature decision. Can't just cut off the parts of your body that you don't like, all right? I, I, I don't like my thighs, okay, or my, my saggy arms or my chin. But if we all cut off the parts we don't like, we'd all have nothing left. Wow. Seth, your father has the exact same chest as you and nobody thinks he's a woman. They call me booby at school, man boobs, double d. Some kid keeps hanging a bra in my locker. I'm starting high school in a year. It's gonna be all new people. I just wanna start over. I wanna be normal like everyone else. 13 is young for plastic surgery, but your kid's not gonna grow out of it. He's already gone through puberty and his father's had the same condition his entire life. Look, if you had weight to lose, I would advise diet and exercise. But your kid doesn't have a weight problem. He has breasts. He needs excision of the glandular tissue. And yeah, it could wait till he's older. But he's a dude with breasts and he's headed for high school. And there's no reason you should be subjected to the psychological damage that comes from years of taking Schoolyard crap. Look, you want your kid to be a man? Let him make his own decisions. Well, there's some swelling, but that should go down with some time. I don't have boobs. You don't have boobs, mom. She was scared. Now she's just happy you're okay. You're the man. No, you're the man.

I poured water across the floor, hung sharp icicles from the eaves, spilled gasoline across the ground by the door. Finally, I smashed my father's treasured Lego set on the floor, then stomped on it twice. Everything was set. All I needed was for those two thieves to show up that night. They did come, but the road wet with water, frozen solid, their car slammed straight into a streetlight. After quickly treating their wounds, they stepped up to the front door. The thieves decided to split up. One pride opened the front door, ready to shut off the shrieking alarm. Santa, is that you? How are you, little boy? Orange stripe sent a party. No. I seized the moment and strapped VR goggles over his head. The dazed thief opened his eyes. That's too high. Not too high. Terrified, his legs nearly buckled. Okay, you just gotta make it across. Just one small jump. He tensed his entire body. One, two, 3, 2, 1. Meanwhile, the woman was sneaking toward the back door, but I had already set up soda cans. Each was stuffed with mint candies as propellant. The soda erupted like guided rockets. Stop. Ah. Only when she fled to the basement did she narrowly escape. Before she could catch her breath, I ignited the detonator. Her feet burst into flames. She rushed toward the faucet, but I've already tampered with the faucet. Though the flames on her souls were extinguished, her entire body froze stiff as she tried to push open the door. Something blocked her path. After several violent shoves, she realized it was her partner. When they spotted me, they lunged forward, seeing me flee once more. The two pursued relentlessly. The man had just turned around. Woman caught up. She opened the bedroom door. Catch. Oh, no, you hit me with the incredibly soft yoga ball. But the man finally cornered me. With no escape left, I leaped over the second floor railing. See ya.

Is the baby okay? Yes. Uh, the surgery went well. Uh, her vitals are good. She'll likely need to stay in, uh, NICU for a while, but she's looking good. Has Emily seen her? She's still in surgery. Wait, she's still in surgery? We're doing everything that we can. I, I have to go back. Everything you can. How serious is this? I lost a lot of blood. Where's Dr Herman? Dr Herman had a plan. Now you've got my baby in critical care. My wife is bleeding to death. I don't even know who you are. How's this baby? Is there any change? No, she's good. She's stable. Let me do it. How? How, Alex, how do I tell him that his wife is dead? Where the hell is Herman? She should have been here. It's not helping. I was here. Emily was my responsibility, and I lost her. So let me do it. Placenta previa is very difficult to diagnose. And in cases as severe as Emily's, it's usually insurmountable. If your baby had come to term, it's likely Emily would have died. No. If I'd done the surgery we planned, it's likely that down the line we would have lost Emily and your daughter, Dr Robbins did everything within her power for your wife, but she saved your baby's life. Your baby is alive because of her.

I know I'm just supposed to be here to remove a few ribs, but I'm wondering if you've ever tried anything more radical to treat the spinal curvature? Having a steel rod inserted into my spine, then. Yeah, we tried. I brought just the bent. But it will really improve your quality of life. Really? So this surgery is gonna get me laid? Heather, stop, mom. And I don't think doctors should make promises they can't keep, but there's a girl here. She's 17 years old with severe scoliosis from beta syndrome. She's here for thoracoplasty because her ribs are pressing against her lungs, and she's already had two spinal fusions and a segmental spinal instrumentation that didn't work. She's bent over at 90 degrees, which clearly sucks. Clearly sucks? Is that your professional assessment? My professional assessment is that we can help her.

I mean I think I can get you standing up straight. It's not nice to mock crippled kids. You see this. This curved part here? I'd remove it. You want to remove a portion of my daughter's spine?

She's still in surgery. Wait, she's still in surgery? We're doing everything that we can. I, I have to go back. Everything you can? How serious is this? I lost a lot of blood. Where's Dr. Herman? Dr. Herman had a plan. Now you've got my baby in critical care. My wife is bleeding to death. I don't even know who you are. How's this baby? Is there any change? No, she's good. She's stable. Let me do it. How? How, Alex? How do I tell him that his wife is dead? Where the hell is Herman? She should have been here. It's not helping. I was here. Emily was my responsibility, and I lost her. So let me do it. Placenta accreta is very difficult to diagnose, and in cases as severe as Emily's, it's usually insurmountable. If your baby had come to term, it's likely Emily would have died. No. If I'd done the surgery we planned, it's likely that down the line, we would have lost Emily and your daughter. Dr. Robbins, Did everything within her power for your wife.

En la transacción descubrí algo aterrador. La velocidad con la que ella apretaba el gatillo era 5 segundos más rápida que mi reacción entrenada. Pero lo que más me preocupaba, incluso si movía intencionadamente el punto de mira, ella seguía acertando al objetivo, lo mismo a 1000m. Al oír el disparo me puse en guardia de inmediato. Ella no era una cliente común, muy probablemente era una asesina a sueldo enviada por la organización para matarme. Empecé a trazar un plan qué hacer a continuación, ella me pasó el arma. Cuando me pidió revisar el silenciador, sugerí hacer un disparo de prueba al lado. En ese momento dudé. Podría haber acabado con todo con solo apretar el gatillo, pero decidí no arriesgarme. Tenía que trazar un plan perfecto e inventé una excusa. Dije que había que ajustar detalles. Las balas no estaban listas todavía. Ya no sospecho nada. Incluso me dio 4 días para prepararme de regreso. Rompí el coche a propósito y lo llevé a reparar. Aprovechando que el mecánico se dio la vuelta, robé en silencio unas piezas de metal y me las llevé a casa. Pasé varias noches trabajando en secreto con esas piezas. Las monté en algo que parecía piezas normales de arma. Todo por dentro había sido modificado por mí. Hice algo muy peligroso, por si acaso. 4 días después volvimos a vernos. Le entregué la munición. Ella no dijo ni una palabra. Pidió probar el arma. El restaurante estaba Vacío, solo nosotros 2, la atmósfera era tensa. Mi instinto me dijo que era una trampa. Metí el arma en el bolsillo, me acerqué despacio, listo para reaccionar ante cualquier imprevisto. La transacción pareció ir bien sobre el dinero, pensé que había sido paranoico, pero poco después de que ella se fue, recibí una llamada de mi superior.

Usó el pedazo de espejo para observar. Vio a unos ladrones reteniendo a una chica. Las voces se acercaban. De repente, salió corriendo. Agarró a un ladrón y lo estrelló contra la pared. Tras dejarlo inconsciente, golpeó a otro ladrón. El ruido atrajo a sus compañeros. Pronto. Ben quedó rodeado. Superado en número, sacó gas pimienta. Al instante, todos los ladrones quedaron sin fuerzas. Aprovechó y escapó con la chica.

Se fue enseguida, pero una mesera se escondió en su auto. Le rogó a Ben que la llevara a Estados Unidos. Quería escapar de la mafia. Ben no conocía bien el lugar, así que la llevó a la policía local. Pensó que todo había terminado Pero de regreso fue rodeado por mafiosos armados. El jefe le advirtió que no se metiera. No tuvo más opción que aceptar, pero al día siguiente la mesera volvió a buscarlo. Al ver a la chica herida no pudo rechazarla. Ambos entraron en una casa rodante para hablar. En ese momento llegó la banda. Ben salió con una pistola para enfrentarlos, pero un mafioso lo atacó por sorpresa. Se enfrascaron en una pelea. Al final, Ben apuntó con el arma al mafioso. El hombre suplicaba por su vida. De pronto se oyó un disparo detrás de él. Era la chica quien había disparado

Al darse cuenta de lo que había visto, rápidamente se dio la vuelta y se dirigió directamente a casa de su mejor amiga. Al notar su inquietud, su amiga le preguntó apresuradamente qué le pasaba. Al oír esto, su amiga se echó a reír incontrolablemente y le explicó que simplemente estaba pasando por un estirón. Pero la mujer pensaba que era demasiado grande, totalmente diferente a lo que debería tener un ser humano normal. Temía que su hijo se quedara solo para el resto de su vida. Al oír esto, su amiga sintió curiosidad y decidió hacerle una adivinación al chico. Luego le pidió que sacara tres cartas al azar, mientras su propia mano se deslizaba bajo la mesa. Al instante, el chico sintió un cosquilleo. Se quedó paralizado en el acto, pero esta oleada de debilidad le resultó extrañamente agradable. Solo entonces se dio cuenta de que su amiga no había mentido. En ese momento entró la madre del niño y se retiró rápidamente. La mano había venido a preguntar por la adivinación. La adivina respondió con calma, tu hijo nunca tendrá que preocuparse por tener hijos. Luego le dedicó al niño una sonrisa peculiar. Él le devolvió la sonrisa inmediatamente.

Thank you, sir. Someone said you'll never make detective. I happily stand corrected. Congratulations, Officer Nolan. You passed 98%. Really? Which one did I miss? That's, you know what, never mind. That's, I'm sorry. Thank you. This is a relief to have this behind me. Send your records forever. But certainly this Mark has to help my case in becoming a detective. Your letter of reprimand has been CC to every lieutenant and captain in the department. Trust me, they have long memories. So for you to even be considered for detective, every one of them would have to retire and most of those guys are younger than you. I've beat the odds before. You're a good cop with a long fish career ahead of you, but detective is no longer in your path. You need to make peace with her. Yes, sir. Chief Coleman has some good news. Chief. Thank you, sergeant. I'm sure you're all aware of Officer Nolan's Rolex stand down at the border which landed a dozen dangerous felons in custody. In light of your courageous and exemplary service, I've decided to offer you any assignment in the LAPD, any unit, any division, any position you want the department to train you for is yours. It's what we unofficially call the golden ticket. Thank you, miss. It's a big decision. Don't rush it. I won't. Gee, what I miss. Smell that gold ticket. Wow. Don't waste your ticket by becoming a detective. Nolan, you know how hard they have to work go with recruiting you get paid to fly around the country and talk up the LAPD boring. You go with air support city will pay for flight school and you'll always have a backup career. Do I need a backup career? K9 is the way to go overtime is 200 an hour and you get to keep the dog if all you want is money, the department will pay you to learn computer forensics or I could use the ticket to get back on track for becoming a training officer this year. Haha, that's funny. Haha. No kidding. No, I mean, yeah, I I certainly have some thinking to do. Yeah, he's gonna pick something lame. Oh, for sure. Have you decided what you're gonna do with your golden ticket? Yes, I have. Whoop whoop. Very funny. But no detective also no training officer. I knew it and I admire it. Of course. Everyone else is gonna give you endless grief. Of course, but I know you're doing it to get back and that's noble as hell. If I wanna be part of the change, I need to put my money where my mouth is literally. Do you you know how much forensic text can make? Yes, I I'll schedule your toe exam as soon as possible. Well, maybe give me a couple days to study up. I've been a little busy. We'll do.

Alright, maybe that could help. You know, my head is spinning around right now. Exactly. And if you're anything like me, you gotta be wondering why would he leave this car to me? Yeah, I mean, you know, we did work on it every day after school, you know, you would save up money and try and get all the parts, slowly build it up. I mean, It took four years to build the whole car and then to get it to look like this. I wish you had those moments. It's more than I got. I think maybe he was a little over the top and overcompensated with me because of how he bolted out on you. I grew up thinking I did something wrong. If you loved me, you wouldn't have left, right? Late at night listening to my mom cry herself to sleep coming up with crazy plans. I was gonna track him down and I guess winning back. But now I'm thinking I dodged a bullet. You dodged a huge bullet. Still love him though. Is that weird? No, it's not weird. It's human. I don't know if it's with dad intent by leaving me the car. He actually put me in the loop. So at home, be in touch. Be, yeah, just come, come visit. You can make sure she's running, right deal.

Intentó despertarla y lo extraño era que no había ni rastro de otras personas. Como había llegado esa mujer allí, el anciano rápidamente apagó su rastreador y la chica no reaccionó en absoluto. Entonces el anciano le dio la vuelta al cuerpo y movió los dedos frente a sus ojos. Afortunadamente, Ana pudo ver y pudo responder parpadeando al anciano. Al enterarse de que Ana podía escuchar pero no moverse, el anciano se dio cuenta de que estaba herida. Decidió cargarla y llevarla a su casa y luego llamar al 911. Al al ver al anciano alejarse, vio un avión sobrevolando su cabeza y de inmediato se puso ansiosa. Afortunadamente, el anciano la empujó de regreso a casa en una carretilla, pero ella no sabía que eso le costaría la vida al anciano. En ese momento, alguien golpeó la puerta y Ana parpadeó incontrolablemente y el anciano percibió la extrañeza de inmediato. Al abrir la puerta, se apareció un hombre que dijo estar buscando a su esposa desaparecida. Al escuchar la descripción de Jack, el anciano se dio cuenta de que él era la persona que buscaba a Ana. Pero cuando el anciano regresó a la habitación para comprobar, Jack irrumpió de repente. Parecía estar buscando algo intencionalmente. El anciano se enfureció al ver que Jack era tan grosero. En ese momento, Jack dijo que había perdido su teléfono. Le pidió ayuda al anciano y con lágrimas en los ojos El anciano le creyó de inmediato. Tan pronto como el anciano se sentó en la silla, Jack dijo que Ana tenía problemas mentales y no quería que su familia se enterara, por lo que no deseaba la intervención de la policía. Jack no sabía que Ana estaba escondida debajo del sofá y despreciaba profundamente sus palabras. Si no fuera por Jack, ella tampoco estaría inmóvil. Afortunadamente, el anciano no expuso a Ana, pero Jack rápidamente comenzó a sospechar que Ana estaba con el anciano. Justo cuando Jack fingía engañar al anciano, su teléfono sonó de repente. Esto hizo que el anciano descubriera instantáneamente la mentira de Jack, porque Jack había dicho que su teléfono se había perdido en un accidente. Al ver esto, Jack reveló su verdadera intención. El anciano se dio cuenta de que Jack no era una buena persona y lo empujó al suelo. Pero justo cuando el anciano estaba a punto de llamar a la policía, Jack se lanzó sorpresivamente hacia él.

Her father deliberately made noise to draw the monster's attention. Seizing the chance, she scrambled to her feet and fled. The creature suddenly grew agitated, turning to chase after her. Fortunately, at the last moment, Ridley managed to lock the wooden door. An adult unicorn let out a cry directed at her. She slowly raised her head. The unicorn regained its composure and thrust its horn through the wooden door. She slowly raised her hand. Her consciousness seemed to merge with the unicorns and countless images flooded into her mind. A gunshot shattered this strange connection. The unicorn turned and charged at the others. Her father hid in the warehouse, slamming the door shut, but it couldn't stop the beast's advance. They kept running, only to find another unicorn blocking their path. They slammed the door and hid inside the house. Two adult unicorns searched the yard for their young. Their child lay inside the villa. Researchers ground powder from the young unicorn's horn, mixed it into a potion and injected it into the tycoon's IV bag. The tycoon, who had been near death, rejuvenated. His cancer and tumors completely cured. He ordered the researchers to cut off its horn. She felt the same pain. Through their connection, the researchers placed the horn into a sealed jar. Ignoring others attempts to stop her, she dragged out the young unicorn's body, intending to return It to its parents. Suddenly, the building lost power. The wealthy man's son step forward to block her, refusing to let her ruin this opportunity for fortune. Wait, I'm sorry, what are you saying? Her father took her hand, determined to resign his position and take his daughter away. But the unicorn had already smashed through the front door. Everyone scattered in panic. He took his daughter to hide in a warehouse. He pulled out the stolen horn and apologized to his daughter, saying he should have listened to her sooner, forgave him and he pushed her out the door and locked it from the outside. Dad, no, please, please, you can't do this. I love you. He took the horn to return it to the unicorn, buying his daughter time to escape. She fled the villa, plunged into the bushes and was saved. She turned back and saw the unicorn emerging from the villa's front door. She held her breath and closed her eyes. When she opened them again, she saw two unicorns placing her father and the baby unicorn together. As their horns touched, a flash of lightning erupted. Both the baby unicorn and her father were revived. The family of three unicorns returned to the forest and she embraced her father.

Aku! She narrowly escaped death and turned to look. Her comrade was locked in combat with the monster. The missile bay door swung open. She rushed forward to help. Her comrade dragged the monster out of the plane, both plunging to their deaths. She was a split second too late, but the monster grabbed the edge of the aircraft and escaped. She grabbed a weapon nearby and began pounding relentlessly at the monster's tail. Its tail was severed and fell away. Her eyes widened in shock. It spread its wings and took flight. Fuck! She hurled a box of ammunition at it, but after several attempts, it dodged every strike. Seeing the monster about to escape, she breathed a sigh of relief. But when she turned, the creature had slipped back in through the rear of the plane. She raised her pistol and fired, successfully drawing the monster's attention. Her comrade seized the moment to draw his gun for a sneak attack, nearly hitting her in the process. The creature climbed onto the cabin roof. She aimed again and successfully hit it. She got up to check, confirming she'd finally shaken off the monster's pursuit. But when she turned, enemy fighters were closing in, bullets torn to the cabin and the plane was about to crash. She rushed to the heavy machine gun and unleashed all her fury. As she emptied the magazine, the enemy aircraft was shot. Down she turned toward the cockpit and asked the co pilot to assist with the emergency landing. She found a shallow stretch of land and forced the plane down with a jolt. They made it, but looking back, she saw flames erupting beneath the fuel tank. Several comrades helped each other out and escaped safely. They scrambled to their feet and continued towards safety. The wounded were settled by the Riverbank. Suddenly the monster appeared and snatched the box. Just as the monster turned its head, she seized the box back and handed it to her comrade. Then facing the fallen monster, she tore off her sleeve and advanced toward it. The creature, terrified, turned and fled in disarray. She accelerated toward it, grabbed its tail and kicked it to the ground. Mounting the creature, she rained punches down upon it. For a moment, her comrades couldn't tell who looked more like the monster. Returning triumphant after defeating the creature, she earned nothing but admiration from her comrades.

This is no sinus infection. It never was. Take this down to the lab quickly. I got it. Stop right there. Dr Manny. Lucas, you scoped him. We told her not to. Dr Manny, I'm sorry, but you need to come with us. Hold on. What is the charges? Unlawful restraint as well as medical assault and battery. Please. Mr and Mrs. Harper, Lucas has clots and inflammation in His lungs and airways. This is not a sinus infection. It is far more serious. We want our son discharged now. Let's go. Dr Manning. No, please. If you want to help your son, okay, just wait for the labs to come back. Do not take him out of the hospital, please. I'll page Peter Kelly and have him meet her at the station. Absolutely not. Excuse me. The hospital is not gonna protect her. She got herself into this mess. She can get herself out of it.

Well, we didn't see that happen. You don't believe me? We don't believe you. No, I'm sorry. Am I missing something? He's always had a history of alcohol issues we think that's why are you serious right now? I fell and hurt myself but you think I've been drinking? Can smell it on you Zoe. How dumb do you think we are? Pretty dumb actually because I haven't had one sip of alcohol in months. Calm down. How embarrassing this is you alright Zoe? Yeah. Okay. Uh, CBC CNP blood and urine talks and blood alcohol plus a chest x ray and CT abdomen and pelvis to see about that fall alright, I should give us a clear idea of what's going on here. Yeah, your CT scans are negative. I'm not seeing any injuries from a fall but your blood alcohol content is very high at point two four o grams per deciliter. You're drunk. We knew it. I'm not. It's a mistake. We've got to get you into some kind of program. Can can you help us with that? Of course I didn't drink anything. Alright, stop lying Zoe. Okay, that's enough. Not lying. Just stop. It's insulting. You're slurring your words. It's insulting. You're slurring your work. Uh, get a line hang a leader saline. You got it? We're gonna hydrate Zoe. Okay, she should sober up Pretty soon. Doctor Scott, they need you. What's happening? She's having a seizure. You push 5. Benadryl. Meds are in. Thank you. Come on, sweetie. Breathe. Breathe. What happened? She's gotten worse since we've been here. Is this related to the alcohol? But what's going on? We are gonna get to the bottom of this. Blood alcohol content is now up to point three, one o. But wouldn't alcohol poisoning explain her seizure? For sure. But her numbers are still climbing while she sits there on a sailing drink. I mean, how is that even possible? Must be drinking. We checked all the stuff for booze. Her parents are watching over her like a hawk. She couldn't have possibly snuck a drink. She swore up and down that she didn't drink anything. What if she wasn't lying? But how? Take another look at her CT scans, the one from this morning. Got your labs back, Zoe. Seems your blood alcohol content keeps rising. That doesn't make any sense. It's tripping me up too, because Zoe said she hadn't had anything to drink. Nope, not a drop. Still though, I gotta try to make sense of these numbers. You know, I do keep thinking back on this fad from a couple years ago. Bunch of kids used to take tampons and soak them in alcohol before using them and then absorb the alcohol through the bloodstream. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Reason I ask is, uh, you were On this road trip today, stuck in a car with your parents, conditions were there if you were desperate to get your buzz on. No way. Yeah, you are wearing a tampon. Showed up in your CT scans. Whatever you're doing, Zoe, I get the distinct feeling that you know it's wrong. Zoe, honey, you're making yourself sick. Zoe, why don't you come with me to the bathroom? Okay.

Even the gas he exhaled while sleeping had to remain square. The wheels of his tractor and the potatoes he harvested, everything there was perfectly square. Then one day, a round alien landed on his farm. The alien wanted to be friends, even offering him food from its own planet. But the man despised anything circular. Fuming, he slammed the door in the alien's face. Yet the alien was annoyingly persistent. When the man tried to sleep, it hovered nearby making noise. When he went to the bathroom, the alien popped up right inside the toilet. That was the last straw. The man snapped and with one swift move, he flattened the alien into a perfect square. Later, while tending his fields, the man spotted a tiny square shaped flower sprouting in the wheat. Overjoyed, he took it home under his care. The little flower grew tall and strong. But when the alien saw that square flower, it tried to pull it out by the roots. The man couldn't stand it anymore. He kicked the alien out in a fit of rage. That night, the square flower transformed into a massive square monster. The man rushed to the door to escape, but the creature chased him down, opened its enormous mouth and swallowed him whole. Inside the monster's stomach, the acid began to burn. The man was losing consciousness. At the last moment, the alien dove in to save Him pushing him out of the monster's body, only to be thrown violently aside. The man picked up the explosive device and aimed it at the monster. Yet torn by his obsession with squares, he hesitated, remembering how the alien had tried to stop him from planting the flower. The man understood everything. He broke free from his rigid square principles and willingly became good friends with the alien.

En lugar de eso, se queda ansioso en el vestíbulo mirando la pantalla del televisor. Hasta que un día el presentador del canal deportivo se quedó dormido. De repente, la imagen cambió. Los jugadores también cayeron al suelo. El hombre vio esta escena y no pudo evitarlo. Corrió rápidamente hacia el guardia de seguridad. Le dio un golpe derribándolo. Aprovechó la ocasión para quitarle el arma. Luego corrió hacia la multitud como un loco. Los pasajeros comenzaron a gritar aterrados. Sin embargo, el hombre no lastimó a nadie. Solo corría desesperadamente hacia la pista de aterrizaje. En ese momento, la azafata notó algo extraño fuera. Corrió a cerrar la puerta del avión, pero no pudo evitar que el hombre entrara. Jack, con el arma en mano, ordenó a la azafata que cerrara la puerta. Los pasajeros en el avión empezaron a entrar en pánico. Luego jack corrió rápidamente hacia la cabina de pilotaje. Amenazó al piloto con el arma para que despegara inmediatamente y le explicó, debemos salir de aquí antes de que salga el sol. De lo contrario, todos moriremos. El piloto, confundido, intentó quitarle el arma, pero no solo falló, sino que también se disparó a la palma de la mano. Ahora no podía operar el avión por sí solo y el copiloto también había desaparecido. Jack solo pudo preguntar si había alguien en la cabina que supiera pilotar el avión. Una Mujer llamada kelly levantó la mano. Dijo que podía volar un helicóptero. Jack la llevó rápidamente a la cabina de pilotaje. A medida que el avión despegaba lentamente, jack ordenó al piloto volar hacia el oeste porque esa era la dirección donde el sol se ponía. Una vez que el avión voló con estabilidad, el piloto finalmente preguntó, el amanecer significa la muerte. ¿Qué significa eso? Jack empezó a explicar. Soy teniente coronel del ejército de la otan. Escuché accidentalmente una reunión secreta de alto nivel. Descubrí que el sol ha mutado. Todos los seres vivos expuestos a la luz del sol morirán. Incluso dentro de los edificios no se puede escapar. En ese momento, aún tenía dudas, pero lo que vi en la televisión, los atletas cayendo al suelo confirmó todo. Por eso debemos competir contra el sol. Solo si permanecemos en la oscuridad tenemos alguna esperanza de sobrevivir. El piloto, aunque difícil de creer, aceptó seguir las instrucciones de jack. Sin embargo, puso una condición, le pidió a jack que mantuviera en secreto lo relacionado con el sol para evitar causar pánico entre los pasajeros. Después de pensarlo, jack estuvo de acuerdo. Luego, el piloto anunció por megafonía que el destino del avión había cambiado de moscú a islandia. Los pasajeros no entendieron. Jack prometió que no revelaría la razón. Sin embargo, uno de los pasajeros, martin, oyó accidentalmente la conversación entre jack y el piloto. Le preguntó a jack qué pasaba con el sol. Jack, impaciente, respondió, Estás equivocado. Como todos temían al teniente coronel armado, los pasajeros se callaron. En ese momento, un pasajero comenzó a vomitar sin cesar. Martin aprovechó para tomar el arma y, apuntando con ella, ordenó a la azafata que encerrara a jack en el baño. Sin embargo, cuando la azafata cerró la puerta con llave, martin apuntó con el arma. Al piloto. Lo presionó para saber por qué ocultaban la verdad sobre el sol y su capacidad de matar. El sol claramente está matando a todos, explicó el piloto. Jack es solo un loco mental. Yo solo lo estaba siguiendo porque tenía miedo de su arma. Después de escuchar esto, martin bajó la guardia. Sin la amenaza de jack. El piloto pudo operar el avión con más calma, pero pronto la escena en el aeropuerto de islandia hizo que su corazón se acelerara nuevamente en el suelo. La gente luchaba entre sí por el control de los aviones. El lugar estaba lleno de gritos. Era un infierno en la tierra

La mujer, encogida en un rincón, apretaba con fuerza la piedra, que, según decían, tenía el poder de ahuyentar el mal, rezando para poder aguantar hasta el amanecer. Cada vez que caía la noche, esos monstruos devoradores de vísceras aparecían en las calles del pueblo y no se marchaban hasta que salía el primer rayo de sol. Por eso el sheriff jack hacía sonar la campana al atardecer para alertar a los vecinos. En cuanto se escuchaba el repique, todos cerraban puertas y ventanas, tocando de paso el amuleto colgado en la entrada. Hasta los niños más pequeños sabían que eso significaba, ni se te ocurra salir solo cuando no quedaba nadie en la calle. Jack regresaba tranquilo a la comisaría. En la pared, un contador marcaba que ya habían sobrevivido 96 noches sin víctimas. Lo que jack no imaginaba era que esa racha estaba a punto de romperse. Aquel día un hombre había bebido tanto en la taberna que el dueño se vio obligado a dejarlo dormir allí. El problema era que su esposa y sus hijos seguían en casa esa noche, al ver que su marido no regresaba, la mujer cerró con llave y se fue a dormir de madrugada. Su hija estaba por acostarse cuando escuchó la voz de su abuela fuera de la ventana. Al correr la cortina, vio a la abuela pidiendo entrar porque tenía frío. La Niña la creyó y cuando la madre llegó a detenerla ya era tarde. A la mañana siguiente, el hombre despertó con resaca y se encontró a los vecinos reunidos frente a su casa. Antes de poder preguntar qué había pasado, jack le soltó una bofetada. Ya le había advertido que las familias con niños debían sellar las ventanas porque los pequeños eran los más fáciles de engañar, pero él se confió y ahora su mujer y su hija estaban muertas. La furia de jack tenía otra razón de fondo, cada vez que alguien moría, extraños aparecían misteriosamente en el pueblo y con cada recién llegado, todo el sistema de protección se desestabilizaba. El día del funeral, un auto caravana llegó al pueblo. Jack ordenó silencio y se adelantó para hablar con los ocupantes. Al saber que solo se habían perdido, les indicó una dirección para que salieran de allí, pero por más que condujeron no lograron salir del pueblo. Jack ya lo presentía y prefirió no explicar nada. Lo único que esperaba era que esa familia aceptara pronto la situación, porque solo venciendo el miedo podrían sobrevivir. Sin embargo, no tardaron en sufrir un accidente. En el bosque, la caravana volcó entre los árboles, la madre quedó inconsciente, el padre atrapado, la hija con heridas leves y el hijo menor con una rama atravesándole el muslo. Jack organizó un equipo de rescate, pero curar al niño llevaría al -1 hora y solo quedaban 40 minutos antes del anochecer, sin otra Opción, jack decidió quedarse a pasar la noche con ellos. Colgó los amuletos, selló cada rendija. Cuando el hombre le preguntó qué era todo eso, él no respondió de inmediato, simplemente se dedicó a prepararse en silencio. De pronto se escucharon gruñidos entre los árboles. El sheriff miró por la ventana y vio cómo las criaturas se acercaban. ¡Ya estaban aquí!

Cuando estaba a punto de tocar el suelo, desplegó sus alas y se elevó con fuerza, surcando el cielo con una gracia indescriptible. Ella era una de las hadas oscuras, la misma especie que Maléfica. Poco después, un hombre de apariencia similar a ella la llevó ante un majestuoso fénix que acababa de renacer de sus cenizas. Aquel hombre era el líder del Clan, el mismo que había salvado a Maléfica cuando estuvo al borde de la muerte. Con voz solemne le reveló un secreto, su poder provenía de la sangre del Fénix que corría por sus venas entre todas las hadas oscuras. Solo ella poseía esa herencia y por eso estaba destinada a guiar a su pueblo hacia la luz. Pero ese camino no sería fácil. De repente, un guerrero oscuro trajo noticias alarmantes. La reina había enviado tropas que estaban cazando en los límites de su territorio. Maléfica partió con algunos compañeros para comprobarlo, sin saber que los humanos ya habían preparado una emboscada. En cuestión de segundos, una lluvia de balas de hierro llenó el aire. En el instante más crítico, el líder apareció y se interpuso, recibiendo todos los disparos. Para salvarla, Maléfica levantó un muro de enredaderas para contener la segunda oleada y bajo la cobertura de los guerreros lograron escapar con vida. Al regresar al nido, encontraron al líder agonizando con su último aliento, transfirió todo su poder a Maléfica y y con una mirada Serena se despidió del mundo, soñando con la paz. Su muerte destruyó la confianza que ella aún conservaba en los humanos. La guerra final era inevitable. El sonido de los tambores retumbó mientras la reina iniciaba la segunda fase de su plan. Bajo el pretexto de la boda de la princesa, envió invitaciones a todas las criaturas mágicas del reino de moors con la intención de reunirlas para aniquilarlas de una vez. Las inocentes hadas creyeron en sus palabras y acudieron entusiasmadas para celebrar a la princesa, sin sospechar que marchaban hacia una trampa mortal. La princesa, ignorante de todo es, esperaba la ceremonia llena de ilusión. Pero cuando el príncipe le regaló una flor del más allá, una especie que solo existía en el reino de morse, y mencionó que provenía de la reina, algo en su interior comenzó a inquietarla. Movida por la sospecha, entró en secreto al vestidor de la reina, donde un maniquí de aspecto extraño llamó su atención. Giró levemente su cabeza y, para su sorpresa, se abrió una puerta oculta. Siguió el pasadizo y llegó a un laboratorio secreto. Allí, en medio de 1atm oscura, encontró una rueca impregnada de energía maligna. De inmediato comprendió la verdad. El Rey no estaba bajo el hechizo de Maléfica, sino bajo el veneno de la propia reina. Todo el engaño quedó al descubierto, pero ya era demasiado tarde. Mientras tanto, los elfos que asistían al banquete empezaron a notar algo extraño en el ambiente. Entonces, el consejero De la reina presionó una tecla especial del piano y al instante una nube de polvo rojo se extendió desde todos los rincones del salón, sellando el destino de los inocentes

I don't know. I can't even say it. I don't know what it is. Something was like a ball and it what? Meredith? What? Get up. Come on, Dr Shepherd, just one moment. Katie competes in beauty pageants. I know that, but we have to save her life anyway, okay? She has no headaches, no neck pain, her CT is clean. There's no medical proof of an aneurysm, right? But what if she has an aneurysm anyway, there are no indicators. Oh, but she twisted her ankle a few weeks ago when she was practicing for the pageant. Look, I appreciate you trying. Now she fell when she twisted her ankle, she fell. It was no big deal, not even a bump on the head, you know, she got right back up, ice her ankle and everything was fine. It was a Faso minor. Her doctor didn't even think to mention it when I was taking her history. But she did, she did fall. Well, you know what? The chances are that a meteor could burst into an asteroid in one in a million, literally. Let's go where? Right out of Katie's. One in a million.

There were three police cars and an ambulance outside his building. Yellow tape blocked off the entrance. I parked and ran over Charlie's neighbor. Mrs. Chen was talking to a police officer while crying. What happened, I asked her. Oh, honey, Charlie's gone. What do you mean gone? The officer stepped forward. Are you a friend of Charles Hooper? He's my best friend. What happened? I'm sorry to tell you this, but Mr Hooper passed away last night, suicide. My legs gave out and I sat on the curb. Nothing made sense. Charlie was 22 years old. He was supposed to be complaining about his boss at the hardware store right now. Are you Marcus? The officer asked. Yeah. He left letters. You're one of them. So are Aaron and Mabel. At the station, I read Charlie's letter with shaking hands. Six months ago, my parents and little sister died when a drunk driver hit them. They left me everything, the house and insurance money, their savings, almost $400,000. But I can't look at it without seeing them. And I can't Keep going without them. You three were the only ones who talked to me when everyone bullied me in high school. You sat with me at lunch when the football team threw food at me. You included me when no one else would. I'm giving the money to the only family I have left. I'm sorry, Charlie. I broke down sobbing. Charlie had been grieving alone for six months and never told us his family only died. All those times he said he was busy when we wanted to hang out, he was probably at their graves. The officer explained the money was legally ours. Charlie had a lawyer set everything up properly. He'd been planning this for weeks. While we had no idea he was suffering. We used some of the money for Charlie's funeral, white roses everywhere, because he loved those. The rest sits in our accounts mostly untouched. But I kind of need to buy a new body pillow.

My son has autism. So bringing him to my cousin's wedding felt like bringing a loaded gun with the safety off because with his autism comes this brutal honesty that terrifies me in social situations. Last month at our family barbecue, he walked up to his aunt and said, Auntie, I have a question for you. When she encouraged him to continue, he said, I thought healthy food was supposed to make you skinny near but you always talk about how your diet is so good and you're the fattest person I know. She turned so red with embarrassment she had to go home. Don't get me wrong, I found it extremely funny. If anything, he made everything better. But sometimes his bravery scared me. So before the wedding, I sat him down in the parking lot and tried to negotiate with him like he was a government official. Remember what we talked about? Sometimes our thoughts need to stay in our heads. His little face scrunched up the way it does when he's processing something important. But what if someone's being mean to you, dad? The protective tone in his voice made my chest tight with love. Then we'll handle it together, okay? But let's try to keep quiet today. We pinky promised and that was enough for me to believe him. When we went inside. The ceremony went better. Than I expected, my son sat still, only stimming with his fingers during the vows, which made my heart swell with pride for how far he'd come since I adopted him. I stealing glances at him, being scared that he would break our promise and announce that the best man had food in his teeth or that someone's baby looked angry, but he didn't say anything. I actually started to relax. Maybe we'd make it through without an incident. But then came the wedding reception. My cousin's new husband, Derek, was giving his speech, all perfect white teeth and expensive suit, thanking his groomsmen for the bachelor party. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, said with this wink that made some people laugh nervously. A wave of confusion washed over me. Something felt off about that, but I pushed it aside and handed my son a fidget cube to play with. Things were smooth sailing and I wanted to enjoy myself. So during dinner, I reached for the bread basket, planning on getting as fat as his auntie. That, that's when it happened. Right as my arm was out, Derek walked behind my chair. My elbow caught my wine glass and red wine splashed across his shoe. The entire table went silent. What the hell is wrong with you, Derek's voice boomed, making my son flinch. Don't you know these shoes cost more than your car? My face burned with embarrassment as I grabbed napkins to clean him off. Apologizing repeatedly, trying to wipe the leather while everyone stared. But Derek wasn't done. Maybe next time, leave the autistic kid at home and pay for a sitter. This is exactly why we only invited family, out of obligation. The words hit me like a punch. I instantly hated Derek. I was ready to grab my son and leave. I glanced at my son and saw his hands starting to flap, his breathing getting quicker. That was his warning sign, like something was going to happen. I put my hand on his shoulder, whispering that it was okay, that we'd leave soon, anything to calm him down. But his eyes were locked on Derek with that intense focus he gets when he's about to say something he thinks is absolutely necessary. My son stood up so suddenly his chair scraped against the floor. He was upset, but not for himself, for me. You shouldn't talk to my dad like that, he declared. His voice was clear, cutting through the reception hall chatter. Derek turned his face red from a mixture of alcohol and irritation. Sit down, kid. That dismissive tone only made my son more upset. What happened next felt like slow motion. My son straightened his shoulders and with the same matter of fact tone he uses to announce that dinner is ready or that it's raining outside, he said, you should sit down.

She walked past me and stopped in front of my brother. The room applauded until I asked my father one question. Then my wife went pale and my brother collapsed. My wife took my brother's hand. He stood up, smiling that cocky smile I'd seen my whole life. They walked to the dance floor together. Two hundred guests watched them sway to the music. I stood at the head table, completely still. My best man leaned over. Dude, what the hell? I didn't answer because three weeks ago, I'd found the months of messages between my wife Sarah and my brother Derek. I wish it was you I was marrying. 10 years we've hidden this. I'm tired of pretending. After the wedding, we'll figure it out. Just play along for now. They've been having an affair for a decade, since before Sarah and I even started dating. She chosen me as the safe option, the stable one. But she never stop sleeping with Derek. And tonight, at our wedding, she was making her move. I known for three weeks, and I planned for three weeks. The song ended. Sarah and Derek pulled apart, both glowing. The crowd applauded. Sarah walked back toward me, a triumphant look in her eyes. I picked up the microphone. Beautiful dance, I said, my voice calm, really touching. Sarah smiled. Derek raised his Glass to me. Actually, I continued, since we're sharing secrets tonight, I have one, too. Sarah's smile flickered. Dad, I said, turning to where my father sat, do you remember that business loan Derek asked you for three years ago? The one for $50,000? My father looked confused. Of course. Why? Did he ever pay you back? Dad's face darkened. No, he said. The business failed. I nodded. Interesting, because I have the bank record showing that business never existed. The room went quiet. Derek's face went pale. What are you doing? He said, his voice tight. I'm sharing, I said pleasantly. Like you and Sarah have been sharing for 10 years. Gasps rippled through the crowd. Sarah's hand flew to her mouth. The $50,000 dad gave you. You spent it on hotel rooms, trips, gifts for Sarah, all while she was dating me. I pulled out my phone and connected it to the projector. I have every receipt, every text message, every lie. The screen lit up behind me. Text messages between Sarah and Derek filled the wall. I can't wait to be with you for real. He'll never suspect anything. After the wedding, we'll figure out how to tell him. My mother stood up, her hand over her heart. Derek, is this true? Derek couldn't speak. But that's not even the best part, I said. Sarah, do you want to tell everyone or should I? She was crying now. Please stop. Stop. We're just getting to the good Part I advanced the slideshow. A photo of a marriage certificate appeared, Derek's name and another woman's name.

When I was 7, I was attacked by a German Shepherd. I nearly died after three surgeries. But I never told my husband grant, because his whole family raises golden retrievers and they literally have more photos with dogs than with people. On our third date, grant suggested we visit a dog park and I panicked and said I'm allergic. When his face just dropped, I add and severely allergic. And now it's been eight years of this ridiculous lie. I carry fake Epipens filled with Vitamin Water like some kind of spy. I've left 17 birthday parties doing my whole itchy eyes performance. The worst part is our kids beg for a dog every single Christmas and grant always tells them, you know, mom can't be around dogs. Sweetie could kill her. I'm literally going to hell. Then after about a week, I started to notice grant has been doing laundry constantly now, which is weird because this man once wore the same shirt for a week. He says he just wants to help more, but something feels really off about it. My son suddenly volunteers to take out the trash every single day and he literally sprints to the garage, then to the bins like he's training for the Olympics. He won't even let me help when the bags are heavy. Meanwhile, my daughter keeps spending time in the garage organizing dad's tools, which makes zero Sense because this girl thinks a Philip's head is a hair style. But then I find these muddy paw prints by the garage door yesterday. And they're definitely not from a cat like grant claims because what cat has paws the size of a toddler's hand? There's creepy scratching sounds from the garage at night and grant says it's probably raccoons. But since when do raccoons whimper? Then credit card Bill comes in and I see it has a 47 dollar charge from Petsmart. Grant says it's fraudulent and he'll handle it, but he never actually calls the bank about. I find a bag of dog food in Grant's trunk when I'm getting groceries and he says it's for donations at work. But his office doesn't even have a coffee fund, let alone donation drives. This morning I wake up and there's blonde hair on my pillow. That confirms it for me. And I'm about to fake a reaction, but, and my brain kicks in because if I have an allergic reaction now, grant will wonder why I didn't have one while I was literally sleeping face first in it all night. So I just vacuum it up quickly and pretend I saw nothing. Grant starts testing me at dinner, casually mentions the neighbour got a new puppy and watches my face like he's a detective. So I have to do my whole routine, scratch my arms and sniffle. But he looks suspicious. My son asks, mom, what happens if Someone with allergies accidentally touches a dog but doesn't know. My heart stops and I ask why this little boy has the nerve to say just curious for science class. But I know they're studying volcanoes. My daughter leaves her phone open to Google searches about how to tell if someone is really allergic and can allergies suddenly go away, which makes my stomach drop because my 12 year old is apparently Sherlock Holmes. Now this morning grant says he found fur on our bed sheets. He shows me this chunk of long golden fur and says the window was open, must have blown in from somewhere. So I have to pretend to feel itchy and take a fake Benadryl in front of him. All the while he watches me swallow it like he's monitoring a science experiment. I even had to open my mouth and lift up my tongue. Then he says something that makes my blood freeze. Funny thing, I found your allergy medication in the bathroom. And he holds up my prescription bottle. I looked up these pills and the markings don't match Benadryl. They match vitamin C tablets. He continues and his voice is so calm it's terrifying. Also, you slept on that pillow with fur for hours with no reaction. And yesterday when you were napping, something else happened in our bed that should have sent you to the hospital. I literally can't breathe because he knows. They all know. But then he says we Need to talk in the garage, all of us right now. I follow them like I'm walking to my execute. I open the door and immediately find a golden retriever puppy jumping on me, licking my entire face, fur absolutely everywhere. And my skin doesn't react. No hives, no sneezing, nothing. Instead, I scream bloody murder and trip trying to run away. My daughter starts crying and grant says quietly, this dog slept in our bed yesterday. Your pillow. Actually. We have a video. That's when my son whispers, three months we've had him three months. The dog brings me a tennis ball like we're best friends and nobody knows what to say.

His bride told me I wasn't welcome, so I took back the honeymoon tickets and left. on everyone's face when I walked out with that envelope was priceless. But what they didn't know was that those tickets were just the begin thing of what I was about to take back. Sarah, my brother David's new wife, stood there in her $5 a thousand dollar dress with this smug smile as she delivered the new news. We've decided this is a family only Celebration now, she announced loud enough for half the reception to hear. Her voice dripping with fake sweetness. And since you're not really family, the crystal champagne flute slipped from my hand, shattering against the marble floor of the Beverly Hills Country Club. The sound cutting through the classical music like a knife. The entire reception fell silent. 200 guests turn and to stare as Sarah's parents nodded approvingly behind her. And my own parents, my own parents just stood there looking uncomfortable but saying nothing. David, my brother, who I'd helped through college, who I'd bailed out of trouble more times than I could count, wouldn't even meet my eyes. Sarah savored every second of my humiliation. Her perfectly manicured fingers adjusting her pearl necklace as she waited for me to break down and beg. Instead, I reached into my purse, pulled out a thick vanilla envelope and smiled. I'm Megan Martinez, 28, and I've been planning weddings for LA's elite, for the Past six years, David is my younger brother by three years. And until that moment, I thought we were close. I'd spent the last eight months planning his dream wedding to Sarah, a woman I never particularly liked but tolerated for his sake. What David didn't know, what none of them knew, was that I hadn't just planned this wedding. I paid for most of it. And I was about to remind everyone exactly who held the real power in this beautifully decorated room. The thing about being a wedding planner in Beverly Hills is that you learn to plan for everything, including betrayal. As I stood there holding that envelope, watching Sarah's confident smirk start to falter, I realized this was going to be even more satisfying than I'd imagined, Sarah had just made the biggest mistake of her perfectly planned life, and she didn't even know it yet. Sarah had started her campaign against me six months ago, right after David proposed, began with little comments about how I was too involved in their relationship, how I needed to find my own life instead of living through David. She convinced him that I was jealous of their happiness, that my suggestions for the wedding were attempts to control them. Slowly but surely, she began cutting me out of decisions I'd been making, claiming she wanted the wedding to reflect their vision, not anyone else's. The irony was almost too perfect. Sarah came from old money. Her father owned A chain of high end jewelry stores across California. But their finances were tied up in investments and real estate. They looked wealthy, lived wealthy, but had surprisingly little liquid cash. That's why they'd been so grateful when I offered to help with wedding expenses. It's my gift to you both, I'd said, wanting David to have the wedding of his dreams. I'd covered the venue deposit, the catering, the flowers, the band, even those honeymoon ticket to Bora Bora that were burning a hole in my purse. David had been uncomfortable taking money from me at first, but Sarah quickly convinced him it was family helping family. She became positively giddy about spending what she thought was my generous contribution to their happiness. She upgraded everything, the caviar service.

My husband's friend Kate always had to be the main character in every situation. When someone else had good news, Kate suddenly had better news. At group dinners, she'd hijack any conversation within five minutes. I couldn't stand her, but I put up with it because she and Zach had been friends since college. After my husband and I announced our pregnancy at 12 weeks, things with Kate got really weird. Suddenly, Kate was everywhere we went sporting a small baby bump. She showed up at our favorite brunch spot rubbing her belly. She enrolled in our exact prenatal yoga class. She even switched to our OB practice. Nobody questioned it because these things happen, and women get pregnant at the same time. She posted weekly bump photos on Instagram, and everyone congratulated her just like they did me. Three months in, one of our friends mentioned something strange at a girls night. She said Kate's belly looked bigger than previous Tuesday at book club than it did at Saturday's barbecue. When she brought it up, Kate burst into tears about how cruel it was to comment on a pregnant woman's body. She went on about water retention and bloating and how pregnant women deal with enough judgment without their friends piling on. Our friend felt terrible and apologized profusely while the rest of us comforted Kate. After that night, nobody dared mention anything about her appearance again. Even though I started Noticing her bump size seemed to wait, too. That's when things got uncomfortable. Kate started making comments about how wild it was that we got pregnant around the same time. She'd joke about our babies being best friends, or maybe even more than friends someday. Then the jokes got stranger, like when she said pregnancy brain made her forget exactly when she conceived and wasn't it funny how close our due dates were? She started showing up at every single appointment Zach and I had, always in the waiting room when we arrived, claiming her appointment was right before or after hours. During our maternity photo shoot at the park, she appeared with her own photographer, saying what a coincidence that she booked the same spot. The photographer later told me Kate had called asking what time we'd be there. Everything exploded at my baby shower. My sister threw this beautiful garden party with all our family and friends there to celebrate. Halfway through opening gifts, Kate stood up and clinked her glass to make an announcement. With tears streaming down her face, she placed her hand on her belly and said, I have the most wonderful news to share with everyone. Zach and I are having a baby together! The entire party gasped, and she continued with a huge smile, I know this is unconventional, but isn't it beautiful that our babies will be siblings?

I commented first night of freedom, actually. And tagged her dad. I was working late Thursday night while my fiance Brianna had what she called a low key bachelorette with her bridesmaids. Just dinner and wine at her friend Chloe's place. She said our wedding was in nine days. Around eleven PM my phone buzzed with Instagram notifications. Rihanna had posted last night of freedom. The photo showed her straddling some guys laugh at a club, not Chloe's apartment. His hands were on her waist, she was kissing his neck. More photos rolled in, her grinding on him, him doing body shots off her bridesmaids cheering. The final one showed them making out with his hand up her dress. Caption what happens at Bachelorette, stays at Bachelorette. Except when you post it publicly. Screenshot everything. Then commented first night of freedom, actually. Weddings off. Changed my relationship status to single. Then I tagged her dad. Raymond why? Because Raymond paid for the entire 80 thousand dollar wedding. He'd specifically told Brianna no wild parties as his business partners would attend. The man owns three car dealerships and guards his reputation. Within minutes my phone exploded with calls. I turned it off. Next morning someone was laying on my doorbell. Brianna's mom, Denise, with Brianna and toe makeup smeared, still in her club dress, crying how dare you humiliate my daughter, Denise! She humiliated Herself. I just pointed it out.

You can't cancel now. Do you know how this will make me look? Not. I'm sorry. Just worried about appearances. Three hours later, a news van appeared.

The segment groom Social Media Revenge goes too far. But it backfired spectacularly. Someone found her deleted Instagram posts and shared screenshots in the news station's Facebook comments. Brutal responses. Harmless fun. She was dry humping him and she posted it publicly. And he's wrong for responding. Even better, the guy from the club saw the broadcast. His name was Trent and he was married. His wife recognized him and went nuclear on Facebook. Turns out Brianna had given Trent her number. They've been texting for days. She'd sent nudes, telling him she was in an open relationship and her wedding was just for show. Raymond called me that afternoon. First time we talked alone.

You get nothing when we die. Then Grandma's lawyer called. The call came while I was eating cereal before my shift at the auto parts store. Austin called. Well, this is Margaret Stevens, estate attorney. Your grandmother Eleanor left you something. I almost laughed. There's been a mistake. My parents said I wasn't in her will. Mr. Called. Well, we need to meet immediately. Two hours later, I'm staring at documents. Two $2.1 million a house, investment accounts. All mine. But I'm adopted, I stammered. Margaret handed me a letter in Grandma's handwriting. Austin, you are not adopted. You're my biological grandson. Your father's first wife, Jennifer, was your real mother. She died when you were two. Susan made David pretend you were adopted because she wanted you gone. My hand shook. Twenty one years of being treated like garbage while my siblings got cars and vacations. I work two jobs just to afford ramen. Every family dinner where they discuss college funds for Logan and Ashley. But when I asked about help with community college, dad would say, you need to learn independence letter continued, David and Susan think they're inheriting everything. They've been spending money they don't have. The new truck, kitchen remodel, Logan's boat. They borrowed against my estate. They get nothing. But there was more. Margaret pulled out another folder. Your grandmother hired a private investigator three years ago. She documented everything. Photos of me walking to work in the rain because My bike broke. Screenshots of my parents social media posts. Bragging about their inheritance windfall. While I lived on peanut butter sandwiches. Messages between Susan and her friends. Can't wait for the old bat to die so we can finally live properly. The investigator had recorded conversations, too. Susan's voice came through crystal clear. Austin thinks he's family, but he's just David's mistake from his first marriage. Once Eleanor's gone, we'll have enough money to cut him off. Complete. Your grandmother was furious. Margaret said she changed her will six months ago. Your parents get nothing. Your siblings get $1,000 each. Everything else goes to you. The best part? The investigator had proof they'd already spent two hundred thousand dollars. They didn't have new credit cards, loans against their expected inheritance. Deposits on a vacation home in Florida. I drove to their house with Margaret. It was Friday night, their weekly family dinner that I was never invited to. Through the window, I could see them celebrating. With champagne. And expensive to take out. Susan opened the door, saw us both, and her face lit up with greed. Finally. Margaret, right? How much did mother leave us? We've been waiting so patiently. Logan and Ashley crowded behind her, practically bouncing with excitement. David appeared with a bottle of champagne, ready to toast their good fortune. I smiled. Actually, she left me everything. And this letter explaining how you lied about me being adopted. Susan's face went white. That's impossible. You're Not even real family. Oh, but I am. I pulled out the birth certificate grandma had kept safe. My mother was Jennifer Caldwell. You know, Dad's first wife. The one you made him pretend never exist.

We're literally about to graduate and my friends still try to set me up with their less attractive cousins or suggest maybe I should try guys instead. Not kidding. Last week, my roommate Josh literally downloaded Grindr on my phone while I was sleeping. Because maybe you'll have better luck there, bro. Being the designated ugly friend in a group of former high school athletes didn't help. They all had their glow UPS in college while I stayed the same skinny guy with acne scars and glasses. At every party, they introduced me as their great personality friend to Girls, Code for not hot but nice. My buddy Trent still makes tinder profiles for me without asking, always writing BIOS like he's really funny once you get to know him, like I'm some charity case. Dad constantly jokes that i'm their gay best friend who hasn't come out yet whenever i don't immediately hit on girls at parties. Last friday at o'malley's was peak humiliation. The whole crew was there, josh, trent, brad, tommy, even guys from our intramural team. We're grabbing drinks at the bar when this absolutely gorgeous waitress walks by, blonde, tall, looks like she could be on magazine covers. Josh immediately starts the usual competition. Fifty bucks to whoever gets her number. Trent UPS it 100 if you get her to go out with you. They're all strategizing, doing push UPS in the bar to pump up their Arms practicing pickup lines. Brad looks at me and laughs. Yo, maybe you should sit this one out. We don't want to scare her off before the real players get a chance. Tommy chimes in. Yeah, you can be our wingman. Tell her your hot friends are single. The bartender mentions she's the most requested server they have. Guys specifically ask for her section. My friends lose their minds. We need her section. Josh demands we wait 45 minutes just to sit in.

They were made by like one human being with a weird idea and a god complex and somehow that game changed your whole brain chemistry. you can tell when a game was made by someone who sat there thinking, I need this to mean something. The music hits, the visuals are unique and the story makes you feel like someone actually understands what being alive feels like. Meanwhile, DDD Studios drop another sequel with the emotional depth of a cereal box and expect praise because the shadows are ray traced. Like cool, your water physics are great. Why do I want to uninstall after 15 minutes? And don't get me started on Nintendo right now. These people are out here selling the same underpowered hardware with a fancy number slapped on it like we don't see the scam. Oh look, it's the switch too. Only for the cheap price of 74, 49 kroners and the games are 90 bucks. Nintendo, I love you, but I think I'll stick with my Switch Lite in Mario Odyssey. I'm sorry, but I don't care if your console has legacy branding. If I have to duct tape my Joy Cons and pray it runs 30 fps and handheld, you are not winning. Meanwhile, indie devs are making entire masterpieces in RPG Maker or unity with $15 and trauma as their only resources. And it's always them, the weird quiet devs who Vanish for two years and come back like, hey, I made a 6 hour psychological RPG about grief, identity and childhood trauma. The combat's kind of cool too. And it slaps. No micro transactions, no fake hype, just pure vision and effort. Indie games care. AIA games calculate. One feels like art, the other feels like a Powerpoint.

But I'm not attracted to him anymore. Like, at all. Haven't been for months. I'm just waiting for the right time to leave. After the holidays or after I get the promotion. His dad's firm already wrote me that recommendation letter, so I'm good there. Her friend laughed. Girl, you're still planning the wedding, though. I know it's bad, but breaking off an engagement is such a hassle. Everyone's bought tickets, we've got deposits everywhere. Plus, I've got three job interviews lined up from his family's connections. I just need to time this right. Does he know? Please. He's completely clueless. Still brings me coffee every morning like a lost puppy. It's honestly kind of pathetic how oblivious he is.

The part where you're using my family's connections. The part where I'm pathetic and clueless. She grabbed my arm. Wait. Please talk privately. Why? You had no problem calling me pathetic in front of her. Two minutes ago. I was just venting. For months? While planning your exit strategy and milking my family connections. She started crying. You're twisting my words. What context makes I'm not attracted to him anymore sound better? I packed a bag. She called 17 times that night. I didn't answer once.

Hidden in the legal text was a clause about existing guardianship agreements. Then I saw it. A name I didn't recognize, listed as co guardian. Who's Patricia Denison? I asked. My sister's face went pale. That's mom's Maiden name. Social worker confirmed it. My mother had filed a competing petition three weeks ago under her legal name, claiming I was mentally unstable. She'd submitted my therapy records from when I was 17, records from after dad left, when I'd struggled with depression. She told me two days ago. My sister whispered. Said if I warned you, she'd cut me off financially. My kids college fund, their school tuition, everything. She has the account passwords. I stared at her. So you were just going to let me sign? No, I couldn't. That's why I'm here. The social worker cleared her throat. I need to inform you that missus Denison's petition will likely take residents. She has financial stability, a four bedroom home, and these psychological records create concerns. About your fitness. This is a guardian. I look at my nephew playing with locks in the corner. He'd been calling me dad for six months now. Every morning he'd ask when he could stop visiting Grandma's house and just stay with me forever. How did she even get my medical records? I ask. She's listed as your emergency contact from when you were a minor. The social worker explained she requested them last month. Claimed it was for insurance purposes. My sister pulled out her phone. There's something else you need to know. She played a recording. Mom's voice came through clearly. Listen carefully, cause I'm only saying this once.

I've already spoken to Judge Morrison. We go to the same church. Understands that a single man with a history of mental illness shouldn't be raising a traumatized child alone. My stomach dropped. She went to the judge directly, ex parte communication, the social worker said. Suddenly interested. That's not allowed. What else is on there? My sister kept playing clips. In one, mom bragged about hiring a private investigator to follow me, hoping to catch me drinking or bringing dates home. In another, she discussed coaching Liam to say he was scared of me during the custody evaluation. He's 4 years old. I said she was going to make him lie. The most damning recording came last. Mom talking to someone named Walter, probably her attorney. I don't care if it's unethical. I need those therapy records submitted before the hearing. If the court sees he was suicidal at 17, they'll never give him custody, will paint it as ongoing instability. And the social worker stopped recording. I need copies of everything. This changes the entire case. My sister looked at me with tears in her eyes. She threatened to take my house. She co signed the mortgage, but I couldn't let her do this to you and Liam. I asked the social worker, what happens now? These recordings show bad faith and potential judicial misconduct. I'll be filing an emergency motion to dismiss her petition and recommending an ethics investigation. Judge Morrison will likely recuse himself. The hearing is next.

Two weeks later, she filed, then backtracked when her plan backfired. My wife, Mona and I had been married four years. Things were solid. That couple everyone envied, effortless rhythm, inside jokes. Then six months ago, everything changed. She started carrying her phone everywhere, even to the kitchen. Added a password she'd never used before, started taking calls outside the room, disappearing to the bedroom or porch. Just a friend from work, she'd say, when I asked. She began keeping her phone face down on tables. One of those details you don't notice until you do. When I'd reach near it, he'd quickly move it away. One Wednesday, she said she was meeting a friend for coffee. I was running errands nearby, figured I'd surprise her. She wasn't with any friend. She was outside the cafe pacing, phone to her ear. I stayed in my car and overheard. It's almost ready and starting fresh soon. When she got home, I asked how coffee went. She told me an elaborate story about her friend's boyfriend. Drama, complete lie. Then came the financial questions. We should organize everything, all our account info, passwords, documents, just in case of emergency. We'd never discussed this. What kind of emergencies? What if something happens to one of us or we need to make big financial decisions quickly? It sounded rehearsed, like she'd been waiting for the right moment. Days later, I checked Our joint account, small transfers over the past month, amounts that didn't match bills or groceries. He was moving money somewhere. I called a lawyer friend after I explained everything. He said, you're not insane for wanting to be ready. If you're concerned about protecting assets, now is the moment. Better safe than sorry. That night, I transferred everything, cash, investments, house deed to my mother's name in an irrevocable trust. Kept enough in our joint account to maintain appearances. Two weeks later, she sat me down. We need to talk. I think we should get a divorce. Calm, rehearse. She mentioned needing space, losing her identity. Then. I've made sacrifices for you over the years. I don't think you appreciate them. I deserve more. Monday, the papers arrived. They demanded everything, half the house, my savings, assets, the car, plus spousal support.

The report made my blood run cold. Multiple lawsuits from landlords and creditors, unpaid back taxes, defaulted car loan. She'd been served papers for property damage three weeks before filing for divorce. She'd been in financial trouble for months, then suddenly remembered she had a husband with assets. Her Instagram, living my best life. No drama, no stress. Eight months ago, she'd shared an article about financial independence after divorce. Never too late to get what you deserve. The PI found Jake, coworker, very involved in her divorce planning. A mutual friend sent me their texts. Once the settlements done, we'll have everything we need. I just need him to agree to the terms. Jake responded, don't back down. Make him feel guilty. He owes you. We'll start fresh once you've got the money. First, mediation. Her lawyer arrived with demands. Half everything, plus support. My attorney handed over paperwork showing all major assets transferred to my mother's trust weeks before she filed. Legal, notarized, irrevocable. The room went silent. She grabbed the papers, face flushing. You plan this? You knew I was going to file and set this up to screw me over? I didn't respond. Just let her connect the dots. Her lawyer tried arguing the transfers could be challenged. My attorney walked through every detail. Dates aligned, signatures notarized, trust legally solid. Nothing they could do. This isn't over, she hissed, leaving the courthouse. There are other Ways to get what I deserve. I looked at her. I already regret trusting you. That's my only regret. The texts with Jake spread among friends. Her story collapsed. Jake vanished when things unraveled, apparently feeding her fantasies. But gone the moment she wasn't getting money. Her lawyer quietly dismissed the case. The trust was unbreakable. She got nothing but her personal belongings. Her final voicemail three weeks later. I'll drop everything if you just talk to me, please. I didn't respond.

That you don't actually have to have an opinion on everything. Watching someone say, I don't know enough about that to comment made me realise silence is an option too. 2, giving a shit. I don't mean in an apathetic way, but growing up, my parents panished about every little thing. Going to the store, a doctor's appointment, a missed piece of mail, dropping a fork, spilling milk on the table. Everything turned into a big deal. But I spent time with other people as a teen slash adult and realised that wasn't normal. The world doesn't end if you burn a pizza or if the water spills over when boiling pasta. That guy who cut you off isn't the worst part of your day. The staff member at the store checking your ID isn't a bad person. You can just not react to those things and life gets a whole lot easier. 3. A person was talking stupid and the person didn't argue but just got up and walked away without saying a word. 4. Saying thank you for the invitation, but I slash we won't be able to make it to a social invite without providing a detailed explanation about why you can't attend. Five, not opening the door when the doorbell rings. 6, using the fancy cups, plates, etcetera. Mum was flabbergasted when I made her a cup of Tea using the China from her display cabinet. If not now, then when? Why shouldn't we use it when we can? 7. Seeing someone just not for small talk made me realise you don't have to fill every silence. And watching friends say, I'm too tired to go without guilt taught me that you're allowed to honour your energy without explaining yourself.

I was chilling on my bed with my roommate when I got a Snapchat ad from Quick Add. His name was Connor and I was bored. So I added him back because why not? In our first convo, he was super chill and talked about normal stuff, relationships, family drama, stuff like that. That's when he asked how old I was. My roommate Audrey grabbed my phone and started typing for me, oh, I'm actually 15. How old are you? And I, I was dying laughing because at the time I was really 21. But when we saw his response, our laughter died in our throats. He said, oh, wow, that's young. I'm 28, but I hope we can keep talking. You seem really mature and I'm sure you're really cute. Lol heart emoji. Me and Audrey just stared at each other. Was this man for real? He was using all the classic signs of grooming, not even trying to hide it. I should have blocked him right there. something made me curious about how far this creep would actually go. So me and Audrey responded with, thanks, Poppy, and laughed. Over the next few days, Connor kept messaging me these weird compliments about how I was different from other girls my age and how he wished he could help take care of me. Then one night after we've been playing those stupid Snapchat games for like three hours straight. He sent me something that changed everything. $100, the message said, for being so sweet and making my nights less lonely. I stared at my phone screen and screenshotted it for Audrey. A hundred dollars for literally just sending Snapchats back and forth. Audrey replied saying, look him dry. The moral part of my brain was screaming at me saying this wasn't the right thing to do. But the other side of me, the broke college student who didn't want to work at the campus coffee shop anymore, wanted more from him. That's when Connor sent something else that made my skin crawl. His home and work addresses. I want you to know you can trust me, baby girl, he wrote. See, I'm being totally open with you. I screenshotted everything. Immediately this weird feeling in my stomach telling me I need this later. From there, every Friday, Connor would send me $500 it.

I couldn't keep a secret anymore. My pen froze above the signature line. The social worker shifted uncomfortably. I've been trying to adopt my nephew for eight months, ever since my brother died in that construction accident. His ex wife had signed away her rights without a fight, which should have been my first red flag. I flipped to the last page. Hidden in the legal text was a clause about existing guardianship agreements. Then I saw it, a name I didn't recognize listed as co guardian. Who's Patricia Denison, I asked. My sister's face went pale. That's mom's Maiden name. Social worker confirmed it. My mother had filed a competing petition three weeks ago under her legal name claiming I was mentally unstable. She'd submitted my therapy records from when I was 17, records from after dad left when I'd struggled with depression. She told me two days ago, my sister whispered, said if I warned you, she'd cut me off financially. My kids college fund, their school tuition, everything. She has the account passwords. I stared at her. So you were just going to let me sign? No, I couldn't. That's why I'm here. Social worker cleared her throat. I need to inform you that Mrs. Denison's petition will likely take precedence. She has financial stability, a four bedroom home and these psychological records create concerns about Your fitness. This is a guardian. I look at my nephew playing with locks in the corner. He'd been calling me dad for six months now. Every morning he'd ask when he could stop visiting Grandma's house and just stay with me forever. How did she even get my medical records, I ask? She's listed as your emergency contact from when you were a minor. The social worker explained she requested them last month, claimed it was for insurance purposes. My sister pulled out her phone. There's something else you need to know. She played a recording. Mom's voice came through clearly. Listen carefully cause I'm only saying this once. That boy belongs with family who can actually provide for him. Your brother lives in a one bedroom apartment and works as a mechanic. I have a proper home, retirement savings and respect in this community. My sister's voice responded, but Liam loves him. He cries every time we pick him up. Children don't know what's best for them. I raised three kids successfully. I know how to do this properly. Your brother?

I proposed to her thinking she was kind, generous, the person she is when we're alone, his voice cracked slightly. But after tonight, after really watching how she treats you, I realized something. The person I thought I was marrying doesn't exist. She's performing. And when the performance drops, This is who she really is. He looked directly at me. You're exactly who I wish she was, patient, genuine, someone who doesn't need to tear others down to feel important. My heart was pounding. Nathan, don't. I'm not saying this to make things weird. I'm saying it because I can't marry her. Not after seeing this. He pulled the engagement ring off his finger. I'm ending it tonight. She'll blame me. She'll blame everyone but herself. But that's not your problem anymore. He walked back inside minutes later shouting, bar doors, gravel. My sister called 37 times. I didn't answer. Three days later, she showed up at 2:00am, makeup smeared, shaking. You seduced him. You ruined my life. I looked at her and felt nothing. Good night, Claire. I closed the door. Six months later, I ran into Nathan at a coffee shop. He smiled, still taking it. I smiled back. Not anymore.

I was still half asleep and confused when I realised what happened. I tried to explain, but he cut me off. You're literally just laying in blood right now. That's disgusting. I got up immediately, took a shower and changed into a disc. When I came back to bed, he wouldn't even look at me. He just rolled over and went to sleep. I barely slept that night. The next day, I went to work and didn't hear from him at all, not a single text. Tuesday afternoon, he showed up at my apartment to talk. He sat down and told me that every time he thinks about me now, all he can picture is a child in a diaper. Then he asked if I used them, like if I peed in them. I said, of course not, they're just for periods. He said he didn't believe me and that I was hiding this gross fetish from him, that he wasted two years on our relationship. I tried explaining why I only wore them when he wasn't around, that I knew they weren't attractive. I even told him I'd stop using them completely because I loved him and didn't wanna lose him. He said he'd think about it, but then added that I needed to talk to my doctor about changing my birth control. He wants me on something that stops my period entirely because now the thought of me having one grosses him out. I told him I didn't wanna change my birth control. The one I'm on works great for me and I don't wanna mess with my hormones. Got really mad and said I was being selfish, that changing birth control is such a simple thing to do to make him feel better about our relationship. He kept pushing until I agreed to at least talk to my doctor. I have an appointment Friday, but I already know I'm not going to change it. My body, my choice, right? But now I'm sitting here wondering if I'm actually in the wrong. Like maybe I should have told him about the period underwear from the start or maybe I should just change my birth control to save the relationship. I don't know anymore.

My husband Alex and I have been married for a year. We've been having unprotected sex pretty regularly because we're married and honestly, just stopped being, being super careful about it. Last week, I realized my period was late, like two weeks late. So I took three pregnancy tests just to be sure and they all came back positive. I was actually really excited because I've always wanted to be a mom. I waited until Alex got home from work to tell him. I had this whole moment planned in my head where we'd hug and maybe cry happy tears together. He walked in around 6 and I told him to sit down because I had something important to share. I was smiling so big when I said it. I'm pregnant. We're going to have a baby. I thought he'd be happy or at least surprised in a good way. Instead, his face went completely white, then red. Then he stood up and started pacing around our living room. How the hell did this happen, he asked. His voice was getting louder with each word. I tried to explain that we hadn't been using Protection for months, so this wasn't exactly shocking. He just kept shaking his head like I was lying to him. We went back and forth for maybe five minutes with me trying to calm him down and him getting more And more worked up. Then he stopped pacing and looked right at me. I want a paternity test. There's no way this is my baby. I felt like someone punched me in the stomach. I asked him what he meant and he said it again, paternity test. Cause he didn't believe the baby was his. I've never cheated on Alex, not even close. I don't even talk to other guys beyond normal work stuff and casual hellos to neighbors. I've never given him a single reason to think I'd cheat. I was so shocked I couldn't even form words for a minute when I finally spoke.

She'd be stumbling around drunk trying to get everyone's attention. There were at least two times where she almost got assaulted by guys at parties. Another time, some kids parents came home early and found her in a bedroom with multiple guys. They called my dad and there was this whole drama. My dad started asking me to watch out for her at school and at parties. Just make sure she's okay. He'd say, make sure she's not getting into anything dangerous. I told him straight up that it's not my job and I don't care enough about her to babysit her. He tried pulling the whole she's your sister card, but I shut that down immediately. She's not my sister. She's the reason I grew up without a dad. Last week, Emmy went missing for three days. Nobody knew where she was. My dad was freaking out, calling everyone, posting on Facebook. I saw her on the second day outside school with some older guy who looked like he was in his 20s. They we're sitting in his car and she looked out of it like maybe high or drunk. I just walked past and went to class. When my dad found out I'd seen her and didn't say anything, he completely lost it. He actually showed up at my mom's house screaming at me on the front lawn. Our neighbors were watching and everything. He was yelling about how I could have helped find her, how I'm a terrible person. How family is supposed to look out for each other? I just stood there and told him I don't care. That seemed to break something in him because he said maybe it's better if I don't come to his house anymore, which honestly would be perfect for everyone. Emmy hasn't been back to school since she was found at that guy's house. I don't know if she's okay or if something bad happened to her. And the crazy part is I really don't care at all, which made me wonder if maybe I'm messed up because even though we hate each other, we've technically known each other our whole lives.

My dad cheated on my mom when they were both pregnant with me. I'm 16 now and I'm his only son. My half sister Emmy is also 16 because we were born around the same time. When my mom found out about the cheating, she divorced my dad and he chose Emmy and her mom over us. Like he basically disappeared from my life. My mom raised me by herself while he played happy family with them. I'm pretty sure he even went to jail for not paying child support because kids at school kept talking about it.

Anyway, then last year, out of nowhere, my dad decided he wanted to be in my life again. He got a lawyer and forced visitation. So now I have to spend three nights a month at his house with his perfect little family. Amy hates me just as much as I hate her. She's jealous that I'm his only son and thinks that's the only reason he wants me around now. She's always talking trash about my mom, calling her names and saying horrible things. So I talk trash about her mom right back, reminding her that her mom is The one who slept with a married man. Ever since my dad started forcing me to visit Emmy has completely gone off the rails, like seriously dangerous stuff. She started drinking at parties, doing drugs, hooking up with random guys. She'd get in cars with guys who drive like maniacs going like 90 miles an hour down residential streets. I still go to some parties with my friends and I'd see her there.

So I stopped answering calls or texts. A week later, she went missing, and suddenly, they were begging me for help. My little sister, Riley, 17, and has type 1 diabetes. Parents both work graveyard shifts at different hospitals. So growing up, I basically raised her. I'm talking 2:00am, blood sugar checks, packing her insulin, making sure she ate before school, the whole thing. My parents always brushed it off. They'd say things like, she's not a baby anymore, or, you need to let her figure it out. My older brother Damien flat out called me Helicopter Nathan. Even Riley started rolling her eyes at me. At family dinners, they joke about how I treated her like glass, how I needed to get a life. It started getting worse around her junior year. She wanted to go to parties, sleep over at friends houses, do normal teenager stuff. And every single time, I'd ask the same questions. Does her friend's mom know about her diabetes? Does she have her emergency glucagon kit? Is her CGM charged? Riley would groan. Damien would laugh. My parents would give me this look like I was ruining her childhood. One night at dinner, my mom actually said, you know what your problem is? You act like her parent instead of her brother. We've got this handled. I looked at her. When's the last Time you checked her blood sugar at night, she went quiet. My dad changed the subject. That's when I knew they didn't actually wanna handle it. They just wanted me to handle it quietly without making them feel guilty about not being around. The breaking point came two weeks later. Riley wanted to go to some party at a guy's house across town. I asked her the usual questions. She exploded. Oh my God, Nathan, I'm not 5. I can take care of myself. Damien jumped in. Dude, seriously, you need therapy or something. This isn't normal. My dad sighed. Son, we appreciate everything you do, but Riley's growing up. You. You have to let her make her own choices. I sat there for a second. Then I said, alright, fine. I'm done. Riley looked confused. What, you want me to back off? I'm backing off completely. My mom laughed nervously. Nathan

Her ex husband Tyson needed help after surgery. She was moving in temporarily. Two months be 3. I stayed calm, of course. I said, when do you leave? Her relief was instant. Tomorrow. His surgery is Thursday morning. She claimed Tyson had no one else but I'd seen his Instagram, regular hangouts with friends, family, barbecues. Something didn't add up that night. While Sarah showered, I checked her laptop. She never locked it. At the top of her email was a thread with Tyson going back months.

He's too passive to make a scene. This is our second chance. Too passive. That's what six years of marriage had taught Her about me. Tyson wasn't having major surgery. It was a minor elective teacher. They've been planning this reunion for months, timing it around my busy work season. But here's what Sarah didn't know. I'm an accountant. I noticed $15,000 missing from our joint account over the past The money had gone to a down payment on a condo in both their names. Then I found something that made my blood run cold. Hidden in Sarah's cloud storage was a life insurance policy on me for $750,000 taken out eight months ago. Beneficiary Sarah, co. Beneficiary Tyson. The premium payments match those mystery charges. Sarah had brushed off his subscription renewals. It was taken out right after she reconnected with Tyson on social media. I sat there staring at the screen. Why would she need a policy this.

Always knew you'd fail. Didn't tell her about the patent. I sold for $167 Million. When she filed for divorce to upgrade, I agreed to everything. When she and her lawyer found out, months later, they were. I'm Tyler, 34, and I need to tell you about the day my marriage died and my real life began. I met Vanessa at a rooftop party in Portland. She was this sharp corporate lawyer who could walk into a room and own it. I was a software engineer who thought he had found his perfect match. Six months later, I proposed on that same rooftop. She said yes. The first few years were great. I LED a team at a tech company called Data Sync Solutions, making good money. Vanessa was climbing the ranks at her law firm. We bought a nice house in the suburbs, got a decent SUV. Live the dream. Then things changed. My company hit rough times. Bonuses got frozen. That's when I noticed Vanessa looking at me differently, like I was a stock that stopped performing. But here's what nobody knew. I had filed a patent years ago for an algorithm. I developed something that made data processing incredibly efficient. And during one meeting, leadership mentioned that employee owned patents could be sold independently if the company ever got acquired. I talked to my mentor, Patricia. She told me to stay quiet and wait. So I did. Meanwhile, Vanessa got promoted. Suddenly she was working late every night, coming home at 2:00am smelling like expensive Cologne that wasn't mine. Her best friend Candice kept posting photos of girls nights. Vanessa looked way too single. When I asked about it, she used what I called her lawyer voice. Cold, calculated, making me feel stupid for even questioning her. The criticism started getting brutal. Image is everything, Tyler. We can't live like this. Every conversation became a reminder of my failures. Then Data Sync got acquired. I got laid off with a Severance package. I came home early, and Vanessa laughed. She actually laughed.

We stood on the back porch, string lights casting shadows across the yard. He was quiet for a long moment. Can I ask you something? His voice was careful. Does she always treat you like that? I didn't know how to answer. My throat felt tight. He continued. Because I've watched her tonight. The way she talks over you, dismisses everything you say, makes these little comments that sound like jokes but aren't. He paused. And you just take it. Why? She's my sister. That's just how we are. That's not normal. His jaw was tight. I've been around your family for months now, and I'm just now realizing. She does this constantly, doesn't she? And everyone just lets it happen. I shrugged, trying to seem unbothered. It's fine. I'm used to it. That's the problem. He ran his hand through his hair. You shouldn't have to be used to it. Then he said the words that changed everything. I proposed to her, thinking she was kind, generous. The person she is when we're alone. His voice cracked slightly. But after tonight, after really watching how she treats you, I realized something. The person I thought I was marrying doesn't exist. She's performing, and when the performance drops, this is who she really is. He looked directly at me. You're exactly who I wish she was. Patient, genuine. Someone who Doesn't need to tear others down to feel important. My heart was pounding. Nathan, don't. I'm not saying this to make things weird. I'm saying it because I can't marry her. Not after seeing this. He pulled the engagement ring off his finger. I'm ending it tonight. She'll blame me. She'll blame everyone but herself. But that's not your problem anymore. He walked back inside minutes later, shouting, car doors, gravel! My sister called 37 times. Didn't answer. Three days later, she showed up at 2 a m, makeup smeared, shaking. You seduced him. You ruined my life. I looked at her and felt nothing. Good night, Claire. I closed the door. Six months later, I ran into Nathan at a coffee shop. He smiled. Still taking it? I smiled back.

There's 21 of us total eight parents 13 without kids she starts passing out printed memos with a fake smile plastered on her face. I'm excited to share some organizational changes effective November 1st I read the first line and my blood pressure spikes mandatory hours 8:00am to eight PM Monday through Sunday with weekends worked on an as needed basis I flip a page two exception team members with children will maintain standard 9:00am to five five PM hours Monday to Friday only she finishes her presentation. Any questions? My hand shoots up. Yeah, I have a question. In what world did you think this would be okay? She doesn't even flinch due to circumstances over the past few months team members with children have fallen behind on projects while managing childcare. We need to pick up up the slack to meet our quarterly targets I pulled up our project dashboard on my laptop turned the screen toward her based on yesterday's status meeting every single child free team member is on track most of us are finishing projects three to four days before deadline so you're telling me that those of us without kids have to work an additional 40 hours per week to complete Projects for people who won't even help finish those same projects. I'm struggling to understand why this is such a big issue for you. I looked around the table. Is anyone else okay with this? All eight of my child free teammates shook their heads. The parents stared at their memos in silence. This is absolutely insane, I said. You realize that, right? She just linked at me one more question. Will you also be working these hours with us? Long pause. No. I have a child. Your kid is 18 years old and in college. Ill. My child. I was ready to throw my laptop through the window. She just ended the meeting without another word. I immediately regrouped with my child free team in the break room. We were all furious. I sent her an email within 10 minutes. We are formally requesting a meeting with HR and the legal department to review our employment contracts and discuss the proposed mandatory hours were being required to work solely because we don't have children. My phone rang.

She said. You're not built for the rooms I walk into. She repeated that to everyone, her parents, her friends, even people at dinner parties. Three weeks later, divorce papers arrived. The reason listed was literally need and upgrade. She wanted the house, the car, everything, plus alimony to maintain her lifestyle. I didn't fight. I called my lawyer, Sonia. We structured everything carefully. I paid the full alimony up front for my Severance and included a clause saying neither of us could ever make financial claims against each other again no matter what happened in the future. Her lawyer actually warned her it was too restrictive. Vanessa signed anyway. She was that eager to get rid of me. Here's what she didn't know. Three days after signing those papers, companies started calling about my patent. Turns out my algorithm was revolutionary. My lawyer set up an LLC and a trust to protect everything. After six weeks of negotiations, this same company that fired me paid $167 million for my patent. But legally, I never personally received a penny. It all went into the trust structure. I. I moved into a tiny apartment above a bakery. I got a small team together and started building something real. I kept quiet, lived modestly and nobody knew. Then Vanessa's friend Candice noticed I wasn't acting broke enough. She started digging, posting passive aggressive Instagram stories. Two weeks later, Vanessa filed a motion claiming I had hidden assets and Defrauded her during the divorce. We went to court. Her fancy lawyer laid out this whole case about how I had concealed negotiations and tricked her into a bad settlement. My lawyer stood up and calmly destroyed every argument. The sale happened three months after our divorce was final. The patent had been filed in my name alone years before we had problems. And most importantly, Vanessa had signed a clause specific, specifically stating she could not claim any future money I made ever. The judge denied her motion immediately, then granted our counterclaim for frivolous litigation. Vanessa had to pay my legal fees. She called me 4 times after that. On the 4th call, I answered, I'm sorry. She said, can we talk, maybe meet up? I wish you well, Vanessa. I said, some bridges.

My dad finally got his boxers on and he's coming at me again, trying to grab my phone. I pushed him back hard and he fell into the dresser, knocked over all her perfume bottles, then hit the ground. Shaw shrieked his name like she was worried about him, like he was the one she cared about. I turned the camera back to her and said, how long, Shaw, how long have you been doing this in our bed? She's sobbing saying it only happened twice, I swear, just twice. I actually laughed. I was like, twice that I know about. How many times when I was at work, how many times when I drove three hours to see my mom on Sundays did he stay here? My father was trying to put his pants on, his hands shaking. He's saying, son, please, we need to talk about this like adults. We can work through this. I said, work through what, dad? You're sleeping with my girlfriend in my bed. The girlfriend you met at our family Christmas, the one mom loves, the one who calls you for advice. Shaw was Begging now, saying she loved me, that it was a mistake, that my dad had been helping her study and it just happened. I looked at my dad and said, does mom know? His face went white. I said, I'm sending this to her right now, to everyone. Shaw started screaming, no, please don't do that. Please, we can fix this. I was already pulling up my contacts. I sent the video to my mom, my brother, my sister, and then I opened Shaw's phone. She always used the same password, our anniversary date. And I sent the video to her entire family group chat, her mom, her dad, her two sisters, her aunts, everyone. I did all of this while they both watched frozen in our bedroom. My dad was saying, please don't do this. Think about the family. I said, I am thinking about the family. I'm thinking about mom, who's been married to you for 28 years. Then I walked out. I was halfway down the hallway when Shaw ran after me, wrapped in just the, she's grabbing my arm, begging me not to send it, saying she'd do anything. I pulled my arm away and said, you already did everything. I got in my car and sat there for maybe two minutes. My phone was blowing up. My mom calling, my brother calling, Shaw calling, my dad calling. Then Shaw's sister called, the one I'd always gotten along with at family dinners. I answer.

Last Thursday, I sold my gaming PC for $800 without telling her first. I've had that thing since college, built it myself sophomore year with my roommate, spent every penny from my summer job on it, but I barely touched it in the past two years, maybe turned it on twice. Meanwhile, our AC completely died during a 95 degree heat wave and the repair company quoted us $750. We had exactly $200 in our checking account and payday wasn't until next Friday, nine days away. I posted the PC on Facebook Marketplace at 9:00am with detailed spec and photos. By two PM, some college kid showed up at our door with 800 dollar cash, didn't even try to negotiate. I handed 750 dollars to the AC guy who was scheduled for three PM, kept 50 dollars for gas money and thought I was being responsible and smart. My wife got home from work at 6 and walk straight into my office like she always does. She froze in the doorway. Where's your computer? Did someone break in? I explained the whole situation, showed her the AC receipt on the counter, even pulled up the Facebook messages on my phone. She stared at the receipt for a solid 10 seconds. Then her face went red and she said, you sold something worth $800 without even texting me. That's a major financial decision. I tried explaining It was tech technically mine from before we got married. It was collecting dust and we desperately needed the AC fixed or we'd be sleeping in a sauna. She cut me off mid sentence. I don't care whose it was. Legally we're married now. You should have called me at lunch. I would have said yes, but you didn't even ask. And came the punishment, sleep on the couch tonight. I actually laughed out loud because I thought she was joking. We have a guest bedroom right across the hall with a full size bed that literally nobody uses except when her parents visit twice a year. Why would I fold my 6.2 frame onto our tiny uncomfortable couch when there's a perfectly good empty room 10 feet away? I.

I forgot paperwork for a 2 p m. Meeting, so I drove back during lunch without texting her. Shaw was studying for the LSAT and I didn't want to bother her. We've been together for six years, and I was planning to propose next month. I'd already looked at rings when I pulled into our apartment complex. I noticed a truck that looked exactly like my dad's in visitor parking. Same make, same color, even the same dent on the bumper from when he backed into our mailbox last Christmas. I figured maybe he stopped by to help with something. Shaw mentioned needing the bathroom sink fixed, and I kept putting it off between work and helping her study.

His work boots right there at the entrance. The steel toed Timberlands he wore to every job site. Then her yoga pants. The purple ones I got her for her birthday. Then his flannel shirt. Then her bra. My brain was trying to make sense of it. Like maybe they spilled something and had to change. Maybe there was a leak. I don't know what I was thinking. Then I heard them. The sounds coming from our bedroom. Sounds you never want to Hear. Especially when you recognize your own father's voice. I stood in the hallway, frozen for maybe 10 seconds. My hands were shaking. I pulled out my phone and started recording, because I knew if I didn't have proof, no one would believe me. My father, Clark. Respect. Father of two, grandfather of three. The guy who coached a Little League for 15 years. I walked down the hallway, recording the trail of clothes, the sounds getting louder. Our bedroom door was wide open, like they didn't even care.

That's when my mom, Uncle Dave's sister spoke up quietly. Patricia, is there something you need to tell Dave? Aunt Patricia's face crumbled. Not here, please. Not here. And where? Uncle Dave demanded. When after she mails this fake family tree to everyone we know, after we frame it and hang it in our living room. It was 32 years ago. Aunt Patricia suddenly shouted, I made a mistake. One mistake. The room exploded. Cousins gasping, grandma gripping the table. My uncle standing there like someone had hit him with a bat. Who? Uncle Dave's voice was barely a whisper and Patricia was sobbing. Now someone from work. It was one time I thought, I prayed it was yours. When she was born, I convinced myself she looked like you. I wanted her to be yours so badly that I just. 32 years, Uncle Dave repeated, you let me raise her for 32 years thinking she was mine. Brianna was frozen, binder still touched to her chest, tears streaming down her face but not making a sound. She is yours, Aunt Patricia beg. You raised her. You're her father in every way that matters. DNA doesn't change that. Get out. The roar came from my grandmother, tiny 82 year old grandma who never raised her voice, standing up and pointing at Aunt Patricia. Get out of this family reunion. You don't Get to lie to my son for three decades and then tell him B and a doesn't matter. Aunt Patricia look around the room desperately looking for one sympathetic face, found none. Uncle Dave walked out without another word, just grabbed his keys and left. Brianna dropped the bomb and the three ring mechanism broke. Papers scattering everywhere. Her entire identity, her life's work literally falling apart at her feet. She looked at me with pure hatred. You couldn't have told me privately you were about to publish this and send it to everyone in the family. Would you you rather find out now or after it's in print? You destroyed everything, she whispered. My mom tried to reach for her, but Brianna yanked away and ran out. That left Aunt Patricia standing alone in the center of the room, mascara running, 50 relatives staring at her like she was a stranger. My cousin Trevor, Brianna's younger brother spoke up from the corner. His voice was shaking and my dad's. Rest of the story is linked below and on my channel.

She was building a case. Every ethic kid who brought non American food was going in that journal. Here's what Missus Fisher didn't know. My dad owned Kowalski's European Deli, the only authentic imported food store within 30 miles. We've been there since before I was born. Half the town bought their specialty items from us. That Saturday, Missus Fisher walked into our store. She didn't recognise me behind the counter in my work apron and comfy hat. I recognised her immediately. She browsed the cases, pointing at items. I need a pound of that filbasa, some of those potato pancakes and that sour kraut in the back. Oh, and do you have any fresh broggy? I kept my voice steady. The mushroom or the potato and cheese? Both. A dozen of each. I packaged everything carefully, watching her examine our family photos on the wall. Four generations of Walshes running this store. She studied my great grandmother's picture, the woman who'd brought these recipes from Poland. My dad came out from the back and started ringing her up. That's when I stepped forward and handed her the itemized receipt. Will you be eating this in America, missus Fisher, or should I label it as contamination? Her face drained of color. My dad looked confused until I continued. These are the exact foods you made me eat outside in the cold. You called them contaminating, said they Weren't American enough for your classroom, Miss? Missus Fisher stammered. I didn't mean, this is different. Different how? My dad's voice went cold. He was looking at her the way he looked at people who disrespected our heritage. My mother made that sauerkraut recipe. My grandmother made those pierogi. Four generations. Missus Fisher, you're about to pay $47 for contamination. She reached for her wallet, hands shaking, but my dad held up his hand. Actually, I don't think we.

We were sorting through old photos at Grandma's house when I noticed something weird. Aunt Lisa appeared in every family picture after 1999, but before that, nothing. Not a single photo. I thought maybe she was just camera shy or something, so I asked her about it during dinner. Aunt Lisa, how come you're not in any photos before 1999? Entire table went silent. My mom's fork dropped. Dad's face went white. Grandma stood up and left the room. Aunt Lisa's expression changed completely. She walked over to me, grabbed my arm and said, we don't talk about that. But I was 15 and curious. Was it because of witness Protection? Were you in jail? Did you? That's when she slapped me hard. So hard that I fell backward, hit my head on the corner of the dining table, and everything went black. I woke up in the hospital with six stitches and mom crying next to my bed. Dad was on the phone with a lawyer. My head was pounding and I could barely remember what happened. Mom held my hand and said, I'm so sorry, sweetheart. I should have told you years ago. That's when she explained everything. Aunt Lisa wasn't actually born until 1998. She was adopted as a teenager after my grandma's actual daughter, also named Lisa, died in a car accident. In 1997. But here's where it gets darker. The original Lisa, my mom's younger sister, didn't just die in any car accident. She was driving home from prom with her boyfriend when their car was hit by a drunk driver. The boyfriend died instantly. Lisa survived for three days in the I C U. Before her organs failed. Grandma was so devastated that she couldn't function. She stopped eating, stopped talking, just sat in Lisa's bedroom.

She started getting smarter about it, too. She'd wait until I was doing laundry or on a work call. Sometimes she'd take one to school in her lunch box. Even though I packed her a Capri Sun, I'd find the empty Capri Sun in her backpack later, still sealed. Made me want to laugh every time. After about a month, I noticed she had more energy. She wasn't falling asleep at the kitchen table after school anymore. Her skin looked better, too, not as pale. Her teacher sent an email saying she was participating more in class. I knew it was working, but I couldn't tell her the truth. The second she found out those juice boxes were healthy, she'd stop drinking them. So I kept up the act. I'd shake my head when I'd see empty boxes in the recycling. I'd say things like, you're going through these too fast, while secretly buying two packs instead of one. Then I got bold with the food. She loved my spaghetti sauce but only ate the noodles with butter at other people's houses. One night I blended up carrots, zucchini and tomatoes and stirred it into the sauce, cooked it down for like two hours so it got really thick. She ate three bowls that night, said it was the best sauce I'd ever made. I started doing it with everything. Sloppy Joe's got blended peppers and onions. Meatloaf got shredded zucchini. I made a Huge batch of each every Sunday and put them in containers so she could microwave them for lunch. During the week, she'd come home from school and tell me about how the other kids were jealous of her food. Last month, she asked me why my spaghetti sauce was so much better than in the jar stuff her friend's mom uses. I told her it was because I added extra tomato paste and let it cook longer. She believed me, went right back to eating. The juice box thing almost got exposed. Two weeks ago, we were at target and she saw them on sale. She grabbed my arm and pointed at the display all excited. I looked at the label with her standing right there. She was reading the front that said Fruit Punch in big letters. I made sure she didn't flip it around to see the back where it listed all the vegetables. I told her the sale wasn't that good and we'd just get them at our regular store.

She told me I had a strong defamation case if I could prove Ashley was lying. We started gathering evidence. Mike gave a written statement that I stayed at his place the night of the party. We had time stamps for my Uber rides showing I went straight from the party to Mike's apartment. My credit card showed I bought breakfast near Mike's house the next morning. There was no gap in the timeline where I could have been with Ashley. Patricia requested Ashley's medical records through legal discovery. Ashley fought it hard, but the judge ordered her to comply. Turns out Ashley wasn't even pregnant. She'd never taken a pregnancy test, never saw a doctor. The whole thing was completely made up. Patricia also found Ashley's search history from the week before she accused me. She'd been googling things like how to break up a family and can you go to jail for false accusations. We took all of this to court in September, filed a defamation lawsuit asking for damages. Ashley showed up with some cheap lawyer who clearly wasn't prepared. He presented everything, the timeline, the medical records, the search history, Mike's statement. Ashley's lawyer tried arguing that she was confused and made an honest mistake, you can't accidentally make up an entire pregnancy and assault story. The judge wasn't buying it. During her testimony, Ashley completely fell apart on the stand, started changing her story, contradicting herself, finally admitted she made Everything up because she'd actually cheated on Derek with his coworker and needed a cover story. He thought if she could make me look like the bad guy, nobody would question her. When she eventually claimed Derek wasn't the father, the courtroom went silent. Derek was sitting in the back and I watched his face go completely white. My parents were there, too, and my mom started crying. The judge ruled in my favor, ordered Ashley to pay me $50,000 in damages plus my legal fees, also issued a restraining order. Ashley and Derek broke up that same day. He called off the wedding and kicked her out of his apartment. Two weeks later, Derek showed up at my door. He looked terrible, like he hadn't slept in days, started apologizing and saying he should have believed me, that he was sorry for hitting me and cutting me off. My parents sent letters, too, saying they made a horrible mistake and wanted to rebuild our relationship. Part of me wanted to forgive them immediately because they're my family. But another part of me was still furious. They believed a lie without even hearing my side. They abandoned me when I needed them most. Derek, standing in my doorway now, asking if we can grab coffee and talk, says he'll do whatever it takes to make this right. I honestly don't know what to do.

I hired a lawyer. Jennifer reviewed everything and smiled with steel in her eyes. Your mother doesn't have a case. If she pursues this, we'll counter sue for financial abuse. We'll expose every transfer, every guilt trip, every manipulative text. We'll make this so ugly she'll wish she never picked up the phone. Two weeks before the wedding, the mortgage payment bounced. My credit dropped 30 points. The Tesla payment bounced. Next day, another hit. Then Jennifer discovered something. My mother had been making minimum payments with my money while telling relatives she was supporting her ungrateful daughter through hard times. She, I've been using my financial abuse to play the martyr. My mother's lawyer withdrew from the case after realizing she'd been lying to him. My father called. Where did all the money go, dad, I asked. I paid $150,000. Where is it? Silence. Your mother has expectations, he finally said, about how we should live. The trips, the furniture, the club memberships. She says, we've earned it. You could start by making your own payments, I said softly. You could start by being my dad. Instead of her accomplice, he hung up. My mother showed up at my bridal shower disheveled and desperate. Please, she begged in front of everyone. We need to talk. You need to leave, I said. When she wouldn't, Emily called the police. The wedding was perfect. My mother didn't. Come neither did my father. Their absence felt like the first honest thing they'd given me in years. Three months later, Jennifer emailed, your parents house went into foreclosure. The Tesla was repossessed. Your mother attempted to open a credit card in your name. I filed identity theft reports. Six months later, my father called from Nevada. I left. I'm divorcing her. I wanted to say I'm sorry, not just for the money, for not being your dad. A year after the wedding, I saw my mother at the grocery store. She looked like someone who'd been surviving instead of living. I'm sorry, she said. You were right about everything. I destroyed the best thing in my life because I couldn't stand not being the center of your world. I can't be part of your healing journey. I replied, not right now, maybe not ever. She nodded. You look happy. That's all I ever should have wanted for you. My credit recovered. John and I bought our own house. My father and I talk once a month, brief, honest conversations. My mother stood up at my rehearsal dinner and tried to destroy. Instead, she freed me and I've never looked back.

And when I read the submission, my girlfriend text me constantly and gets upset if I hang out with friends. I knew immediately it was about me. I sat in the back of study hall with my coffee opening submissions for The Truth Oath, the anonymous advice column I've been running for two years. Most were the usual stuff. My crush doesn't know I exist. My ex won't stop texting me. Easy problems with easy answers. I was good at this, better at fixing other people's relationships than my own. Owen and I had been together for eight months, but ever since my parents announced their divorce, I've been a mess, texting him constantly, getting anxious when he didn't respond. I even made him leave Jake's party last Friday because I was upset. I knew I was being too much. Owen had been patient, but lately he'd been distant. I clicked on the next submission. How do I tell my girlfriend she's suffocating me? My coffee cup stopped halfway to my lips. The submission sat in my drafts folder all week. I had to respond to it. It was my job. But how could I be objective about my own relationship? I started writing Monday night. It sounds like your girlfriend might be dealing with anxiety or stress. Before you end things, try talking to her honestly about how you feel. I published it Tuesday morning. By lunch, three people. Had commented online saying the advice was too soft. He should just dump her. One comment read, she sounds crazy. I deleted the comments, but the words stayed in my head. Was I crazy? Wednesday, oh asked if I wanted to study together after school. I said yes, desperate to act normal. But the whole time I was watching him for signs. Signs he was planning to break up with me. Signs he was just going through the motions. You okay? He asked at one point. You keep staring at me. I'm fine. But I wasn't fine. Thursday, I saw him talking to Ben by the gym. Ben showed Owen something on his phone and Owen shook his head, looking stressed. When Owen saw me watching, Ben put his phone away quickly. Hey, Owen said, walking over. What were you and Ben looking at? Nothing, just some video. He was lying, I could tell. That night I couldn't focus on anything. I kept refreshing the submission page to see if the person had responded to my advice. They.

She picked the wrong man. My fiance and I exchanged glances. I replied, perfect and got security to kick her out. The same night, she texted, don't forget the mortgage payment and the Tesla car loan payments are tomorrow. I stared at that text until my hands stopped shaking. On read over my shoulder, what mortgage? What Tesla? That's when six years of lies came pouring out. When I was 22, my mother called, crying dad made bad investments. They'd lose the house. Could I help? Just temporarily? I co signed a 60 thousand dollar mortgage refinance. Six months later, I co signed a 55 thousand dollar Tesla loan. Because he deserves something nice. I promised to make every payment. I'd never see a Bill except the backup. Automatic transfers from my account became the primary. $700 monthly for the mortgage, $800 for the Tesla, plus insurance, taxes, emergencies. Nearly $2,000 vanishing every month for six years. $150,000 of my money gone. I've been packing lunches and skipping trips, thinking I was saving for our wedding, but I was barely breaking even. Drowning while my mother pushed me under inch by inch. When I felt stressed about money, she'd say, you make good money, you're just bad with budgeting. She gaslit me into thinking I was the problem. John asked what I wanted to do. I logged into my bank and deleted every Automatic payment authorization. Then I screenshot the confirmation and sent it to my mother with one message. You said you weren't paying for the circus. I'm not paying for your life anymore. I blocked her number, turned off my phone, let John hold me while I shook apart. The next morning brought 17 missed calls on John's phone. My mother's friends, my aunts, cousins. The family network activated with one message. I was selfish, ungrateful. Destroying my family over one little disagreement. She'd recruited everyone to tell me so. Then my mother's lawyer sent a letter threatening to sue me for emotional distress and financial damage caused by my unwanted withdrawal of support.

I'd grown it out for three years specifically for the wedding. Rachel knew this. She'd been there through every trim, every deep conditioning treatment, every moment. I said no to a fun new cut because I wanted that long, romantic updo for my wedding day. She was supposed to protect me at the salon. That's why she came along instead. When I closed my eyes for the wash, she slipped the stylist $300 cash and whispered new instructions, cut it short, Pixie short. Say it was a miscommunication. The stylist took the money. When I opened my eyes, two feet of hair covered the floor and Rachel was fake gasping, hand over her mouth, playing shocked. The stylist kept apologizing, saying she thought I said I wanted a dramatic change, that I was tired of the length. I sobbed for two hours. Rachel held me, rubbed my back, said maybe it was meant to be that I'd look edgy and modern now. He offered to pay for extensions, but we both knew they'd never look right. With only six days to blend them properly that night, I couldn't stop thinking about Rachel's reaction. Too perfect, too rehearsed. The stylist had cut with such confidence, no hesitation, no checking in like they usually do with big changes. I called the salon the next morning, asked to speak to the manager, told her I suspected something happened. But needed to know for sure. She reviewed the security footage, called me back within an hour. Your friend handed our stylist money while you were at the wash station. We have it on camera. The audio is muffled, but you can see the cash exchange clearly. She offered to fire the stylist, offered free services for a year. I said no. Just emailed me the footage. I watched it 20 times. Rachel's smug little smile as she handed over the bills. The stylist nodding eagerly. Rachel checking to make sure I still had my eyes closed. I didn't confront her, not yet. Instead, I called James, told him everything. He was furious, but I asked him to wait. Let me handle this my way. Four days before the wedding, Rachel threw my bachelorette party, 15 women at a wine bar she booked. During her toast, she went on about our 12 year friendship, how she'd always been there for me.

For six years straight, I showed up to every single one of my nephew's birthday parties with wrapped presents. Noah turned seven, I brought him that expensive robot kit he wanted. Jacob turned five, I got him the Dinosaur set from the fancy toy store. Every year, twice a year, I'd spend at least 40 bucks per kid and drive 30 minutes to their house. My kids are eight and 6 now, and in all those years, not once did my brother Keith or his wife bring anything to my kids parties. Not a card, not a five dollar toy from the discount store, nothing. They'd show up, eat the cake, let their kids play, then leave. Last year was the worst. My daughter turned seven and specifically asked if Noah and Jacob were coming because she wanted to show them her new bike. Texted Keith three times confirming they'd be there. They came two hours late, stayed for 15 minutes, and left without even singing Happy Birthday. My daughter kept asking where they went. Two months later, Noah's eighth birthday invitation arrived in the mail. One of those fancy printed ones with the superhero theme. My husband saw me looking at it and said, you're not actually going to buy another present, right? I thought about it for three days. I looked at my Amazon order history and counted 12 birthday gifts I'd bought. For my nephews over the years. Then I checked my kids birthday photos. Keith's family wasn't in a single one from the last three years. I decided we'd still go to the party, but I walked in empty handed. My mom was already there and immediately pulled me aside. Where's Noah's gift? She whispered. I didn't bring one. Her face went red. What do you mean you didn't bring one? Everyone brings gifts to birthday parties. Keith never brings gifts to my kids parties, I said. She started talking about how that's different, how I'm being petty, how it's not the kid's fault. But I just walked away and sat down at one of the tables. Keith's wife noticed right away. She kept staring at me during the cake cutting. Probably looking for a gift bag that wasn't there. After the party, my phone blew up. Keith texted me saying I embarrassed.

We found out I was pregnant in September. My husband Jake and I were so excited. We told both our families the same day. His sister Danny was dating some guy she'd met through a family friend and got engaged in October after knowing him for three months. My in laws were thrilled because Danny had been complaining about wanting to get married for five years straight. At the engagement party, Danny mentioned she wanted the wedding by April 2,025. Jake told his parents right there that my doctor said I couldn't travel after 34 weeks. His mom just nodded and changed the subject. They picked April 19th anyway. The wedding would be in Texas, where Danny's fiance lived. That's a three and a half hour flight from US. I told Jake in February that I'd be 37 weeks pregnant by then and couldn't go. His mom called him and said it was fine if I stayed home, but he had to come. I actually said okay at first because I figured it would be fine. Then we had an OB appointment two weeks ago. I asked the doctor directly if Jake could travel during my 37th week. She looked at both of us and said, absolutely not. She said it would be like rolling dice, and if I went into labor, she couldn't stop it. Jake agreed right there that it was messed up. They picked that date knowing we probably Couldn't make it. Last week, Jake told his mom we both weren't coming. She lost it. His dad called and said if Jake didn't show up, then he wouldn't go either. Like that was supposed to guilt us into changing our minds. Looked at me after the call and asked if maybe he could just go for the ceremony and fly back the same day. I said no. He asked if his parents could stay with me while he went. I said no again. He tried saying his sister would never forgive him. I reminded him that Danny knew my due date when she picked April 19th. She knew I'd be two weeks away from giving birth. His whole family knew. They just didn't care. His mom started texting me directly.

I simply said, handle it yourself. Now they're calling me in a panic. I spent 10 years building my parents jewelry shop from barely breaking even to consistent profit. My sister Vivian spent those years bouncing between marketing internships and travel blogging. Last month, they signed the business over to her without telling me. I started at 19, learning to size rings, clean settings, spot fake stones. Dad taught me supplier negotiations. Mom, mom showed me the books. By year 3, I'd expanded our repair services and built relationships with three estate sale companies who'd call me first when quality pieces came in. Year 5, I created a wedding package engagement ring plus bands that became our biggest revenue stream. Year 7, I convinced old Mister Wang, a master jeweler, to come out of retirement part time for our custom work. Vivian visited maybe twice a year. She'd try on pieces for photos, post them with our location tagged, then leave. She had a marketing degree from a decent school but never used it. Meanwhile, I worked six days a week, handled everything from inventory to customer consultations to quarterly tax prep. Three weeks ago, mom asked me to come in early. Your father and I want to retire. Moved to Arizona near your aunt. For a second, I thought this was it. 10 years of work finally recognized we're transferring ownership to Vivian.

You'll stay on. His manager. Same job. Really? Dad was standing behind her, arms crossed. We've already filed the paperwork. Legal costs were expensive. This is happening. I looked between them. When two weeks. I nodded slowly and left without another word. That weekend, I reviewed what I built. The supplier contacts were in my phone, not the shop database. The estate sale coordinators had my personal cell. Mister Wang worked for me specifically on a handshake agreement. Customer database with anniversary reminders and preference notes existed in a spreadsheet on my laptop. The social media accounts were under my personal email. None of it transferred with the deed. Monday, Vivian showed up with a three ring binder. She'd made a presentation about modernizing the brand. Younger demographic, Instagram focus, trendy, minimal.

What? Well, someone needs to watch Rusty, she said, gesturing to their elderly golden retriever sleeping in the corner. You don't mind, right? You're already here. The room had gone back to chattering about the vacation. No one was looking at us. No one cared. Wait. You begged me to drive six hours so I could dog sit? Don't be dramatic. It's not just dog sitting. You'll have the whole house to yourself. You can relax, catch up on sleep. You always say you need a break. My sister walked by, suitcase already in hand. Thanks for doing this, she said without stopping. I was worried we'd have to cancel. That's when it clicked. This was planned. They'd coordinated this whole thing. Get me here under the pretense of a reunion, then drop the dog sitting bomb once I'd already made the trip. How long is the vacation? I asked quietly. Just 10 days, mom said. Rusty's on medication. Three times a day, schedules on the fridge. Oh, and he needs his special food. Don't give him table scraps. 10 days? They wanted me to drop everything for 10 days. I have work, I said. You work remotely. She chirped. See? Perfect solution. I looked around the room at my family, all excited about their vacation, none of them considering that maybe, just maybe, this was wildly disrespectful. My dad was already loading suitcases into the car. I walked over to Rusty and sat down next to him. He Opened one eye, gave a half hearted tail wag, then went back to sleep. Sweet dog. Didn't deserve to be used as bait. I stood up, grabbed my keys, and headed for the door. Where are you going? Mom called home. But what about Rusty? I turned around. I'm sure one of the family members going on the family vacation can stay behind and take care of him. Or you could board him. Or here's an idea. You could have asked me to dog sit instead of manipulating me into driving six hours. You're being ridiculous. My dad said, have a great trip. I replied. I made it to my car before my phone started buzzing. Texts, calls, voicemails. How could I do this? I was ruining everything. I was being selfish. I blocked them all, started the engine, and drove home. Six hours back. But this time, I was smiling. Rusty's fine, by the way. They canceled the vacation.

To Lia and Noah. My handwriting. Neat, deliberate. Inside a crystal frame. And underneath, printed screenshots. Text messages from three weeks ago when I'd run into her coworker over coffee. He's so sweet, but naive. A few fake tears and he buys whatever I want. His mom suspects nothing. The prenup was almost too easy. By Christmas, the house is mine. He won't even see it coming. Not a threat. Just truth. I walked to my car, started the engine. Through the rearview mirror, I watched the glowing windows. The music pulsed faintly through the walls. Fifteen minutes later, the scream cut through the Vermont night. They opened it during the gift display. Leia tugged the ribbon, lifted the lid. Her hand froze. Noah leaned over, read the first line. The second, his face drained. What is this? He whispered. It's fake. Laya hissed. Someone's trying to. But his mother, Victoria, was already crossing the floor. These were forwarded to me this morning. From a stylist you hired. Wrong thread. Noah turned the pages, his jaw tight. The dates match. This is real. The music thinned. The violinist missed an entire beat. Laya's voice cracked. No, you don't understand. My sister Ashlyn did this. She's jealous. She's always. Stop! Noah's voice cut like a whip. You did this. You humiliated her today and thought no one would see who you really are. Every face turned. The DJ lowered the music. A child asked, mom, what's happening? Noah pulled a folded document from his jacket, set it on the table. This is an annulment petition. I already signed it. The crystal frame hit the floor, shattered. Laya's scream echoed across the water. Mom reached for her arm. Sweetheart, maybe we should step outside. Don't touch me! Laya cried. You all wanted this. Dad spoke quietly for the first time that night. You should apologize to your sister. Laya laughed, a sound so brittle it didn't reach her eyes. Apologize to her? She's not even family. Dad shook his head slowly. That's where you're wrong. By the time I got home, my phone had 26 missed calls. Mom, Dad, Lia's bridesmaids, even Noah's mother. I didn't check any of them. I hung my wine colored dress on a chair and stared at it. Still perfect, still untouched. Just like the lie I'd carried for years. That being invisible meant being worthless. Today they're all calling, and I'm the one who gets to ignore them.

Dad had lost $200,000 in a crypto scam. They'd refinanced, missed payments, received pre foreclosure warnings. They had four months before foreclosure. The offer wasn't generosity. It was desperation. I bought it through an LLC for $440,000, all cash. I never knew it was me until Mom's 60th birthday dinner. I showed up with an envelope. Halfway through dinner, Uncle Roger started toasts. When it got to me, I stood up. this past year taught me what I'm willing to accept and what I'm not. Sometimes the best gift isn't what people want, it's what they need. I pulled out an envelope, set it in front of her. What's this? Open it. She pulled out the papers. Her face went white. As some of you know, mom and dad were in pre foreclosure. Their house sold six weeks ago to an LLC. Quick close, all cash below market value. Dad's face went red. Mom's hands shook. What they didn't know is that I bought it. I was the LLC. I bought their house for $440,000. Mom gasped. And I've spent six weeks converting it into the Opportunity Fund, a foundation supporting entrepreneurs who've been underestimated, people who took unconventional paths and were told they'd never amount to anything. I looked at dad. The house where I grew up being called a parasite is now going to help other people who've been called the same thing. It's an incubator. Everything I didn't have when I needed it, you Can't do this, dad yelled. You can't just take our house. I didn't take it. I bought it after you defaulted because you invested your retirement in a crypto scam. The room exploded. I raised my voice. You have two weeks to vacate. I've arranged movers. I'll cover costs. I found you a rental you can actually afford. You're kicking us out, mom said. I'm helping you move into something sustainable. That's more than you did for me. Dad lunged toward me, but Paul stopped him. You're not part of this family anymore, dad said. I picked up my glass, took a final sip. I haven't been part of this family for a long time. The foundation opens in two weeks. Entrepreneurs move in March 15th, same day you move out. I looked at Cassie. I'm sorry it had to be like this. Then I walked out. Two weeks later, six entrepreneurs moved into that house. The house where my dreams almost died became the place where theirs came alive.

So my husband Devin has this 13 year old daughter from his first marriage and she's basically been the perfect kid the entire time I've known her. Like I'm not even exaggerating. She does her homework without being asked into her room, helps with dinner. I have a 10 year old from my previous relationship and she's great too. But his daughter never gave us a single problem, not one detention, not one bad grade, nothing. Until last Tuesday. I got a call from the school saying there was an incident and both parents needed to come in. Devin and I show up and the principal tells us his daughter got into it with another girl in her class. Apparently this other kid made some comment about me being a lesbian, which I'm not, but whatever. Middle school rumors are stupid. Devon's daughter fired back by making fun of the other girl's mom for being poor. The thing is the other family isn't even poor. The mom works at the grocery store and the dad does construction. They're just normal people. But his daughter said something about the girl wearing the same shoes all year and having off brand lunch snacks. Real mean stuff that 13 year olds say when they're mad. The other girl's parents grounded her for three weeks. No phone, no TV, no hanging out with Friends seemed fair to me, Devon decided his daughter's punishment needed to match what she did. He wanted her to feel what it's like to be poor, in his words. His actual plan was to make her go to school for three days without showering, without deodorant, without brushing her teeth and wearing the same dirty clothes. He said it would teach her empathy and make her understand what she mocked. I looked at him like he'd lost his mind. I told him that was humiliating and cruel and would probably traumatize her way more than teach her anything. His daughter was already crying and apologizing. She wrote an apology letter to the other girl without even being asked. Devon wouldn't budge. He kept saying the punishment had to fit the crime and that his daughter needed to learn actions have consequences. Said, yeah, consequences like losing her phone or being grounded or writing a real apology, not being forced to go to school smelling like garbage so other kids can bully her. We argued about it for two hours that night. His daughter was in her room sobbing. My daughter was scared because she'd never heard us fight like that. I finally told him if he went through with it, I would pack our stuff and file for divorce. Wasn't bluffing. He stared at me for a long time and then said I was being dramatic and undermining his parenting. I said his parenting was about to give His kid lifelong issues and turn her into a target for bullying, which would make everything worse. The whole point was to teach her not to mock people. And his solution was to put her in a position where everyone would mock her the next morning. He didn't make her do it. She showered, got dressed normal and went to school. She's grounded for 2 weeks, no phone, no sleepovers. And she had to meet with the school counselor and apologize in person to the other girl, which she did. Devon's been cold to me ever since. He thinks I threatened divorce.

I was chilling on my bed with my roommate when I got a Snapchat ad from Quick Add. His name was Connor and I was bored. So I added him back because why not? In our first convo, he was super chill and talked about normal stuff, relationships, family drama, stuff like that. That's when he asked how old I was. My roommate Audrey grabbed my phone and started typing for me, oh, I'm actually 15. How old are you? And I, I was dying laughing because at the time I was really 21. But when we saw his response, our laughter died in our throats. He said, oh, wow, that's young. I'm 28, but I hope we can keep talking. You seem really mature and I'm sure you're really cute. Lol heart emoji. Me and Audrey just stared at each other. Was this man for real? He was using all the classic signs of grooming, not even trying to hide it.

Then one night after we've been playing those stupid Snapchat games for like 3 hours straight. He sent me something that changed everything. One hundred dollars, the message said, for being so sweet and making my nights less lonely. I stared at my phone screen and screenshot it for Audrey. A hundred dollars for literally just sending Snapchats back and forth. Audrey replied saying, look him dry. The moral part of my brain was screaming at me saying this wasn't the right thing to do. But the other side of me, the broke college student who didn't want to work at the campus coffee shop anymore wanted more from him. That's when Connor sent something else that made my skin crawl.

Claudia appeared from nowhere. Absolutely not. The trust requires full immersion. Greta was explicit. Eight years German only, no exceptions. Let me see the actual trust document, my husband said. Bernie has the only copy, but I know what it says and call Werner right now. Her face went red. How dare you question me about our family's heritage? We started planning in secret. My husband called Uncle Werner directly, got the actual trust language, emailed. We documented everything. The development specialist concerns, the research papers, Claudius threatening letters to my family. 36 weeks, my placenta detached. My husband drove while I bled through towels. Claudia followed in her car, laying on the horn. I had an emergency C section. They put me under. I woke up foggy and wrong. My husband sat there looking murderous. What happened? Your mother went to NICU, told every nurse that English is forbidden around our daughter. She brought Verner's seat and disclist letters for hospital staff. She what she told them, any medical professional who speaks English near the baby will be sued by the family. Claudia appeared triumphant. I was protecting her language development. The first hours are critical. You threatened our daughter's medical team, he said through his teeth. Greta and Verner are driving down with The trust paperwork. They'll explain why this is legally binding. My monitor started screaming. My husband stood up. No, we're done. Our daughter will speak English or German or Smurf. I don't care. Whatever is healthy. The trust. I don't care about your trust. She lunged for him but security was already there. They've been called the moment she started harassing the NICU staff. Ma'am, you're banned from this floor, the guard said. That's my grandchild. Burner and Aunt Greta arrived together. Burner looked exhausted. Greta looked homicidal. Someone explain why I'm getting calls about hospital threats. Greta said Claudia rushed her. They were refusing the eight year protocol. Speaking English to the baby. The trust specifies. What protocol? Burner pulled out the actual trust document. There's no eight year protocol. You drafted it German only until eight quarter million for college. Burner stared at her. The trust says will contribute to college for descendants who value German heritage. It says nothing about language isolation. But you told me. I told you it would be nice if the kids Learned German. Nothing more. Greta stepped forward. Let me get this straight. You've been terrorizing them with a fake legal requirement. Claudia's voice broke. I was preserving what our grandmother built. Our grandmother would be horrified. Bernard said flatly. You're a control freak. This is why your son's don't talk to you, why your husband had an affair. You don't let people live how they want to.

I'm just trying to help you. Ryan's dad nodded. You'd feel so much better. That's when Ryan's mom put down her fork and reached across the table to grab my hand. Sweetie, have you thought about weight loss surgery? Honestly, it would change everything for you. The entire table went silent. Even her friends looked uncomfortable. I stood up and my chair made a loud scraping noise. You want to talk about bodies? My voice shook, but it was loud. Let's talk about yours. Ryan's mom blinked. Excuse me? Your face, I said. All that plastic surgery makes you look like you're wearing a mask. Your lips are so big you can barely close your mouth. And you look surprised all the time because you can't even move your forehead anymore. She gasped. I turned to Ryan's dad. And you. You sit there judging what I eat when you breathe like you just ran a race. Every time you stand up, your stomach hangs over your belt. His face turned bright red. Ryan's sister tried to say something, but I cut her off. You post photos without me because you think you look better alone. But you dress like you're still in your 20s when you're almost 40. Everyone talks about How desperate you look. Ryan's mom had tears running down her face. His sister looked like she might throw up. His dad was gripping his fork so hard his knuckles were white. I have been nothing but kind to you for three years while you picked apart every single thing about me. I said every meal, every photo, every comment, pretending to be concerned. You made me hate myself. You made me scared to eat. You made me feel worthless. And I'm done. Ryan stood up next to me. For a second, I thought he'd apologize for me. Instead, he looked at his mom and said, she's right. You've been cruel to her since day one. And I let it happen be cause I didn't want to fight with you. That makes me just as bad. But I'm done now. We're leaving and we're not coming back. His mom started crying hard. Ryan, we were just helping her. No, you were being bullies. He said, don't contact us. We're done. He grabbed my hand and we walked out in the car. Ryan apologized over and over. He said he should have protected me years ago. Do you agree with them about my weight? I asked. He hesitated for just a second too long before saying no. Which told me everything I needed to know. I dumped him.

The first time Ryan took me to meet his parents, his mom answered the door in an expensive looking sweat suit. She looked me up and down for a solid five seconds before stepping aside. Dinner was grilled salmon with vegetables and some grain I'd never heard of. Everything was measured out perfectly, like we were at a fancy restaurant. I reached for seconds and Ryan's mom touched my wrist. Oh, honey, maybe save room for dessert, she said sweetly. There was no dessert. Ryan squeezed my knee under the table but didn't say anything. His dad kept eating like nothing was wrong. When I got in the car, I told Ryan his mom was rude. He said, she's just like that with everyone. Don't take it personally. I should have ended things right there, but I didn't because I loved him. The comments got worse at every gathering. At our engagement party, Ryan's mom pulled me into the bathroom. We should go dress shopping together, she said. I know all the styles that hide problem areas. At Easter, his dad watched me take a second roll and announced to the table, someone's really enjoying the carbs today. His mom laughed and said, well, she's always had a big appetite. At Christmas, everyone opened their gifts, and I got a gym membership with a note that said, can't wait to See the new you. Ryan's sister posted family photos from that day and left me out of every single one. When I asked why, she. I figured you wouldn't want these online right now. Ryan kept telling me they meant well, and I was overreacting. At Thanksgiving, his mom brought out pie and gave everyone huge slices except to me. She sat down a tiny piece in front of me and whispered, just watching out for you, sweetie. His dad made a joke about the couch sinking on my side, and everyone laughed. I stopped eating before family dinners. My stomach would be in knots for days. I lost 20 pounds from the stress, and Ryan said, see, my mom's advice is actually helping. I wanted to scream. The breaking point was Ryan's mom's birthday dinner last month. The whole family was there, plus some of their friends. His mom was talking about her new trainer when

My family spent 30 years treating me like I couldn't cut it because I chose welding over Wall Street. Five years ago, I married. A lease under the oak tree on my grandmother's land. Hay bales for seats, wildflowers, barbecue. My crew wore work boots. Perfect. My family treated it like community service. Dad checked his watch constantly. My sister Bianca and husband Reid dressed for a Forbes Gala. Then came Reid's speech. When Bianca told me her brother was getting married, I thought she was joking. I figured his one true relationship was with his welding torch. His buddies laughed. Some of us were born to build empires. Society needs both, right? Someone's got to make the fixtures. Bianca added, I could never give up my spa appointments, but I admire your commitment to simplicity. What they didn't know. For six years, I've been developing a chemical coating for metal. Make steel stronger, rust proof, safe. After four years of failures, I cracked it, filed four patents, started an LLC, kept it quiet while Reid bought a mansion and Bianca turned influencer. My company hit $3.8 million, then $8.2 million. We still drove our old trucks. Nothing changed outside. Reid, meanwhile, quit his corporate job to start a hedge fund. Made aggressive plays. Dad talked about him like he'd invented capitalism. One night, Reid cornered me at their housewarming. Good for you, man. Honest work. Someone's gotta make the stuff we put in our offices. And my cousin called. Reid's in serious trouble. Lost everything. His clients money. There's talk of fraud charges. Your parents are coming for you. Days later, a legal threat arrived.

My father had leveraged the company to collapse, using funds to support Brian's six figure V P. Salary. Despite him never completing a project, the B M W. Was purchased on company credit. Most disturbing, he planned to use my trust fund to start a new venture, leaving the original company and its hundreds of employees to drown in debt. I spent months researching, then walked into the board meeting with grandpa's pocket watch in my pocket. If effective immediately, I am exercising my rights as majority shareholder, I announced, placing the legal documents on the table. I've prepared a new direction for the business, one that returns to the principles my grandfather established. By summer, I redirected resources from failing luxury developments to medical facilities and community housing. By fall, I eliminated redundant positions, including Brian's. My father received the news via certified letter, the same way he delivered my disownment. The quarterly reports, my father said. Now in my apartment, his voice hollow, the leadership changes. It was all you. I nodded. The board was quite receptive when I explained my position. But how could you, my mother whispered, after everything we've done for you? What exactly have you done for me? I leaned forward. You didn't pay for my education. Scholarships, did you? Didn't support my career. You resented it. So tell me, what am I supposed to be grateful for? My father stood suddenly. We're still your parents. Not according to the Document you had drawn up. I pulled out the disownment notice. Preserved in a clear sleeve. You hereby sever all familiar financial and emotional ties. Quite thorough. The company is struggling, he admitted. We're losing the house. The bank is for closing. Brian won't even return our calls. I thought of my childhood bedroom. Grandma's kitchen. Those memories belong to a different family now. I have positions available. I said, project assessment for you, community outreach for mom. Not at the top, but somewhere you can do meaningful work. Two weeks to decide. At the door, my mother paused. The BMW. Brian wrecked it three months after Christmas. Your father took out a second mortgage to replace it. Of course he had. I closed the door behind them. A year ago, they chose to cut me loose. Today, I chose whether to let them back in.

Then they handed me a folded letter with my name on it. Inside was a legal document titled notice of disownment with their signatures already dry at the bottom. When I asked what this meant, my mother simply said, you know, why? And, and back to taking photos of my brother in his new car. That was last year. This morning, they showed up unannounced at my apartment, faces pale after hearing what I had done. My mother perched on my second hand sofa like she was afraid to leave an impression. My father remained standing, the vintage Rolex absent from his wrist. The trust fund, he said flatly, your grandfather's trust fund. You found a way to access it. I poured myself water, taking a slow sip. I didn't find a way. I always had a way. Grandpa made sure of that. Grandpa Elliot knew exactly what kind of people my parents were long before I did. While they showcased Brian's barely passing grades with expensive gifts, Grandpa quietly attended my science fairs. When I won the state mathematics championship, my parents were at Brian's baseball tournament. Grandpa was the only one who stood and applauded. He'd been the only one at my medical school acceptance dinner who seemed genuinely proud when he died during My second year, they called it sudden. At the will reading, my parents sat smug, already planning how they would spend their inheritance. What they didn't expect was the trust fund, seven figures grown from decades of investment named solely to me. My mother had been livid. Brian has plans, too, she'd insisted. We'll contest it. Elliot was of sound mind, the attorney replied. He updated this trust three months ago with specific instructions. What nobody knew was that Grandpa had created a second trust, controlling 51% of the family business my father supposedly owned. Silent majority ownership activated only if two conditions were met. I completed medical school and my father turned his back on his children for money. The disownment papers signed weeks before Christmas qualified perfectly over the next.

The day came. I stood backstage in my dress, the one I bought with my own money. I could see the auditorium filling up. Other kids, families taking up old rows, parents with cameras, siblings holding flowers. I scanned for mine, praying they would show up. When my name was called, I walked across that stage, accepted my certificate and scholarship check. I looked out at the audience one more time. The seats that were reserved for my family members, empty seats, all four of them. I drove home alone, crying. I sat in the car for 10 minutes in the driveway staring at my certificate and scholarship letter, tried to make sense of it. They'd promised, mom had said wouldn't miss it to my face when I walked in, they were in the living room, pizza boxes everywhere, the kind loaded with cheese I couldn't eat. How'd it go, mom asked. I still staring at the TV. You didn't come. Oh, sweetie. Stephanie needed us. You know how moving is. I told you two weeks ago you promised dad finally look up. You got your certificate, didn't you? What's the problem? Stephanie grabbed another slice. Can we finish the movie now? I stood there in my dress holding proof I was worth something and they couldn't spare two hours. I've almost died four times. I thought to myself, you acted annoyed. Every time I've gotten straight A's for four years, joined your clubs, Learned your hobbies, made your recipes with ingredients that won't kill me, and you can't show up for two hours, something in me just stopped. I went upstairs, started packing, called my best friend's mom. Can I stay with you until college? I'm already on my way. I left a note on the kitchen table. Well, staying with a friend until further notice. Don't start worrying about me now. You never did anyways. Last week, dad left a voicemail from a random number. You're being ridiculous. Stephanie's engagement party is December. You need to be there. What will people think? I blocked him. I Learned that family isn't DNA.

I'm allergic to 17 different things. Shellfish, tree nuts, soy, eggs, dairy, sesame, certain food dyes. I found this out between ages 4 and 9 through hospital visits. That taught me what an Epipen feels like and what my mother's annoyed sigh sounds like when I'm in the ER for the fourth time that month. On the other hadn't. My older sister wasn't allergic to anything. By age 10, I knew the drill. Check every label for ingredients, carry two Epipens, ask about cross contamination. My allergist gave my parents a packet of safe foods, dangerous foods, emergency protocols. Mom put it in a drawer and never opened it again. It's too complicated, she said. Monitor yourself. You're the one with the allergies, not me. I was 10 years old. Dinner was whatever Stephanie wanted. Peanut sauce, chicken twice a week, shrimp stir fry Fridays, cheese casseroles. I sat there with plain baked potato and steamed carrots while they ate real meals. We can't change our entire lives because you have problems, dad said once. But I kept trying. I convinced myself if I could just be good enough, they'd see me. If I was perfect, maybe they'd realize I was worth accommodating. So I became perfect. I got straight A's, became the head of the school's Gooners comedy, never complained about my plain food or brown bag lunches. I started researching allergy free recipes and leaving Them on the counter, thinking maybe mom would try one. She never did. I tried joining their conversations at dinner. Learned about Stephanie's interests, asked questions about her life. She'd answer in one word and go back to her phone. My parents never asked about mine. I spent my saved lunch money on a cookbook with allergy free versions of Mom's recipes. Made dinner one night safe for me. Exactly like what they loved. Dad took one bite. Tastes weird. Where's the real version? Nothing worked. Fast forward to senior year. There was a school ceremony for students with perfect attendance and academic excellence. Four years, and I never missed a day.

Has anyone seen Jade Morrison? My stomach dropped. Did she take a wrong turn, get stuck in a stairwell? Was she still inside somewhere? The school was huge. What if she couldn't find an exit? When did anyone last see her? Reeves demanded. Silence. People look at each other, shrugged. I stayed silent, frozen. Two firefighters emerged from the building. False alarm, one announced. Building clear. But Principal Reeves rushed over to them, gesturing frantically. We watched them talk, saw their expressions change. They went back inside. We waited five minutes. 10 whispers spread through the crowd. Yo, what if she's, like, dead or something? 15 minutes passed. 20, my heart was pounding. This was my best friend. The firefighters came back out, shaking their heads. Jade wasn't in the building. That's when the police arrived. Two officers rushed inside with Principal Reeves. Ten minutes later, they came back out. One officer raised his voice. The security footage is too grainy and the hallways were too chaotic to identify anyone. If anyone has information on what Jade was wearing, we need to know now so we know what to look for. My eyes immediately dropped to my pink hoodie, my identical pink hoodie to the one Jade was wearing. Oh, my god, I whispered. I know what she was wearing. Every head turned to me. Pink hoodie, ripped jeans, white converse. I said louder. She's dressed exactly like this. Like me. We were doing twin Outfits. We're wearing the same thing. Principal Reeves glared at me. The officer's eyes widened. You're certain? Positive. Same everything. They were on the radios immediately describing the outfit. The officers and Principal Reeves rushed back in side to review the security footage, now knowing exactly what to look for. Thirty minutes later, the radio crackled. We found her. She's safe. She's at her house. The relief was overwhelming. Jade's mom arrived at school an hour later with Jade, who looked mortified. Turns out she'd gotten her period blood through her jeans and panicked. She pulled the fire alarm to create chaos so she could slip out without anyone noticing. She ran home, too embarrassed to tell anyone, not realizing the head count would reveal she was gone. People thought you died. I told her later. Trying to lighten the mood, Jade managed a weak smile. I felt like I was. Principal Reeves stood in front of the school the following Monday with a microphone. Twin Day is back on Friday. Let's do this right.

So our school had been hyping up Twin Day for weeks and everyone was planning who they'd match with my best friend. Jade and I had spent days perfecting our outfits, matching pink hoodies, ripped jeans, white converse, and even ordered the same scrunchies online. We planned our poses, our captions, everything. This was going to be legendary. Then three days before twin day, during dress as a figure from the past day, a senior guy showed up dressed as Sarah Mitchell, a girl from our school who taken her life last year. He copied her exact outfit from her memorial photo down to the jewelry, walked around doing an impression of her voice and when confronted, said she was technically part of our school's history now and that he was honoring her legacy. Students were sobbing. Teachers escorted Sarah's younger sister out of the building. Principal Reeves called an emergency assembly and her voice was shaking with rage. Spirit Week is over. Twin Day is cancelled. Every themed day is cancelled indefinitely. Regular dress code only. Anyone attempting to coordinate outfits or dress up in any way will face immediate suspension. Disappointment was crushing. Jade and I had already bought our matching outfits. The hallways buzzed with angry muttering about how one idiot ruined it for everyone. Reeve stood by the entrance the next morning like a guard dog, turning away anyone wearing anything remotely Coordinated. She actually made two girls change their shirts because they were too similar. This is about respect, kept saying. We can't have students targeting each other. The unfairness made my blood boil, but I couldn't let go of our twin idea. Jade and I decided we'd at least get yearbook photos together in our matching outfits. We change in the bathroom during lunch, take photos in the courtyard, then change back just for us, just to have the memory. So I stuffed the outfit in my backpack that morning. Pink hoodie, jeans, converse, crunchy. All morning, I felt weirdly rebellious carrying it around like I was smuggling something forbidden. Fourth period ended and Jade texted, meet me in the bathroom by the gym. Let's do this. We changed quickly, giggling at how identical we looked. We took maybe 50 photos, trying different poses, laughing at how we really did look like twins. We were just about to change back into our regular clothes. I was in a stall pulling my regular jeans back on when the fire alarm went off. Teachers in the hall shouted, leave everything, exit the building. When I got out of the stall, Jade was already gone. Figured she'd evacuated ahead of me, so I just followed everybody out to the football field. That's when things got weird. Teachers were doing head count, checking their rosters, recounting, then recounting again. Mr Patterson was running between groups with his clipboard. Principal Reeves appeared, walking fast, talking Into her phone. More teachers pulled out their phones. The energy shifted from annoyed to anxious to actual panic. A teacher's voice cut through the noise. I counted 23. I'm missing one, someone from the crowd shouted. Jade's not with us.

I played along and gathered evidence for five months. When he asked for divorce, his lawyer discovered I'd already liquidated everything, and his girlfriend left him. I still remember the exact moment my entire world shifted, yet somehow I managed to keep my face completely neutral. It was a Thursday evening in late March, and I was sitting in my sister Vanessa's living room for our monthly book club meeting. We had just finished discussing the latest thriller novel when the conversation drifted toward relationships and marriage, as it often did when wine started flowing freely. Adrian, one of Vanessa's friends from her yoga studio, had joined our group about six months earlier. She was friendly enough, though we had never really connected on a deeper level outside of these monthly gatherings. She was the type who loved to gossip and always had some dramatic story to share about people in her life. That evening, Adrian was telling us about a couple she knew who had recently opened their marriage and how it seemed to be working well for them, despite initial skepticism from their friends. She went on about how modern relationships were evolving and how traditional monogamy did not work for everyone anymore. Most of us nodded along politely, some more interested than others in the topic. Then Adrian turned to me with what I can only describe as a knowing smile. And said something that made my blood run cold, though I somehow managed not to show it. She asked how I felt about Derek dating that woman from his gym and whether it had been difficult to adjust to the arrangement at first. She said she admired couples who could make open relationships work, and that it took real maturity and security to allow your partner that kind of freedom.

My Aunt Carol stood up and walked out. My Uncle James shook his head in disbelief. But Melissa continued her speech, completely oblivious to or uncaring about the pain she was causing. She finished by saying she was grateful to have such wonderful parental figures in her life who supported her happiness. I couldn't take it anymore. I stood up and left the restaurant with Emma following close behind. Dad joined us a few minutes later. He was shaking, his face pale. He said he wanted to leave, that he couldn't stay and watch this anymore. I drove him home while Emma followed in her car. At his house, dad broke down completely. He said he had given Melissa everything, had worked extra hours to pay for her college education without loans, had supported her dreams even when they were expensive, and this was how she repaid him. He said he felt invisible, like his 30 years of marriage and 28 years of fatherhood meant nothing. I stayed with dad that night, worried about leaving him alone in such emotional pain. The next morning, Melissa called me screaming. She said I had ruined her rehearsal dinner by making a scene and leaving. She said, my dramatic exit. Had upset several guests and made her look bad. I told her she had made herself look bad by publicly humiliating our father, but she insisted I was being oversensitive and that her speech had been perfectly appropriate. The wedding was the next day. Dad told me he wasn't going to attend. He couldn't sit through a ceremony where he would be treated as an afterthought while Gregory was celebrated.

Now 7 years later, he's out and I'm all alone with my kids hating me. I'm a selfish person. At least that is what I say to myself repeatedly almost every night when I hear the silence in my home. My children aren't here. My ex husband hates me with good reason. My immediate family is divided and I never stopped hating myself for what I did. My selfish act happened in 2015. I had just turned 39 and I admit I took my ex husband for granted. My ex always told me that I was beautiful on a daily basis, always wanted to be in bed with me, always took care of me and treated me like his equal. He never treated me like a queen or a princess. I was his partner. We've been married for 20 years. By that time, high school sweethearts, each other's one and only and it felt right. My family loved him. My brother looked up to him and my ex helped him through a lot of tough situations. My ex was the one people called when they were in trouble and he helped them. He was a good man. Through the years, I gave him two headstrong boys. At the time of this, they were eighteen. I was conscious of my weight and felt self conscious and he would tell me that I was Beautiful. Our arguments were always few and far between. We talked everything out. But when we did argue, it was usually about the time in bed or lack thereof on my behalf and the things I refused to do in bed. It wasn't as if I didn't want to do them, it's just that I wasn't in the mood. And he understood.

This wasn't me coming home drunk or forgetting her birthday or anything that actually deserved punishment. I fixed our AC during a heat wave with my own property. I grabbed my pillow and phone charger and went straight to the guest room. Slept absolutely amazing. Actually way better than our 10 year old saggy mattress that desperately needs replacing but we can't afford right now. At 6:30 a. M. She barged into the guest room without knocking and turned on the lights. Why didn't you sleep on the couch like I specifically told you to? I was genuinely confused, thought maybe she was joking again because there's a bedroom right here with a real bed. Why would anyone choose a couch? She sat down on the edge of the bed and her tone got dead serious. Gave me this whole speech about marriage and respect, about how when one spouse tells the other to sleep on the couch, they're supposed to do it exactly as instructed, not find a comfortable loophole, not use logic to get around it. Just do it to prove you respect a relationship and feel genuine remorse for your actions. I sat up and looked at her. I was being punished for using my own gaming PC to fix our broken AC during summer. What exactly am I supposed to feel remorse about? That was apparently the completely wrong thing to say. She stood up and said it stopped about the PC the moment I refused to follow her clear instructions that I was being deliberately difficult and dismissive of her feelings that choosing the guest room was me being a smart ass and trying to win on a technicality. I asked what she actually wanted me to say and she just walked out and slammed the door hard. Now it's been three full days of this Cold War. She barely speaks to me, sleeps with her back turned to my side, makes her own separate dinner and eats it alone in the bedroom. This morning, her mom called me at work saying, I need to stop being so stubborn and just apologize already that I'm making a huge deal out of something small, small. I'm the one who solved our AC crisis and somehow I'm still the bad guy here. My coworker says his wife pulled the exact same couch thing and he just does it every time to keep the peace. Says it's not worth the fight. But I'm not apologizing for choosing a bed over a couch when I didn't even do anything wrong in the first place.

I sold my gaming PC for $800 without telling her first. I've had that thing since college. Built it myself sophomore year with my roommate. Spent every penny from my summer job on it. But I barely touched it in the past two years. Maybe turned it on twice. Meanwhile, our AC completely died during a 95 degree heat wave and the repair company ordered us $750. We had exactly 2 hundred dollars in our checking account and payday wasn't until next Friday, 9 days away. I posted the PC on Facebook marketplace at 9 a. M. With detailed specs and photos. By 2 p. M. Some college kid showed up at our door with 800 dollar cash. Didn't even try to negotiate. I handed $750 to the AC guy who was scheduled for 3 p. M, kept 50 dollars for gas money, and thought I was being responsible and smart. My wife got home from work at 6 and walked straight into my office like she always does. She froze in the doorway. Where's your computer? Did someone break in? I explained the whole situation, showed her the AC receipt on the counter, even pulled up the Facebook messages on my phone. She stared at the receipt for a solid 10 seconds, then her face went red and she said, you sold something worth $800 without even texting me? That's a major Financial decision. I tried explaining it was tech. Mine from before we got married. It was collecting dust and we desperately needed the AC fixed or we'd be sleeping in a sauna. She cut me off mid sentence. I don't care whose it was. Legally, we're married now. You should have called me at lunch. I would have said yes. But you didn't even ask. Then came the punishment. Sleep on the couch tonight. I actually laughed out loud because I. I thought she was joking. We have a guest bedroom right across the hall with a full size bed that literally nobody uses except when her parents visit twice a year. Why would I fold my 6.2 frame onto our tiny, uncomfortable couch when there's a perfectly good empty room 10 feet away? I told her that exact logic and she got even more furious. The couch is the entire point. It's supposed to be uncomfortable. That's how you show you're actually sorry for what you did.

In the end, she realised she was only manipulating herself. When I was 11, I picked up my dad's guitar and strummed the strings. It sounded cool, but I wanted it louder. So I strummed again really hard. This time the thinnest string snapped and hit my face. My stomach dropped. I stared at the broken string hanging limp, holding my cheek. I started tearing up. That's when my 17 year old sister Natasha appeared in the doorway. Oh my god. Her voice was sharp. You broke Dad's guitar. I didn't mean to. He's going to freak out. She stepped closer. You know how he is about his guitar. He'll disown. Tears filled my eyes. I'm sorry. He's going to send you to the bad children home, she interrupted. You won't see us ever again. I started crying. That's when her face changed. But I won't tell him. My eyes lit up. Thank you. Thank you. This sis, you're the best. She hugged me. But you have to do something for me in return. I pulled back. Anything. She smiled. Perfect. Someone's going to be coming to our house in an hour. Promise you won't tell anyone who? I was confused. Who's coming over? Doesn't matter. Do you promise or not? My heart was pounding. I promise. She smiled. Good girl. An hour later, there was a knock at the door. I opened it. Taylor was standing there, my sister's boyfriend's Best friend. Hey, he looked past me. Is Natasha here? I let him in. My stomach felt weird. They went upstairs to her room. I sat on the couch trying to understand why Alexander's best friend was here, why Natasha didn't want me to tell him. An hour later, they came down. Her hair was ruffled. Baylor left without saying much. I found Natasha in the kitchen. Why was Baylor here? She was getting water. What do you mean? Does Alexander know? Of course he knows. Fine. But it didn't feel fine. Then why did you tell me not to tell anyone if Alexander knows? She turned to face me. Because mom and dad don't like people over when they're not home. So don't say anything to anyone. Wanted to ask more questions, but she was looking at me hard. Remember the guitar? I gulped and nodded. Baylor came over three more times over the next month. Each time, Natasha blackmailed me. I felt sick every time, especially because Alexander was perfect. He visit our family. He was nice to me. Asked about school, treated Natasha like she was the only girl in the world. He had a little sister named Fen who was my best friend. I wanted to tell him my gut instinct.

My sister Katie and I are twins and we both ended up pregnant at the same time. She got pregnant about 3 weeks before me and immediately decided this meant our pregnancies had to be like some weird twin bonding experience. The first thing she did was try to get me to do matching baby names. She wanted us to name our babies Edmond and Edward if they were boys or Ethel and Mabel if they were girls. She kept going on about how cute it would be for twin moms to have matching baby names and how it was meant to be. Here's the problem. Those names are absolutely terrible. Edmond and Ethel sound like they belong to people who died in 1890. I told Katie that me and my husband Jake, were going to pick our own name without worrying about what she chose. She did not take that well. She got all pouty and said I was ruining what could be a special twin moment. Then she switched tactics and started asking me constantly what names we were consider. At first, it was just when we hung out. Then it became text every single day. The same text would come through at like two PM have you guys decided on a name yet? If I didn't answer, she'd text again later or call or message me on Instagram asking the same thing. This went on for weeks. I told her multiple times to stop asking because we weren't sharing the name yet. She'd promised to stop. And then the next day the text would start again. I started just ignoring her when she asked. But that somehow made it worse. My husband and I had already picked out the perfect name months ago. We loved it and didn't want anyone's opinion on it. But we especially didn't want Katie to know because I had this gut feeling she would try to either use it herself or pick something that matched with it. See, Katie has always been a little competitive with me, not in a mean way, but in this weird twin way where she needs us to do everything together. Or similarly, when I got engaged, she got engaged four months later. When I bought a house, she started looking at houses in the same neighborhood. Last week, I finally hit my breaking point when she texted me seven times in one day asking about baby names. That's when Jake suggested we just give her a fake name. At first, I thought it was too mean, but then I thought about it more. Katie thinks any unique name is weird. I once told her years ago that I liked the name Meadow and she acted like I said I wanted to name my kid helicopter. So I figured if I gave her something really out there, she'd actually believe it because To her, it would track with my taste. I texted her back and said, fine, you win. We picked a name. She immediately called me, freaking out with excitement. I told her we decided on Stardust if it's a girl. There was this long pause on the phone, then she goes, Stardust? Like the actual word?

I've always been my brother's biggest fan. We're two years apart and basically best friends. Growing up. We did everything together. He taught me how to ride a bike. I helped him pass algebra. We had each other's backs no matter what. So when he invited me to his championship soccer game, I showed up with a cowbell, face paint and zero shame. This was the regional finals. Scouts were there. This game mattered. The bleachers were packed. I squeezed into a spot near the front, right behind the student section. The energy was insane. Everyone was screaming, chanting, stomping their feet so hard the metal benches shook. But me, I took it to another level. Every time my brother touched the ball, I screamed his name like a maniac. Let's go, Cody. That's my brother. I rang that cowbell until my hand went numb. The whole crowd was loud, but I was loud, loud. About halfway through the first half, I noticed this girl a few rows down, long brown hair, varsity jacket, sitting with two other girls. She kept turning around and glaring at me. At first I thought maybe I was just being too obnoxious, so I tried to tone it down a little. But then during half time, I heard her loud and clear. She was talking to her friends, but her voice carried. Someone behind us needs to shut up about My boyfriend, like we get it. He's good, but he's mine. My stomach dropped. I looked at my brother down on the field. He was talking to his coach, drinking water, looking focused. He talking about him. I wanted to lean forward and ask, excuse me, who's your boyfriend? But I chickened out. Instead, I convinced myself she had to be dating someone else on the team, some other player, because if that was my brother's girlfriend, he had seriously terrible taste and he definitely would have mentioned her to me. Right second half started. My brother was on fire. He scored twice. I couldn't help myself. I went right back to screaming his name, ringing that bell, jumping up and down. This was his moment. But every time I cheered, that girl would whip her head around and glare at me with this intense, scary look. Her friends kept whispering to her, trying to calm her down. At one point, I saw her friend grab her arm like she was physically stopping her from coming up to me. I started to feel uncomfortable, like genuinely unsafe. But I wasn't going to let some random jealous girl stop me from supporting my brother. He needed me. This was the biggest game of his life. Final whistle blows. We win 3, 1. The entire team rushes the field, dog piling on top of each other. Parents and students start letting down.

She knocked and asked what was going on. I told her through the door that I was already asleep and she was being too loud. She did not think it was funny. She started banging on the door saying this was insane and that I couldn't lock her out of her own room. I reminded her that she'd been doing the exact same thing to me for three months and that maybe now she'd understand how annoying it was. She yelled that it wasn't the same because she had a reason and I was just being petty. I asked her what her reason was. She went quiet for a minute and then said she didn't owe me an explanation. So I told her she could sleep on the couch and think about it. She slept in her car that night. I know because I heard her started up around 1 in the morning and when I looked out the window, she was sitting in the driver's seat with the heat running. The next morning she came back in and said we needed to talk. I unlocked the bedroom door and let Her in. She sat on the bed and tried to tell me that what I did was way worse than what she did because I changed the locks without telling her. I asked her if she was serious right now. She said she wanted her key back. I said, sure, but only if she agreed to stop locking me out when I came home from work. She said that wasn't fair because she wasn't doing it to be mean. She just needed space sometimes I, I told her that space didn't mean locking your boyfriend out of the bedroom every night for months. We went back and forth like this for maybe 20 minutes before she finally admitted that she'd been talking to her ex on video calls at night and didn't want me around for it. She said it wasn't cheating because they were just friends now and I was being controlling by having a problem with it. I handed her a trash bag and told her she had until the end of the day to get her stuff out.

Sir, this order is still active. You need to leave now. That's ridiculous. She's my daughter. That's my granddaughter. She's also 32 years old. And you're trespassing on her property. I have rights. The officer's expression hardened. What you have is a restraining order and about 30 seconds to get in your car before I arrest you. My dad's face went from red to purple. He looks directly at me through the window, jabbing his finger in my direction. You'll regret this when I'm gone and you realize what you've done. You'll regret this. The younger officer stepped between him and the house. Leave now. As they walked him to his car, I noticed my neighbors had come outside, the Chens from next door, Missus Rodriguez from across the street. They'd all heard the screaming. My phone exploded with messages. My aunt saying I was heartless. My cousin asking why I couldn't just give him five minutes. My grandmother crying about family forgiveness. But my uncle sent something different, a screenshot my dad had been posting on social media about his full daughter who wouldn't let him meet his granddaughter, setting up a narrative, building sympathy. I forwarded everything to my lawyer. My daughter tugged my sleeve. Mommy, why was that man so angry? I knelt down to her level. Some people think family means you owe them everything just because you share blood. But real family Is the people who show up when it matters, who keep their promises, who earn their place in your life. Like you and Grammy. Exactly like me and Grammy. She hugged her rabbit tighter. I'm glad he's not my family. Then three days later, my lawyer sent me an update. Dad had filed for grandparent visitation rights. We had a court date in six weeks. Spent that evening adding to my folder every Facebook post where he called me names, every text from relatives demanding I be the bigger person, every piece of evidence showing exactly who he was. When the court date came, the judge took one look at the restraining order, the unpaid child support and the six year absence petition. Denied.

Now I checked my detergent, too, also half gone. I started thinking about the timing. Mia's complaint started exactly two weeks ago, right when I bought that new fabric softener. Sunday night, I set up my old phone in the laundry room, propped it on top of the detergent shelf, camera facing the machines, record and left. I worked my usual overnight shift at the hospital, came home at 6 a. M. Exhausted, downloaded the footage, fast forwarded through hours of nothing, empty machines, dark room. Then at 3:47 a. M, the lights flipped on. Mia walked in wearing pajamas, carrying a laundry basket. She went straight to the shelf, picked up my bottle of fabric softener, my detergent, poured a full cap of softener into the washer, added the detergent, started loading her clothes. She'd been using my expensive hospital grade products for weeks. The chemical smell she kept complaining about was literally just the smell of actually clean clothes. My stuff costs 10 times what regular detergent costs because it's designed to remove bloodborne pathogens and hospital contamination. It's industrial strength. She been stealing my supplies, using them on her own laundry, then accusing me of tampering with her clothes. I watched the whole video. She even checked the hallway twice to make sure nobody saw her. I sent the video to the group chat with one message, found the thief. Casey called her immediately. I could hear Mia's voice through the Wall getting defensive. I thought it was communal. It was just sitting there. Brandon replied in the chat. It was on the shelf labeled with her name. Mia tried claiming she didn't see the label, that she was half asleep, that it was an honest mistake. I sent another message two weeks. Not a mistake. Casey knocked on my door an hour later. I'm sorry. I believed her. That's insane. Mia avoided me for three days, wouldn't make eye contact, stayed in her room. Then I got a text from our landlord asking about the Wi Fi password. Apparently Mia told him she couldn't remember it. I changed it that night. She could buy her own internet. Two weeks later, Mia's mom showed up with a U Haul. Casey told me later that Mia owed $300 in utility bills she never paid.

Kylie started crying happy tears. She's holding my hand. She likes me. We stayed like that for maybe 10 minutes. Kylie talked to the baby in the soft voice, telling her about all the things they do together when she got bigger, how they go to the park and get ice cream and watch cartoons. It was honestly the sweetest thing I'd ever seen. Then I heard the front door open. Mom's book club must have ended early. I didn't even have time to move before she walked into the living room. Her face went white. Then read, what are you doing? She rushed over and scoop the baby out of Kylie's arms so fast that Kylie yelled, mom, she was fine. I was helping her the whole time. Mom held my daughter against her chest and turned to face me. That was completely irresponsible. Kylie's hands can't be trusted. What if she dropped her? What if something happened? Kylie stood up, tears streaming down her face. Now, I didn't drop her. I was being careful. Mom didn't even look at her. Go to your room, Kylie. Now. Kylie grabbed her backpack and ran upstairs. I could hear her bedroom door slam. Mom turned back to me. When I say no, as a parent, you need to respect that. I don't care if you're an adult. Now, that's my daughter sitting in that chair. And these are The rules I set for her safety. And this is my daughter, I said, pointing to the baby. And I decide who gets to hold her. Mom's jaw clenched. You don't understand what could happen. Kylie could have hurt her without meaning to. Her condition makes it unsafe. She's not some fragile bomb. I shot back. She's gotten so much better. She just held the baby perfectly fine for 10 minutes. You didn't even see it because I didn't need to see it to know it was wrong. Mom put the baby in her bassinet and grabbed her purse. I'm disappointed in you. You put your child at risk just to make your sister feel included. She left without saying goodbye. I sat there on the couch feeling like garbage. Then I heard footsteps on the stairs. Kylie came down holding that stuffed giraffe, eyes all red and puffy. I'm sorry I got you in trouble. You didn't do anything wrong. I pulled her into a hug. You are amazing with her, really. But now mom hates me. She's hates both of us. Kylie buried her face in my shoulder.

She scheduled an urgent team meeting at four PM on a Friday. That should have been my first red flag. We all file into the conference room. There's 21 of us total. Eight parents, 13 without kids. She starts passing out printed memos with a fake smile plastered on her face. I'm excited to share some organizational changes effective November 1st. I read the first line and my blood pressure spikes. Mandatory hours 8:00am to eight PM, Monday through Sunday, with weekends worked on an as needed basis. I flip a page. 2 exception. Team members with children will maintain standard 9:00am to five five PM hours, Monday to Friday only. She finishes her presentation. Any questions? My hand shoots up. Yeah, I have a question. In what world did you think this would be okay? She doesn't even flinch. Due to circumstances over the past few months, team members with children have fallen behind on projects while managing childcare. We need to pick up up the slack to meet our quarterly targets. I pulled up our project dashboard on my laptop, turned the screen toward her. Based on yesterday's status meeting, every single child free team member is on track. Most of us are finishing projects three to four days before deadline. So you're telling me that those of us without kids have to work an additional 40 hours per week to complete Projects for people who won't even help finish those same projects. I'm struggling to understand why this is such a big issue for you. I looked around the table. Is anyone else okay with this? All eight of my child free teammates shook their heads. The parents stared at their memos in silence. This is absolutely insane, I said. You realize that, right? She just linked at me. One more question. Will you also be working these hours with us? Long pause. No. I have a child. Your kid is 18 years old and in college. Ill. My child. I was ready to throw my laptop through the window. She just ended the meeting without another word. I immediately regrouped with my child free team in the break room. We were all furious. I sent her an email within 10 minutes. We are formally requesting a meeting with HR and the legal department to review our employment contracts and discuss the proposed mandatory hours. Were being required to work solely because we don't have children. My phone rang three minutes later. It was her. There's absolutely no need to involve HR.

The custody hearing was four weeks later. Grant brought Mister Walsh, the pool manager, three different parents and our family doctor who said she'd noted concerns about the boys aggressive behaviour in their files for two years. His lawyer played that recording of me dismissing Kevin's broken nose. Then they showed text where I told grant to stop being soft and let boys be boys. I lost. Judge gave grant primary custody, said the boys needed structure and consequences I wasn't providing. I got them every other weekend with a court appointed supervisor present. The supervisor was this young woman named Holly who wrote down everything I said and did. First supervised visit, Kevin asked why they had to see me with a babysitter. I started to explain it was all a misunderstanding, that their dad was being dramatic, but Polly cut me off and said we should play a board game instead. The boys barely talked to me the whole three hours. Grant enrolled them in counseling, started teaching them about boundaries and apologies and taking responsibility. Kevin wrote a letter to Otto saying sorry for bullying him. Austin made a card for the kid from the pool. Grant posted about it on Facebook and got like 200 supportive comments. Made my own post saying I was a victim of parental discrimination and the system was broken. Got 37 reactions, mostly angry faces. And my sister commented telling Me to delete it and get therapy. I blocked her. Month 4 of the new custody arrangement, I showed up for my weekend visit and the boys asked Holly if they could skip it, said they had plans with their dad to go hiking and didn't want to miss it. They looked at me, then back at them and said we could reschedule. I drove home alone. Grant sent me a text that night with a photo of the boys at the top of some trail, both of them actually smiling. Caption said, first hike without a fight, progress. I stared at that photo for 20 minutes. They looked happier than I'd seen them in years. My lawyer called last week and said grant was filing to modify the custody order, asking for supervised visits to be reduced to once monthly. He had documentation from their therapist showing the boys were thriving with less contact with me. The hearing is next month.

Kylie is 9 years old and has been so pumped about being an aunt, she kept asking me when she could finally meet her niece, sending me excited texts with a million exclamation points and baby emojis for weeks. The thing is, Kylie has a physical disability. Her hands shake when she holds things and she struggles with stuff like buttoning shirts or holding a pen steady. It's just something she was born with, but she's gotten way better over the years with physical therapy and practice. When my daughter was born three weeks ago, my whole family came to visit at the hospital. Kylie walked in with this huge smile, holding a stuffed giraffe she'd saved up her allowance money to buy. She stood next to my bed and just stared at the baby with these wide eyes. I hold her, she whispered. Before I could answer, our mom jumped in. No, honey, maybe when you're older. Kylie's face fell, but I'm old enough now. I've been practicing with my dolls. Mom shook her head and pulled Kylie away from the bed. Your hands can't be trusted around a Newborn. It's too dangerous. I watched Kylie's eyes fill up with tears, but she didn't argue. She just nodded and sat in the corner chair clutching that giraffe. The whole visit, she barely said anything, just stared at the floor. After everyone left, I couldn't stop thinking about her. Face. So when we got home from the hospital, I texted Kylie and told her to come over the next afternoon when mom was at her book club meeting. She showed up wearing her favorite purple hoodie, the one with the cat ears. She looked nervous. I sat on the couch and positioned pillows on both sides of me. Then I had Kylie sit right next to me, super close. I'm going to put the baby in your arms, but I'm keeping my hands under her the whole time. Okay? Kylie nodded so fast, I thought her head might fall off. I carefully placed my daughter in Kylie's lap. My hands stayed underneath, supporting the baby's head and body. Kylie's hands were shaking a little, but she kept them steady by resting her elbows on the armrest. She stared down at my daughter like she was holding the most precious thing in the world. She's so tiny, Kylie whispered. Her fingers so small.

I thought maybe being honest would work. It didn't. She just got worse. I started ignoring even my dad's real text to show how serious I was. But a few months ago, Kelly showed up at my grandparents house unannounced with all three of her kids. I was out with friends when she first got there and my grandparents were telling her to leave. When I got home and saw her car in the driveway, I was already annoyed. But then she came rushing up to me with these three little kids and tried to do introductions like we were at some happy family reunion. This is your brother, Jake, and this is Emma and this is the baby, Noah. I told her to leave it alone and go away. That's when she completely lost it on me. He started yelling about how I had siblings now whether I liked it or not, and we needed to know each other. Then she said this thing that made my blood boil. She said she tried so hard to be good to me and I constantly rejected her when I didn't even have a living mom anymore. She was doing me some huge favor by forcing herself into my life. I completely snapped. I screamed at her to fuck off and leave me alone. I told her I don't care about her or her kids and I'm never going to be their Brother, I said I won't be her son and we're not family. I called her a stupid bitch because after years of hearing no, she still didn't get it. I told her she doesn't know her place in my life, which is nowhere, because she's nothing to me, just my dad's wife who won't take a hint. She started screaming back, but my grandparents came outside and threatened to call the cops. I went inside while they handled it and eventually got her to leave with her kids. Since that day, she's been blowing up my dad's phone with angry texts saying I owe her an apology for losing my shit and taking everything out on her. My dad even called once to say I went too far. Now she's telling their whole family that I'm cruel and heartless to innocent children who just wanted to meet their big brother.

After years of her forcing a relationship with me and her kids, my mom died when I was 6 and my dad decided he didn't want to raise me alone. So he gave me to my grandma and grandpa to raise instead. He basically disappeared from my life. Then when I was 11, he randomly took my grandparents to court for visitation rights, not because he missed me or anything, but because his new wife, Kelly, wanted me to be part of their perfect little family. The judge made it so my dad could call and text me, but I didn't have to actually see him. The thing is, my dad barely used those rights. Maybe a text every few weeks asking how school was going. But Kelly, she went crazy with it. She text me constantly asking if I wanted to come over for dinner or if she could take me to McDonald's. My grandparents told her over and over that I wasn't interested. When I was 13, she had her first baby with my dad. She wanted me at the hospital to meet the baby. I didn't go. She sent me a million photos and kept inviting me over. Then she did this insane thing where she hired a photographer and booked a sibling photo session without even asking us first. Just assumed I'd show up to take pictures with a baby I'd never met. After that first kid, she Got so much worse. Every time she had another baby, the pressure increased. She'd use my dad's phone to text me since technically he was allowed unlimited contact. My grandparents tried taking it back to court, but the judge said it wasn't a big deal. Two years ago, my dad actually sued for real visitation time because Kelly wanted him to force me to spend time with her and the kids. Thank god the judge listened to me and said no. I was 15 by then and old enough to have a say. Last Christmas, I finally told her directly that all this pushing was making me hate.

The coffee maker, the toaster, the Instant Pot, even the living room curtains, because I bought and installed the rods myself. My friend Jake surveyed the increasingly empty apartment. This is brutal, they said. I contribute nothing. I'm just proving them right. Their belongings fit in small piles in the center of each room. One TV, one floor lamp, and scattered makeup products. I even powered on the TV they and so protective of and logged out of my Netflix account. Now it was all theirs. A black screen with nothing to watch. I took videos and photos of everything, texted them to Patricia with receipts attached. Leaving today. This is everything I'm taking, all purchased by me. Here's documentation. Keys will be with you by 5 p m. Six hours after we started, my room was empty. The common areas were bare, and their stuff sat in sad little islands on the hardwood floor. Everything they taken for granted was gone. The apartment echoed. I dropped my keys with Patricia in person. She looked at the receipts on her iPad, then at me. They told me you didn't contribute anything. Apparently, furniture doesn't count. She smiled. They're going to need your room filled immediate, or they'll have to cover your portion. That's $900 each extra per month. Good luck to them, I said. They won't find anyone, Patricia said quietly, Monday night, my phone exploded with locked numbers. I blocked them. Everywhere. But they were trying. From friends, phones, texting, apps, even email. Hundreds of messages. Accusations, threats, begging. I didn't open a single one. Patricia forwarded me their panicked messages. She stole everything. The apartment is empty. This is illegal. Patricia's response was beautiful. According to her receipts and the photos she provided before leaving, she only took items she purchased. You have until the end of the month to find someone for the third room, or you'll need to cover her rent. They tried finding someone for my room. But complaining about their ex roommate to every potential tenant isn't great marketing. By day 20, they still hadn't found anyone, and Patricia had already started making calls. She knew every landlord in our college town because they met monthly for coffee and shared information about problem tenants. Difficult tenants, she told them. Blamed their responsible roommate for everything. Couldn't make rent? Started drama with everyone. When the sisters couldn't come up with my portion of the rent, Patricia started the eviction process. They had two weeks to come up with the money or get out. Their apartment hunt went exactly as expected. Every application came back with the same responses. Sorry, just rented to someone else. We're going with other tenants. Your application wasn't selected. They wanted me to contribute nothing. Wish granted. Now they know exactly what nothing looks like.

I'm okay, I said quietly. She waved her hand. Don't be embarrassed. We're family. I'm just trying to help you. Ryan's dad nodded. You'd feel so much better. That's when Ryan's mom put down her fork and reached across the table to grab my hand. Sweetie, have you thought about weight loss surgery? Honestly, it would change everything for you. The entire table went silent. Even her friends looked uncomfortable. I stood up, and my chair made a loud scraping noise. If you wanna talk about bodies. My voice shook, but it was loud. Let's talk about yours. Ryan's mom blinked. Excuse me? Your face, I said. All that plastic surgery makes you look like you're wearing a mask. Your lips are so big you can barely close your mouth. And you look surprised all the time because you can't even move your forehead anymore. She gasped. I turned to Ryan's dad. And you. You sit there judging what I eat. When you breathe like you just ran a race. Every time you stand up, your stomach hangs over your belt. His face turned bright red. Ryan's sister tried to say something, but I cut her off. You post photos without me because you think you look better alone. But you dress like you're still in your 20s. When you're almost 40, everyone talks about how desperate you look. Ryan's mom had tears running down her face. His sister looked like she might throw up. His dad was Gripping his fork so hard his knuckles were white. I have been nothing but kind to you for three years while you picked apart every single thing about me. I said every meal, every photo, every comment, pretending to be concerned. You made me hate myself. You made me scared to eat. You made me feel worthless. And I'm done. Brian stood up next to me. For a second, I thought he'd apologize for me. Instead, he looked at his mom and said, she's right. You've been cruel to her since day one. And I let it happen because I didn't want to fight with you. That makes me just as bad. But I'm done now. We're leaving, and we're not coming back. His mom started crying hard. Ryan, we were just helping her. No, you were being bullies. He said, don't contact us. We're done. He grabbed my hand, and we walked out in the car. Ryan apologized over and over. He said he should have protected me years ago. Do you agree with them about my weight? I asked. He hesitated for just a second too long before saying no. Which told me everything I needed to know. I dumped him.

Oh, so you're just living here now? I paused my Netflix show and looked up. Megan stood in the doorway with her backpack still on, and Ashley hovered behind her, both of them wearing that weird synchronized glare they always got when they rehearsed something together. I do live here, I said, pausing my show. You're always out here using the TV, the couch, Ashley said. You contribute nothing to this place, but you sure act like you own it. I looked between them and noticed how they glanced at each other like this was all rehearsed. I decided not to engage. Okay. I grabbed my laptop and headed to my room. I figured they had a bad day, maybe bombed a test or something. Whatever it was, I'd let it blow over. Except 10 minutes later, Megan knocked once and opened my door without waiting for an answer. Starting now, she said, her voice cold and deliberate, you don't touch anything that isn't yours. Got it? I looked up from my bed. What? You heard me. Nothing that isn't yours. The door closed before I could respond. For eight months, I've been quietly furnishing our place, buying household items, covering utilities when they were short. I never made a big deal about it, but apparently I was the problem. The next day, I was in my room when I heard them in the kitchen. Patricia totally believed us. Megan said. I told her she's hostile and refuses to contribute. Ashley laughed, and I reminded her we were here first, so we get final say on who stays. Within an hour, Patricia called me. The girls think it's not working out. Maybe you should start looking for a new place. They want me gone? I asked. They've been here longer. They're saying you're difficult. I paid rent early every single month. Never a complaint from neighbors. But sure, I was the difficult one. I understand. I told Patricia. I'll handle it. I spent the next few days planning that weekend. Megan announced they were going to their cousin's wedding upstate. Three day weekend. They'd be leaving Friday morning, back Monday night. Perfect. Friday at 9:00am, their car disappeared around the corner. By 9:15, I had three friends with trucks pulling up. By noon, we were in full operation mode. The cow which they've been sprawled on every night. Mine. Bought it off Facebook Marketplace. Still have the messages. The kitchen table where Megan loved hosting her friends. IKEA receipt in my email. Assembled it myself with my dad when I moved in. So I just took the Wi-Fi router because my name was on the account.

Before she could protest again, I smiled and said, have a good day, and walked away. I didn't give her the chance to argue or hand it back. When I sat back down, my mom squeezed my hand under the table. That was perfect, honey. You just did something beautiful. Those kids didn't walk to the concession stand. They ran. I mean, actually ran. The little one could barely keep up, and the oldest girl was holding his hand, pulling him along. They came back five minutes later with sodas, candy, popcorn, ice cream, everything their hands could carry. They sat back down at their table, and suddenly they were loud, laughing, joking around. The kind of noise happy kids make when the world feels right. The youngest one had chocolate ice cream all over his face. He was completely lost in it, smiling so big his eyes were practically closed. Swinging his legs under the table, not a care in the world. My mom watched him for a moment, then turned to me. Look at that little boy. That right there is what matters. That joy. That's why we do this. I asked her, do you do this a lot? She smiled. When I can. You never know what someone's carrying, honey. A small act can change someone's entire day, sometimes their entire week. Sometimes it's the thing that reminds them people still care. We lost my mom to cancer in September 2014. She was 58. Years old. I've got hundreds of memories like this one of her slipping money to waitresses who looked tired. Paying for someone's groceries in line behind us. Buying extra meals and leaving them with homeless people she'd pass on her morning walks. But this memory is the one that stuck with me the most. Because she didn't just teach me to give money. She taught me how to let people keep their dignity while you help them. She taught me that kindness isn't just about the giving. It's about how you give. It's about making someone feel human, not helpless. Every time I see someone struggling now, I hear her voice. You never know what someone's carrying. And I think about those four kids at the zoo running toward that concession stand like it was Christmas morning.

This girl walks into my shop on a Tuesday afternoon wanting massive angel wings across her entire back. Not just any wings, though. She wants them hyper realistic with individual feathers that start decaying and falling apart as they go down her spine, super intricate shading, the whole thing. I pull up my portfolio and show her similar work I've done. She's nodding along enthusiastically asking about color gradients and whether we can add gold highlights to certain feathers. I'm getting excited because this is the kind of project I love. So I start explaining the process. It's going to take at least four sessions, maybe five, each one around three hours minimum. The placement means we'll be working mostly over her ribs, fine and shoulder blades, which are some of the most painful spots you can tattoo. I tell her all of this while sketching out the basic design. She's still nodding, still seems totally confident. Then casually like it's no big deal, she mentions this will be her first tattoo. I actually put my pencil down and just look at her first tattoo. I ask her to repeat that because I must have heard wrong. She confirms it, smiling like this totally normal lady. I tell her I have clients with full sleeves who've tapped out on rib work, people who've sat through eight hour sessions without flinching will cry doing Ribs. She insists she has a high pain tolerance, says she's done hot yoga and gotten through two root canals without numbing. I try to explain that tattoo pain is different. It's constant and builds over time. But she waves me off. She's researched this. She's ready. She wants to start today. Against my better judgment, I book her. I even offer to do a small test patch first on her shoulder blade, somewhere less painful. But she refuses. She wants to start the actual piece. We begin the outline on her right wing. Within five minutes, I can see her hands start to shake. At 10 minutes, she's gripping the table so hard, her knuckles are white. Tears are streaming down her face. But she keeps insisting she's fine through clenched teeth. My assistant, who's been tattooing for 15 years, keeps catching my eye with this look. Like, is this really happening? Every 30 seconds, I have to pause so she can breathe. She's doing this.

I was 13 at the zoo on free admission day with my mom and three siblings. We were having the best time. My mom had splurged on everything. Popcorn, cotton candy, candy, sodas, hot pretzels, the whole deal. We were sitting at this picnic table near the elephant exhibit, just enjoying ourselves. When I noticed my mom had stopped eating. She was staring at something. I followed her gaze to the table next to us. Four kids were sitting there. The oldest looked about my age, maybe 14. Then two middle kids and the youngest couldn't have been older than 5. They weren't eating, they weren't talking much. They were just sitting there watching us with these glances, trying not to be obvious about it. Their clothes were worn. Not dirty, but you could tell they've been washed 100 times. The kind of worn that comes from being someone's only option. The oldest girl had her arm around the youngest boy protectively. They had no food, no drinks, nothing. Just each other at that picnic table. And you could see the longing in their eyes. My mom reached into her purse and pulled out a twenty dollar Bill. She leaned close to me and whispered, honey, I need you to do something for me. She pressed the Bill into my hand. I want you to pretend you found this on the ground near their table. Give it to The oldest girl. And tell her you think she dropped it. I was confused. Why can't I just give it to her? Why do I have to pretend? My mom looked at me with this expression I'll never forget. Because charity makes people feel small. If you just hand it to her, she'll know it's pity. But if she thinks she dropped it, she gets to keep her dignity. She gets to accept help without feeling like she needed saving. Do you understand? I nodded. I got up and walked toward their table, my heart pounding. I bent down near their bench like I just spotted something on the ground. I picked up the $20, walked over to the oldest girl, and said, as casually as I could, hey, I think you dropped this. She looked at the Bill, then up at me. Her eyes went wide. No, I don't think so, I insisted. Well, I just found it right there on the ground, and I know it's not mine, so it must be yours. Stared at me for a long moment. I could see her brain working, trying to figure out what was happening. Her younger siblings had noticed. the little one was watching the twenty dollar Bill like it was magic. Like it had

Mommies need to rest. A month after giving birth, I didn't lose it. I just pulled out my phone and cancelled her flight home. But the real shock came when I saw my kids d n A's results. I am a 34 year old mechanic named Ryan Torres. I thought I knew what rock bottom felt like until last month proved me wrong. My wife Cassandra and I had been married for seven years. A month ago she gave birth to our son Tyler, or at least I thought he was ours. She had been talking about needing a break from motherhood saying she felt overwhelmed and exhausted. I got it. New babies are hard work. So when her best friend Veronica suggested a girls weekend in Miami, I told her to go. I would handle everything at home. The trip was supposed to help her decompress. Instead it destroyed everything. I was up at 3:00am with Tyler changing his diaper and warming the bottle when my phone lit up with notifications, Instagram, Facebook, text messages from my buddies at the auto shop. They all said the same thing, bro, you seeing this? Cassandra had posted a video on her Instagram Story. She was at some beachside club, music pumping, lights flashing and she was kissing some random guy full on Making out while her friends cheered and recorded. The caption read, single for the weekend. Mommies need to rest. Single for the weekend. I stood there in my living room holding my one month old son, staring at my phone and she was out there pretending to be single, kissing strangers for social media clout. I did not call her. I did not text. I just opened my phone, found her return flight confirmation in our shared email and canceled it. She called me from Veronica's phone two hours later screaming about how I had stranded her in Miami. I told her she looked pretty.

Living out of a rundown motel, I found a dusty suitcase with my name on it. Inside was $70,000 cash, a flight ticket and a note. This is just travel money. The real fortune is waiting at this address. Six months ago, I had everything, a wife I loved, a decent job and a best friend I'd known since college. Today, I'm writing this from an apartment in Seattle and I need to tell you what happened. I caught my wife, Lindsay, sleeping with my best friend Rachel. Not just a one time mistake. They've been planning it since before our wedding. When I confronted them, Lindsay looked annoyed that I'd interrupted, not guilty. Rachel actually had the nerve to say, you should have seen this coming. Everything fell apart fast. My boss, who turned out to be old friends with Lindsay, fired me two weeks later for budget cuts. The divorce judge gave her everything, our apartment, our car, our savings. I was left with a duffle bag and enough money for three months rent somewhere cheap. I bounced between friends couches for weeks before ending up at the Sunset Motel, paying by the week and eating dollar ramen for dinner. Rock bottom was real and I was living in it. Then I found the suitcase under my bed, old brown leather with my full name on the tag written in my Aunt Patricia's handwriting. She Died nine months earlier. Everyone said she was paranoid and crazy. I hadn't seen her much because family gatherings were awkward when she'd corner you with conspiracy theories. Inside was $70,000 in cash, plane ticket to Seattle and a note that made my blood run cold. This is just travel money. The real fortune is waiting at this address. Don't trust Lindsay. Don't trust Rachel. They've been planning this since before your wedding. Finish what?

Photos, testimonials, income claims. She threw parties where nobody bought anything. She messaged old high school friends, trying to recruit them. People started avoiding her. By month six, we'd spent over $15,000 on products, training courses, and convention tickets. Jessica had made about $800 in actual sales. Most of that was from her mom buying stuff out of pity. I tried talking to her about cutting losses, but she'd get defensive. Said I didn't believe in her dreams, that I was comfortable being mediocre forever. One Saturday morning, Jessica had a complete breakdown at our kitchen table. She was crying over her laptop, looking at our bank account. We were down to $400, and our mortgage was due in three days. All the money we'd saved for a down payment on a bigger house was gone. Our emergency fund was empty. Jessica looked at me with tears streaming down her face and said she'd made a terrible mistake. I thought she meant the network marketing thing, but then she brought up that phone call. Said she'd been so focused on wanting a different life that she destroyed the good one we actually had. I told her I heard what she said to Amanda that day. About unsettling, about wanting more. Jessica's face went white. She tried to apologize, but I was honestly too tired to be angry anymore. I just asked her what she wanted to do now. She Said she wanted to fix things if I let her. Jessica got her old job back at the dental office. Took them two months, but they rehired her. She sold all that inventory at a garage sale for pennies on the dollar. We spent the next year digging ourselves out of debt, living on rice and beans. No vacations, no eating out, nothing extra. The kicker, though, her friend Amanda, the one she was always jealous of, got divorced last spring. Turns out all those vacation photos were funded by maxed out credit cards. Amanda's husband had been hiding their debt for years. They lost their house in the divorce. Meanwhile, Jessica's ex, Chris, the one with all the investment properties, got sued by his tenants for unsafe living conditions and lost two of his buildings. Just Jessica saw it on the news. We're doing okay now. Not rich, but stable. Jessica tells people she's grateful for her boring teacher husband who kept us from losing everything. I'm still not sure I've completely forgiven her for what she said. But I know she regrets more than just settling. She regrets almost throwing away something real for something that was never going to make her happy anyway.

Then something shifted. She got quiet for a minute, staring at the empty glasses on our table. When she looked back up at me, her expression was different, more serious. Hey, would you mind if we split the check tonight, she asked. Her voice was careful, almost nervous. These dinners are really starting to eat into my food budget, like significantly. I just stared at her. Put a check. I would have never suggested coming out if I knew I was going to have to pay for my half. That wasn't the arrangement we had. That's not how this works. She must have seen the confusion on my face because she kept talking. You never offered to pay, not once in two years. And you always suggest going out when you know I'll be the one paying for it. I tried to defend myself. You're the one who wants to go out every week. This whole thing was your idea, not mine. Because if I didn't plan dates and pay for them, we'd never go anywhere. You'd be perfectly fine just staying home every single night, saving your money. Her voice cracked a little. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of. That stung. I wasn't taking advantage of anyone. I was just accepting what she was offering. There's a difference. I told her. Fine, we just won't go out to dinner anymore. Then problem solved. But that seemed to make her even More upset. She went completely silent, her jaw tight. When the waiter brought the check, she grabbed it before I could even see the total, total, threw her card down and didn't say another word. The Bill was $140. Apparently my portion was $95. We walked home in complete silence the entire 15 minute walk. Not a single word between us. When we got inside, she went straight to the bedroom and closed the door. I heard her crying this morning. I tried talking to her, but she barely looked at me. She said she's been thinking and maybe we're not compatible, that she can't be with someone who sees her as a free meal ticket. She even used the word breakup over 140 dollar check over asking me to split one Bill after two years of paying for everything herself without complaint. I don't understand what I did wrong here. She has more money than me anyway. These nights out don't impact her budget the way they'd impact mine. And she never said anything before. So how was I supposed to know she had a problem with it? Now she's acting like I'm some terrible boyfriend, bringing up all these random issues that have apparently been bothering her for months. None of this makes sense to me.

Landed a contract with a local restaurant chain to redesign all their menus and signage. That LED to three more restaurants wanting the same thing. Word spread fast. Within six months of Sarah leaving, I was making double what I made at my old job. I moved into my own place, nothing fancy, but it was mine. Got a gym membership and started actually using it. Lost 20 pounds, bought some new clothes that actually fit. Started going out with Tyler and his friends on weekends instead of staying home. One year after Sarah left that note, I landed my biggest client yet. A regional hotel chain wanted me to rebrand their entire image across 15 locations. Contract was worth more money than I'd made in the previous three years combined. I posted about it on LinkedIn, thanking everyone who believed in me. That post got shared like crazy. Two days later, Sarah texted me for the first time in a year. Hey, I saw your post. Congrats on the success. Can we talk? I left her on read. She texted again that night asking if I was still mad at her, said she made a mistake and wanted to explain everything. I blocked her number. Then her Instagram account sent me a DM. She'd broken up with Derek 6 months ago. Apparently his startup failed and he moved back in with his parents. She was working retail now and living with her Sister. She said she missed me and wanted to meet up to talk about giving us another shot. I blocked that account, too. A week later, she showed up at my apartment. I have no idea how she got my address. She, I was standing in the hallway crying when I opened the door, saying she was an idiot for leaving me, that I was the best thing that ever happened to her. And she threw it away. I looked at her and felt absolutely nothing. No anger, no sadness, not even satisfaction, just nothing. I told her I appreciated her coming by, but I'd moved on. I started getting desperate, saying she changed and we could start over, that we were supposed to get married. I reminded her that she's the one who left that note and walked away like I meant nothing. I said she didn't leave me because I wasn't good enough. She left because she thought she found someone with more money. And now that it didn't work out, she wanted to come back because I finally had success. That's not love. That's convenience. I tried arguing, but I closed the door. Haven't heard from her since. My business is doing better than ever and I'm dating someone new who supported me before I had anything to offer. The girl who left me a sticky note taught me the best lesson of my life.

She was talking to her friend Amanda, and I could tell from her tone. It was one of those deep conversation calls. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but then I heard my name. She said, I love David, but sometimes I wonder what my life would be like if I hadn't settled. I froze in the hallway. Amanda must have asked what she meant, because Jessica continued, like, he the good guy and everything, but he's a teacher. We're never going to be rich.

I stood there like an idiot, listening to my wife of seven years tell her friend she regretted marrying me. She kept going. Amanda's always posting pictures from her vacations, and I'm over here clipping coupons. David's happy with his little life, but I wanted more. You know, I wanted the nice house and the fancy dinners and the lifestyle. I walked back to my office and sat there staring at the wall. That night at dinner, Jessica acted completely normal, asking about my day. Talking about her co workers, laughing at some TV show. The whole time, I kept hearing those words in my head.

Her friend Tanya had recruited her to sell these wellness products. Jessica said, we can make six figures in our first year. She showed me spreadsheets and income projections.

I didn't say a word, just left them, made my move and now they are begging. I woke up on my 28th birthday to find a yellow sticky note on the bathroom mirror. The note said, I found someone better. I'm leaving. Your stuff will be at your mom's house by Friday. Sarah, we've been engaged for eight months together for four years total. I stood there in my boxers holding my toothbrush, reading that note over and over. No explanation, no phone call, just a sticky note like she was reminding me to buy milk or something. I checked the closet and half her clothes were already gone. Her makeup and hair stuff all cleared out from the bathroom counter. She packed while I was asleep and left.

I didn't cry, didn't call her, didn't blow up her phone with angry texts. I just got dressed, went to work and acted like nothing happened.

That weekend, I moved all my stuff out of our apartment. We've been splitting rent, but the lease was In her name. I crashed at my buddy Tyler's place while I figured things out. Found out through mutual friends that Sarah had been seeing this guy Derek from her gym. Apparently he owns some tech startup and drove a Tesla. That's who she thought was better than me. Instead of being bitter, I made a decision. I was a graphic designer at a mid level advertising agency making decent money but nothing special. I'd always had ideas for my own business but never had the guts to try. Sarah used to tell me it was too risky, that I should play it safe. Now I had nothing to lose. I spent the next three months working my regular job during the day and building my freelance portfolio at night. Reached out to every contact I'd ever made, offered discounted rates to small businesses that needed branding work. By month four, I had enough clients to quit my job and go full time on my own. Tyler let me stay rent free as long as I helped with groceries, which gave me runway to really focus.

I don't know why she's upset. We've been together for two years, and honestly, I thought we had a perfect system. She's amazing with money, budgets everything down to the dollar, and always has her savings together. Me? I'm working on it. I'm not broke, but saving is definitely a priority right now. Here's the thing, though. She's the one who insists we go out to dinner once a week, sometimes every other week. She says it's important for our relationship to have quality time together. I love it. We get dressed up, go somewhere nice, talk about our future, and she always looks at me like I'm the most in interesting person in the world. When the check comes, the waiter always hands it to me. I glance at it, then slide it across the table and ask, can you get this one? She always says yes. Always. Not once has she hesitated or made a face about it. So naturally, I figured this was just how we operated. She makes these dates happen, she pays for them, everyone's happy. I genuinely thought it made her feel good, like she was taking care of us, you know? Plus, she has way more saved up than I do, so it's not like the money impacts her the same way it would impact me. It just made sense. Last night, she came home exhausted. She'd spent her entire day off deep cleaning Our kitchen, reorganizing the pantry, scrubbing the oven, the works. She flopped on the couch and said she was craving appetizers and margaritas, but absolutely refused to dirty another dish. I suggested we go out. Seemed like the perfect solution. She didn't hesitate, just grabbed her purse, and we headed to our usual spot downtown. We ordered loaded nachos, wings, queso, the whole appetizer spread. Then came the margaritas. One round turned into two, then three. We were laughing, having an amazing time, talking about maybe taking a trip to Colorado next summer. I wasn't really paying attention to what we were ordering. The food kept coming, the drinks kept coming, and honestly, I was just enjoying myself. That's what these nights are for, right?

He is my best friend, but I realized I was never his best friend. I've known Gary since sophomore year. We've been tight ever since. When my ex cheated on me two years ago and broke up with me, I completely fell apart. I stopped going out, stopped caring about anything, just stayed in my room playing video games for hours and honestly doing nothing productive. Gary saw what was happening and literally saved me. He bought me a gym membership with his own money, deleted every single distraction from my laptop and even drove me to therapy appointments every week for 3 months. When I was applying for jobs last year, he stayed up until 2 in the morning helping me practice interview questions. I have my current job because of him. Everyone wants to be around Gary. He's smart, always cracking jokes, always smiling. People at work, people from college, even random people at parties, they all gravitate toward him. Our whole friend group goes to him for advice. I've gone to him dozens of times. I've cried in front of him about my ex, about my mom being sick, about feeling lost. He always listens, always knows what to say. Yesterday, we were just hanging out at the park near his apartment. Nothing special, just sitting on a bench eating burgers from that food truck he likes. We were laughing about something stupid from work. Then suddenly he just Stopped talking. His whole face changed. He started crying, not like quiet tears, full on sobbing. Then he started hitting his own head with his hands, like actually hitting himself hard. I grabbed his arms and tried to hold him still.

They ran tests, checked for parasites, did blood work. Nothing wrong. That said, maybe try different food. I tried five different brands. She'd sniff it and walk away. I was freaking out. Started reading online about force feeding cats, about feeding tubes. I was ready to spend whatever it took. Then one morning, I was sitting on the couch with toast I hadn't touched yet. I put her food bowl next to me while I stared at my plate, and she started eating. Froze. Watched her actually eat for the first time in weeks. When she finished, I managed to eat my toast, too. Tried it again at lunch. Put her bowl next to me while I had soup. She ate. Looked at me between bites, but she ate. Did it the next day, same thing. She'd only eat if I was eating at the same time, right next to her. It took me like a week to realize what happened. She Learned to only eat when I eat. I accidentally trained her to mirror my eating habits while trying to get her to stop my purging. So now we have this routine. Wake up at 7, spend two hours working up the courage to eat breakfast, sit down at 9:30 with her bowl next to mine. We eat together. Lunch at noon, same thing. Dinner at 6. She's gained weight back. Still a bit underweight, but getting better. I've been eating three meals a day for two months. Because if I don't, she won't. Then last night, I barely slept. Woke up at 9:10 and felt like garbage. The thought of food made me want to cry. I knew lunch was in a few hours. I could just wait. I put her bowl down next to me anyway. Habit. She looked at the food, looked at me, looked back at her food, then just walked away.

A few nights ago, she cornered me while I was eating and said she hated our setup. She wanted me to start eating with her and the kids and split cooking duties with her. She kept saying we were a family and family should eat together. I told her we weren't a family and I didn't want to change anything. Then she brought up the baby and tried to use them as a reason for me to give it a shot. she genuinely thought I wanted a relationship with this random baby. Told her I didn't care about the baby at all. She wouldn't drop it, so I had to rush through my food and went up to my room. But she actually followed me upstairs and kept pushing the family dinner thing. Ever since that night, she brings it up constantly and tells me she's not happy I won't try. I think she went to my dad to get him to talk to me about it, but he told her to leave it alone because I'm not part of the family they're making. Even that didn't stop her, though. Last night, she was waiting for me when I got home at 5. She. I had this whole speech prepared about how it would mean so much to her kids if I ate with them, how the baby deserves to know their brother. I'm not anyone's brother. I told her that, and she actually started crying. She said She was just trying to make a real home for everyone, and I was making it impossible. I asked her why she even cared since she didn't know the first thing about me. She paused and then asked how old I was. I told her I'm 17. Her face went white because she thought I was already 19 or 20. She'd been living in the same house as me for a year and a half and didn't even know my age. That's when I finally lost it. I told her to stop pretending she cared about me or wanted me around. This was all about her wanting to play happy family, and I wasn't interested in being part of her fantasy. He left crying, and I heard her on the phone with someone later saying I was cold and mean. My dad hasn't said anything to me about it, which means he's staying out of it, like we agreed. But now she won't even look at me when I'm in the kitchen, and her kids stare at me like I'm some kind of monster.

So I got this cat 3 years ago, normal adoption, nothing special. She was just a regular tabby who like to sleep on my laundry and knock stuff off counters. About 6 months after I got her, my eating disorder got really bad, like worse than it had been in years. I started purging again, which I hadn't done since high school. That's when she started acting weird. Every time I go to the bathroom after eating, she'd follow me in. At first, I thought she just wanted attention or was being clingy, but then she'd literally get between me and the toilet, like physically blocking me. She'd meow in my face, pot my legs, demand I pet her. I'd be crying and trying to push her away and she'd just headbut my hand and purr louder. She'd lick my face, which sounds cute but was actually really annoying when I was trying to do something. If I locked her out, she'd scream, not meow, scream so loud I was scared my neighbors would call the landlord or something. This went on for months. Eventually, I just stopped trying to purge because dealing with her was more exhausting than the actual urge. I thought I was getting better, stopped purging completely last year. But then the pandemic hit and gyms closed and I couldn't do my usual routines and everything got messy. Again, not purging, but I stopped. Eating much at all. Two months ago, my cat stopped eating, just completely stopped. Her food bowl sat there full all day. She got skinny really fast, like scary skinny. I could feel her ribs when I picked her up. I took her to the vet.

I'm 17 and I only have my dad. My mom isn't around, and I don't have any other family I can live with. My relationship with my dad has always been non existent. He resented being stuck raising me alone and never wanted to be a father. When I was younger, I wanted us to be close so badly, but he made it clear he didn't want me as his kid. We don't even call each other dad and son. We use first names. A few years ago, we made this agreement that works for both of us. I don't bother him or ask him for anything, and he doesn't expect me to do chores or be part of his life. I buy and cook my own food, clean up after myself, and basically just sleep there. I moved into the guest room so I could have my own bathroom and privacy. Nobody goes near my room or my stuff. I used to babysit to make money for food and everything else I needed. The arrangement has worked perfectly for three years now. Then, about 18 months ago, my dad's girlfriend moved in with her three kids. They got married pretty fast and had a baby together. I wasn't invited to the wedding, and I don't know anything about her kids. Not their names, not their ages, nothing. I leave every Morning at 7 and come back around 5 to cook and eat my dinner alone in the kitchen. Then I leave again and come home around 8 and in my room. Usually I'm at my friend's house or the library doing homework. My dad doesn't get home until 7:30 or 8 most nights, so I never see him. His wife and her kids eat dinner earlier and she does all the cooking for them. I figured she didn't know about our agreement because she started coming home earlier and asking me weird questions like why was I eating alone and wouldn't I rather eat with everyone else? I always said no and ignored her so I could finish eating and get out of there.

I just sat there staring at her. That's when it clicked. She'd used my gift card to buy premium chicken for her dog. Not canned food, not even regular dog food. Boneless, skinless chicken breast. The kind that costs like $8 a pound. Before I could even process this, Linda pulled out her phone and showed me pictures of her dog eating the chicken. He was so proud. Then she asked if I could give her another gift card because she was running low on food. Again. I felt my face getting hot. I asked her directly if she'd use my gift card to buy dog food. She laughed and said no. She bought people chicken for precious. Like that made it better. I told her I couldn't help her anymore. Linda's whole attitude changed instantly. Her smile dropped and she started tearing up. She said she thought I cared about her and that she really needed help. The crying felt fake, though, like she was trying to manipulate me into feeling bad. I just stood up and told her I donated to the local food pantry regularly if she needed food assistance. When I left, she called after me, but I kept walking. Later that day, I told my friend group what happened. They all said I was being harsh. They kept saying she's an elderly woman living alone and that I should be more understanding. One of Them said maybe the dog food thing was a misunderstanding, but there's no misunderstanding here. She told me she had no food. I gave her money specifically for groceries. She spent it on boneless chicken breast for her dog, then had the nerve to ask for more while showing me pictures of her dog eating my grocery money. My friends think I'm being cold, but I'm not running a dog food charity. I have no problem helping people who actually need it. I donate food and money all the time, but I'm not paying for someone's dog to eat better than I do.

We chat about plants and weather, normal neighbor stuff. A few weeks ago, Linda knocked on my door looking really upset. She told me she was having a hard time financially and barely had any food in her house. She said her Social Security check was late and she didn't know what she was going to do. I felt terrible for her. Nobody should have to worry about having enough food to eat. I asked her which grocery store she preferred and she said Aldi because it was cheaper. The next day I went and bought her a 50 dollar gift card. I figured that would get her through at least a week or two of basic groceries, rice, bean and pasta, vegetables, the essentials. Linda was so grateful when I gave it to her. She hugged me and said I was a lifesaver. She kept thanking me over and over. I felt good about helping someone in need. That's what neighbors are supposed to do for each other, right? Yesterday, Linda texted me asking if we could meet up for coffee. I thought maybe she wanted to thank me again or just catch up. We met at the coffee Shop on the corner. And she seemed in a great mood. That's when she started telling me about her week. She went on about how her dog precious had been doing so well lately. Didn't even know she had a dog. Then she said the weirdest thing. She told me she bought boneless, skinless chicken breasts at Aldi to cook for precious. Not cheap chicken, the good stuff.

My ex husband stood at my door at 2:00am sobbing uncontrollably about how his mistress had betrayed him. The same man who'd laughed when I cried about our marriage ending wanted my sympathy now. Eight months ago, my husband Trevor left me for his 26 year old yoga instructor, Jack Jasmine. We've been married 12 years, built a successful catering business. I discovered their affair through our iPad when her intimate photos synced during dinner. When confronted, Trevor blamed me, said I'd let myself go after our twins were born, that Jasmine made him feel alive and understood his need for adventure. He filed for divorce immediately, demanding I buy out his business, half or sell everything. Fought for fifty fifty custody just to reduce child support. Posted photos with Jasmine at the Maldives resort. While I was getting served divorce papers, my nine year old twins kept asking why daddy's new friend wore mommy's jewelry on Instagram. He'd been gifting her pieces from my grandmother's collection he'd claimed were lost during our move. The divorce was brutal. Trevor hired the most aggressive lawyer in town, claiming I'd been emotionally abusive by controlling his friendships. He got the house since it was his inheritance property, though I'd spent three years renovating it. I moved into a townhouse with the kids, kept the catering business running solo. While he collected monthly buyout payments, Jasmine immediately moved in, redecorated everything, and started a lifestyle blog about creating your dream space with your soulmate. She actually tagged me, thanking me for letting Trevor find true happiness. For months, I focused on rebuilding, doubled my catering contracts, started teaching cooking classes, even went on a few dates. Then last Tuesday, someone's pounding my door at 2:00am. Through the doorbell camera, I see Trevor absolutely wrecked, tears streaming. Against better judgment, I opened with the chain on. He immediately launched into his pathetic story. Jasmine had been cheating for four months with her Crossfit trainer, Antonio. But here's the beautiful part. She'd been using Trevor's money to fund Antonio's new gym and told Antonio that Trevor was just her sugar daddy, too.

It was all a boy for Herbert to enter your life. You picked up Herbert from the airport that day and have been with him ever since. The room was spin. After that trip, my boyfriend had been different. He became less confident, quieter. He'd forgotten our inside jokes. His kiss was different. The way he touched me was completely different.

He was acting differently because it was a completely different person. Jess said. Herbert was learning how to be your boyfriend, learning what you liked, trying to copy Leo's personality, but failing because he's now truly shy and anxious. For two and a/2 years, my voice cracked. I've been with a different person for two and a/2 years and no one told me. We thought you knew. Just said miserably. They're twins. We assumed you figured it out and we're okay with it. maybe you preferred Herbert's personality once you got to know him. Their friends all know. Just added. Their parents know.

His voice was warm, a little drunk. In the background, I heard someone jokingly shout, tell her Leo loves her. And a bunch of guys laughing. I hung up without saying anything. The truth was suffocating me. Every moment for the past two and a half years had been a lie. It was with the wrong twin, the boring twin who needed his brother's personality to get me. I left the party and went straight to Instagram. I found their family page and messaged their dad, their really hot dad who'd always stared at me at family reunions. I messaged him, are you free tonight? Long story short, we spent the night together and their dad, Gerbert, was better than both twins combined. No cap.

But Tom convinced me to give her another chance. The boys loved her. Finding another nanny would take months. Against my better judgment, I agreed. One morning, that was three months ago last week, I left work early with a migraine, parked down the street because contractors were blocking our driveway. Walked up to find Lauren hosting a neighborhood coffee morning in my living room. Six women from our street sitting on my couches eating cookies from my kitchen. Lauren holding court, telling them about her vacation home in Colorado, her husband's promotion, her plans to renovate the kitchen. Then she saw me through the window. Her face went white, told the women she needed to give the help instructions for dinner. Actually called me the help in my own home. I walked in through the front door. The women all stopped talking, stared at me like I was intruding. One actually asked if I could come back later to clean because they were having residents only discussion about the HOA. That's when I snapped. But I stayed calm, smiled, walked to the mantle where our wedding photos were displayed, picked up the largest one, me and my wedding dress, Tom and his tux. Beautiful wedding, wasn't it, Lauren? I said loudly. Where were you sitting again? I can't remember seeing you in any of the photos from our 2,014 wedding. The room went silent. I pulled out my phone, showed them my driver's license. Rebecca Walker Same address they were currently sitting at. Then I showed them Lauren's work visa, her nanny contract, her paysubs, every single document proving she was an employee, not the owner. The women started gathering their purses, muttering apologies, fleeing like rats. Lauren stood frozen in my living room. I called Tom, told him to come home immediately. Then I called my lawyer. Not to sue, better to report visa fraud. See, Lauren's green card application had been sponsored by us as her employers. By claiming to be the homeowner and Tom's wife, he committed fraud. Federal offense. Immigration takes that very seriously. Tom arrived to find Lauren packing frantically. She begged us not to report her, said she'd leave quietly. But the damage was done. Six neighbors thought I was the hired help in my own home. My own children were confused about who their real mother was. The lawyer filed the report that afternoon. Lauren was detained by ice two days later at the airport trying to leave the country. Her visa was revoked. She's now banned from returning to the United States for 10 years minimum. The neighbors avoid eye contact when they see me. Good. Let them sit with their embarrassment.

He had a little sister named Fenn who was my best friend. I wanted to tell him. My gut instinct told me what Natasha was doing was bad, but I was terrified. Terrified I'd lose my family over a guitar string. Then Fenn texted me, O m. G, Alexander is flying back this weekend to surprise Natasha. He wants you to help. We're picking him up from the airport Saturday and surprising her together. My hands started shaking. Saturday, that was the day Natasha told me Baylor was coming again. I texted back, hey, but I felt like I was going to throw up all week. I couldn't sleep. Saturday came. Natasha reminded me that morning, Baylor's coming at 2. Don't tell anyone. At noon, Ben and I picked up Alexander from the airport, got in the car grinning. I can't wait to see her face. She has no idea. I was sitting in the back seat, my hands and fists. Alexander kept talking. I missed her so much. I've been thinking about this for weeks. I couldn't breathe. Alexander glanced in the rearview mirror. You okay? Back there. I started crying. I couldn't, can't hold it anymore. I have to tell you something. Alexander pulled over. I told him everything. The guitar, the blackmail, Baylor coming over multiple times today. The car was silent. Alexander's hands were gripping the steering wheel. His voice was quiet. My best friend Ben was staring at me, then at her brother. Are You. Her voice was small. Are you going to fly back home? Alexander's face suddenly changed. Fly back? Hell no. He looked at both of us, confronting them. Right now, you two want to join me? We squealed. Our first stop was a party store. Alexander walked straight to the costume section, grabbed two clown masks. If they want to act like clowns, let's make it official. Then found confetti cannons. I grabbed party streamers that said congratulations. We drove to my house. I unlocked the front door. We walked upstairs in complete silence. I could hear voices in Natasha's room. Alexander didn't knock. He kicked the door open, blasted an airhorn. Natasha and Baylor jumped apart. We were standing there, three people dressed for a Celebration. Surprise, babe. Natasha's face went white. Alexander, how did you. Baylor was frozen. Dude, I can explain. Alexander walked up to Natasha, put the clown mask on her head. Since you want to act like a clown, Ben put her mask on. Baylor, I shot the confetti cannon. Congratulations on being terrible people. Confetti everywhere. Natasha ripped the mask off screaming. She pointed at me. You told them? Yeah, I did. I'm telling dad about the guitar. Alexander stepped between us. You've been blackmailing an 11 year old. She opened her mouth but nothing came out. Her face went red. Embarrassed, she looked at me and out of nowhere lunged. But Alexander blocked her. Touch her and we'll press charges. Baylor tried to Leave, but Fenn blocked the door. You're staying for this? We made them stay while Alexander recorded a video of them trying to hide under the sheets. Everyone cut them off. I eventually told dad about the guitar. He laughed. I was going to replace those anyway.

Now she's banned and deported. We hired Lauren two years ago when I went back to work at the pharmaceutical company after my second child was born. She had great references, CPR certified, spoke three languages. My husband, Tom, and I both worked demanding jobs, needed someone reliable for our boys, ages 2 and 5. Lauren was perfect, always on time, kept the house spotless, taught the kids basic French. I gave her bonuses regularly, paid her vacation time, treated her like family. She ate dinner with us most nights, had her own room in our house for when she stayed late. I even helped her get her green card sorted, wrote recommendation letters for her continuing education courses and child development. That's why what happened next was such a betrayal. It started small. The mailman mentioned how nice missus Lauren was when I collected packages one Saturday. I corrected him, said I was missus Walker. Lauren was our nanny. He looked confused but didn't say anything else. Then the pool maintenance guy if the other lady needed him to show her how to check the chemicals. What other lady? He meant me. Said Lauren had introduced herself as the homeowner and told him I was the help. Still, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe there was a language misunderstanding. Lauren's English was perfect. But maybe She mis spoke. Tom said I was being paranoid. But then our five year old Jake came home from the park upset, said his friend. Bradley's mom asked why Mommy Lauren lets the Asian nanny pick him up from school sometimes. Jake was confused, told her I was his real mommy. Bradley's mom didn't believe him, Lauren had been very clear about being married to Tom for eight years. I confronted Lauren immediately. She broke down crying, admitted she'd been telling everyone in the neighborhood she was Tom's wife because it was easier than explaining she was just the nanny. Said the neighbors were all white, wealthy, assumed any Asian woman with kids must be hired help anyway. So she just went along with their assumptions but flipped the story, made herself the wife to feel less inferior, begged me not to fire her. She loved our boys, needed this job, promised to stop. I wanted to.

In the end, she realised she was only manipulating herself. When I was 11, I picked up my dad's guitar and strummed the strings. It sounded cool, but I wanted it louder. So I strummed again really hard. This time the thinnest string snapped and hit my face. My stomach dropped. I stared at the broken string hanging limp, holding my my cheek. I started tearing up. That's when my 17 year old sister Natasha appeared in the doorway. Oh my god. Her voice was sharp. You broke Dad's guitar. I didn't mean to. He's going to freak out. She stepped closer. You know how he is about his guitar. He'll disown. Tears filled my eyes. I'm sorry. He's going to send you to the bad children home, she interrupted. You won't see us ever again. I started crying. That's when her face changed. But I won't tell him. My eyes lit up. Thank you. Thank you. Best sis. You're the best. She hugged me. But you have to do something for me in return. I pulled back. Anything. She smiled. Perfect. Someone's going to be coming to our house in an hour. Promise you won't tell anyone who? I was confused. Who's coming over doesn't matter. Do you promise or not? My heart was pounding. I promise. She smiled. Good girl. An hour later, there was a knock at the door. I opened it. Taylor was standing there. My sister's Boyfriend's best friend. Hey, he looked past me. Is Natasha here? I let him in. My stomach felt weird. They went upstairs to her room. I sat on the couch trying to understand why Alexander's best friend was here, why Natasha didn't want me to tell him. An hour later, they came down. Her hair was ruffled. Baylor left without saying much. I found Natasha in the kitchen. Why was Baylor here? She was getting water. What do you mean? Does Alexander know? Of course he knows. It's fine. But it didn't feel fine. Then why did you tell me not to tell anyone if Alexander knows? She turned to face me. Because mom and dad don't like people over when they're not home, so don't say anything to anyone. I wanted to ask more questions, but she was looking at me hard. Remember the guitar? I gulped and nodded. Baylor came over three more times over the next month. Each time, Natasha blackmailed me. I felt sick every time, especially because Alexander was perfect. He visit our family. He was nice to me. Asked about school, treated Natasha like she was the only girl in the.

I almost spit out my champagne laughing. What twin brothers? I asked. I've only been with Leo, my fiance, and he doesn't have any siblings. The entire table went silent. Everyone was looking at each other with these panicked expressions, like they knew something I didn't. You mean Leo and Herbert, my maid of honor, Jess said slowly. Your fiance and his identical twin brother. My stomach dropped. Who the hell is Herbert? Leo doesn't have any siblings. My sister grabbed Jess's arm and whispered for her to shut up, but I was already waiting for answers. Someone better explain what's going going on right now. They all kept looking at each other, trying to figure out who should talk. Finally, my friend sighed. Jess, just tell her everything, since you already started the explanation. Jess took a huge drink of her wine first. Okay, so in spring 2021, during a rooftop party, you met a guy there, right? Yeah, I met Leo, my fiance. I said, no, that wasn't Leo. It was Leo. Identical twin brother, Herbert. A twin that you never knew about? My legs felt so weak with shock that I had to sit back down. That's impossible! My husband is an only child. Just listen, Jessa. The guy you met at that party was Herbert's twin brother, Leo. Leo was the confident one, the Charming one. My hands were shaking. Now you're telling me that wasn't Herbert? Herbert is the shy twin, Jess continued. But from the moment Leo brought you around, Herbert was obsessed with you. He'd watch you guys from a distance, just waiting for you to break up so he could swoop in and be with you instead. This is insane, I said. But they kept going. By August 2,021, Leo was done with you. Just said. It's what he does. He dates girls for a few months until he gets bored, then ghost them. He was already talking to some girl from his

I don't have your kids. They've never been here. He made a sound halfway between a scream and a sob. I put them in a taxi Thursday morning.

Where were they? Three days at a stranger's house. But I gave your address. Wrong address. And you never followed up? Never confirmed arrival. Just assumed. Excuses started. He'd been busy. The trip was booked. You need to leave tomorrow. We're explaining to child services why you ship children to someone who said no. You're ruining my life. Over a mistake. You made it. I'm documenting it. Monday, I contacted CPS. Full timeline, police reports, statements. Investigation opened immediately. Olivia had no idea. Isaac told her the kids were with his parents. Sent old photos. Finding out they've been lost three days while he lied broke her. She moved out within a week. Filed for separation. Court was brutal. Isaac claimed vindictive. His lawyer called it honest error. The judge disagreed. Children under 8 sent alone with no verification, no follow up for 72 hours. Criminal negligence. Isaac lost custody. Supervised visitation only. Olivia won full custody. Isaac got every other weekend, supervised child support. And a criminal record. Lost his job over child endangerment charges. Six months later, Isaac called from different numbers. Voicemails. About how I destroyed his life. I saved them, but never responded. I didn't destroy his life. He did when he chose convenience over safety. Years later, Marie's 14, wants to be a lawyer. Owen's 12, into computers. Thriving with Livia. Isaac tried reconnecting recently. They're not interested. Old enough to understand, old enough to choose. I'm just the aunt who said no and meant it.

That's when I actually started paying attention to the apartment. The bottle of fabric softener I bought last month was half empty. The expensive hospital grade kind I get from work, $40 a bottle because it's hypoallergenic and removes biological contaminants. I'm the only one who does laundry at 2:00am after my shifts. The building's laundry room is empty. At that hour, it's the only time I can go. But that bottle was definitely half empty. Now I checked my detergent, too, also half gone. I started thinking about the timing. Mia's complaint started exactly two weeks ago, right when I bought that new fabric softener. Sunday night, I set up my old phone in the laundry room, propped it on top of the detergent shelf, camera facing the machines, hit record and left. I worked my usual overnight shift at the hospital, came home at 6:00am, exhausted, downloaded the footage, fast forwarded through hours of nothing, empty machines, dark room. Then at 3:00am, the lights flipped on. Mia walked in wearing pajamas, carrying a laundry basket. She went straight to the shelf, picked up my bottle of fabric softener, my detergent, poured a full cap of softener into the washer, added the detergent, started loading her clothes. She'd been using my expensive hospital grade products for weeks. The chemical smell she kept complaining about was literally just the smell of actually clean clothes. My stuff costs 10 times what regular detergent costs because it's designed to remove bloodborne Pathogens and hospital contamination. It's industrial strength. She'd been stealing my supplies, using them on her own laundry, then accusing me of tampering with her clothes. I watched the whole video. She even checked the hallway twice to make sure nobody saw her. I sent the video to the group chat with one message, found the thief. Casey called her immediately. I could hear Mia's voice through the wall getting defensive. I thought it was communal. It was just sitting there. Brandon replied in the chat, it was on the shelf labeled with her name. Mia tried claiming she didn't see the label, that she was half asleep, that it was an honest mistake. I sent another message. Two weeks, not a mistake. Casey knocked on my door an hour later. I'm sorry. I believed her. That's insane. Mia avoided me for three days, wouldn't make eye contact, stayed in her room. Then I got a text from our landlord asking about the Wi Fi password. Apparently Mia told him she couldn't remember it. I changed it that night. She could buy her own internet. Two weeks later, Mia's mom showed up with a U Haul. Casey told me later that Mia owed $300 in utility bills she never paid.

So he dumped them in a taxi to my address anyway. Except the driver got it wrong. Three days later, I got the call that destroyed him. My brother Isaac believed his problems automatically became my emergencies. For four years, babysitting requests expanded. Hours became days, days became weekends, weekends became constant emergencies. Isaac's surprise work trips were golf weekends. Livia's emergency appointments were spa days. They assumed I wouldn't question family. Three weeks before my first vacation in 18 months, I sent a group text off completely. March 15th to 22nd. Phone on Silent. Isaac responded with a thumbs up. Three days before vacation, he called. The kids can stay with you Thursday, right? Since you're free anyway? No, I have plans. You're staying home doing nothing? The answer is no. He exploded. You're selfish. You're destroying our marriage. When are you going to act like family? Isaac, I've babysat 60 times in two years. I'm being unavailable, not selfish. It's one week to save my marriage. No. Find other childcare. He hung up. Guilt text flooded in from mom, dad, Olivia. I didn't respond. Thursday morning, I woke up naturally. Made breakfast. Pure peace. I didn't know was Isaac had decided to force it anyway. He called a taxi at 9:00am, put Marie, 7, and Owen, 5, in the back with a small bag. No note, no call. Just shipped them. But Isaac mixed up my address. I live at 18 47 Maple street, he told the driver. 14 87 Maple street, 4 miles away. The taxi dropped two children at a random house and left. Helen was gardening when she found two confused kids on her curb. She assumed they were at the wrong house. Their parents would realise any minute. Nobody came. Helen brought them inside, gave them juice and cookies. The kids knew they were going to Aunt Nat's, but didn't know my address or last name. Evening came. No parents. She made dinner, set up her guest room. Friday passed. Then Saturday. 72 hours in a stranger's house. Saturday evening

Missus Chen had a phone graveyard in her desk drawer, and she was obsessed. If she saw the outline of a phone in your pocket, that was confiscation. If your phone vibrated in your backpack across the room, that was confiscation. If you even glanced at where your phone might be, she'd swoop down and demand you hand it over. The woman had been teaching AP history for 15 years and spent every single one building her reputation as the phone Nazi. John's phone slipped from his pocket when he grabbed his pencil. Missus Chen snatched it while her own Instagram feed glowed on her desk. During Abigail's Holocaust presentation, Missus Chen never looked up from scrolling and double tapping. Abigail's voice cracked, but missus Chen kept texting. When Matthew had his new iPhone out, she walked past him to confiscate Maria's slip phone instead. Some students know how to be discreet. She said she once spent 20 minutes reading through a confiscated phone, but we could see her gasping at screenshots of breakup texts. When the fire alarm malfunctioned three times in a row, we were all terrified. But Missus Chen banned us from texting our worried parents, even though she herself was clearly typing away in a group chat. Everything changed the day my mom had a work emergency. She texted me that morning saying she might need me to Pick up my little sister from elementary school if her meeting ran late. I kept my phone on silent and face down on the corner of my desk while I took notes. Missus Chen walked by during her patrol and snatched it without warning. I tried to explain about my sister, but she cut me off. You should have thought about that before you broke the rules. She dropped my phone in the drawer and turned the lock with a little flourish. My eight year old sister had to wait outside her school for an hour. She sat on the curb crying because she thought everyone had forgotten about her. A teacher finally called my mom's office and they tracked her down. By the time my mom got there.

My friend Jake surveyed the increasingly empty apartment. This is brutal, they said. I contribute nothing. I'm just proving them right. Their belongings fit in small piles in the center of each room. One TV, one floor lamp and scattered makeup products. I even powered on the TV they and so protective of and logged out of my Netflix account. Now it was all theirs, a black screen with nothing to watch. I took videos and photos of everything, texted them to Patricia with receipts attached, leaving today. This is everything I'm taking, all purchased by me. Here's documentation. Keys will be with you by five PM six hours after we started, my room was empty. The common areas were bare and their stuff sat in sad little islands on the hardwood floor. Everything they taken for granted was gone. The apartment echoed. I dropped my keys with Patricia in person. She looked at the receipts on her iPad, then at me. They told me you didn't contribute anything. Apparently furniture doesn't count. She smiled. They're going to need your room filled in me or they'll have to cover your abortion. That's $900 each extra per month. Good luck to them, I said. They won't find anyone, Patricia said quietly. Monday night, my phone exploded with locked numbers. I blocked them everywhere. But they were trying. From friends, phones, texting apps, even email. Hundreds of messages, accusations, threats, begging I didn't open a single one. Patricia forwarded me their panicked messages. She stole everything. The apartment is empty. This is illegal. Patricia's response was beautiful. According to her receipts, the photo she provided before leaving, she only took items she purchased. You have until the end of the month to find someone for the third room or you'll need to cover her rent. They tried finding someone for my room. But complaining about their ex roommate to every potential tenant isn't great marketing. By day 20, they still haven't found anyone. And Patricia had already started making calls. She knew every landlord in our college town because they met monthly for coffee and shared information about problem tenants. Difficult tenants, she told them, blamed their responsible roommate for everything. Couldn't make rent. Started drama with everyone. When the sisters couldn't come up with my portion of the rent, Patricia started the eviction process. They had 2 weeks to come up with the money or get out. Their apartment hunt went exactly as expected. Every application came back with the same responses. Sorry, just rented to someone else. We're going with other tenants. Your application wasn't selected. They wanted me to contribute nothing. Wish granted. Now they know exactly what nothing looks like.

Mia grabbed the sweater back. My jeans, my shirts, even my towels. You're using some weird chemical on them. I don't even do my laundry here. I drop it off at the wash and fold, right? Sure. She stormed back to her room and slammed the door. Three days later, she installed a lock on her bedroom door, a real dead bolt. Then she posted in our apartment group chat that I was Stealing her clothes and ruining them with chemicals. Casey responded immediately with a shocked emoji. That's so messed up.

Mia told our landlord I was damaging her property. He sent me an email asking if we needed to have a formal meeting about respecting boundaries. I was being painted as some kind of creep who snuck into rooms and contaminated people's belongings.

I paused my Netflix show and looked up. Megan stood in the doorway with her backpack still on and Ashley hovered behind her, both of them wearing that weird synchronized glare they always got when they rehearsed something together. I do live here, I said, pausing my show. You're always out here using the TV, the couch, Ashley said. You contribute nothing to this place, but you sure act like you own it. I looked between them and noticed how they glanced at each other like this was all rehearsed. I decided not to engage. Okay. I grabbed my laptop and headed to my room. I figured they had a bad day, maybe bombed a test or something. Whatever it was, I'd let it blow over. Except 10 minutes later, Megan knocked once and opened my door without waiting for an answer.

The door closed before I could respond. For eight months, I've been quietly furnishing our place, buying household items, covering utilities when they were short. I never made a big deal about it, but apparently I was the problem. The next day, I was in my room when I heard them in the kitchen. Patricia totally believed us. Megan said I told her she's hostile and refuses to contribute. Ashley laughed and I reminded her we were here first so we get final say on who stays. Within an hour, Patricia called me. The girls think it's not working out. Maybe you should start looking for a new place. They want me gone. I asked. They've been here longer. They're saying you're difficult. I paid rent early every single month. Never a complaint from neighbors, but sure, I was the difficult one. I understand. I told Patricia. I'll handle it. I spent the next few days planning. That weekend Megan announced they were going to their cousin's wedding upstate, three day weekend. They'd be leaving Friday morning, back Monday night. Perfect Friday at 9:00am, their car disappeared around the corner. By 9:15, I had three friends with trucks pulling up. By noon, we were in full operation mode. The cow they've been sprawled on every night, mine bought it off Facebook Marketplace. Still have the messages. The kitchen table where Megan loved hosting her friends. IKEA receipt in my email. Assembled it myself with my dad when I moved in. So I just took the Wi-Fi router because my name was on the account. The shower curtain and bathroom rug from my Amazon orders. Every kitchen appliance because I'd slowly been the one replacing broken items. The coffee maker, the toaster, the Instant Pot, even the living.

Three Months later, we hosted Thanksgiving. They came with wine and apologies. Never admitted I should have asked for advice instead of money. Hannah confessed. I was jealous. I wanted to believe your life wasn't as good as it looked. Mom said I couldn't accept that. You're an adult with a separate life. Hannah stopped by weeks later. What I did was beyond wrong. Maybe we could try being sisters again. The kind who are careful but still care. Maybe. But it'll take time. The revenge we took wasn't flashy. We refused to be victims and protected what we built. Trust rebuilt slowly. Some wounds healed, some left scars. We were happy because we chosen each other and defended that choice when threatened. The greatest revenge is refusing to let other people's desperation become your emergency.

I sent one message to the group chat. I forgive you. But forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting. You're ready for a real relationship with me, not my money. I'll be here until then. I need space. It's been two years. My mom showed up one Sunday holding a casserole dish. I'm sorry. Not because you have money. I'm sorry because you're right. I let her in with conditions. They've been trying showing up consistently, actually asking about Emma. They're learning what it means to be present.

But when they saw me gifting my wife 150 thousand dollar BMW SUV on Instagram, Mom called. Sunday dinner, emergency meeting. So I arrived with a surprise. Emma was born Tuesday at 6:00am emergency C section. My hands shook so hard I thought I'd break Rebecca's fingers. I called my mom at 6:35. She didn't answer. She responded four hours later. Wonderful news. Nobody asked if we needed anything. Rebecca's parents arrived by noon with soup, flowers, tears. They stayed three days, change diapers, held Emma so we could sleep. My family visited Saturday Four days later. They stayed 45 minutes. My dad fell asleep. Vanessa stayed on her phone. A week later scrolling Instagram. At 2:00am while feeding Emma, I saw it. Vanessa's spa weekend photos dated Tuesday, February 14th. The same Tuesday my daughter was born. The same Tuesday Rebecca was in emergency surgery. The same Tuesday I called my mom and she didn't answer because she was getting champagne and seaweed wraps. Caption read, mom needed this after such a stressful month. My mom had commented, best daughter ever. You always know what I need. Something inside me hardened into something cold. And I've been building an app for 3 years Stream Wise, a productivity platform. I showed my dad once. He watched 3 Minutes. It's a cute hobby, but don't quit your day job. Didn't know his own company was struggling with the exact problem my app solved. Watched him complain about it for months. I kept building, got rejected 47 times. Then 3 months after Emma was born, I got a call. We want to acquire your app. 1.2 million plus $180,000 annually for 3 years. The firm, they just signed my dad's company as their first major client. I cried. We can breathe. We paid off $63,000 in student loans in one payment. Built a two year emergency fund, bought a house in cash. I didn't tell my family. Six months passed. Then Mother's Day came. I bought Rebecca the BMW X5.

This time my stomach dropped. No one knew the results of that test but me. I was eight months pregnant with our second when my husband's family threw us a surprise dinner at their house. The dining room was decorated with blue and pink balloons. His sister Morgan kept refilling my water while everyone laughed about baby names and made predictions. Then Brandon made that joke about C sections. The room kept buzzing with conversation, but everything went silent in my head. I set down my glass carefully. I smiled. Actually, vaginal this time. Doctor cleared me last week. Brandon's face drained of color. Wait, what? I thought? The table went quiet. My husband squeezed my hand under the table, clearly confused about why this mattered. Brandon, his wife, Melissa, hissed, ripping his arm. My mind was racing. My first pregnancy ended in an emergency C section after 31 hours of labor. It was traumatic. I hemorrhaged and two days in intensive care while my Newborn was in the NICU. Only four people knew the full details, me, my husband, my OB and the hospital staff. We'd kept most of it private because his family had opinions about everything. They'd already criticized my birth plan, my hospital choice, even my decision to get an epidural. I never told them about the complications. Neither did my husband. How did Brandon know I'd had a C section? I pulled Out my phone slowly opened my medical portal app, the one that's linked to my husband's insurance. So he has shared access to view bills and appointments. Babe, I said, keeping my voice steady. When did you last check your email? The one connected to the insurance portal? He looked at me confused this morning. Why? I navigated to the settings, clicked on Shared Access, and there it was. I turned the screen toward him. Shared access notification added user Brandon Harris at Techcorp. Com. Access granted May 3rd, Three months ago. My husband stared at the screen. What the hell, Brandon?

He said his mom was just anxious about the baby and trying to help. He asked me to give her a break, so I did. The next morning, I woke up to voices downstairs. Diane was on the phone talking to someone. I heard her say my name, so I stopped on the stairs to listen. She was telling whoever it was that I wasn't eating enough and the baby was measuring small, both lies. She said Greg was worried about me but didn't know how to say it, also a lie. Then she said maybe they should consider taking the baby after it was born because I clearly wasn't stable enough to be a mother. She said my anxiety medication proved I had mental problems. I walked down and asked who she was talking to. She hung up fast and said it was her sister. I asked why she was lying about me. She said she wasn't lying and that I was being paranoid. I told her to get out of my house. She refused and she promised Greg she'd take care of me and she wasn't leaving. I called Greg at work and told him what happened. He came home early. Diane told him I was being hormonal and irrational. She actually used those words. Greg asked what the phone call was about. She said I was making it up. I grabbed her phone off the counter and opened her recent Calls. The last one was to Child Protective Services. I just stared at the screen. She'd actually called CPS on me while living in my house. Greg lost it, started yelling at her, asking what she was thinking. Diane said she was protecting her grandchild from an unfit mother. She brought up the medication again and said I'd been acting erratic. Greg told her to pack her stuff and leave. She tried arguing, but he wasn't hearing it. She packed up crying and saying we'd regret this. She was only trying to help. She left and I just sat there shaking. Two days later, a CPS worker showed up. Someone had filed a report claiming I was abusing drugs and planning to neglect the baby. They interviewed me and Greg checked the house, looked at my medical records. The whole thing was humiliating. The worker figured out pretty quick it was bogus and closed the case. But it's on file now forever.

She kept texting me asking about doctor appointments and if I needed anything. Thought she was just excited to be a grandma. At 7 months, I went into early labor. The doctor stopped it but put me on bed rest. Greg had to go back to work after a week, so Diane offered to stay with me. She took time off her job and drove down with like four suitcases. I figured she was just being helpful. First few days were fine. She made food and did laundry. But then I noticed she kept going through my stuff. I caught her in our bedroom closet one morning looking through boxes. She said she was looking for extra blankets. Okay, whatever. Then my pills started going missing. I had anxiety medication I've been taking for years. The bottle was in the bathroom cabinet and suddenly half of them were gone. I asked Diane if she'd seen them. She said no and helped me look. We never found them. I had to call my doctor for an early refill. We 2 she Started getting weird about the nursery. We'd set it up before the bed rest and she kept saying we did it wrong. The crib was in the wrong spot. The changing table was too close to the window. She moved stuff around when I was sleeping. Greg told her to stop, but she said she knew better since she'd raised two kids. Then I found her going through my phone. I'd left it charging in the kitchen and walked in on her scrolling through my messages. She jumped and said she thought it was hers. Her phone was literally in her hand. I told.

After my shifts, the building's laundry room is empty. At that hour, it's the only time I can go. But that bottle was definitely half empty. Now I checked my detergent, too. Also half gone. I started thinking about the timing. Mia's complaint started exactly two weeks ago. Right when I bought that new fabric softener. Sunday night, I set up my old phone in the laundry room, propped it on top of the detergent shelf, camera facing the machines. Record, and left. I worked my usual overnight shift at the hospital. Came home at 6 a m. Exhausted. Downloaded the footage, fast forwarded through hours of nothing. Empty machines, dark room. Then at 3:47 a m, the lights flipped on. Mia walked in, wearing pajamas, carrying a laundry basket. She went straight to the shelf, picked up my bottle of fabric softener, my detergent. Poured a full cap of softener into the washer, added the detergent, started loading her clothes. She'd been using my expensive hospital grade products for weeks. The chemical smell she kept complaining about was literally just the smell of actually clean clothes. My stuff costs 10 times what regular detergent costs because it's designed to remove bloodborne pathogens and hospital contamination. It's industrial strength. She been stealing my supplies, using them on her own laundry, then accusing me of tampering with her clothes. I watched the whole video. She even checked the hallway twice to make sure nobody saw her. I sent The video to the group chat with one message. Found the thief. Casey called her immediately. I could hear Mia's voice through the wall, getting defensive. I thought it was communal. It was just sitting there. Brandon replied in the chat. It was on the shelf labeled with her name. Mia tried claiming she didn't see the label, that she was half asleep, that it was an honest mistake. I sent another message. Two weeks. Not a mistake. Casey knocked on my door an hour later. I'm sorry. I believed her. That's insane. Mia avoided me for three days. Wouldn't make eye contact, stayed in her room. Then I got a text from our landlord asking about the Wi Fi password. Apparently, Mia told him she couldn't remember it. I changed it. That night. She could buy her own internet. Two weeks later, Mia's mom showed up with a U Haul. Casey told me later that Mia owed $300 in utility bills she never paid.

She went silent when she found out why everything she owned smelled like chemicals. Mia cornered me in the kitchen Tuesday morning, holding one of her sweaters at arm's length. This freaks. What did you do to it? I didn't borrow it. I barely leave my room. Stop lying. Everything I own smells like a lab explosion. She threw the sweater at me. Touch my stuff again and you're out. I work night shifts at the hospital as a lab tech. When I'm home, I'm sleeping. I don't have time to steal clothes. But she wouldn't listen. You're the only one who could have done this. Casey doesn't touch my things. Casey's our third roommate. She was sitting at the table eating cereal, watching the whole thing. I picked up the sweater and smelled it. It smelled clean, like really clean. The kind of clean that costs money. I seriously have no idea what you're talking about. Then why does every single thing in my closet smell like this? Mia grabbed the sweater back. My jeans, my shirts, even my towels. You're using some weird chemical on them. I don't even do my laundry here. I drop it off at the wash and fold, right? Sure. She stormed back to her room and slammed the door. Three days later, she installed a lock on her bedroom door, a real dead bolt. Then she posted in our apartment group chat that I was Stealing her clothes and ruining them with chemicals. Casey responded immediately with a shocked emoji. That's so messed up. My other roommate, Brandon, just replied, yikes. Nobody asked for my side. That weekend, Casey stopped talking to me. She'd leave rooms when I entered. Brandon started locking his door, too. Mia told our landlord I was damaging her property. He sent me an email asking if we needed to have a formal meeting about respecting boundaries. I was being painted as some kind of creep who snuck into rooms and contaminated people's belongings. That's when I actually started paying attention to the apartment. The bottle of fabric softener I bought last month was half empty. The expensive hospital grade kind I get from work, $40 a bottle because it's hypoallergenic and removes biological contaminants. I'm the only one who does laundry.

I've known Linda for about five years now. She lives in the apartment building next to mine and we met at the community garden. She's in her 70s and always seem nice enough. We chat about plants and weather, normal neighbor stuff. A few weeks ago, Linda knocked on my door looking really upset. She told me she was having a hard time financially and barely had any food in her house. She said her Social Security check was late and she didn't know what she was going to do. I felt terrible for her. Nobody should have to worry about having enough food to eat. I asked her which grocery store she preferred and she said Aldi because it was cheaper. The next day I went and bought her a 50 dollar gift card. I figured that would get her through at least a week or two of basic groceries, rice, beans, pasta, vegetables, the essentials. Linda was so grateful when I gave it to her. She hugged me and said I was a lifesaver. She kept thanking me over and over. I felt good about helping someone in need. That's what neighbors are supposed to do for each other, right? Yesterday, Linda texted me asking if we could meet up for coffee. I thought maybe she wanted to thank me again or just catch up. We met at the coffee shop On the corner and she seemed in a great mood. That's when she started telling me about her week. He went on about how her dog precious had been doing so well lately. I didn't even know she had a dog. Then she said the weirdest thing. She told me she'd bought boneless skinless chicken breasts at Aldi to cook for precious. Hot, cheap chicken, the good stuff. She was going on about how precious loved it and how much healthier it was than dog food. I just sat there staring at her. That's when it clicked. She'd used my gift card to buy premium chicken for her dog, not canned food, not even regular dog food. Boneless skinless chicken breast, the kind that costs like $8 a pound. Before I could even process this, Linda pulled out her phone and showed me pictures of her dog eating the chicken. She was so proud. Then she asked if I could give her another gift card because she was running low on food. Again, I felt my face getting hot. I asked her directly if she'd use my gift card to buy dog food. She laughed and said, no, she bought people chicken for precious, like that made it better. I told her I couldn't help her anymore. Linda's whole attitude changed instantly. Her smile dropped and she started tearing up. She said she thought I cared about her and that she really needed help. The crying felt fake, though, like She was trying to manipulate me into feeling bad. I just stood up and told her I donated to the local food pantry regularly if she needed food assistance. Then I left. She called after me, but I kept walking. Later.

The door closed before I could respond. For eight months, I've been quietly furnishing our place, buying household items, covering utilities when they were short. I never made a big deal about it, but apparently I was the problem. The next day, I was in my room when I heard them in the kitchen. Patricia totally believed us. Megan said I told her she's hostile and refuses to contribute. Ashley laughed and I reminded her we were here first so we get final say on who stays. Within an hour, Patricia called me. The girls think it's not working out. Maybe you should start looking for a new place. They want me gone. I asked. They've been here longer. They're saying you're difficult. I paid rent early every single month. Never a complaint from neighbors, but sure I was the difficult one. I understand. I told Patricia. I'll handle it. I spent the next few days planning.

The door closed before I could respond. For eight months, I've been quietly furnishing our place, buying household items, covering utilities when they were short. I never made a big deal about it, but apparently I was the problem. The next day, I was in my room when I heard them in the kitchen. Patricia totally believed us. Megan said. I told her she's hostile and refuses to contribute. Ashley laughed, and I reminded her we were here first, so we get final say on who stays. Within an hour, Patricia called me. The girls think it's not working out. Maybe you should start looking for a new place. They want me gone? I asked. They've been here longer. They're saying you're difficult. I paid rent early every single month. Never a complaint from neighbors. But sure, I was the difficult one. I understand. I told Patricia. I'll handle it. I spent the next few days planning that weekend. Megan announced they were going to their cousin's wedding upstate. Three day weekend. They'd be leaving Friday morning, back Monday night. Perfect. Friday at 9:00am, their car disappeared around the corner. By 9:15, I had three friends with trucks pulling up. By noon, we were in full operation mode.

Then she sued me. Wrongful eviction, emotional distress, business interference, $92,000 in damages. Her story, I promised housing indefinitely, then cruelly revoked it over a minor birthday disagreement. I documented everything. Then a letter arrived, handwritten, no return address. I know what Amber did. You deserve to know everything. Call me. Signed, Elijah Hunter's father, the man she claimed abandoned them, the man she'd erased. I called. He'd never left. She'd kicked him out after her wedding business tanked, using his savings. When he tried for custody, she threatened to claim abuse. He backed down, terrified. But he'd been watching, waiting. That cake thing, he said, that's Learned behavior. Maybe it's time I stopped being afraid. We met. He had records, emails, bank statements, proof she'd been collecting child support through a shell account, filing under a friend's name while claiming single mom hardship. Dana smiled. We're not just defending, we're exposing. Court day, Amber strutted in late, sunglasses on, no lawyer. The judge asked for documentation, lease agreements, proof of ownership. She had nothing. Dana submitted everything. Ownership docs, fraud evidence, Elijah's affidavit about false custody claims. When Elijah stood from the back row, Amber went ghost white. You don't get to talk, she choked out. You abandoned. No, Elijah said calmly. You pushed me out, threatened to destroy me if I fought back. The judge reviewed the paperwork, looked at Amber. Miss Wallace, this eviction is valid. You have 60 days. She Asked, what am I supposed to do that, the judge said, is outside this court's scope. The rest unraveled fast. City auditors investigated her daycare fraud. Her friend confessed to the shell custody account. Elijah 1 supervised visitation. When hunter saw his dad for the first time in years, he didn't scream or hide. He just asked softly, do you like dinosaurs? Amber's Facebook vanished. The smear campaigns stopped. I rebuilt quietly. Max started soccer. We cleaned the green frosting stain off the patio. A faint tint still catches sunlight. The last time I saw Amber was outside the courthouse. She looked at me tired, cracked. I hope you're happy, she said. I didn't smile. I'm finally honest. She turned away. I didn't lose a sister. I stopped losing myself.

My friend Jake surveyed the increasingly empty apartment. This is brutal, they said. I contribute nothing. I'm just proving them right. Their belongings fit in small piles in the center of each room. One TV, one floor lamp and scattered makeup products. I even powered on the TV they've been so protective of and logged out of my Netflix account. Now it was all theirs, a black screen with nothing to watch. I took videos and photos of everything, texted them to Patricia with receipts attached, leaving to today. This is everything I'm taking, all purchased by me. Here's documentation. Keys will be with you by five PM six hours after we started, my room was empty. The common areas were bare and their stuff sat in sad little islands on the hardwood floor. Everything they taken for granted was gone. The apartment echoed. I dropped my keys with Patricia in person. She looked at the receipts on her iPad, then at me. They told me you didn't contribute anything. Apparently furniture doesn't count. She smiled. They're going to need your room filled immediately or they'll have to cover your abortion. That's $900 each extra per month. Good luck to them, I said. They won't find anyone, Patricia said quietly. Monday night, my phone exploded with locked numbers. I blocked them everywhere. But they were trying. From friends, phones, texting, apps, even email. Hundreds of messages, accusations, threats, begging. I didn't open a Single one. Patricia forwarded me their panicked messages. She stole everything. The apartment is empty. This is illegal. Patricia's response was beautiful. According to her receipts and the photos she provided before leaving, she only took items she purchased. You have until the end of the month to find someone for the third room or you'll need to cover her rent. They tried finding someone for my room, but complaining about their ex roommate to every potential tenant isn't great marketing. By day 20, they still hadn't found anyone and Patricia had already started making calls. She knew every landlord in our college town because they met monthly for coffee and shared information about problem tenants, faulty tenants, she told them. Blamed their responsible roommate for everything. Couldn't make rent. Started drama with everyone. When the sisters couldn't come up with my portion of the rent, Patricia started the eviction process. They had 2 weeks to come up with the money or get out. Their apartment hunt went exactly as expected. Every application came back with the same responses. Sorry, just rented to someone else. We're going with other tenants. Your application wasn't selected. They wanted me to contribute nothing. Wish granted. Now they know exactly what nothing looks like.

Turned out fostering me meant she lost her spare bedroom income room I was sleeping in. She'd been renting it out for three years. That was $400 a month. She didn't have anymore. She never mentioned it to me. Month three, I overheard her talking to my case worker. How's it going, the woman asked. She's doing great, really great. And you honestly? Rachel paused. It's hard, but she's worth it. I pressed my ear against my bedroom door. The 90 days will be up soon. Have you thought about extending every single day? Rachel said, but I don't want her to feel trapped or obligated. She needs to know this was her choice, too. My stomach dropped. I thought she was keeping me, thought I'd finally found somewhere stable. The 90 days ended on a Tuesday. I packed my bag that morning before school, hands shaking, left it by my bedroom door. Rachel saw it when I got home, face fell. You're leaving. Isn't that the deal? Ninety days. She sat down at the kitchen table, looked smaller than I'd ever seen her. That was the deal, she said quietly, but I was hoping we could change it. She slid a new paper across the table. New contract, no end date, same rules, but you're family now. Not temporary, permanent. I look at the paper. My name was already filled in under daughter. The date at the Top is from week two. You planned this? I hoped for it. The 90 days wasn't a trial period for you. And what was it? She met my eyes. It was for me to prove I could do it right, that I wouldn't give up when things got hard, that I'd choose you every single day, even when it cost me. I looked at that paper, at my name and her handwriting, at the word daughter. What if I mess up, I asked. Then we'll fix it together. I signed the paper. She put it in a frame and hung it in the hallway. Three years later, I graduated high school. She was in the front row. Last year, I finished my first year of college. She still text me every morning, still sends notes. The schedule still on my childhood bedroom door.

I didn't know she was about to raise me better than my own parents ever did. I was 16 when child services called her. My mom had been arrested again, third time that year. My aunt Rachel didn't hesitate, but she had conditions. The schedule was brutal. Wake up 6:00am, eat breakfast, 30 minutes exercise, school, two hours homework before dinner, chores, rotation, lights out. Ten PM, no exceptions. This isn't a vacation, she said. You follow the rules or you leave. I arrived with one duffle bag and an attitude. My whole life had been chaos. Mom's boyfriends rotating through our apartment, eviction notices, dinner from gas stations. Structure felt like punishment. Week 1, I tested every boundary, stayed up past 10, left dishes in the sink. I finished my homework. Rachel didn't yell. She just pointed to the schedule taped on my bedroom door. Day seven, she said, 83 to go. She checked my homework like a drill sergeant, made me redo a whole essay because I didn't try. I told her she wasn't my real mom. She nodded and said, you're right. Real moms let you fail. I won't. Week two, I skipped the morning exercise, found her waiting at my bedroom door at 6:15 with running shoes. We can go together or you can go alone, but you're going. We ran two miles in silence. She Didn't lecture, just ran beside me. Week three, something shifted. She drove 40 minutes each way so I could stay at my old school. Never complained, never mentioned the gas money. She packed my lunch every morning with notes inside. You've got this or proud of you or bad days don't last. My friend Becca noticed your aunt makes your lunch. That's so weird. I shrugged, but I started keeping the notes. Week 5, I got a C on a history test. Hid it in my backpack. She found it doing laundry. We're fixing this, she said. Every night that week, she sat with me at the kitchen table, quizzed me on dates, battles, treaties. She taught elementary school for 20 years before switching to nursing. She knew how to make things stick. I got a B on the next test. She put it on the fridge.

I didn't know she was about to raise me better than my own parents ever did. I was 16 when child services called her. My mom had been arrested again. Third time that year. My aunt Rachel didn't hesitate. But she had conditions. Schedule was brutal. Wake up 6:00am, make breakfast, 30 minutes exercise, school. Two hours homework before dinner. Chores, rotation. Lights out, ten PM. No exceptions. This isn't a vacation, she said. You follow the rules or you leave. I arrived with one duffel bag and an attitude. My whole life had been chaos. Mom's boyfriends rotating through our apartment, eviction notices, dinner from gas stations. Structure felt like punishment. Week one, I tested every boundary, stayed up past 10, left dishes in the sink. I finished my homework. Rachel didn't yell. She just pointed to the schedule taped on my bedroom door. Day seven, she said, eighty three to go. She checked my homework like a drill sergeant. Made me redo a whole essay because I didn't try. I told her she wasn't my real mom. She nodded and said, you're right. Real moms let you fail. I won't. Week two, I skipped the morning exercise, found her waiting at my bedroom door at 6:15 with running shoes. We can go together or you can go alone. But you're going. We ran two miles in silence. She Didn't lecture. Just ran beside me. Week three, something shifted. She drove 40 minutes each way so I could stay at my old school. Never complained, never mentioned the gas money. She packed my lunch every morning with notes inside. You've got this or proud of you or bad days don't last. My friend Becca noticed. Your aunt makes your lunch? That's so weird. I shrugged. But I started keeping the notes. Week 5, I got a C on a history test. Hid it in my backpack. She found it doing laundry. We're fixing this, she said. Every night that week, she sat with me at the kitchen table. Quizzed me on dates, battles, treaties. She'd taught elementary school for 20 years before switching to nursing. She knew how to make things stick. I got a B on the next test. She put it on the fridge. Month two, I came home early, found her crying in the kitchen over bills.

I stood in the doorway. What's wrong? Nothing. Just budgeting. I heard her on the phone with her landlord asking for an extension. Turned out fostering me meant she lost her spare bedroom income room I was sleeping in. She'd been renting it out for three years. That was $400 a month. She didn't have anymore. She never mentioned it to me. Month three, I overheard her talking to my case worker. How's it going, the woman asked. She's doing great, really great. And you honestly, Rachel paused. It's hard, but she's worth it. I pressed my ear against my bedroom door. The 90 days will be up soon. Have you thought about extending every single day? Rachel said, but I don't want her to feel trapped or obligated. She needs to know this was her choice, too. My stomach dropped. I thought she was keeping me, thought I'd finally found somewhere stable. The 90 days ended on a Tuesday. I packed my bag that morning before school, hands shaking, left it by my bedroom door. Rachel saw it when I got home. Her face fell. You're leaving. Isn't that the deal? Ninety days. She sat down at the kitchen table, looked smaller than I'd ever seen her. That was the deal, she said quietly. But I was hoping we could change it. She slid a new paper across the table. New contract, no end date, same rules. But you're family now, not Temporary, permanent. I look at the paper. My name was already filled in under daughter. The date at the top is from week two. You planned this? I hoped for it. The 90 days wasn't a trial period for you. And what was it she met my eyes was for me to prove I could do it right, that I wouldn't give up when things got hard, that I'd choose you every single day, even when it cost me. I looked at that paper, at my name and her handwriting the word daughter. What if I mess up, I asked. Then we'll fix it together. I signed the paper. She put it in a frame and hung it in the hallway. Three years later, I graduated high school. She was in the front row. Last year, I finished my first year of college. She still text me every morning, still sends notes. The schedule still on my childhood bedroom door.

I paused, looked around and said, I never got any money. The entire table went silent. You could hear the clinking of silverware from other tables, but at ours, dead quiet. My parents froze. My dad's fork literally clattered onto his plate and my mom's hands started shaking as she reached for her wine glass. What do you mean you never got any money? Grandma asked. Voice getting that sharp edge I remembered from when she caught my cousins lying as kids. My mom cleared her throat nervously. Mother, we can explain this later. No, grandma's voice cut through the air like a knife. Explain it now. I've been sending 3 thousand dollar checks to Monica every single month since Aubrey started college. Where is that money? My brain was spinning. Three thousand dollars a month for four years? I started doing the math in my head while everyone stared at me. That's when my little sister Savannah, who'd been scrolling through Instagram this whole time, suddenly looked up. Oh, wait, is that where mom got the money for my BMW? If the table was quiet before, now it was like a tomb. Savannah, shut up, my mom hissed. But it was too late. And my spring break trip to Cancun last month, Savannah continued, completely oblivious to the horror spreading across everyone's faces. And that designer Bag you bought me for Christmas. I felt like I was watching my life in slow motion. Four years, four brutal years of working three jobs just to afford ramen noodles and textbooks. 60 hour work weeks while my parents took family vacations, sleeping in a moldy basement apartment while my sister got a luxury car. You from me, I said. My voice barely a whisper. My dad finally found his voice. Aubrey, Sweetheart, it's not what it looks like, really. I stood up, my chair scraping against the floor because it looks like you watched me destroy my health working multiple jobs while you used my money to spoil Savannah. The restaurant felt like it was spinning. I.

The class erupted in whispers. Missus Wilson's voice got tight. The curriculum says. Actually, I interrupted, pulling up the state science standards on my phone, the current curriculum specifically mentions this myth as something to correct. I showed her the screen. That's when she asked me to step into the hallway. The kids watched wide eyed as the door closed behind us. Do you have any idea how hard it is to teach these kids when parents undermine my authority? She hissed. Now they'll question everything I say! I kept my voice calm. Isn't that exactly what we want them to do? Question things and learn critical thinking? I've been teaching for 22 years, she snapped. I'm not changing my whole curriculum because some nurse thinks he knows better than our textbooks. That night, Lily asked me if she was in trouble because Missus Wilson kept giving her mean looks all afternoon. I assured her she wasn't. The next day, Missus Wilson announced a pop quiz with questions like what colour is blood inside the body? Lily answered red and got marked wrong. She came home crying with a big red F. I requested a meeting with the principal and brought printouts of medical textbooks, state science standards, and Lily's quiz. Principal Davis listened carefully, then called in Missus Wilson. When confronted with the evidence, Missus Wilson insisted, this is how I've always taught it. Principal Davis asked But is it correct? After a long pause, Missus Wilson said, it's what the children understand better. I lost it. My daughter is crying every morning before school because she's afraid of getting F's for writing down the truth. Two weeks later, the school replaced their 1998 science books. Missus Wilson was required to attend professional development on current scientific standards. On Lily's next report card, Missus Wilson wrote, excellent critical thinking skills. But at the parent teacher conference, she wouldn't look me in the eye. And when I signed up to help with the science fair, I noticed my name had been crossed off the volunteer list. Lily still checks with me whenever she learns something new at school. Dad, is this actually true, or is it just a Missus Wilson truth?

When I came back to nothing but bare walls, they were waiting in the driveway laughing. Surprise! Now you're broke! My dad shouted while my sister took selfies with my empty house. I just smiled, which made my sister demand, what's so funny? I pulled out my phone, sent her a video and said surprise! She started screaming. The rental car was still ticking when I saw my father's truck blocking my driveway. My sister Madison's BMW sat on the lawn, tire tracks ruining the grass. The front door hung wide open. They came out recording on their phones, laughing. There he is! Dad shouted. Surprise! Now you're broke! Madison clicked toward me in designer heels. We helped you declutter. You always want to simplify. Right through the doorway I could see straight through to the back windows. No furniture, no nothing. Where is everything? Sold it, dad said proudly. Made about $140,000. Not bad for two weeks. I walked through while they followed, filming. Living room, TV mount empty. Cables dangling. Kitchen, no microwave, no coffee maker. My home office, where I built my business over five years. Completely gutted. Three monitors, the eight hundred dollar chair that saved my back. External hard drives with years of work, gone. My bedroom was empty. They taken my grandfather's dresser. Where are my clothes? Goodwill, Madison said. Your sneaker Collection went for more than expected. Those sneakers were stories. First client meeting, rare garage sale. Find gift from my best friend before he moved to Japan. All gone. We saved you from yourself. Dad said family helps family. Madison needed help. You weren't answering, so we made an executive decision. Something must have shown on my face. Maybe a smile. What's so funny? Madison demanded. Why are you smiling? I pulled out my phone and sent the video. Surprise, I said quietly. Her phone chimed. Dad looked over her shoulder.

I looked across the yard. Steven was laughing with his college buddies. Every single one of them was graying, thickening around the middle, showing normal signs of being in their 40s, Steven included. Why are you telling me this? I asked. Doctor Reid's expression softened because I just watched him criticize what you eat at your own cookout. I've watched him make three separate comments about your appearance in the past hour alone. And professionally, I can tell you this pattern doesn't get better without major intervention. It gets worse. He be in different therapy or he needs to recognize what he's doing first. And frankly, Lauren, you need to decide if you want to spend the next 30 years like his mother did. She walked away before I could respond. The rest of the cookout felt surreal. I started noticing everything. Steven only introduced me as my wife without mentioning my name. How he redirected conversations away from my job at the architecture firm. How he physically positioned himself between me and his male friends at night. After everyone left, Steven started his usual routine. Great party, babe. Although maybe tomorrow we could look into that gym membership again. I saw a group on. Your therapist told me about your father. I interrupted. The color drained from his face. What she had no right to, she had every right. She watched you publicly humiliate me for hours and told me I deserve better. That's a violation of doctor Patient confidentiality. I'm reporting her. She didn't violate anything, Steven. She observed you treating me like your father treated your mother. Then she gave me information that apparently you've been too ashamed to share yourself. We switch tactics immediately. Look, I didn't mean anything by those comments. I'm just worried about your health. Stop. Just stop. I felt surprisingly calm. I'm 42 years old. I've had two kids. I work 50 hours a week. And I'm done pretending your criticism is concern. You're overreacting. Your mother developed an eating disorder because of your father. Did you know that? Your therapist just told me. His mouth opened and closed. I'm filing for divorce. I, you can work through your father issues without projecting them onto me. I moved to my sister's house that night. His father called two days later screaming about how I was abandoning his son during a vulnerable time, how I was selfish, how I'd regret this. Like father, like son.

I didn't expect the shampoo I used to poison the fish in the water. So I tried to make a fire by rubbing two sticks together. But after an hour of trying, I still failed. Then I lit a cigarette and fell asleep on the ground. By nightfall, I finally ate some grilled fish. I had been trapped here for three days. It was the first thing I'd eaten in all that time. At night, a few pigeons ate the leftover fish, and they were poisoned, too. So that's how I got more food to eat. One day, while squatting on the ground in a daze, I accidentally found a pack of instant noodles. Inside there was still a small packet of seasoning. The picture of noodles on the package made me crave them even more. So I really wanted to eat noodles like that. First, I dug a hole in the ground. Then I searched for undigested seeds and bird droppings. After finding some, I started farming the land. I mixed the seeds with the droppings and planted them every day. I worked hard, and after six months, my crops finally grew corn. When the corn ripened, I began making noodles. I ground the corn into flour, then add water to knead the dough. After a long and complicated process, I finally made a bowl of handmade noodles. When the noodles were ready, I took out that precious packet. Of seasoning. After waiting nearly 200 days, I finally tasted those delicious noodles. At that moment, tears of joy rolled down my face. But that night, heavy rain fell. All my crops were destroyed. Even my makeshift shelter was washed away by the flood. The next morning, I stared hopelessly at the devastation. Just then, two sanitation workers appeared behind me. They came to take me off the island. I looked at them in despair, unable to say a single word.

Hizo todo esto solo para aumentar su estatus como jefe de una pandilla, sin darse cuenta de que acababa de provocar a un monstruo. Cuando el padre de la mujer, Jack, recibió la noticia, corrió a ver a su hija y a su nieta. Su hija había quedado ciega y su nieta había desaparecido. La devastadora verdad hizo que Jack estallara de furia. Lo que lo llevó al límite fue descubrir que la policía estaba trabajando con la pandilla e incluso habían detenido a las víctimas. Después de despedirse de su hija, Jack comenzó su cacería. Cualquier policía que intentara detenerlo caía al instante. Muy pronto localizó a un delincuente del barrio y lo obligó a decirle en qué bar se escondía el jefe de la banda, Jackie. Rompió en el lugar y acabó con todos, pero lo único que consiguió fue el número de teléfono del jefe. Cuando llamó, el jefe descubrió que hablaba con el padre de la mujer y aún así tuvo el Descaro de burlarse de él. Enfurecido, Jack pidió a un viejo compañero de guerra que lo ayudara a rastrear la llamada y luego fue solo. Directo a la sede del jefe.

But before she could finish drinking, I caught up with them. I was ready to take him to the police station when I suddenly saw the little girl curled up in the corner. That sight moved me deeply. Why didn't you tell me anything? Where are your parents? They left us. I felt sorry for them, so I gave them the food I just bought. Then I took them home and prepared clothes and meals for them.

I thought he was stealing again, and I got So angry that my heart gave out, I collapsed on the couch in pain. Yet the boy didn't run away. A while later, I opened my eyes and realized it was him who saved me. But I still accused him of being a thief to the doctor. Then I was completely shocked. Because what he'd been hiding was a photo of my daughter. Why do you want a photo of my daughter? She's our mother. His words sounded unbelievable. But to prove the truth, he handed me his mother's pocket watch. Inside was a picture that made me certain. After my daughter married far away, I only knew she had passed away. I never imagined I still had two grandchildren. At that moment, I felt it was a gift from heaven. So I held the children tightly in my arms.

La personne dans le vieux tableau derrière elle semblait avoir bougé. Elle se retourne à confuse, se rappelant que le visage de la femme était tourné vers la droite, mais maintenant, il était tourné vers la gauche. En y réfléchissant, elle pensa qu'il était peu probable que le tableau ait pu bouger tout seul, mais que cela devait être une illusion. Cependant, ce qui se passait ensuite fut encore plus bizarre. Dans la chambre de cathy se trouvait également un tableau ancien similaire d'une personne tenant une paire de ciseaux et un peigne. Le tableau était un peu une horreur, mais cathy essaya de l'enlever, sans succès, comme s'il ne s'agissait pas d'un tableau, mais d'une personne. La nuit, quand cathy s'endormit, le bruit de ciseaux se fit soudain entendre à côté d'elle, et, dans un clique-tige, les cheveux de cathy furent inexplicablement coupés. Le lendemain, cathy se réveilla et constata que la moitié de ses cheveux manquaient. Ses beaux cheveux longs avaient été coupés et abîmés. Cathy pensa que c'était sa sœur espiègle qui lui avait fait une farce. elle la tira du lit et était sur le point de la frapper, mais annie arriva juste à temps pour les arrêter. Cathy se plaignait à annie que sa sœur lui avait coupé les cheveux la nuit dernière, pendant son sommeil. Mais elle avait l'air innocente, car elle n'avait rien fait la nuit dernière. Annie savait comment était sa Fille cadette, mais peu importe combien elle essayait d'expliquer, annie ne l'a cru pas et exigea qu'elle s'excuse auprès de cathy, sans se rendre compte qu'elles avaient toutes les deux eu tort. La nuit suivante, cathy s'apprêtait à se brosser les cheveux et à se coucher, quand elle entendit soudain ce qui ressemblait à des ciseaux. Parce que ses cheveux avaient été coupés sans raison apparente et qu'elle était très sensible au bruit des ciseaux. Quand elle tourna la tête pour regarder derrière elle, elle vit le tableau des ciseaux et du peigne sur la table de chevet. Et maintenant, ce tableau la mettait très mal à l'aise. Alors, elle trouva un morceau de tissu blanc pour cacher le tableau. Au moment où elle s'endormait, le bruit de ciseaux qui clique se fit à nouveau entendre à côté de cathy, et une main s'étira de derrière le tissu blanc, coupant lentement les cheveux de cathy. Quand cathy se réveilla, la main retourna dans le tissu blanc et disparu. Quand cathy se réveilla, elle toucha ses cheveux coupés et pensa instantanément à sa sœur espièque. Cependant, au moment où elle allait sortir pour donner une leçon à sa sœur, elle trouva que c'était un peu déraisonnable que sa sœur n'aurait pas pu venir dans sa chambre la nuit, quand il faisait si sombre dehors. Où y avait-il quelqu'un d'autre ? dans sa chambre ? alors qu'elle se posait la question, le tissu blanc qu'elle avait utilisé pour cacher le tableau changea soudainement et On aurait dit que quelqu'un en sortait. En entendant les cris. Sa famille entra dans la chambre, et cathy s'écria et pointa du doigt le tableau au-dessus de son lit, désignant la personne dont elle parlait, qui était juste derrière elle. Comment la famille pouvait-elle croire ça ? ils pensèrent tous que cathy faisait un cauchemar. Cependant, cathy était tellement sûr d'avoir raison qu'elle montra à tout le monde que ses cheveux avaient été coupés beaucoup plus courts. En voyant cela, la famille, un peu sceptique, devient sérieuse aussi, afin que cathy n'ait plus peur. Adam voulu t'enlever le tableau, mais peu importe combien. Il essaya, le tableau ne bougea pas, comme s'il avait poussé sur le mur. Finalement, il fallut toute la force des deux hommes, adam et nick, pour retirer le tableau du mur. Il pensait que ce serait la fin de l'histoire, mais alors des choses encore plus étranges se produisirent anne dormait la nuit quand elle entendit quelqu'un courir dans la maison. elle pensa que c'était sa fille cadette qui ne dormait pas, mais quand elle sortit de sa chambre pour vérifier, elle vit un enfant sauté dans le tableau, et ce n'était pas sa fille, lucie, mais la personne du tableau originale ff.

Are you shitting me? Look around this place. You see all these waitresses working their asses off for a third of what she makes? No, she had a choice and she chose a shortcut.

And by the way, you have to have a main piece before you can have a side piece. And I ain't got either one. This is Rebecca Falcon. She's an attorney representing the company.

We wanted a drink. She's on spring break and she should be drinking. Come on. This is Alita's Mother of the year, in case you're wondering. Thank you. Well, y'all enjoy it, cause we're about to head out together. As a matter of coincidence, we will be leaving the cafe at the same time and we're gonna get in different cars and go to our respective homes. Not that I owe you a fucking explanation. You don't wanna stay for supper? No. Yeah, Tommy, stay for supper. Your lawyer and her lips are welcome to join us. I'm sure she'd rather go home and push her cuticles back on. If I can screwdriver, I'd love to join. Wow. Suit yourself. Now you know this has the potential to become a real scene. You understand that? Uh huh.

Pay attention or someone might get hurt. We adopted Jimmy. It turns out I'm not fit to. This is not on you. This is on whoever took Jimmy. We're gonna find both of them. Did you give birth to a son? At New York Presbyterian. June 21st, 2,012 received a threatening text and the next morning Jimmy was kidnapped. I didn't think that he would do anything. Who wouldn't do anything? I think my ex, Tommy. He was just released from prison. He didn't know that I'd given him up. Tommy Reinhardt. Yeah. We heard about what happened with your son, Jimmy. What Kelly did was horrible, giving away our child without even telling me. What did you do? Cried. But I've accepted that he's gone. Hopefully now he'll live a better life than I could ever give him. Where were you Tuesday morning between 8 and 9:00am? I would have been down the block at Saint Mary's, the soup kitchen. Why? You guys wanna know where I was? Cause Jimmy's gone missing. You know that? I do now. Somebody dropped that off at my house today. Somebody took them to Alby's Ice Cream. Look at the back. Hey, Dominique, who are they? They're friends. Everything's fine already. He's okay. Please don't do this in front of my Son, I don't want this to be the last memory he has of me. So why don't you just ask someone if you could see him when he's calm. So you kidnapped him. At least now he knows who I am. If you want to say goodbye, now is your chance. I really missed you, pal, but I gotta go away again. Be good for your mom, okay? Thank you.

Were you successful? Somewhat. Your name is Jamal al Bazza. Your son Amir was killed in 2,003 in a bombing at the Mofus bazaar in Cairo. Since then you've been recruiting m I. S.

Why is it always those who profess to be the most fervent believers in this war, they always manipulate other people to die for them? Does your president go into battle or does he send your children tonight, all those innocent people, there is no such thing, Gideon. They were infidels and they were engaged in activities that spread American policies over the entire world. Your insatiate need to own things, material things, your capitalism rests on the back of third world countries. No one's hands are clean. No one is innocent. Those people tonight, they were innocent.

Hey, get out of here. You're gonna get a shot. I'm serious. I'm so afraid about you finding out the truth, but now it's out and it's okay. It's kind of a rush.

You ain't see nothing yet. I said stop it, babe. Can a girl be totally overcome with desire for someone to be so cool and so forgiving? It is. We are not okay, this is not fine. Good. Now we can talk about it. Is that what this is about? Yeah, that's what this is about. You find out that I personally got you thrown in here at the exact moment your manicured fingers are like closing on the yuppie brass ring and somehow you don't have a problem with it. You are so full of shit. Fuck you. Fuck you, Alex. You want me to be angry? Well guess what? I'm really fucking angry because I love you Alex. I love you and I fucking hate you. I have really been trying to keep my shit together, but if you really need to see me Hulk out over this, Larry left you, didn't he? And that's why you're fake fine with me right now. You're willing to overlook pretty much anything because ultimately you are just terrified Of being alone. Is that what I am to you? A fucking, a fucking binky for you to suck on until you feel better? Look at me. Why did you do it? They were offering less time, a lot less time, depending on how much I gave them. I hadn't seen or heard from you in 8 years. You weren't even real anymore, which made it easier. And I was pretty sure one of the other guys would give you up anyway. And if I'm being really honest, I was still pissed at you for leaving for my mom. So yeah, at that moment I probably was just like, fuck you. You know, I'm not proud of myself. You lied to me when I first got here. You could have given me this whole speech right then. I wanted you to like me. I still do. Maybe you should have thought that all the way through.

I brought one for myself, too. How about we all do some medicine? He really needs our help. He needs our help? He sounds like he's got a blow dryer in his chest. Exactly. Which is why he needs our help. This is the problem with cardiologists. You're really good at telling people when something's broken, not so good at knowing when they can't be fixed. If that kid is dying, I'm not gonna tell his mother that unless I'm damn sure. You heard that heart. I heard that heart, and it sounded like crap. But until we do a trans esophageal echo, I don't know anything. We will transist off a gecko. My neighbor Leah. If she were ever in a fire, she'd be rescued first. Why is that? Dr. Melendez says attractive people have advantages. Dr. Melendez says that, does he? Why is that funny? I don't know. It's just, um. Some people consider Dr. Melendez attractive. So how's it going with Clea? She doesn't like me. Why do you say that? She said I was an ass hat. Yeah? What was she doing when she said that? Touching me. She was flirting with you. Sometimes people say the opposite of what they Mean, um, they use teasing as a way of saying something they don't mean instead of saying something that they do. I haven't seen any data on the use of antonyms as a flirting technique. Okay, well, um, here's what to look for. You ready? Yes. Okay. The pretentious giggle, the, uh, the squirm, and the hair sweep. I call it the flirting trifecta. Hair scuffing is used in both animals and humans, Claire. Secreting glands are located in the scalp and fur. Scuffing sends hormones out into the environment to let a potential mate know they're interested. Or it could be ringworm. Yeah, I suppose. You have to pack up that hospitalily. He's even worse than we thought. Yeah. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, atrial septal defect, abnormal insertion of the mitral leaflet. Never seen so many anomalies in your heart. I'm sorry. I pushed for additional testing and only got his mother's hopes up. Any medication that'll help? Beta blockers, maybe in the toprol. It's not like I'll get to play soccer, but they might help him get to the field to watch for a couple years, maybe. Better than dying on the table tomorrow. You, Tilloki. Don't break it to the mom. It's called Safar. Given by Aushman with his heartbeat. It follows the sound, reminds it to beat until you fix it. Missus bhangra. I've completed all the tests. And I'm sorry that you've come all this way. Gabriel was in my belly. Evil spirits came to him. Invade his heart. A village shaman tried to rid him. He could not. Then a vision came to him. A stronger healer would come. You. You. You save Gabriel. I don't know about evil spirits. All I know is that your son was born with a heart that I can't fix. I'm sorry. Would not have come so far if I did not believe you. We'll give him medicine to make him feel better, and then you can take him home.

Yeah, about 5 months ago. He hit his head. So what brings you in today? I was changing Xavier's clothes this morning and I noticed a sore on his hip. Maybe I left him on his side too long. Just worried it's infected. Let's roll him. Okay. So it should never get to this point. We try to turn him regularly. Well, there's actually an air mattress that can help with that. We'll send you home today with some antibiotics, but why don't you come with me and we can go over a handout about how to prevent bed sores, keep this from happening again. I'm Dr Charles with psychiatry. I have been reviewing Xavier's medical records, and I think that there's a very good chance that he was misdiagnosed there. Misdiagnosed? Yeah. I don't think your son is in a vegetative state. Do you know how his joints, they stay in the same position after they've been moved? That's something called waxy flexibility. It is indicative of only one condition, catatonia. I think that I can help your son, but in order for me to do that, he needs to stay here. Wait, we're staying. Catatonia only freezes the voluntary muscle groups, not the involuntary ones like those that help us breathe. So if I'm right and Xavier is indeed catatonic, he does not need the ventilator to breathe and. We can disconnect. Wait. But isn't that dangerous? The doctor said he'd die without it and they said he wasn't. What's the expression? Protecting his airway. He has a tank, which means that we can always reconnect the band if he needs it. Do we, do we have your permission? Yes. Okay, Miss Carrie. Okay. Sats are dropping. 92, 90 isn't that bad? Not necessarily. It's carbon dioxide build up. It should kick his respiratory system into drive. 85. Dr Charles, he's not breathing. Wait, wait, wait.

You planned a champagne toast to cover up your jealousy. You're a genius. You should call the Harper Avery people. Tell them maybe they'll give me an award. Hmm.

No fue hasta que el control terrestre notó que la aeronave se había desviado de su ruta. Se dieron cuenta de que algo no estaba bien a bordo. Sin embargo, un veterano entre los pasajeros descubrió accidentalmente que las armas de los secuestradores estaban cargadas con balas de fogueo. Esto porque cuando los pasajeros luchaban con los secuestradores antes, un disparo se disparó por accidente, pero ninguno de los pasajeros resultó herido. Ni siquiera quedaron agujeros de bala, y la presión de la cabina tampoco había cambiado. Esto sugería que las armas probablemente estaban cargadas con balas de fogueo que solo hacen ruido pero no causan daño real. Lograban unir a todos para resistir. Podían usar su ventaja numérica para dominar a los 5 secuestradores, pero esta teoría fue rechazada por Sam. Para estar seguro, sugirió que la gente en la cabina buscara la bala que había sido disparada. Los pasajeros en esa área no la encontraban solo, entonces podrían estar seguros de que eran balas de fogueo. Con eso, el hombre gordo presionó el botón para llamar a un secuestrador. Llamó a la secuestradora, fingiendo estar mareado y queriendo ir al baño para vomitar, pero la secuestradora fue extremadamente cautelosa. No le permitieron tirar de la cadena y tuvo que dejarle ver el vómito en el inodoro. Después de entrar al baño, él inmediatamente escribió, Un mensaje en papel con un bolígrafo. Cuando la secuestradora no lo estaba mirando. Luego arrojó el papel enrollado hacia la cabina es esperando que los pasajeros en clase económica ayudaran a buscar la bala. Una mujer curiosa abrió el papel y al leer el mensaje se agachó al suelo y comenzó a buscar. Justo cuando revisaba la última fila, fue de repente vista por un secuestrador. La mujer estaba muy nerviosa y mintió diciendo que estaba buscando sus gafas. El secuestrador encontró las gafas en el suelo y se las devolvió después de regresar a su asiento. Inmediatamente encendió la luz de lectura sobre su cabeza, señalando al hombre. Esto llenó al hombre de confianza sobre cómo terminar con este desastre, pero Sam le dijo que tal vez no se había encontrado la bala y que sin pruebas suficientes, actuar apresuradamente podría hacer que los pasajeros inocentes murieran. En ese momento, una azafata escuchó su conversación y secretamente se acercó a Sam diciéndole que no hace mucho una niña había encontrado una bala en el baño. Podían averiguar cómo era la bala que la niña vio. Podrían determinar si las armas de los secuestradores tenían balas de fogueo, así que el veterano dibujó dos balas en papel. Viendo darle la nota a la niña para que las identificara y confirmara, pero había secuestradores patrullando por todas partes. No permitían que los pasajeros se movieran o hablasen. La azafata de repente pensó en una forma. Pidió a los secuestradores que Sirvieran comida a los pasajeros y explicó que en esas circunstancias, si los pasajeros se quedaban hambrientos durante mucho tiempo podría estallar un motín. Finalmente, los secuestradores aceptaron darles a todos una botella de agua y durante la distribución del agua, los dibujos de las dos balas fueron entregados con éxito a la niña. La niña abrió los dibujos y pensó por un momento, finalmente confirmando que las armas de los secuestradores efectivamente estaban cargadas con balas de fogueo. Justo cuando se preparaban para actuar. El primer objetivo era uno de los secuestradores más viejos. De repente, un pasajero expresó su descontento con los secuestradores por no ofrecer comida y de hecho comenzó a pelear físicamente con uno de ellos. Dado que los secuestradores tenían armas, nadie se atrevió a ayudar solo. Sam pensó que esta era la oportunidad perfecta, pero el hombre ahora estaba demasiado asustado para moverse, así que ahora Sam era el único que podía ser el héroe. Sam ya se había colado en la clase económica. Se deslizó entre las dos personas que peleaban y llegó a la posición más vulnerable, enfocándose en otro secuestrador más viejo. Sam aprovechó la oportunidad para emboscarlo, pero fue derribado al suelo por el hombre mayor, quien reaccionó rápidamente. Afortunadamente, con la ayuda de un pasajero lograron derribarlo. El hombre mayor recogió el arma del suelo. El pasajero estaba demasiado asustado y rápidamente corrió, pero Sam estaba muy confiado. Declaró directamente que las armas de los secuestradores tenían balas de Fogueo, el hombre mayor, se mostró muy confundido por lo que dijo. Sin embargo, lo que Sam no esperaba era que el secuestrador líder ya había sacado balas reales. Las cargó todas en el cargador y se dirigía directamente a la sección económica donde estaba el motín. De repente, un disparo resonó en la cabina. Una mujer fue alcanzada y cayó al suelo. La cabina quedó instantáneamente en silencio. Finalmente, Sam se dio cuenta de que había apostado mal

Los hombres aceleraron la moto y se marcharon. Al principio john no le dio importancia, pero más tarde, mientras hacía compras con kelly, volvió a ver la misma motocicleta. Su instinto se activó de inmediato. Algo no iba bien. John pisó el acelerador y fue tras ellos sin pensarlo. Gracias a sus habilidades al volante consiguió perderlos en un semáforo en rojo. Ya de vuelta en la casa, john enfrentó a kel exigiendo explicaciones. Ella finalmente confesó la verdad. Su padre intentaba obligarla a casarse con un empresario violento para cerrar un trato. Su madre la había ayudado a escapar para evitarle ese destino. Mientras hablaban, un grupo de hombres armados entró en la propiedad. John le dijo a kelly que se escondiera y se preparó para enfrentarlo solo se acercó sigilosamente a uno de ellos y lo eliminó sin hacer ruido.

Se movió rápido, sorprendió al secuestrador y lo neutralizó de inmediato. Luego tomó a kelly y a su madre y huyeron en coche. Los hombres lo siguieron sin dudar, pero en un cruce, john apareció de la nada y embistió su vehículo de costado. Aunque lograron escapar por un tiempo, john no bajó la guardia. Gracias a su entrenamiento, tiró todos los teléfonos, abandonó el coche en la carretera y subió a un autobús público con 2h mujeres. Por fin parecía que los habían perdido, pero poco después john vio algo en las noticias que heló la sangre. Lo estaban señalando como el asesino de los guardias de la finca. Buscando respuestas, contactó a su amigo kevin y juntos regresaron a la casa. Extrañamente, el lugar que antes estaba cubierto de sangre ahora estaba impecable. Revisaron las grabaciones de seguridad y lo que john vio lo dejó sin habla. El video mostraba que era él quien mataba a los guardias. Por primera vez, john empezó a dudar de sí mismo. Podía haberlo hecho de verdad porque no recordaba nada. Justo cuando la desesperación lo dominaba, kevin notó que algo en toda aquella escena no cuadraba

No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Epie. She's not circulating. It won't get to her heart. It'll pull in her system and that could be toxic. We need dual chest tubes and a thoracic lavage. Get on it. I got it. Schmidt, get up here. She needs better circulation. We need to oppose abdominal CPR. Helm. You get in here, you push, you alternate. You circulate the whole body. Push Push, keep it steady. About 100 beats per minute. She has seatbelt bruises. She wasn't thrown from the car. I'm guessing she got out and made the 9 1 1 call and she fell into the ravine. It was icy. She must have been disoriented. She's trying to save Taylor. How long have we been doing these compressions? An hour. We have to tell Jackson. I mean, he has a patient on the table. This is the mother of his child. I know, Maggie. But right now, we don't need people with big feelings. We need people who can help. What's your temperature now? 76. This isn't going fast enough. I wanna get her to an O r. And put her on bypass. Let's prep her to move. Go find some people who can help. Okay, got it. Alex. Hey, I gotta taste some cake with Kevin. You wanna come? What is it? It's Kevin. You gotta come with me. What that, that is that is that V tube? Is that a rhythm? I don't see. I know you don't see that. There. Right there. Right there. You don't see that. Charge. Charge to 1:20. No, I don't see a rhythm. Clear. Clear now. Alright. Charge to 150. Clear, Maggie. I got it. I see it. I see it. Charge to 200. Maggie, clear. Stop. Enough. Alright, stop. Please.

Cada vez que su novio toca su cabeza, rosas frescas brotan de su melena. Esa fragancia mágica enamora a quien la huele. Pero en los ojos de su novio no hay amor, solo oportunidades de negocio. De inmediato, comienza a arrancar las rosas de su cabeza y las vende a la floristería local a cambio de montones de billetes. La convierte en un campo de flores viviente, cosechando sin parar de su cabeza, ignorando por completo el sufrimiento que ella soporta. Para él no es más que un árbol de dinero que sostiene su vida de lujos. La chica, al límite de su paciencia, hierve de rabia y despierta su poder. Su cabello ya no produce rosas, sino cactus afilados y punzantes. El novio codicioso se llena de terror. Su árbol de dinero se fuma en un instante. Mientras retrocede. Presa del pánico, recibe su merecido. Cae de espaldas en un enorme matorral de cactus. En ese momento, otra mujer entra por la puerta, cargando a su novio holgazán e inútil, llevándolo como si fuera un saco de patatas. El cabello de la chica rubia se ha transformado en radiantes girasoles, símbolo de su poder recuperado. La recién llegada huele los girasoles y de pronto siente brotar su conciencia de independencia. Tira al niñato al suelo y se marcha sin mirar atrás. Inspirada por esto, la chica original finalmente comprende que tampoco necesita a ese novio codicioso. Da media Vuelta y se va, dejándolo solo en pleno colapso. Desesperado por volver a hacerse rico, el hombre intenta replicar la magia y se echa agua en su calva cabeza. Sorprendentemente funciona, un poco de yerba y una pequeña flor brotan de su cuero cabelludo, pero antes de poder impresionar a alguna nueva ricachona, entra una cebra de golpe y se come directamente todo lo que le acaba de crecer, dejándolo sin absolutamente nada.

The infected can only beg tearfully for mercy, as if something far worse than death waits inside. But for the safety of the majority, the crowd forces them in with cold resolve. As the heavy stone door slowly closes. No one survives the night. By the time the gates open again the next day, the swiftest runners rush in, while beyond the high walls, an endless labyrinth stretches out. These runners are the camp's last hope. Only through the maps they chart of the maze can the others find the way out. But today felt different. Normally, the runners emerged before sunset, but today their figures remained absent. Some began to speculate. Maybe they had been killed by the labyrinth's monsters. Each gust of wind through the passage signalled the stone gate's imminent closure. Just as despair started to settle in, Mike suddenly pointed toward the labyrinth's stats. There, a runner, minus, staggered toward the exit, carrying the wounded captain on his back. Minus was utterly exhausted, and the gate was closing fast. Mike scrambled through the narrow gap. Though he squeezed in, minus couldn't understand this reckless act. Realizing Mike was new to the camp, minus explained the danger. The captain had been attacked by lurking monsters and was showing signs of infection. Night was falling, and the beasts would soon emerge in full force. Nino wanted to find cover first, but Mike insisted on hiding the captain

Ana esperó 50 años para que esa promesa se cumpliera, pero con el tiempo, John se volvió tacaño y calculador. Cada vez que ella gastaba dinero, él le reprochaba hasta el último céntimo. Ana pensaba que su marido ahorraba para esos viajes y nunca se atrevió a interferir. John daba por sentada su tolerancia.

It turns out they shared the ability to feel sensations, so the pain was mutual. 20 years ago, when Marco was in elementary school, he suddenly felt his heart race, his body trembling and nervous. The others were confused, but Marco saw a ski slope and a girl out of control with a loud crash. Marco passed out in the classroom and the girl in the snow, their first sensory link went unnoticed. Over the years, Marco went from being a teenager to a mature man. While driving, he saw another scene through his eyes. At the same time, Kelly, thousands of miles away, also noticed her blurry vision. Fuck what. Marco stopped the car immediately. After all these years, that strange voice in his mind was so clear, was sure it wasn't a hallucination. Shut up. When they both calmed down, they realized they shared the vision. The strangest part was that even though they were 1,000 miles apart and in different time zones, they could hear each other and share each other's vision. Thus, two people with no connection became linked. To avoid disrupting their work, they agreed to talk at night. As a child, Marco had good grades, but as an adult, he took the blame for a friend and spent five years in prison. Now he lived in misery in an abandoned shack, surviving on government subsidies. The police often visited him, warning him. That if he committed another crime, he would lose his humble job washing cars. Kelly's life, on the other hand, was the complete opposite. After graduation, she quickly married a rich man to escape her parents control. She lived a luxurious life, but had to accompany her husband to events and endure luxurious stairs that her husband ignored, using Kelly's beauty for business. Her seemingly happy marriage was full of interests. That night, Marco and Kelly connected again. Years of doubt finally had an answer. A few days earlier at a party, Kelly felt a sharp pain in her shoulder for no reason. In reality, Marco at a bar had been hit by a crazy man with a stick. The sudden connection caused that the incident was similar to 20 years ago. The piercing pain, Marco still hadn't forgotten it. Kelly remembered her skiing accident. Though their lives were difficult with this ability, they became close friends. At 15, Kelly broke up with her first love and spent the summer in sadness, which also affected Marco. Kelly knew Marco had gone to prison for his friend. Living through five terrible years, they had always been there for each other. This constant sense of companionship warmed their hearts. Suddenly, Marco had an audacious idea. He wanted to meet Kelly in person, but the distance almost made it impossible. Then he thought of using their sensory ability. In front of a mirror, they could see each other. God, I'm beautiful. Such a Nice face. The next day, Kelly took her car for repairs. The mechanic asked for $1,000, but Marco suspected something was off and told her to check it. It was just a loose connector. So Marco saved Kelly the money. With Kelly's company, Marco regained hope. He started tidying up his messy room, working with dedication and fixing his neglected yard.

Just as he was about to strike, a gunshot rang out. He collapsed. The police had finally tracked him down. Even though the butcher died that night, my mind never recovered. 10 years passed, yet his shadow still haunted every corner of my brain. To finally conquer my inner demons, I didn't confront my fear. I became it. I dug up the butcher's old miners outfit in pickaxe and I began my own killing spree. First, I wanted revenge on my ex, the woman who abandoned me and her current husband, David. So I recreated a series of murders, making everyone believe the butcher from 10 years ago had returned. That way no suspicion would ever fall on me while I carried out my plan. One night, my ex and her best friend broke into a supermarket. I followed them inside to survive. They had no choice but to split up right then. My ex tripped and fell, a perfect chance. But her friend grabbed her and saved her. The two of them ran into a warehouse. I shoved a cabinet against the door to trap them, but breaking in was only a matter of time for me. They tried escaping through the window, but I was already waiting outside. I killed her friend first. My ex was so terrified, she bolted straight for the door and crashed into Her husband, David. I didn't get to kill her this time, but I moved on to the next phase of my plan. I called her and told her the butcher from 10 years ago was dead and the person killing now might be her husband in disguise. I said the proof was hidden in the old mine. Then I tricked her into getting in my car, planning to take her to the mine and finish her off with my pickaxe. But after investigating, her husband immediately called her and told her I was probably the real butcher and that I had serious mental issues. But even if she knew, it didn't matter. She was going to die by my pickaxe anyway. Just when I was getting excited, she grabbed the steering wheel and yanked it hard. The car crashed. I was knocked out cold. She crawled out and called her husband right away. David told her to go to the cabin in the woods. But as soon as she stepped inside, I was already there dressed as the butcher. She didn't suspect a thing. Only her husband knew about the cabin, so she assumed the butcher she was looking at was her husband.

The front door was wide open and several masked intruders were about to burst in. Luckily, I slammed the door shut at the last moment. Then I quickly activated the home security system. Still worried, I grabbed my phone to call the police. But my house is out in the countryside and it was pouring rain outside. Police said it would take at least 30 minutes to get here. I couldn't wait that long and immediately called my security company. I never expected the person answering to be a rookie on her first day. When she heard what was happening, she panicked. Fortunately, she quickly reached out to her supervisor, Jim. He stayed calm and patiently guided me. I woke my sleeping son and prepared to flee. Jim hacked into my home security feed and spotted two men and one woman among the intruders. He told my son and me to hide, but warned us to stay away from the front door. The intruders were setting explosives. Soon, the door blew open and the intruders entered. Guided by Jim, my son and I crept away step by step, trying not to be seen. The intruders then sprayed black paint on the security cameras. After covering all the cameras, they removed their masks and stopped hiding. Then they pulled out various detection devices. Just then, Jim remembered an emergency backup camera and activated it. The intruder split up. The woman hunted for my son. And me, while the two men searched for valuables. Meanwhile, I had my son hide in the storage room's ventilation opening, while I hid in the closet. But the intruder soon found us. Detecting something with his scanner, he grabbed an axe and swung it at the wall. Soon, he smashed a large hole, but only steel support rods were inside, so he walked away in frustration. My son and I were now safe, but the wall structure seemed to give the intruder an idea. Eventually, he found a hidden door, behind which was a safe. Meanwhile, I reconnected with Jim. He told us to go to the garage and drive away. Guided by Jim, we quickly reached the garage. But unfortunately, female intruder also appeared. At that moment, I signaled my son to stay silent. Unexpectedly, the female intruder suddenly threw a flash bang grenade. The piercing explosion instantly blinded us all. Still, we dared not make a sound. Yet even then, the female intruder continued walking toward us.

We trained with swords together, played together and built a deep bond as brothers. But early that morning, our father summoned us. When we saw the armor that symbolized ultimate power, it was clear he planned to choose one of us as his successor. Then father handed each of us a katana. Only the one who survived could inherit his position. Out of brotherly love, I sheath my blade and gave up the claim myself. But father, disappointingly, put the armor away. Hanzo stood there, torn within her conflict. I. I never imagined my brother would actually turn on me for power. Heartbroken and disillusioned, I left home without looking back. 20 years later, father died and the funeral bells echoed through Tokyo. Living and hiding under a false identity, I finally retrieved the weapons I had prepared for years. Late that night, a fierce monster stood on the palace rooftop. It was a predator that traveled across planets and aris, hunting only the strongest warriors. Soon, its target appeared. I floated downstream on a piece of driftwood until I reached the shore, then climbed the wall using my canoe. But I never knew the invisible predator was watching my every move. Soon, I located Hanzo's position, but a samurai in the watch tower spotted me just as he was about to ring the alarm. I threw my chain and wrapped it around the bell. Suddenly, the harsh ringing echoed anyway. My presence had been exposed. Hanzo instantly became alert. The next second, several red smoke bombs exploded around me. I moved swiftly through the mist, cutting down samurai one after another. Soon only the two of us brothers remained on the battlefield. I dropped all pretenses I would make him pay in blood for what happened years ago. We clashed immediately, but Hanzo, who had lived comfortably for so long, couldn't handle a real life or death fight. Predator hid in the ceiling silently waiting for the strongest to emerge. Our battle was evenly matched. We fought from the ground to the rooftops. Hanzos katana got stuck in the wooden beam. I seized the opening and kicked him back. Hanzo desperately dodged while trying to put on our father's armor. But even then, he was still no match for me. After a fierce barrage, I cornered him. A wave of regret washed over me. I only wanted to settle the old grudge, not kill him. But a deep roar suddenly echoed behind me. I threw a smoke bomb as samurai rushed into the room and the next second they were slaughtered by the predator. Realizing I stood no chance, I tried to slip away quietly, but the predator activated its cloaking device and locked onto me using heat signatures. A grappling hook shot toward my chest and I rolled aside just in time. He launched into a brutal parkour chase across the rooftops. But as the universe's Ultimate Warrior, the Predator caught up easily. In the critical moment, I tumbled back to the shore, only to discover Hanzo wasn't dead after all. But now wasn't the time to settle our grudge. The predator suddenly appeared behind me. Hanzo blocked the attack without hesitation, but was impaled straight through. I pushed my brother aside and used my agility to get behind the predator, but my blade couldn't even pierce its armor. Enraged, the predator pinned me down. At the last second, Hanzo attacked from behind. But the small wound didn't kill the predator, it only made it furious. I gathered my last strength as we brothers struggle to stand. But the predator had already vanished, leaving only a bloodstain on the tree. It was clear it had gone back into stealth mode. We braced ourselves, watching as leaves drifted to the ground. After surviving this life and death battle, we finally buried our hatred. But Hanzo, too badly wounded, collapsed anyway. And just then, a collar suddenly snapped around my neck.

Al mirar más de cerca, vi que era una moneda de quinientos yuanes de dos mil seis, bastante rara, así que la guardé en el bolsillo esa noche, con la intención de llegar a casa temprano. Tomé un callejón oscuro que normalmente no pasaba, pero recordé que no había peaje. Justo cuando pensaba en eso, el coche se detuvo frente a una caseta de peaje. Para mi sorpresa, el cartel decía que costaba quinientos yuanes pasar. Murmuré enojado y comencé a insertar monedas. Metí cinco monedas de cien yuanes, pero la barrera no se movió. Enfurecido, grité pidiendo al encargado, pero no había nadie. El lugar estaba vacío. Saqué la moneda de quinientos yuanes que me dio el hombre en el metro y la tiré en la máquina.

Instead of putting the phone away, she started threatening people on board, yelling that she'd slap everyone and daring anyone to speak to her. And then it escalated into the part nobody can believe. He pulled out pepper spray and blasted an entire family sitting feet away, parents and their small child included. The aftermath was caught on video. You can see the dad rubbing his eyes, his pants soaked from the spray. Workers rushed over with water, trying to flush out the kid's eyes, while the woman kept ranting like she was the victim. Passengers said all of this happened over nothing more than a request to stop blasting videos on speaker. And the wildest part? After the footage went viral, she doubled down. She posted on her story, bragging that she'd slap everybody on that boat and made it clear she wasn't sorry for any of it. No accountability, just more threats. Not just because of the behavior, but because a child was involved. All over a phone, all over basic public courtesy. And somehow she thinks she's the one being wronged.

He often hosted events to bring warmth to elderly people living alone. For several days in a row, he put on shows and held big communal meals. The elders felt guilty and insisted on buying something to support him. He told them only to buy what they truly needed. With his enthusiasm and sincerity, he quickly became loved by the elderly. But none of them knew that everything he showed was just an act. From their conversations, he Learned that my son was unemployed and my grandson was sick and often hospitalized. So he came to my stall to help me. He praised my looks, used sweet words to coax me, and even took photos with me. Later, he held a raffle. I won the grand prize, but to take it home, I had to pay 22% in tax. Hearing I had to pay money, I refused the prize. The man said he would pay the tax for me, Didn't want to owe him anything and insisted on leaving it behind. After that, I stopped attending his events. One day he came to find me. He performed at my seafood stall and helped me sell a lot. Grateful, I invited him to my home. He told me about his five year old son. Six since birth and hospitalized year round. He said he had to work hard to save for his son's surgery.

The color changes when it's exposed to light. The rainbow represents a spectrum of colors. Samantha, who came up with the name Rainbow Polish? I did. I was a student at Santa Monica Tech when Mister Trilling spoke to our class about using science to improve an everyday product. What was the name of the auditorium where he spoke? Spoke at Rainbow Hall. I named the product Rainbow because it was inspired by that talk. There were four versions of the polish. What were they called? Creativity, tenacity, inspiration, and passion. And why those names? Because those are Mister Trilling's four pillars of success. Why did you take the hard drive from the lab? Because the formula was mine. I gave Miss Simpson my complete business plan, and she claimed it as her own. Even if she were, the defendant is accused of wiping a corporate server and stealing a hard drive that did not belong to her. We asked that her testimony be stricken from the record. Is irrelevant. The jury will disregard if your client was wrong. There were other ways for her to handle her grievances. Nick, we're back in business. Full speed ahead. On two conditions. I want you to inform the ADA that nothing was stolen from your company. And then I want you to hire Miss Colby to supervise production of rainbow polish. She's a tech. If this nail Polish is your creation. How did you select the names of the four different color combinations? I've heard your speech, and like she said, it was a tribute to you and the four pillars of success. What's the fifth pillar? Excuse me? If you've heard that speech, you'd know there's another pillar. This is ridiculous. Sam, what's the fifth pillar? Honesty. And you're fired. Sam, welcome back. Thank you. How are you holding up? We won our case, and Sam and Bobby are on good terms.

These kids live below the poverty line. When they come to me for food, it breaks my heart to say no. But if I feed them, I'm in violation of school policy. So what can I do? I need you to represent these students. There's a school board meeting at 11. The superintendent's cutback in the hot lunch program is invalid as he failed to comply with the Sunshine Law. I only adjusted a preexisting formula. Thus the Sunshine Law does not apply. Has the board considered the huge impact this change? If our children aren't properly nourished, how are they supposed to concentrate in class? And shouldn't that be your No. 1 concern? Miss Bangham, your passion is impressive. Thank you. I'm sorry. But the board stands behind the superintendent. I'm so sorry. Is there anything else you can do? I'm gonna go back to the office, do a little research. Thank you. I saw your lunch lady client in the office this morning. She looked pretty good for a dead woman. What? We ran her Social Security number from the pro Bono retainer form, tracked it back to a woman who died 11 years ago. She probably just wrote down the wrong address on file. The DMV doesn't match the one she gave us. She's trying to make sure poor kids are getting Fed? Why would she lie? Our Social Security number tracks back to a woman named Trudy Sumner. Trudy went to the same high school as a woman named Ella Lawson. Now check this out. Oh, my god. Our lunch lady is a fugitive.

Since I couldn't afford to buy a chain, I avoided Malvo to buy some time. Hey, today is two days after the day before yesterday. So the question is, where's my chain? And I don't know where to get one. They generally found around next. Oh, you know, my friend Greg is this guy who wants him to snatch a chain for him. That's stealing, gonna get beat up anyway. So he can get beat up for breaking the law or beat up for not breaking the law. But at least if he doesn't break the law, the other guy go to jail and he'll get beat up instead. Should he snatch the chain or not snatch the chain? Not snatch the chain. Got my chain? No! Let him go. Who you supposed to be? Dad? So I'm supposed to be afraid cause you brought your daddy out here? No, you supposed to be scared. Cause if you ever put your hands on my son again, you ain't going to jail. I'm going to jail. That's All right, dad, how'd you know I was talking about me and not Greg? Chris, White kids don't snatch chains. Vanessa, look out! Ah, man, you owe me a car.

My fate was to become your greatest enemy. We meet for the very first time. As I was about to present myself to the world. You shut up. Dazzled the crowd. And then you save the crowd. You saw my greatest moment. I admire you. And you humiliated me. I Learned your name. And finally, I knew how to defeat you once and for all. Travel back in time. Kill you as a child.

You know what's amazing? Jesus, we need to pray. Do we really? The voice is on now. Run. I'll go get some sheets and Blankets. Oh, no, no, I'll do it. How long are we stuck with her? I don't know.

Welcome to the family. God help me. I want a cat. Hey, where were you? I went out for a little evening bike ride. What brings you by? I've decided to forgive you. I also wanted to apologize. Not your fault, about Rosco. My kid looked me in the eye and he said he didn't want to live with me. Do you have any idea how much that hurts? Actually, I do. On the bright side, I think Violet might be coming back. That might be my fault too.

You're the one who encouraged her to Mend fences with me, and I can't thank you enough. Did have a selfish motive. What do you mean? I can't wait to be a father. And you and Violet getting along will only make her a better mom. You can wait a little while, right? I'm not getting any younger. She wants to finish college, maybe even start a career before she has another baby. I'm sorry. Another baby? Are you telling me that Violet had a baby? I think it's charming. You giggle after sex. Who's ready for banana cream? What's wrong? Excuse me. What's going on? I assumed you told him about the baby. Oh, god. I do so much better when you are not in my life. If we leave now, we can get home in time to see the fourth quarter. It's Violet. Woo! VI, what's going on? I just wanted to apologize for what I said last night. She's apologizing? To who? To me. Why? No idea. I'm the one who should be apologizing. Should have told Gregory about the baby. Do you want to stay with Gregory? I do. Then if you hang in there and work it out, I guarantee you'll have him giggling again in no time. You think he'll forgive me? You're 22 years younger than he is. He'd forgive you for burning down his house. Thanks, mom.

He was trying to rob a bank, but had a little trouble with the getaway. Trying to split, huh? So glad you're stuck. I'd make a better criminal than any of them. Come on, I'm fairly certain you would be caught. All right, challenge accepted. What's the most valuable thing in your office? My medal of Valor. By midnight tonight, I could steal the metal of valor from your office. Why would I possibly agree to that? Because if I lose, I'll work the next five weekend, no overtime. But if I win, I have to do all of my paperwork. Tonight, the busiest and spookiest night of the year. I agree to participate. Alright. Are you in my ceiling? Peralta? Who are you talking to? There's no one up here. Placing it in a locked safe. The safe in turn, is locked in the cabinet. I'm off to my meeting. Good luck with your plan. You think that scares me? Nice costume, Peralta. Just a normal janitor pushing trash around. Come out of there. Kind of feel bad for him. He brought this on himself. What? No! Give me my keys. What do you say we call off the bet? Oh, I'm not letting you off the hook. Captain, sorry to interrupt. Some officers just arrested Peralta. Welcome to the endgame. You have five minutes until your deadline. Handcuffed to a table in a locked room. Captain, let me tell You? A little story come out of there. As it turns out, our friend Rosa is great at picking locks. It is a diversion. Not mistimed. You needed a way into the safe. The sergeant steals your phone. The greasiest smudges revealed the four numbers you used the most. Which meant there were 24 possible combinations for Charles to try. That could take up to four minutes. Which is why I really dragged out this explanation. How did you get everyone to help you? I told them that if we pulled this off, I would do all of their paperwork. And since you're doing all my paperwork. I'm impressed. Peralta. Well done, sir. He's not coming back. Jake Peralta is an amazing detective. Slash genius. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some paperwork to do. Alright.

I'm off to do some spot checks. She's totally gonna flunk us. When we first met, we had some good times. So when did it all go South? 1989. I was up for a big promotion which would have fast tracked my career. Once offered to write a letter on my behalf, but instead she torpedoed me because of something that happened the night before. She was a turned it in Madeline. I've had a couple that build up the nerve. I don't think we need to say anything. I'm gay. She sabotaged my career. Spot checks are done. Needless to say, I'm thoroughly underwhelmed. Excuse us, captain. The letter of recommendation she wrote for you 25 years ago. Where'd you get this? The point is the letter is very positive. You thought she wrote mean stuff about you because of. But she didn't. Wait a minute. You thought I cost you that promotion because you're gay? That's what you've been mad about all these years? Your sexual identity is the one thing I actually respect about you. Then what are you mad about? Because you tried to get me thrown off the force, because you shot me, because you were in the wrong position, you weren't following orders. Anything you'd like to Say to me before I complete my evaluation, never fail me if you must. Which failed? The 9:00 and their captain was fired. I'm not a man of unlimited cajoling. You better become one because I need you in command. This precinct needs you in command. Cajole up, captain. 2.7, mediocre, but enough for you to stick around. How did you get her to change her mind? You are now and always have been the superior police officer and the Derek Jeter thing was my fault. This is the best job I've ever had and it would be foolish to give it up over a petty feud. Here it's a grade for your performance these past two days. The letter grade. So to not be weird about it, an a. Thank you. Just curious, does your system have pluses in it or is like a the highest?

I'd like to cook him an impressive breakfast. Could you help orient me with that process? I'd be honored. Preparing food for one's lover is the most intimate gift of all. First step in learning how to cook is learning how to taste. Now describe what you taste. Jeez, try being more descriptive. I know you love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Why? Their components have long shelf life. They are cost effective. I was looking for more of an emotional connection. My favorite meal is a simple roast chicken and potatoes. It was the only dish my mother knew how to cook. What's your story behind a PB and J? I want a sandwich. You know, many people think that scrambled eggs are the easiest food to make. They are a highly nuanced and complicated dish. Nice and slow. You hear that sizzle? The heat is a little too high on. The higher the heat, the faster the eggs cook, the sooner Kevin eats. Am I incorrect? But we don't want to feed Kevin burned garbage. Cooking is about patience. Are you completely insane? The hand is the middle man. You know what? You, sir, are not ready to scramble eggs. Hand over your spatula. Fine. I'm just gonna make Kevin plain toast for breakfast. I smell burning. What you smell is the burning wreckage of my relationship with Holt. After our disagreement yesterday, I went online to read your culinary blogs and scoff. To my dismay, I actually Learned something about how food tells a story. So I made Kevin this. Warm. It's a croque, Monsieur. Kevin and I shared one on a rainy afternoon in Paris on our first anniversary. I'm sure it's not up to your standards, but Kevin seemed to enjoy it. Thank you for your guidance. Gross, huh? No, it's perfect. He's a natural chef. Now I know how Salieri felt.

Let the hostages go and take me instead. Not happening. Drop the weapons. Just gonna slowly put them down in front of me. Slowly put it up. Damn it. Terry time 18 minutes 28 seconds. You broke the record. Yes. Nice. Well done. All in a day's work. Elderly lady. I can't believe your final kill came with Scully's move. You went upside down cheese.

One of my best friends ran our school's black market, and he dealt in handmade custom knives. You see, his dad was a blacksmith and for some reason had no problem cranking out professional knives and even swords for his son to sell in school. It was the school's biggest kept secret. Till one time after Halloween, my friend sold to a kid who was known for being mentally unstable. I remember specifically telling him not to do it, but he shrugged me off, saying the kid was paying 25% more than the knife was worth and to not sell would be bad for business. Well, two days after he sold the knife, I was sitting in English literature class, which I happened to share with the kid who had bought the knife. We. We're just getting started discussing the themes of some shakespearean play, when the mentally unstable kid walked in like some sort of samurai. He proceeded to unsheathe a goddamn katana and just eyeballed the teacher. Every single student instantly got back against the wall as fast as we could, and I remember someone even peed themselves in fear. We all watched as the students started inching closer to the teacher, Tana in hand, muttering something to himself. Well, as soon as there was enough of an opening between him and the classroom door, everyone made a run for it, leaving the teacher completely alone. We all scattered and started screaming. Around the hallways, trying to draw attention. But by the time other staff members caught wind of what was happening, it was too late. Teacher was alive, but he was missing a hand, and the student was gone. From what came out in court later is that this teacher had previously done inappropriate things. We'll call it. To that student's sister. And so, as revenge, the student decided to take the teacher's hand. Questions about where he got the katana never actually came up, as the student just said he got it off the black market. And as a result, neither my friend nor his dad faced any legal consequences.

The accountant would check the Ledger to calculate how much each person was owed, and Danny carefully weighed out the exact amount using a balance scale. Gold panners used small funnels to pour the dust into their vials. One man stepped up, held a funnel over his bottle, and after Danny poured in the gold, he greedily scraped every last bit of residue into the funnel, making sure not a single speck was wasted. He then happily ran to the back of the group, gently shaking his bottle of glittering gold dust, a satisfied, content smile on his face. Once payroll was finished, everyone packed up, ready to leave, except Jack, who stood alone. He was the only one who hadn't gotten paid. Seeing that Danny and his crew were ignoring him, Jack rushed over to ask why he didn't receive any gold. Danny shot back, asking how many loads of sand he'd pan since arriving. Are you really here to mine gold, he asked. Then Danny pulled out several small bags of gold dust and tossed them at Jack. Jack quickly picked them up and asked why he was being given so much. Danny told him it was Severance pay, then turned around and walked away without another word.

Jack had come to Gongma a month earlier, hoping to strike gold. During the interview, James. James explained the rules of the site. Those selected by James were assigned jobs right away.

Honey, we were worried sick about you. Where have you been and why didn't you answer our call? I am so sorry. Brett's car broke down and my phone died and I just, none of that matters now. The important thing is that you're safe. I'm sorry. Okay. It'll never happen again, you writer, because you are grounded for the rest of your life now. Bring it in, baby. Surprise. Hmm. Moist. Sorry. Well, it's our own fault for trying to sneak up on a top clearance. Hi, that's my girl. The organization gave me top clearance. Welcome to the club, babe. Congrats on your new clearance, Casey.

Soon a few police wearing helmets holding Shields rushed in and dragged his panic stricken roommate away by force. Mark was shocked to see this scene, but after two days his roommate didn't come back and Jack from the opposite cell suddenly barged in and took away his roommate's bag of sugar. The righteous Mark fought for his roommate, reminding Jack that he shouldn't have taken other people's things without saying hello, which made him angry with Jack. So you want me your cards marked? And Jack took the sugar, not to eat, but all poured into the boiling kettle. Then Jack picked up the boiling hot sugar water out the door, splashing him in the face of the next door enemy. Mark realized that he had provoked a ruthless man. The next meal, Jack directly grabbed his chicken. The first time Mark did not say anything. When Mark was In line to make a phone call, Jack suddenly snatched the phone. He took up not just the roster, but the limited airtime for each inmate. And seeing that the people around him were watching coldly, Mark had to take the initiative to grab the phone. Give me the phone or I'll snap you! Mark didn't want to make a big deal out of it and put up with it this time. The next day, when Mark called his son, Jack once again grabbed his phone. Hey, give me back! Give me that back! This time, Mark just couldn't take it anymore, and he kept yelling in Jack's ear so that he couldn't talk to his family properly. He didn't expect Jack to hit him directly. Mark's nose was instantly bloody. All this was watched by Sean, the black boss next to him, who wondered why Mark never resisted. I'm a teacher. Because he is a teacher, he should be a civilized example. But Jack saw him as a good bully and started to provoke him when he moved, spitting in Mark's dinner plate and calling Mark a punk. But on this very day, Mark's turnaround came.

Yet one bearded man remained oblivious, continuing to assemble something. Monks, a top tier Secret Service agent immediately alerted his colleagues, but the radio signal was jammed. Monks slowly moved toward the space between the president and the man. You know, when I was a boy, a union job at the plant and honest hours. The guy with the beard, someone check out what he's doing. What was that? He's assembling something. I'm not sure what it provides. Good wages, health, safety. Two colleagues swiftly subdued the assassin. As a top tier Secret Service agent, monks knew he would be shot, yet he charged forward without hesitation. Fortunately, the bullet only grazed his shoulder. Afterward, the president personally visited monks in the hospital and he was hailed as a national hero who saved the country. Due to his injuries, monks took two years to recover. Recently, however, the murder of FBI Deputy Director Hawkins has intensified pressure on the Secret Service. The director activated reserve resources. Bonks having excelled as the former president's personal bodyguard was reassigned to the security detail. Yet once a hero who protected the president, he now found himself assigned to guard the Vice President's daughter and under the command of a 28 year old woman. Clearly, no one took him seriously anymore. I'm sorry. It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am. Eric's been with the Secret Service almost Two decades. You may have heard of him. Actually, he saved the last president a few years ago, that manufacturing plant in Ohio. You're the guy who got shot? Yes, ma'am. Still, monks was grateful just to be back on the job. The vice president's daughter, Honey Badger, had a strong personality but wasn't spoiled. Monks and his elegant junior partner, Elington, were primarily tasked with protecting Honey Badger during her college years. Her classmates and friends on campus were under Secret Service surveillance while her movements were restricted as long as Honey Badger notified them in advance, Ellington didn't overly restrict her freedom. Watching her best friend get asked to dance by other boys, Honey Badger couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment. Yet her figure still drew the attention of a man nearby. His sweet talk was flattering to Honey Badger, but she didn't know he was already aware of her identity. You think I don't know who your fascist father is? Fuck him and fuck you. Code 3, move in. Extract. Monks sprang into action upon receiving Eileen's orders, but the man landed a punch on his injured left arm. Just as the man prepared to strike again, Eileen and another agent intervened in time, recovering. Once restrained, the man who still wanted to fight Honey Badger was escorted out of the bar, ushered into a car and whisked away swiftly. Though no major incidents occurred, Ealington began questioning the veteran agent's competence two years out. Of work, combined with his injuries, had diminished Monk's performance. She'd heard rumors of his past cocaine use, which he didn't deny, though he insisted it was ancient history. A perfectionist in her work, eellington reported the matter to the director of the Secret Service, arguing that Monk's diminished capabilities would hinder her team.

Seeing this, the wife panicked instantly. The bathtub faucet was still running, and with her body fully paralyzed, she couldn't move at all. It was only a matter of time before the rising water would drown her. Desperate to survive, she focused all her strength on her right foot, the only part of her body with a trace of sensation, hoping to kick open the bathtub drain. But after several desperate attempts, not only did she fail to open the drain, she accidentally broke the metal chain attached to it. At this point, she was completely hopeless. Watching the water continue to rise, nearing her mouth and nose, she quickly shifted her focus and pinned her last hope on her left hand. She tried to use the shower hose to reach and turn off the faucet, but even that was agonizingly slow. Before she could get close enough, the water had already covered half her head, leaving only her eyes above the surface. Just as she was about to drown, she suddenly mustered a final burst of strength. Though she managed to slightly turn off the faucet, the rising water still left her in a life or death situation. With her last gasp of breath slipping away, she relaxed her body and let her right foot float. Upward! Then, with a sudden kick, she finally dislodged the bathtub drain. As the water level slowly dropped, her head broke through the surface, barely escaping death. But then she made an astonishing discovery. The near death experience had somehow triggered sensation in her body. She could move like a normal person again. Quickly, she placed both hands on the edge of the tub, trying to check on her unconscious husband. But eerily, the man who had just been lying there was now nowhere to be seen.

As he watched his grandson being born, the grandfather resolutely chose to leap off a cliff, offering himself for the cause. But what no one expected was that right after he jumped, the doctor discovered the woman had actually given birth to twins. This meant that one grandfather's death wasn't enough. Another person would have to die. The island council immediately convened to discuss what to do. Some suggested making an exception. After all, one extra baby wouldn't drastically upset the island's balance. But the island chief firmly opposed this idea. With deadly viruses ravaging the outside world, the island was one of the last safe havens. The population of exactly 513 must not be disturbed under any circumstances. In the end, they decided to activate a point based elimination system. Each islander had a personal score. Good deeds earn points. All bad behavior LED to deductions. The council gave the residents eight days. At the end of that period, the person with the lowest score would be executed. Curly, seeing his name third from the bottom, jumped up in fear. If he ended up being chosen, his fate would be sealed. The thought alone made his legs go weak with panic. But Nick, sitting beside him, whispered not to worry. His mother was the island chief and when the time came, he promised he'd find a way. To help curly avoid elimination, second to last was an old woman. Her eccentric personality had made her unpopular with the others. Now elderly and frail, she could no longer work the fields and likely had no chance of earning more points to climb the ranking. But even so, the man at the very bottom of the list, the chubby guy, was the most innocent of them all.

This couple spent a fortune to dine at an exclusive restaurant, but the very first course left them speechless. The chef simply mixed flour and water, then served a colorful dish made entirely from various plant colors. The small portion was meant to remind everyone to cherish food, but it felt more like an art piece than a meal. Most guests felt tricked, but not Tyler. He ate with great enthusiasm. The second course was even stranger, a small serving of roasted chicken thigh with a corn tortilla. At first glance, it seemed normal, but upon closer inspection, the tortilla had bizarre patterns seared into it. For example, the tortillas of three tech CEOs displayed evidence of their tax evasion burned into the fabric. The tortillas served to a wealthy old man featured a photo of him secretly meeting a young woman. That's right. Each guest tortilla displayed their past wrongdoings. After this, no one had any appetite left. Only Tyler kept happily eating. After all, the meal cost as much as a Rolex. Then came the third course, which was downright horrifying. The chef called it chaos. The staff laid white sheets across the floor and covered them with Rosemary. Then the sous chef appeared, bowed deeply and suddenly pulled out a gun and shot himself. The effect was immediate. The restaurant descended into chaos. Waiters rushed to serve the next dish, but aside from Tyler, no One had the heart to eat. Everyone just wanted to escape. But the restaurant had already been sealed shut. Finally, the chef revealed his true intention. He planned to kill everyone.

Once the clay had fully softened, he shaped it into a pistol, pressing it into a pre made mold with all his strength. Just like that, a fake gun was complete. He knocked on a door and handed the clay gun to his waiting accomplice. The hijackers stormed into the cabin aggressively. Everyone on board was stunned. Two more accomplices emerged and in moments, the three hijackers had taken control of the passengers. They grabbed a flight attendant and demanded she reveal the identity of the air marshal on board. To avoid putting the passengers in danger, the marshal had no choice but to surrender. Under threat, he handed over his weapon. Just then, brave passenger stood up and called for others to help. But everyone froze in fear. No one dared move. The hijackers beat the man brutally. When he collapsed to the floor unmoving, the cabin fell into a heavy silence. The hijackers then raised a banner and shouted slogans from a known terrorist group. Meanwhile, the pilot noticed something was wrong. He quickly changed the transponder code to 750, a silent alert signaling a hijacking. Air traffic control picked up the distress signal almost immediately. But then a passenger who had tried to secretly film the incident was caught. To tighten control, the hijackers confiscated everyone's phones and forced all passengers into the economy cabin next They took the flight attendant hostage again, demanding the pilot open the cockpit door. The pilot refused. Frustrated, the hijackers turned to calling the government, demanding the release of their leader. What no one realized, however, was that the hijackers weren't the only criminals on the plane. One man's suspicious glances and secretive behavior hinted at a deeper plot. He seemed to know the flight attendant. The real target wasn't the plane or the passengers. It was the one dollar and twenty cents to two billion dollar worth of diamonds hidden on board.

I was 6 years old when my dad woke me up at 2:00am to go to McDonald's. And as if that wasn't weird enough, when we came back, I couldn't find my teddy bear, Bobby anywhere. When I started crying, my dad promised that we'd search in the morning, but when I brought it up again, he looked really angry. Well, six year old me figured that he was just overcome with grief for Bobby, so I never mentioned it again until a few weeks ago when we were out grocery shopping, because that's when I saw a teddy bear that looked just like Bobby. I started reminiscing about how I used to take that thing everywhere, acted like it was really paying attention to me. And suddenly my dad started shouting at the top of his lungs, enough about the damn bear! Just let it go! So now I knew something was up. You see, my dad is the calmest man I know, and that was the first time I've heard him shout in years. When we got back home, I gave him a few hours to cool off before bringing it up again. And this time he just sighed and said, I took you to McDonald's for a reason that night. But before I could say anything, he started telling me how I used to bring Bobby everywhere. Apparently, if someone even suggested that I Go somewhere without it. I would start stomping my feet and screaming. I laughed, thinking that was funny, but my dad's face was as serious as ever. He told me that after my tantrum, his paternal instinct went into overdrive, and he took a deep look at Bobby. And that's when his heart dropped, because in the left eye of Bobby was what looked like a camera lens. So that night, we went to McDonald's, and while I was distracted, my dad stole the teddy and later lit it on fire. At this point, tears were streaming down my face. But my dad's story wasn't over yet, because the next day, without telling anyone, he went back to the store that sold it to us. Well, it was less of a store and more of one of those stands on an empty street, but still, he noticed a lens in every one of the teddy bears being sold. Apparently, he wailed on the shopkeeper until he confessed to it and didn't stop until he agreed to burn the rest of the teddy bears to the ground. I still don't know how to feel.

So I told her not to bring anything to Thanksgiving this year so the guests could actually enjoy the food. Last Thanksgiving she made deconstructed stuffing, which was literally just torn bread cubes floating in a bowl of lukewarm chicken broth. She called it rustic and artisanal. The year before that, her mashed potatoes had chunks of raw garlic the size of quarters that made my seven year old nephew cry actual tears at the dinner table. Two Christmases ago, she brought a ham glazed with what she claimed was honey and brown sugar. It was Nutella, straight Nutella smeared on a ham. My dad took one bite, excuse, used himself to the bathroom and we didn't see him for 20 minutes. So this year I'm hosting Thanksgiving at my house and I very gently suggested she could bring wine or rolls instead of cooking. She told me I was unsupportive of her culinary journey and hung up on me. I should have known that wouldn't be the end of it. Two days before Thanksgiving, my mom calls me in a panic. My sister's been posting on Facebook about bringing her famous turducken to dinner. I don't even follow her anymore because of stuff like this, but mom screenshots everything. I go to her page and my stomach drops. She's posted progress photos. Day 1 shows a raw chicken stuffed inside a raw duck stuffed inside a raw Turkey. All Sitting on her kitchen counter, day 2, same photo, same counter. Day 3, she's added caption, letting the flavors marry and deepen. It's been sitting at room temperature for three days. I immediately call her. Caitlin, please tell me you've been refrigerating that thing. It's marinating in its own flavors, she says like she's some kind of chef. You wouldn't understand the process. I tried explaining basic food safety. She accused me of trying to sabotage her confidence and said I was jealous of her cooking skills. Then she hung up again. I called my mom back and begged her to intervene. She said, just let her bring it, honey. We don't want to hurt her feelings. I asked. She wanted to hurt everyone's stomachs instead. She told me I was being dramatic. Thanksgiving Day arrives. I've got a beautiful spread ready, maple glazed ham, real mashed potatoes, green bean casserole that doesn't have sardines in it. Everything's perfect. Then my sister walks in carrying this massive aluminum roasting pan. I'm covered in oil. The smell hits me immediately. Even through the oil, it's like death had a sento file. She sets it on the counter with this proud smile and says, wait until you see this masterpiece. I lift one corner of the oil and nearly gag. The turtleneck is gray, not golden brown, not even pale. It's gray, like concrete gray. And it's glistening in a way that meat should never glisten. My dad walks into the kitchen. Takes one look and says, no, I'm ordering pizza. He pulls out his phone. Right there, my sister's face crumbles. Nobody ever supports my cooking. You're all against me. That's when my Uncle Steve walks over. I should mention Uncle Steve is a health inspector for the county. He's been doing.

Mom and dad were worth millions, built their company from nothing, lived in a mansion that looked like it was ripped from Architectural Digest. Every family gathering was a networking event where my siblings would pitch their latest business ideas or drop hints about their financial struggles. The four of us had always assumed we'd split everything equally when they died. We assumed wrong. The lawyer's office was packed. My brother Beckham flew in from Dubai, where he was closing deals. My sister Harley interrupted her honeymoon in Bali. My other brother, Felix, brought his lawyer, already prepared to contest whatever the will said. I came straight from my shift at the hospital where I work as a nurse. Your parents left specific instructions, the lawyer said. Pulling up a projector screen. Your inheritance will be determined by your score on this quiz, a Kahoot game loaded on the screen. Family trivia, 50 questions. The lawyer handed us tablets. This is insane, Beckham said. They can't be serious. Question 1, the lawyer read. What was your mother's middle name? I typed Lorelei. Felix typed Lauren. Beckham and Harley were frantically texting each other. The results flashed on screen. Only I got it right. Question 2, what was your father's first job? I typed janitor. My siblings put various tech positions wrong, wrong, wrong. By question 10, the pattern was clear. Beckham had three correct Harley had two. Felix had four. I had 10. What medication did mom take daily? I knew it was metformin for her diabetes. My siblings didn't even know she was diabetic. Dad's biggest fear? Heights. He told me during our monthly lunches when my siblings were too busy to show up. The name of Mom's chemotherapy nurse? Alyssa. I knew because I went to every appointment. Mom had cancer. Harley yelled, this is bullshit. Beckham stood up. How are we supposed to know mom had cancer? She never told us she did. I said quietly at Sunday dinners. You just never came. The questions got more personal. What made dad cry at his 70th birthday? I typed, when no one but Jocelyn me showed up. Correct. What was Mom's favorite book? The one I gave her last Christmas. My siblings hadn't given gifts in years, just sent assistance with gift cards. Did your parents have their first date? The diner on Fifth Street. Dad told the story every anniversary dinner. I was the only child who attended them. Beckham threw his tablet down at question 30. This is rigged. You obviously help them make this. When did your parents renew their vows? Last summer in their backyard. I was the only witness. My siblings were at various retreats, conferences and yacht parties. What surgery did dad have? In 2,019? Triple bypass. They were all too busy to visit. I took three weeks off work. The final question appeared. What did your Parents value most, I typed, being seen as people, not checkbooks. The final scores flashed me, 48 out of 50. Felix, 7 out of 50. Beckham, 5 out of 50. Harley, 4 out of 50. The lawyer clicked to the next screen. A video message from my parents appeared. If you're watching this.

Then my dad died. And suddenly I existed again. My brother called me for the first time in three years, not to ask how I was doing, to tell me the funeral arrangements. I said okay and hung up. At the funeral, my siblings swarmed me. Fake hugs, fake tears. My sister kept saying how we needed to together as a family now. I just nodded. I knew what was coming. But here's what broke me. During the service, people kept coming up to me with stories about my dad. His coworker told me how dad kept a photo of me on his desk. How he'd brag about my promotion at work. I didn't even know he knew about my promotion. I never told him because I thought he didn't care. My neighbour, this old woman I've never met, grabbed my hand. She said dad talked about me every Sunday when he saw her at the grocery store. About how proud he was that I was making it on my own. I reminded him of his own mother, strong and independent. I stood there crying, realising my dad saw everything. He saw me being ignored at family dinners. He saw my siblings walk past me like I was furniture. He saw me stop coming to holidays because it hurt too much to be in a room full of people who acted like I was a stranger. And he never said anything to them. But he saw Me. My sister noticed me crying and actually rolled her eyes, whispered to my brother. She's always so dramatic. Like I was performing grief instead of feeling it. Two weeks later, the lawyer called us in for the will reading. My brother and sister showed up in designer clothes, already arguing about who should get the house. My sister was on her phone looking up property values. My brother had literally brought a calculator. I sat in the corner in my work uniform, still wearing my name tag from my shift. I taken the bus there because my car was in the shop and I couldn't afford the repair yet. They didn't ask if I needed a ride. They didn't even ask how I was getting there. The lawyer asked if everyone was present. My sister didn't even look at me when she said yes. Then he started reading. Dad left everything to my siblings. The house, the cars, his savings, his investment accounts. They were smiling, nodding. My brother already texting someone. My sister was literally sketching kitchen renovation plans on her notepad. I felt sick, but also I felt nothing. Like, of course, of course this is how it would go. Then the lawyer said, however, there's a condition. The room went cold. My sister's pen stopped moving. Before they can access any inheritance, each sibling must tell one specific memory they have of spending time with their youngest sister. One genuine memory of time spent together. Just One, my brother's face went white. My sister started stammering. Well, to continue, tap the arrow in the bottom right corner and copy the link. Then tap the CapCut icon in the bottom left. Finally, click the red button. When I pulled out the tampon in front of her, she actually gagged. We need to admit you, she said, covering her mouth. Hospital, day one. I

I paused, looked around and said, I never got any money. The entire table went silent. You could hear the clinking of silverware from other tables, but at ours, dead quiet. My parents froze. My dad's fork literally clattered onto his plate and my mom's hand started shaking as she reached for her wine glass. What do you mean you never got any money? Grandma asked. Voice getting that sharp edge I remembered from when she caught my cousins lying as kids. My mom cleared her throat nervously. Mother, we can explain this later. No, grandma's voice cut through the air like a knight. Explain it now. I've been sending three thousand dollar checks to Monica every single month since Aubrey started college. Where is that money? My brain was spinning. Three thousand dollars a month for four years? I started doing the math in my head while everyone stared at me. That's when my little sister Savannah, who'd been scrolling through Instagram this whole time, suddenly looked up. Oh, wait, is that where mom got the money for my BMW? If the table was quiet before, now it was like a tomb. Savannah, shut up, my mom hissed. But it was too late. And my spring break trip to Cancun last month, Savannah continued, completely oblivious to the horror spreading across everyone's faces. And that designer Bag you bought me for Christmas. I felt like I was watching my life in slow motion. Four years, four brutal years of working three jobs just to afford ramen noodles and textbook. 60 hour work weeks while my parents took family vacations. Sleeping in a moldy basement apartment while my sister got a luxury car you stole from me, I said. My voice barely a whisper. My dad finally found his voice. Aubrey, Sweetheart, it's not what it looks like, really. I stood up, my chair scraping against the floor because it looks like you watched me destroy my health working multiple jobs while you used my money to spoil Savannah. The restaurant felt like it was spinning. I remembered all those phone calls home begging for help with textbooks, with rent, with groceries. All those times they said money was tight. They couldn't help. I needed to learn responsibility. How much? Grandma's boy, it was ice cold. I did the math out loud, my voice getting stronger with each No. 3,000 * 12 months times four years, $144,000. My mom started crying. We were going to pay it back when you graduated. With what money? I laughed, but there was no humor in it. You don't have that kind of cash lying around. You spend it all on Savannah's lifestyle. Savannah finally looked up from her phone realizing this was about her. Wait, so I have to give the car back? Are you serious right now? I turned To her, you're worried about keeping a car that was bought with stolen money while I've been eating peanut butter sandwiches for dinner. That's when Uncle Stewart, who'd been unusually quiet, spoke up. Monica, please tell me you didn't actually steal from your own daughter. My mom's mascara was running down her cheeks. We thought, we thought we could replace it before she found out. Replace it how? Grandma demanded, by letting her work herself to death. I remembered the night last semester when I fainted at work from exhaustion. The man manager had to drive me to urgent care because I couldn't afford an ambulance. I'd called my parents crying, telling them I didn't know how much more I could take. They told me to push through it. That success requires.

She got really mad, started yelling at him about how he knows she doesn't consume animal products, how it's not just a preference but something she cares about. He kept saying it was just a joke and she was overreacting. That's why he asked me to meet him outside instead of going to the house. She told him she didn't want to see him for the rest of the day. Dad looked at me across the table and said, that's funny, right? Like he wanted me to agree with him, to laugh about it. I just sat there for a second. Then I pulled a face and said, don't think so, dad, because I really couldn't see how it was funny. His whole expression changed. He looked annoyed, maybe even angry. He said people these days can't take a joke anymore, that everyone's too sensitive. Then he said, I'm his son and I'm supposed to side with him, that I shouldn't be judgmental since it was harmless, just milk and coffee, no big deal. I told him it wasn't harmless, though. She's vegan for a reason. He made her consume something she specifically avoids on purpose just to mess with her. He waved his hand like I was being dramatic, said it's not like she's allergic, it's just a choice. I said, yeah, it's her choice. And he ignored it to Prank her. He got quiet after that, finished his coffee without looking at me. Then he said, I've changed that I used to laugh at his jokes when I was younger. I told him I was a kid then I didn't really get that his pranks upset people. Now I'm older and I can see when something's mean instead of funny. He didn't like that answer. We left the cafe 20 minutes later, dropped me off at Mom's house early. Didn't even come inside. Just said, see you next week and drove off. When I got inside, mom asked why I was back so soon. I told her what happened. She shook her head and said, your dad never grew up. Some people think pranks are a personality trait instead of just being annoying.

My aunt Sharon said, this is ridiculous. How are we supposed to function? But I looked at my phone. The screen time report said 11 hours a day. I was the worst one there. I will do it.

Day 8, I had a full panic attack at a restaurant because I could not look up the menu online. The waiter had to talk me through the options like I was a child. Day 10, Emma started her campaign. She texted the family group chat, he is definitely cheating. Check his Laptop? No way he is lasting. The lawyer confirmed I had not touched any device. My mom vouched for me that I was using a flip phone only for emergencies. Day 15 was the hardest. My best friend got engaged and everyone was celebrating in the group chat.

I was chilling on my bed with my roommate when I got a Snapchat ad from quick add. His name was Connor and I was bored so I added him back because why not? In our first convo he was super chill and talked about normal stuff. Relationships, family drama, stuff like that. That's when he asked how old I was. My roommate Audrey grabbed my phone and started typing for me oh, I'm actually 15. How old are you? And I was dying laughing as at the time I was really 21. But when we saw his response our laughter died in our throats. He said, oh wow, that's young. I'm 28, but I hope we can keep talking. You seem really mature and I'm sure you're really cute. LOL heart emoji. Me and Audrey just stared at each other. Was this man for real? He was using all the classic signs of grooming, not even trying to hide it. I should have blocked him right there, something made me curious about how far this creep would actually go. So me and Audrey responded with thanks Poppy and laughed. Over the next few days, Connor kept messaging me these weird compliments about how I was different from other girls my age and how he wished he could help take care of me. Then one night after we've been playing those stupid Snapchat Games for like three hours straight. He sent me something that changed everything. $100, the message said for being so sweet and making my nights less lonely. I stared at my phone screen and screenshot it for Audrey. A hundred dollars for literally just sending Snapchats back and forth. Audrey replied saying milk him dry. The moral part of my brain was screaming at me saying this wasn't the right thing to do. But the other side of me, the broke college student who didn't want to work.

My classmate Trixie would have thrown another girl into a pit of snakes if it meant getting a crumb of male attention. She only hung out with guys, refused to wear anything feminine, put down other girls like she was paid to do it. At lunch, she'd make fun of girls wearing makeup while literally having her own mascara and foundation on. But if you asked her about it, she'd swear her natural skin just load like that. Her Instagram was full of call of duty screenshots with captions like, most girls don't even know what this is. And one of the boys. But the one thing Trixie loved more than setting women back generations was a senior named Warren. He was popular, played varsity basketball, actually seemed like a good guy. Trixie had been mocking other girls, trying to get his attention for three years. But then Warren asked me out. Not her. Me. It was after school, in the hallway by my locker. I was surprised, but I thought he was cute, so I said yes. We made plans for that Friday on the spot. And when he walked off, I saw Trixie staring at us across the hall. Her face went pale, then bright red. She turned and walked away fast. The next two weeks were. Well, Trixie tried everything. At lunch, she sat next to me and Warren. Hey, girl, I wanted to ask if You wanted to throw a football around with me later. She then smiled condescendingly. Oh, wait. You probably don't even know how to make it spiral. Warren didn't even look at her. She doesn't need to throw footballs to be cool. Trixie forced to laugh. I know. I'm just saying I'm surprised you're with someone so unlike you. Between classes, she accidentally bumped into me. Spilled her black coffee. She said lattes were for girls only. All over my white shirt. Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Now everyone can see through your shirt. This is so embarrassing. She posted old photos with Warren on Instagram. Captions. Like real ones, remember? And day ones. It was almost amusing.

I don't have time for this. He grabbed my arm. Please, you need to stop seeing Warren. You need to break up with him. I stopped, stared at her. What? I'm not friends with him anymore. Just trust me. Please break up with him. I looked her up and down. Is this another of your weird pick me things? Her voice cracked. It's not. I'm serious. Just please trust me. I saw. Why should I?

I slept in a bus station bathroom that night. I cut contact and never looked back until last month when a baby shower invite arrived with a handwritten note from my mother. My dad didn't even look at me when he said it, just gripped the steering wheel and muttered, you're old enough, figure it out. The van pulled away, no bag, no phone, just me and $5. That night, I slept curled up in a Greyhound station bathroom stall. A janitor found me two days later. Social services got involved, but my parents convinced everyone I was a runaway seeking attention. After two months in a group home, they sent me back with a warning. I was their scapegoat. My younger sister, Daisy, golden child. She could throw tantrums. In church, they'd call her spirited. I spilled milk, cold stairs and silent treatment for days. By 16, I was working under the table at a diner, hiding cash behind a loose tile in my closet. Every dollar I saved felt like a brick in the wall between me and them. The day I turned 18, I left no note, just packed what little I had and took bus three towns over nine years of silence, I blocked them, changed my number, rebuilt my life from nothing. I thought I was free. Then the invitation arrived, soft pastels, a cartoon stork Join us to celebrate baby Dawson. And tucked behind it, a note in my mother's handwriting. Nathan, we'd really love to see you again. It's time to put the past behind us. Family should stick together, mom. I didn't respond, but I started digging. Daisy's Instagram was a pastel nightmare of blessed hashtags and nursery tours. Then I saw my mom's comment. You've always been our shining light. That's when it all clicked. A week later, another letter. My dad's messy scrawl, stop being selfish. Your sister needs you. Show up or don't bother coming back. Then the real bombshell hit. I accidentally got C C on an email from their lawyer. It was their will. Every asset, every account left Daisy at the bottom. Our son, Nathaniel has been estranged for many years and has made it clear he wants no relationship with this family. They were erasing me legally. But that wasn't all. A friend in cyber security helped me dig deeper. What I found made my blood freeze. Bank statements showing a trust fund in my name that I never knew existed. My grandmother had left money for both of us. Mine had been drained over years for educational expenses. I never went to college. I never saw a cent. They'd stolen over $47,000. Then I found the spreadsheets literally titled estrangement strategy and PR planning. Nathaniel, see, they planned my removal, documented it, branded me as the troubled black sheep who abandoned them. My mother had Even told their church I stole money before disappearing. That's when Daisy reached out, a desperate letter, not an invitation. She'd found their files. She was terrified, not for herself, but for her unborn son. She'd finally seen what they really were.

So last summer I was getting ready for this pool party at my friend Jess's house. Like 40 people were gonna be there from our high school and I was super nervous because my ex would be there with his new girlfriend. Jess had given me this bikini a week before as a joke gift for my birthday. It was this tiny bright neon green string thing that barely covered anything. Top was basically two triangles and the bottoms were like dental floss. She said she found it at some sketchy online store and thought it would be funny. I tried it on and honestly, it looked amazing on me, way better than my usual boring black one piece. But it was definitely meant to be a gag gift. This size was somehow perfect though. Like it fit me better than any swimsuit I'd ever owned. I kept staring at myself in the mirror thinking maybe I should just wear it for real. The day of the party, I'm standing in my room holding both suits, my safe black one piece that made me look like a mom or the neon green string situation that made me look like I belonged in a music video. I kept thinking about how my ex Tyler dumped me three months ago saying I was too conservative and boring in bed. His new girlfriend, Madison, was this wild party girl who posted thirst traps everyday. So I said screw it and put on the green bikini. I threw a cover up over it and drove to Jess's house. When I got there, the party was already going strong. Music was blasting. People were jumping in the pool and I could smell the barbecue from the backyard. I found Jess by the snack table and she nearly choked on her drink when she saw me. She was like, oh, my god, you actually wore it and started laughing. I told her I wanted to try something different. She said I looked incredible but also asked if I was sure about it. Before I could answer, Tyler walked up behind me. I turned around and his jaw literally dropped. He couldn't even form words for like 10 seconds. Then Madison appeared next to him in this cute but basic polka dot bikini. She looked me up and down with this weird expression like she couldn't figure out if she should be impressed or annoyed. Tyler kept staring at me and I could tell Madison was getting pissed. I decided to own it and took off my cover up. Every conversation around the pool basically stopped. Guys were trying not to stare but totally failing. Even some of the girls were checking me out. I walked over to the pool edge and dove in like it was no big deal. But inside I was freaking out. The rest of the party was insane. Suddenly everyone wanted to talk. To me, guys who had never noticed me before were offering to get me drinks and asking for my number. Girls were asking where I got my bikini. Even the popular seniors were including me in their conversations. The best part was watching Tyler. He kept trying to get close to me and start conversations. At one point, he literally said, you look different. And I just shrugged and said, same me, different swimsuit. Madison was getting more and more jealous. She kept trying to do these dramatic poses and splash around to get attention back.

I said. So we'll do exactly what she wants. Within an hour, chaos began. Managers, supervisors and regional directors were getting hundreds of email updates. Ticket viewed, ticket note saved, ticket reopened. Their inboxes filled non stop. Some begged to be removed from updates. Others sent angry messages demanding to know what was going on. Then the exchange servers crashed completely. I set up an automatic email reply. Thank you for your message. Our new transparency policy ensures you receive every update as it happens. We appreciate your patience. It wasn't long before the CEO came storming into the help desk room. What's happening? He demanded. I pointed to the CTO's email on my screen. Just following orders, sir. His eyes narrowed. Follow me. We walked down the hall. He stopped by the director's office, then the old interim CTOs, and finally the new CTOs, growling at each. In my office now. Once inside, he looked around. Someone explain this mess. I restated her instructions and showed the email. She jumped in. I was trying to improve communication, the director said. Jerry tried to warn you it would trigger spam filters. Former interim CTO nodded. He even had a plan to update tickets once daily, but she wouldn't listen. The CEO turned to her. You didn't listen to him? She muttered something about her experience, but he cut her off. Experience doesn't excuse not listening to your own team. We've just shut down our Email network. He told the rest of us to leave. I later heard he had a long, unpleasant talk with her about leadership and consequences. By the end of the day, the network team restored everything, and I sent an official apology email explaining that a new update schedule was in place. A few days later, the CTO was placed on unpaid leave while they conducted an internal review. I stayed a few more months, but things turned bitter after she returned. She blamed me, the director, everyone. Eventually, I left for a better company. Months later, one of my old finance contacts called. Apparently, the CTO and a few others had been caught taking money from a vendor to keep their contracts active. A payroll audit revealed the irregularities, and soon enough, officials showed up at headquarters and escorted them out. Turns out, sometimes you don't have to lift a finger. People like that destroy themselves just fine.

I sold my gaming PC for $800 without telling her first. I've had that thing since college. Built it myself sophomore year with my roommate. Spent every penny from my summer job on it. But I barely touched it in the past two years. Maybe turned it on twice. Meanwhile our AC completely died during a 95 degree heat wave and the repair company quoted us 750 dollars. We had exactly 200 dollars in our checking account and payday wasn't until next Friday, 9 days away. I posted the PC on Facebook marketplace at 9:00am with detailed specs and photos. By two PM some college kid showed up at our door with 800 dollar cash. Didn't even try to negotiate. I handed 750 dollars to the AC guy who was scheduled for three PM, kept 50 dollars for gas money, and thought I was being responsible, possible, and smart. My wife got home from work at 6 and walked straight into my office like she always does. She froze in the doorway. Where's your computer? Did someone break in? I explained the whole situation, showed her the AC receipt on the counter, even pulled up the Facebook messages on my phone. She stared at the receipt for a solid 10 seconds, then her face went red and she said you sold something worth $800 without even texting me? That's a major financial decision I. I tried explaining it was technically mine from before we got married. It was collecting dust and we desperately needed the AC fixed or we'd be sleeping in a sauna. She cut me off mid sentence. I. I don't care whose it was. Legally we're married now. You should have called me at lunch. I would have said yes. But you didn't even ask. Then came the punishment. Sleep on the couch tonight. I actually laughed out loud because I thought she was joking. We have a guest bedroom right across the hall with a full size bed that literally nobody uses except when her parents visit twice a year. Why would I fold my 6.2 frame onto our tiny, uncomfortable couch when there's a perfectly good empty room 10 feet away? I told her that exact logic. She got even more furious. The couch is the entire point. It's supposed to be uncomfortable. That's how you show you're actually sorry for what you did. I refused. This wasn't me coming home drunk or forgetting her birthday or anything that actually deserved punishment. I fixed our AC during a heat wave with my own property. I grabbed my pillow and phone charger and went straight to the guest room. Slept absolutely amazing. Actually way better than our 10 year old saggy mattress that desperately needs replacing but we can't afford right now. At 6:00am she barged into the guest room without knocking and turned on the lights. Why didn't You sleep on the couch like I specifically told you to. I was genuinely confused. Thought maybe she was joking again, because there's a bedroom right here with a real bed. Why would anyone choose a couch? She sat down on the edge of the bed and her tone got dead serious. Gave me this whole speech about marriage and respect. About how when one spouse tells the other to sleep on the couch, they're supposed to do it exactly as instructed. Not find a comfortable loophole, not use logic to get around it. Just do it to prove you respect a relationship and feel genuine remorse for your actions. I sat up and looked at her. I was being punished for using my own gaming PC to fix our broken AC during summer. What exactly am I supposed to feel remorse about? That was apparently the completely wrong thing to say. She stood up and said it stopped being about the PC the moment I refused to follow her clear instructions. That I was being deliberately difficult and dismissive of her feelings, that choosing the guest room was me being a smart ass and trying to win on a technicality. I asked what she actually wanted me to say, and she just walked out and slammed the door hard. Now it's been three full days of this Cold War. She barely speaks to me, sleeps with her back turned to my side, makes her own separate dinner, and eats It alone in the bedroom. This morning, her mom called me at work saying I need to stop being so stubborn and just a apologize already. That I'm making a huge deal out of something small. Small? I'm the one who solved our AC crisis, and somehow I'm still the bad guy here. My coworker says his wife pulls the exact same couch thing, and he just does it every time to keep the peace. Says it's not worth the fight. But I'm not apologizing for choosing a bed over a couch when I didn't even do anything wrong in the first place.

We've been separated for three weeks. When she texted me at midnight, can we talk just once face to face? I ignored it. Then she sent another, please. I won't beg. I just need to see you. Against my better judgment, I agreed to meet at the house while the kids were at school. I figured she wanted to discuss custody or divide up the bank accounts, maybe finally sign the papers her lawyer kept threatening to file. I walked in expect thinking her to be cold, distant. Instead, she cleaned the entire house. There were fresh flowers on the kitchen table, the expensive ones from that boutique she always said were too pricey. And sitting on the counter was a bottle of Jameson, the 18 year Reserve, my favorite whiskey we banned from our home six years ago after I came home drunk from my buddy's bachelor party. It's for you, she said, barely making eye contact. If you come home, you can drink whatever you want, whenever you want. I was wrong about that rule. I told her this wasn't about alcohol. We both knew that our problems ran deeper than house rules. Her hands were shaking as she poured herself water. Then what is it about? Because I need to know. I need to fix it. Tell me what to fix. I explained that some things can't be fixed with grand gestures, that we've Been broken for years and just refused to admit it, that the separation actually felt like relief. That's when her voice cracked. So there's nothing, nothing I can do. I stayed quiet. She started listing things, desperate things. I could go out with my friends anytime I wanted. No more asking permission or guilt trips. I could have my own space in the house, convert the spare room into whatever I wanted. She'd stop complaining about my family visiting every weekend. She'd stop nagging about the dishes, about my job, about everything. I just stood there watching my wife of 12 years unravel in front of me. What if, she paused, took a shaky breath. What if you could do whatever you wanted, see whoever you wanted? And I just, I wouldn't ask questions. I asked her what she meant. I needed to hear her say it. I mean, her eyes filled with tears. I mean, if you wanted to be with someone else, I wouldn't stop you. You could go out, meet people, do whatever makes you happy. Just come home after. That's all I'm asking. My wife, the woman who once didn't speak to me for two days because I hugged my ex girlfriend at a mutual friend's wedding, was offering me permission to cheat. I asked if she understood what she was actually saying. I know exactly what I'm saying, she whispered, tears running down her face. Now you could sleep with other women. I won't ask About it. I won't check your phone. We'll just pretend it never happened. Be here when you get home. I'll cook dinner. I'll smile at you. I'll be whatever you need. I just need you to come back. The desperation in her voice made my stomach turn. This wasn't love. This was fear wrapped in surrender. I asked her why, why she'd humiliate herself like this, why she thought this was the answer. She looked at the floor, her voice barely audible. Cause I'd rather share you than lose you completely. I can't do this alone. The house is too quiet. The kids keep asking when you're coming home. Our daughter cried herself to sleep last night asking if this was her fault. I wake up every morning and forget you're gone for just a second and then I remember and it feels like I'm dying all over again. That's when it hit me. She wasn't fighting for our marriage. She was fighting against being a single mom, against being alone, against admitting failure to her family who'd warned her about marrying young, against facing all those people who'd congratulated us at our wedding. I sat down at the kitchen table and told her the truth, that if she was this desperate, this willing to destroy her own self respect just to avoid being alone, then maybe we were more broken than I thought. But I also told her something else, that I'd come home not because of her offers. I'd know not because she was willing to let me cheat, but because clearly we both needed help neither of us could give alone. One condition, though, marriage counseling, twice a week minimum, starting immediately, non negotiable. And if she ever offered to let me cheat again, I'd walk out that door permanently. She grabbed her phone before I even finished the sentence, called her therapist right there in front of me, voice still shaking, mascara running down her cheeks, asking for the best marriage counselor she knew he was. Writing down the name and number like her life depended on it. Got us an appointment for Monday morning at 9. I'm sitting in my sister's apartment right now packing my things to move back home tomorrow. Part of me wonders if I'm making a mistake. If you have to beg someone to let you cheat just to keep them around, is that really a marriage worth saving? But the look on her face when I said I'd come back like I just pulled her from drowning, that's haunting me, too. Our first session is in three days. I have no idea what I'm doing.

So I took away his business, marriage, kids and freedom. My dad has 3 older siblings who made his childhood hell because he was darker skinned than them. They were racist bullies and the worst was my oldest uncle, a complete snob who thought he was better than everyone. The abuse messed up my dad so badly he became an alcoholic, which made my childhood pretty rough, too. These uncles stole everything my dad inherited when my grandfather died, a house, land and money that could have gotten us to middle class at least. Instead, we stayed dirt poor while they looked down on us. I hadn't seen this uncle since I was 7 years old. Then three days after I failed my final exam, he showed up at our house uninvited. My mom sat him down for small talk, then called me over. He looked at me with this smug smile and said, oh, look how much you've grown. You look just like your dad. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Even in terms of success, you're following his footsteps. Then he let out the most evil, sarcastic laugh I've ever heard. I said, what do you mean by that? He said, well, I heard you failed high school. Guess this branch of the family is bound to be the loser side. I told him to shut his mouth and get Out. Nobody wanted him here anyway. That's when he said, I guess your trash mom didn't raise you well. What did I expect from hood rats like you? We got into a screaming match and he left. But I couldn't forget the humiliation. I decided right then I would get revenge somehow. I started digging into his life, weeks researching everything about him. What I discovered was gold. All his business and assets were in his wife's name. He technically owned nothing. Turns out he committed massive tax fraud, ripped off business partners and declared bankruptcy and transferred everything to his wife, to odge at all. I found former employees who hated his guts. They said if this ever went to court, they'd testify about how he treated them like garbage while they worked for him. I kept building my case, collecting information, waiting for the right moment. Two months later, he came back to our house. He needed my dad to make a custom gold ring for his daughter's 10th birthday. My dad's a jeweler. While he was there, he called out for me, said his phone was dying and asked if I had a charger. I almost jumped from excitement. This was my chance. I told him I didn't have a wall charger, but I could charge it with a cable for my laptop. Handed it over without thinking twice. His phone had a passcode so I couldn't check his emails. But I pulled out the SD card. Stuck it in my laptop and copied every single file. Then I charged his phone and gave it back like nothing happened. He left and I locked myself in my room and went through everything. At first, I found nothing useful, just as I was about to give. But I found a hidden folder with a few videos. I opened one and there it was, a video with another woman. His face clear as day. I literally started singing to myself from excitement. For the next few weeks, I set up a perfect trap. Created a fake Facebook account that looked like his mistress, made a bunch of other fake accounts that look like her friends and family, had them all interact with her page to make it look real. Then I added his wife and messaged her saying I was her husband's mistress. She didn't believe me at first, so I gave her personal details about him that only someone close would know. Told her he'd lied and said they were divorced. Promise me marriage. She wanted to talk on the phone. I had a female friend help by lending her voice. His wife was destroyed. Then I sent her the video as proof. She filed for divorce immediately and sued him for infidelity, lost him custody and all visitation rights to his daughter. She took everything, the house, the money, every asset that was in her name. Overnight, he went from wealthy to homeless with literally zero dollars. But I wasn't done yet. I contacted his former business partner through one of the employees who especially hated my uncle, told him everything. The employees were ready to testify. He agreed to file a lawsuit. Then came the cherry on top. During the divorce proceedings, his ex wife testified that he threatened her and their daughter if she didn't put everything in her name. She pulled out phone recordings of him being aggressive, literally saying he'd make their lives miserable if she didn't help him dodge taxes. Judge heard those recordings and that was it, 15 years in prison. He got sentenced so fast he couldn't even process what was happening before he was on his way to jail. He lost everything, his family, his fortune, his freedom, all of it gone. Last month, I visited him in prison, walked up to his cell and said, just one sentence, this would have never happened if you just didn't call me a loser and left. The look on his face when he pieced it all together, when he realized I'd orchestrated every single thing that destroyed his life. That look almost cured my depression.

My grandfather wasn't just Westfield High's principal, he was its beating heart. He'd show up to Spirit Week in full costume, lose his voice at Pep rallies and turn senior pranks into legendary battles he somehow always won. The man literally orchestrated a midnight operation to relocate every senior desk onto the football field after they flipped his office upside down. But when we lost grandma last spring, we lost him too. He'd become the complete opposite. No more costumes, no more jokes, and definitely no more pranks. When my classmates started buzzing about senior prank ideas in March, he shut it down immediately over the morning announcements. There will be no senior prank this year. Any student caught attempting one will not walk at graduation. This is non negotiable. Everyone kept coming up to me in the hallways. Josh, you have to talk to him. Come on, you're his grandson. He'll listen to you. But I already tried. Every Sunday dinner at his empty house, I'd watch him push food around his plate in that too quiet kitchen where grandma used to hum while cooking. He'd just grunt when I mentioned school traditions. Rules are rules, Josh, even for you. My friends were relentless, though. During lunch, everyone kept begging me to come up with something. That's when I remembered this hilarious TikTok I'd seen where an entire senior class snuck into their principal's house. For a sleepover, just camping out in sleeping bags until he woke up. It was wholesome, harmless, and honestly, kind of sweet. I looked around the table, guys, what if we all broke into his house for a sleepover? The planning was intricate, but everyone was committed to pulling this off perfectly. I still had a spare key from when I used to stay over as a kid. And I knew my grandfather's routine by heart. He always took his hearing aid out at night and slept like a rock until his 6 a. M. Alarm. We wouldn't damage anything or steal anything. We'd just be 80 seniors with sleeping bags having the world's quietest slumber party in his living room and kitchen. I knew every creek in that house, every security light, even which windows he never locked. Midnight on April 30th, I LED the entire senior class through his backyard. We moved like ninjas, carrying sleeping bags and pillows, suppressing giggles as we filed through the back door. Everyone was so careful and respectful. We laid out our sleeping bags in perfect rows, took selfies, giving.

My boy Kamal sold cigarettes to half our grade. He didn't even try to keep it a secret. Literally everyone knew. But nobody, not even the teachers, could prove Shati. And that's exactly how he liked it. But last Tuesday, something happened that should have got him expelled. And the way he turned it around was genius. All started when we were posted by his locker between the third and fourth period, and the nerd of our class, Wesley, pulled up. He looked shocked. Not in a mean way. Like his eyes were all puffy and red and his hands were shaking a little. Everyone knew his girl had just dumped him for some senior on the basketball team. Wesley pulled out three 20 dollar bills and held them out to Kamal. Please, man, I need a pack of cigarettes. I got the money. Kamal looked at the cash and at Wesley's face and did something I'd never seen him do before. He shook his head. Nah, you're not thinking straight right now. Wesley's face went from desperate to heated in about half a second. You sell to everybody. Why not me? What, I'm not cool enough for you? The hallway got quiet. People were watching. Now, come on. Just shrugged. It's not about that. That's when Wesley lost his shit. His voice got so loud that teachers started poking their heads out of classrooms. You know what? Fine. But I'm telling the Teachers, everything. He lowered his voice before. Continue. Anyway. Where you keep the cigarettes, who you sell to? All of it. Then he stormed off. My stomach dropped. I grabbed Kamal's arm. Bro, he's definitely planning to snitch on you. You need to get rid of the cigarettes, like, now. Kamal watched Wesley disappear around the corner, and dead ass just shrugged his shoulders and said, yeah, probably. Like we were talking about the weather. He didn't even care that he was about to get caught. That night, I couldn't sleep thinking about how Kamal was about to lose everything. His entire livelihood was about to be shut down, and he wasn't even sweating it. The next morning, I was sitting beside him in first period when the intercom crackled to life. Principal Griffin's voice boomed through the whole school. Kimball O'kavor. Come to my office now.

He said, you made your choice when you let him examine you and now you have to live with the consequences. I told him the consequence was cancer and I needed treatment from a specialist. Yeah, and whose fault is that? He said, if you had found a female doctor from the start, maybe this wouldn't have happened. I stared at him in complete shock. You think I got cancer because a male doctor examined me? I asked. He shrugged. I'm just saying that actions have consequences. Maybe if you had asked my permission first, we could have prevented this. I felt something inside me break completely. I literally have cancer, I said. He rolled his eyes. And I have a girlfriend who cheated on me, he said. We both have problems and they are both your fault. I walked to the bedroom and grabbed my phone and keys. Where do you think you're going? Charles yelled after me. I came back to the Doorway, I'm leaving. We're done, I said. He laughed. You're not going anywhere, he said. We're going to sit down and talk until you admit what you did was wrong. I looked at him standing there like he had any authority over me. If you actually think a medical exam for cancer is cheating, then you're going to die alone. He tried to follow me, but I held up my hand. Don't come any closer, I said. I got in my car and backed out while he stood on the porch yelling about how I was being dramatic. He texted me that night saying he'd be willing to take me back if I promised to only see female doctors for my cancer treatment. I blocked his number and confirmed my appointment for the following week.

I laughed because I thought he was messing with me, but his face stayed completely serious. Charles, it's just my annual exam, I said. Every woman has to get checked once a year. He threw the card back on the counter and asked if the doctor was male. I told him yes, and he let out this bitter laugh. So you've been letting another man put his hands in you, he said. I felt my chest tightened because I realized he wasn't joking. I explained that it was a medical professional checking for cancer and health issues. Don't play dumb with me, he said. You knew exactly what you were doing and you hid it from me. I reminded him that I told him about the appointment last week, and he cut me off. You said you had a doctor's appointment, he said. You didn't mention another man would be examining you down there. He stepped closer and pointed at me. We both know what really happened in that exam room, and it makes me sick. Charles started pacing. Call them right now and cancel every appointment you have with that pervert, he said. I'm not doing that, I said. I have a follow up in two weeks. He got in my face. Why can't you miss it? He demanded. I explained they found abnormal Cells on my cervix, and I needed treatment. Oh, how convenient, he said. Now suddenly you have a medical emergency to justify letting him touch you. He started scrolling on his phone. There are three female gynecologists within 20 miles. He said, you're switching to one today, or we're done. I told him, you can't just switch doctors in the middle of treatment. I don't give a damn! Charles yelled, what kind of girlfriend spreads her legs for another man? Do you have any idea how disrespected I feel? I sat down at the kitchen table. It's an important medical exam to check for cervical cancer. I said, millions of women get this done every year, or they die. He slammed his hand on the counter. You let another man stick his finger there's inside you, and you didn't even think about how that would make me feel? I pointed out he never mentioned having a problem with doctors before. I shouldn't have to tell you that my girlfriend's body belongs to me, he said. I stood up. If the situation was reversed, I tell you to go to whatever doctor you needed, I said. His face went red. That's different, and you know it. He said, you're making excuses because you know what you did was disgusting. I took a deep breath and got ready to tell him the truth. Charles, those

Found one last week. Four bedrooms, Lake View. Closing next month. Richard's face went white. The middle management job. I manage 43 people. My salary is 280,000 a year, plus stock options. Claire's mother gasped. I kept it quiet because Claire asked me to. Said her family was judgmental. Said they treat me different if they knew about money. I looked at my wife. Guess you were right. You've been lying to us. Richard sputtered. No. You never asked. You was soon. I pulled out a folder from my coat, set it on the table. What's that? Claire asked. Divorce papers filed this morning. Her face went white. I knew about tonight. Your sister warned me last week. Claire's sister went pale. You knew? Claire whispered. Your family's been planning this for a month. Group chat screenshots are in the folder. I looked at Derek. She knew, too. They've been texting for six weeks. That's not true, Claire started. I pulled out my phone again, showed the call logs from our phone plan. 217 calls, 17 texts. I'm a tech manager. I know how to check records. Derek stood up. This is just a misunderstanding. Is it because Claire's been telling you she's settled? That she wishes she could go back and choose differently? I had the screenshots. I didn't show them. Claire's face told the whole story. How dare you spy on your own wife! Richard shouted. How dare you auction off your Daughter like livestock. Richard grabbed his chest, started breathing hard. Dad! Claire reached for him. Someone call 9 1 1? Claire's mother said. I picked up my folder, started walking. Wait. Claire called. Marcus, please. This isn't what it looks like. I stopped at the door. It's exactly what it looks like. You wanted a real man with real money. I looked at the whole table. At Richard gasping, at Derek, frozen. At Claire crying. At 20 family members who just clapped for my replacement. Turns out you had one all along. You just didn't know it because you never bothered to ask. I looked at Derek. He's all yours now. Hope partner salary is enough. We can fix this, Claire said, crying now. I made a mistake. I'll tell them. No, I'll. The papers are filed. My lawyer will contact you Monday. You can't just leave me. I'm not leaving you. I open the door. Full story on the channel linked below.

Now it's time for a real man to step in. He gestured to her ex boyfriend. The family clapped. I stood up, grabbed my coat and said three words that made him collapse. The restaurant went quiet. When Richard stood up, 20 family members turned to watch. Marcus, he said, gripping my hand too hard. You've been a decent placeholder, a safe choice, but Claire deserves better. My wife stared at her plate. She wouldn't look at me. I'd like to introduce everyone to Derek. To gesture to the man beside him, Claire's first love, the one that got away.

Everyone except me and Claire. What is this? I asked quietly. Richard sat down. It's an intervention. You're a nice guy, Marcus, but nice doesn't pay for private schools. Nice doesn't buy lake houses. We've been married seven years. I and you've been struggling for 7 years. Still renting, still driving that 12 year old Honda, still working that middle management job. Derek leaned forward. No offense, man, but Claire and I have History. Real chemistry. Then why did you break up? I asked. I was young and stupid. I'm not anymore. Claire finally looked up. Her eyes were red. Say something, I told her. My parents think, she started. I don't care what they think. What do you want? She glanced at her father, at Derek, at the whole table watching. I want what's best for our family, she whispered. I stood up. Grab my coat. Where are you going? Richard demanded. Away from people who think love has a price tag. Sit down. We're not done. Yeah, I said, we are. I looked at Claire. You coming? She looked at Derek, at her father, at her whole family tree of expectations. I need time to think, she said. Take all the time you want. I pulled out my phone, opened my banking app, turned the screen toward Richard. What's this? He asked. My portfolio, the one Claire knows about. His eyes scan. The numbers went wide. That's, that's over $2 million. The table went silent. Cryptocurrency. Early investments. I bought bitcoin when it was $8. Ethereum at 12. Derek Smirk vanished. The Honda paid cash. Could have bought a Tesla. Didn't need to prove anything. I scrolled down the rental month to month because.

It was supposed to be the happiest day of my life. The venue was absolutely perfect, the flowers were stunning, and everyone I loved was there celebrating with me and my new husband. My dad had married Karen when I was just eight years old, and despite our incredibly complicated and often rocky relationship over the past 12 years, I made the difficult decision to invite her to give a speech at my reception. She been drinking champagne heavily since the ceremony ended three hours earlier, getting progressively bolder and more bitter with each glass she consumed. I watched her nervously from across the crowded room, laughing way too loudly at her own inappropriate jokes and making increasingly snide comments to anyone unfortunate enough to be standing within earshot. When she suddenly grabbed the microphone from our DJ stations, tumbling slightly as she did, I should have immediately known that something absolutely terrible was about to happen. I want to thank each and every one of you for coming out tonight to celebrate this absolutely gorgeous, beautiful day, she started, her voice dripping with the kind of fake, saccharine sweetness that made my skin crawl. The entire reception hall gradually quieted down as our 300 guests slowly turned their attention toward her swaying figure. Though I have to honestly admit, it's really quite a Bit awkward being specifically asked to give a heartfelt speech about someone who isn't actually, technically really my daughter. The words hit me like a devastating physical blow to the chest. The entire reception hall went completely, utterly dead silent. I could literally feel 300 pairs of shock eyes suddenly turning to stare directly at me. My brand new husband immediately squeezed my hand so tightly it almost hurt. His handsome face completely twisted in a mixture of shock, disbelief, and pure rage. My maid of honour started to quickly rise from her seat, clearly ready to march over and intervene on my behalf. I mean, please don't get me wrong here, Karen continued with obvious relish, clearly enjoying every single second of the attention and the visible discomfort she was causing throughout the room. I genuinely tried my absolute best for 12 very long, very difficult years. But we all know perfectly well that blood is always thicker than water, right? Some family bonds you simply just can't fake, no matter how incredibly hard you try to pretend otherwise. My father looked completely and utterly mortified from his seat at the head table, his face pale as a ghost. Wedding guests were shifting extremely uncomfortably in their elegant chairs, some whispering frantically to each other, others staring down intensely at their untouched dinner plates. My elderly grandmother was shaking her head back and forth in pure disgust. Even our professional photographer had stopped taking pictures entirely, clearly sensing the Terrible tension. I felt hot tears starting to form behind my eyes. But then something completely different took over my entire body. Strange, calm, cold determination that honestly surprised even me. I stood up very slowly and deliberately, carefully smooth down my expensive wedding dress and walked with perfect composure across the polished dance floor to where Karen stood swaying slightly with a microphone clutched in her manicure.

My sister Katie and I are twins and we both ended up pregnant at the same time. She got pregnant about 3 weeks before me and immediately decided this meant our pregnancies had to be like some weird twin bonding experience. First thing she did was try to get me to do matching baby names. She wanted us to name our babies Edmond and Edward if they were boys or Ethel and Mabel if they were girls. She kept going on about how cute it would be for twin moms to have matching baby names and how it was meant to be. Here's the problem. Those names are absolutely terrible. Edmond and Ethel sound like they belong to people who died in 1890. I told Katie that me and my husband Jake, were going to pick our own name without worrying about what she chose. She did not take that well. She got all pouty and said I was ruining what could be a special twin moment. Then she switched tactics and started asking me constantly what names we were considering. At first, it was just when we hung out. Then it became text every single day. The same text would come through at like two PM have you guys decided on a name yet? If I, I didn't answer, she text again later or call or message me on Instagram asking the same thing. This went on for weeks. I told her multiple times to stop asking because we weren't sharing the name yet. She promised to stop and then the next day the text would start again. I start started just ignoring her when she asked. But that somehow made it worse. My husband and I had already picked out the perfect name months ago. We loved it and didn't want anyone's opinion on it. But we especially didn't want Katie to know because I had this gut feeling she would try to either use it herself or pick something that matched with it. See, Katie has always been a little competitive with me, not in a mean way, but in this weird twin way where she needs us to do everything together. Or similarly, when I got engaged, she got engaged four months later. When I bought a house, she started looking at houses in the same neighborhood. Last week, I finally hit my breaking point when she texted me seven times in one day asking about baby names. That's when Jake suggested we just give her a fake name. At first, I thought it was too mean, but then I thought about it more. Katie thinks any unique name is weird. I once told her years ago that I liked the name Meadow and she acted like I said I wanted to name my kid helicopter. So I figured if I gave her something.

He saw me and his whole face lit up. Walked straight over with his huge smile. Evan, just the young man I wanted to see. He shook my hand, firm grip. Congratulations, son. You're doing the right thing. Katie's mother and I were really proud of you. I stood there holding a Alan of milk, completely confused. Uh, thank you. Your parents must be thrilled, too. My mom appeared behind me with the shopping cart. Thrilled about what? Mr Barry's smile faltered. Oh, you haven't told them yet? Told them what? He shifted uncomfortably. I think I should let Katie explain. But really, congratulations. You're being very mature about this. He walked away fast. My mom looked at me. What was that about? I have no idea. I pulled out my phone and called Katie straight to voicemail. Texted, what is your dad talking about? No response. Evan, what's going on, mom? I seriously don't know. That night my phone rang. Katie's mom, hi, Missus Barry, Evan, honey, I just wanted to say how mature you're being about all this. My head was spinning. About what long pause? Katie hasn't talked. To you yet. Talk to me about what I think you two need to have a conversation. I'll have her call you. She hung up. I tried Katie again. Voicemail. I texted, your mom just called. What is going on? No response.

I swear, I don't know. Is Katie okay? I don't know. She won't answer her phone. That night, Doug showed up at my door. Bro, my mom just told me about you and Katie. That's crazy. You good? I pulled him inside. What did your mom tell you? Just that you guys are dealing with some serious stuff. She wouldn't give details, but he looked uncomfortable. You sure this is what you want, Doug? I have no idea what anyone is talking about. His eyes widened. Wait, you seriously don't know? No, dude, you need to find Katie. This sounds big. The next morning, I went to Katie's house before school, knocked on the door. Katie's mom answered. Her eyes were red. Evan, she doesn't want to see you right now. Why not? What's happening? She's going through a lot. Give her some Space, Missus, Barry, please. Nobody will tell me what's going on. She looked at me for a long moment. You really don't know? No.

There was this girl, Juliana, who transferred to our school right after winter break. Within exactly two weeks, she had somehow stolen three different boyfriends from the most popular girls in school. At least that's the story that spread like wildfire. My best friend literally grabbed my arm in the hallway after the third breakup and was like, I'm serious. Stay away from that girl. She completely destroyed Lily's two year relationship. And now Tomas won't even look at Lily anymore. The teacher seems genuinely uncomfortable around Juliana, too. It was so obvious when whenever students try to sit near her in class, they'd suddenly announce new seating arrangements or find reasons to move people around. She ate lunch completely alone every single day, sitting at this corner table while literally the entire cafeteria buzzed with whispers. Boys wouldn't even make eye contact with her when she walked by, and I swear some girls would actually hiss under their breath. It was like watching someone navigate a minefield. But something felt really off about the whole thing, and I was curious. I tried sitting near her once in chemistry before our teacher suddenly decided we needed better lab partnerships and moved me. But honestly, she just seems completely normal. Maybe even nicer than most people. I started paying attention to Juliana over the next few weeks, and watching her life at school become absolute hell was honestly traumatizing. Girls organized Full boycotts against any group project that included her name. Someone carved homewrecker into her locker. But the thing that made me physically sick, someone put laxatives in her lunch, and she got violently ill in the main hallway while people literally laughed and pulled out their phones to record her humiliation. But here's what really screwed with my head. Juliana never once fought back or defended herself. She tutored struggling freshman for free during study hall. She volunteered at the animal shelter every weekend. I know because my cousin works there. When people spread the most vicious lies about her, she just absorbed it all. For someone supposedly manipulative enough to destroy relationships, she was weirdly generous and selfless. It didn't add up at all. Then came the party that changed everything. It was Rebecca's house party. Her parents were out of town, and basically the entire junior class was there. I was in the upstairs bathroom when I heard this commotion in the hallway. Dylan had cornered the sophomore girl, Jen, against the wall. She looked terrified and kept saying, please stop, while he kept pushing closer, clearly drunk and getting aggressive. Everyone else just walked by like nothing was happening. Some people were even filming and laughing like it was entertainment. This girl was obviously in distress, and nobody cared. That's when Juliana appeared out of nowhere and shoved herself between them. When he started getting hostile and threatened to ruin both their nights, Juliana pulled out. Her phone and started recording. Go ahead. Keep talking. I'm sure your scholarship committee would love to see the side of their star athlete. Dylan actually backed down. Juliana made sure Jen got safely to her friends and then disappeared back into the crowd like nothing happened. But I saw the whole thing, and it was the most fear thing I'd ever witnessed. You think witnessing her protect someone would change how people saw her, right? Think again. By Monday morning, the story had completely flipped. Dylan was telling everyone that Juliana had been stalking him all night and trying to start drama. People said she was desperate for attention and probably staged the whole thing with Jen. The worst part? Jen, who Juliana had literally saved, went along with it. She claimed nothing serious was happening and that Juliana misunderstood the situation. The peer pressure was so intense that Jen threw her own protector under the bus just to avoid becoming a target herself. Juliana got suspended pending a full investigation. But the absolute breaking point came when someone hacked into Juliana's social media accounts and leaked her private messages with her therapist from a mental health app. Screenshots of her discussing trauma, family issues, and self harm thoughts spread through every group chat and social media platform. People were sharing her most vulnerable moments, like memes. Kids started leaving printouts of her therapy messages taped to her locker. Parents received anonymous emails with her private mental health information. Warning them that Julianna was dangerous and unstable. The worst part? Everyone felt justified. They genuinely believed they were protecting the school from her. I tried texting Julianna, but my messages wouldn't deliver. Then I heard she was in the hospital. I found her in the psychiatric facility, looking so small and broken. That's when she showed me the restraining order Dylan put out against her, meaning she could no longer come back to school. She broke down and admitted that she had never dated anyone since she got to the school. She just befriended a few of the guys and gave them relationship advice. They decided they didn't want to be with their girlfriends anymore. But instead of telling them why, they just said they fell for Jen, then staged a breakup. And Jen went along with it because they asked. She didn't realise it would lead to her destruction. She told me not to worry, though. She was going to destroy some things herself very soon. Trust me, what happened next will make your jaw drop. Click the link.

My wife and I have been married for about 10 years. Our relationship has gotten a little boring over the years. We really struggled to find that spark. One day I came home from work early to find her cheating on me with our next door neighbour. I caught them doing the deed through the door being slightly cracked. I was going to bust them, but I realised that I enjoy watching. I casually walked in and told them to carry on. I pulled up a chair and watched the whole thing. Unfortunately, the guy couldn't keep his thing up. I guess he was a little nervous, but I was pretty turned up, so I took over. After this day, I told my wife that I really liked watching and that she should continue with other men. We created a routine. She would go to the bars on the weekend and score any men she wants. Afterwards she will bring them home. About 10 minutes into the action, I would sneak into the room and watch. It was a live movie. I don't always watch. Sometimes I join the fun or do anything I feel like. I don't have any intention on making my wife watch me, but we will definitely give it a try down the line.

But at my best friend's engagement party, when asked about our wedding date in front of everyone, he awkwardly fell silent. The awkward moment passed quickly and the party roared back to life. I laughed and joked along with everyone else, genuinely happy for the two people at the centre of it all, best friend Sophie and her fiance. The teasing had started because halfway through the night, Sophie's boyfriend had dropped to one knee and proposed. With her ecstatic. Yes, Kobe and I became the last unmarried couple in our circle. During a round of party games, Sophie slipped into the seat next to me and quietly squeezed my hand, gave her a reassuring smile. Of all our friends, Kobe and I had been the first to get together. Everyone assumed we'd be the first to walk down the aisle. But that was six years ago and we were still just boyfriend and girlfriend. By the end of the night, only Kobe, Sophie, her new fiance, Alex and I remained. Sophie pulled me into a tight hug, whispering in my ear, Jennifer, whatever you do, don't settle for less than you deserve. I hugged her back, my voice like I won't. After we waved them off, I turned to get into Kobe's car. He was staring at his phone, not even looking up. Lola's working late at the office. Her phone Died so she can't get a ride. I'm going to pick her up, okay, I said. My hand already in my purse. The moment he'd said Lola, my fingers had instinctively opened the ride share app as if on cue. A car was confirmed. Just as he finished his sentence, he, he finally looked up at me. You had a bit to drink tonight? Get home safe and rest up. I'm leaving now. Mem, Mem was all I said. As his car pulled away from the curb, I took a few quick steps back to avoid breathing in his exhaust fumes. A moment later, my phone buzzed with a voice message from him. Normally, I would have fumbled for my earbuds, eager to hear his voice. Night, I couldn't be bothered. I just let the app transcribe it. I'll head back right after I drop her off. Don't overthink it. That was new. He'd never bothered with reassurances before. When he ditched me for Lola, I typed back a single reply. Okay. The chat bubble showed he was typing, then it disappeared. He said nothing. I didn't really care. Ever since I made my decision, a strange sense of peace had settled over me. For the thought of Lola, Kobe's childhood friend, had me tied in knots of anxiety and insecurity. He had turned me into someone I didn't recognize. I'd lost count of the number of hysterical fights we'd had about her. And every time he just watched me With those cold, detached eyes, when are you going to stop? I see Lola as a sister. Her parents trusted me to look after her. That's all. I gave her a job at the company because she's qualified. Stop being so paranoid if that's what you want to believe. There's nothing I can do. The same lines over and over. I could recite them by heart. I went home but didn't wait up for Kobe. I just went to sleep. As expected, he never came home. I knew he wouldn't. Message pinged on my phone in the morning. Lola's power went out last night. I stayed to help her fix it. Got late, didn't want to wake you. Another ping. I got a room at a hotel, didn't stay at her place. He was always so brazenly honest about it, never hiding anything about Lola.

But she forgot the prenup her parents forced me to sign before marriage. When Sarah won the lottery, she became a different person overnight. We've been married for eight years. The morning after the numbers came in, she was on the phone with lawyers. By noon, I had divorce papers. Evening, my clothes were in garbage bags on the lawn. Pack your shit and get out, she said, standing in the doorway. I'm done playing house with someone who never amounted to anything. I'm a high school teacher making $52,000 a year. She worked part time at a bookstore, maybe $18,000. For eight years. I paid the mortgage, covered the bills, funded her pottery hobby. None of that mattered. Now she had $9 million and I was suddenly worthless. Sarah, can we just talk about this? There's nothing to talk about. My lawyer says I'll keep everything, the house, the cars, the money. You'll get whatever the court feels generous enough to give you, which won't be much. She smiled this cold, unfamiliar smile. I'm going to travel, buy a condo in Miami, live the life I always deserved. You, you can go back to your sad little classroom. I grabbed my bags and left. My buddy Mike let me crash on his couch. The next morning, Sarah's Instagram was updated. New chapter, new life, no dead weight. Her friends commented, you deserve this, queen. Finally ditching that loser. I Spent 3 days in a fog. Then I remembered the prenup. When we got engaged, Sarah's parents insisted on a prenuptial agreement. They thought I was marrying her for money, which was insane because they were solidly middle class. But they were paranoid. I didn't want to sign it. It felt insulting. But Sarah begged, please just do this for me. It doesn't mean anything. So I signed the prenup, stated that any assets acquired during the marriage through windfalls, including lottery winnings, inheritances or gifts would be split 50, 50, regardless of whose name they were in. Her parents wanted to protect their potential inheritance to her, but the lawyer they'd hired was fresh out of law school and worded it badly, real badly. I dug through my boxes until I found my copy, then took it straight to a lawyer. He read it twice, then started laughing. Your wife just won the lottery $9 million during your marriage. Yes. He laughed harder. She owes you half. This prenup is iron clad. She can't touch that money without splitting it with you. I filed a counter petition the next day including the prenup as evidence. Sarah's lawyer called me within hours. Voice tight. You need to withdraw this immediately. You're making a huge mistake. No mistake. Just enforcing the prenup. Her parents made me sign. That prenup was meant to protect her. Then they should have hired a better lawyer. Silence. Then she'll fight this. Good. See you in court. The hearing was three weeks later. Sarah showed up in designer clothes, a new Rolex, glinting when she saw me, her face twisted with rage. Her lawyer argued the prenup was signed under duress, that it couldn't apply to lottery winnings. My lawyer presented the document and highlighted the relevant section. The judge read it carefully.

If you don't like that, don't marry me. Everyone stared at me. I just said okay. By the next week, invitations were cancelled and she realized the marriage was too. It all ended at a Sunday dinner, one of those polite, suffocating pre wedding gatherings where two families pretend they actually like each other. My parents sat on one side, quiet, traditional, married 40 years. Across from them, Clara's parents, retired therapists who believed every boundary was a conversation. And beside them sat Leo, her ex, Clara. He wasn't an ex, he was family. He had a key to her parents house. He was at every holiday, every birthday, every dinner. The ghost of her past haunting my future. I tolerated it for years, following my pride while they lectured me about toxic masculinity and possessive tendencies. I wasn't jealous. I just believed the past should stay buried. But I was done wondering. Tonight I wanted to see how far she'd go. Over dessert, my mother, dignified, soft spoken, asked the question I've been avoiding. Clara, dear, I noticed Leo's name at the family table on the seating chart. Are you sure that's appropriate? The room went still. Clara's mother froze mid bite. Her father gave a disapproving little sigh. And Clara, she smiled that brittle practiced smile she used before throwing grenades. My mother's just concerned about appearances, I said, trying to keep it Calm. Having your ex at the family table might confuse people. That did it confuse people, she snapped. Leo is family. He's been in my life longer than you. He'll always be in my life. Her father chimed in. Ben, we've talked about this. You're threatened by Clara's evolved relationships. The words evolved relationships hung in the air like a bad smell. My parents sat frozen, faces tight with shock. And then Clara stood, chin high, hands on hips. Let me make this perfectly clear, she said, her voice cutting through the room. My ex will always be part of my life. He'll be at our wedding, our holidays, our kids baptisms. If you don't like that, don't marry me. Silence. Everyone stared at me. She expected an argument, a gravel, a compromise. Instead, I just nodded once. Okay. Confusion flickered in her eyes. Okay, you'll stop overreacting. I stood, folded my napkin. No, okay. I won't marry you. Her smirk vanished. I turned to my parents. Let's go. And just like that, we walked out, leaving her standing in the ruins of her own ultimatum. The drive home was silent. 10 minutes in, my dad said quietly, you sure about this, son? Never been sure. My mom turned around, eyes dry, proud. Good, he said. She wasn't the one. That night, my phone blew up. Dozens of calls, texts, accusations. Clara, you can't be serious, her mom. You need to apologize, Leo, you're blowing this way out of proportion. Man, they all thought okay meant we'll talk later. They hadn't realized it meant the end. I made one call to our wedding planner, cancel everything. I said, the wedding's off.

My boss turned me on and I decided to act on it. So I was working late one day to finish up a presentation, and my boss was also there working late. As he was coming out of his office to talk to me, he was just wearing a plain white T-shirt. Normally he would just be wearing a suit, but I guess he took it off because only I was in the office when he was in a shirt. His arms were so big and filled with tattoos. I didn't think he would have this many ink because he is always reserved. He told me that he was getting some Chinese food and asked if I would like to get in the order. Of course I did, because I'm not the one to turn down free food. The food arrived. We were just munching on it together and talking about work. As we were eating, I was checking his body out. Big arms, big chest and sharp jawline. I thought to myself, I could really climb this man out. Nowhere, I just blurted, can we fudge? He was shocked and was like, what? I said sorry. Since I already blurted it out unexpectedly, I decided to just go with it. So I repeated myself to my shocking. He actually said yes. When he said yes, it triggered something in me. I jumped across the desk and began making Out with him. I am a pretty tiny individual, so he was able to handle me pretty well. He took his shaft and, my god, this thing was at least nine inches.

I had this bathroom pass system where students got three passes per semester, and if you ran out, you were stuck holding it during class. It worked perfectly at first, but then second semester, this kid Derek started asking to use the bathroom every single day. I reminded him he was out of passes completely since mid January, and he said he knew, said be just hold it. But the next day, he asked again, and I said no. And he just sat back down with no complaints. Just went right back to his work like nothing happened. This pattern continued for six straight weeks, where every single day, Derek would raise his hand and ask for the bathroom. I'd say no and reference the pass policy, and he just accept it and go back to work without arguing or making any kind of scene. I started thinking he was just testing my boundaries, trying to wear me down until I'd eventually cave and let him go. But he stayed complete, completely polite the entire time. Then one Tuesday, the principal called me into her office with this weird expression on her face, half amused and half genuinely concerned. And she asked if I knew that Eric had been leaving my classroom every single day for the past two months. I actually laughed out loud and told her that was impossible because I never gave him a bathroom pass. Not Even once she turned her monitor toward me and pulled up security footage from outside my classroom door. Started playing it back from February and the footage showed Derek walking out of my room with the time stamp reading one forty seven PM. Right in the middle of my fifth period class. She fast forwarded to the next day and same thing, Derek walking out at the same exact time. And she kept going through day after day, where every single day showed the same pattern of Derek leaving during fifth period, always around the same time. I sat there completely confused cause there was no way I wouldn't have noticed a student just walking out in the middle of my lesson. I would have seen him get up and walk to the door and stopped him before he even reached it. The principal could see my confusion, so she rewind the footage and played it in real time to let me watch. Second by second. The camera showed Derek sitting at his desk in the back corner and he raised his hand high and I watched myself walk over to him and shake.

The day came and went. Keith's family didn't show up, didn't call, didn't text, nothing. The next weekend was Jacob's 6th birthday. Another invitation, another party. I showed up with just my kids. Again, no gift. This time Keith confronted me right in his driveway before we even got inside. Seriously again, he said, when's the last time you brought my kids anything, I asked. He just stood there, couldn't name a single time. His wife came out and said, we're always so busy with work and their sports schedules. I work full time, too. I said, I still managed to get your kids gifts for six years. They didn't have an answer for that. We stayed for exactly one hour, then left. My mom stopped talking to me for two weeks. He finally called and said I needed to apologize to Keith for making his kids birthdays uncomfortable. Tell Keith to apologize for the last 8 birthdays he missed. I said she hung up on me. Three months passed. My daughter's 8th birthday came around. I didn't even bother inviting Keith's family this time had the party at a trampoline park with her school friends instead. She didn't even ask about her cousins. Last month, Noah turned 9. The invitation came. I threw it in the recycling bin without opening it. Keith called me the day before the party asking if we were coming. Nope. I said, come on, the kids miss their cousins. Tried. Funny how they only miss them when it's convenient for you, I said, and ended the call. My mom showed up at my house the next day with a wrapped present. You're being ridiculous, she said. Just bring this to Noah and fix things with your brother. I handed it back to her. You bring it. I'm done doing all the work in this family. She left it on my porch anyway. It sat there in the rain for 2 days before I finally brought it inside and donated it to the toy drive at work.

For six years straight, I showed up to every single one of my nephew's birthday parties with wrapped presents. Noah turned seven, I brought him that expensive robot kit he wanted. Jacob turned five, I got him the Dinosaur set from the fancy toy store. Every year, twice a year, I'd spend at least 40 bucks per kid and drive 30 minutes to their house. My kids are eight and 6 now, and in all those years, not once did my brother Keith or his wife bring anything to my kids parties. Not a card, not a five dollar toy from the discount store, nothing. They'd show up, eat the cake, let their kids play, then leave. Last year was the worst.

Two months later, Noah's eighth birthday invitation arrived in the mail. One of those fancy printed ones with the superhero theme. My husband saw me looking at it and said, you're not actually going to buy another present, right? I thought about it for three days. I looked at my Amazon order history and counted 12 birthday gifts I'd Bought for my nephews over the years. Then I checked my kids birthday photos. Keith's family wasn't in a single one from the last three years. I decided we'd still go to the party, but I walked in empty handed. My mom was already there and immediately pulled me aside. Where's Noah's gift? She whispered. I didn't bring one. Her face went red. What do you mean you didn't bring one? Everyone brings gifts to birthday parties. Keith never brings gifts to my kids parties, I said. She started talking about how that's different, how I'm being petty, how it's not the kids fault. But I just walked away and sat down at one of the tables. Keith's wife noticed right away. She kept staring at me during the cake cutting. Probably looking for a gift bag that wasn't there.

The meeting day arrived. Our whole family packed into Mister Voss's conference room. Marcus brought his contractor, kept checking his watch. Can we speed this up? I'm losing my deposit on the moving truck if this runs long. Mr Voss opened his folder calmly. Before we finalize, I need to ask Marcus, do you owe any outstanding debts to your grandfather's estate? Marcus looked confused. What? No. Why would I? Mr Voss slid the promissory note across the table. This is a loan agreement from six years ago, $45,000 for business startup costs. The terms required repayment before any inheritance could be distributed. Can you confirm you've repaid this? The color drained from Marcus's face. That wasn't a real loan. That was dad helping me out. Family helping family. His wife grabbed the paper reading it, her face going white. Marcus, what is this? The trust terms are explicit. Mister Voss continued, outstanding debts disqualify inheritance eligibility. The house goes to the other grandchild. Marcus stood. Grandpa never actually expected me to pay that back. It was just paperwork. I pulled out my phone, open the screenshots I'd saved. These are text messages from Grandpa's last month. He asked you about making even small payments on the loan. You kept saying, soon. Dad, business is tight. Marcus's wife was crying. Now we gave notice on our rental. Where are we supposed to go? Mr Voss looked at Marcus. You gave notice on a property you didn't inherit yet. The room went completely silent. My mom was staring at Marcus like she'd never seen him before. Marcus turned to me, desperate look. Can you loan me money for a new rental deposit just to get us through this? I stood up, grabbed my coat. Come on, Marcus, you have three mouths to feed. Even Grandpa's ghost knows you need this more than I do. His face crumpled. My mom looked like she wanted to say something but couldn't find words. I walked out with Mister Voss to sign the final paperwork. Through the conference room window, I could see Marcus sitting there, his contractor awkwardly gathering his things, his wife on the phone probably calling their landlord, his entire life plan collapsing. He'd been too busy planning renovations to remember the debt that disqualified him. I've been too busy taking care of grandpa in his final months to forget anything.

I said yes, knowing he'd never inherit it. Grandpa died three months ago. His will said the house would go to the grandchild who needs it most, with our family lawyer, Mister Voss as executor making the final call after reviewing our finances. I'm 28, a financial analyst and child free. My older brother Marcus is 34 with three kids. He decided immediately this meant the house was his. Within two weeks, Marcus was bringing contractors to Grandpa's empty house for renovation quotes. He took his kids to pick out paint colors for their new bedrooms. He sent me Zillow links to studio condos with messages like, you'll be fine in something smaller, right? I didn't respond. Marcus didn't know was that I've been meeting with Mr Voss regularly not to provide my bank statements, proving I didn't need the house to provide Marcus's records. While going through Grandpa's papers to help settle the estate, I found something interesting. Promissory note from six years ago. Grandpa had loaned Marcus $45,000 for a business startup. Signed contract, 0% interest term saying pay when you can. Marcus never paid back a single cent, never even acknowledged the loan existed. He told everyone his business was self funded. The trust had a debt provision. I remembered from when Grandpa explained his estate planning years ago. Any grandchild who owed money to the estate had to repay it before being eligible to Inherit Marcus had disqualified himself six years ago and didn't even know it. Last Sunday at family dinner, Marcus made his big announcement. So we gave notice on our rental yesterday. We're moving into Grandpa's place in six weeks. His wife smiled. His kids cheered. My mom started crying happy tears. I kept eating my pasta. Marcus, Mister Voss hasn't made his decision yet, I said quietly. Marcus laughed. That condescending older brother laughed. Come on, you make bank and you're alone. I have three mouths to feed. Even Grandpa's ghost knows I need this more. Everyone nodded. My aunt asked Marcus about his renovation timeline. My uncle offered to help him move furniture. Marcus looked at me across the table. Actually, little brother, I could use your help moving. You're still pretty strong, right? Family supports family. I smiled. Sure. When's the move? Six weeks from Saturday. I'll keep my schedule open, I said. What I didn't say was.

Just a paper map adventure. I got lost for three hours. It was the best date I ever had. Day 60, Emma started cracking. She called me at midnight. How are you doing this? I am going insane and I still have my phone. I told her the truth. I stopped missing it after week three. Day 65, the family had a barbecue. Everyone was on their phones. I was the only one actually present. My nephew asked me to play catch. We threw the ball for an hour. Day 70, my aunt Sharon admitted she checked her phone 247 times that day. The average was 96. Don't. She looked exhausted. Day 75, Sophie told me she deleted Instagram. Said I inspired her. We started a book club with my neighbors. Eight people showed up. Day 80, Emma called the lawyer. Her voice was shaking. I cannot do this anymore. Watching him made me realize how addicted I am. I forfeit. Day 85, Brad dropped out, too. Said his wife threatened divorce because he Was on his phone during family dinner every night. Day 89, just me left. The lawyer called. You won. Come get your keys tomorrow. At night, I could not sleep. I kept thinking about Uncle Michael. About what he really wanted. Day 90, I walked into the lawyer's office. The whole family was there. Emma looked defeated. Brad looked ashamed. I told the lawyer I did not want the house. Sell it. Split the money between everyone equally. My aunt gasped. Emma started crying. Why would you do that? Because Uncle Michael was not testing who could live without a phone. He was testing who was willing to change. And I already got what I needed. Emma handed me her Audi keys. Anyway, you earned this. I sold the car. Paid off my student loans. Took Sophie to that restaurant where I had the panic attack on day eight. We laughed about it. Ordered without looking anything up. She moved in with me. Six months later, we still do not have smartphones. Best cold bet I ever accepted. Uncle Michael knew exactly what he was doing.

My aunt Sharon said, this is ridiculous. How are we supposed to function? How? But I looked at my phone. The screen time report said 11 hours a day. I was the worst one there. I will do it.

I had to sit on them to stop checking. Day five, I woke up in a cold sweat because I dreamed I accidentally opened Twitter. Day eight, I had a full panic attack at a restaurant because I could not not look up the menu online. The waiter had to talk me through the options like I was a child. Day 10, Emma started her campaign. She texted the family group chat, he is definitely cheating. Check his laptop. No way he is lasting. The lawyer confirmed I had not touched any device. My mom vouched for me that I was using a flip phone only for emergencies. Day 15 was the hardest. My best friend got engaged and everyone was celebrating in the group chat. I found out three days later when someone called me on my dumb phone. I almost quit right there. Day 20, something shifted. I started actually talking to my neighbours. Mister Patterson told me about his time in Vietnam. I had lived next to him for six years and never knew. Day 25, I went to a coffee shop and met a girl named Sophie. We talked for two hours. No phones, just conversation. She did not believe me when I said I had not touched my phone in weeks. Day 30, I invited Sophie to dinner. We played board games. She said, this feels like the nineties. I did not realize how much I missed actual connection. Day 35, my boss called me into his office. Your work quality has doubled this month. What changed? I told him about the bet. He said, whatever you are doing, keep doing it. Day 40, Emma was getting nervous. She invited me to every family event, trying to trigger me. Left her phone on the table with notifications going off.

There was one where she was wearing the sapphire necklace I gave her for our anniversary. At 7 in the evening, I emailed everything to Patrick's boss with a simple message. I wrote, thought you would want to know who your regional director is traveling with. I included the HR complaints against him, proof of the affair and documentation that my kids were missing. The next morning, I arranged a meeting. Jessica walked into the conference room and froze when she saw her boss, an HR rep and my attorney waiting. Her face went white. I played the security footage. She watched herself kiss Patrick. Check into the room, everything. Her boss spoke first. He said, effective immediately, you are suspended pending investigation. I slid divorce papers across the table, full custody, asset division, everything already filed. Her hands shook as she opened the folder. She whispered, you planned all this. I said calmly, no, you plan this, I just responded. She started crying. She said, please do not do this. I replied, you already did. Her boss left. My attorney confirmed everything was legal. Jessica just sat there, Roy. But here's the thing. I still did not know where my kids were. The message said, your kids are safe. We will return them tomorrow. It was signed with just the letter. P's wife. Patrick's wife, Rachel, had figured it out, too. She had tracked Patrick's location, found my kids at The lakehouse he had arranged and kept them safe until she could reach me. She had been gathering her own evidence. Two days later, both Jessica and Patrick were fired. I got full custody. Rachel filed for divorce, too. The hotel manager had accidentally exposed everything by making one phone call. One mistake that unraveled two families but also saved four kids from parents who had forgotten what actually mattered. Jessica tried apologizing for months. I never responded. I just focused on Tyler and Sophie, who are doing great now. Sometimes the truth comes from the most unexpected places, like a nervous hotel manager who thought he was just correcting a booking error.

She believed in second chances. She believed people could change. He paused. But forgiveness doesn't mean no consequences. Forgiveness doesn't mean what you did was okay. Morrison smile faded. Noah turned to the judge. Your honor, I've done a lot of research over the past three years. I've read every case file I could access. I've studied sentencing guidelines. I've watched dozens of trials. He pulled, pulled out his phone and held it up. I have spreadsheets. This man has three prior Duis. Three. He killed my mother while driving on a suspended license. His blood alcohol was twice the legal limit at two PM on a Tuesday. The prosecutor was nodding. Morrison's lawyer stood up to object, but the judge waved him down. His lawyer argued he deserves leniency because he has a family that depends on him, because he's a respected member of the community, because one mistake shouldn't define his entire life. Noah's voice got quieter. Your honor, my mom had a family, too. I'm her family. And I did more research. Defendants who show genuine remorse typically receive lighter sentences. The court considers their acceptance of responsibility. He turned back to Morrison who was staring at the table again. Mr Morrison, you've sat through three days of testimony. You've heard what you took from us. You've seen the photos. You've heard the 9, 1, 1 call where my mom was pronounced dead at the scene. Noah's voice didn't shake once. So I have one question for you, and I'd like you to answer honestly. The whole courtroom leaned forward. If our roles were reversed and I had killed your wife while driving drunk with a suspended license, would you forgive me? Morrison went pale. His mouth opened, but nothing came out. His lawyer grabbed his arm and whispered urgently in his ear, but Morrison just sat there frozen. Ten seconds of silence. 20:30, Noah said quietly, your silence is your answer, sir Bayleaf. The judge's voice cracked like a. Remove this young man from my courtroom immediately. You do not address the defendant directly. That's contempt. Two bailiffs moved toward Noah. He picked up his paper and walked out with them. Head high. The judge turned to Morrison. Her expression completely changed. Sentencing is in two weeks. I'll be reviewing those case files. Mister Brooks mentioned Morrison got the maximum, 15 years.

And I couldn't be more proud of him. Noah was 16 when his mother died. A drunk driver ran a red light at 70 miles per hour and hit her car on the passenger side. She died instantly. Driver walked away with a broken arm. That was three years ago. The trial kept getting delayed because the defendant's lawyer filed motion after motion. Each delay felt like another punch to the gut. But finally we got our day in court. The defendant's name was Richard Morrison. Mid forties, owned a successful contracting business. Had a wife and two teenage daughters. His lawyer made sure everyone knew about his family, his community involvement, his church donations. They painted him as a good man who made one terrible mistake. During the trial, I watched Morrison sit there in his expensive suit. No emotion, no remorse. When the prosecutor showed photos of the crash scene, he looked bored. When they played the 9 1 1 call, he checked his watch. The worst part was during victim impact statements, my sister spoke about how her kids lost their favorite aunt. Noah's grandmother talked about burying her only daughter. Morrison just stared at the table. Once, I swear I saw him smirk when my mother in law broke down crying. His lawyer kept objecting, saying the statements were too emotional and prejudicial. The judge allowed them, but you could tell She was getting tired of the theatrics from both sides. Then it was Noah's turn. He'd been silent through the entire trial. Hadn't cried once in three years. At least not in front of me. He thrown himself into school, graduated early, got into engineering programs at three universities. Everyone said he was handling it well. Too well, maybe. He stood up and walked to the podium. He was wearing the suit we bought for his mother's funeral. It fit him better now. The courtroom went completely silent. Even Morrison's lawyer stopped shuffling papers. Noah placed a single sheet of paper on the podium, but didn't look at it. He stared directly at Morrison. The judge leaned forward. You may begin whenever you're ready. Noah took a breath. Mr. Morrison, I forgive you. I felt my heart stop. What was he doing? Morrison's face relaxed. His lawyer actually smiled and nodded like they just won the case. I heard someone behind me whisper angrily about how could he just forgive him like that? Then Noah continued, his voice steady and clear. I forgive you because

It was the most direct she'd been in over a year. And I felt nothing, no excitement, no anticipation, just this weird, hollow feeling. I gently moved her arms away and said, I'm pretty tired tonight, maybe another time, and went to watch TV. The next morning she tried again, made my favorite breakfast, wore the dress I used to love, even put on perfume. At 7:00am on a Saturday, she sat next to me on the couch and put her hand on my thigh. All I could think was how strange it felt, like a performance I wasn't interested in watching. I, I told her I had yard work planned and needed to get started. The look on her face was complete confusion, but I genuinely just wanted to mow the lawn. That night, I found her crying in our bedroom. When I asked what was wrong, she said, do you even love me anymore? You've rejected me twice in two days. That's not like you. I sat down next to her and calmly explained everything, how the years of constant rejection made me feel worthless, how I couldn't keep living in that cycle of hope and disappointment, how I'd spent the last six months retraining my brain to stop seeing her that way. And it finally worked. I told her I still loved her, still wanted to be married, but I couldn't go back to being the desperate husband waiting. For scraps of affection. She absolutely lost it, started yelling that I was being cruel, that I was punishing her, that this was revenge for all the times she said no, accused me of having an affair, said there was no way I could just turn off my attraction unless I was getting it somewhere else. I stayed calm and told her I wasn't cheating, wasn't planning to leave, just protecting myself. Then she said, you're throwing it in my face that I don't want it as much as you do. I can't help the way I am. I looked at her and said, and I can't help the way I am either. You spent four years training me not to want you and now that it worked, you're upset. You don't get to reject me for years and then be when I stop asking. We argued in circles for 2 hours. She kept saying I was being unfair, that I should have tried harder to communicate. I kept saying I communicated for years and nothing changed, that I'm not giving up on the marriage, just on the part that was killed. Finally she said, so what? You're just gonna be my roommate forever. We're going to raise our kids and never be intimate again. I told her honestly, I don't know. But what I do know is I can't go back to the way things were. That version of me is gone. She hasn't spoken to me in nine Days she sleeps in the guest room. Now the kids have noticed something's wrong, but we're keeping it together for them. I don't know if I did the right thing, but I know I can't unfeel what I've Learned to stop feeling.

And it was cruel what they put her through. But the career she claims he stole, that never existed. She was a C and d student who partied too much and had no plans for after graduation. After we hung up, I sat staring at my phone. My mom had been wronged, genuinely victimized by her parents forced birth decision. But she'd spent 18 years punishing me for failures that predated my existence. The next day, I called my mom and told her I needed to see her immediately. When I arrived at her apartment, she was defensive before I even sat down. What's this about? I told her about Diana, about what I'd Learned. My mom's face drained of color. You had no right to contact my old friends and you had no right to lie to me for 18 years. She tried to argue that Diana was misremembering, that her grades weren't that bad, that there had been opportunities. I just didn't understand. I showed her the messages from Diana on my phone, the direct quotes about skipping class and failing. She stared at the screen and when she looked up, her voice turned sharp. You're taking the word of someone you barely know over your own mother. The guilt trip almost worked. That familiar weight pressing on my chest. Then I realized what she was doing. Show me one piece of evidence that proves your story. One scholarship letter, one award, one teacher recommendation, anything she Opened her mouth and closed it. The fight went out of her completely. Stop, she said quietly. Just stop. We sat in silence. When she finally spoke, her voice was hollow. I was failing school. I had no scholarship offers. I wasn't good at volleyball or art or anything else. Hearing her admit it felt surreal after a lifetime of lies. Then why? Because the alternative was admitting I was nobody special, that my life was already going nowhere before I got pregnant. She looked up at me with tears streaming down her face. When people asked what I'd given up to have you, I started saying things, all things at first, then bigger things. Eventually, I believed my own story because it hurt less than the truth. What truth? That I was already failing at life before you existed. That I would have probably dropped out anyway. That you weren't the reason my life went nowhere. I was. She was crying fully now. I made you carry guilt that wasn't yours because I couldn't carry my own shame. You were 16. You deserved better than what happened to you. Maybe, but you deserved better than a mother who blamed you for her own failures. We talked maybe twice a year now, and she stopped telling people I ruined her life, probably because she finally had to admit to herself that there wasn't much of one to ruin.

He looked at Marcus. You want to press charges? Marcus stared at the floor. She's Claire's sister, and she just tried to destroy your wedding. The ceremony started on time. I walked down the aisle to. Marcus looked at me like I was the only person in the world. Brianna stood at the altar in her lavender made of honor dress, holding my backup bouquet, smiling like nothing happened. We got to the vows, then Derek stood up. Before we continue, the bride has evidence she'd like to present regarding threats made this morning. Confusion rippled through the guests. Brianna's smile faltered. Derek pulled out a portable speaker, pressed play. Brianna's voice filled The chapel. He proposed to the wrong sister Claire. Everyone knows it. Gasps, whispers my mother's hand flew to her mouth. The recording continued. Every word, every threat, every manipulation attempt. Or you walk out there and call it off. I'll comfort him. We'll be together by Christmas. The chapel went dead silent except for the recording. Brianna's face drained of all color. She looked around at 200 people staring at her. Marcus turned to her slowly. Leave. Marcus. I can explain. I was just. Leave now. She tried to speak. His mother stood up and pointed at the door. Brianna's hands trembled. She dropped the bouquet, ran down the aisle in her heels, crying, pushing past guests who pulled away from her like she was contagious. Door slammed. Marcus took my hands. Let's get married. We finished our vows. When he kissed me, the entire chapel erupted in applause. At the reception, someone asked about the empty maid of honor spot at our table. Marcus smiled, squeezed my hand. We only keep honest people in our lives.

For context, I'm 38, she's 36, and we've been married for 15 years. We have two kids, 14 and 11. And for the most part, we get along great. She's my best friend. We laugh together. We parent well together. And I can honestly say I still care about her deeply. But our intimate life has been dead for years. It wasn't always like this. First seven or eight years were amazing. We couldn't keep our hands off each other. Even with young kids and crazy schedules, we made it work. But around four years ago, something shifted. She started turning me down constantly. At first it was once a month, then every two months, and basically never unless she initiated, which happened maybe four times a year. I tried everything, planned date nights. She'd cancel because she was too tired. Suggested weekend mornings when the kids were at friend's houses. She'd suddenly need to deep clean closets, bought her favorite wine, cooked her favorite meals, left work early to help around the house so she'd be less stressed. Nothing worked. Every rejection chipped away at me. I'd lie in bed next to her feeling like a strange in my own marriage. The worst part, she'd still cuddle me, hold my hand, kiss my cheek, tell me she loved me every day. But the second I tried to take things further, she'd go Cold. It felt like living with someone who loved me just enough to keep me around but not enough to actually want me. I brought it up so many times. She'd always say, I'm just stressed. Work has been crazy. I'm touched out from the kids. Can we talk about this later? Later never came. So about six months ago, something in me just broke, not in an angry way, but in a survival way. I realized I had two choices, keep destroying myself by wanting someone who didn't want me back or train my brain to stop wanting her all together. I chose option 2. I started treating her exactly like I treat my closest male friends, friendly, supportive, caring, but zero romantic thoughts. Never my mind wandered that direction. I'd shut it down immediately and redirect to something else. At first it was torture, but after a few months it actually worked. I stopped seeing her as my wife and started seeing her as just my friend and co parent. During those six months, she didn't notice a thing. I was still kind, still helpful, still asked about her day. I just stopped initiating anything physical, stopped the lingering hugs, the 30 comments, the hopeful glances and she didn't even register the change. Then last Tuesday happened. I was loading the dishwasher after dinner when she came up behind me, wrapped her arms around my waist, kissed my neck and with.

It's only 3:00. He has homework. I looked at Tyler. Is that true? Mark's fingers pressed into Tyler's neck. Tell her. Tyler's voice shook. I have homework. You're not taking him anywhere. I stood in front of the door. Mark's smile faded. Move, Jesse. Not until Tyler tells me he wants to go. Lauren grabbed my arm. What is wrong with you? Ask Tyler why he requested peanut butter. Tyler, tell your mom. Tyler's voice was barely a whisper. I didn't mean to. Yes, you did. That was our signal from when you were 6. My mom stepped closer. What signal? After Tyler's dad died, we made a pact if Tyler asked for peanut butter, it meant he needed help. My dad frowned. That seems extreme. Tyler hasn't asked for peanut butter in four years. Why? Today, Mark's hand was still on Tyler's neck. Kids do weird things. Let go of him or what? Mark's voice had an edge. Or I'm calling the police. Lauren laughed at her. You're calling the police because Tyler asked for a sandwich. Look at Tyler's face. He's terrified. My dad looked. Tyler was hale, shaking, tears running down his cheeks. Tyler, what's wrong? Tyler tried to speak, but nothing came out. Mark leaned down, whispered something in Tyler's ear. Tyler's eyes went wide. What did you just say? I told him to stop crying. Tyler, take off your jacket. Lauren looked at me like I was Crazy. Just do it, Tyler. Mark's grip on Tyler's neck tightened. We're leaving now. He tried to push past me, but I didn't move. My dad put his hand on Mark's shoulder. Maybe we should talk. There's nothing to talk about. He's not your son, I said quietly. Mark's face changed. All pretends gone. He's more mine than his dead father's. Lauren gasped. Tyler pulled away from Mark suddenly and ripped his jacket off. Bruises covered both arms, handprint bruises, dark purple and yellow, fresh ones over old ones. My mom made a sound like she'd been hit. Mark's voice went flat. He bruises easily. Soccer. Those are handprints, my dad said, his voice shaking. Tyler, did Mark do this? Tyler nodded, still crying. He said, if I told anyone, he'd give me peanut butter when I was sleeping. Everyone would think it was an accident. Mark was arrested for felony child abuse and Lauren's in therapy working through the guilt of choosing him over seeing the truth. Tyler's been with me for 4 months, gaining weight and smiling again. Yesterday when I asked what kind of sandwich he wanted, I said anything but peanut butter, and we both laughed. I hope he never has to request it again.

When the er doctor asked why a 14 year old was listed as emergency contact for three different kids. I woke up in the hospital with no memory of how I got there, the doctor said. I'd collapsed at school from severe exhaustion and malnutrition. We need to call your parents, she said, looking at my chart with confusion. They're at work. Call my emergency contact. She frowned. Honey, you are the emergency contact for Ellis Carver, age 8, Grant Carver, age six, and Nora Carver, age 4. Those are my siblings. I'm their contact because my parents travel for work constantly. The doctor sat down heavily. How often do your parents travel? Maybe three weeks out every month, sometimes 4. Her expression changed completely. And you watch your siblings during those three weeks? One has to. The babysitter only comes during school hours when I can't be there. What about nights? I handle night time completely. Bedtime stories, diaper changes, sick kids, nightmares, everything. How long has this been going on? Since Alice was born. Eight years. She put down her pen. You've been a full time parent since you were 6 years old. I laughed. No, I just help out. The doctor didn't laugh. In Morocco, I froze. How do you know they're in Morocco? We've been trying to reach them for six hours. The hotel said they're on a couple's retreat with no interruptions for five days. My heart stopped. But Nora has her dance recital tomorrow. Grant has a doctor's appointment. Who is taking them? Me, obviously. Doctor Harper was quiet. Then she asked, when did you last have a full night's sleep? I couldn't remember. When did you last eat without cutting someone else's food first? I, I didn't remember that either. When did you last do something just for you, something that wasn't about taking care of someone else? The question made me panic. I don't need to. The kids need, the kids need parents. You need to be a kid yourself. That's when I started crying and couldn't stop. Doctor Harper stayed while they ran more tests. Severe anemia, chronic sleep deprivation, anxiety levels so high they wanted me overnight for monitoring. We have to report this, she said gently. A 14 year old shouldn't be the primary caregiver for three young children. Please don't. My parents aren't bad people. They work 75%.

Where do you think we're going? I don't know, dude. But with how mad she is, I wouldn't be surprised if it's Valhalla. We ended up at the principal's office. The principal was there waiting. So was a police officer. My stomach dropped. We all sat down. The officer had a notepad. Nobody was talking. We were all staring at each other. What the the hell was happening? The teacher stood at the front, arms crossed. All of you watch anime, correct? We nodded. Who here has seen Dragon Ball Z? 9 hands went up. One kid's hands stayed down. Dexter piped, you haven't seen Dragon Ball Z, dude? Yo, you gotta watch it. Shut up, idiot. The teacher interrupted. Dexter, you. She pointed at the kid who hadn't seen Dragon Ball. Back to class. She just called Dexter an idiot. And the principal didn't even flinch. Whatever happened had to have been really serious. Teacher continued, who here has seen Naruto? Two more kids lowered their Hands. You two leave. Seven of us left. Now I looked at John. He was pale, hands gripping his knees. Who here has seen one piece? Three kids shook their heads out. Just five of us now, me, John and three others. My heart was pounding. The officer was taking notes on his clipboard. Who here draws anime like manga art, the teacher asked. The three other kids hesitated, then shook their heads. Back to class. Just me and John left. The teacher stared at us. Her jaw was clenched. You too. Back to the classroom. We'll call you later. We stood up immediately and walked out in silence. In the hallway, John's hands were shaking. Dude, what was that? I whispered. I don't know, man. Something in his voice sounded wrong. We got back to class. Everyone stared at us. What happened, someone asked. We didn't answer. The rumors started immediately, whispers spreading through the room. Lunch came and went. I couldn't eat. After lunch, the teacher walked back in. You too? She pointed at me and John. I need you to grab one of your anime drawings, bring it to the principal's office. My mouth went dry. We went to our lockers. I grabbed my sketchbook. John grabbed his. We walked to the office together. John wasn't talking. His face was white. We entered the office.

I was jogging through the park, like every Tuesday morning, when something slammed into me from behind. My face hit the pavement. Someone's knee drove into my spine. Don't move! Hands behind your back. I couldn't breathe, couldn't see. Taste of blood in my mouth. Metal cuffs bit into my wrists. I tried to turn my head and saw four cops, guns drawn, surrounding me. What the hell? Shut up! Landon Morales, you're under arrest for the murder of Tori Doxson. What? Who? They yanked me to my feet. Other joggers had stopped, phones out, filming. My shirt was torn, blood dripping from my nose. Tori Doxson, you're. We found your DNA under her fingernails. I don't understand. You strangled her four days ago. I've never strangled anyone. They shoved me toward a police car. A woman I recognized was recording me. That's the high school teacher, she said to someone on her phone. By the time we reached the station, my phone had dozens of missed calls. My wife, my principal, the school district, my wife's text. What did you do? Not what happened, but what did you do? Like she'd already decided I was guilty. Detective's hand slammed on the metal table. I flinched. Why'd you kill her? He was six inches from my face. Why'd you strangle that girl? I didn't. Your DNA Was under her fingernails. We have you. My hands were shaking. He threw down a lab report. 99.99% match. That's you. That's your DNA embedded under her nails when she fought back. I never touched her. I taught her biology three years ago. Liar. He slammed the table again. I jumped. My public defender sat beside me, saying nothing. Later, a female detective laid out more evidence. You called Tori Two days before she died. 9:52 p m. 6 minute conversation. Had I? Maybe she called about a college recommendation. At 9:52 at night? I don't remember. Doubt crept in. Why couldn't I remember? And the eyewitness? Tori's roommate, identified me in a line. That's him. I saw him outside our building that night. I've never been to her apartment. They searched my classroom and found Tori's class photo in my desk drawer. Just hers. I didn't remember keeping it. Students gave me photos all the time. But why only hers? The prosecution's expert witness testified at the preliminary hearing. Silver haired woman with thirty years of experience. This DNA match is conclusive. The probability that this belongs to anyone other than Mr. Morales is statistically impossible. This is his DNA. Period. My lawyer didn't cross examine. My wife stopped visiting after two weeks. Text. They found her photo in your desk. I need to protect kids. Former students gave statements. Five said I made them uncomfortable. One claimed I stood too close. Another said I kept her after class. I'd never been inappropriate, but their statements built a narrative. My GPS showed I was in her neighborhood that night. I drive through there to get to the gym. At eleven PM, my lawyer met with me in the holding cell. The DA offered 25 years instead of life without Parole. I'm innocent. Your DNA is under her fingernails. An expert said it's statistically impossible it's anyone else. A witness identified you. Take the deal or die in prison. That night, I. At the plea agreement, everyone believed I did it. The evidence was overwhelming. DNA doesn't lie, they kept saying. I started wondering if I was losing my mind. If somehow I'd done something I couldn't remember. How else could my DNA be under a dead girl's fingernails? I was staring at the plea agreement in hand when my public defender's phone rang. He stepped out, came back five minutes later looking confused. Don't sign anything. What? An independent forensic lab contacted the DA's office. They reviewed your case as part of a state audit. My heart pounded. And there's a problem with the DNA evidence. They brought me to a conference room. The DA was there with a woman in a lab coat. She looks sick. Mr. Morales? I'm Doctor Monica Sax from the state forensic review board.

Oh, my gosh, you don't know yet. The phone rang and she grabbed it like a lifeline, turning away to whisper urgently. She hung up and turned back around, her professional smile looking forced and wrong. Your aunt is coming to pick you up. Just sit right there. Why is my aunt coming to pick me up?

When my dad married Cassandra, I was 11. Mom had been gone for 13 months, melanoma that spread faster than anyone expected. One day she was complaining about a headache, and 82 days later, I was standing at her grave in a black dress that still had the tags on. Dad waited exactly one year before bringing Cassandra home. She worked at his investment firm, Client Relations, perfect teeth, blond hair that never moved, the kind of woman who wore heels to other people's barbecues. She makes me happy again, dad explained, his voice gentle but firm. I need you to try, Emily. So I tried. I helped Cassandra move in, carrying boxes of designer shoes to the closet where Mom's gardening clothes used to hang. I nodded politely when she rearranged our furniture, replacing family photos with abstract art that opened up the space. I even smiled when she transformed Mom's vegetable garden into a meditation patio because growing our own food is so provincial. For three years, I performed the role of grateful stepdaughter. I attended her corporate events wearing the dresses she bought me. I tolerated her friends who cooed about how mature I was for 14. I kept my grief hidden behind perfect grades and false smiles. Dad didn't notice when I stopped laughing, too busy with Cassandra's social calendar and the new clients she brought In too distracted by their couples retreats and wine club memberships. Meanwhile, I slept with Mom's sweater under my pillow until it stopped smelling like her. Cassandra tried in her way. She bought me expensive birthday gifts, always things she would want. She hosted elaborate dinner parties and introduced me as our daughter to important people who never remembered my name. She even started a college fund for me, making sure everyone knew about her generosity. But when I got my period for the first time, it was Google that taught me what to do. When I had nightmares about mom dying, it was the family dog who comforted me. The breaking point came during sophomore year. I was cast as the lead in the school play, the first thing I'd felt passionate about since mom died. Opening night fell on the same evening as Cassandra's charity gala. Obviously, you'll need to skip the performance, she said, not looking up from her phone. The Richardson's are bringing their son. He's at Princeton Connections. Emily Dad started to object, then stopped when Cassandra placed her hand on his arm. It's just a high school play, he finally said. There will be others. I went to my room and pulled out the antique jewelry box mom had left me. Inside was her wedding ring, a lock of my baby hair and a journal I'd never opened, too afraid of confronting her final thoughts that night. Through tears, I read it cover to Cover. Most of it was what you'd expect, her hopes for my future, memories she cherished, advice she wouldn't be.

He's a coward who ran away from us. the general walked in and said something that changed everything. I'm 28, just back from my third deployment to Afghanistan. My brother Marcus is 31 and thinks I'm the worst person alive. See, our dad built Parker Construction from nothing, worked 60 hour weeks for 40 years to create something real. He wanted both his sons to take it over, keep it in the family. But when I turned 18, I enlisted instead. Didn't ask permission, didn't discuss it, just showed up at dinner one night and told them I'd already signed the papers. Dad didn't speak to me for a month. Marcus called me selfish, said I was abandoning the family legacy for some hero fantasy. Then two years into my service, dad got sick, stage 4 cancer. The treatments weren't covered by insurance and the ones that might actually save him were experimental and cost of fortune. Marcus had to take over the business alone while dad fought for his life. I stayed deployed, missed Dad's surgery, missed his worst days, missed ever everything. Marcus never forgave me. The homecoming ceremony is packed with maybe 200 people in the base auditorium, families holding American flags, kids bouncing around in their Sunday best, a local news crew in the back corner. I'm standing at attention in my dress blues with my Unit first row, trying not to scan the crowd for my family's faces. Face. Commander is mid speech talking about service and sacrifice when I hear the commotion at the back doors. Excuse me, sir, you can't get out of my way. Marcus shoves past a security officer and storms down the center aisle. He's wearing jeans and a wrinkled button up. His face already red and twisted. Every head turns. The commander stops talking. The room goes dead silent except for Marcus's footsteps echoing on the tile floor. He stops 10 feet from me and points his hand shaking. Stop clapping for him. This man is not a hero. I'm still at attention. Eyes forward, jaw clenched. I can't move, can't respond, not while in formation. This coward abandoned our dying father. Marcus's voice crack.

Daniel had always totally been the class clown. He always got in trouble for doing the silliest things, like putting whoopee cushions on the seats before or other kids could sit down, and he always seemed to get away with it. Some kids got mad at him for it, especially when he did his prank call rounds, but most just laughed in his face. Until one day he didn't get away with a practical joke gone wrong. One day he was totally in rare form and pulling classic pranks on even the teachers in including Mr. Draper. Before he had the chance to plan this one prank, he totally sprung it on his friend Ryan. While we were all taking an exam. Our teacher said he'd be right back and told us not to cheat while he left the room and took his short little coffee break. As soon as he came back into the room, Daniel said with the most serious yet lively expression on his face, stop cheating, Ryan! And slapped him on the arm as if putting on a theatrical performance. We all half expect did our teacher to either send him to the principal, kick him out completely, or god knows what else, but all he did was chuckle loudly, lean his head back while grabbing his coffee mug, and say cheating! As if in Disbelief! But Ryan was clearly upset. I wasn't cheating! He shouted back at Daniel. Uh oh! It looked like things were quickly taking a turn for the worse. Now that's enough, boys! The teacher scolded, trying to break the tension up between them. There will be no cheating here today, the teacher ordered. But if you'd like to go visit Principal Matthews office, you're more than welcome, he said softly but sternly. Sure, Daniel said, with excitement in his voice, that I wasn't sure it was fair or not. He was just so good at putting on acts that no one knew when he was ever serious or not. But much to my surprise, he actually did walk out of the classroom quickly, making his way toward the principal's office. Right after that, Ryan left, and then one by one, student after student made their way out of the classroom, until before I knew it, the only ones left in the room were Mister Draper and myself. I wasn't sure who was more confused, myself or him, until a loud commotion reached our ears. It was Daniel's parents, followed by Daniel! Daniel, what happened? I whispered, hoping I wasn't disrupting anything important between him and his parents. But student after student trickled into the classroom right after him. What? What's going on? I said, shaking my head in confusion. He's under arrest! Daniel's father shouted, with the cops trickling in right behind him. I couldn't believe it. What did he Do to get him arrested, I shouted at the cops, hoping they'd hear me. Excuse me, young sir, but we need you to clear the room, the cops said to me, quickly handcuffing Mister Adraper without further explanation.

She picked the wrong man. My fiance and I exchanged glances. I replied, perfect and got security to kick her out. The same night she texted, don't forget the mortgage payment and the Tesla car loan payments are tomorrow. I stared at that text until my hands stopped shaking. On read over my shoulder, what mortgage? What Tesla? That's when six years of lies came pouring out. When I was 22, my mother called crying, dad made bad investments. They'd lose the house. Could I help just temporarily? I co signed a 60 thousand dollar mortgage refinance. Six months later, I co signed a 55 thousand dollar Tesla loan. Because he deserves something nice. I promised to make every payment. I'd never see a Bill except the backup. Automatic transfers from my account became the primary. $700 monthly for the mortgage, $800 for the Tesla, plus insurance, taxes, emergencies, nearly $2,000 vanishing every month for six years. $150,000 of my money gone. I've been packing lunches and skipping trips thinking I was saving for our wedding. But I was barely breaking even, drowning while my mother pushed me under inch by inch. When I felt stressed about money, she'd say, you make good money, you're just bad with budgeting. She gaslit me into thinking I was the problem. John asked what I wanted to do. I logged into my bank and deleted every Automatic payment authorization. Then I screenshot the confirmation and sent it to my mother with one message. You said you weren't paying for the circus. I'm not paying for your life anymore. I blocked her number, turned off my phone, let John hold me while I shook apart. The next morning brought 17 missed calls on John's phone. My mother's friends, my aunts, cousins, the family network activated with one message. I was selfish, ungrateful, destroying my family over one little disagreement. She'd recruited everyone to tell me so. Then my mother's lawyer sent a letter threatening to sue me for emotional distress and financial damage caused by my unwarranted withdrawal of support. She was threatening legal action for stopping payments on debts that were legally theirs. I hired a lawyer. Jennifer reviewed everything and smiled with steel in her eyes. Your mother doesn't have a case. If she pursues this, we'll counter sue for financial abuse. We'll expose every transfer, every guilt trip, every manipulative text. We'll make this so ugly she'll wish she never picked up the phone. Two weeks before the wedding, the mortgage payment bounced. My credit dropped 30 points. The Tesla payment bounced. Next day, another hit. Then Jennifer discovered something. My mother had been making minimum payments with my money while telling relatives.

The officer's face hardened. Where's the child's father? Stepfather Brad Morrison. Business trip. They took statements, photographed the padlock, the empty bottles. Your grandson needs to stay with someone. The officer said. We're opening an investigation. He's staying with me. My phone rang at 11:30. Unknown number. This is Brad Morrison. What the hell is going on? Your wife is in the hospital. Your stepson was locked in his room starving. That's ridiculous. Rebecca's being dramatic. She tried to kill herself. You left a 7 year old alone with her. I was closing a deal in Chicago. You locked him in his room, Brad? Silence. I did not. There's a padlock on his door. The police photographed it. Ethan told them everything. That kid is a liar. He's always causing problems. I hung up. Brad showed up at the hospital the next morning. Expensive suit, fake concern. He tried to see Rebecca. They wouldn't let him in. He tried to see. I stood in his way. Move, Brad said no. Security removed him. Two days later, Rebecca woke up. Where's Ethan? With me? Safe. She started crying. I'm sorry. I couldn't take it anymore. I said if I left him, he'd make sure I never saw Ethan again. He controlled everything. Did he lock Ethan in his room? She nodded. He said Ethan needed discipline. He'd lock him in there for hours, sometimes overnight. The police came that afternoon, recorded everything. Brad was arrested. Three days later, child endangerment, neglect, false imprisonment. His lawyer tried to make a deal. The prosecutor refused. The trial was two months later. The courtroom was packed, reporters, family, Brad's business colleagues who'd come to see the fall. Ethan had to testify. Seven years old, describing being locked in his room, describing the hunger, the fear. Brad sat in his expensive suit smirking. The jury deliberated for 90 minutes. Guilty on all counts. Brad's face went white. His lawyer whispered frantically in his ear. Sentencing was immediate. The judge looked at Brad with disgust. Mister Morrison, you present yourself as a successful businessman, a pillar of the community. The judge's voice carried through the packed courtroom. But you're nothing more than a child abuser who locked a seven year old in a room and left him to starve while his mother overdosed. Brad opened his mouth. The judge raised a hand. What he said next made him panic. Full story on the channel linked below.

And when I confronted her, my wife snapped, she's not your daughter. Don't correct her. I just smiled. I've been married to Lauren for four years. Her daughter, Emma was 10 when we met and now she's 14. From day one, I tried to be a good stepdad. I helped with homework, attended every soccer game, drove her to sleepovers, never tried to replace her dad, who sees her every other weekend. But I showed up consistently in ways he never did. Last month, we hosted Thanksgiving at our place, my parents, my sister's family, Lauren's mom, the whole crew. Emma had been Moody all week, typical teenager stuff. But I figured she'd behave with company around. Wrong. During dinner, my mom asked Emma about her science project. I'd spent three nights helping her build a model of the solar system. Before Emma could answer, I jumped in proudly. We worked really hard on it. Emma did an amazing job with the research. Emma's face went cold. We didn't do anything, she said loud enough for everyone to hear. You're not my dad. Stop acting like you contributed to my project. The table went silent. Fork stopped midair. My mom's smile faded. Kept my voice calm. Emma, that's disrespectful. I was just, that's when Lauren cut me off. She's not your daughter. Don't correct her. Her tone was sharp, final, like I'd crossed some invisible line. My sister's eyes went wide. My dad set down his wine glass. Slowly, Lauren continued. Emma has a father. You need to remember your place. Something shifted in that moment. Four years of early morning pancakes, of staying up late helping with math homework, of being there when her actual dad forgot her birthday, all reduced to remember your place. I smiled, not a happy smile, the kind of smile that happens when everything suddenly becomes crystal clear. You're absolutely right, I said quietly. I apologize for overstepping. I finished my dinner in silence while conversation awkwardly resumed around me. That night, after everyone left, I started making calls, first to my accountant, then to a lawyer. You see, what Lauren didn't know was that I've been covering Emma's private school tuition, $18,000 a year. Her dad was supposed to pay half for their divorce agreement, but he never did. And Lauren's salary couldn't stretch that far. I've been quietly.

For the next two hours, I ignore every call and text. Eventually they give up and drive all the way back home with both cars still packed full. Saturday morning I call my dad. I apologize for being such a coward and tell him I thought about it all night. And he's right, Ted should move in with me. I want to make it up to them. So I went and bought Ted a moving in gift. I send him a photo I took at the furniture store of this really nice mattress and wooden bed frame. It's got built in drawers and a fancy headboard. Cost like 15 bucks apparently. My dad gets all excited and shows my mom. She calls me all happy. I'm like, yeah, I thought Ted would really like the cherry wood finish. They're going on about how generous I am and how Ted will finally have a nice bed. Then I'm like, you know what, maybe Ted doesn't deserve such a nice gift right away. How about he takes your old guest bed and mattress and you guys keep the new stuff for yourselves, the thank you for raising him. They eat it up. My mom literally starts crying she's so happy. They spend Saturday taking apart their old guest bed, which is this massive heavy thing with drawers underneath. They load it into my dad's truck along with the old mattress. Sunday afternoon, they show up again, both cars packed with Ted's stuff plus this huge bed frame in the truck. They start calling me to open the garage. I'm not home. I'm at the same bar having wings. They call me like 15 times. I finally pick up after an hour and tell them I changed my mind again. Then I hang up. My dad calls back immediately screaming. I don't answer. They sit in my driveway for another 30 minutes calling and texting. I block their numbers temporarily. Eventually they load everything back up and drive home again. Monday morning I unblock them and call my dad. I apologize again and say I was wrong and Ted can move in today if they want. My dad absolutely loses it. He starts yelling about how he wasted his whole 3 day weekend, how much gas money they spent, how his back hurts from moving that stupid bed frame twice. I tell him I understand why he's upset, but I'm ready now. He says there's no way in hell he believes me. I'm like, yeah, you're probably right. You can't believe me. So you should probably just stop asking me about Ted moving in. He hung up on me. Haven't heard from them since.

I pretended I didn't speak English around him for six months and heard everything he said when he thought I couldn't understand. My daughter Emma started dating this guy, Kyle, last year. Nice looking kid, always super polite around me and my wife. Maybe too polite. He'd bring flowers every time he came over, always offered to help with dishes, called me Sir Non Stop. Something felt rehearsed about it. I was born in Brazil but moved here when I was 10. No accent at all anymore. But my parents taught me to never lose my Portuguese. One night at dinner, Emma mentioned that Kyle was taking Spanish in college. I got this crazy idea. Next time he came over, I pretended I barely spoke English, just smiled, nodded and spoke Portuguese with Emma translating. Said I'd had a stroke that affected my language center. Emma was confused but played along when I explained my plan in private. She thought I was being ridiculous but agreed to help. The first few weeks, Kyle was exactly the same. Be respectful, patient with the language barrier. He even downloaded a translation app. By month two, cracks started showing. When Emma left to use the bathroom, he'd mutter things under his breath. This food is disgusting. How long is this dinner going to take? Once I heard him quietly mock my accent to himself, I pretended not to notice, just smiled and offered more. Food. When Emma's birthday came around, Kyle showed up with an expense so bracelet. Later, I overheard him on the phone in our backyard. Yeah, I returned the cheap one and got the silver one instead. Her dad's loaded. Gotta look the part. That was interesting. I'm comfortable but definitely not loaded. We live in a normal three bedroom house. I drive a 2016 Subaru. One Saturday, Emma had a shift at the hospital. She's in nursing school. Kyle came by anyway, said he left his charger. I let him in, still doing my broken English act while I pretended to watch a Portuguese soccer game. He took pictures of our mail, our investment statements, even opened my desk drawer when he thought I wasn't looking. The next week, I accidentally left fake bank statements showing a negative balance and massive debt on the kitchen counter just to see what would happen. Three days later, Kyle told Emma he needed space and wasn't sure about their relationship. Said he wanted to find himself before getting serious with anyone. Emma was heartbroken but suspicious. She asked if my test had shown anything. I told her everything I'd heard. We waited to see if Kyle would come back once the fake bank statements disappear here. Sure enough, two weeks later, he texted her saying he'd worked through his issues and wanted to try again. Emma invited him over for dinner. He brought the usual flowers, called me sir again. I served his Favorite meal, the one he'd called rusting behind my back. Halfway through dinner, Emma started speaking to me in perfect English. I responded the same way. Kyle froze with his fork halfway to his mouth. You, you speak English, he stammered, looking at me. I've spoken English for 35 years, I said.

Clients got angry fast. By the end of the week, the owner dragged both of us into his office. Rick puffed up his chest and said my job was simple and that I was dropping the ball. I explained the timing issue and the owner immediately turned to Rick with a look that said everything. Suddenly, Mister Operations Director backed down and told me to return to my old schedule starting Monday. I smiled and said I won't be here Monday. His face twisted instantly. I told him my two week vacation had been approved by Sam before he left and I wasn't canceling it. He tried to shut it down right there. I. I told him I had a flight to catch for my brother's wedding and asked if he wanted to see the approval emails. The owner just looked exhausted. Then the owner asked the question that sealed everything. So who's trained to handle things while you're gone? I shrugged and said, Sam used to cover. I guess it'll be Rick now. Rick couldn't say a word. He had just spent 10 minutes calling my job easy. The next two weeks were chaos for him. The text asked for parts using names only I knew. The warehouse kid needed exact numbers. The manufacturer sites all required logins he didn't have. My binders and spreadsheets made sense only if you knew where everything lived. And every call to my work phone or desk forwarded straight To him, even the after hours line went directly to his cell and then his home phone if he ignored it. I spent 2 weeks on a beach while he tried to keep up. When I got back, he was waiting at the door ranting before I even set my bag down. It got loud. The whole staff came to watch. The owner had to step between us. I finally told him I was done dealing with this nonsense. The owner right in the eye and said, you saw how this place ran when I helped cover everything and you saw how it ran when he tried to do my job. So here's your choice. I'll clean out my desk tomorrow if he hasn't cleaned out his today. I left right after I came in the next morning, everyone was smiling. Rick's office was empty. The owner called me in and said I could get back to work. I said not unless I'm sitting in that office with his title and his pay. And that's how I finally got the promotion I'd earned years earlier.

I'm using this time to reassess my future. Good luck with Derek, she responded immediately. Wait, what do you mean? I didn't reply? I threw myself into work, hit the gym daily, reconnected with friends I'd neglected. I took the money I've been saving for our honeymoon and booked a solo trip to Japan. Life without her constant drama felt lighter. Four weeks into her break, my phone exploded at 2:00am, 37 missed calls, 23 texts ranging from, we need to talk to you, can't just ignore me, to I'm ready to come home. I responded the next morning, I'm not ignoring you. I'm respecting your need for space. How's Derek? That's over. It was a mistake. I choose you. I'm coming back. Coming back to what exactly? To us, to our life, to our engagement. I sent her a screenshot of the cancelled wedding plans. There is no engagement. You wanted a break to explore your options. I use that same time to explore mine. I choose myself. Her texts turned frantic. The ring I bought was apparently still on her finger. But Derek had dumped her after two weeks when she wouldn't stop comparing him to me. She'd been staying with her sister, too embarrassed to admit it hadn't worked out. Her friends had taken my side. Her parents had called her an idiot. Please, she begged. I made a mistake. You said you'd Wait, no, I corrected you. Said you'd come back if it didn't work out. I never agreed to be here when you did. Six months later, I'm still in my apartment, thriving in my career, genuinely happy. Jessica's engaged to someone new, rebounding hard. And her Instagram looks desperate. My Celebration party, I threw it last weekend with 200 friends celebrating my freedom. The venue coordinator who remembered me smiled when I explained.

There he was. Three forty seven PM on Tuesday while everyone else was out. He walked straight into my room, pulled open my dresser, moved things around until he found the box. He opened it, stared at the ring for a solid 10 seconds, then put it in his pocket and left. The whole thing took less than two minutes. I showed my brother the video. He went pale, called his wife in, called his son in. The kids stood there like nothing was wrong. My brother asked him where the ring was. It shrugged and said I left it by the TV in the guest room. Same exact excuse he used when he stole my 300 dollar watch last year. We found that watch two weeks later stuffed in his backpack behind the lining. They tore the guest room apart. Nothing. Checked his backpack, his clothes under the bed in the closet. My brother was sweating, his wife was crying and the kid just stood there with this blank expression. Day two, still nothing. I told my brother either the ring shows up or he pays me back the four 2 hundred dollars. He said they didn't have that kind of money right now. That's why they were staying with me in the first place. Asked for more time. I gave them until Sunday. Sunday came, no ring. My brother kept saying they'd looked everywhere, that maybe it got thrown out by Accident. Maybe I misplaced it myself. I showed him the camera footage again. He had nothing to say. Monday morning, while they were all out, I changed the locks. Took about 20 minutes. Then I packed all their stuff, clothes, toiletries, the kids toys, everything, and put it in boxes on the front porch. Left a note taped to the door, the ring's worth more than you are. Figure it out. My brother came back around 3 yours PM, started banging on the door, screaming that I couldn't do, do this, that I was putting a child on the street. I texted him through the door, your son stole 40 two hundred dollars from me and you did nothing. He can steal somewhere else now. He tried calling me 47 times that night. I blocked him. My mom called the next morning crying, saying I was tearing the family apart. I told her the same thing I told my brother. The kid's a thief and nobody wants to parent him. That's not my problem anymore. It's been five days. My girlfriend still doesn't know any of this happened. I was supposed to post next month on our anniversary trip. Now I don't even have a ring. Last night, my brother's wife texted from a motel asking if we could talk. I didn't respond. The ring's still gone and so are they.

I was seven months pregnant when it happened. We went to her house for Sunday dinner like we did every week, normal stuff. She made pot roast. My husband Greg was out back with his dad grilling corn. I needed to grab the folding chairs from her basement for extra seating. She followed me down saying she'd help. The stairs are steep and wooden. I remember holding the railing tight because my balance was off from the pregnancy. We got to the bottom and I bent down to grab a chair. That's when I felt both her hands on my back hard. I went flying forward and hit the concrete floor. The pain was instant. I was screaming and bleeding. She ran upstairs yelling for help. When Greg and his dad rushed down, she was crying, saying I tripped, that I've been drinking wine at dinner and she tried to catch me. I told them she pushed me, but she just kept saying I was confused from the fall. At the hospital, she told the same story to the doctors, even added that I smelled like alcohol. Greg didn't know what to believe. I was hysterical. They had to do an emergency C section. Daughter survived but spent two weeks in NICU. Here's the thing, his parents have a ring camera at the top of the basement stairs. I'd forgotten about it while I was recovering. I logged Into their account from my phone. The angle caught everything. Her looking around, following me down and both hands shoving my back. I showed Greg the footage in my hospital room. He just stared at the screen. Then he called his mom and told her she'd never meet our daughter. He tried saying the camera angle was wrong, but it was an accident. We filed a police report. She's facing charges now. Greg hasn't spoken to her since. Some bridges you just can't rebuild. The worst part wasn't even the physical pain. It was lying in that hospital bed, watching the nurses rush around me, feeling my body being prepped for surgery I wasn't ready for, and knowing that the person who did this to me was in the waiting room playing the concerned grandmother. She brought flowers. Can you believe that? Yellow roses, my favorite. She knew exactly what she was doing. I remember the anesthesiologist asking me to count backward from 10. I only made it to seven before everything went dark. When I. I woke up, Greg was holding my hand. His eyes were red and swollen. He told me our daughter was alive, but tiny, 3 pounds, 12 ounces. They taken her straight to the N, I, C, U. I couldn't even see her yet because I was too weak to move. His mom was standing in the corner of the recovery room, just standing there watching me. When I made eye contact with her, she. Smiled. It wasn't a warm smile. It was something else, something cold. She walked over and put her hand on my arm and said she was so glad the baby was okay that she'd been praying the whole time. I wanted to scream at her to rip her hand off me, but I was so drugged up and exhausted that I just turned my head away. Greg asked her to leave. She acted offended, said she was just trying to be supportive. Yeah.

So I kicked them out and now he can use his talents on the streets instead. The kids, 9 years old and has been stealing since he was 5. It started small candy bars from gas stations, toys from other kids at take care. My brother would always brush it off. He's just a kid. He doesn't understand property yet. By the time he was 7, target security had caught him twice. Both times they let him go because he's a minor. My brother actually laughed about it once at a family dinner like it was some cute quirk. I didn't think it was funny then and I definitely don't now. Last year, his school called my brother in because the kid had stolen three different phones from other students, backpacks, not borrowed. Holland hid them in his locker and denied everything until they checked cameras. My brother paid the family's back and promised to get him help. Never happened. No therapy, no consequences, nothing. A month ago, my brother showed up at my door with his wife and the kid. He'd lost his job at the warehouse and they were three weeks from eviction. He begged me to let them stay while he got back on his feet. He's doing Uber Eats now while applying to places, trying to save enough for a deposit on A new apartment. I said no at first, specifically because of his son. But my mom got involved, called me heartless and said, he's your brother. So I caved, told my brother straight up, your kid touches my stuff, you're all gone. He promised it wouldn't be an issue. Two weeks in, I caught the kid in my bedroom going through my closet. I told my brother to control his damn kid or I'd handle it myself. My brother got defensive, said I was being paranoid, that his son was just boring. After that, I bought one of those cheap $30 spy cameras off Amazon and hit it on my bookshelf. I've been saving for 14 months to buy my girlfriend an engagement ring. Every extra shift, every bit of overtime went into that fund. Ford Alley, $200 for a white gold band with a center diamond and smaller stones on the sides. It was perfect. I kept it hidden in a small box tucked under the bottom drawer of my dresser, wrapped in an old T-shirt. Nobody knew it was there except me. Last Tuesday, I came home from work around 6, I PM something felt off in my room, but I couldn't place it. Wednesday morning, I went to check on the ring before work. Just wanted to look at it. You know, the box was sitting on top of the drawer instead of under it. I opened it empty. My hands were.

Kurt was the new guy Audrey had been obsessing over since he moved here. And honestly, I get it. He had that cool guitar guy vibe going on that made him look like he was a missing member of one direction. And Audrey wasn't the only girl chasing after him.

My sister burst out laughing. I said nothing. That night, dad texted, don't bring that boy around us again. I replied, perfect. I'll pull my name off every Bill tonight. Ten minutes later, the family group chat went nuclear. My name is Dylan. I'm 38. For most of my adult life, I've been my family's invisible ATM. My son Andrew is 7. His mother died when he was 2. Since then, it's been us dad. I'd always loved my sister Haley more. Her college was paid in full while I worked nights. Her wedding had ice sculptures while mine had folding chairs. Her kids get birthday checks with three figures. Andrew gets cards that arrive late. The family home looks newer because I paid for the roof replacement when Dad's insurance lapsed, paid for the HVAC upgrade, the kitchen remodel when Haley decided Mom's countertops were too embarrassing for Instagram. At the last family dinner, Haley's youngest spilled juice and mom laughed it off. Andrew knocked over an empty bowl and dad made him apologize four times. Christmas dinner started the way it always did, too much noise, too little space for Andrew. The prime rib I bought sat center stage, $200 for people who barely acknowledged my son. Andrew asked quietly for mashed potatoes. Haley's oldest son, Henry put a massive spoonful and plopped it onto Andrew's shirt. Andrew froze. Henry Grinned. Clean it yourself, baby. Haley laughed, a full delighted laugh. Oh, my God, Henry, you're terrible. She didn't apologize. She just kept laughing. I cleaned him up. Nobody asked if he was okay. Andrew whispered, dad, can we go home? We stayed another hour. Andrew didn't eat when we left. I buckled Andrew in. He stared out the window with his thumb in his mouth. Seven years old and already learning some people don't love you the way they should. My phone buzzed at 9:47 p. M. Dad's text, don't bring that boy around us again. He makes everyone uncomfortable. That boy, not Andrew, that boy. Something inside me went cold. I opened the spreadsheet I've been maintaining for five years. Mortgage assistance, $18,000 dollars. Insurance, $4,200 annually. Car repair, $3,800. Haley's credit card debt, $6,500. Medical bills, $2,900. Kitchen remodel, $22,000. $140,000, money that could have been Andrew's college fund. I opened the family group chat. Perfect. I'll pull my name off every Bill tonight. The house, the cars, the accounts, all of it. Merry Christmas. I hit send, then turned off my phone. At 802:00am, the emails sent. I canceled the homeowner's insurance, the cell phone carrier. Six lines under my account. I downgraded to one. The other five would disconnect within 24 hours. Utilities, electric, gas, water.

At the funeral, my siblings swarmed me. Fake hugs, fake tears. My sister kept saying how we needed to together as a family now. I just nodded. I knew what was coming. But here's what broke me. During the service, people kept coming up to me with stories about my dad. His coworker told me how dad kept a photo of me on his desk, how he'd brag about my promotion at work. I didn't even know he knew about my promotion. I never told him because I thought he didn't care. My neighbor, this old woman I'd never met, grabbed my hand. She said dad talked about me every Sunday when he saw her at the grocery store. About how proud he was that I was making it on my own. How I reminded him of his own mother, strong and independent. I. I stood there crying, realizing my dad saw everything. He saw me being ignored at family dinners. He saw my siblings walk past me like I was furniture. He saw me stop coming to holidays because it hurt too much to be in a room full of people who acted like I was a stranger. And he never said anything to them. But he saw me. My sister noticed me crying and actually rolled her eyes, whispered to my brother. She's always so dramatic. Like I was performing grief instead of feeling it. Two weeks later, the lawyer called us in for the will reading. My brother and sister showed up in designer clothes, already arguing about who should get the house. My sister was on her phone looking up property values. My brother had literally brought a calculator. I sat in the corner in my work uniform, still wearing my name tag from my shift. I taken the bus there because my car was in the shop and I couldn't afford the repair yet. They didn't ask if I needed a ride. They didn't even ask how I was getting there. The lawyer asked if everyone was present. My sister didn't even look at me when she said yes. Then he started reading. Dad left everything to my siblings. The house, the cars, his savings, his investment accounts. They were smiling, nodding. My brother already texting someone. My sister was literally sketching kitchen renovation plans on her notepad. I felt sick, but also I felt nothing. Like, of course, of course this is how it would go. Then the lawyer said, however, there's a condition. The room went cold. My sister's pen stopped moving. Before they can access any inheritance, each sibling must tell one specific memory they have of spending time with their youngest sister. One genuine memory of time, Spent together. Just one.

This is exactly why a job that offers $300,000 for just six days of work still scares most people away. This is far from regular cleaning. They're taking a cargo hold that just carried coal and cleaning it so thoroughly it can safely transport food grade grain. The difficulty is basically like scrubbing an entire stadium with just a toothbrush. Look at this hold. It's eat like a bottomless pit. The ship can carry about 22 million pounds of cargo. To meet food safety standards, the crew uses high pressure water hose and washes every inch of the walls, ribs and beams. They can't reach a spot with the hose. They have to climb up and scrub it by hand. The rules are brutally strict. Not a single speck of coal can remain and even one drop of standing water on the floor will cause the inspection to fail. To ensure nothing is missed, inspectors even fly drones into the hole to check all the hidden corner that humans can't reach. But here's the crazy part. After working non stop for five or six days, most crews still fail the inspection. That's when the professional cleaning team steps in. With their experience and the right tools, they can get the whole certified in just one day. So what do you think? Is that $300,000 easy money or is it a paycheck? You Earn by risking your life.

The envelope sat on my counter for an hour before I could bring myself to open it. It was addressed from Dennis and I knew exactly who that was. When I finally opened it, there were four pages inside. He apologized for everything he did back then. I shoved you into lockers every morning. I spread rumors about you. Did you eat lunch alone for 2 years? I'm so sorry, he wrote. He said his dad used to beat him at home and that he took all that anger out on me instead. I've been in therapy for years now. I'm not that kid anymore. Can you ever forgive me? Part of me felt this weird sense of relief reading it, like maybe it really wasn't my fault after all. Then I noticed the return address printed at the bottom, cell Block d at a maximum security prison. I felt the room tilt slightly. I looked up the facility on my phone and it only housed violent offense there, serving 25 years to life. Dennis wasn't locked up for bullying kids in middle school. He'd done something serious and I had no idea what it was. I couldn't stop thinking about the letter for days. Finally, I wrote back telling him I forgave him and that his honesty meant a lot to me. It felt like I was finally letting go of something. I'd carried for 20 years. Two weeks later, Dennis wrote back, your forgiveness just lifted a weight I've been carrying since we were kids. Thank you so much. You have no idea what this means, his letter said. We started exchanging letters regularly after that. He told me about all these rehabilitation programs he'd completed in prison. I help younger guys in here now, one letter said. Help them break the cycle before it's too late. One letter even mentioned how he remembered my mom being sick back in 7th grade. I'm so sorry I made fun of you about that. That was cruel. How is she doing now? I actually cried reading that because it meant he really did care about making things right. My therapist thought the whole thing was incredibly healthy. Forgiveness is one of the most powerful things you can do, she told me. During one session, my best friend kept saying how brave I was. I could never do what you're doing. You're amazing, she said. After about four months, something shifted. I started feeling like I needed to see him face to face, face, even though part of me still wondered what he'd done. I scheduled a visit at the prison for Saturday morning. When I called my friend on Thursday night to tell her, she got really emotional. I'm so proud of you. You're turning something so painful into something beautiful, she said through tears. I felt really good about the whole thing. This was going to be the closure I needed. Saturday morning, I woke up early and drove two hours to the prison. The facility was massive and gray with layers of fencing around it. Inside the visiting room, I checked in with a guard at the desk. He looked at my ID and, and looked up at my face, then back down at his paperwork, then back at my face. His expression went strange. You here to see Dennis? I nodded. He kept staring at me. That's really strange. You look exactly like his victim. My entire body went cold. What? The guard seemed to realize he'd said too much. Just have a seat over there. I sat down at a table. My hands were shaking. My mind was racing. What did that guard mean? A door opened and Dennis walked in wearing an orange jumpsuit. When he saw me, his whole face lit up, but then immediately fell. He looked like he might cry. He sat down across from me slow.

What he didn't know was I've been working under a Michelin star chef for 8 months. Family dinner just got interesting. I was prepping vegetables in Chef Lauren's kitchen when my phone started buzzing. Once, twice, then non stop, 37 messages flooded the family group chat in under five minutes. Brother Kevin was getting engaged and apparently he had some entertaining stories to share about his failure of a sister. Yeah, Sophie tried the whole cooking school thing but couldn't hack it. Dropped out after a year. She's working at some greasy diner now flipping burgers or whatever, probably for the best. Honestly. Not everyone's cut out for real careers like mine. I nearly sliced my finger instead of the carrots. Messages kept rolling in. My cousin Hannah sent three crying, laughing emojis. My aunt Karen wrote, oh, honey, maybe you should look into administrative work. It's never too late to start over, my uncle commented. At least she's employed, I guess. And then my dad, the man who taught me how to scramble eggs when I was seven. Maybe it's time Sophie got serious about life instead of chasing unrealistic dreams. My hands were shaking, not from sadness, from pure rage. Here's what they didn't know. I hadn't been kicked out of culinary school. I left voluntarily eight months ago when chef Lauren Beaumont, owner of two Michelin stars and one of the most respected Kitchens in the city personally called me into his office after I catered a private event. He tasted my duck confit and offered me an apprenticeship on the spot. You don't say no to a man like that. You definitely don't say no to that kind of opportunity. But I never told my family. Kevin had just gotten his promotion to regional sales manager and I knew they'd never understand why I'd leave school. So I told them I was working at a diner and kept my head down, working 16 hour days in Laurent's kitchen, learning everything. Chef Laurent noticed me standing frozen, phone in hand. Problem, Sophie. I handed him my phone. Without a word, he read through the messages, his expression darkening with each swipe and something shifted. A slow smile spread across his face. Your family, they ever come to the restaurant? Never. They think I can barely afford to eat, let alone dine somewhere like this. He handed back my phone. Invite them Saturday night. Tell them you want to celebrate your brother's engagement properly. My treat, full tasting menu, Saturday evening arrived.

Excuse me, sir, I need you to gather your belongings. I looked up for my laptop. I'm sorry, we have an overbooking situation. You'll need to take a later flight. I have a confirmed ticket seat to a. I understand, but we need this seat. I pulled out my phone, showed her my boarding pass. Confirmed reservation, paid in full. I checked in online this morning, sir. Sometimes these situations happen. Not to confirm first class passengers. Her jaw tightened. You need to explain now. Other passengers were watching. The cabin went quiet. I'd like to speak to your supervisor, I said calmly. That won't be necessary. It absolutely is because I'm not moving until someone explains why a confirmed paid passenger is being removed. She forced a smile. Sir, if you don't comply, we'll have security remove you. Then call security and call your supervisor. I'll wait. Her smile vanished. She walked to the front, made a call. Two minutes later, a supervisor appeared. Older woman, professional. I'm Sandra. The in flight supervisor. What seems to be the Problem. Jennifer jumped in. This passenger is refusing to deplane after being informed of an overbooking situation. Sandra looked at me. Sir, may I see your ticket? I showed her my phone, boarding pass, confirmation number, receipt showing I paid $2,000 for this seat three weeks ago. Sandra's expression changed. This is a confirmed booking. I know, Jennifer said quickly, but we have a situation. What situation? First class isn't over booked. I checked the manifest this morning. Jennifer's face went red. There was a last minute issue. What issue? Silence. I leaned forward. I'd like to see the passenger manifest. I want to know who's taking my seat. That's confidential. Jennifer started. No, it's not. Sandra cut her off. Not when it involves removing a confirmed passenger. Sandra pulled out a tablet, scrolled through the manifest. Her face went from confused to angry in about three seconds. Jennifer step into the galley.

Put it down. Get to your knees. I immediately got down on my knees, tampons still in my shaking hand. Drop the weapon. Hands up. It's just a tampon, I screamed back trying to explain. Shaking like I was in an earthquake. I don't have anything. A week. The new AI. Run security cameras had been in place for a week. Principal Andrews had an assembly practically glowing with excitement and pride explaining how the cameras worked and how they'd be the latest in keeping our school safe. They'd be able to detect threats, alert the police immediately and in real time. We will be the first school in the state with these cameras and the safest, he'd promised. Now here I was face down, smelling the bleach of the linoleum floor with a knee in my back. I was put into handcuffs and yanked up. A female officer searched my pockets and any other possible hiding place. They found nothing. Then they dumped my purse and backpack, makeup, a couple of tampons, pencils, crumpled papers and my car keys clattered to the floor in a mess. Now more officers showed up, racing in with the s W. A. T. Team and tow keeping weapons on me. My locker was wrenched open with a man in full body gear like he was trying to diffuse a bomb. Where is it? The officer Holding my arm so tight I was going to bruise. Demanded in my face, what did you do with it? I've no idea what you're talking about. The cameras found a weapon. They don't lie. Then it's broken. I've not touched a weapon in my entire life. Mister Walker, my English teacher, joined the crowd that had formed around me. Be just tell them where it is. It'll be all over if you just follow orders. Mister Walker, you know me. I panic when they do fire drills. I wouldn't bring anything like that to school. Obviously, there's a first time for everything, Ruby. The system said you did, he said with remorse, like he couldn't believe I'd fallen so far. It saw something. Minutes later, my locker was emptied. Each item bagged and organized for testing and evidence. Each textbook, my gym clothes, even a spare change of clothes I kept for period emergencies, taken out and gone through. The crowd had grown larger, taking up the entire hallway. Students looking out of classroom doorways. Teachers had stopped class. Principal Andrews had even shown up. He started puffing out his chest and said solemnly, my dear, the system is state of art. It identified you holding a weapon at another student. Multiple viewpoints were reviewed and confirmed. Check it again, please. I was practically in tears as the officer holding me still didn't let me go. Maybe actually look at the videos. Ruby, we need you to tell us. Where the weapon is first, Principal Andrews insisted. Is it yours or someone else's? Maybe even your parents? For the thousandth time, I don't have a dang weapon, I screamed, crying so hard my eyes hurt. Mister Walker stepped forward. Ruby's a good student. Maybe she was framed. The system tracked her every second. She acted alone, the lead officer stated. They brought in the guidance counselor, the vice principal, even the librarian who I'd volunteered with every day after school to convince me to give up the act. All you're doing is making it worse on yourself, the lead officer said. Lying is a serious offense on top of everything

I whispered, save the one who didn't lie to me. My mother called me crying at 2:00am, said she needed emergency surgery. Her appendix, life or death. I rushed to the hospital in 20 minutes. When I got there, the nurse looked confused. Used your mother, sir, you already checked in a family member tonight. That's when my stomach dropped. Turns out my 15 year old son Jake was already there. Different floor. Motorcycle accident on his way home from a study group. Except Jake doesn't own a motorcycle. His study group ended at eight PM I called his friend's mom to confirm they'd left the library together. At 7:30, I found Jake in the er, conscious but banged up pretty bad. Road rash down his left arm, possible internal bleeding. His phone was shattered on the table next to him. Dad, I can explain, he started, but the tears came too fast. Where were you, I asked, trying to stay calm. I was just riding around the neighborhood. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. On what motorcycle, Jake? We don't have a motorcycle. He wouldn't answer. Just kept crying and saying sorry over and over. Then I got the call about my mother. Same hospital, two floors up, actually did need emergency surgery, appendicitis. That turned into a rupture. I spent the next hour running between floors. My son who'd Been lying to me. My mother who raised me. That's when the surgeon found me in the hallway. Doctor Chen looked exhausted. Mr Martinez, we have a serious problem. Both of them needed immediate surgery. Both had the same rare blood type, AB negative. The hospital only had enough units for one emergency procedure, major tonight. The nearest hospital with more AB negative is two hours away. Doctor Chen said we'd have to airlift it. Your mother's appendix could rupture completely. In that time. Your son's internal bleeding could get worse. So I have to choose. I'm sorry. Yes. I stood there frozen. What kind of choice is that, your mother or your son? My mother kept saying, choose me. I raised you. I gave you life. You owe me this. Jake just kept his eyes closed, wouldn't look at me. The tears rolling down his face. Then my mom's friend Carol showed up. I didn't even know she was in town. Oh, honey, this is terrible, Carol said, hugging my mom. First Vegas, now this. You can't catch a break. I looked at her. Vegas. Yeah. Last weekend was such a blast. Remember when we, my mother cut her off? Fast, Carol. Not now. But I was already processing it. Last weekend, my mother told me she was visiting her sister, Linda in Phoenix, has been sick, needed help around the house. I called Linda that Sunday to check in. She said mom hadn't visited in months. You were In Vegas, I asked my mother, we'll talk about this later, sweetheart. I'm about to have surgery. Something felt wrong, really wrong. I walked back down to Jake's room, started looking around. His backpack was in the corner. I unzipped it. Inside was a helmet, not his, way too big. And it had a name written inside in silver Sharpie, Barbara Martinez, my mother's name. I pulled up Jake's Instagram on my phone. Had to use my wife's account since he blocked me months ago. Scrolled back 3 hours, there it was, photo of Jake sitting on a motorcycle in a garage. I recognized my mother's garage, her motorcycle, her helmet on his head, big smile on his face. Caption, Grandma's the coolest, teaching me tricks today. Don't tell dad. The comments were all.

Now she's banned and deported. We hired Lauren two years ago when I went back to work at the pharmaceutical company after my second child was born. She had great references, CPR certified, spoke three languages. My. My husband Tom and I both worked demanding jobs. Needed someone reliable for our boys, ages 2 and 5. Lauren was perfect. Always on time, kept the house spotless, taught the kids basic French. I gave her bonuses regularly paid her vacation time, treated her like family. She ate dinner with us most nights at her own room in our house for when she stayed late. I even helped her get her green card sorted, wrote recommendation letters, paid for her continuing education courses and child development. That's why what happened next was such a betrayal. It started small. The mailman mentioned how nice missus Lauren was when I collected packages one Saturday. I corrected him. Said I was missus Walker. Lauren was our nanny. He looked confused, but didn't say anything else. Then the pool maintenance guy asked if the other lady needed him to show her how to check the chemicals. What other lady? He meant me. Said Lauren had introduced herself as the homeowner and told him I was the help. Still, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe there was a language misunderstanding. Lauren's English was perfect. But maybe she mispoke. Tom said I was being paranoid. But then our five year old Jake came home from the park upset. Said his friend Bradley's mom asked why, Mommy Lauren lets the Asian nanny pick him up from school sometimes. Jake was confused, told her I was his real mommy. Bradley's mom didn't believe him. Said Lauren had been very clear about being married to Tom for eight years. I confronted Lauren immediately. She broke down crying. Admitted she'd been telling everyone in the neighborhood she was Tom's wife because it was easier than explaining she was just the nanny. Said the neighbors were all white, wealthy, assumed any Asian woman with kids must be hired help anyway. So she just went along with their assumptions, but flipped the story. Made herself the wife to feel less inferior. Begged me not to fire her. She loved our boys, needed this job, promised to stop. I wanted to fire her instantly, but Tom convinced me to give her another chance. Boys loved her. Finding another nanny would take months. Against my better judgment, I agreed. One morning, that was three months ago last week, I left work early with a migraine. Parked down the street because contractors were blocking our driveway. Walked up to find Lauren hosting a neighborhood coffee morning in my living room. Six women from our street sitting on my couches, eating cookies from my kitchen. Lauren holding court, telling them about her vacation home in Colorado. Her husband's promotion. Her plans to renovate the kitchen. Then she saw me through the window. Her face went white. Told the women she needed to give the help instructions for dinner. Actually called me the help in my own home. I walked in through the front door. The women all stopped talking, stared at me like I was intruding. One actually asked if I could

And that's when I saw it. The joke pen from a book fair two years ago. Disappearing ink right now, gone tomorrow, the label screamed in bright, tacky letters, and I remembered buying it for three bucks thinking it would be funny for April Fool's or something. The pen looked completely normal otherwise, just a basic black ballpoint that could pass for any generic pen. I picked it up and something clicked in my brain. This wasn't just a forgotten gag gift anymore. This was justice. Spent 10 minutes carefully removing the label with acetone and a razor blade making sure no residue remained, then tested it on scrap paper to confirm the ink really did vanish after a day like the package claimed. The next morning, I held yesterday's test paper up to the window and smiled at the blank page that had been full of equations 12 hours ago, then tucked the trick pen into the front pocket of my bag, where I usually kept his daily donation. Sure enough, 8:00am, when we sat down, Bryce appeared beside my desk. Got a spare pen? He asked. I'm entitled. Tone as always. I handed over the prepared pen with the same defeated expression I perfected over months of this ritual. Legend, he said with that condescending smirk, pocketing it like I owe. During the exam, I positioned my paper at just the right angle where Bryce could see it clearly. From his teacher's sanctioned seat. And for the first time all year, I didn't bother shielding my answers with my arm. My heart was pounding as I worked through each problem methodically, taking my time with the calculations and making sure my handwriting was neat and readable, practically inviting him to copy every number and equation. Bryce took the bait beautifully, his pen moving in perfect synchronization with mine as he transcribed my answers. An hour of him furiously copying my work while I pretended not to notice. And when the exam ended, Bryce actually looked relieved, probably thinking he'd just secured another stolen pass, completely unaware that every answer he'd written was already fading into nothing. I watched him hand in his paper with a satisfied smile, and I had to bite my lip to keep from grinning. Results came in August, and the universe delivered. I passed and got into high school, while Bryce failed math with a completely blank paper. His dad spent hours at the school district office screaming about system errors, while Bryce swore he'd written every answer, but he never suspected the pen. He had to repeat eighth grade while I moved on to high school.

Couldn't assess how serious it was, so they quickly headed toward the nearest control tower. Flying low and slow, they hoped ground controllers would get a clear view. What they I saw was shocked. The nose gear was rotated 90 degrees, stuck sideways, perpendicular to the plane's body. A nightmare scenario unfolded, and the airport declared an emergency landing. But here's the issue. Landing like this would cause the plane to lose control immediately. Crash was practically certain. And there was more trouble. Fuel tanks were full, and the plane couldn't dump fuel midair. So the crew climbed higher, circling for over two hours, burning fuel and reducing weight. Then something bizarre happened. Passengers were watching live TV, and the screen was broadcasting their own news anchor. There's experts analyzing possible crash scenarios, discussing how this plane might the ground. In other word, the passengers were watching their own potential final moments live on air. Five minutes before landing, the cabin screens went black. The air. Brace for impact. Normally, in this kind of situation, the sideways nose gear would explode upon touchdown, leading to an instant disaster. The pilot used every bit of experience. He. He kept the rear wheels on the ground first, holding the nose up as long as he could. Only when the speed dropped low, Enough. Barely enough to support front gear. Did he allow the nose fall? The moment it touched the runway, spark blue smoke billowed and metal screamed across the tarmac. But somehow it worked. The plane slid to a stop. No fire, no collapse. All 146 people aboard survived without a single injury. It was a miracle landing. And the pilot? A hero the world will never forget.

I knocked on her door for 20 minutes but finally gave up when no one opened it. As I headed downstairs to the parking lot, I ran into her landlord. Where's Callie, I asked. He shrugged, left a few days ago, no warning. Then he continued on his way. My heart raced in my chest. She ghosted me and moved out without telling me something was very wrong. I drove to her parents house next and at with her older brother who is also a cop for the sheriff's department. Do you know where Callie is? I asked him. He shook his head with a frown. I haven't heard from her in weeks, he answered. She cut off the family. I shook my head. I think Leo cut her off, I replied. He's bad news. I saw bruises on her stomach the last time she was over at my place. We need to find her. Her brother immediately leaped into action and I was grateful he believed me. He pulled out his computer and started typing away, explaining to me as he typed, put a tracker on her phone a long time ago, but her number is disconnected, I protested. If she still has the phone, then I can still track her. He answered. He pulled up a map and there it was, a little beacon. He quickly called his partner at the police station and explained the situation. But I was already running From my car, I knew exactly where she was and I was running out of time. I drove way over the speed limit until I reached the bridge leading outside of town. Leo's car was smoking and pulled over on the side of the road. I spotted him towering over a screaming Callie and I was pissed. I leaped out of my car and tackled him to the ground. After seeing the bruises on Callie's face, I punched him over and over again until he was knocked out cold. Then I scooped Callie up into my arms and placed her in my car while she sobbed into my shoulder. She looked up with red eyes and sniffed. He was going to kill me, she whispered. He told me it was his plan all along. He's a serial killer and I fell for his trap. Then she dissolved into tears again and I was left feeling horrified that I almost lost my best friend forever.

My best friend Callie was the kind of person who made the world brighter. Her laughter was contagious and she was bright and bubbly. She always had a smile on her face and could brighten everyone's day. I loved her like a sister and have been best friends with her for 10 years. I thought for sure we would be best friends for life. But then she met Leo. Leo was her opposite in every way. His face was hard and cold. His rip was tight. Whenever he was holding her hand or arm, he was stern and forceful. I didn't like him as soon as I met him. He gave me a bad vibe instantly. But Callie was in love with him, so there was nothing I could do if I wanted to stay in Callie's life. I noticed things started getting a little weird as they started dating. At first it was little things. Callie started withdrawing into herself. She wouldn't smile as much anymore. There were dark circles under her eyes. She wouldn't call me as often anymore. And when I tried calling her, Leo would answer her phone and tell me she was busy before hanging up. She stopped going to family dinners at her parents'house. And her mom called me one day to ask if I'd heard from Callie. Apparently, she stopped talking to them all together, which was weird, cause She was very close to her parents and older brother. She wouldn't just cut them off randomly. One day when she was over at my place after a week of no contact, I caught her rubbing a hand over her stomach, wincing in pain. She caught me looking and immediately dropped her hand, brushing off my concern. But when she bent over to put on her shoes before she left, her shirt rode up and I saw the bruises. What are those? I asked sharply. She stood up, startled before her eyes hardened. Nothing, she snapped. I was shocked at her tone. She's never snapped at me before. I didn't have time to respond before she was jogging out the front door to Leo's car. I watched them drive away, thinking I made a terrible mistake letting her go back to him. I had to do something to help her. I called her the next day, but she didn't answer her phone. I tried calling her every day that week, but finally her phone said her number had been disconnected. When her phone said that, I froze, my blood growing cold. I immediately hopped into my

I had my daughter when I was 16, which means every mom at the playground treats me like I'm playing house with a real baby. Not exaggerating. Yesterday, another mom named Dorothy literally took my daughter snack bag out of my hands to check if everything was cut small enough while explaining that grapes are choking hazards. Like I haven't been keeping this kid alive for eight years. The playground moms have this unspoken hierarchy and teen moms sit somewhere below first time mom who read one parenting book, but slightly above dad who's babysitting. They cluster together on the benches, designer diaper bags arranged like fortifications, watching me through their oversized sunglasses and whispering loud enough for me to hear. Poor thing probably doesn't even know about developmental milestones. Sandra, another mom, said that last week while I was helping my daughter on the monkey bars. Then Maggie chimed in. Do you even know about the car seat regulations? Someone should really check. They've appointed themselves my unsolicited parenting board of directors, swooping in to correct my every move like I'm a child raising a child. My daughter Poppy, her nickname, is 8, thriving, reading two grades above level and can name every bone in the human body because I taught her. But sure, please tell me more about how I'm holding the sandwich wrong. Last Saturday, we were all at Poppy's Elementary. Spring Festival when something went down that should probably be recorded in the history books. I was helping Poppy get her face painted when Dorothy marched over and saw the juice box in Poppy's hand. You're giving her sugar before noon. Blasphemous. She literally snatched it from my 8 year old. I snatched it right back. She just played soccer for two hours, Dorothy. She needs it. Dorothy turned to the growing crowd of parents. This is exactly what I mean about teen mothers. They have no concept of nutrition. She. I tried to grab it again, but I held it out of reach. I literally teach nutrition classes at the hospital. The hospital cafeteria isn't a classroom, sweetie. Maggie interrupted and everyone laughed. Then she noticed Poppy's Band Aid and whipped out her phone. Is this from home? Does she get hurt often? She started photographing Poppy's knee while asking her if Mommy ever loses her temper. I pushed Maggie's phone down. Stop interrogating my daughter over a soccer scrape. Sandra gasped. So defensive.

We found out I was pregnant in September. My husband Jake and I were so excited we told both our families the same day. His sister Danny was dating some guy she'd met through a family friend and got engaged in October after knowing him for three months. My in laws were thrilled because Danny had been complaining about wanting to get married for five years straight. At the engagement party, Danny mentioned she wanted the wedding by April 2,025. Jake told his parents right there that my doctor said I couldn't travel after 34 weeks. His mom just nodded and changed the subject. They picked April 19th anyway. The wedding would be in Texas where Danny's fiance lived. That's a three and a half hour flight from US. I told Jake in February that I'd be 37 weeks pregnant by then and couldn't go. His mom called him and said it was fine if I stayed home, but he had to come. I actually said okay at first because I figured it would be fine. Then we had an OB appointment two weeks ago. I asked the doctor directly if Jake could travel during my 37th week. She looked at both of us and said absolutely not. She said it would be like rolling dice and if I went into labor, she couldn't stop it. Jake agreed right there that it was messed up. They picked that date knowing we probably Couldn't make it. Last week, Jake told his mom we both weren't coming. She lost it. His dad called and said if Jake didn't show up, then he wouldn't go either. Like that was supposed to guilt us into changing our minds. Looked at me after the call and asked if maybe he could just go for the ceremony and fly back the same day. I said no. He asked if his parents could stay with me while he went. I said no again. He tried saying his sister would never forgive him. I reminded him that Danny knew my due date when she picked April 19th, she knew I'd be two weeks away from giving birth. His whole family knew. They just didn't care. His mom started texting me directly. She said I was being selfish and controlling. She said Danny only gets one wedding day and we could have more kids. I didn't even respond to that. Jake's dad called him again and said he was choosing me over his own sister. Jake told him he was choosing his child, his actual child that was about to be born. Annie sent me a long message saying I was ruining her special day and that I was keeping her brother from her on purpose. She said if something happened to me during labor, that Jake's parents could just drive me to the hospital. We live 40 minutes from the hospital. She really thought that was a solid plan. The wedding. Was yesterday. Jake stayed home with me. His parents went but didn't talk to us the whole week before. Danny posted pictures all day and Jake's whole family was in them. His mom posted a photo with just Danny, captioned, my only child who showed up. Jake's phone blew up from his cousins asking why he wasn't there. His aunt called him a bad brother. His uncle said he was whipped. Nobody cared that I could literally go into labor at any moment. Jake turned off his phone after.

Then she begged me to help deliver her baby. I planned Chris's surprise party for weeks, 20 friends hiding at his apartment, cake ordered that expensive whiskey he mentioned once. I needed to drop my work bag at home first and change into the dress he loved. Walking upstairs, I heard something from my old room, my childhood bedroom. I kept exactly how it was with my old stuffed animals organised on the bed. The closer I got, the more I heard my old bed creaking and weird moan noises. And that's when I saw them. My sister Aria's black hair spread across my pillow. Chris's hand on her hip. My freaking squishmallows had fallen off the bed face down on the floor like they couldn't watch either. Aria looked at me and shrugged. We were going to tell you after his birthday. Chris covered himself with my pillow, the one I'd cried into when dad died. This isn't what it looks like. But Aria laughed. It is exactly what it looks like. I stood there holding his birthday gift. Her overnight bag was by my desk. Trash and water bottles everywhere. They've been using my room for weeks. I blocked them both and drove straight to my friend's couch in Boston. Didn't even pack properly. Just threw stuff in garbage bags and left. Party guests kept texting, asking where I was. Chris's mom called me crying, saying she'd pay Me to come back into his life. I let Chris's brother explain why his surprise was cancelled. Three months later, I was enrolled in nursing school, something I'd always wanted but put off for Chris's career. My professor said I was a natural, steady hands, calm under pressure. Turns out watching your world explode makes hospital chaos feel manageable. I moved into my own apartment, Learned to cook for one, and basically lived in the hospital. That's where I met David. He was a pediatric surgeon who kept passing me at the same spot every day until finally he stopped and said, either you're stalking me or we should get coffee. He didn't love bomb me like Chris had. He just showed up consistently, morning runs, weekend study sessions, gave me caffeine during clinical rotations. When he met my parents, mom actually smiled. She hadn't smiled at Chris once in three years. Meanwhile, I heard through mom that Aria and Chris were serious now. She moved into his apartment. They got engaged at the same restaurant where Chris and I had our first date, which felt intentionally cruel. Mom sent me photos I didn't ask for. Aria in a white dress at their engagement party. Her wearing the exact dress I'd shown Chris I wanted for mine. Chris's hand on her stomach, pregnant already. She's having a hard time, mom would say during our monthly calls. Chris is not adjusting well to the pregnancy. I didn't ask for details. I Was busy, graduated top of my nursing class, moved in with David, who proposed with his grandmother's ring. My life was finally mine. We were tasting wedding cakes when mom called. Her voice was shaking. Your sister's in labour. She's alone at the hospital. Where's Chris? He's been cheating since she started showing. She found him with their neighbour. I'm in Paris for a work conference and I can't get back for 12 hours. I sat down, my fork. David watched my face change. The nurses called me because mom paused. You're still her emergency contact. She never changed it. She's been asking for you, the nurses said. She keeps saying her sister is coming. I sighed. She doesn't have a sister anymore. Mom started crying. He was terrible the whole pregnancy. Stayed out all night, charged motel rooms to their shared card and brought other women to her prenatal appointments. She.

But Dad's secret holder proved every single lie. Every family gathering, he'd find a way to bring up how I failed him as a sister. Remember when you didn't come to my baseball game in third grade? That's when I knew you didn't care about me. Never mind that I was 6 years old and had the flu. Remember when you told mom I broke her vase? You were always trying to get me in trouble. Never mind that he did break the vase, and I was trying to help him clean it up. Keith had rewritten our entire childhood to make himself the victim and me the villain. And our parents bought every word. He'd tell people. I bullied him growing up, even though he was four years older and twice my size. He'd say I sabotaged his relationships, when really his girlfriends left because he was unbearable. He'd claim I turned our parents against him, when actually they were exhausted by his constant complaints about me. Every achievement I had, Keith would diminish by explaining how it hurt him when I got into nursing school. He said I only chose that career to make him look bad, since he dropped out of college. When I got married, he said I planned my wedding to overshadow his birthday, which was three months later. When I had my first child, He said I got pregnant to steal attention from his promotion at work. Everything I did was somehow an attack on key. The worst part was how he performed this victim act in public. At restaurants, he'd loudly say things like, I forgive you for being such a terrible sister, even though it scarred me for life. People would stare and assume I'd done something horrible. At family reunions, he'd give speeches about overcoming the trauma of having an abusive sibling while looking directly at me. On social media, he'd post quotes about surviving toxic family members, and everyone knew he meant me. Our parents tried to stay neutral, but Keith wore them down. He'd call them, crying about how I'd hurt him again by existing in his vicinity. He threatened to cut them off if they didn't acknowledge how badly I treated him. He convinced them that all his problems stemmed from growing up with such a selfish sister. They started asking me to be more considerate of Keith's feelings, which meant basically disappearing from family events so he couldn't enjoy them. I started keeping my distance, but Keith would seek me out just to tell me I was failing as a sister by not being around. When I showed up, he'd say I was intruding on his family time. When I stayed away, he'd say I was abandoning the family. There was no way to win, because Keith needed me to be the villain in his story. Without Me to blame. He'd have to face his own failures, and that was never going to happen. Things escalated when our dad got diagnosed with cancer. Keith immediately took control, saying he'd handle everything because I was too incompetent to help. He told the doctors I wasn't involved in dad's care. He scheduled treatments when he knew I couldn't, and then told dad I didn't care enough to show up. He blocked me from the family group chat about Dad's condition, claiming I just caused drama. But here's what Keith didn't know. Dad had been keeping his own records. Every time Keith claimed I hadn't visited, dad wrote down that Keith had told me not to come. Every time Keith said I didn't help with medical bills, dad noted that Keith had refused my money every time. Keith portrayed himself as the devoted son doing everything alone. Dad documented what

He called me a disappointment in front of everyone. So I took them back. My dad's a lifelong Lakers fan. Growing up, he'd sneak a radio into his bedroom to listen to the finals. He used to say courtside seats were a dream only real men could achieve. If men with real jobs, real success. I wasn't that man. Not in his eyes, anyway. Three years ago, I was eating ramen five nights a week, crashing on a mattress in a moldy apartment above a barbershop. I dropped out of college after panic attacks made me fail three classes in a row. My dad's response? You always quit too soon. You never finish anything. My brother Todd. Finance degree, hedge fund internship, wedding in Tuscany. Me, the dropout, the disappointment. The family punchline. When I started my own consulting business, I didn't even tell him. What was the point? Point? I already knew what he'd say. You a CEO? Of what? A lemonade stand? But I kept grinding. Every freelance gig I could find worked through burnout, through doubt, through nights. I wanted to quit. And slowly, painfully, it started working. One client became two. Two became 10. A viral post brought in companies I'd only dreamed of. Suddenly I had money. A new car, a better apartment. And that's when they noticed me again. My dad's first compliment in years. Looks Like you finally figured out how not to screw everything up. He laughed like it was a joke. I paid off their mortgage last year. Quietly wired the money, told mom to check the balance. I cried. My dad said, that's the least you could do after all we've put into you. Put into me? You mean the years of calling me Laptop Larry at Family BBQs? The constant reminders that I wasn't a real man with a real job? But I kept trying. Some stupid part of me still wanted him to be proud. That's why I bought those Lakers tickets. $8,000 courtside, for his 60th birthday. Because I remembered those old photos of him in his high school Jersey. Because despite everything, I thought maybe this would be the moment. Maybe this time he'd look at me the way he looked at Todd. I drove six hours straight. Didn't even stop for coffee. Rehearse the surprise 100 times in my head. How I'd walk in, hand him the gold foiled envelope, watch his face light up. Dinner started perfect. Just close family. His favorite steak, a small cake. I gave him the tickets before dessert, slid the envelope across the table. He opened it slowly, eyebrows furrowing, then shooting up in disbelief. No way, he muttered. I smiled. Courtside, he said louder, showing everyone like they were metals. The room buzzed. My uncle clapped my back. My cousin asked, are these real? Mom looked genuinely surprised. The first Time in years I saw a real smile on my dad's face. Then came the toast. He raised his glass, tickets still in his other hand, grinning wide to my son. Still a disappointment, but hey, at least he's rich now. The laughter that followed was loud, cold. My cousin snorted wine through his nose. People were doubled over. Then my Uncle Tom leaned in, just loud enough for me to hear. Luxury gifts don't make up for being a loser. Something inside me froze. I looked.

This time my stomach dropped. No one knew the results of that test but me. I was eight months pregnant with our second when my husband's family threw us a surprise dinner at their house. The dining room was decorated with blue and pink balloons. His sister Morgan kept refilling my water while everyone laughed about baby names and made predictions. And Brandon made that joke about C sections. The room kept buzzing with conversation, but everything went silent in my head. I set down my glass carefully. I smiled. Actually vaginal this time. Doctor cleared me last week. Brandon's face drained of color. Wait, what? I thought? The table went quiet. My husband squeezed my hand under the table, clearly confused about why this mattered. Brandon, his wife Melissa, hissed, ripping his arm. My mind was racing. My first pregnancy ended in an emergency C section after 31 hours of labor. It was traumatic. I hemorrhaged and two days in intensive care while my Newborn was in the NICU. Only 4 people knew the full details, me, my husband, my OB and the hospital staff. We'd kept most of it private because his family had opinions about everything. They'd already criticized my birth plan, my hospital choice, even my decision to get an epidural. I never told them about the complications. Neither did my husband. So how did Brandon know I'd had a C section? I Pulled out my phone, slowly opened my medical portal app, the one that's linked to my husband's insurance. So he has shared access to view bills and appointments. Babe, I said, keeping my voice steady. When did you last check your email? The one connected to the insurance portal. He looked at me confused this morning. Why? I navigated to the settings, clicked on Shared Access and there it was. I turned the screen toward him. Shared access notification added user Brandon dot Harris at techcorp dot com. Access granted May 3rd, Three months ago. My husband stared at the screen. What the hell? Brandon stood up, asked his chair scraping. Look, I can explain. You've been reading my wife's medical records. My husband's voice was deadly quiet. It's not like that. Then what is it like? I asked. My hands were shaking. Because you just knew details about my first delivery that we never told anyone. And now I'm looking at proof. You've had access to every test result, every ultrasound note, every doctor's message for the past three months. Morgan, his sister, suddenly found her wine glass fascinating. Their mother adjusted her napkin. Their father cleared his throat and stood up. Maybe we should sit down, dad, my husband said. Melissa started crying. I told you to stop. I told you this was wrong. Stop what, I demanded. She covered her face with her hands. The bet, they have a bet going. The whole family. The whole family. I. Looked around the table. His mother wouldn't meet my eyes. His father was staring at his plate. Morgan was texting someone under the table. Even his grandmother in the corner looked guilty. What bet, my husband said. Brandon sank back into his chair. It started as a joke. Just boy or girl, you know, everyone does that. Everyone doesn't hack into medical portals. I said, I didn't hack anything. You gave me the login months ago when I needed to check my own stuff for that physical. He looked.

We found out I was pregnant in September. My husband Jake and I were so excited we told both our families the same day. His sister Danny was dating some guy she'd met through a family friend and got engaged in October after knowing him for three months. My in laws were thrilled because Danny had been complaining about wanting to get married for five years straight. At the engagement party, Danny mentioned she wanted the wedding by April 2,025. Jake told his parents right there that my doctor said I couldn't travel after 34 weeks. His mom just nodded and changed the subject. They picked April 19th anyway. The wedding would be in Texas where Danny's fiance lived. That's a three and a half hour flight from US. I told Jake in February that I'd be 37 weeks pregnant by then and couldn't go. His mom called him and said it was fine if I stayed home, but he had to come. I actually said okay at first because I figured it would be fine. Then we had an OB appointment two weeks ago. I asked the doctor directly if Jake could travel during my 37th week. She looked at both of us and said absolutely not. She said it would be like rolling dice and if I went into labor, she couldn't stop it. Jake agreed right there that it was messed up. They picked that date knowing we probably Couldn't make it. Last week, Jake told his mom we both weren't coming. She lost it. His dad called and said if Jake didn't show up, then he wouldn't go either. Like that was supposed to guilt us into changing our minds. Looked at me after the call and asked if maybe he could just go for the ceremony and fly back the same day. I said no. He asked if his parents could stay with me while he went. I said no again. He tried saying his sister would never forgive him. I reminded him that Danny knew my due date when she picked April 19th, she knew I'd be two weeks away from giving birth. His whole family knew. They just didn't care. His mom started texting me directly. She said I was being selfish and controlling. She said Danny only gets one wedding day and we could have more kids. I didn't even respond to that. Jake's dad called him again and said he was choosing me over his own sister. Jake told him he was choosing his child, his actual child that was about to be born. Danny sent me a long message saying I was ruining her special day.

I'm 16 and I live with my mom during the week. Every Saturday I go see my dad at his place. But last Saturday, he texted me to meet at this cafe downtown instead. That was weird already because we always hang out at his house. When we sat down, I ordered an iced latte. Dad made this snorting sound and grinned at me. I asked him what was so funny. He leaned back in his chair and said he pulled a prank on my stepmom. That's when I knew something stupid happened. Dad loves pranks, always has. When I was younger, he'd play videos of cats screaming on his phone just to watch our cat freak out. He'd play dog barking sounds, too. The cat would run around the house looking for the other animals. Dad thought it was hilarious every time. He also used to flip the light switch off when I was in the bathroom. I'd be standing there in complete darkness yelling at him to turn it back on. He'd wait like 30 seconds before flipping it back. Did it at least 10 times over the years. The worst one was with my mom. This was before they divorced. Dad found this fake rubber snake at a dollar store. He knew mom was terrified of snakes since she was a kid. One night he put it right next to her pillow while she was Sleeping. She woke up and saw it in the dark, started screaming so loud. I heard it from my room downstairs. Dad was laughing in the hallway. Mom didn't talk to him for three days after that. So when he said he pranked my stepmom, I already knew it wasn't going to be good. I asked him what he did. He started smiling and said he made her a latte that morning. She's vegan and only drinks oat milk. He knows this. She's told him 100 times. But he made her latte with whole milk instead, regular cow milk. He wanted to see if she could tell the difference. She drank half of it before she asked him if he used the right milk. He started laughing and told her what he did. She got really mad, started yelling at him about how he knows she doesn't consume animal products, how it's not just a preference but something she cares about. He kept saying it was just a joke.

My neighbor Linda has lived next door for like 8 years. We were never super close, but we chat over the fence sometimes about normal stuff like the weather or when trash day was. Her son Ryan was in the police academy training to be a cop. She was always bragging about him, showing me pictures of him in his uniform and talking about how proud she was. He seemed like a normal guy whenever I saw him visiting last month, I noticed Linda wasn't outside as much. When I did see her, she looked terrible, like she hadn't slept in weeks. I finally asked if everything was okay and she just started crying right there in her driveway. She told me Ryan got arrested and was in prison. I asked what happened and she said it was all a huge misunderstanding. Apparently during his police training he had to do some kind of internship at a juvenile detention center. One of the inmates there was a 13 year old girl. Linda told me the girl took off all her clothes to seduce Ryan and they ended up having sex. She said someone found out and now Ryan was doing 25 years in prison with no chance of getting out early. I stood there not knowing what to say because that sounded absolutely horrific. Then Linda said the Part that made my blood boil. She said it wasn't Ryan's fault because the girl enticed him and men can't control themselves when that happens. I felt my whole body tense up. I told her that was complete garbage. Ryan was the adult in that situation. He was supposed to be training to protect people, not abuse children. She got defensive and said I didn't understand how men work. She actually said men can't control themselves when women try to seduce them, even if it's a child. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I told her that if men can't control themselves around a naked 13 year old, then they're nothing more than animals and definitely shouldn't be cops or around kids at all. Linda's face turned red and she said I was being cruel.

I was fighting a bogus parking ticket. The officer claimed I blocked a hydrant that didn't exist on that street. The courthouse was chaos. A woman sobbed as officers LED her husband away in handcuffs. A lawyer shouted into his phone about evidence that had mystery seriously disappeared. My case was hours away when coffee suddenly drenched my lap. I'm so sorry. A man in a wrinkled suit stood over me, empty cup in hand. His eyes were bloodshot. Tie a skew. Before I could respond, he collapsed beside me, hands shaking violently. Last chance gone, he whispered more to himself than me. My phone buzzed, my boss's third warning, back by noon or clean out your desk. Perfect. The clerk called out. Johnson. We both stood up. Same last name, Michael Johnson, Family Court. That's me, he said. Voice breaking. Judge Harris had an emergency. Your case is at three PM courtroom B. His phone rang immediately. His face fell further. My lawyer just quit, says there's no way to win. I checked the time. My hearing wasn't for two hours and I was already fired anyway. I'll help you, I said. Not a lawyer, but I know when something smells wrong. In courtroom B, his ex wife sat with her attorney, both smirking. A security guard blocked my path. Court personnel only. Michael grabbed my arm. He's my legal consultant. The guard's eyes narrowed but He stepped aside as proceedings began. A stern faced woman slipped into the seat behind us. Watching intently, Michael's ex portrayed him as a dangerous man with violent tendencies. Her lawyer presented medical records showing psychiatric holds, police reports about threats. The judge's face darkened. Michael's hands trembled. Mysterious woman behind us suddenly passed me a note, page 3, admission date. I flipped to the medical report. New Harbor Medical Center, September 15th. Something clicked in my mind. The courtroom doors burst open. A woman in scrubs rushed in, whispering urgently to the bailiff. The judge called a recess. During the break, I googled New Harbor Medical Center. It had been condemned last February after a ceiling collapse. Court resumed. I stood up, heart racing. Your honor, may I.

Just to annoy them? My dad had one rule that he was absolutely obsessed with. Be home by 10 p m. Sharp. Not 10:01, not 10:05. Exactly 10. He would literally stand at the front door with his watch waiting like some kind of security. Security guard. If I was even one minute late, I lost my car keys for an entire week. No exceptions, no excuses, no appeal process. So at 16, I decided if he wanted me home by 10, I would be home by 10. Young, I was going to make it as disruptive and annoying as humanly possible. It started simple. First night I pulled into our driveway at exactly nine fifty nine PM and honked my horn three times. Long, loud honks that definitely woke up our neighbors. Then I got out, walked to the front door and rang the doorbell like I was a guest. When dad opened it, looking confused, I stood at attention, saluted him, and announced, reporting for duty, sir. Arriving with precisely 60 seconds to spare as per household regulations. He just stared at me like I had lost my mind. What are you doing? Following your rules, I said with the straightest face possible. You said be home by 10. I'm home by 10. The next night I took it further. I came home at 9:59 again. But this time I brought my friend Mike with me. Both marched up to the front door, and I announced loudly, witness present to confirm timely arrival. Mike held up his phone showing 9:59 p m. And nodded solemnly, like he was testing flying in court. My dad just shook his head and walked away without saying a word. My mom was laughing in the kitchen. By night three, I had created an entire system. I started taking a photo of our front porch with my phone, making sure the time stamp was visible at 9:59 p m. Then I would print it out at school the next day and hand it to my dad at dinner like it was some kind of official report. Photographic evidence of compliance, I would say. Sliding the paper across the table, he would crumple it up and throw it away without even looking at me. My mom thought the whole thing was absolutely hilarious. She would try to hide her smile behind her coffee mug. My dad was not amused at all. He kept muttering about how I was being ridiculous. But he could not actually punish me because technically, I was following his rule perfectly. Then I took it to the next level. I went to a thrift store and bought an actual time clock. You know, the kind with the cards that you punch in at factory jobs. It cost me $8. I installed it right next to our front door with double sided tape. Every single night at 9:59 p M. I would walk in, ceremoniously punch my time card with a loud kick chunk sound, and file it in a little folder I labeled Attendance Records. Autumn 2023. My dad walked past it one night and just stopped. He stood there staring at this time clock mounted on our wall, like it had personally offended him. Do you really need to do this? He asked, his voice tight. I looked him dead in the eye. Just following the rules, dad. You always said punctuality builds character. My mom was losing it. She was laughing so hard, she had tears in her eyes. This went on for two weeks. 14 nights of me punching in at 9:59 p m. Like I was clocking in for a shift. I even start

So I've had a sugar daddy for about a year. I know how it sounds, but I was drowning in student loans and bills. While serving at Applebee's, my friend would tell me about her sugar daddy and was like, he has a friend named Owen who's looking for something super casual. I was skeptical, but I started texting him and honestly, he was chill. Paid off my credit cards the first month, covered my rent and never pushed for anything weird. Just someone to text about his thoughts when his job stressed him out. Easy money. But then last week, my mom calls me crying, begging me to come to my Aunt Martha's wedding. I haven't talked to that side of the family in three years since they called my mom a gold digger during the divorce. But whatever. It's one day I can fake nice. I show up to the rehearsal dinner at this nice venue, walk into the private room, and then the complete unexpected. I see my baby daddy, Owen, in a tux holding my aunt's hand. My actual sugar daddy is marrying my aunt. He sees me and his face goes white. I literally cannot move. My mom's asking why I look sick and he's just staring at me. He corners me by the bathroom and I'm trying to explain that we need to stop this, that I can't do this with my aunt even if I don't like her, but he cuts me off. Your mom thinks you're working extra shifts at Applebee's, right? Want me to tell her about your real income? Then he transfers me $9,000 while I'm standing there and goes, that's triple. Just get through this weekend. The wedding was the next day. I sat in the back row trying to be invisible. But during the vows, when he said forsaking all others, he looked directly at me. My aunt was crying about God's plan and he's making eye contact with me. After the ceremony, while my aunt was taking pictures, he texted me, you looked beautiful today. That dress is nice. Is, is it new? I wanted to puke. I didn't respond. At the reception, my aunt made this huge speech about waiting for the right man, how she'd been cleansed after her first divorce and how Owen proved that good Christian men still exist in speech. He texts me, I wish you were in her place. I got up to leave and my mom grabbed my arm, asking where I was going. Three days later, there's a family brunch after church. He sits directly across from me. My aunt's showing pictures of beaches while he's playing footsie with me under the table. I move my legs uncomfortably and he texts, don't be rude. My cousin asks why I look pale. Owen goes, you should eat something, and puts food on my plate. His hand lingering on my shoulder. My Aunt thinks it's sweet. A week later, my mom tells me Aunt Martha invited us to dinner to celebrate their one week anniversary. I try to get out of it, but my mom says Martha specifically requested me because Owen thinks you're such a good influence on their daughter, Ava. Ava, who's 16 and wears a purity ring. He answers the door while Martha's cooking, pulls me into a hug that lasts way too long and whispers, I've missed you. Here's the thing. Our arrangement was never supposed to be physical, ever. He wanted someone to talk, to, send good morning messages, someone who'd listen to him complain about work. That was the whole deal. Then during dinner, I get up to use the bathroom. He follows me down the hall, pushes me against the wall under their family portrait and says, I know you want this, too. Stop pretending.

I found my work crush share crying in the break room looking completely stressed. My dad's in the hospital and I need to fly out tonight, but I can't find anyone to watch my kids. My ex won't answer. The babysitter I hired bailed. And I just, I can't afford to miss this flight, but I can't afford anything else either. She leaned against my shoulder crying even harder. I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said. Heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids, 3 for at least two weeks. I waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest around 14 looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work. Camilla, the middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, Kevin, wouldn't even look at me. They stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Cher hug them quickly, told them to be good and left for the airport. I stood there with three kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. The first morning I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed, she's not here, you know, you can stop trying, she said. Besides, you're Not her type. Mom doesn't date guys without kids. We've seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Shares, co workers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps, everyone wanted to play dad until they realized three kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. Spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings. They hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive two weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy, be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Sometime within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Just leave me alone, he said. Turning away. I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get mad at you or do anything without your permission, not even tell your mom, but I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't have a dad. I Added his head and thanked him, walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. The next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rental GTR, strikingly white engine purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now, I said loudly as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop and quickly he hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said. I picked up the other two kids and took them to in and out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a helmet full of nachos and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. Not bad, old man, Camilla said, watching her siblings enjoy the game, we made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard, I and everything to their mom with a caption, we wish you were here. After that, things between me and the kids sort of changed. When the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom, I sat beside her bed reading out fairy Tales until she fell asleep. I made the kids meals and lunch box.

My brother Nathan and I used to be super close. Like, we talked every day, hung out at least twice a week, and he was the first person I called when anything happened. We'd grab burgers on Thursdays after his shift, play video games until 2:00am on weekends, and we were literally each other's emergency contact. When our parents died in a car crash three years ago, we only had each other. We got through it together. I thought nothing could ever change that. Then he met Ivy at some work conference. Within two months, they were engaged. I was happy for him, honestly. I threw him a bachelor party, helped him pick out his suit, and gave a speech at the wedding. Sure, Ivy was kind of cold to me and barely said two words whenever we hung out, but I figured she was just shy or whatever. The problem started maybe a month after the wedding. Nathan canceled our Thursday burger runs three weeks in a row. Then he stopped answering my calls. When I texted asking if everything was okay, he'd reply with one word answers or leave me on read. I tried not to take it personally. I knew newlyweds needed space. But then my car broke down on a Tuesday morning. I was stranded in a grocery store parking lot in 90 degree heat. Nathan lived 10 minutes away. I called Him, and he actually picked up. Hey, man, I need help. My car died and I'm stuck at the store on Fifth Street.

We were at the engagement party when the bride's aunt offered me champagne. I smiled and said no thanks, I don't drink. She went completely still. Her face turned pale. Then she stood up so fast her chair scraped backward. This marriage is invalid, she announced loudly to the entire room. God does not recognize unions built on deception. Everyone stopped talking. Conversations died mid sentence. The bride's face crumbled. What are you talking about? The groom asked, his voice tight. The ant pointed directly at me. He's hiding something. Non drinkers always are. It's a sign of moral corruption. I just stood there. Champagne glass still extended toward me. Stop. The bride's mother tried to intervene. Patricia, please sit down. No, the aunt cut her off sharply. I will not sit down while this family walks into disaster. She turned to address the entire party now, her voice rising. Seen this before. My ex husband didn't drink either. You know what he was hiding. Nobody answered. The room had gone dead silent. An entire second family, she said, her voice cracking, two children I never knew about, a mortgage in another state. 20 years of lies. The bride's father stood up. Patricia, that's enough. It started with not drinking.

So I kicked them out and now he can use his talents on the streets instead. The kids, 9 years old and has been stealing since he was 5. It started small candy bars from gas stations, toys from other kids at take care. My brother would always brush it off. He's just a kid. He doesn't understand property yet. By the time he was 7, target security had caught him twice. Both times they let him go because he's a minor. My brother actually laughed about it once at a family dinner like it was some cute quirk. I didn't think it was funny then and I definitely don't now. Last year, his school called my brother in because the kid had stolen three different phones from other students, backpacks, not borrowed, stole, hit them in his locker and denied everything until they check cameras. My brother paid the family's back and promised to get him help. Never happened. No therapy, no consequences, nothing. A month ago, my brother showed up at my door with his wife and the kid. He'd lost his job at the warehouse and they were three weeks from eviction. He begged me to let them stay while he got back on his feet. He's doing Uber Eats now while applying to places, trying to save enough for a deposit on A new apartment. I said no at first, specifically because of his son. But my mom got involved, called me heartless and said, he's your brother. So I caved, told my brother straight up, your kid touches my stuff, you're all gone. He promised it wouldn't be an issue. Two weeks in, I caught the kid in my bedroom going through my closet. I told my brother to control.

But now the truth came out. I was 22, just started my dream job as a mechanic, when my phone exploded with hate messages. My 16 year old cousin Sarah told everyone I've been sneaking into her room and got her pregnant. Nobody asked for my side. My mom screamed through tears that I was disgusting, asking how she such a monster. Dad just hung up on me. My sister Emma blocked me on everything without a word. Even my grandmother, who practically raised me after my parents divorce, hung up crying, saying she was too ashamed to talk to me. Sarah was the family princess. Straight A's, honor roll, church, youth group leader. Every Sunday, I was the high school dropout. Within 24 hours, the whole extended family had turned against me. My aunt posted these long Facebook rants about protecting our children from creeps hiding in our own family. My uncles were leaving voicemails threatening to beat the hell out of me if they ever saw me again. Cousins I grew up with were sharing screenshots of our old photos with comments like, can't believe I trusted this creep. I waited every single day for police to show up with handcuffs. Every knock on my door made my heart stop. Every unknown phone number sent me into panic attacks, thinking it was detectives or lawyers. I lost everything, piece by piece. A job at The auto shop because I couldn't focus. Kept making stupid mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss Mike, finally sat me down after three months and said whatever was happening at home needed to stay there. But I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment four months later when I couldn't make rent. Moved in with my buddy Jake, who let me crash on his couch. But even Jake started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Dude, where's your family? It's been six months and I've never seen a single relative. Made up lies about them living far away, being busy, having drama. Dating became impossible. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried seeing asked to meet my parents after two months. I panicked and told her they passed in a car accident. She was so sympathetic it made me sick. Second girl saw through everything when she noticed I had zero family photos in my apartment, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. When I couldn't give her a straight answer, she was gone by morning. Holidays destroyed me completely. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call, someone who cared they existed. I drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway. Knowing they were all inside laughing and eating together without me. I finally moved 3 states away to Colorado. And started completely over. New job at a different auto shop, new apartment, new friends who knew nothing about my past. For years I lived like I had no family. Like I just appeared out of nowhere as an adult. Never dated seriously, because I couldn't risk anyone digging too deep into my background. Built walls so high I forgot what it felt like to trust anyone. Then last month, my phone rang at eleven PM. Unknown Colorado number. Which was weird because nobody had

So I booked a last minute flight and left her to figure out where her free childcare went. It started two years ago when she had her third kid. Grayson was a surprise pregnancy and suddenly Natalie was overwhelmed and needed support. I get it. Three kids under 7 is a lot. So when she asked me to watch them one Saturday so she could catch up on sleep, I said yes. That one Saturday turned into every Saturday. Then Sundays got added because she and her husband Jared needed couple time. Then Friday nights because she deserve date nights after everything she does. Her kids are 7, 4 and 2. The seven year old Presley has a list of screen time rules longer than a rental agreement. No tablets after six, only educational apps, 30 minute maximum. The four year old Brantly is allergic to everything, dairy, gluten, red dye. I had to buy special groceries just for him. The two year old Grayson still isn't potty trained. I've cleaned more accidents off my couch than I want to. I never got paid, not once. Not even gas money. When I finally mentioned it after about 6 months, Natalie actually laughed. You're family. Family doesn't charge family for help. Meanwhile, I watched her Instagram Stories, spa days with girlfriends, bottomless mimosa brunches, concert tickets in the third row, a weekend trip to Nashville for her birthday, all while I was at home wiping noses, breaking up fights over toys and heating up Dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets. Last Thanksgiving, she dropped the kids off Thursday morning so she could focus on cooking. She didn't pick them up until Saturday. I missed my own friendsgiving because I was stuck watching her children. In December, she asked me to take them for an entire weekend because Jared surprised her with a ski trip. When I said I had plans, she told our mom I was being difficult. Mom called and guilted me into canceling my plans. Every time I tried to say no, I was the problem. You don't even have kids. What else are you doing? It's not like you're seeing anyone. Family helps family. Three weeks ago, she texted me on Thursday night, not asked. Nexted, bringing the kids over Saturday at 8. We're doing a wine tour with the Hendersons, picking them up Sunday afternoon. Thanks. I read it three times. No question Mark. No. Are you free? Just an announcement that my entire weekend was now her.

Both her and her son would have died. Did your brother survive or no? Uh, I. I want to continue with this point. So she was offered the opportunity for an abortion because not only was she the main breadwinner of her family, but she is also, um, raising two kids as well already. She's a. She's. The right to an abortion is possibly. Could have saved her life. She did end up surviving, but not. I don't think that, um, we should limit the ability to get an abortion to other women in her situation. Wait, hold on. Time out. So your brother. You know now, huh? Is your brother survive or no? Yes, he did. Wait, so aren't you glad your brother wasn't aborted? I mean, come on. I don't. What kind of argument is that? Aren't you glad that your brother's not dead? It's not that. I. Not. I'm. I'm glad that he wasn't aborted, yes. So that's also pro life. That's what we want. We don't want your brother to be aborted. Imagine how many Millions other like him are aborted. Yes, but if my mom died. She didn't. It's not even a good argument. Well, there's so many people that did. No, that's not correct. I said that earlier. It only happens a couple dozen times a year, and the baby could be delivered by C section. People with Vasa previa have a much higher rate of death than other women. Yes, that happens. And this maybe a couple hundred times a year. And there's 1.5 million abortions every single year. This is on the extreme. If we have to take away abortions, then we're taking away from everybody, even the people who have a medical need for abortion, where the baby is going to kill them if they come out again. I, I can grant you that. Fine, we'll have those exceptions. Can we make abortion illegal for the other circumstances? No, because then. So maybe it's not about those circumstances. No. Oh, it is about those circumstances. Because when we take away those rights from everyone, and we go into a hospital and there's an emergency need to remove a baby, then we have to prove that there's an actual emergency need instead of just it being an automatic right. Then, doctors, you don't have a right to murder another human being. It's not necessarily a right. It's just a ability to be. So when your brother was in your mom's womb, was your brother a human being? I mean, it's. That's. I Don't want to argue that. I think that we can argue about that. It's a very, it's not an argument. It's a long time. When your brother was in, when your brother was in the womb, was it a human being? I, I, I believe that, um, on my moral compass, I believe that he was. But I don't think that my moral compass should dictate the medical needs and so the societal needs of others. Fine. What moral compass should we use to write laws, then? And not necessarily a single one. I think that everyone's moral compass is different. And which one wins? And which one should say, let's, for example, the one that supports women the most, the one that allows women to get though. What standard, though? Why is that? What, why is that good? I mean, by what book do you reference? By some moral standard you're appealing to? What is it? Thank you for your time.

Oh, okay. Which you posted on X two months ago. That the Supreme Court has never reviewed the 14th amendment regarding birthright citizenship. Not correctly yet. Have you heard of Wong versus Kimark? Yes. It's A VS. America. What about Pluto? I'm drawing from a lot of memory on this, so I'm gonna have to plead a little bit of. That's fine. I have. I have a. A shallow understanding, but both of those cases ruled that regardless of national origin, the children of immigrants will become US citizens. It is not just the children of immigrants that the. It's not just that. It's the exact. The exception for diplomats. The children of visitors become US citizens. Right. And so, for example, look. For example, a pregnant woman can leave China who's eight months pregnant, get a 90 day visitor visa, and then her baby becomes a US citizen. How is it being implemented now? If you come here illegally, if you come here illegally, your children know what. What are they. They become US citizens. And that's the Supreme Court president. So the executive order to overturn it, yes, is legal? No, it's very much legal. It's challenging the prior Supreme Court decision. But let's go back to my. My example. You can fly to China and literally just come here as a visitor, show up at a hospital, and, you know, they will give you a US passport and your Kid becomes US citizen. You understand? We are one of the only countries in the industrialized world that has birth right citizenship. And I am proud to be that. We are a country of immigrants. we're not. No, no, no. We're a country of settlers, not of immigrants. Okay? That's a big distinction. Let me tell you the difference. Settlers are people that build a new country that was barren. Immigrants come to a country already built. The people who built this country, they went west to an unconquered, barren country and built a new society. Immigrants helped enrich it. They helped grow it upon that. But the foundation of America, we're settlers, not immigrants. That is a. That is a talking point that we have used. No unifying religion, no unifying race, no unifying. No national origin. We. But what we do share is that if you were born on the soil, you have an inherent birthright to the benefits of American citizenship. And when you read. And that's a huge mistake. And that's a huge mistake. So you disagree with 200 years of president? Yes. Have you read what was discussed during the founding of the fathers? First and foremost, never wanted all of a sudden a pregnant woman to be able to get on. Didn't have airplanes back then. Go across the ocean, and all of a sudden they become a US citizen. Those who draft of the 14th amendment did. Yeah, the 14th amendment, Was in what year, 1866? Yeah, exactly. Way past the founding era. So you don't number two with. No. The 14th amendment was largely applicable to free slaves. I understand that was a purpose, but it was. It has also been extended to those who. Exactly. No, you're right. Has been wrongly extended. You know the 14th amendment by the Supreme Court. Exactly. And they got it wrong, just like the how they got row versus Wade wrong, and we got that repealed.

Now, your counter argument is like, look, dude, it's 5,000 guys. It's not that big of a deal. True. But it sends a signal that we better be serious about cutting in every department, including the Pentagon. By the way, we should cut the defense budget as well because our nation is careening towards bankruptcy. So I just want you to understand from our perspective that nobody should be necessarily off limits from getting us towards a balanced budget. I do understand that. But I think that it also sends a message that we as a country or at least the government doesn't support that sector as a part of stuff that it, the government should like enforce. Fair enough. That's a good point. Thank you. Yeah. Any other questions? You're, I do. Yeah, really. So, um, I just, I'm curious what, uh, who you think Elon Musk has in his best interest. Uh, you really, you wanna live in a country that has a balanced budget and the US dollar reigns supreme. So let's look at the incentive structure. Why would the world's wealthiest man go do this? I want you to tell me what you think. And I'll tell you what I think. I think it's because he is trying to get money for Spacex and he has proposed internally, uh, bills to, to get money for his corporation. So That he can. So let's pause. So, so far his net worth has gone down like $100 billion. So if his goal is to get wealthy, he's not doing great. But he's asking our government for more money for space. Well, he's asking for contracts to go do necessary things for the space fight. Now, I'm, I totally agree that there should probably be an independent review board. He's very close to the president. We got to be close to make sure there's no corruption there. I totally agree, even though I know both Elon and the president. Okay. I, respectfully, I'm gonna disagree. I do wanna ask though, um, what is your opinion on, uh, trying to get rid of the two party system in America? Because personally, I think that it as a system divides us more than anything. I'm, I'm all for it. Democrats should abolish their party first and then we'll go next. Interesting. I, I mean, yes. Look, here's the problem. You're talking about the issue of permanency of factions. George Washington wrote about this extensively. Federalist Papers. Yeah. Yeah. The issue is just eventually in a national system, you're gonna be organized into two political parties. Was it not Madison that said that? Yeah. No, Madison and Washington. Washington warned, warned about two things, permanent political parties and permanent alliances. Those are his two big warnings. Okay. I, I wanna get some other questions though. Okay. Uh, thank you.

Okay. So I, I'm glad to be an American. I'm glad to live in this country either as far as I know, there's no better country. Um, and, and part of that is that we don't, we don't prosecute people for things they did before it was illegal. Now, my question is, well, first off, I'll state, um, the law is to first off inform people. Secondly, um, persuade them. Um, um, uh, and thirdly to, to, you're gonna talk about pro life laws and potentially criminalizing women that get abortions. Right. Right. And my question, no, I, I, I'm, I'm 10 steps ahead of you. Got it. So let me tell you my position cause we only have so much time. Right? My, my question for you is why are you against abolition? Okay. No, so actually I am for the abolition of abortion. But let me tell you why I personally say if an abortion law was passed, I don't think it would a, be the right thing under the current way that abortion is practiced in America to say that if a woman gets an abortion, she should then go to jail. Let me tell you why it's, cause the way abortion is practiced in this country, women are not given informed consent. They do not know a lot of times what they are doing when they get an abortion. Now that it's a very important distinction in Order to criminalize somebody, you need in the criminal statute, not the civil statute, you need intent. Right. Great. Right. So, and the law would cover that. Yes. So this is a, I think, a largely unhelpful, very far distant hypothetical that does a couple things. Not only do I disagree with it, but individuals like yourself are going around saying that we should put women in prison if they get abortions. There's, there's nothing that says what the punishment. Okay. But however, let me just pause and say, how about first, can we at least agree the people doing the abortions, like the abortionist, they should go to federal prison for the rest of their life. We can agree on that. And so I don't want to spend too much time on this. My perspective is very simple that if you do not have informed consent, then I have a very hard time using the criminal code to go after an individual. Our justice system doesn't work like that. If, if, if there was not intent, then the justice system says you weren't a criminal. Okay. Then, then we agree. Then, then therefore, it shouldn't go after those individuals. If you can't prove intent, then it should not go after those individuals. Thank you so much for your time. I gotta get to the next question. Thank you. We should have laws against it.

So who are you as an individual? From your skin color to your eye color to your likes, your dislikes, from your temperament to your everything? I am not an embryo. I'm person. Hold on a second. But it started with something called deoxyribonucleic acid. And your own individual DNA started at The point of egg and sperm meeting, that's where your journey started. And so from that point in particular, life begins. Not, not at birth, not at first words, not at first steps, but when your DNA, which is who you actually are, your. You are your DNA. Every one of your DNA cells is coded X, X, or X, Y. It's coded with all of your unique characteristics and attributes that god. We believe god, individually curated for the rest of your life. That doesn't happen at eight weeks or 10 weeks. It happens at conception. What happens if you need a medical abortion? If the mother. Okay, will die if she does not get an abortion. So what's your stance on that? The only. The only place where medical abortion is necessary is before 20 weeks, which is incredibly rare. What if she will die? What if the mother will die? Hold on a second. So let's take they, for example, like. This is a very important question. Let's say it's 27 weeks, okay, and the mother will die. Why shouldn't you could agree? Why don't we just have the baby delivered by cesarean section? You know what a cesarean section is, right? Yes. What is a cesarean section? A C section? Yeah. Why wouldn't we just put the baby up by C section instead of terminating it? Because if the mother will die. it's not safe to do that. You remove the baby. I Understand threat. Remove. I know what a C section is, but it's actually safer than an abortion. So every time they say, this is for you guys, they say, oh, you need to have abortion for medical reasons. Respond. Then have a C section. What if you're not able to have a C section? What if you are on your deathbed? You need to have an abortion right now. Well, again, but. And it's illegal, you can't, so you actually have to die first. First and foremost, C section is safer, C section is quicker, and a C section saves both lives.

I mean if I I was wanting to have a child and my contraceptives I didn't use any contraceptives and I wanted to get pregnant sure I'm taking responsibility for that life because I wanted that life but let's say I was used having sex and my contraceptives didn't work and I got the chance of getting pregnant I am not having that child so but you still decided to have sex yeah, you and and again our our opinion when you go and decide having sex is not something you need to survive it's not like showering or eating or shelter you can live without having sex you can have a little bit of self control if you decide to go have sex you should understand you play certain games you win certain prizes which might be another human life and it is the most I don't wanna another child though hold on a second then don't go have sex no oh, so you understand how narcissistic that is that I want to keep on having fun and if I have a human being and oopsy Daisy I'm gonna eliminate that other human being Cause I don't wanna have the human being, but I wanna keep on having free sex. How is that not the most narcissistic world view that one can possibly espouse is narcissistic that I wanna have sex with another consenting individual just because I don't wanna have children? I feel like a lot of people in the world have sex. I think a lot of people make money off of having sex and they don't wanna have children. I feel like it is something that everybody do. A lot of people have sex just for pleasure. Again, just because a lot of people do it does not make it right, No. 1. No. 2, again, fundamentally your view is, I'm going to do whatever I wanna do. And if I have a question, if it creates other human being, so be it. Sure. Do you have sex just to have a baby every single time then? Or are you doing it for pleasure? I am. I am married and we have two kids. Tits. Yeah, I'm pretty good at it. Are you, so, like, I'm assuming that you have had sex more than twice in your life. Again, I'm not gonna like give you an inside look into my sex life, but, but you're doing it for pleasure, not just to have kids. Well, again, we, we actually always do it with God's trust that if we get kids, it's a blessing.

This ensures the electric current flows directly through the brain, delivering a quick and painless death. But a rookie prison guard, new to the job, neglected to wet the sponge during one execution. Curious about what would happen, he placed the dry sponge directly under the prisoner's head. Paul, the officer overseeing the execution, noticed something wasn't right. But before he could intervene, the signal was given and the switch was pulled. The execution began. The prisoner immediately began experiencing unimaginable pain. Everyone present noticed that something was terribly wrong. Paul shared his suspicions with his colleagues, but once the electric chair is activated, there's no stopping it. All they could do was watch. The crowd watching the execution began to smell burning flesh. Horrified people started leaving their seats, desperate to escape. Even the rookie guard hadn't expected it to be so gruesome. The warden demanded to know why the power hadn't been shut off. Paul simply replied, because the prisoner is still alive. Somehow, one of the men in the prison seemed to be physically experiencing the pain himself. The rookie couldn't bear to watch any longer. Paul grabbed him and turned him back toward the scene, forcing him to witness what he had done. Only after the prisoner had been burned to a crisp and was finally dead did Paul give the order to Cut the power. The warden stormed in, furious, demanding an explanation. All fingers eventually pointed to Percy. The rookie Paul simply ordered that he be transferred out immediately. The man who had felt the pain of the execution, he was no ordinary inmate, turned to Paul and with a meaningful tone said that no matter how horrific the process was, the prisoner was actually lucky. The pain he himself had experienced left him shattered both mentally and physically. Then he turned away and quietly went to sleep. This man.

Cuando noté que el guardaespaldas detrás de mí llevaba la funda del arma abierta. Esa mínima señal me hizo sentir un peligro inmediato al ver que no parecía una mala persona. Bajé la guardia por un momento, pero al seguir observando los alrededores del presidente me di cuenta de que algo no cuadraba en el lugar. Muchos espectadores agitaban banderas de colores. Como francotirador profesional, sabía que aquello no eran solo simples banderas, también podían ser instrumentos para medir la dirección del viento. Avisé de inmediato al coronel a mi lado para que asegurara todos los puntos elevados en un radio de 2km. Los equipos de seguridad se movilizaron enseguida, pero de pronto noté que el viento se había detenido casi por completo. Otra vez el peligro me golpeó el instinto. De repente, un disparo estalló a mis espaldas. En ese instante comprendí por fin que esta misión de protección presidencial, era en realidad una trampa cuidadosamente montada contra mí. Por suerte, reaccioné a tiempo y salté por la ventana. Ahora sabía con claridad que debía salir de ese lugar cuanto antes, que ya me habían convertido en un fugitivo buscado en toda la ciudad. Las fuerzas de tierra, mar y aire tenían sus ojos puestos en mí. No había corrido mucho cuando choqué de frente con un policía. Para evitar que descubriera mi identidad, lo neutralicé rápidamente. Le supliqué que me creyera que me había entendido una trampa. En un impulso, tomé su arma Robé su coche patrulla y escapé del lugar a toda velocidad, las calles estaban llenas de patrullas buscándome y además seguía herido por un disparo anterior. Para despistar a la policía, entré en un túnel de lavado. Mientras el coche era limpiado, me pasé al asiento trasero y me vendé la herida lo más rápido que pude. Después salí del lugar sin perder un segundo. Pronto la policía localizó mi vehículo y me acercó bajo un gran puente. Al ver cómo llegaban más patrullas, metí marcha atrás y me lancé directamente al río. Cuando los agentes alcanzaron la orilla, ya había desaparecido bajo la cobertura de un barco grande. Conseguí eludir temporalmente la persecución. Aún así, no podía relajarme. Robé otro coche cerca del puente, sabiendo que toda la atención policial seguía concentrada en el río. Al poco tiempo logré salir de la ciudad. Lo primero que hice fue ir a casa de mi exnovia porque ella era doctora. Cuando me vio, se asustó. Ya había visto las noticias sobre mi orden de arresto. Por suerte, los lazos del pasado aún pesaban. Finalmente me abrió la puerta y comenzó a atender mi herida de bala. Durante la conversación, supe que quien había caído no era el presidente, sino el arzobispo que estaba a su lado. Al comprender que todo había sido una trampa para inculparme, decidí descubrir quién estaba detrás de toda aquella conspiración

Not even a single red flower can stay. It must be picked immediately or it'll bring death because a bloodthirsty monster lives outside the village. Red is its forbidden colour. If it sees red, it kills everyone in sight. Villagers can't leave the gate either. Step past the border and the monster tears you to pieces. But Eddie didn't believe the rumors. He not only left the village, he picked a bunch of red flowers in the forest. That very night, strange things happened. A night watchman saw a red draped monster charge into the village. He yanked the alarm bell. Hearing the bell, the villagers bolted for home. They hid in the cellars they'd prepared. Their faces showed exactly how terrifying the monster was. Right then, Eddie's girlfriend waited at the door, frantic the monster was about to swallow her whole. Eddie arrived in time and yanked her inside. He slammed the door shut and rushed her into the cellar to hide. But the next day, the monster left a Mark on Eddie's door that meant its revenge wasn't over. To appease the monster, the villagers offered sacrifices at once, hoping to earn its forgiveness. Sure enough, the monster didn't show up. That night, the village returned to a brief calm.

Even on cliff edges, he doesn't forget to drive on the right side. Morning. Good. And talk. After arriving home safely, everyone's tense nerves instantly relax. It's only then that Homer remembers Maggie is still in the car. However, a child alone in the car is extremely dangerous, especially with a cake. Marge hurriedly asks everyone to find the spare key. Okay, the spare key is somewhere in here. If progress goes well, they should be able to find it in two hours. Just then, Maggie appears with the key. Hello! Faced with so many keys, Lisa is quite puzzled. Homer explains that if you live long enough, you can accumulate many things. By maintaining this habit, you can amass unimaginable wealth. Marge thinks they should return the keys one by one, but Bart and Homer don't agree. Homer, stop him! Stop who, Marge? Be specific. Bart takes a set of spare keys and prepares to start pranking. First, he opens the federal post office mailbox. Oh, thank god! I can get back the angry letter I wrote to my boss! Bart didn't expect his bad intentions would result in a good deed. Unwilling to accept defeat, he continues his mischief. He activates a high rise elevator platform, planning to give everyone a but performance. Just then, an old man preparing to jump off the building falls onto his elevator platform. You're my naked fairy god, boy! Oh, jeez, I hope no one heard you say that. For this, the mayor even awards him an honorary key. But he has one request. And lower your pants for the picture. No! Meanwhile, Homer takes the brewery Key, planning to have a blast with Barney. The two sneak into the factory and find the advertising blimp of their dreams. Oh, how I'd love to drive that thing! Seeing the blimp enthusiastically inviting him, Homer can't wait to take off his clothes and run aboard. This move instantly bewilders Barney. When we see each other again, you'll be an old man. Be a baby! During the flight, Homer is amazed to discover the refrigerator is full of beer. But he doesn't know if drinking while piloting a blimp counts as drunk driving. Cleverly, he takes out his phone to text for help. Just like that, the blimp flies through a roller coaster, airplane routes and tunnels. What was that? The police quickly noticed the out of control blimp. He hurriedly follows behind, shouting. Ignoring him makes it very dangerous for the birds flying in the sky. Hello, suckers! It's up! All the humanity! Meanwhile, Marge has finished organizing all the keys. Looking at only one key left for a wind up mechanism, she suddenly remembers this is a prank gift Homer gave her. The moment she makes the phone call, the model car quietly slips away. The toy passes by Flanders House and the sound it makes instantly attracts two Children, Jesus Christ! Blood every time you lie. The model car travels all the way to the gastrointestinal support group. The group members feel deeply humiliated at this moment. Marge rushes over to inquire. You mean you're wind up hate crime? Oh! Then it crosses the bridge and drives to Clancy's side. Marge shouts for him to help. Clancy says things on the ground are not within his jurisdiction. A thief, hearing this, discovers the loophole. Really rubbing it in. Ho, ho, ho! Maybe if I use a pen on another front. Lisa takes the school key, preparing to return it to the principal. Nelson, passing by, says this key can open any door in the school. But unfortunately, she's a goody two shoes, living the same life every day. And the day before that, and the day before that. Lisa's curiosity gradually becomes aroused. Unknowingly, she arrives at the school's dilapidated basement. Everything here reveals an eerie atmosphere. But the moment she opens the door, she's instantly shocked. Five illogical classrooms are actually combined together. The pull down maps are empty. The rulers have no markings, and even the tooth model has no enamel. Lisa flees in terror. What is going on? She immediately finds the principal to tell him about this. The principal absolutely refuses to acknowledge it. It's real. They bring student journalist to the basement unexpectedly. When they open the door, there's only a bookshelf. The principal thinks Lisa is too nervous and writing a few Test papers will solve it, but his panicked expression makes Lisa sense something is definitely wrong. Unwilling to give up, she returns to the classroom again. It turns out the bookshelf behind the door was added later. At this moment, she discovers a sneaky shadow. Lisa finds Bart to seek help. They find Nelson, who has been held back the most to understand the situation. At this moment, Homer appears at the school piloting the blimp, but due to his questionable skills, the aircraft nose dives vertically. The next second, who needs so many buttons? Lisa urgently presses the pause button and gets ejected outside the aircraft cabin. At this moment, she suddenly sees school bus 23 at the bottom of the water, which is actually full of students. Seeing this, Homer quickly jumps from the aircraft to rescue Lisa. As a result, he's too fat and gets stuck in the opening. Yes, and I got gum on my shoe! Bart hurriedly grabs a fire extinguisher to rescue him. His heavy body flips the school bus over. All the students on the bus are rescued. Lisa discovers in horror that all the students are dummies. The two are instantly submerged in the water by the dummies. At this moment, Marge's model car crashes into a large tree and the two are rescued. The storylines perfectly converge at this point. I'm sorry, homie. It's worse than you think. I have to buy you a new anniversary present. Lisa still doesn't understand Why there are so many models in the school bus. Everyone comes to the school to question the principal. The principal has no choice but to tell the truth from back then. He put the subsidy allowance in his pocket unexpectedly. His mother accidentally shredded the money while doing laundry. To give an explanation to the relevant authorities, he had to rent some props and take some photos. But unfortunately, funds were limited, so we had the driver return them the same day. But he ultimately didn't account for Homer buying a giant cake and Maggie being locked in the car. We planned for the wedding cake. We just didn't see the baby thing coming. Well, you should have. How could I? She wasn't even born yet. People

The moment she arrived, three jocks locked their eyes on her. Two girls tried to warn her. Be careful. Those guys are players. The girl only smiled, a sly, dangerous smile. Between classes, the school's heartthrob found. Student A, handed her two boxes of chocolate sticks. She lit up until he said, one's for her, the others just cab fare for you. Her smile froze. Jealousy burned. She shoved both boxes at the new girl. I don't eat your stuff. The girl smirked. Good. You should lose some weight anyway. That cut deep. Student A's anger exploded. After school, the three boys showed up again. This time waving two concert tickets, hoping the girls would invite her to their party. They refused. Stayed loyal. The next morning, a rose sat on the new girl's desk. She crushed it under her bag. She hated roses. But when she noticed Student B liked it, she handed it over. Student A rolled her eyes, pulled out her phone, started trashing the new girl online. Later that day, one boy asked Student B for tutoring. But kept flirting with the new girl instead. B's heart shattered. She ran to the bathroom in tears. Student A followed her in. And jealousy found A partner. Together they started to plan.

She held her breath as long as she could before finally resurfacing, but she still didn't dare climb out because he was staring right at her. With no choice, she swam to the back area to get dressed, only to find her clothes were already gone. Terrified, she slipped back into the water again. She begged the man to help her find her clothes, and he actually looked excited. He pretended to search the bushes, but it was obvious there was nothing there. Seeing how desperate she was, the man suddenly came up with an idea. He grabbed a burlap sack from his horse and the woman was relieved, thinking this kind man was going to help her make something to wear. But he simply tossed the sack into the river. She was furious. How was she supposed to use a soaking wet bag? But the next second, all the color drained from her face. The man stepped into the water and started walking toward her.

Abe's arrival brings a lot of inconvenience to Homer's family. Hey, you call that making love? Homer, I told you he wouldn't sleep through it. My day, women didn't make a sound. Not only does it interfere with Homer's chances to have intimate time. But Bart and Lisa are also tormented to the point of numbness. The first thing they do when they wake up is rush to eat breakfast. They need to leave before Abe wakes up. That's him! Mom! Quick! Our lunches! Go save yourselves! As it turns out, the two are still a step too late. They're caught at the door by Abe, who's about to go out. However, Abe has completely changed his tone. Is Now gentle and peaceful. Everyone feels very surprised. This makes Lisa suspect whether Homer used the purified liquid. You look tense. Let's discuss this over a cup of Grandpa's coffee. From then on, Abe becomes very kind. Lisa still can't convince herself. She decides to tell Abe the truth. Dad, I know what you did. And I locked the back door. No! Abe is stunned after learning the truth.

That day, Homer accidentally hit a tree stump while driving. Though badly injured, Homer survived. Aww. Where's Lisa when you need her? However, Lisa could not be saved and her life ended at age 8. At Lisa's grave, Homer blamed god for treating him this way. Whenever he misses Lisa, Homer watches old videotapes to make amends. Homer resolved to spend more time with Bart while watching TV. Bart wanted to eat a pizza. Without hesitation, Homer drove him out to buy it. Right to the right. Right to the left. Get here, old man. This time, Homer lost his child. Once more, grief enveloped the Simpson family. Yet a month later, Homer grew used to life without Lisa and Bart. That day, he saw a pizza ad in the newspaper. He planned to take Maggie along, but Marge snatched Maggie away. She feared Maggie might also be in trouble. From that moment on, Marge grew to despise Homer. Deadly. She gradually became acquainted with their neighbor, Flanders. One day when Homer was away, they kissed. Homer, just back from a business trip, caught Marge cheating. Homer was furious. He even punched Marge in the face. Maggie, witnessing this, was terrified. She scrambled to the phone and called the police. After the police arrived, Marge chose to conceal the truth. Homer felt the police were meddling in their private affairs. After the police left, Marge applied the medicine. To herself. She then took Maggie away from Homer. But Homer had become a demon. He brutally murdered Maggie and Marge. He believed this would keep his fam.

Like she was like, I love you and like I wish you were the person for me, but like you're not. And I have to lay this down and I have to let you go. And I think the highest form of love that we can share right now is to let each other go because we're not meant for each other. It's so hard to let someone go when nothing happened. Like the final goodbye was, I love you, I'll always be here for you. And if we find our way back to each other, then we do. But until then, like this is goodbye. I think deep down that's probably what hurts the most. It's like I wanted to be the guy for her, but I wasn't, you know, I wasn't. I probably wasn't the right guy for her. I think I told myself I could have been, but I didn't deserve her. I didn't deserve her one bit. That girl was the purest, sweetest, nicest person I've ever talked to in my entire life.

It was quickly ground into powder. Then while the boss wasn't looking, I dumped an entire bag of human bones into it. Now all the evidence of my crime was destroyed. I just didn't know who would end up eating this human bone flour. I used to be an ordinary old man. I couldn't even bring myself to kill a chicken. But now I had become a murderer, all because of a terrible decision I made years ago. Back then, my son wanted to go to America for further studies. He asked me for two and a half million rupees. But for a poor family like ours, I simply couldn't afford it. Yet I didn't want to disappoint my son, so I applied for a bank loan. But the bank only approved 1 million rupees. For the remaining 1.5 million, I had no choice but to mortgage the house and take a high interest loan. I thought once my son finished his studies, got a good job and earned money, I would be able to pay off the debt. But I never expected my own son to betray me. He did find a good job in America. He even got married and had children. But he never helped me repay the debt. He was even annoyed by me and my wife. Every time we talked, he grew impatient, especially when I mentioned the loan. He always found excuses to hang up. So the pressure of paying the huge debt fell entirely on us. One midnight, the thug Johnny came for money again, brought a woman with him. He made the woman touch my feet. In India, this is the highest gesture of respect to elders, but I was too scared to say a word. Before he even spoke, I hurried into the house and brought out the interest for the month. Johnny noticed it was 2000 short, but he didn't question me. Instead, he walked into my bedroom with the woman. A minute later, they came out with their clothes messy. Looking at my ruined room, I knew it was both a warning and a humiliation. A few days later, I had just withdrawn some money from the bank when Johnny targeted me again. He snatched the money from me. When he found his car wouldn't start, he ordered me to push it. I didn't dare resist and obeyed quietly. But even such hardship did not crush my kindness. As a retired teacher, I did everything I could to tutor poor children for free. I even saved from my tiny living expenses to buy them cakes for their birthdays. But it was because of these children that I reached a dead end. That day, Johnny brought a man over to look at the house. He planned to sell my house to repay the loan. I.

The cat found it tasted terrible. It decided to help the dog break out of jail. It turned out that when the rabbit mayor was taking a bath, he discovered that gold coins didn't fill up his bathtub. He was extremely dissatisfied with this. The rabbit mayor planned to extort money from the citizens. The cat and dog were being chased by gangster dogs. They got cornered by the gangster dogs in an alley. Just as the gang dogs were about to make their move, the rabbit mayor arrested one of the gangster dogs. The reason was they didn't have dog licenses. The gangster dogs were confused and wanted to know when such a law had been enacted. Five minutes earlier, the rabbit had made up this law. One dog told his buddy to run for it. The dog ran into a police car. Fortunately, the cat hid the dog away. The dog didn't get arrested. At this point, the rabbit showed up at the cat and dog's house. Luckily, the cat disguised the dog as a mop. The rabbit thought it was strange, but left anyway. In prison, the rabbit charged all the dogs a fee. This was the fee for the dog license exam. Unfortunately, not a single dog passed the test, so they had to pay to retake the exam. However, when the rabbit took his bath, the gold coin still didn't fill up the bathtub. So the rabbit arrested all the animals in town and demanded they get licenses. But when the rabbit tried to arrest the cat, the cat pulled out a cat license. The rabbit was totally baffled. It turned out the cat had gotten its license years ago. Since the dog didn't have a license, the dog got arrested. All the animals paid the rabbit to take the exam. But still not a single animal passed the test. The rabbit's actions made everyone furious. Everyone was planning a jailbreak. Everyone looked to the dog because the dog could contact the cat on the outside. The food the dog ate in prison was unbearable. The cat swallowed a nail clipper. Then the nail clipper came out of the dog's mouth. This way, all the animals escaped from prison. They found the rabbit taking a bath and gave him a good beating before throwing

The charging herd of yak sense danger, panicked and turned to flee, unaware that a sheer precipice lay ahead. But by the time they realized the peril, it was too late. Witnessing comrades tumbling into the abyss one after another, the Yak King understood he'd fallen into a human trap. To avenge his clan's tragic deaths, the Yak King turned and charged furiously toward the hunters. Along the way, he collided with a frail youth named Jack, very son of the tribes chieftain. Seeing his son in peril, the chieftain hurled his spear with all his might, driving it deep into the bull's belly, but blinded by vengeance, did not halt. For the pain owing to drag Jack into the abyss, the bull ultimately hurled him over the cliff. Everyone rushed nervously to the cliff's edge. Fortunately, Jack did not fall to his death on the spot, but clung desperately to a protruding rock on the cliff edge. Yet he remained over 30 feet from the rim. Rescuing his son from the smooth cliff face proved no easy task. The father screamed frantically from the cliff's edge. Suddenly, the rock shattered. Under the strain, under the horrified stares of the crowd, Jack plummeted once more into the abyss. Watching his son fall, the chieftain sank into profound despair, intending to end his own life. For solace, his tribe pulled him back, for as their leader, he Bore the responsibility for all. The father cried out from the cliff's edge all night long, yet never heard his son's reply. When the truth was revealed, the father was overcome with grief, forced to accept his son's death. But fate showed mercy to Jack once more. He did not plunge into the abyss, but crashed onto a protruding ledge. After an unknown period of unconsciousness, a vulture landed on the boy, savagely pecking at his lips. The excruciating pain jolted Jack awake. But when he looked down, Jack was terrified by what he saw. Staring at the bottomless chasm below, Jack could only try to climb upward, but unexpectedly his foot slipped. He found himself dangling in midair once again. This time, there was no foothold and only exhaustion and death awaited him. Just when all hope seemed lost, a violent storm suddenly struck. Torrential rain cascaded down the cliff face. Jack instantly saw a glimmer of hope for survival. As more and more water accumulated, he gritted his teeth and held on until the very last moment. Finally, when his strength was completely drained, Jack suddenly let go.

She started coughing and said the baby inside the woman was having trouble breathing. The pregnant woman thought she was making it up, but just a few days later, the baby tragically died in the womb. From then on, people around the girl treated her like a curse. Her father had no choice but to move them again. Years later, Anna grew up to become a detective. One day, an old man came to the station to report his daughter missing. She'd been gone for four hours. Anna's colleagues told him they don't take cases for adults missing less than 24 hours. He laughed, but Anna kept a photo of his daughter. The moment she saw the photo, the bell on her wrist jingled again. Then she saw exactly how the girl had been harmed. Anna woke up from a nightmare, knowing it wasn't just a dream. The girl was probably already in grave danger. He memorized the details and followed them to the foot of the mountain where the girl was attacked. But the villagers said they had never seen the girl in the photo. Anna had no choice but to investigate the mountain alone. Meanwhile, her colleagues at the station were investigating a string of murders. All the victims were young, petite women, and the killer's area of operation was large. They figured the culprit was probably a taxi driver. Soon they discovered On surveillance that all three victims had taken the same taxi before they were killed. While her colleagues were busy with the investigation, Anna ran into a taxi driver on the mountain. She showed him the photo and asked if he had seen the girl. To her shock, the driver's face suddenly started twitching.

Whatever looks good at the store, I just throw it all in the cart. No one's gonna give me trouble. I can take the whole store home. Nobody would dare say no because for the past year I've been driving a bus all over the world, haven't found a single human besides myself. So I left messages on billboards along the way saying there is someone alive and tucked in its on. Then I drove to the rich part of Tusa, found a luxury mansion to settle down in. First thing, I had to make it my own, redecorate the whole place. I hauled all the famous paintings from the museum, put them up on the walls, brought Dinosaur fossils in his decorations. I am the only one left on earth anyway. The whole world is my personal property. Whatever I want I take. Pretty soon I had the whole mansion set up exactly how I wanted it, hung up my family photos last, finally finished decorating the place. When I first settled in, I could still have fun just going crazy with everything, eat whatever I wanted. IMP the only customer in every store on earth. Those hundred thus and dollar baller I poured straight into the bathtub for a bath, ran out of water to flush the toilet, drilled a hole in the diving board, turned the pool into a giant outdoor toilet. I've always loved bowling, stacked up a bunch of fish. Tanks, drove my pickup truck right into them like bowling. When I ran out of things to hit, I put a car on a ramp, used it as a bowling ball to hit another car. At first, I thought life was pretty good. Made fun of that guy from castaway talking to a volleyball like it was real. But I never expected, even though I had all the food and drink I wanted in less than six months, I was worse off than that castaway guy. Not only did I start talking to a volleyball, I made companions out of all kinds of balls. But even then, in this world with no women, I still felt incredibly lonely and hopeless. From then on, I stopped caring how I looked. Trash piled up like mountains. When my will to live was completely gone, I drove out to the middle of nowhere, decided I was done living online in this world. But as I drove toward a giant rock, I suddenly saw something. I slammed on the brakes and stopped, jumped out to look. There was smoke rising in the distance.

You're grieving the person that you thought you were with that person and you're grieving the plans you had for the future. There's a lot of grieving going on in this process. So what do you do?

There were lots of signs you just ignored them because the sex was great or you ignored them because they said the right thing in the evening. You ignored them because you didn't wanna be lonely. You ignored them because you love the gift they gave you on your birthday. You ignored them because your friends thought they were really cool.

That's where she lives. You heard right. Nicole Jones and her children are forced to live in a garage right in the middle of one of America's wealthiest zip codes, Silicon Valley. This is the garage. Nicole, who's a bartender, pays $1,000 a month for the converted garage in San Mateo, California. I know it's a garage, but this was nicer than everything that I had looked at that was almost twice this price. Nicole says she can no longer afford to live in the area where the average rent tops three grand a month. Employees from companies like apple and Google searching for housing have pushed rents into the stratosphere. Nicole's cramped garage home is only 250 square feet, but big enough to hold her bed in the Bay Area. It breaks your heart because these people don't know. She says all the publicity has spooked her landlord. She's afraid he'll evict her, leaving her and her children homeless. I can go to bed at night knowing that I tried.

Then the doctor injected Homer's arm with a sobriety shot. Mo desperately told Marge, from now on, Homer could never drink again. After quitting drinking, Homer's career started taking off. He was now a good family man. Lenny was the same way. After quitting drinking, he worked out and got in great shape. Sober, Carl developed hair robots about to go public. Even Barney, the biggest alcoholic, found his dream job. But Mo, lacking customers, had no choice but to become an egg cook. The guys couldn't stand seeing Mo so down. So they hired Mo to be their bartender again. You mean it? Yeah, we do. From now on, you can spray your own pants. America! The drinking buddies gathered together again. Even drinking snake grass water made them happy. This loyalty moved the bartender's association. He offered everyone the antidote to the sobriety shot. One injection would remove all the benefits of sobriety. Homer's conflicted face reflected in the glass. He now had a happy family and a rising career. He didn't want to give up his successful life. So he refused the antidote and walked out the door. But the bartender's association wouldn't let him go. He pulled out a coin and put it in the arcade machine. Finally, he issued an arrest warrant for Homer. All the bartenders in the city came to arrest Homer.

Witness will answer the question. I don't remember, young lady. My offer to sentence you for contempt is still on the table. Fine. Maybe I did attend that performance. I'm busy.

No. But Empress Katya profited from that video under a corporate sponsorship with Angry Girl Cosmetics worth almost $200,000.

This streamer not only eats a lot, but also likes to add huge amounts of chili peppers to his food. Upon learning that there would be a competitive eating challenge in Springfield on October 6th, Homer immediately rushed to the venue to watch. But the streamer was in very poor condition. He staggered over to the meatballs and collapsed on the ground after just one bite. A staff member nearby told the townspeople that the streamer had filmed 400 episodes of competitive eating videos in two months, so his body couldn't hold up anymore. Come on, Fred, eat too much or something so we know you're okay. Sorry, man. Looks like this time food beat dude. Homer couldn't help but feel a bit sad, but was quickly drawn to the meatballs. Alfred, just wish it into the trunk. Awesome. After examination, the doctor found that Sadie had anorexia and might never be able to do competitive eating live streams again. To help Sadie recover his spirits, Homer took him to a secret spot where you could smell the food from all the households in Springfield. This was very helpful for Sadie's recovery. Oh, every individual smell is distinct and takes me back to a specific time and place. Pepperoni pizza, raised bok Choi, rib eye steak.

One day, while he was video calling with Milhouse, Homer appeared on his screen again. Do you have the money? Money, money, money, money, money!

Whatever his classmates gave him, he would eat it all in one bite. And here's something that'll make you forget about the other stuff. I can rumba. Then someone pulled out $20, demanding that he eat the frog on the plate. Just as he was about to reach for it, Lisa stopped him in time, but in his eyes, the frog had transformed into Homer's face, urging him to pay back the money. He eventually picked up the frog and swallowed it whole. Easiest money I ever. The doctor discovered that the frog Bart had eaten was highly poisonous. Bart took out twenty dollars and paid Homer back, but Homer had completely forgotten about the debt. The doctor then handed Homer a four thousand dollar medical Bill.

I'm sorry to say Mr Ornelis has succumbed to his injuries and has died. Due to the change in circumstances, the people will be dismissing this complaint and refiling, your honor, adding the charge of murder in violation of Objection 1, 80 seven a. I asked that the case be dismissed, that the defense demanded and bail set at 2 million and then he be ordered forthwith to the arraignment court. You honor, Macferrin, my client. There is nothing to talk about, Miss Palmer. Please try to restrain yourself. Previously posted bond is exonerated. The defendant is remanded into the custody of the sheriff. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. I was, I was only 17. How can I go to jail? What? I'm sorry, what did you just say? I was only 17. Your honor, I need time to confirm that this is true. Your honour, the people was not Palmer. I will consider the people's motion to dismiss and refile murder charges in the event the defence is unable to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr Paulo was in fact, a juvenile at the time of the offence. Your honour, this is just a plea. Mr Watkins, I need to See proof of your client's age. Yeah. Due to the change in circumstances, I will be remanding Mister Paolo and increasing bail to $500,000. Who tells the cops they're 18 when they're actually a juvenile? I just don't want them calling my foster mom cause she's got enough to deal with. You know, my brothers, we, we bounced around. Her house was the first one that felt like a home. You knew if they thought you were an adult, they wouldn't call. I just didn't think lying about my age was gonna be a big deal. Get me out of here. Mister. What? Do you have someone that can pay bail? No. Well, we need to prove your age. I gotta stay here until I get proof. Your honour, this is a photocopy of miles birth certificate. Your honour, I object to anything that's not an original document. I've got the original right here. Mama Sheldon, you shouldn't be here. Why are you here? Thank you for coming. Mrs. Sheldon. Miles, it's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. I asked you not to call her. I've got his ID, too. Thank you. You can have a seat. This appears to be an original copy of the defendant's birth certificate showing Mister Paulo indeed turned 18 after the alleged incident. Miss Palmer, any objection? No objection, your honour. However, that does not end the jurisdictional analysis. This is a copy of the incident recall report from the L a. P. D. That Shows that the incident was ongoing past midnight when the defendant was legally an adult. The victim's daughter called 9 1 1 at 12:00am and stated that the suspects had just fled in a vehicle and provided the plate number. This means that Mr Paulo was 17 when the incident began and turned 18 in the middle of it. Is that your understanding, Mr Watkins? Your honour, the complaint in this case alleges that the date of the incident was the day before my client turned 18. That means he was 17 on the date of the alleged incident. Miss Palmer, the people will be amending the complaint to reflect the fact that the incident spanned new calendar day. Council, you are both ordered to find authority for your respective positions and brief the issue. For now, I'm going to suspend proceedings in this matter until we resolve the jurisdictional issue.

Hey, Jason, are you seeing this? She kicking or what? But in the next second, the MUD erupted like a massive dragon, smashing through the protective wellhead and knocking everyone around him to the ground. The control room reacted immediately, activating the blowout preventer. Valves and pipes were forcibly shut, successfully halting the incoming MUD. Yet the danger wasn't over. Digga, the person in charge of the drill pipe, had only 30 seconds to open the pipe and release all the pressure, or a much greater disaster would have occurred. Against the odds, he managed it just in time, stopping the erupting MUD and averting what could have been an unimaginable catastrophe.

Someone grabbed my sleeve from behind. She tied me to a pillar. Then she slipped into my fitting room. She lifted up my shirt. She kissed my stomach a few times. She pulled out my phone. She took photos of those lipstick marks. Siri, send this photo to my wife. After doing all this, she shoved the phone back in my pocket. She turned to leave. I stepped on her foot. Her shoe got dirty. The moment she left, I broke free. I grabbed my phone. Photos were already sent. I rushed out to catch her, but she was gone. My wife was storming toward me. I spotted a makeup box nearby. I grabbed the lipstick inside. I rushed back to the fitting room. I put the lipstick on my lips. Then I pressed it onto my T-shirt. Right after I finished, my wife arrived at the door. Open the door! I'm telling you, open the door! What? How could you do this? What? You what? Look at this photo! Why are you laughing? Gotcha!

You almost gave me a heart stroke. Don't choke like that again. That woman walked out of the fitting room. She pretended to be curious about our argument. We told her. What? Just Happened. Turns out she was my wife's best friend. I suddenly noticed her shoe one was dirty. I instantly understood she was behind all this. But I didn't expose her. After my wife left, I stopped her. I said I needed her help. Then I picked up a dress. I said I wanted to secretly gift it to my wife. I asked her to try it on. She happily agreed. She had no idea. She walked right into my trap. She couldn't zip up the dress. She asked me to come in and help. I pretended to help with the zipper. My other hand quietly reached for her phone. I would give her a taste of her own medicine. She noticed and tried to grab the phone. I walked out with her phone. I was about to send photos to her lover. The commotion brought my wife back. My wife saw what she was wearing. What are you doing here together? He barged in on me. What? It's absolutely not true. Calm down. You understand everything in the moment. Siri, send this photo to my. To my husband. What are you doing? Explain yourself right now. Your friends trying to set me up. Now I'm doing the same. It's serious. Send this photo to. To my love. It's your own fault.

She said since everything was exposed, she didn't want to hide their relationship anymore. Hearing this from them, I was completely done. I can accept it. But you choose to betray me behind my back? No, it's. It's cruel and unfair. Honey, our marriage is over. No, no, no.

Yet what if I told you a man has lived through three entire centuries without dying? This Tibetan monk, believed to be nearly 300 years old. Old has stunned the world with a lifespan no human has ever recorded. Hidden deep inside a cave in India, he was recently discovered and rushed to a hospital where doctors could hardly believe their eyes. His body showed no signs of disease, his organs worked perfectly, and his heartbeat with strength weighing only 30 kg. He walked on his own, spoke clearly, and remembered events from centuries ago as if they happened yesterday. His past is just as extraordinary. In 1770, while still young, he abandoned society, retreating into the icy mountains to live in silence and meditation, rejecting every worldly desire. Researchers now say his secret lies in a mysterious form of sleep, a state so deep it allowed him to pause the flow of time itself, stretching life far beyond natural limits.

Then she drew out some blood from her body, dropped part of it near the sofa on the floor, and just a few drops near the door. She mixed the remaining blood with water, ported over the torn nighty. Once everything was set up, she wore the nighty and lay down on the sofa as if unconscious. After a while, the landlord quietly entered the room, his shoes stepping onto the bloodstain. When he saw the blood soaked woman on the sofa, his face turned pale with fear. He wanted to call the police, but then he remembered he had been secretly spying on her. Panicking, he ran away. Once her plan succeeded, the woman got up and set up her camera, taking photos of her unconscious state, then cleaned up all the blood stains, making it look as though the landlord had tried to erase the evidence. After finishing everything, she calmly left. But the landlord wasn't a fool either. He quickly called two other tenants, pretending he wanted to show them the room so he could later claim he had nothing to do with what happened. But just then, a loud scream echoed through the house. He rushed into the room, only to find that there was nobody at all. The woman had vanished. In fact, the man was actually a real estate agent who often Secretly observed women. But this time the woman taught him such a terrifying lesson that he would never dare to do it again.

Three women were trapped under the roof of a convenience store, the acid rain eating away at everything around them. Too terrified to take a single step forward, they were on the verge of losing all hope. Just as despair set in, Sarah spotted a PMP plastic bottle, their last chance. As soon as the rain let up a little, Nina rushed to place the bottle outside, then quickly dashed back to shelter. After five long minutes, the bottle had collected enough acid. When the traffic light turned green, they had just 45 seconds to move to safety. Mia grabbed the bottle and sprinted towards a nearby phone booth. She poured the acid onto the metal lock and the chain melted away instantly. Her team opened the door in a flash. Mia grabbed the phone just before the countdown ended. But strangely, the receiver emitted no sound. Only 20 seconds were left. Then Mia noticed something, a clue hidden in an image. She ran toward a nearby taxi, but there were only three seconds left. In that crucial moment, Nina saw an umbrella and threw it to Mia. The umbrella shielded her for just a few seconds right before it began to collapse. But just in time, the taxi door opened and Mia jumped inside. The acid rain paused for a moment, giving the two women in the phone booth a chance to dash toward the taxi to escape the downpour. But in the final instant, the taxi doors locked automatically and the phone booth door slammed shut once more. The acid rain was about to start falling again.

The moment he stepped onto the aircraft, the man caught a strange scent. Again, he focused, took a deep sniff, and immediately realized there was a bomb hidden inside the cast. Without panic, he calmly told the flight attendant to alert the captain that a terrorist with a bomb was on board. The captain was skeptical, asking how he could be so certain. The man quietly explained that he had figured it out through his sense of smell. The captain thought he was insane. To prove he wasn't lying, the man revealed a secret. He said, just minutes ago, the captain and the flight attendants had been laughing and having fun in the cockpit. Faces had turned white and they fell silent shortly after. Thanks to his nose, the man saved everyone on the plane. After landing, he received a call from his wife telling him their son had been caught smoking at school and that he needed to meet the principal right away. Rushing to the school, the principal explained that his son and some other kids had been smoking behind the garage and showed him a pack of cigarettes as evidence. The man picked up the pack, sniffed it lightly, and said it didn't belong to his Son following the scent, he tracked down the real supplier. He picked up a bag from the ground and asked, is this yours? The boy remained silent. Calmly. The man turned the bag upside down and a pile of cigarettes spilled out. He simply said, here's the real supplier, and quietly walked away.

Daisy rockets to 75 miles per hour, yet the pursuer matches her move, reading parallel alongside her vehicle. Witnessing these dangerous tactics, Daisy unleashes a stream of curses. What's your problem? Just pass me. Already seeing the truck maintain position, she reluctantly low and yields. Thoroughly shaken by the encounter, though pressed for time, she resolved to stop attempting passes, simply trailing the truck at reduced speed. The pace remains maddeningly slow, feels safer until the trucker, noticing her restraint, waves an invitation for her to proceed.

He silently counted down five seconds in his mind and miraculously the plane stabilized. Ethan, it turned out, was a reborn individual, a former ace pilot. In his previous life, during an award ceremony, he had been killed by a falling chandelier and now he was reincarnated in this boy's body, retaining the memories of his past life. He knew the real danger was only beginning, so he strode toward the cockpit, explaining the cause of the accident to the steward, discarding it. She, however, assumed he was causing chaos. Ethan ignored the warnings, entered the password and opened the cockpit door. The stewardess was stunned as The two pilots teetered on the brink of death with the plane hurtling towards snowcapped mountains. In that critical moment, Ethan swiftly poured a pot of water into a vase.

And the moment I finished, it's started raining outside. I opened the window and realized only the area I sprayed was raining while the other side of town remained clear and sunny.

By morning, the restaurant had a brand new color and the owner was stunned staring at the bright new facade.

He quickly climbed ashore and picked a fruit to eat, then ventured deeper into the island through dense forest. He spotted a group of meerkats by crystal clear pools. Overjoyed, he leapt into the water and swam with a band, so thrilled to be alive that all his pain melted away. The tiger was equally ecstatic. This place felt like paradise to him. The boy calmed himself, tying his girlfriend's necklace to a tree branch as a keepsake. With plenty of food around, he decided to stay a while. But danger soon forced him to reconsider. At sunset, the meerkats scrambled into the trees, panic stricken, and the tiger, sensing something wrong, ran back to the lifeboat.

When everything was prepared on their wedding anniversary, she staged the crime scene during her husband's absence. Perfect the scheme, she frantically wrote 300 diary entries, fabricating stories from their romantic period, creating a brutal and convincing marital narrative, betraying her husband as a cheating monster while painting herself as a long term abuse victim. Finally placed the diary in the oven, slightly charred to simulate her husband's evidence destruction.

She had her brother seal the coffin completely with wooden planks, plunging the tomb into complete darkness. Annie switched on the camera, activating night mode, ready to record whatever would unfold. Legend has it that those who commit evil in life must face divine judgment in death, buried in their grave. But today, Annie was determined to challenge that superstition. She spent a full two days inside the coffin, yet the corpse beside her remained motionless. As the experiment neared its end, Annie prepared to rest when suddenly an invisible hand gripped her neck, making it hard to breathe. Desperately, she screamed for her brother, but he was sitting by the tomb, smoking, unaware of anything. Terrified, Annie looked up at the air vent and saw a poisonous snake slowly slithering in. Her heart raced as the snake inched closer, and she felt as though her heart might explode from fear. Just when she thought it was all over, the snake veered to the side, crawled onto the corpse, and slowly slithered into its mouth, shivering uncontrollably. Any quickly turned, raising the camera to focus on the corpse. In the next moment, the body emitted a strange sound, and then an unbelievable scene began to unfold.

Next he said the heat to 200 degrees. Thirty minutes later, he opened the chamber. This method could shrink a person 2,000 times instantly. Created to address Earth's population pressure, the doctor invented a miniaturizing system able to reduce an adult to 10 cm. This would dramatically ease overcrowding crisis.

Just as she was about to speak, the elevator blasted an overload alarm, and the elegant woman slowly turned toward her. She didn't want to admit she was the reason. After comparing their figures, she quietly stepped out. The alarm kept. Another lady assumed the elevator was broken and walked out with her. But when she stepped back inside alone, the alarm went dead silent. She invited the other woman to join her, but the woman stormed off in anger. Trying to take a photo to show off her curve, she accidentally split her skirt. Her own body fat had betrayed her. The elevator was about to stop, so she grabbed a cardboard box and shoved it over her head to avoid humiliation, only to walk straight into a proposal scene. The man upstairs mistook her for his fiance and fired an arrow toward the bouquet, triggering a sudden shower of petals. No one realized she was violently allergic to pollen, so she bolted immediately. Just then, the man opened his arms for a hug. She dodged on instinct, and the arrow shot straight into his backside. The poor guy collapsed in agony.

Anyone who doesn't look like this is regarded as ugly. Anna has loved her mother's face since she was a child. She drew many paintings of her mother and set her mother's face as the goal she would strive for when she grew up. When she grew up, Anna was very dissatisfied with her own face. In order to become beautiful, she went to a plastic surgery hospital with her best friend. Anna showed the doctor her mother's paintings, but the doctor told her that if she wanted to look like that, it would cost a lot of money. Since Anna didn't have much money, she had to leave the hospital. In the evening, the whole family was having dinner. Anna looked at her family members, all with high noses and big eyes, and she envied them very much. Anna proposed to have plastic surgery, but her mother refused on the grounds that the family had no money. Anna went out feeling downcast, intending to pour out her grievances to her best friend, but when she saw that her best friend had already had successful plastic surgery, she felt even sadder. Anna went to the street alone to relax and accidentally bumped into a man. When the man saw Anna's appearance, he showed a look of disgust, which dealt a heavy blow to Anna. At that moment, an advertisement on the wall caught Anna's attention. It was a free plastic surgery hospital and anyone who signed up could experience the latest plastic surgery technology. Eager to become beautiful, Anna immediately went to this hospital. After learning about Anna's demands, the doctor confidently assured her that he would make her the most beautiful woman in the world. Anna did not hesitate to sign the agreement and went to the operating table. When Anna woke up again, as the doctor removed the bandage, she found that she had really become a beauty and was very satisfied with her face. However, all this was just Anna's fantasy. Anna actually had a failed plastic surgery. Anna wrapped herself up tightly and returned home. At this time, her family also noticed her face.

Not worth much, but I kept it anyway. Little did I know, the real surprise was yet to come. I just answered a phone call and the penguin was gone. Then I heard a squawk behind me and realized I was in deep trouble. The penguin had come to life! I picked up the little guy, and he immediately gave me a fragrant welcome gift. I quickly dumped him in a basin with ice and rushed off to work. The second I left, the penguin turned on the faucet and had himself a pool party. When I got home and opened the bathroom door, my face was exactly like that third emoji on your phone. I was so pissed, I grabbed the penguin and tossed him out. Get lost! Just as I was heading downstairs to grab some food, the receptionist stopped me. Your penguin got loose, but I caught him. I denied it was mine, but then she pulled up the security footage. I called animal control trying to get rid of the penguin, but they all turned me down. But wait, it gets better. The next day, another package arrived. I thought finally I could ship the penguin away, but when I opened it, five more little guys came waddling out. Great. Just kill me now. My place was total chaos, and the doorbell rang. It was my ex wife with the Kids for a birthday visit. My son saw all the penguins and thought they were his birthday present. He was over the moon. Even my daughter, who'd been giving me the cold shoulder, cracked a smile. The doorbell rang again. It was the zoo people I'd contacted earlier. But with these penguins, I could finally reconnect with my kids. So I had no choice.

If you're feeling unsure about anything at all, you can always ring a neighbor's doorbell. The litans live there. The sea landers there. They're the bum gardeners. Let's skip that house. Whenever our recycling bin overflows, I put it in theirs. They've caught me like three times. Got it. Okay. Let's say a van pulls up and a very nice person says he has your favorite type of candy and invites you inside. What do you do? Does he have pop rocks and a cat? Kidding. I do what you taught me. No. Go yell. Tell. I say no. Run away as fast as I can. Yell my head off. And then tell Chestnut adult. Good. And that goes for anyone stopping to ask for directions or offers to give you a ride or ask you want to get in their car and pet their puppy. How cute is a puppy and a cat? Kidding. You guys are too easy. Okay. Well, so the library is just right up there. Easy peasy. Easy peasy. Okay. What's your info? Phone No. 2, 0, 3, 5, 5, 5, 0, 1, 4, 5. Address 23 William, Westport, Connecticut. 0, 6, 8, 8, 0. Perfect. Okay. Trial runs over. You go back to the house. I'm ready to go it alone.

The next moment, their son rushed to stop his mother, but his father pulled him into an embrace. Soon after, the young white master emerged and the son asked his father what he planned to do. In response, the father helplessly muttered a single word, which was overheard by the white master. Shortly after, the black man was dead. Seeing this, the white master's mother hurried over, ordered someone to bury the body quickly, and then approached the young boy to speak with him. From then on, the boy was taken into the house to serve, and he diligently attended to every white person there. Years flew by, and Cecil bowed at his father's grave before telling his mother he was. She didn't respond, as she hadn't spoken a word since his father's death. He then turned to an elderly woman, who lifted his head and tucked a book into his chest without saying anything.

In that era of racial discrimination, it was hard for a black man to get a job. Suddenly, a cake in a shop window caught his eye, and as he stared at it, he broke the window and climbed in. The loud noise alerted the hotel manager, who found Cecil eating the cake ravenously. Fortunately, the manager didn't demand compensation. Instead, he bandaged Cecil's wounds and offered him a job. That's how Cecil found work, and the manager taught him many service skills, emphasizing that he should make every guest he served leave with a smile. One day, a black manager told Cecil to work at a

Aunque sus cuerpos seguían acostados en la cama, sus almas estaban atrapadas en una luna virtual tejida por un braindance. Este es también el origen de la escena icónica de cyberpunk. Con un simple gesto, el alma fue arrebatada. El joven david sucumbió ante la seducción de una belleza, pero nunca podría haber imaginado que aquella mujer de pelo blanco que paseaba con él por la luna, al momento siguiente, lo vendería directamente a la mafia local the folk, solo porque david tenía el sun devistan que ellos querían. Sin embargo, este era el último recuerdo que dejó la madre de david ya instalado en su propio cuerpo. No hacía mucho tiempo, cuando david llevó el sun devistan a un médico de implantes, este le advirtió. Ese tipo de implante era como una bestia salvaje imposible de controlar para un simple novato. La instalación era posible, pero con condiciones. Si algún día david moría o quería quitarse el san de vistán, el implante pasaría a ser propiedad del médico. Dicho esto, hizo que david se acostara en la camilla. Apretando los dientes, soportó el intenso dolor que venía de su espalda hasta que la instalación se completó. Default. Después de todo esto, inmediatamente buscó al compañero de clase que solía acosarlo de una patada. Lo tiró de la silla y después le asestó un fuerte puñetazo. En ese momento, el chico de pelo azul no pensó si las cámaras lo grabarían En un instante, activó todos sus implantes, comenzando el ataque. Sus puños, como una tormenta, pasaban frente a david sin tocarlo. Pero para david, todo esto parecía moverse en cámara lenta. La trayectoria de cada golpe era claramente visible. Sin darle tiempo a reaccionar, david simplemente se movió para posicionarse detrás de él y golpeó con fuerza su cara. La velocidad fue impresionante. El golpe no solo mandó volando al de pelo azul, sino que también le rompió el puente nasal. Incluso así, seguía gritando amenazas de que su padre expulsaría a david. A estas alturas de la situación, david ya no se preocupaba por la expulsión. Era joven entonces, sin imaginar que los regalos del destino ya tenían un precio marcado. En el momento más oscuro de la vida de david, una mujer que cambiaría su destino para siempre apareció repentinamente. Su primer encuentro fue en un tren. En ese momento, lucy utilizaba sus habilidades de hacker avanzadas para robar información personal. Al principio, david no le dio importancia, ya que estos incidentes eran comunes en night city, hasta que lucy cambió su objetivo hacia él. The folk fue el primer fracaso de lucy, pero no parecía avergonzada. Arrastró a david a un rincón apartado. David quedó aturdido, sin tiempo para reaccionar. Lucy lo sujetó firmemente. Tras escanearlo, descubrió que un simple chico llevaba un implante militar. Pero no denunció a david, sino que sugirió que trabajaran juntos. David aceptó sin dudarlo. Necesitaba dinero para pagar el alquiler. Su Colaboración fue perfectamente sincronizada. Lucy usaba sus habilidades informáticas para expulsar el chip del objetivo. David utilizaba las capacidades del sun devistan para actuar velozmente. Sin embargo, cuando llegó el momento de repartir el botín, david se desmayó sin previo aviso. Según el médico, fue por uso excesivo del implante. Bastaba con inyectar inhibidores regularmente. Desafortunadamente, david, sin experiencia, no sabía qué eran los inhibidores. Lo que nunca hubieran imaginado es que el médico clandestino, al ver el implante militar instalado en david, desarrolló una codicia por poseerlo. Pero lucy no era fácil de manipular default. Resulta que el médico sin escrúpulos pensaba que david no duraría ni un día. Por eso no le proporcionó suficientes inhibidores para el periodo de adaptación. Pero cuando escuchó que david había usado el implante 8 veces en un solo día, quedó realmente sorprendido. Para una persona normal, usarlo 2 veces al día sería suficiente para colapsar mentalmente. Aunque desconocía qué tenía david de especial. El médico le recomendó no usarlo más de 2 veces al día, porque aunque el cuerpo pudiera soportarlo, la mente posiblemente no. Pero aún así, esto no disuadió a david de seguir usando el san de vistán. Necesitaba urgentemente dinero. Lo ganado con lucy se gastó en medicinas e inhibidores. David afirmó que podía seguir trabajando, pero lucy se negó. No quería cuidar de un psicópata cibernético. Sin embargo, al enterarse que por impago del alquiler se había quedado sin hogar, lucy decidió llevarlo a su casa. Era la Primera vez que david visitaba el hogar de una chica para disimular su incomodidad. Bebía cerveza constantemente sin percatarse que lucy notaba perfectamente su nerviosismo. Ella bromeó pidiéndole que se quitara la ropa tifold. Solo era porque encontraba su ropa demasiado anticuada. David contraatacó, burlándose de los viejos y anticuados pósters de lucy. Sin saber que había tocado un punto sensible, david intentó explicar que la luna real no era tan maravillosa como la publicidad mostraba. Como estudiante en la academia, arasaka conocía muchos secretos internos. Cuando la compañía decidió desarrollar la luna, incontables personas sacrificaron sus vidas. Más que un paraíso terrenal, era realmente un infierno que enterró a innumerables trabajadores. Pero lucy no prestó atención, burlándose de que david, como niño rico de arazaka, sabía demasiadas cosas para su propio bien. David confesó que había perdido a su padre de pequeño. Unirse a los estudios arazaka tras graduarse, era el sueño de su madre. Ella trabajaba día y noche para que david recibiera la mejor educación en cuanto a lo que david quería, nunca se lo había planteado. Entonces lucy decidió mostrarle su propio sueño. Sincronizó su brain dance con david. Quizás la luna era un infierno para david, pero era el lugar donde lucy soñaba escapar. Incluso podían sentir en el brain dance el calor abrasador. Default. Era la primera vez que lucy traía a alguien aquí, la primera vez que compartía sus sueños con otra persona. Ni ella misma sabía por qué, tal vez por compasión Hacia david

A steel cable sliced straight through the crowd on the dance floor, cutting everyone in half. Only a little girl survived simply because she wasn't tall enough. Elsewhere, a rescue ship's radar suddenly picked up a cruise ship out of nowhere. But when the sailor looked again, the ship had vanished from the screen. Just as everyone thought it was a radar glitch, a massive cruise ship appeared right in front of them. The captain read the name along the hull. It was the Antonia Grazha. But the Grazha had vanished back in 1962 without sending any distress signals. After repeated attempts to contact it failed, the captain decided to board the ship for investigation. The upper deck was well preserved, though it leaned slightly forward, probably because the lower cabins had flooded. Once inside, the crew tried to joke around to ease their nerves, but the captain quickly silenced them. He had heard noises coming from deeper inside the ship. Haha. Shut up. Let's go find the bridge. Such a manly man. What? What? All right. Shut up. Come on, Mary. Let's go.

But the black man explained that he just wanted to return the bag. The white CEO didn't believe him, and security was alerted. The CEO's shouts also attracted the police. The black man quickly hid inside a building as he anxiously tried to evade capture. Inside, more and more police arrived. He was eventually found. Though he explained that he only meant to pick up the bag and return it, no one believed him. They were absolutely convinced he was a robber. Just like that, the unlucky black man was taken away. Little did he know, after he was taken, his faith began to quietly change. Two wealthy men who witnessed the incident made a bet about the black man. The older billionaire believed the man became a thief because of his environment. If he were given the chance to be a corporate CEO, he would manage the company well. If the white CEO had nothing, he would end up on the streets as a beggar. But the younger billionaire disagreed, arguing that the white CEO was a Harvard graduate. Even with nothing, he could start a company. The black man, however, would remain a beggar for life. After arguing, the two super wealthy men decided to make them swap identities and lives. And just like that, the fates of the beggar and the CEO were changed by a $1 bet. So when John went to attend a meeting, someone arranged by the billionaires bumped into him and slipped money into his pocket. Then during the meeting, that person claimed his money was missing, and the money was found on John. Poor John didn't even have time to explain before he was taken away by the police.

Oh, my god, what did you just do? Oh! But the boy didn't seem to care. However, that night, while the boy was sleeping, all the worms in his fish tank crawled out and began to burrow into his body. The next day, the boy was eating, but he suddenly didn't like the taste of the food and threw it away. He began to look for food in the garbage. Later, he was pushed down a flight of stairs at school, but he was completely unharmed. Looking for a thrill, the boy rode his motorcycle to the top of the school building, intending to ride it down the stairs. This drew the attention of the entire school staff and student body. Despite everyone's attempts to stop him, the boy rode the bike down, ultimately breaking an arm. But he simply pushed it back into place and the bone reconnected. The girl was watching all this, and she could see the worms writhing inside his body. The boy told her he Was looking for more exciting games. The girl believed he had been possessed by some kind of worm, so she found the boy's mother, and the two set out to stop him. When they arrived, the boy was about to ride his motorcycle off a cliff. As they were about to stop him, his stomach became racked with intense pain.

The deserter's feet were shackled, with the other end of the shackles nailed to a rock. His teammates left him only a few bullets and a small amount of food. His mission was to stop the Soviet soldiers. As soon as his teammates left, the soldier aimed his sniper rifle at them, but they had already disappeared into the forest. His top priority was to free himself from the shackles. In a moment of desperation, he raised his sniper rifle and pulled the trigger. The intense pain made him cry out in agony. The iron chain was too thick. He couldn't break it. He could only search his backpack and found a pair of glasses. He had an idea. He carefully took out the lenses and put them together. Then he broke a pine branch, scraped off the resin with his knife, softened it in his mouth and stuck it to the edge of the lenses. He inserted another pine branch and poured some water into the gap between the two lenses, creating a makeshift magnifying glass. Next, he placed some dry moss on the iron nail and used the lens to focus the sunlight on the moss. Soon, the moss caught fire. The soldier quickly collected dry branches to make the fire burn brighter. After the branches burned out, he poured cold water on the rock. The sudden temperature difference caused the rock to crack. He tried to pull out the nail. But it still wouldn't budge. He didn't give up and repeated the process. The nail slowly became more exposed. Not long after, a large hole appeared in the rock. With a few more attempts, he would be able to pull out the nail. Around noon, the soldier was squatting by the rock, eating from a can, when he suddenly heard the sound of an engine in the distance. He immediately grabbed his sniper rifle and looked. It was a Soviet military vehicle passing by, fortunately.

The robber then went back to assault the woman while the passengers continue to watch, seemingly entertained. Three minutes later, he pulled up his pants and left.

Sensing trouble, the chef splashed a bowl of oil onto the floor, causing the customer to slip and fall. With the evidence gone, the customer had no choice but to storm out. The chef then rushed into the kitchen, gulped water straight from the pipe, and when handed a bottle of pesticide, he sprayed it into his mouth. Just then, a health inspector suddenly arrived. The owner panicked, but two rats jumped onto the table. He quickly trapped them under a bowl, but the scraping noise drew the inspector's attention. In desperation, the owner pretended to dance to cover it up. Then another rat leapt onto the table. The chef joined in, slamming bowls down while twisting his body. Moments later, rats began dropping from the ceiling one after another, and the staff scrambled to trap them under bowls, wriggling as they moved. The inspector turned around to see the entire room twisting bizarrely in unison. Just as he was about to leave, yet Another rat fell from the ceiling. The inspector lifted a bowl, and the rat sprang out at his face.

He wished to be an ordinary person, but instead he accidentally blew his parents into clay figures. As he grew older, his superpowers became even stronger. If he overslept, he could reach the office in a single second. If he wanted snacks, he just shook the vending machine and the snacks fell out automatically.

He rushed to the center of the tracks and spread his arms wide. The next second, the train driver watched in complete disbelief.

He told me the ones floating were bad, only the ones sinking to the bottom were good. So I immediately took out my notebook and wrote it down. Mike then realized I was there to learn his tricks. He reached out asking me for money, but I had no money at all because I had my eye on an automatic Chestnut roasting machine. It was expensive, but it was easy to use and even better than roasting by hand. So I spent all my funds on the machine. Seeing I had no money, Mike told me to leave. So I went off, disappointed, to find another teacher. Then I started learning skills from different places. I found a few mentors and finally mastered the technique. After many tests, I produced a decent batch. My family tasted it and they all loved it. So I rented a shop in a mall and quickly set up my stand. But I still had classes to attend, so I asked my uncle to run the stand for me. I thought the business would boom, but on the first day, we didn't even make enough to cover the electricity Bill. So I asked my uncle why we earned so little. He said maybe he wasn't as cute and sweet as the girl at the other stall. So I asked him to try attracting customers more actively. But the next day he didn't sell a single box. I had no choice but to learn from other vendors at the market. Soon, the donation box at the restroom caught my attention. People coming out of the restroom always tossed in some spare change. That was when I realized how important the location was. So I immediately asked them all to change my spot. I even offered to pay more just to move next to the parking lot. That way people would pick some up on their way out. Sure enough, once I changed spots, business exploded. Chestnuts were selling like crazy. Then I calculated the numbers. One store made a profit of $120,000. So with 10 stores, I could make 1.2 million a month. I rented every prime location in the mall. But then my mom brought bad news. My dad had failed an investment and owed a huge debt. They were planning to move abroad, but my business had just taken off and I didn't wanna leave. So I chose to stay behind, starting my business alone in the city. But not long after, I received a notice from the mall. The machine was producing too much smoke and had stained the ceiling. So the mall decided to remove all my stalls. In the end, the entire project failed. I was depressed for a long time until one day my girlfriend asked me out for dinner. In the car, she handed me a box of fried seaweed. I didn't expect it to taste amazing. The more I ate The more I wanted, it was so good I couldn't stop. And that's when a new business idea was born.

After countless attempts, she finally realized she was a ghost. The house she once knew was no longer her home. New tenants came and went. They couldn't see her, but they could sense her presence. Old house. She thought she'd be trapped forever in an unnoticed corner. Until one day, a boy her age moved in. Like the other tenants, only the family pet first noticed her presence. But then, while taking off his shoes, the boy accidentally triggered a hidden compartment in the cabinet. Out of curiosity, he opened the red photo album. First page bore her name, and the yellowed photos looked vintage. Before he knew it, he'd flipped to images of her as an adult. He used to live here. Huh. Yet the back pages remained empty. As he flipped back, the album suddenly snapped shut. Unaware it was the girl's doing, he assumed the album was faulty. As he turned the pages, a ring fell silently to the floor. The next morning, the stinging pain under his foot LED him to discover the ring. Its gem seemed enchanted, drawing him to slip it onto his finger. Oh, is that the relic of the. Fuck? What? The boy couldn't believe it. Thinking he was hallucinating, he put the ring back on. Oh, my god. You just saw me, didn't you? You just saw me. You. Such an eerie scene made him extremely frightened.

At the beginning of the competition, the fans ordered 80 donuts for the two of them. The bestie was also a big eater, and she quickly polished off the donuts.

She couldn't say no. He suddenly felt his whole body heat up and was thrilled. So he decided to protect the inmate, Lisa. Lisa often got bullied in prison because she refused to join either the black gang or the white gang. Turning to the warden for help seemed like her only option. With his Protection, Lisa started gaining confidence. Whenever someone tried to mess with her, she fought back, even forming her own crew. One day, Lisa's crew got into a fight with the black gang. Guards rushed in and broke it up, locking them in solitary. When the warden found out, he immediately released Lisa and called her into his office to discipline her. But Lisa was tired of living like this and wanted to break free from his control, especially since he'd started making her do illegal stuff. She began rejecting his advances. Without his Protection, Lisa got bullied again. When the warden visited her in the infirmary, his hands started sliding up her thigh. A nurse saw everything and tried to help Lisa. Lisa was touched, but the moment they hugged, the warden saw it on the security camera. He immediately sent someone to silence the nurse forever. Lisa was terrified. The next day, it was finally her chance at Parole. The warden told her if she obeyed him, he'd make sure she got out. Desperate for Freedom. Lisa agreed. But at the hearing, the warden suddenly accused her of starting fights in prison. Lisa didn't panic. She pulled out a recording of his heavy breathing. That moment became the warden's biggest humiliation. Soon.

I'm not giving you any money. Greg, when we leave, you can lay your coat over a puddle. I'll use my birthday money. How's your cheese? Bye. Bye, butter. Thanks, Dolores. Keep me coming. Here we go. Papa needs a good grab. So did your parents say what time they were gonna pick you up? It depends what time they get back from Kentucky.

On one, my family, on the other, the ranch. I can only save one. I used to think that meant that one couldn't be saved. Then I realized it only meant that I couldn't save. My ancestors came here, land sold for $1. 25 an acre back when it was your land, even though you didn't sell it. That's what it's sold for when they took it. And that's the price I owe for you under two conditions. East Camp I keep for my family. And you can never develop the Yellowstone and you can never sell. We can't sell our land, Casey. We have lost it. Forbidden. Is your sister okay with this? She's okay with it. I made a promise to your father once that I would one day have this land and I would return it to the state. That man found it. That would remove any evidence that he had been here. I'm sure he took it as a threat. And at the time, that's how I meant it. But your people are buried in that land and so are mine. What's this here? That's the carve out for the 5,000 acre parcel. The Yellowstone will be declared A wilderness area, nothing can be built, no motorized vehicles, no bicycles, can only be traversed on a horse or your own two feet. Congratulations. You just made the worst land deal since my people sold Manhattan. But look at Manhattan and what it's become. Then look at your ranch. It'll never change. Thank you for the sacrifice and for saving it.

The maid beside her stood frozen in fear, for her entire family was hiding under the table. Fortunately, after dinner, the lady went upstairs. The maid quietly urged her family to sneak out while they still had the chance. Suddenly, the homeowner's daughter appeared at the foot of the stairs. Turned out, the little girl wanted to camp on the lawn that night. In that moment, the hiding family quickly crawled under the sofa, narrowly avoiding being seen by the wealthy household. But a new challenge awaited them. How would they escape? Now? The daughter had settled comfortably in her tent outside, while the rich couple relaxed on the living room sofa above them. The hidden family held their breath, not daring to make a sound. When the couple finally drifted off to sleep, the family carefully slid out from under the sofa, towed toward the garage, and slipped out through the back door of the villa. As the saying goes, a heavy rain reveals the true gap between in rich and poor. The wealthier you are, the higher you live. While the poor family descended downhill, swept along like debris toward the depth of the city's drainage system. When they finally returned home, the shock was overwhelming. Their modest basement home had been destroyed, the water level rising to their waists, and dirty water gushed endlessly from the toilet. Yet the little the tent of the rich family outside remained untouched. Not a single drop touched it. It was as if some lucky charm had shielded them from the storm. Staring at the ruins, the eldest son silently vowed, no matter what it take, he would climb into the upper class one day and give his family the life they truly deserve.

She urgently called her husband, but he was immersed in work and didn't notice. A subordinate pointed out the incoming call, yet he angrily demanded the phone be silent. With no alternative, she contacted her sister in law who was too far away to help directly. Sister in law immediately called a friend asking him to take Anna to the hospital. They assumed everything would be fine there, but Anna's amniotic fluid had fully drained and the fetus had its umbilical cord wrapped around the neck. The doctor recommended an immediate C section. When asked for a family member to sign the consent form, the friend clarified he wasn't a relative. Any further delay, however, would endanger both mother and child. Left with no choice, Anna signed the form herself. Worried about Anna, the young man quickly called Lisa, Anna's sister in law. Hearing that Anna had no family beside her, Lisa dropped her tasks and rushed to the hospital. After arriving, she repeatedly called Anna's husband again with no answer. She then contacted Jack's superior, a woman who had always harbored feelings for Jack and deliberately tried to prevent him from visiting his wife. As they argued, a vice president overheard the female superiors conversation. Meanwhile, Anna's condition grew critical.

That's me. Twin pistols on my hips. That's all the introduction I need. I boarded that long distance bus with a lock steady enough to make people nervous. There was a wanted man on board, and I had already marked him. But I wasn't in a rush. Gave him one last chance. Hand over the goods and I'd make it quick. But the fool didn't know what was good for him. His hand crept into his bag, reaching for a shotgun. Did he really think I wouldn't notice my gun was faster? By the time I reached him, he was already lying in a pool of blood, gasping for air. His lips moved, wanted to say his last words. I bent down to listen. Nothing but threats. Said his brothers would come after me. Yeah, whatever. I went through his bag and found some of the goods. Not everything, but enough. You do this job long enough, you learn killing one more is just a matter of pulling the trigger of times. Then I headed to the drop point and set up an ambush. Just me. And I had all those bounty hunters surrounding. My message was simple. Hand over the money. They all chickened out, dropped their guns on the ground. I savored that feeling of watching them submit. Turned around and headed inside, ready to count my cash. That's when the muscle man jumped.

So he lost his father during 9 11. He was evaluated to be suffering from severe emotional disturbance problems and visiting the memorial turned out to be a huge trigger for him. Now, the memorial itself has two drops. The first outer rectangle is 30 feet tall and has water running over the side. The inner rectangle is another 20 feet drop leading down to a pool of about 18 inches of water. This 33 year old first flung himself over the first 30 feet drop, causing a head wound and leaving a blood trail in the water. That's when all lookers noticed and started to record him. He can then be seen lying on his stomach looking into the second rectangle for sliding in and falling head first for another 20 feet. Luckily, he survived and was rushed to the hospital with only a broken leg. When he was being rescued by the firefighters, he said to one of the men that he did this for his father. The entire structure has limited guards and nothing preventing people from doing this. Just last year, another man had to be talked off the ledge after he too was planning to jump.

No solo eso, descubrió que todo podía calcularse con fórmulas. Cuando vio el partido de fútbol del colegio, apareció un cursor bajo los pies de los jugadores. Cuando pasaban el balón, aparecía una parábola amarilla, incluso con precisión hasta el ángulo. Esta escena mágica hizo que el niño se emocionara mucho. Entonces pidió inmediatamente unirse al equipo y el entrenador le dio una oportunidad. Pero a diferencia del niño confiado, sus compañeros no confiaban en este niño delgado y frágil. Tan pronto como entró al campo, le pasaron el balón, el chico lo atrapó y rápidamente estudió el campo. Descubrió que el lado izquierdo era la mejor opción. Cuando se preparó para lanzarlo, el ángulo apareció delante de él. Ajustó un poco y lanzó tal y como indicaba la fórmula. Todos se quedaron sorprendidos. El entrenador dijo rápidamente, no importa lo loco que hayas hecho, justo ahora has ganado este puesto. El niño se alegró al escucharlo. Mientras tanto, su padre también empezó a despertar. Su padre era un policía. Un día, un criminal una pistola de la policía e intentó disparar a su compañera. El hombre se abalanzó hacia delante de inmediato.
