Surprisingly, the ball moves on its own. The final score matches his prediction. It turns out he can pause time. He moves the ball while time is frozen, just like stop motion. The man is an animator, but he was hassled by his boss for being too slow. The boss orders him to finish within an hour. Then he accidentally rubs a magic lamp a few times. An ugly genie flies out. Jesus! Hey! No! He offered to grant the man any wish. I wish I had all the time in the world to finish animating this shot. The genie used his power to steal all the world's time, condensing it into a purple button. Even earth stopped spinning. Press the button to pause time. Press again to resume. The man controlled time. First, he froze time to prank his boss, ran into a homeless man on the street. Then he pressed the button to help the homeless man perform a difficult move, forcing passers by to applaud. Finally, he put all the money into the homeless man's hat. He took the money to the supermarket. There, he suddenly spotted a man and a woman. He wanted to create a scene of love at first sight, so he repeatedly froze time. Eventually, he even ripped out the man's heart instead of pressing the button. He rushed the man to the hospital, but the doctors were frozen too, so he had to teach Himself medicine to perform the surgery. After years of study, he began operating. He stitched the man back together, then restarted time. Oh thank god! He brought the man back to the supermarket. After time resumed, the people in the control room were shocked. The man returned to his company filled with regret. He decided to confess everything to everyone. He turned his experiences into a video and played it on the screen. But then time froze again. The button also stopped working. Then the genie warned him that pausing time requires a price. He will be trapped forever in the paused world with no escape. Finally, the genie destroyed the button and departed.

But she accidentally dropped the phone on the floor. As she reached down to pick it up, her towel slipped off and the phone's burst mode kicked in, snapping a bunch of photos of her body. When she picked the phone back up and looked at the screen, she was horrified to find that all the photos had automatically been sent to her boyfriend. Panicked, she jumped on her bike and raced towards school. On the way, she hit a rock, which made the bike go out of control and speed down the road. Luckily, her tire didn't blow until a cat suddenly ran out and punctured it. Just as she was freaking out, she saw her grandma driving by, so she hopped in the car, but it was moving slower than a snail, so she grabbed the wheel and took off down the highway. In just two and a half seconds, she made it to school. At that moment, the boy was about to check his messages and the girl was sweating bullets. Fortunately, the boy had to get to class, so he put his phone in his locker. The girl rushed into the locker room and quickly styled her hair to look like his, easily fooling the locker's facial recognition. But the phone slipped and fell again, right into the hands of The boy who had just come back. Just as he was about to check it, a kitten suddenly darted in, snatched the phone, and deleted all the photos. The girl finally breathed a sigh of relief, grateful that her boyfriend never saw the pictures.

She opened the box and immediately a mission from her superiors came through. Turned out that just the day before, the weapons from the agent headquarters had been stolen. Without wasting any time, the woman switched into her combat gear, canceled her leave and prepared to carry out the mission. Using satellite tracking, quickly arrived at a remote island, uneasily pinpointing the thieves location. What puzzled Lisa was that the mission seemed too easy. The thieves were swiftly dealt with, but neither of them knew that they were being secretly watched. The whole operation was actually designed to lure them away from the agent headquarters. Seeing the plan succeed, mysterious woman slipped something into a drink. She disguised herself as a delivery person and made her way to the agent headquarters. With her seductive figure and captivating face, she easily passed through security checks, flipping unnoticed into the headquarters. Once inside, she handed over the prepared drinks and pizza to the on duty staff. Soon everyone there fell unconscious. Seeing this, the woman went straight to the other woman.

While feeding the chickens, another maid got caught in the window, also shaking violently. This strange behavior piqued Peter's curiosity.

That night at bedtime, his sister wanted to sleep with Peter, but head maid intervened, stopping them during the pushing and shoving.

I'm just trying to lighten the mood. It's not that serious. Being polite. Also, why are you so obsessed with us? If we wanna lol, let us lol. You don't like our lol, then stop texting us. Honestly, it's just muscle memory at this point. Like first it was the millennial pause. Now it's the millennial LOL. Like they're literally mad at us for our over usage of the word LOL. Can you imagine? It's like they're so bored they need to find things to be mad about. Imagine being offended by somebody laughing out loud. So let us live lol.

We can't even decorate our homes without being criticized. Listen, we've come a long way. We used to decorate with empty liquor bottles and Christmas lights on top of our kitchen cabinets, with a crusty pleather couch that some family member was giving away for free. We grew up in houses that looked like the inside of a Cracker Barrel. And if you were rich, the inside of an Olive Garden, fake grapes and little tiny fat chefs. And if you were really rich, the inside of your house looked like a Cheesecake Factory. I'm talking faux columns, baby. The amount of clutter we grew up with in our childhood homes made us wanna be sterile, made us gravitate to plain millennial gray. My parents saved every paper utility Bill they've ever received, every Bill. My whole life is on auto pay. We don't want clutter. Our brains are already cluttered enough. So if we want our houses to look clean and sterile and boring, let us.

I held up the screen. I own it. Silence. Brad's smirk melted. Mom blinked. Belle looked shocked. I built it. I licensed our product to three hedge funds last year. One is your firm. I've had three meetings with your department heads. You weren't in any of them. Brad was pale. I didn't mention it because you treated everything I did like a joke. You own a tech company, mom said. Since three years ago, you never said anything. Would it have mattered? Brad stood. I didn't know, right? Because if you did, you wouldn't have said half of what you said. I'm selling it. The deal closes Friday. You're what? Mom gasped for how much? Bell asked. Enough. I walked out. The next days were silent. Friday came, signed the docks. The number didn't feel real. Then bell texted. We talked. She apologized. Mom's freaking out now. She notices I booked a trip, two weeks alone. When I got back, a wedding invitation waited. Bell and Brad. Mom's note, family is everything. I called a friend in cyber security. Two days later. He said to file. Brad had job hopped constantly, bad investments. More importantly, he'd been running a crypto scheme promising returns that never came. My sister was marrying a con man. IRS, VPED. Yes. Wedding day came. Short ceremony, then reception. I waited. Just as dessert was served, I stood. May I say a few words? Brad smiled tightly. I'm happy for bell. You look beautiful. She blinked. Brad, I wasn't sure about you, but I've done some homework. Dug into your background, your investments. Brad stiffened. I'm just here to tell the truth. I pulled out my phone, connected it to the projector. A PDF appeared. Investor communication records, credence coin 2021 to 2023. Then screenshots, then a recorded zoom pitch where Brad promised guaranteed returns. Gasps. Brad's been running a Ponzi scheme for two years, I said calmly. Dad went white. Belle stood clutching her bouquet. Roy, what is this? What I tried to tell you, he's not who he says he is. Brad moved toward me. I've already submitted this to the SEC. This, it's just a courtesy. His face drained. No one in this family wanted to believe I could be right. I was told to stop making the family look bad. I looked at mom. Her hands trembled. But today I chose truth. Belle, you deserve better. I walked out. Brad was detained. Belle annulled the marriage in under a month. My parents went silent. A blank card arrived. I tossed it. Some doors closed themselves.

Her dog sat nearby, tilting its head in confusion. Just as Amy was wrapped up in her daydreams, front door suddenly opened. Her mom had returned unexpectedly, catching Amy off guard. Amy quickly adjusted her clothes and rushed to her desk, pretending to be deeply focused on studying. The moment her mom stepped inside, she immediately sensed something was off. She asked why the phone was lying on the floor. Amy nervously explained that the dog had knocked it over, then quickly grabbed the leash and took the dog outside. While out walking, she unexpectedly ran into Aaron, the guy she'd secretly had a crush on for ages. Even though it was just a casual encounter, Amy couldn't help but see it as a special, almost magical moment. But then Aaron suddenly said he had to go. He casually mentioned that he'd be having a birthday party next and invited Amy to come hang out before the big night. When the party day arrived, Amy carefully dressed up, determined to look her best. Second Aaron saw her, he was completely captivated. Later, they stepped outside together, their eyes meeting in a shy, lingering gaze. Both overjoyed, Amy rushed tell her best friend about what had happened, only to be shocked when Aaron later denied everything in front of everyone. Humiliated and heartbroken, from that day on, gossip spread like Wildfire through the school and classmates started get.

What rumor? I looked up confused and reached for my phone but remembered it had died on the bus that morning. The entire classroom went silent. Kids who were talking suddenly stopped mid sentence. Everyone was stealing glances at me, but whenever I made eye contact, they'd quickly look away. This one girl, Arlene, in the front row, was actually crying while looking at me. But for some reason the boys were laughing. Miss I O Connor shifted uncomfortably and adjusted her glasses. I'm not at liberty to discuss the rumor with you. I really suggest you speak with the counselor. My heart started racing because something was seriously wrong. Whatever this rumor was, it had made my teacher look at me like I was made of glass about to break. I grabbed my dead phone and my backpack and headed for the door. I needed to find my best friend, Kaylee right now. Kaylee was in Mister Brady's home room down the hall. I knocked and pointed at her through the little window. Mister Brady looked at me with the same wide eyed sad expression Miss O'connor had and immediately let Kaylee come out. That's when I knew this was bad. Teachers never just let kids leave class without a hall pass. The second we got into the hallway, Kaylee grabbed me in the tightest hug. I'm so sorry this is happening to you. Baby, I'm so, so sorry. I started crying without even knowing why. My best friend was holding me like my life was ruined. All I could think about was if someone leaked me. Kaylee just kept hugging me and rubbing my back while I sob.

I looked at my food, I looked at her, and I just said it honestly. No, not this time. I only got enough for me. Her whole face changed. She looked at me like I just told her I ran over her dog. What? I said I only ordered enough for myself. You said you weren't hungry. She sat there for a second, just staring at me. Then she goes, wow, okay. Didn't know you were so stingy about a few fries. It's not about being stingy. You always say you're not hungry and then eat half my food. She stood up and her voice got all high pitched. I don't always do that. Yes, you do. Last week you ate four of my tacos. Those were supposed to be four tacos for me. You ate one and a half of them. Lisa crossed her arms and said I was being dramatic, that it was just food and friends share. But I asked you before I ordered. You said no. She didn't have anything to say to that. So instead she just went, fine, whatever, and walked to her room. Then she slammed the door so hard, our apartment shook. I sat there eating my nuggets in this awkward silence. I could hear her moving stuff around in her room all aggressively, slamming drawers, throwing things. The next morning, she completely ignored me. Walked right past me in the kitchen without saying anything. I Tried to say good morning, and she just grabbed her coffee and left her work. This went on for three days. She'd come home and go straight to her room. If I was in the living room, she'd turn around and leave. Our mutual friend Amanda texted me asking what happened between us. Apparently, Lisa had been complaining to her about how I refused to share my food. Amanda said I could have just given her a few fries to keep the peace, that it wasn't worth fighting over. But that's exactly the problem. I asked Lisa before I ordered. She said she wasn't hungry. Why is it my fault for believing her? If she wanted food, she should have said yes when I asked. Now I'm apparently the bad guy for setting one tiny boundary. Lisa still barely talks to me and makes these huge sighs whenever I'm in the same room. All over some McDonald's fries.

My roommate Lisa and I get along great most of the time. We watch shows together, split cleaning duties. The whole thing works pretty well. But there's this one thing she does that drives me absolutely insane. Every single time I order food, she says she's not hungry. I'll ask her if she wants anything when I'm about to place my order. She always goes, nah, I'm good. I'll just make something later. Cool, perfect. So I order enough food for just me. Then my food shows up and suddenly she transforms into this hovering vulture. She'll come out of her room and be like, oh my god, that smells amazing. Can I just have a few fries? Except a few fries means she takes like half a and somehow my chicken nuggets mysteriously disappear. One time I ordered a burger and she asked for one bite. One bite turned into half my burger being gone. The worst part is she acts like she's doing me a favor by helping me finish my food. Like I ordered too much and she's just being helpful. But I didn't order too much. I ordered exactly what I wanted to eat. So last Thursday night, I was starving after work. I ordered McDonald's large fries, 10 piece nuggets and three containers of sweet and sour sauce because I'm not a monster. Before I ordered I asked Lisa if she wanted anything. She was on her phone and just waved her hand at me. Nope, I'm not hungry at all. Might make some pasta later. Okay, perfect. I placed my order just for me. 20 minutes later, my food arrives and I'm sitting on the couch ready to watch this show I've been waiting for. I open up my bag and start eating. This smell of those fries hits different when you're really hungry. Not even two minutes go by before Lisa comes out of her room. She stops in the doorway and goes, uh, that smells so good. I can already see where this is going. She walks over and sits down next to me on the couch. Can I just have a few fries?

The ropes binding them tightened rapidly, dragging them into the sea. The immense pull of the yacht quickly brought them to the surface and the man tried to break free, but the cunning robber noticed and immediately increased the yacht speed. Worse still, the area was surrounded by sharp coral reefs. In an effort to protect the woman, the man deliberately rolled over, using his back to shield himself from the coral. His back was instantly slashed by the coral and the blood quickly attracted sharks. Seeing the sharks approach, the man twisted his body desperately trying to avoid their attacks. At that moment, the robbers also spotted the sharks in the water. With a twisted grin, the robber ordered his crew to steer the yacht back into the shark infested waters, intending to use the two of them as bait. Suddenly the man noticed the rope was loosening. He knew this was his chance to escape. As the yacht turned, they went back underwater and tied the rope to a rock. Once the yacht completed its turn, the robbers immediately accelerated, believing they had hooked a shark. The man gripped the rope tightly, desperately trying to keep it from slipping off the rocks. The robbers, thinking they had caught a shark, fed up even more. Finally, after the man's relentless efforts, rope snapped under the weight of the yacht in That moment a boy sprang out of nowhere, throwing one of the robbers into the sea. The sharks quickly spotted the robber, surfaced, and began devouring him.

Kelly grabbed the letter. Full scholarship, that's impossible. She's not even honor society. I was rejected from honor society by Mr Brenner. He was the faculty advisor. Said my grades weren't good enough. The grades he'd been tanking. This has to be a mistake. Mr Brenner said, I'll call Cornel myself. Please do ask for Doctor Williams. She interviewed me. You went behind the school's back for interviews. You refused to write my recommendation letter, said it would be a waste of your time cause you're not MIT material. Neither is Kelly. But you wrote her three recommendations. How dare you compare yourself to my daughter, your daughter who cheated on the sat s. Everyone knows she sat next to Tommy Chen and copied his answers. Mr Brenner stood up. Get out of my class. Gladly. I'm done learning from someone who sabotages students. I went to the principal with everything. My graded papers from before and after Kelly lost. The Science Olympiad, the recommendation letter, reduction, schedule change, the mail incident that happened in front of witnesses. The principal called a meeting. Mr Brenner brought Kelly. This is a misunderstanding, he insisted. I've always supported all my students and explained the grade drop. She got lazy. Here's my work. You tell me what's lazy. The principal reviewed everything. Mr Brenner, these grades don't match the quality of work. Sometimes I grade hard to push students. Only her after your daughter lost to her. That's a coincidence. The mail. Incident. I explained that it was junk mail from Cornell with her name on it that you threw away in front of the class. The principal turned to me. What would you like to see happen? I want my grades fixed, my real grades done. Want an apology to the class? He humiliated me in front of Mr Brenner. He mumbled something. And I want Kelly investigated for sat cheating. Kelly screamed, you bitter bitch. Mr Brenner went purple. We're leaving. This is harassment. Principal stood up. Mr Brenner, you're on administrative leave pending investigation. By graduation, Mr Brenner was teaching freshman health. Kelly's sat scores were invalidated. She ended up at community college, actually at Riverside. I gave the valedictorian speech at Cornell orientation, mentioned a teacher who taught me that respect is earned through actions, not titles. Didn't name him. Didn't need to. Everyone from our school knew exactly who I meant.

Some kids aren't meant for college. The letter was from Cornell. Full ride for engineering. He didn't know that part. Just saw my name and tossed it. The whole class saw. Nobody said anything. They never did when Mister Brenner decided someone wasn't worth his time. He'd been my physics teacher for two years to tell everyone I was his best student. That changed when his daughter Kelly didn't get into regionals for Science Olympiad and I did. Must be quotas, he'd said. Then they need diversity. I'm white, just poor. That's when the grades started dropping. Perfect lab work became BS. Tests with all correct answers got marked down for sloppy handwriting. My handwriting hadn't changed. His grading had. You need to be realistic about your abilities, he'd tell me during parent conferences. Trade schools are perfectly respectable. My mom worked three jobs to pay for my AP tests. Mr. Brenner knew that, made sure to mention the test fees whenever she came in. Some families prioritize differently, he'd say. The Cornell letter arrived at school because our mailbox got smashed and mail kept getting stolen. I'd use the school address for all my college applications. Mr. Brenner volunteered to distribute mail to students. I'll make sure everyone gets their important correspondence, he'd promised the principal. That morning, he walked in holding a stack of envelopes. College responses are arriving, he announced. Let's see who got good news. He opened Kelly's first MIT waitlist. Excellent. Waitlist at MIT is basically acceptance. It wasn't. Then he got to mine. Didn't even look at the return address. Just saw my name. Oh, Riverside Community College. How nice. Tossed it straight into the garbage. Some of us have realistic expectations. I stood up. That's from Cornel. Sure it is. He laughed. Kelly laughed. Half the class laughed. I walked to the trash and pulled it out. The Cornel crest was right there on the envelope. His face changed. Well, let's not make assumptions. Could be a rejection. Open it, then read it to the class like you did with Kelly's. That's private. You just threw my private mail in the garbage. I thought it was junk mail from Cornel with my name on it. Mistakes happen. Sit down. Read the letter, or I'm going to the principal. Are you threatening me? I'm stating facts. You opened Kelly's mail without permission. Open mine. He tore it open roughly, probably hoping to rip the letter. Started reading silently. His face went red, then white. What does it say? Kelly asked. Congratulations. He muttered. For what

It wasn't the first time. Every episode of violence was followed by the same act, his trembling apologies, his soft, deceitful promises. Once Anna had been a brilliant attorney, sharp and confident. But for the sake of her family, she had surrendered that world and traded her courtroom victories for kitchen silence. What she received in return was not love, but a cycle of bruises and fear. One morning, after walking her son to school, Anna Learned he had been tormenting other students. Her heart cracked. She saw his father's cruelty growing inside him. Terrified of history repeating itself, she decided to run. Secretly, she rented a small place outside of town, praying for freedom. But her husband found out he always did. That evening, the town glimmered under the lights of a masquerade ball. Anna sat in the passenger seat, every muscle tense, waiting for the storm to begin. She feared the moment he'd pull over, the violence that would follow. But when they reached the venue, he didn't stop. He kept driving, past the music, past the lights, until the car vanished into the dark outskirts. And this time, he didn't raise his hand.

Because somewhere during all of this chaos, we have managed to redefine blackness. It bothers me when I hear large groups of black people and reference to Kamala Harris. A bitch ain't black. She Jamaican. She ain't even black. She Jamaican. She ain't black, she Jamaican. Last time I checked, Jamaican is black. And you can bet your ass that when a police officer, a racist police officer, has his pistol pointed in the face of someone of color, they are not differentiating between Jamaican, Haitian, Liberian, African, or African American. They see we are all a part of the same pigmentation gang, so let's knock that corny shit off. That's why I thought it was funny even during the debates when the moderator called Trump out for saying she wasn't black. I wish she would have took it a step further and be like, you're not Jamaican, you're Indian.

And in that moment, everything clicked. The man he'd been watching for years had been watching him, too. Jack was an intelligence officer assigned to keep tabs on a writer named Tom. His superiors had said it was just another routine mission. But as he listened to their private conversations, doubt began to creep in. In the exchanges between Tom and his girlfriend, Emma, a strange code kept appearing, one that, to Jack's horror, Atched his own identification number. First, he thought it was coincidence. Then came the punch line. It was a joke. Tom already knew he was being monitored. That changed everything. Jack decided to turn the game around. He dug into Tom's past, and what he found made his blood run cold. Tom had once worked for the same agency, now masquerading as a novelist, setting traps for hidden operatives, testing who could truly be trusted. Emma, she wasn't innocent either. Her gestures, her glances looked choreographed, like she was performing for an unseen lens. She knew Jack was there. As Jack dove deeper into classified archives, the final piece fell into place. Tom's real assignment was to expose agents who were ready to betray their own. Camera fades to black. The sound of static fills the air. The hunter has become the hunted.
