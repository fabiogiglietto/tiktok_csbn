When I turned 18, my parents decided I was too comfortable living at home rent free and implemented a new rule. Anyone over 18 had to pay $800 a month rent or move out. We're teaching you responsibility. My dad announced real world preparation. I had been saving money for college while working part time, but $800 would wipe out my savings completely. Dad, that's more than most apartments around here. Then maybe you should get your own apartment. We're not running a charity. Fine. I moved in with my friend whose parents charged me $200 a month for their guest room. But here's what my parents didn't realize. I wasn't just their oldest child. I was basically the live in babysitter, tutor, chauffeur and crisis manager for my two siblings, Jake, 16, and Lily, 12. The first week I was gone, all hell broke loose. Jake called me sobbing. I tried to make dinner for Lily and burned down the kitchen. What were you trying to make? See, aerial. But I thought you had to cook it like oatmeal. He put a plastic bowl of cereal in the oven. The smoke alarm was still blaring. Then Lily got on the phone. I'm stuck in the washing machine. She climbed in to arrange her stuffed animals properly. The fire department had to extract her. Week 2, Jake tried to give Lily a bath and flooded the entire upstairs because he Didn't know you had to turn the water off. Lily was floating around the bathroom on her inflatable unicorn while water poured through the ceiling into the living room. Jake tried mopping with the vacuum cleaner. It exploded and electrocuted him. He had to go to the er. Why didn't you use towels? I asked? What? Our towels? Jake replied. Seriously? Week 3, Jake decided to take Lily to school himself. He got lost for four hours and ended up three towns over because he followed the wrong school bus. I thought all yellow buses went to the same place, he told the police. By month 2, my parents were dealing with two children.

My neighbor, Mister Smith, disappeared for three months and came back paralyzed from the waist down. I later found out he had served three months in Afghanistan. The contractor's truck was already there to install a ramp. Absolutely not, Karen said, popping up out of nowhere. This violates Section 3.2 of our architectural guidelines. All exterior modifications require 30 days notice and board approval. Maria, Liam's wife, was shaking. Karen, he literally cannot get into his house. He's paralyzed. Karen finally looked at Liam in his wheelchair. Hospital band still on? Well, that's what apartments are for. Maybe this neighborhood isn't suitable for your needs anymore. The contractor tried to reason with her. Ma'am, it's just a temporary wooden ramp. We can match whatever color. Are you licensed and bonded through our approved vendor list? Karen interrupted. When he said, no, she smiled. Then you're trespassing. I'm calling the police. Liam wheeled forward. Karen, please. I just got home. I haven't seen my kids in two weeks. He actually bent down to his level, condescending as hell. You know, I find it interesting that you were walking just fine at the Memorial Day barbecue. Now suddenly you need special accommodations. My jaw dropped. She was actually accusing a paralyzed veteran of faking. I have his medical records right here, Maria said, pulling out paperwork. Karen waved her hand dismissively. Anyone can forge documents. I've seen plenty of R words pretend to Be disabled for special treatment. That's when things got bad. Liam tried to wheel himself up the front steps. Fine, I'll do it myself. But wheelchairs aren't made for stairs. On the second step, he lost his grip and the chair started tipping. I lunged forward, but couldn't catch him in time. He crashed backward onto the concrete driveway. The sound was horrible. Metal and flesh hitting pavement. Liam cried out, clutching his back. Maria screamed and ran to him. And Karen? She pulled out her phone and started recording. Everyone see that? He moved his legs. I knew he was faking, but he hadn't moved his legs. It was just his body convulsing from the pain. Tom from next door came running. I'm calling 9 1 1. He already had his phone out. 9 1 1, yes, we have a paralyzed veteran who fell from his wheelchair. Karen marched over and shouted loud enough for the dispatcher to hear. This is a false alarm. I'm Karen HOA, president of Willowbrook Estates. This man is faking his injuries for sympathy. He's an actor, not a veteran. Tom stared at her in disbelief. Are you insane? He turned back to his phone. No. Please send an ambulance to 1547 Oak. Karen grabbed for his phone. I have legal authority over this property as HOA president. This is a non emergency. Cancel the ambulance. Karen, call an ambulance! For his acting performance? I don't think so. She was still filming. Liam was Turning pale, sweat pouring down his face. My. My medication! He gasped. It's inside the nerve pain. Maria was sobbing. He needs his pain meds every four hours or the damaged nerves feel like they're on fire. Please, just let us get him inside. Karen lowered her phone. Nerve pain. How convenient. What's next? Emotional support? Peacocks? More neighbors were gathering now. Jenny, the nurse from two houses

So my parents kicked me out. Now eight months later, they're begging for money. I'm a 21 year old nursing student who until recently lived at home with my parents and older sister Madison, 25. For two and a half years, I've been working weekends at a medical clinic while going to school full time, saving everything I could for my final year of nursing school and the licensing exams. The work is exhausting, but I've managed to save about $15,000. My family has always treated Madison like she could do no wrong while I was held to impossible stand. It's growing up. If Madison failed a test, it was the teacher's fault. But if I got a B+, I was being lazy and disappointing them. When Madison dropped out of college after one semester because formal education stifles creativity, my parents said she was brave for following her own path. When I chose nursing over premed, they said I was settling for less and wasting my potential. Madison has been finding herself for years, jumping from one failed venture to another, photographer, life coach, yoga instructor, each lasting about three months before she got bored. My parents funded every single one without question. Her boyfriend Dylan has been around for about a year and somehow makes Madison look responsible by comparison. He claims to be a crypto trader, but mostly just watches YouTube videos about getting rich. Quick problem started three weeks ago when Madison saw me checking my banking app while paying for groceries. Two days later at dinner, she announced her latest dream coming a travel influencer. My parents were immediately supportive, asking about her content strategy and brand partnerships. Madison hadn't thought past buying a good camera and flying to Bali. Then she turned to me and said, lucky for me, my little sister has been hoarding money that could launch my career. She knew exactly how much I had saved and told our parents I had tons of money just sitting there doing nothing while she needed it to invest in her future. I explained that money was for my final year of school and board exam prep courses. My mom actually said, but Madison needs it now. You can always take out loans for school like everyone else. My dad added that since I've been living rent free, the least I could do was help my sister achieve her dreams. This LED to a week of pure hell. My parents would corner me constantly and I was selfish that Madison had already told people about her travel blog and I was humiliating her by not supporting her. Dylan started making passive aggressive comments about how some people think they're better than their own family. The breaking point came when my parents sat me down for an intervention. They said either I give Madison at least $10,000 immediately or I needed to find Somewhere else to live. My mom actually used the words, this house doesn't have room for selfish people who don't understand family values. That night, I quietly packed my essentials, took all my important documents, changed all my passwords and left while everyone was asleep. I stayed with my friend from clinical rotations before finding a tiny apartment with three roommates. My phone wouldn't stop buzzing with messages ranging from how could you abandon your family to Madison is crying every day because of you. I kept minimal contact, just letting them know I was safe. I threw myself into school and picked up extra shifts. I started dating Ben from my pharmacology class, who's been amazing through all this drama. For months, Madison kept posting about fake family and people who don't support women's dreams. Then last week, my mom called sobbing at eleven PM she could barely speak through the tears, just kept saying emergency and please come home. After I left, my parents felt guilty and.

Now he regrets everything. When Jake knocked me up at 17, he laughed, actually laughed, said my parents will kill me if this ruins my baseball scholarship. Within a week, his entire family moved three states away, ghosted me, blocked me, vanished like a coward in a Letterman jacket. But I wasn't going to be a statistic. My parents were furious but weirdly supportive. They helped me finish high school online and I gave birth to my son Tommy over Christmas break with jingle bells playing in the background. Cute, right? Tommy and I basically grew up together. I worked three jobs while getting my nursing degree. Mom watched him when she could. We ate so much ramen that he thought it was a food group. We lived in a tiny shoebox apartment with a couch I bought off Craigslist for $15 and dreams duct taped together. But it worked. By the time Tommy was 10, I was a pediatric ICU nurse and he was this funny, smart, ridiculous little human who made life fun even on two hours of sleep. Then I met Daniel. Daniel's a pediatric surgeon, smart, kind, didn't blink when I told him I had a 10 year old. On our third date, Tommy had a cold and Daniel brought over soup and comic books. I think I fell in love right then. Two years later, we got married and Daniel adopted Tommy. Tommy calls him dad like he was born to Because honestly, he kind of was. We had twin girls three years ago and Tommy is the sweetest big brother. Straight a student, star pitcher for his high school and I mean star college scouts come to see him. Then last month, his team made it to the state championships. I was screaming my lungs out from the bleachers, phone in hand, filming every pitch like a full blown stage, mom. That's when I saw Jake. Same face, just older. He was staring at Tommy like he was.

For whatever reason. My f roomie was out with her friends so they took it out on me. My three housemates were wildly lusty. You undoubtedly know from reading my posts the three of them can fund me whenever they want. One arrived last night when I was watching reels in my room. He said he would be quick and to keep doing what I was doing since he was harkey. He entered me and caressed my back while I scrolled Instagram and read it for gloom. It felt great, like maximum stimulation lol. He promised and arrived in my cat shortly after. Give me before leaving. The next person entered after five minutes. Can't remember if I put my shorts back on. After saying my cat was clean, he slipped into me and fun me without asking. Though he didn't massage me, it was pleasant to focus on my phone. My cat was messy and full of milk and he quickly joined in. My cat felt and sounded like I was full of milk and not done. He probably waited outside for my last roommate to finish funding me before he came in. That sloppy cats I was hilarious. I was so excited I heard our other roommate come home while hammering me. My door was open when she came over to watch me being funded and wait before leaving to fetch her belongings. In her room, the third guy pie me and say, did you sprinkle yet? When I informed him I didn't, he promised to fix it and return quickly. After leaving, he reappeared with my female roommate who had just got home. I spread my legs and he grabbed her hair, adding cat needs you. She didn't sprinkle yet. I made her suck and eat me from behind while shoving her face into my triple pie cat. He kept smashing her face into me till I come out. As she left, I saw her face was soaked in her cheek head sealant. After the kiss, I tasted milk from the man and her. The place was a mess.

One. I was over at the apartment of a woman I liked and asked to borrow a shirt because mine was dirty. She said, here, use this one and took off the shirt she was wearing. She wasn't wearing a bra. She threw it at me and then kept talking to me for a few minutes with glass cutters out before going to the bathroom to have a shower. Two. I used to go skinny dipping in the river and at the local hot springs with a bunch of friends in high school. Some of them were pretty spicy. That's how I Learned to look without staring. Three. Back in college, of course, I had a roommate senior year. He had a pretty serious GF that slept over regularly. Apparently she slept in the UAE. There were a few times she would come out of the bedroom to grab a snack. Completed. Eight. The first few times I stumbled over my words, but she didn't care. Four. A friend and her husband have a cabin in the woods and nudity is becoming more and more regular when me and my Bf are there. Usually in the hot tub and sauna. Five. At a house party in uni, a friend of mine comes into the bedroom I'm staying in and gets down to just boulder holder and drawers and says we're sharing tonight and gets into bed as the little spoon. We went on to have a friends with benefits situation a few months later, and I asked if she was trying to fun time that night too. Apparently she was just tired and wanted to cuddle. Six. I was like 10 and getting my haircut by the hot barber with huge lady lumps. She happened to get a tattoo on her chest. I asked about it and she decided to show me. Big old lady lump, flop right out.

My name is Anita and I'm 18 years old. So I'm going to put my family situation aside for now and share my story. So when I was 16, I had to spend a night at my uncle's house. He was a tall and very muscular man and I always liked him tbh, but nothing structurally to this point. Anyway, I didn't want to sleep alone and he told me I can come and sleep with him. He said to go and shower and come to his room and not to feel embarrassed. I was embarrassed. I put my little Nike Pro dress on and went to his room. To my surprise, he was just laying there and watching corn on the tea. He didn't try and hide it or anything. We just both pretended that is nothing. But honestly, my heart was beating so fast and I wasn't sure about sleeping there. I laid next to him, turned my back to him and tried to sleep. But then he started shaking the bed and turn the volume of the corn really up. All I could hear was women screaming their stuff like yes, daddy pound! And much more crazy things. After about 10 minutes, I tried to sleep, but I just couldn't. So I just pretended to be asleep and turned around because I was curious. I opened my eyes a little bit and saw his huge magic wand. Pulled out his Pocket. As he was rubbing it, he was looking on my cherries. And then he put it, this magic wand into my cat very fast.

I was at the grocery store when I saw her. She was pushing an empty stroller after leaving her kid at daycare. We started casually chatting and she was extremely flirty. Since it was my day off, I invited her for coffee to my place, which is in the same building as the grocery store. Coffee was not even ready when she came onto me, pulled down my shorts. Since my legs hurt a lot and I couldn't do it myself. She started savagely eating my pickle. Her level of desperation for fun was remarkable. She was hungry for pickle. She stopped eating, took off her pants, bent over the table, and offered me her wonderful cat. She got loudly as I went in, and once I was deep down, she surprised me with an instant oh! And it was so extreme, her whole body shook as if she was cold. 10 months, she said. Ten months since my piece of trash husband last had fun with me, she said. I felt bad for her, but before I could think anything else, she continued undressing. I really could not understand how a man could not want to have fun with her. I'm sure she gained a few pounds from pregnancy, but her deep blue eyes, her soft skin, her large melons, her wide hips and big behind made her a dream. She ended up staying for most of the day to explore And do everything. She let me give her a cream pie that I had baked earlier. And she ate my pickle. She swallowed and even had an intense O moment while swallowing. I played with her cat. I slapped her behind and left a handprint. Later we showered together and that was the end of it. Maybe she just used me. But I hope she calls again.

I'm only filming with you. And other women you wanna get with. So no other men? Nope. I think you made me jizz. Huh. I have to be the luckiest man alive. There's one thing my fans want, though. Sure. Anything. They want me to put a strap on and peg you. Wow. I'm not the luckiest man in the world anymore. You at least kiss it after? Yes, baby. I'll nurture it after. We can do it then. You are the best. But I get to get with your mom whenever I want after this, right? Yeah. She wants our house to be free use whenever my dad is not there. At least this is the life I've always dreamed of.

My husband asked two of his friends to come over. As the friends of my husband stood in front of me with their corns, I couldn't help but feel a little creepy. There I was about to put both of these hard corns in my mouth at the same time. Knowing that my husband was watching. It was something I had never done before. But before they could say anything, I. I reached out and wrapped my hands around both of their corns they had at the same time. Following that, I slowly put my lips on one of them and took as much of it as I could before quickly moving to the other one. I didn't even think about it. The couch next to us had my husband sitting down and I could see his eyes on me. I didn't care, though. Giving both of these guys the best work I think they had ever had was the only thing that mattered right now. I kept moving my lips up and down along their corns while rubbing them with my hands at the same time. Soon I could feel each of them getting thicker. Eventually, they both got so excited that they jumped up and kissed my face. As the last few drops fell on my tongue, I couldn't help but smile at them. It had been an amazing event for all of us. I knew that this was the start. Of more fun to come between the three of us as we stood there after it was over

My professor's hot. Insanely hot. I never miss any of his lectures. Because missing it means I miss seeing his gorgeous face. He's a young professor, only a few years older than me. I think about him whenever I do the deed. And have tried avoiding dating. Because I want him to know I'm available for him. I've gone to all of his office hours and tried to make as much physical contact as possible. Then the dry spell happened. My professor went on vacation for a week. A whole week without the hottest human being alive. I could have cried. I was infatuated with him. Obsessed, even. I just wanted him. He came back and I scheduled a private meeting with him. I told him it was super important, and he agreed. I decided to wear the sltiest outfit I could find. I was on a mission, and that mission was to bang him. I got there and got to seducing. I could tell. He tried his best not to look at my breasts. But my top left nothing to the imagination. And he just couldn't look away. I was straightforward with him and told him I wanted to sleep with him. He chuckled and said he could tell. And if I could just lose it right then and there. I practically jumped across the table and sat on his lap. He kissed me and F me everywhere in his office. It was The hottest night of my life. My attraction to him only grew deeper. And I f him whenever I could. I could tell he was sore in class. It made my ego inflate to see him struggle to teach because of it. He kept looking at me and got flustered. I never had the fantasy of sleeping with one of my teachers. But now that it happened, I couldn't stop. I was addicted to him. This dragged on for months. I didn't know if I wanted to keep this relationship purely physical. Or if I wanted to date him. The idea of him with another woman made my stomach turn. But dating is a big commitment. And the teacher student relationship makes this much more difficult. Should I date my professor or keep things casual? You would want to date this man if you saw how he looked.

As my hips brushed up against something hard behind me, I felt him tense up. Wait, already? I'm just getting started. You're this excited already? I asked in a teasing whisper, hardly believing it. I could feel his warm breath on the back of my neck. He muttered a curse, hands gripping my waist to hold me still. But he didn't hold tight enough to actually stop me, so I pressed even closer. A tipsy me wasn't usually the type to flirt, but here I was, practically taunting him. Slowly I started moving my hips, feeling the growing situation in his pants. The air around us thickened. I couldn't hold back any longer. Even with my vision blurring, I turned to face him. I was taken aback. This guy was towering. I blinked, trying to focus on his face. My chest was already pressing against his hard torso, but somehow it didn't feel close enough. He was looking down at me, jaw clenched, like I was some pesky little mouse who dared to wander into the lion's den. Dark, perfectly shaped brows, a sharp nose, and those deep blue eyes that could make your knees buckle. My gaze drifted to his tempting red lips. I'd seen my share of handsome models, but this man had something that made you forget everything. Time, place, all of it. Can I kiss you? I blurted out shamelessly. His Gaze darkened, and as he pulled me closer I gasped. His left hand cradled my face, lifting it so I looked straight into his eyes. You're just drunk, he murmured. For a moment I felt like I'd lost myself in seeking his approval. A sense of frustration bubbled up in my chest. Was he rejecting me? I didn't want to be rejected. My hand shot to the back of his neck, pulling him down to me. As my lips found his. I swear I heard fireworks in the background. The second our lips met, his whole body went rigid. Damn it, woman, you have no idea what you're doing! He growled, before kissing me back with just as much intensity with every deepening kiss. I couldn't

I lost a bet with my hubby. I lost a bet with my hubby where I agreed that I would have love with him anytime he wanted for a whole week. It was a wild week. It started on a Saturday morning and he took full advantage. The first time I woke up before him and was in the kitchen making us breakfast, came into the kitchen wearing just his boxers and lifted my robe and pulled my panties down, forcing me to remove them and throwing them to the side and saying that I would not need them this week. He wouldn't let me stop cooking as he banged me from behind and played with my. He ended up busting his loads in me and told me to keep the robe on for today since he liked the easier access. A few hours later, I was doing chores when he came into the room and whipped it out in front of my face. Knowing what he wanted, I started slurping him until he eventually bent me over and went to Pound Town. I never did something like this before, but it made me feel like a woman doing her feminine duties and I loved it. I loved pleasing him this way. He ended up freaking me eight times that first day. During the week he ended up freaking me in all kinds of wild places, like on a video. Call with my boss in my office, at work, in the woods, on a hike, in a park, and even on a bus. He would also use a remote control vibrator when we're in public. It ended up being really hot and helped our love life a ton. Even though the bet was over. I say yes to make love way more and always try to be ready even when I'm not in the mood, because with a few strokes in, I'm going to want it.

I'll look after the money for you, but it's mine. He gave it to me. Well, I'm your mother and I'm the boss. You can't just do that. She gave the money to me, not you. If you're broke, just say that. Oh, you really wanna go there? Whose house do you live in? Whose food do you eat? Whose electricity and water do you use? Who buys your clothes? Okay, and you're my mom. That's a basic requirement. I don't have to do anything. I could just put you up for adoption. Over a thousand bucks. Wow, you're such a great mom. You're not old enough to have $1,000. I have bills to pay now. Give me the money before I take it from you. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Okay, fine. But what are you going to buy? Bills? I'm going shopping at the mall, probably going to buy some new clothes, maybe even some shoes or something. I can't wait. What? I thought you had bills to pay. How about you mind your own business? That's my money. Now what I spend it on is none of your business. I'm telling grandma. Good luck, Grandma. Mom took the money you gave me. I knew that. Bitch would take it. But don't worry, I have a plan. We will get that money back. Okay, but how? I've been keeping tabs on your mother for a while now. She has a shoebox with around $10,000 under her bed. We're going to borrow all of her money. On Friday at around eleven PM, two masked men will break into your house. I need you to leave the back door unlocked so they can get in. When they break into your house, they will tie you and your mom up with duct tape and rope to make it seem like a real robbery. Once they steal the cash from your mom's bedroom, they will then give her a super strong sleeping pill. This will knock her out cold for around 30 hours and will also wipe her memories so she forgets anything ever happened. I will pay you $2,000 for your role in the robbery. Three thousand will go to the robbers that helped and I get the rest and we all live happily ever after. What the? I'm down.

Who is this? It's Ethan from school. You gave your number out in class. Oh, yeah. Hello, Ethan. Why are you texting me on a Sunday? Is something wrong? No, I was just wondering if you're friends with my neighbours. Why would you think that? I saw you going into my neighbour's house a minutes ago. Wait, is your neighbour Billy Madison? Yeah, that's him. He sold his house to me. So who was that guy with you? That's my husband. Oh, okay. Hey, missus star. I'm sort of struggling with the stuff you taught in class today. Anything specific you want me to go over? I'm not sure. I don't understand any of it. Well, it looks like you might benefit from us being neighbours. What do you mean? Why don't I come over tonight and give you a private lesson? Wow, slow down, missus star. Don't you think we're moving too fast? That's not what I mean, Ethan. And besides, I see the way you stare at me in class. If I was really coming over to do that, you'd never turn me down. Okay, so when are you coming over? Tonight at seven. I'll bring the textbooks. Hey, Ethan. What's up, Mrs. Star? Did our private lesson help at all? A little. Well, it would have helped a whole lot more if you stopped staring at my melons. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, really? So you don't like my melons? No, No, that's not it. I think they're great. How would you know if you've never looked at them? Okay, fine, I was staring at them, but it's not my fault they were basically in my face the whole time. Can't argue with that logic. Remember, we have a test coming up this Friday. I expect you to pass, since I gave you a private lesson. I don't think I will, missus star. Why not? Ethan, I don't have any motivation to study. You're going out with Layla, right? Why don't you get her to help you? She broke up with me yesterday. Really? You guys seem so perfect for each other. Yeah. She left me for Tyler, and honestly, it's making me too sad to study. Tyler? The football captain? Yeah, that's him. I can see why. He's a total hunk. Thanks for making me feel worse. Sorry. If you felt better, would you be more motivated to study? Obviously. Okay, then. What about a prize for getting an A on the test? What kind of prize? A hot picture of me. Just for you, Ethan. Really? Yep. So not even your husband would see it? Nope. Deal. Hey, Mrs. Starr, have you marked the test yet? I have, and you got an A. Congratulations, Ethan. Thanks. So, uh, did you forget? Forget what? The picture. Oh, right. When my husband leaves for work, I'll take the pic and send it. Okay. I just saw him leave for work. Mrs. Starr, he just left. Wait a minute, Ethan. Okay. Glad you like it. Yeah, but I wish it showed the melons. Maybe next time. One more thing. Would you mind coming over for a private lesson tonight? My husband's going away for the whole weekend. Why don't you come over to my place in an hour instead? I don't wanna be alone all weekend. I'll be there. Comment for part three.

I was having fun chatting in some chat rooms when a woman reached out to me. It was her husband's birthday and she wanted to surprise him with a blowjob from a sexy younger girl. I loved the thought and happily agreed to her plan. While he was at work, she called me over and made me hide in the closet. Once he came home, she immediately took him to bed, took off his clothes, and blindfolded him. This was my cue and while she made out with him, I quietly crept out and took his cock in my mouth. He was a respectable size and freshly shaved, so I licked all over his cock and balls and kissed his tip. I was too focused on his cock and making sure I gave him the best blowjob of his life that I didn't pay. Focus on what he and his wife were talking until finally he filled my mouth with his Cum. When I looked back at him, he had the biggest smile on his face. His wife thanked me for my help and I swallowed his Cum. Said it was my pleasure and to call me anytime. Then I got dressed and left. I was very horny and needed some cock for myself, so I went straight to the nearest hookups house and invited myself in for a quickie. Try not to say the same thing as me if You lose.

So this little misadventure happened about a year ago during the Easter season. A bit of backstory my wife at the time, who is now my ex wife and an active user on social platforms. Honestly, I'm not sure if she'll come across this, but if she does, I'm not worried since we had a prenuptial agreement, my assets are secure and I've moved to a different continent. Suggested around Easter that I spread frosting on my privates to make them look like an Easter egg. She wanted to clean it off on camera as a playful idea. I know it might sound like a fun concept on paper or on video, but in reality, let me tell you, it's a hassle and a waste of food. Especially when she insisted on buying multiple types of frosting, plus food colouring and having it all be the vegan kind, which made it even more expensive. But then to top it all off, after getting everything ready, she backed out and changed her mind, saying it was a silly idea. Yeah, I got a little frustrated, so in a moment of retaliation, which I don't regret at all, I reached out to her younger sister, who had been playfully flirting with me around that time. I asked if she wanted to mess around while my wife was at work that night. It took some convincing, but after assuring her that it'd be our little Secret and that my wife her sister would be gone for hours, she was on board. After taking 15 minutes to spread the frosting on my privates in the pattern my wife had originally wanted, which honestly was both ticklish and kind of amusing as I had to hold steady while applying it, my sister in law got to work cleaning it off. She spent about a minute admiring the design before starting. I have to admit, my wife knew how to make things fun in her own way, but her sister did a pretty good job too. While she was focused on cleaning off the frosting, she didn't ignore that I was feeling pretty spiced up and she helped out with that as well when she could. I could say we did more afterwards, but we didn't. After she finished cleaning off the frosting, she gave me a bit of extra attention until I felt that peak moment. She didn't keep everything to herself though. She just showed me the result before letting it all drip back down. It was a

A woman, on the other hand, will call and text you as many times as needed just to make sure you're okay. Her care isn't about waiting for you to make the first move. It's about making sure you're okay no matter what. A girl will show zero emotion, acting tough or detached. A woman will let you know when something's wrong, communicating her uncertain feelings and emotions openly. She understands that expressing vulnerability strengthens the bond, not weakens it. A girl will say, but I've known him before you. A woman will say, I just blocked him so that you don't overthink. I value what we have. It's about trust, not competition.

I lost a bet with my hubby where I agreed that I would have with him anytime he wanted for a whole week. It was a wild week. It started on a Saturday morning and he took full advantage. The first time I woke up before him and was in the kitchen making us breakfast, he came into the kitchen wearing just his boxers and lifted my robe and pulled my panties down, forcing me to remove them and throwing them to the side and saying that I would not need them this week. He wouldn't let me stop cooking as he banged me from behind and played with my. He ended up busting his loads in me and told me to keep the robe on for today since he liked the easier access. A few hours later, I was doing chores when he came into the room and whipped it out in front of my face. Knowing what he wanted, I started slurping him until he eventually bent me over and went to Pound Town. I never did something like this before, but it made me feel like a woman doing her feminine duties and I loved it. I loved pleasing him this way. He ended up fucking me eight times that first day. During the week, he ended up fucking me in all kinds of wild places, like on a video call with my boss in my office. At work, in the woods, on a hike, in a park, and even on a bus. He would also use a remote control vibrator when we're in public. It ended up being really hot and helped our sex life a ton.

My pee pee is so large I just cannot lug it around any longer. It is so insanely huge and has caused so many problems in my life. I cannot go to airports as they think I'm sneaking something in. So every time I go I get touched as they try to take my pee pee off thinking it's a bomb. I cannot pleasure women as they are so horrified at the sight of my pee pee that they immediately run away. My mother and father disowned me after seeing the length of my shaft. Not only is it extraordinarily long, it is just too thick. I cannot relieve myself as my hands are just too small to choke the chicken. My humongous PP has ruined my life. I resent god for cursing me with this large chunk of meat that just drags across the ground. Doctors tell me I will never be able to get a PP reduction as they would have nowhere to put the PP. It would just take up far too much room. I had a girlfriend when I was a young lad. She loved me for who I was and did not care for this deformity. But one day I took off my jeans and my pee pee flung out, smacking her and flinging her out the window. She died two hours later in the hospital. She was the only woman who ever loved me. My pee pee is just too ginormous. It has caused problems for myself and the people around me. For this reason, I will be ending it all. My pee pee has taken over my life. But it cannot take over a life that does not exist.

Now pay up the $500. No way! I lost it too last night. Give me my money! No you didn't, you liar! I did. Seriously? So we really both lost it the same night? I guess so. I can't believe you managed that lol. Rizz app says you should reply. I don't doubt that you did first. You are the better looking sibling. I don't doubt that you did first. You are the better looking sibling. Oh, that's so nice of you, Clovis. Tell me how yours happened. Okay, so I was at this costume party and met this guy. Wait, a costume party? As in the costume party that Lorenzo was hosting? Yeah. How did you know? Uh, no reason. Continue. So after I met him, he and I had a few drinks and spoke for a while. He checked off everything on the list of requirements. He was above 6 foot, he makes above six figures a year, was even more innocent than me. And he loved Star Wars. He was even wearing a Mandalorian costume. What more could a girl ask for? Oh, shit. What? Nothing. Abigail, please continue. So as time went on, we went over to the dance floor and started dancing together. And that's when I could tell we both wanted to do it. So I went and asked my friend if she had any spare balloons on her, and she did. Then we went up into one of The guest rooms and got straight to it. For some reason, we both kept on our masks. Play into the role play. And it was amazing. He was really good at it too. Even though it was his first time as well. You wouldn't even be able to tell it was his first time. Once we were both done, we went off on our own ways. But I forgot to get his number before he left. Hopefully fate brings me back to him so we can do it again. Now pay me my money. Were you wearing a Chun Li costume, per chance? Yes, I was. How did you know? Oh shit! The Mandalorian guy was me. I was just lying so I could tap the mighty Chun Li. Look, I get that you're my younger sister. But if I'm keeping it a buck fifty. That was fat. Care to increase the world

She asked, what does Ava have that I don't? And you said, better taste. Oh my god. You didn't. I did. The look on her face was priceless. You're impossible. And you're stuck with me.

She's dramatic like that. Well, congrats. You're fake girlfriend now has a nemesis. So this is fun. My mom just asked, when is Jake coming over for dinner? She knows? Of course she knows. You couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you? Actually, I didn't say anything. Then how does she know? Moms have their ways. What did you tell her? That we're busy. Lame. I love your mom's cooking. Jake, this isn't real. Doesn't mean I can't get a free meal out of it. Hey, it's a boyfriend. I've been thinking. Uh oh. Dangerous territory. What if we didn't have to pretend anymore? What are you saying? You know exactly what I'm saying. No, no. Say it out loud.

I'm rich! You mean we're rich. That's our money, son, who the hell even gave you that kind of money? Grandma did. She said it was a treat. I'm gonna buy a PS five. You're just a kid. I'll look after the money for you. But it's mine. She gave it to me. Well, I'm your mother, and I'm the boss. You can't just do that. She gave the money to me, not you. If you're broke, just say that. Oh, you really wanna go there? Whose house do you live in? Whose food do you eat? Whose electricity and water do you use? Who buys your clothes? Okay, and you're my mom. That's a basic requirement. I don't have to do anything. I could just put you up for adoption. Over a thousand bucks? Wow. You're such a great mom. You're not old enough to have $1,000. I have bills to pay. Now give me the money before I take it from you. Five, four, three, two, one. Okay, fine. But what are you going to buy? Bills. I'm going shopping at the mall. Probably going to buy some new clothes. Maybe even some shoes or something. I can't wait. What? I thought you had bills to pay. How about you mind your own business? That's my money now. What I spend it on is none of your business. I'm telling grandma. Good luck. Grandma! Mom took the money you gave me. I knew that. Bitch would take it. But don't worry. I have a plan. We will get that money back. Okay, but how? I've been keeping tabs on your mother for a while now. She has a shoebox with around $10,000 under her bed. We're going to borrow all of her money. On Friday, at around eleven PM, two masked men will break into your house. I need you to leave the back door unlocked so they can get in. When they break into your house, they will tie you and your mom up with duct tape and rope to make it seem like a real robbery. Once they steal the cash from your mom's bedroom, they will then give her a super strong sleeping pill. This will knock her out cold for around 30 hours and will also wipe her memory so she forgets anything ever happened. I will pay you $2,000 for your role in the robbery. 3,000 will go to the robbers that helped, and I get the rest. And we all live happily ever after. What the fuck? I'm down.

Oh, I see. So weddings are now exclusive clubs where personal grudges get priority over family. Got it. Stopa. This isn't about her. Pretty sure it is. Or is there another reason she's banned from the guest list? Does she snore too loudly? Steal cake? You're being ridiculous. Ridiculous? I'm not the one saying real family only while inviting mom's boyfriend. Dad, you're ruining my wedding! Correction. You ruined your wedding by forgetting to include the person paying for it. Can't you just do this one thing for me? Sure. Invite my wife, and I'll hit approve faster than you can say I do. You're impossible. And you're learning that actions have consequences. Fun, right? I can't believe this. Mom is furious, too. She'll be fine. Tell her boyfriend to pay for it. He's real family, after all.

It started in 2006. I had just turned 18 and was enjoying my relationship with my first GF. We'd been together a little over a year when a third person joined our relationship, which she had no idea about. Her mother. My girlfriend and I lived some way apart, so we spent our days off work together, mostly at her place, where she lived with her mum. Occasionally my girlfriend, however, would do a morning shift at work, leaving me at home until she returned. The first few occasions this happened, I would mostly just stay in bed, watch TV, masturbate. The usual stuff to pass a few hours of a lazy morning. Her mom worked from home sometimes, or was off also, so would be downstairs at her desk or doing whatever she was doing. I'd go downstairs, make some tea, we would have a quick chat. Nothing out of the ordinary. Occasionally she would knock on the bedroom and ask if I wanted tea. Of course I would say yes. Who doesn't like tea being made for them? On one particular day, I was masturbating when she knocked the door and asked if wanted a drink. At first I stopped and said yes, please, trying my best to sound like I'd not been pleasuring myself. But then I had a naughty thought. After she had gone downstairs, I went out of the room naked and into hers. Went to Her washing and took a pair of her dirty knickers and quickly took myself back to my girlfriend's room. My cock was rock hard at this point and my heart was beating from the rush of what I had just done. A lacy white thong with the scent of my girlfriend's mother's pussy all over them was now in bed with me. A few minutes later I heard the footsteps coming up the stairs and a knock on the door. I said she was okay to come in and she gave me my cup of tea and we spoke for a while. All this whilst under the covers. I have a rock hard penis with her dirty underwear around it. I think she had an idea I'd been masturbating as I was trying to control my breathing and she said well I'd better leave you to it with a cheeky grin. I smiled and thanked her for the tea and off she went. The orgasm that followed he leaving the room was mind blowing. Her used panties helping me to cum very quickly.

I thanked and complimented him and continued to prepare breakfast for him. Remained close to me and kept hugging me. We decided to sit on the sofa to eat breakfast together. I was wearing a short skirt. When I went to turn on the TV, my son joked, mom, you are so beautiful. How can I have a wife like you in the future? He rested his head on my shoulder and hugged me. I smiled and said he was cute. As I crossed my legs, he stroked them and said they were beautiful. I kissed his forehead and said I was happy that you complimented me like this.

I can hear my sloppy wimp as I bounce up and down. My thighs burn, but the thought of the knife keeps me going. I try to bring myself to another orgasm, but I never can in this position. It's always just out of reach. He grabs my hips and forces me up and down on his pee pee, and I hope he's enjoying the view of my SS from behind. I wish I was better at writing so I could make him see m this way. Then it's back to the window. He pinches and pulls at my nipples, making me see m again. My wimp is so over stimulated at this point. I ask him to spank me, craving the pain, and he spanks me hard. Despite the forcefulness, I'm far enough into subspace that I feel no pain, only pleasure. He stops too soon, but I soon forget about that as he enters me again, dragging me by the nipple, so I'm bouncing on his pee pee, standing up. My nipples burn as he f's me again, and my brain is empty, thinking about nothing except how amazing he makes me feel. My tongue is out and I can see my reflection slightly in the window, and seeing how SLT I look makes me even more turned on. Sometimes I'm embarrassed about how much of an exhibitionist I am, but not today. I Absolutely love being a SLT masochist w H re, and I'm so grateful I have someone who I can be that with and who is constantly pushing my limits and giving me endless amounts of pleasure. He pulls out of me and tells me to get on my knees, so I immediately do and open my mouth ready for his cm. He C m s all over my mouth and t t s and then forces me to clean his P P. Once done, he forces me to clean the cold C m from his hand, which is gross, but I willingly and eagerly do it anyway because I love how filthy it makes me feel. I'm so far gone into the pleasure that there's not much I wouldn't do. He needs to clean himself up and I stay on the floor for a while as I come down from the high. That is incredible intimacy.

It's embarrassing, but I was so worked up and desperate for his PP that I came immediately as he put his PP in me. He keeps pounding me through the pleasure and I'm seeing stars with how amazing it feels. He's going rough, pounding me, deep spanking my SS and it's incredible. I only wish I had some clamps to hurt my nipples as my TTS sway back and forth. Occasionally he pulls out of me and pushes his pee pee against my a hole, threatening to ignore my hard limit of anal. I get scared wondering if he's actually going to force his pee pee inside of me, but part of me wants him to do it. His pee pee is wet enough for my juices. My heart races faster as I wander. I would have been satisfied if our session ended there, but he tells me to get up and get in front of the window. The position isn't the most comfortable, but the act of being such a SLT and the thought of being seen sends sparks to my wimp and I want to see M again. He starts effing me hard as we watch the people below. A girl passed near our window and I tried to hide, but he pulls me by my hair so my bouncing TTS are displayed as he uses my a hole. I was so scared wondering If she'd look up and see me, my tongue out and panting, but I'm so turned on that I can hear my juices. It's humiliating, but that only turns me on more. I feel like such a W H R E, and it's incredible. I wish more people would walk past to see me. I lose track of how many times I see m in this position. It's just wave after wave of s L T. Pleasure, and I can't think of anything better.

My f roommate was out with her friends so they took it out on me. My three housemates were wildly lusty. You undoubtedly know from reading my posts, but the three of them can fund me whenever they want. One arrived last night when I was watching reels in my room. He said he would be quick and to keep doing what I was doing since he was jorkay. He entered me and caressed my back while I scrolled Instagram and read it for gloom. It felt great, like maximum stimulation lol. He promised and arrived in my cat shortly after thanking me before leaving. The next person entered after five minutes. Can't remember if I put my shorts back on. After saying my cat was clean, he slipped into me and fun me without asking. Though he didn't massage me, it was pleasant to focus on my phone. My cat was messy and full of milk and he quickly joined in. My cat felt and sounded like I was full of milk and not done. He probably waited outside for my last roommate to finish funding me before he came in. That sloppy cat sound was hilarious. I was so excited I heard our other roommate come home while hammering me. My door was open when she came over to watch me being fond and wait before leaving to fetch her Belongings in her room. The third guy pie me and say, did you sprinkle yet? When I informed him I didn't, he promised to fix it and return quickly. After leaving, he reappeared with my female roommate who had just got home. I spread my legs and he grabbed her hair, adding cat needs you. She didn't sprinkle yet. He made her suck and eat me from behind while shoving her face into my triple pie cat. He kept smashing her face into me till I come out. As she left, I saw her face was soaked in her cheek head sealant. After the kiss, I tasted milk from the man and her. The place was a mess. I appreciated it, especially the massage.

I, 42 m, have been single for five years since my partner passed away. My daughter, 26F, came home to visit while she thinks about moving back to my town. I have since moved into a small one bedroom apartment, so there was no real room for her, but she's only staying two weeks. I haven't seen her in over a year, even though we talk every week. She and I are very close. When I picked her up from the airport, my heart raised. We held hands an entire drive home. Having a woman in the house again felt really good. I had a list of chores for her to do and she started almost immediately. I told her I wanted to thank her for her work, and she suggested we go out to a nice restaurant. I was excited since I mostly cook at home for myself and it has honestly been a few months since I've been on a date. I got dressed and we went to a nice Italian restaurant she picked. She was so attentive the entire night. It was sweet, and when she suggested I have another glass of wine, I didn't hesitate. We went for a short walk after dinner and I hung off her arm and we talked about her boyfriend. It was the happiest I've been in a while. When she drove us home, she grabbed my hand and held it, initiating The contact. When we got home, we talked more and she massaged my shoulders and then neck. It was heaven. I realized that I was enjoying being touched too much and excused myself saying I was going to bed. I went to my room and put a towel on my bed and got comfortable. I was about to stroke myself, but my daughter walked in. She then saw me obviously exposed. She then started smirking. Press share and more for part two.

We had saved ourselves for marriage, so we were both virgins, so I was very excited. When he had finished undressing me completely, he reminded me that we had agreed that he would be head of household and that I would submit to him. We're Christians and believe this is biblical. he said that he wanted to establish our roles from the very beginning and let me know what would happen if I didn't obey or submit to him. To my surprise and shock, he pulled me over his lap and proceeded to spank me. At first I argued and told him to stop, but he reminded me that I was not in charge. He said that he wants us to start our marriage with a clean slate. I finally submitted and began to cry. Finally, the spanking was over and he gathered me into his arms and let me cry it out while assuring me of his love. I was surprised to find that I felt so loved and safe in his arms. After I was all finished crying, he undressed. Then we engaged in the activity I had been looking forward to. I wasn't happy he spanked me at the time, but afterward I realized it was for the best. We've had an amazing marriage, and I haven't gotten very many spankings in the past few years, but knowing it's an option really helps me submit And makes me feel

There's no point rushing stuff. I'm not rushing anything. I wanna be your girlfriend. I'm starting to feel like you're just using me. What? Of course not. Then why are you embarrassed of me? That's not true. I'm not hiding you from the world. I'm hiding the world from you. I didn't wanna have to do this, but it's either me or your girlfriend. Listen, you're an amazing girl. 5 foot two, Latina, hot as fuck, sweet and caring. So what's the problem? There's a lot of things to consider here. Different pros and cons. Because she cooks amazing cake. But you are already cake. She's a good girl, but you're a freaky girl. Me or her? You seriously wanna be my girlfriend? Yes. Then convince me. I can't believe I'm doing this. I'm your number one supporter. I pull up whenever you ask and never stress you out. You already said I was freaky. Just wait until I'm your girlfriend, cause then you'll get access to the locked features. Locked features such as chocolate starfish gets unlocked. For real? Uh huh. But that's just the start.

His other hand rested on my thigh, moving in warm, gentle strokes. I arched my body, inviting him to touch more of me, to explore every inch. His mouth moved lower, tracing down my stomach, making me crave more. My body trembled as he kissed every part of me. And I let out a soft moan. Oh, Owen, I gasped, barely able to catch my breath. But it seemed like Owen didn't hear me. He just continued what he was doing, driving me wild with every touch. His hands and mouth work together. And I couldn't help the wild moans that escaped me. Elon, I moaned his name again, surrendering to the overwhelming pleasure building inside me. A wicked smile played on his lips as if he knew exactly how I was feeling. My body felt like it was on fire, like fireworks exploding inside me. Relax, baby, be patient, he whispered. My eyes drifted over his broad chest, down to his toned muscular stomach. I could smell his intoxicating scent, which only made my body tremble with more excitement. But as my gaze traveled lower, I froze at the sight of his size. You are, you're huge, I stammered. My eyes wide with shock. I swallowed hard, suddenly aware of what was about to happen. Was I ready for this? Could my body even handle him? I couldn't hide my fear. The Sheer size of him looked like it could tear me apart. Sensing my fear, Alan's hand slipped behind my head. His fingers tangled in my hair. He gently tug, making me look into his eyes. It'll fit. He rested his voice thick with desire. His eyes locked onto mine and he leaned in gently biting my shoulder. Then he kissed me passionately. Wild pleasure search through me from my spine to every.

Oh my god, sis, you're supposed to be outside walking the dog like mom told you to stop eavesdropping. I'm outside. That's how loud you two are. I can literally hear macaroni and cheese sounds from here. Oopsies, you Ava. How could you do that in my bed too? Are you serious? That was my boyfriend of three years. You took him and did that? Listen, Haley, we all know I'm the attractive sister. We're not gonna sit here and act like you're boyfriend wasn't checking me out the entire time y'all were together. Don't worry, I'll give him back. Just wanted him to be pleased for once since he complained about how terrible you are at this. Haha. What the fuck do you mean give him back? He already cheated on me. Honestly, Haley, if I were you, I would take him back because we both know you can't get any better than him. Haha. Why are you so mean to me? What did I deserve this? Don't take it personally, Haley. Your boyfriend, Evan, just wanted to try some of this peach. I hate you, Ava. You have been the worst sister ever. I never want to see you again. You do this and I don't know how you'll accomplish that considering we live in the same home. I asked my favorite astrology app, astrologist for advice on my sister and she's a Gemini and Gemini can be childish. People don't take anything seriously. So she'll have to learn a lesson the hard way. bring your butt down for family dinner and stop being so dramatic. Mom, why would I come for family dinner? Ava literally stole my boyfriend, then brought him over tonight for dinner as her date. First off, it's her boyfriend, not yours. Evan has already voiced that he's done with you cause your sister is better, so you will respect their boundaries. And 2, get your down here. No, you, mom, I'm not coming downstairs. I'm not coming out of my room ever. I'm so done. I'm coming up there right now and getting you downstairs. And you will not say a word bad to your sister or even look at her boyfriend. Mom, I'm literally so upset right now and you don't even care. Won't, won't get your butt downstairs and congratulate your sister on her new boyfriend. Mom, why? You take, she literally stole my boyfriend and you don't even care. It's like you don't even love me. My whole life you've put her ahead of me and everything. She always got the best clothes, the best gifts, the most love. You never gave me anything but pain that would show me love. But now he's gone forever. Now I'm stuck with a mother who hates me. Oh, hush up. Your boyfriend went to your sister, Ava. That is on him and not her. It's not Her fault. She's better in every category. Wow. Get your ass downstairs now. After I said my mom is a Capricorn and Capricorns are one of the least affectionate, which is why she is so mean to me. Sissy, we miss you at the dinner table. Please come down and shut the fuck up. Ava. Oh, Haley, what's with the hostility? I got a new boyfriend downstairs and I wanted to introduce you to. His name is Evan Ava. I swear to god, if you don't shut up, I'm blocking you. Haley, I just want you to meet him. He's the best. He's 6 foot 2, handsome, shredded, fizzy, and he's packing everything a girl can want. He even buys me whatever I want. You know what, Ava? You'll get what you deserve. Yeah, whatever that means. Hahaha. See you at the dinner table after mom breaks your door down. Hahaha. We'll see who's laughing next. Haley, how could you you.

Cause whatever genetics you have to have a snake like that. Need to continue. Fair.

Oh, you mean I was just trying to have a little fun with you, Olivia. No, Rima, I strictly told you not to try anything. We are friends and that is it. But we've been friends for eight years.

My favorite astrology app. I asked her app for advice and it said Rima is a Pisces. And Pisces can be very flirty and delusional. So I need to set clear boundaries with her. Listen here, Rima. You might see this all as one big joke, but I am so serious. I'm not playing these games with you. Next time you try something and our friendship is over. Got it? Alright, fine. I got it. Can we at least sit with each other at lunch tomorrow? School is so boring without you. Fine, whatever. Just don't try anything. Sure, bestie. Wait! Olivia, please come back. It Was a joke.

What does that have to do with you grabbing my Cha Cha? Olivia, I don't know what came over me. It's just. I saw them looking right back at me, and I just acted off an impulse. I'm so sorry. That's it, Rima, I'm so done with you. I don't know what's gotten into you recently, but I just can't keep dealing with this weird energy.

Rayma, what's wrong with you? Listen, Olivia, I'm just so sorry. I'm trying to respect the boundaries, but it's just whenever I'm around you, just lose myself. If that's the case, Rayma, I'm sorry we can't be friends anymore. I'm starting to get scared around you. I don't know what you do next. You're so unpredictable. Now, wait, Olivia, please don't leave. I promise I'll be better for you. Olivia, I love you, babe. What do you mean, you love me? Olivia, I've never told you, but I really do love you. And I wanna be with you forever. I know you're with Tom right now, but we've always had a strong Stronger connection. Stronger than any guy you've ever been with. And, Olivia, I just wanna be with you. Nobody else makes me feel as safe as you do. Grandma, I'm done talking to you. I can't do this. I don't get why you are like this. Why? You weren't like this when we were younger. You had boys until your uncle came to live with you and your family. After that, you just changed and became so flirty with me. Let's not talk about that, please. Whatever, grandma. I'm just done with our friendship. Goodbye.

Yeah. How severe? What you mean severe? Like are you just smart or do you have to wear earmuffs cause sounds are too loud for you? I have to wear earmuffs? That's pretty far on the spectrum. Can I hit the UDF is wrong with you? What's the problem with that? I wanna see what it's like to get with an autistic girl. Wait, are you afraid of other people touching you? Yes. I'm not good with human touch. Well look, I will take the earmuffs off and give you a nice big warm hug after I fill you up. Or we can put two sets of earmuffs on so I can hit it even louder from the back. What is wrong with you? Come on, you can't tell me you don't wanna have a good time. It'll be something new to get you out of your comfort zone. You'll get to lose your virginity and I'll get to live out my biggest dream of jizzing in an autistic girl. I think my moan will be too over stimulating. So I think you're gonna have to cover my ears with your hands when you getting into it. Don't worry darling, all your ticks will be under my control. You can't wear a condom. I'm allergic to latex. Good. I didn't plan on it. I wanted to jizz in her guts. Good. I have seven. Plan B is in my drawer waiting for the first time I could Get some jazz nuts. 7. Why 7? Cause I want you to jizz in me every day for the next week to see if it cures my autism. You can cure autism? I don't know. We can try, though. I bet if you can pound it hard enough, it will allow me to hear louder sounds. Huh? You heard me. How many inches you got? Nine. I thought nine was small. Who are you talking to, thinking that nine inches is small? My mommy. She told me if it's not at least 12 inches, to forget about it. Well, you can try out this 9 inch and tell me how you feel about it. Okay, you did it. You cured my autism. And nine inches is big. I don't know what my mom was talking about. Did you take your plan B? Nope.

Girls with autism are always the freakiest. You've been with other girls with autism? Yeah. They all spray really far and wear earmuffs during it. That's facts. I cannot go anywhere without my earmuffs. Wait, so you just like getting with girls with autism? Like, it's the only girls I ever get with. No other women know how to provide like a girl with autism.

Yeah. Do you go shave? Why? Maybe I like having a landing strip. Well, that's nasty. Every girl should be clean shaving. Well, back in my country, men thought having a landing strip meant you were ready to have a good time. Like, think about it. You still got hair, but it groomed, so it shows interest in having fun. That's not how that works. And you are from Louisiana. I mean, that might as well be another country, but you are still from the U S. So shave it. You wanna get in it, don't you? Yes, actually I wanna eat it all up. But I do not want my face to get pricked. What makes you think I would let you eat some of it? I am 6 foot 2 and have about nine inches. Yeah, you can have it. But I really don't want to shave it. I've worked so hard on it. I'll be giving it fades and plucking the outline hairs. How smooth is the surrounding areas? Really smooth. I get them waxed like once a month. So you promise it's not no jungle? I promise. Wait, you clean shave, right? No, I like having a forest. Well, what if I want it smooth? Well, you are gonna have to find me a barber for my Johnson. Cause there is no way I can get through all the hair I have with just a razor. Dude, that is disgusting. And I can't Have a landing strip, but you can have a full blown forest. I mean. Yeah. Well, how about this? If I shave mine, you have to shave yours. Then we can get with each other. But I like my bush. It makes me feel like a real man. Dude, shut up. You want cat or not

Whoa. I mean, to be fair though, cat is cat. You clean shaven? No. From diseases? Yeah, I've only let 11 random guys get with me since the last time I got tested. When did you get tested last? Two days ago. Well, would you at least clean it up for me if I got with you? Why would I clean it up? Other guys don't have a problem with it. So you either want it or you don't. Yes, ma'am. Now, I have availability on Tuesday of next week at either 10:00am to 11:00am or six thirty PM to seven thirty PM. The longer sessions are for more experienced workers. You have appointments for this stuff? Yes. Will you be using cash or card? Or we could even finance. How much does it cost? For 30 minutes it is $800 and an hour is $1,500. But it is more expensive earlier in the day cause I have less loads in me, whereas at the end of the day I'm stuffed like a Twinkie. You are expensive. Am I limited to one load? Nope. You can have as many as you can produce in your time frame. Awesome. Am I allowed to ask you To put on a strap and do it to me? No, I'm not into all that weird stuff. Just want Johnson really bad, though. I might as well get paid for it. That's fair. I'll give you 5 racks if you shave it for me and shower in between me and the guy before me. Say less. I'll even get a Brazilian if you throw in another rack. Yeah, go for it. My wife has been cheating on me. I just need some right now. Well, there is one rule I have. What? No emotions. Just scream my name and move on with it. Okay. So are you using cash or card? Cash. Is there any way I can get a monthly subscription? Subscription. That would be like 10 k a month. And you can get it twice a week. Deal. You are down bad.

Well, let's just say she isn't winning any mom of the year awards. But anyways. I have a 16 year old stepbrother, Eli. He is such, such cutie. We were both beaten up by our parents, so as soon as I turned 18, we gathered some money and we left. We're living in a tiny apartment now, just the two of us, vibing and surviving. Now, Eli is a funny kid. He's kind of cute. He has this mop of curly hair that looks like it's auditioning for a shampoo commercial, and he's always cracking jokes. We're super close. Like, way closer than most siblings like. And follow for part two.

So it was cleaning day and to be honest I like to clean freely in my panties and my shirt with no bra. I was washing my front room windows when I noticed my super cute neighbor across the street talking with some contractor guy outside his front door. He really is so handsome. Nice build, dark hair, tall, tan, and always had this dominant look to him. I catch myself blank, staring, daydreaming about him making me his good little slut when I hear my name being called. I immediately snapped out of it and noticed it was my fucking neighbour crossing the street heading straight to my house. He was waving, trying to get my attention with this big beautiful smile on his face. Almost like he was flattered BC he knew I was just thinking about being on my knees while he fucked my mouth and told me I was his good little slut. I immediately starting blushing and could feel myself starting to press my thighs together the closer he got to my door. He knocked and I answered the door the same way. I was in the window, panties and a shirt with no bra. My nipples were rock hard and I hadn't even noticed until I see my neighbor look right at my tits and all. I have natural perky D cup tits with these perfect nipples and he had their full attention. I didn't even Bother to cover myself up. I wanted him to see. I wanted him to think about what it would be like to suck on my nipples and hear me moan for more. This turned me on and here I was again, pressing my thighs together right in front of him with my hard nipples. He could see perfectly. I couldn't even tell you what he was telling me BC I really didn't even care. But as soon as he moves his eyes from my tits down to my thighs, I noticed he had a smirk on his face and asked if he could come in for a minute. Without hesitation I stepped back and let him in. The way he moved was so smooth and light and that's when I could smell him, his Cologne, his pheromones. I couldn't help but bite my lip and stare at him with those eyes that scream fuck me please. He must have caught on to what he was doing to me and asked if I liked his Cologne. I told him I loved it as I was heading past him to the kitchen and asked if he wanted anything to drink. As I was walking past him he put his arm out in front of me and stopped me and said that he seed me looking at him in the window and asked me what it was I thinking about. I blushed and started to fumble my words and he laughs saying he Had no idea he had that effect on me, and that he was flattered, but still wanted to know what it was I thinking about. I. Do you want me to be honest or lie to you? Of, of course, he said be honest, with his eyes lighting up in excitement. So I told him the truth. I was thinking about getting down on my knees and taking out his big thick cock to admire it a little bit before I start to lick on the head and work my way down, taking all of his cock in my mouth.

I lost a bet with my hubby. I lost a bet with my hubby where I agreed that I would have love with him anytime he wanted for a whole week. It was a wild week. It started on a Saturday morning and he took full advantage. The first time I woke up before him and was in the kitchen making us breakfast, came into the kitchen wearing just his boxers and lifted my robe and pulled my panties down, forcing me to remove them and throwing them to the side and saying that I would not need them this week. He wouldn't let me stop cooking as he banged me from behind and played with my. He ended up busting his loads in me and told me to keep the robe on for today since he liked the easier access. A few hours later, I was doing chores when he came into the room and whipped it out in front of my face. Knowing what he wanted, I started slurping him until he eventually bent me over and went to Pound Town. I never did something like this before, but it made me feel like a woman doing her feminine duties and I loved it. I loved pleasing him this way. He ended up freaking me eight times that first day. During the week he ended up freaking me in all kinds of wild places, like on a video. Call with my boss in my office, at work, in the woods, on a hike, in a park, and even on a bus. He would also use a remote control vibrator when we're in public. It ended up being really hot and helped our love life a ton. Even though the bet was over. I say yes to make love way more and always try to be ready even when I'm not in the mood, because with a few strokes in, I'm going to want it.

I was overworking one night and got off at ten PM. To relieve my stress, I paid a couple of homeless guys to use me in any way they wanted. This meant they could pound my cat, raw milk in my throat, and even face pound me. To my surprise, they did all of this. They pounded my cat, gave me a special facial, and even milked inside of cat and had my liquids and their milk combined. The luxury of this felt so good lol. So after about an hour of me being used by these homeless men, it was 12:00am. I offered them a chance to stay at my house for the night. We all slept in the bed together whilst completely unclothed. As we were trying to go to sleep, we were kissing, girking each other off, and they were even playing with my cherries. It was so fun. Around 3:00am or 4:00am I was done being used by them since I had made them milk 20 times each. I was sleeping peacefully, dreaming about the time I sucked 50 hot dogs in one night at an adult theater. That was the most I've ever did and I probably wouldn't do it again. I suddenly woke up to one of the homeless men hovering over my face with his hot dog deep in my throat. His friends were pounding my cat and using and licking My cherries. I quickly gave in because why not? It felt amazing. I would highly recommend this to anyone out there. Is this weird to admit? Let me know in the comment thread below that.

You had a huge situation of morning wood when I went to wake you up. I understand, but you can't do that. You are my stepmommy. Exactly. Stepmommy. We aren't blood. I didn't do it for you. And my mouth isn't the only place I put your 65 inch Johnson. I've needed some 65 inch Johnson in my life since your dad said we can't do it anymore. I would let you do unimaginable things to me. I mean, we really shouldn't. Shut up. I know it's your big fantasy. Your top search hub is Sophie Rain. How do you know that? We aren't going to talk about that. Oh, well, you're not wrong about it being my biggest dream. Your hard Johnson was so good. It was the right length and width. Hit every spot. So fucking good. How badly did you like it? Like it? I fucking loved it. Come upstairs. Your dad just left and brought your sisters to a movie, so no one is home. So come get deep in this kitty cat and thrust as fast as possible. It is going to sound like pudding being mixed. Make sure to stuff it very deep. Yes, ma'am. Will be our little secret. I will wake you every morning the same way as soon as your dad leaves for work. How are you so good at that? I couldn't even pull out because of How tight that grip was. You can get it anytime you want. I love that your tubes are tied, because I can fill you up every time. But the cleanup is still hard. You spill everywhere. Trust me, I know. It's leaking through my pants right now. If you're ready for round two. Can I be bottom this time? You can do anything you want, as long as I get that Johnson.

You cheating piece of shit. I wasted three years on someone like you. Well, now. Yeah, you did. We done here, then? Say goodbye, sweetie. Hey, Jack. Got something else to say. That model Y in your driveway, you bought it? Yeah. Why? Never knew you had that kind of money. Like you have any right to talk about. Never knew? We haven't seen each other in months. Can we talk like adults? Don't you miss me at all? Miss you? Are you kidding me? You make me sick. Can you just be civil for once? I can be civil with people, but with you? Nah, not happening.

Please stop. I know I messed up. Can you help me, please? Hell no. Who do you think you are? You cheat on me and expect me to help? We were together for three years. Does that mean nothing to you? You want advice? Fine. Here's a suggestion for you. Just go sleep with random guys, then tell them you're pregnant. If it doesn't work, keep trying. Maybe you'll get lucky and find the real dad. Shouldn't be hard since you spread your legs for anyone with a nice car. How is this all my fault? He manipulated me with sweet talk. I'm a victim too. I'm really struggling. Can't even afford the hospital bills. Yeah, I know you're struggling, but that's your problem. Now don't text me again. I just made a mistake. Every girl makes mistakes. Classic. Let me guess what's next? We were just friends. One thing LED to another. He said he pull out. He wore Protection. I'm on birth control. The baby's yours.

When my girlfriend left, I thought I was alone at her house. So I decided to watch some corn videos on the TV and I started rubbing my hot dog. I think it had been about fifteen minutes. I had watched a couple of videos, flicking through them trying to find the right one. I needed the perfect video because I wanted to surprise my girlfriend with my load on her panties. Then I finally found it, but before I could click on it, my girlfriend's sister charged in. She didn't knock and even say anything, just came straight in. I panicked and quickly turned off the TV, forgetting that my hot dog was hanging out full hard and close to exploding. Lucy, my girlfriend's little sister, stood there, didn't even say anything, just covered her mouth with her hand. I wanted to apologize to her, but before I could say anything, she wanted to make a deal with me. Let me rub your huge black hot dog and I won't tell anyone what has happened. My heart stopped and I didn't know what to to do, but because I took so long to reply, Lucy just came to me and started rubbing it. I started moaning while she was giggling, and after 30 seconds I milked, but not where I originally wanted to. He put her face right in the line and took my load as I Was just standing there.

Your brother is a much better man than you anyway. Yeah right. He's got like 500 girls right now. You're like the 484th girl he slept with this week. I won't believe such an obvious lie. We had a 1,000 dollar bet with him on who could sleep with the most girls in One week. He's doing very well. He even said he's aiming for 1,000. What? Yeah, kind of funny, no? I am losing so far though. I've only slept with 368 so far. That's why I've decided to go for the whole family at once from now on. Hey, girl plus sister plus mother plus grandma. 4 in 1. That way I can easily catch up. You can't be serious. I thought he was the one. Yep, yep, yep. Say hi to your mom, by the way.

You crossed the line. You're not her dad. You don't get to make those decisions. She needed to be cleaned. What should I have done? Let her freeze until you showed up? Yes. Or you should have called me. I would have handled it, not you. So you'd rather let her sit in MUD for hours just to make a point? That's insane. It's about respect and boundaries, and you completely ignored that. You crossed a major line. I was looking out for her health. Want her getting sick because of MUD? Any reasonable person would have done the same. A reasonable person would have picked up the phone and called the mom. I did what needed to be done. I wasn't gonna let her sit in dirt. You're making this a way bigger deal. Than it is. You don't get to decide what's a big deal when it comes to my kid. You should have known better. So what, next time I should just let her roll in the MUD until you decide to show up? Fine.

We're going to Dubai. Yippee! I love Dubai. When are we going? This week. That's amazing. But wait, why do we have tickets? I didn't think you need tickets for a private jet. What? We're flying business class. Business class? You can't be serious. There's no way I'd go in there. You couldn't even manage to get first class. I can take your sister with me if you have a problem. What the fuck did you say? Oh, nothing. First class was fully booked. So you could have just got a private jet. Babe, it'd be around 200 K each way for a private jet. It's not my problem. I'm your girlfriend. You have to pay for me. I think maybe I should go back to my ex. Why would I spend 400 K on a jet when a business class is just 2 K? I don't want you anymore. Are you serious? Ellie? Hello? A jet would have been a better choice, you failure. Is that your ex? Yeah. He literally bought me a Louis Vuitton. And here you are. You can't even book a first class? Is that my sister? Dubai with her is amazing. I should have chosen her from the beginning. Damn, I never know. She is so caked up like that. Okay, it's enough. Babe, can we just forget about it and get along? After you cheated on me with your ex? Business class is fine. I'm sorry, okay? Don't worry. I got you a ticket. Oh, honey, you're the best. Too late. Aren't you going to congratulate me and your sister on our marriage? We're going to live here forever with your sister. Get lost, you failure!

I'm not good with human touch. Well look, I will take the earmuffs off and give you a nice big warm hug after I fill you up. Or we can put two sets of earmuffs on so I can hit it even louder from the back. What is wrong with you? Come on, you can't tell me you don't wanna have a good time. It'll be something new to get you out your comfort zone. You'll get to lose your virginity and I'll get to live out my biggest dream of jizzing in an autistic girl.

You can't wear a condom. I'm allergic to latex. Good. I didn't plan on it. I wanted to jizz in her guts. Good. I have seven plan b's in my drawer waiting for the first time I could get some Jazz nans 7. Why 7? Cause I want you to jizz in me every day for the next week to see if it cures my autism. You can cure autism? I don't know. We can try, though. I bet if you can pound it hard enough, it will allow me to hear louder sounds. Huh? You heard me. How many inches you got? Nine. I thought nine was small. Who are you talking to, thinking that nine inches is small? My mommy. She told me if it's not at least 12 inches, to forget about it. Well, you can try out this 9 inch and tell me how you feel about it. Okay, you did it. You cured my autism. And nine inches is big. I don't know what my mom was talking about. Did you take your plan B? Nope.

Why are you saved in my phone as love of my life? Oh babe, it's me, your boyfriend. You've got a condition that makes you forget everything after a day, remember? Just check your diary. It explains everything. Oh, I see. I guess you're telling the truth. Don't worry, I'll always be here to remind you of us. I feel embarrassed to ask this, but what's your name? It's okay, babe, I get it. My name is Bartholomew. And yours is Annie. Thanks. You seem really sweet. Do you wanna grab something to eat? My tummy is hurting. Sure, babe. I'll come to you. Stay put, okay? Oh, and don't forget to take the pills. Pills for what? For your memory, silly. They keep you remembering. Alright, got it. I think I'm actually remembering something about you right now. I think you were babe. Go take them. Oh, okay. I had such a great day with you. Even though I woke up not knowing who you were. I'm starting to feel like I've known you forever. That's because we're meant to be, babe. I'll love you no matter what. Your love is the only thing I want to remember. Oh baby, that's so sweet. It's weird though. I keep getting flashes. Like little memories, but they don't make sense. Like last night I had a memory of you and you were. Babe. Don't stress about that. Just take the tablet and everything will feel normal. Again? Yeah, I guess. Okay. Good night. Who are you? Are you my boyfriends? Good morning, baby. Yes, it's me. Look in your diary. It'll remind you. All right? Yeah, yeah. But why are you with someone like me? I can't even remember who I am. Because I love you. You're everything to me. I'll take care of you forever. You're so sweet. But I had a weird dream last night. You were being so mean to me, and I was going to leave. It felt so real. That's just your mind playing tricks on you, babe. Remember to take your stuff. It'll help. I don't know. It felt more like a memory than a dream. Trust me, babe. Just take them. Why do you always tell me to take them whenever I start remembering things? Because those aren't real memories, only imagination. They will help you remember what's real. But it feels like every time I take them, I forget more. You're overthinking it, babe. They are for your own good. I. I just checked the memory pill bottle. I ripped off the label. Why the does the bottle say pills to make you forget? What? Why would you do that? What's going on? Tell me the truth. Comment part 2 to see what happens next.

Sounds like a screeching cat. What? No way you can listen to that! I have to. You don't understand. You're so annoying. Okay, today's the day. You told me you would be finished.

Let's go. Nah, I'm good. I'd rather stay here than become a human high chair for your niece again. Oh, my god. You're still upset about holding her? She's a baby. It's not a big deal. Not a big deal? I've been holding her more than her own parents. I'm practically her second mom at this point. That's because she loves you. She puts her arms out for you all the time. She loves me because they've made me her default babysitter. Let's not confuse love with forced bonding. Babe, you just need to say no. You're making this harder than it needs to be. Say no. Half the time they don't even ask. She's literally thrown at me like, here's a baby. Good luck. Okay, but you're overreacting. It's a vacation. Just relax and enjoy yourself. Relax? Let's recap. 23 hour drive with screaming baby dog poop aroma, and being sardined with a 75 lb dog and her puppies. Total spa vibes. It wasn't that bad. Oh, it gets better. The second we get here, I become the family nanny. Showers, baby, oh, baby meals, baby. Even when they're doing nothing. Guess who gets the baby? Me. You should have said something sooner. I tried, but apparently she only wants me. Convenient, right? Maybe because you're good with kids. I'm good with kids because I don't get tossed at them like a football every five minutes. Babe, you can't just stay locked in The room. Watch me. If I step out, I'll be holding the baby before I hit the hallway. It's like she has a radar for me. Come on, don't ruin the trip. Let's just go to dinner. Dinner? You mean where I'll hold the baby while her parents eat peacefully and she spills juice on me again? Pass. Babe, you're being dramatic. Dramatic? I've had enough of being an unpaid nanny. I'm one baby toss away from faking food poisoning. Don't test me. You're seriously going to waste the whole trip over this? Waste the trip? I'm already trapped in babysitter hell. This is self preservation at this point. Fine, stay here, but you're missing out. Missing out? Unless dinner involves someone else holding the baby, I'm good. Enjoy.

Not possible. Well, I will see you tomorrow at 6. You don't have to get dressed up. We are just gonna grab something to eat fast and go to the park and hang out. I'm not getting with you in a Park. I know. I just wanna show you how a women should be treated. Fine. I'm outside. Are you ready? Yeah, just give me one second. I'm feeding my dogs. Okay. I had a really great time last night. You know, you are the first guy to actually hold me after. And the only guy who ever actually listened to me and didn't judge me for the things I've done in the past. Hello? Justin, where are you? Please don't just leave me like everyone else. I really like you. Hello? This is Justin's mom. He got in a wreck on his way home last night, and he's in critical condition. The doctors don't think he's gonna make it. What? How? They said he was holding a picture of you guys from the park y'all went to a few hours before it happened. Um, can I come see him?

Don't you think you are a bit too clingy? I am? You never said that before. You are. I will text you later. Okay, but you sound very uninterested. Cause I am dating a guy now. I want to think about my future too, rather than year old promises. You are strange. You're picking some guy over me. I thought you'd take me. Mia, I'm starting fresh. No parents, no you. Just him. Soph, you were my only hope to escape this house. How could you ditch me for him? Life moves On. You'll figure it out. Or not. I don't care anymore. I trusted you.

She's probably crying her eyes out right now because her mom died. Text her sorry for trying to hit on her right now, or else we're fighting. Okay, fine. Ava, I'm sorry for texting you. Didn't I say to stop texting me? I'm telling Jamel. He told me to actually You know what? F this. Where's your mom at? Oh, wait. What's wrong with you? I'm getting Jamel to beat you up. At least I have a mom. That's above ground, not below. Womp, womp.

He held my head and moved it back and forth slowly. I felt a rush of liquid into my mouth. I stuck out my tongue to show it to him and asked, is this yours? It was as if his sanity was broken because he yanked badly on my waist and slowly entered his soldier. It was my first time and it felt like something was tearing inside me. Do you don't do it raw. Use condom. It was not okay to suddenly enter me because his cucumbers was huge. After all, just the tip that came and made me feel like I was going crazy. W e can't. I told you. Don't regret your decision. Unbeknownst to me, tears were dripping down the side of my eye. I hugged his neck to relieve the pain I was feeling, but the discomfort did not go away. I sobbed because the ache was excruciating. S s h okay. Don't worry. I won't move unless you permit me. He brushed my head down on my back to calm me down. A few minutes past and the pain I was feeling gradually disappeared. I removed the hand wrapped around his neck and looked him in the eye. I kissed him on the lips and he put his tongue inside my mouth. I could feel the heat of his breath and saliva reaching my mouth. You can Move now! I told him impatiently. He didn't speak and just laid me down on the mattress again. Ah h n G G G! I growled, as he opened my legs as if they were about to tear. He pounced me rashly, so I clung to the sheets. I lifted my body as he moved even faster. Sweat was already forming on his forehead as he closed his eyes. I looked at him with my breathless face, while there were a few tears in my eyes, but I didn't know the reason why his cucumbers had gotten more

To be fair, we met at the club that I work at, and you came in at, like, 11:30. Anyway, you saw me dancing and told me I looked really hot. So we carried on talking and you bought me a few drinks and you asked me if I wanted to come to your place after my shift. So we left together and ended up in your bedroom. And, you know, we wrestled. We wrestled. It was good. It was very good. And I wanna do it again, if you're down. Obviously. Hell, yeah, I'm down. Are you free tonight? I'll always be free for you.

Ain't no way you really want a wife. The college bop. You know how many miles she got, right? I'm actually embarrassed for you. Who's this? It's Tyler. Why are you on her phone?

We were best friends in school. Oh yeah. It's been like 20 years. Yeah. How you doing? I'm good. Remember Ivy? Yeah. Well, I married her. I thought she was the college bop. I just had to make stuff up. So you backed off? No hard feelings? How about we meet up? Where? Let's go to a bar tonight for old time's sake. I'm married. We're just gonna have a drink. Uh, okay, I guess. Where are you? I messed up, man. What happened? I blacked out and woke up with some girl. I cheated on my wife. I know. What did you do? Well, firstly, after that night you stole Ivy from me, I hatched a plan. And the plan has finally been concluded. 19 years ago, I snuck into your house and stole a rubber you used, then donated it to a pregnancy clinic where it was used. The woman who used it gave birth to a girl. I'll come back to this in a second. For the last 20 years. I've taught myself the art of mini relation. Then I ran into Ivy and caught up, then talk to her more and more. We've been having an affair for the past 10 years. That child she gave birth to 10 years ago is actually mine. What? It's not over. Ivy has been wanting to divorce you for me, but hasn't been able to. So that girl that was born 19 years ago, using your donation to the club we went to last night, where someone spiked your drink, so you blacked out. Then you went back to her dorm, where I snapped this picture. So now we have to prove Ivy needs to divorce you. And you didn't sign a prenup. So she gets 50% of everything and full custody of our child. What the fuck? I slept with my own blood. Why did you do this to me? I told you you'd see, you sick fuck! Too bad. So sad. Crime.

Guess we're both disappointed. I can't believe you. After everything, you do this to me? Oh, I'm sorry. Was I supposed to let you keep them? Reward you for being a cheater? I'm not a cheater, Jason. Emotional affair, physical affair, same thing. But, hey, maybe your work buddy can buy you new tickets. Oh, wait, he's broke, right? Stop. You're so cruel and you're so single. Cry harder. Everyone thinks you're an asshole for this. Everyone thinks you're a cheater. Guess whose opinion wins? I'll never forgive you for this. Don't need your forgiveness. Don't want it. I've got 20. Four hundreds and a clear conscience. You're pathetic. And you're ticketless. Bye, Swiftie wannabe.

Wait, what do you mean? Like they think I'm good looking? Yeah, she thinks you're hot. No way. And your friend is a woman, right? Yes. So I'm not going to get any surprises like last time when I found out hers was bigger than mine? I promise you won't get any surprises. Okay, good. What does she look like? She's really hot. Like 10 out of 10. Massive milkers and a queso type fat. She looks just like Prime 2007 Megan Fox. And she likes me? Yeah, she thinks you're hot. Rizzap told me to respond with thank you for blessing me by being such an amazing friend. Thank you for blessing me by being such an amazing friend. That's really sweet of you to say. No problem. I think you two will get along really well. Here's her number. Go set up a date. Okay. Thanks so much. What the fuck is wrong with you? You lied to me. What do you mean? I turn up to the date and this is the girl you called Prime Megan Fox? I don't see what you think I lied about. Well, she ain't Megan Fox. She's mega Fox. Maybe you meant she looks like Megan ate the fox. Well, I think you're just blind. Literally everyone says she looks like Megan Fox. Are you sure they mean Megan Fox and not megalodon Fox? Megan Fox, Mega ton Fox. Megan Fox XXL. Stop insulting my friend I don't care what you think. She's way hotter than Megan Fox. And stop with the fat jokes. She's a queen. Yeah, a Dairy Queen. How can you say she's not plumpy? This was the damn food Bill. And then she says she forgot her damn purse and couldn't pay. But I wasn't going to let her get away with it, so I did the one thing I knew she couldn't and ran out of the restaurant. You left her alone to pay that massive Bill? Yeah, I heard they forced her to wash the dishes till she paid it all off. Apparently, she started licking all the plates clean.

I finally lost my innocence. Congrats, bro. How was it? It was amazing. She rocked my world. Sounds like she was good in bed. She was crazy good. Like she was doing tricks on it, bro. At one point, she goes to the kitchen and comes back and starts stacking donuts on it. It was crazy. Was she hot? She was hot as hell. From a scale of 1 to 10, she was a 12. I'm talking mewtwo build, massive, badonkadonk fat ass, and she could ride me like a pony. She sounds hot as hell. Can I see a picture of her? We didn't actually take any picture. So did you get her Instagram or something? No, I actually forgot to ask her for it. Hmm. That's very convenient. Well, there was just a lot of passion, you know, and we forgot. Well, I just checked the security camera for our apartment. So this was the 12 out of 10 Mewtwo build girl you had over last night? Cause that don't look like a Mewtwo build to me. She built like a meatball. I have no idea who that is. That is not the girl I slept with last night. Then who was this you were in the kitchen with? Okay, fine. You caught me. She might not be a 12 out of 10 or have a Mewtwo Bill, but she's still kind of hot. Oh, you like them big big, huh? Because that ain't A 12 out of 10. Looks wise, that's a 12 out of 10 on the damn Richter scale. Like a girl that size can't be your sneaky link. She's more like your creaky link with how she got the floorboard sound. Is this why you didn't get a picture of her? Because she couldn't fit in the damn camera lens? Okay, that's enough. I know I slightly exaggerated her appearance, but she was really good to me. And it's not like you sleep with tens every night. The last girl you had over looked like a man. Who said it was a girl

I'm three hours away. That's too far. I'm selling it now. I bought that car when my dad passed away. You can't sell it. Boohoo! Man up, bet. Do you still have the yellow Ferrari? Yes. Price is $250,000. Great. Is there any damage on the vehicle? Maybe a small rip on the passenger seat. Uh, yeah. How did you know? That was my Ferrari five years ago, before I got kidnapped by the Mafia. I'm sorry to hear that. Are you here to buy it, or are you just reminiscing? The Mafia was trying to find the money I stole from them, but they couldn't. Do you want the car or not? I don't have time for stories. Okay, I'll cut to the good part. The money I stole is hidden in that Ferrari. Is the Mafia gonna find me? If you don't do exactly what I say? I will tell them you have the car. What do I need to do? Go to that underground garage and park it up. Hide the keys in the wheel well, and then run away as fast as you can. Okay, I'm going now. Please don't tell the Mafia. I won't. Okay, I did it. Good. Girl. Babe, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have tried to sell your car. Why the sudden change of heart? It had money hidden inside it. Stolen from the Mafia. This guy messaged me and told me to hide it in a garage, so I did. Now I'm just running home. I don't know what to do. Are you almost home? Yes. Thanks for keeping it safe. Stupid ass. Wait, that was you? You're so blonde. How could anyone own it before me? I bought it from the dealership. Babe, please forgive me. It was just a silly mistake. Now we're getting a divorce. And after the judge hears this, you won't get a penny from me. You'll be homeless. You for the streets anyway. No, baby, you can't make me homeless. Boo hoo. Woman up.

Yeah, babe, I enjoy my time with her. So remember when you said bad things will happen? It got stuck in my mind. Can you tell me why you said that? Oh, don't worry about that. I still hope we would be a couple without kids. But here is Lily. It's David's child. He was like a brother to me. Babe, I hope you understand. Yeah, yeah, I get it. What if Lily wants to see her dad though? Just distract her with her favorite toys. Please don't show her pictures of David. I don't think she is ready. I meant she can go to her dad after all. What are you talking about? Lily is still a child. That can make it look like an accident. I'm at work. I'll Call you later. You sound horrible right now. Bad things might happen today, babe.

My eyes widened and I didn't know what I was expecting, but just the moment the man pushed himself into me. I'm disillusioned with my first time. I thought it would be romantic and full of tenderness, but at that moment reality hit me. When the real pain struck, I screamed out loud. It felt like trying to escape hell, but he was like an immovable mountain crushing me. I scratched his shoulders, trying to ease the pain, but Alex's eyes showed impatience. Be a good girl, he ordered coldly, making my body stiffen as I trembled with fear. Couldn't he have said something gentle in that moment? But no, he commanded me as if I were his pet. I opened my mouth to curse at him, but he swiftly captured my lips as if to devour them and shut me up. I tried to push him away again. He grabbed my hands and pinned them above my head, leading me to struggle beneath him like a helpless fish. I never expected this man to be so rough in bed. His other hand wrapped around my waist, moving slowly across my body, inside and out, until I started to forget the pain. I don't know when exactly the pain faded away, but at some point I am brace him, allowing him to explore the deepest parts of me, not just my body, but my soul. As well. This man had turned me from a girl into a woman, showing me a whole new world, even a new version of myself. Alex didn't seem to realize what he had just done.

And you know, you know what's gonna happen to you when you go to prison. He saved a drowning boy and now he's being sued by the boy's parents. He could be facing over 10 years in prison. Twenty four year old Zachary Stein had just graduated from college. After struggling to find a full time job, he decided to take a temporary position as a lifeguard at a local pool. The job paid $16 an hour and his main responsibility was to ensure the safety of everyone in the pool. Last summer, about 66 kids from various camps were playing at the pool and Zachary was the only lifeguard on duty. During that time, a five year old boy nearly drowned. As soon as Zachary noticed what was happening, he jumped into the water, pulled the boy out and immediately performed CPR. The child was rushed to the hospital and made a full recovery within a day. Doctors said the incident left no lasting damage, but the boy's parents are now suing Zachary Stein, claiming it was his negligence that nearly cost their son's life. According to their lawsuit, the boy had been underwater for nearly four minutes before Zachary noticed him. However, Zachary wasn't distracted by his phone or taking a smoke break. He explained that the intense glare from the sun on the water made it almost impossible to see beneath the surface, which caused the delay. Zachary is now being charged with reckless endangerment and injury to a minor. If convicted, he could face more than 10 years behind bars. He was making $16 an hour, saved a child's life, and now he might end up in prison. Does that sound fair to you? Drop your thoughts in the comments.

So she's concerned that she's been friend zoned by you. I mean, she's got a great personality, and I would like to be friends with her. Yeah, but the. I mean, the thing is, Michael, nobody's on dating apps to be friends. Like, they're looking for dates. I guess that's true, but, like, you know, sometimes you meet someone who you. Who you click with on more of a friend level, and, you know, you. You don't necessarily wanna date them, but you wanna continue being friends. Like, I think men and women can be friends, so, you know. Well, I don't. I don't think there's any possibility of men and women ever being friends, ever. You do not believe that. The bottom line, you just feel like you guys are better off being friends, and that's it. Yeah, she's very cute, you know, she's just not quite my type, I would say. Okay, so what's your type, then? Uh, I mean, my friends always make fun of me for it, so, um, you know. Make fun of you for it? Yeah. Why? They. They make fun of your type of person you like to date.

Hi. Is this Ben? This is, who is this? Ben? What's up, dude? How are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Are you serious? I am serious. Am I on the radio right now? Maybe. I don't know. Hi, Ben. Hi. Why are you guys calling me? Good question. Well, I'm calling you because somebody emailed us to do a second date update on you. Uh, I, I don't know what a second date update is. I guess you don't. No, no. You miss it. I, you sound like you listen to the show, but you, we do that a lot. You never heard it? I'm a fan of like the prank phone calls. Those are hilarious. Okay. But I don't think I've heard of the date thing. Well, the date thing is called a second date update. So you went on a date with somebody and now you're not calling them back, basically. Oh, yeah. I think I may have heard of this before or heard one of these. Okay. Well, now you're the star of one Ben. Yay, Ben. It's your time to shine. Oh, man, I can't. Haha. So do you know who might want to get in touch with you? Um, no, I don't have any idea really. What about with a coworker of yours named Dana? Oh, man. Do you know who we're talking about? Oh, yes, I do know. Yes, I now know what you're talking about. Okay. Yeah, that was an interesting night. So wait, you knew that it was a date? Did you know it was a date? I thought that it was a really awkward time, to be honest with you. What were you thinking when you were, I mean, you got there and nobody else was showing up. It was just you and her? Yeah, I got there and no one else was there. And she said that everybody cancelled. And I could just tell the way that she said that, that not everybody cancelled and that she had just kind of lied to get me there. Oh, so you knew, you knew it was a setup by her at that moment? Yeah, I, it was kind of obvious. Like there was a table for two waiting for us. And just the way that she, I didn't think about that. Yeah. Yeah. The way that she said that the people canceled, I could tell that it wasn't real. Like not, not everybody's gonna cancel. And so I, it kind of was just painfully obvious that we were now sort of on like a first date. Yeah. But you, I mean, you would exchange numbers with this girl. You said that she was nice and that maybe kind of attractive. The thing is, if she would have just text me and asked me out, I would have gone out. But I felt so weird that I was tricked. And then all I'm thinking about is Like she lied to get me here. What else is she capable of? It's kind of crazy, you know, I just felt it just totally threw me off. I mean, at one moment she said that she thought you ditched her at the restaurant because you left like you got up to go to the bathroom and then you went outside. Yeah, one point it was really awkward so I didn't know what to say and I was kind of angry that I got duped. So I ate my sushi just really fast cause we weren't talking and she still had a whole plate of it. And I so I said, hold on, I'm just gonna go to the bathroom and just excuse myself and then went in the bathroom and like put cold water on my face and thought about like what is going on? And then I kind of walked out of the restaurant and I didn't even say goodbye to her. I just was like I said I was a little mad and I got outside, I was gonna take a cab home and I realized I forgot my wallet and I was like, oh my gosh. And I don't know what else to do. I didn't want to walk home. So I just walked back into the restaurant and I told her that I had had an emergency and I had to take a call and it it was fine and but now I'm back but I forgot my wallet. I don't know. It was just, I was trying to put the whole thing out of its misery. It just felt so awkward. And I thought that she would want that, too. But. So you came back to the restaurant just because you needed a ride home. You didn't have a change of heart? Really? Kind of embarrassingly, yes. That's the only. Oh, my God. So the emergency phone call and all of that was a lie. You just couldn't escape like you wanted to. Your escape route was ruined. It was excruciating. I had to escape, but. Right. And then I failed at escaping and had to call back. Pathetically, man, that's a lot of lies built into this one outing for you. Since we're getting all of our lies out in the open, I have to let you know that I lied. And she's actually on the other line listening and wants to talk to you. Are you serious? Yes, I am. Hi, Ben. Oh, my gosh. Um.

So our family turned savage. Uncle Theo was the black sheep who made billions in tech while the rest of us struggled with middle class lives. When he died at 47, childless and bitter, we expected nothing. He cut us off years ago after dad tried borrowing money for his failed restaurant. A lawyer gathered us in Uncle Theo's mansion, a cold glass Monument to his success. Mom clutched her purse like a shield. My cousin Brett smirked, already calculating his share. Aunt Carol brought a notebook ready to document everything. The will was simple. One riddle winner takes everything, $847 million, the mansion, the tech company shares. The rest of us get nothing. The riddle read, I built my fortune on what others discarded. Look where the forgotten gather and you'll find what matters most. The answer sleeps where I first Learned that broken things can be fixed. Brett laughed. That's it, some cryptic garbage about broken things. The lawyer announced we had 30 days. The drive home was tense. When we got home, my parents immediately started arguing about strategy. Dad punched the kitchen wall, leaving a hole that seemed to symbolize everything breaking apart. That's when I realised how desperate we really were. Dad's business was failing. Mom's medical bills had drained their savings. This inheritance wasn't just money. It was survival. Within 48 hours, everything changed. Brett hired puzzle experts and rented a hotel room. Near the mansion, Aunt Carol started stalking Uncle Theo's old friends, demanding details about his childhood. My cousins began competing instead of collaborating, hoarding clues like jealous dragons. The worst was watching my parents transform. Dad became obsessed, spending 18 hour days researching Uncle Theo's past. Mom started following other family members, convinced they were hiding information. Then things got ugly. Someone broke into Uncle Theo's old apartment. Two days later, Aunt Carol's car was vandalized, every window smashed, the word cheater spray painted across the hood. The family group chat became a battlefield. Brett claimed someone had stolen documents from his hotel room. Cousin Riley insisted her research files had been hacked. During a family meeting, I suggested we work together. The room erupted. Uncle Marcus accused dad of hiding clues. Aunt Carol screamed that we were all backstabbing parasites. Brett threatened to hire security. That night, I found mom crying in the kitchen, clutching Uncle Theo's photo from when they were kids. He was my little brother, she whispered. We used to fix broken toys together in Grandmother's garage. Now look what his money is doing to us. I realised we weren't just solving a riddle anymore. We were destroying each other for a fortune that might not even exist. The next morning, I discovered something that changed everything. Hidden in Uncle Theo's childhood bedroom behind a loose floorboard was I couldn't fit. What happens next in this short video. Watch the rest down below.

Lena was used to being alone. On weekends. Her parents traveled often. She had the house to herself, with only her dog, Max, for company. The house was still that night, only the faint creek of old wood in the walls. She checked the locks, slid the chain, and went upstairs. Max followed her, but stopped at the bedroom door. He lay on the rug, eyes fixed on her. In bed, she let her hand fall over the side. Whenever she was nervous, Max would lick her fingers. It had made her feel safe ever since she was a child. Outside, rain hammered the windows and lightning flashed inside. Sometime after midnight, she woke to a faint rustle in the room, the kind of sound you hear when you're not alone. Her chest tightened and her pulse began to race. A cold shiver crawled up her spine. Then a warm tongue brushed her fingers. Her breathing slowed. She felt safe again. She closed her eyes and drifted back to sleep. Sunlight woke her. She called for Max. Downstairs. The back door was wide open. Max was outside, locked in his kennel, staring at her. A small note was taped to the kennel door. It read in neat handwriting, humans can lick, too.

Where did you hear that date? It was in the note with Dad's watch. The watch you said was destroyed. Emma, where are you right now? Still at Jessica's. Her mom's about to drive me home. Number? Go to Aunt Claire's instead. Don't come home. You're scaring me. What's going on with these texts from Dad's number? Someone is trying to manipulate you. Your father died in that accident last month. Then why is his watch here? Why does someone know about July 15th? Your father's former partner must have gotten access to his personal effects. What partner? You said dad worked alone. I needed to protect you from certain aspects of his work. There's another text. Ask about the offshore account in the Caymans. Don't respond to any more messages. They're trying to get information. Information about what? What was dad involved in? Your father was an accountant for some powerful people. He found discrepancies. Criminal discrepancies. Was dad in danger? We're in the car now. Jessica's mom is acting strange. She keeps checking her mirrors. Is she taking you to our house or to Claire's? Neither. We're heading toward the lakehouse where the text said to go. Emma, that's not Jessica's mother. The real Carol has a scar on her wrist. She's wearing long sleeves. I can't tell. Ask to use her phone. Say yours is dying. She refused. Said her battery is low, too. Try to get a look at her wrist. Find An excuse. I asked her to check the time. No scar. Mom, who is this woman? Listen carefully. When she slows down at the next intersection, unlock your door and run. She just locked all the doors from her control panel. Is there anything in the car you can use as a weapon? Jessica's field hockey stick is in the backseat. I'm 10 minutes from the lakehouse. Is she still heading there? Yes. She just got a call. She's speaking another language. Sounds Eastern European. Your father's files exposed an international money laundering operation. Dad was just an accountant. How did he get involved in this? He was recruited specifically because of his skills. He didn't know what they were hiding. She's pulling over at the convenience store. Says she needs cigarettes. This is your chance. Get out while she's inside. I can't. She took the keys and told me she'll be watching through the window. Check the glove compartment. Is there anything useful? There's a gun, mom. A real gun. Don't touch it. It could be a setup. She's coming back. She's talking to someone outside the car. Take a photo of them. Discreetly, if you can. Done. Sending it now. That's Andre Kozlov. He worked with your father's firm. We're driving again. They're taking me to the lakehouse. The watch, Emma, is there anything unusual about it? The back has a small SD card taped to it. I never noticed before. That's what they want. Your father must Have copied the evidence. Should I destroy it? No. It's the only leverage we have. It's evidence of their entire operation. We're at the lakehouse. There's a black SUV waiting. I'm two minutes away. Can you see who's in the SUV? It's Mister Peterson from Dad's office. The one who spoke at his funeral. He's the one who recruited your father. He's been leading this whole operation. She's making me get out of the car, stall, ask questions, keep them talking until I get there. Peterson says he just wants the watch and we'll be safe. He's lying. They can't leave witnesses. He's showing me a badge. FBI. Is that possible? Huh? Boost for part three.

In my fiance's family, every first born son for seven generations was required to be named Peter. The same name as my uncle who died in prison after what he did to those children. When I first met Jake's parents, they seemed like normal people. They lived in a split level house with wood paneling and pictures of all the Peters covering every wall. Seven generations of Peters staring down at me during Sunday dinners. I'd mention my uncle once, early on, testing the waters. Jake, mom just waved her hand like she was swatting a fly. That has nothing to do with our Peters, she said, passing me more mashed potatoes. You can't let one bad apple spoil the whole bunch. The pregnancy test showed two lines on a Tuesday morning. Jake was thrilled, spinning me around the kitchen until I felt dizzy. His parents found out that weekend, and from that moment on, every conversation circled back to when little Peter arrives. Mom bought onesies with Peter the eighth embroidered on them. His dad started refinishing an old crib, humming while he worked. I tried bringing up names with Jake, showing him lists I'd made. He'd kiss my forehead and say, we'll figure it out. But I could see the weight of seven generations pressing down on his shoulders. At seven months pregnant, the baby shower felt like an ambush. Jake's mom had decorated Everything in blue, with Welcome Baby Peter banners stretched across the living room. The cake had eight candles on it. When she gave her speech, she talked about legacy and tradition, about how proud Jake's great, great, great grandfather would be. I sat there with my hands on my belly, feeling my son kick against my ribs. That night, I finally broke. We're not naming him Peter, I told Jake. His parents heard me from the kitchen. Silence felt like a held breath before his mom started crying and his dad slammed his fist on the table. You're destroying seven generations of tradition, his mom wailed. You think you're too good for our family? I imagined my mother writing Peter on every birthday card, her hand hesitating before each letter. Christmas mornings, where she'd avoid saying his name altogether, just calling him sweetheart or the baby. I imagined him at 8 years old, working on a family tree project for school, asking why he was named after great Uncle Peter. What would I say? I imagined my dad leaving the room whenever someone said the name too many times, the way he still did when anyone mentioned his brother. I imagined my son finding old family photos someday, pointing at the man who shared his name, asking innocent questions I'd have to answer. The weight of it pressed against my chest until I couldn't breathe. Jake and I had decided on Oliver months before he was born. We'd written it In my pregnancy journal. Whispered it to my belly at night. It was a good name. A fresh start. We told ourselves his parents would understand once they met him. They'd hold him and smell that new baby. Smell and forget all about Peters. Love would win. It had to. When the nurse brought the birth certificate, we didn't hesitate. Oliver James. Done. Jake's parents visited that afternoon. They read the card once, then again, like maybe they'd misread it. They held Oliver like he might break. 20 minutes later, they left. But they came back. For three weeks, this uneasy quiet settled over everything. They brought casseroles, did laundry, held Oliver a little longer each visit. Jake started saying things like, they just need time. I started to believe him. We've been stupid. Three weeks of silence was a warning, not acceptance. The knock came Tuesday morning. C P S. Someone reported we were neglecting our baby, that he was malnourished and living in squalor. The social worker walked through our spotless house, checked Oliver's weight charts, examined his nursery. Found nothing. Two weeks later, another visit. Drug use allegations. We took tests. We past. The third visit came with police. Anonymous tip about screaming. Possible abuse. Neighbors started staring. Four visits in six weeks, each report more desperate. The social worker looked exhausted. These calls are from the same number. She finally said, your son is clearly thriving, but I must investigate every report. Jake knew we both Knew his parents were building a case. That we were unfit, that Oliver belonged with them. The fifth report claimed we were cult members planning to sacrifice our baby. That's when the social worker intervened. This is harassment. File a police report. Document everything the detective pulled. Phone records, dozens of calls from Jake's parents. False reports everywhere. The sixth time, C P

First off, stop saying my husband. He is your dad. Second off, stop lying. Mom, this weirdo is not my dad. He is your boyfriend. My dad is gone. And second, you always ignore it when I tell you what he does. Because you're lying, Helen. So you're just gonna act like you didn't see him sniff the chair? The perfume you were wearing smelled amazing, so I don't blame him. Or when he wouldn't stop complimenting me when I was wearing my new dress. He was just admiring your beauty, that's all. Mom, you can't be serious. I literally have a bruise on my arm. Here you go making up lies again, you. I slipped down the stairs. Helen, you're only doing this because you're mad I divorced your dad. So now you're trying to make my new husband look like a villain? Stop lying! I asked my favourite astrology app, Astra app, for advice, and it said my mom is a Gemini, and Geminis don't take serious. So I should show her proof so it's in her face. Mom, you know what? Since you think I'm such a liar, how about you come home so I can show you proof? You know what? Yeah. As soon as I come home, I'm telling Derek to come to the dinner table so we can talk about this. I'll be waiting. Well, after talking with you two, I do believe Derek did it. But It seems like you deserved it. Deserved it? Mom, are you crazy? This man is not my father, so he has no right to do anything to me. You were talking out of line. So you were disciplined? I told you to respect your elders. Mom, I am a whole 18 years old. This man has no right over me whatsoever. I can't believe you defend this. Are you that delulu? Watch your mouth when speaking to the woman who carried you for nine months. I had a long day at work, so I will be sleeping now. Goodbye. Mom, you can't be serious. Mom, mom, you'd never believe this. What? You're getting ready to lie on my husband again? Mom, I found a camp in my bathroom. Wait, what? How did you even find that? I unscrewed the head of the shower and I seen it looking right back at me. Your husband has been watching? Helen, I'm tired of you always putting the blame on him. He didn't do that, mom. What? This is literally his house we just moved into. Who else could have put it there? I don't know, but it wasn't him. So shut up and stop trying to separate me from my man! Mom, you can't be serious. Shut up, mom! Ever since you found this man, it's like you've completely changed as a person. You don't care about me at all or what's happening. You treat his kids way better than you treat Me? They get all the love and attention, and I get nothing but being told to sit in my room alone. You're letting this man tear us apart. He's clearly a weirdo. Helen, that's enough out of you. If you keep lying, you will be grounded for a year. I can't believe you. Mom! Mom, he's giving me that creepy look again. I'm so scared. It's just us right now. Helen, I don't have time for you right now. I am at work. Please stop overreacting. Mom, no, I'm so serious. He's being extremely weird right now. I don't care. Here. Mom, he just tried me, so I ran into my room and locked the door. Mom, please come home. I need you to come see the type of man you marry. Helen. What? What? Maybe if you stopped being so difficult, there wouldn't be a problem. Difficult? Mom, you can't be serious. Mom, he's about to break this door open! Honestly, Helen, I don't care. This is your fault for being such a headache. Maybe if you acted better, things like this wouldn't happen. Who do you think you are? Not responding to your mom, huh? Helen? Helen! Just got home. Where did you and my husband run off to? The door is broken and your room is a mess. What did you do to him, you little rascal? You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

So who am I speaking to then? You don't know me. Let's just keep it that way. Oh, come on. That's no fun. What's your name? Lily. Lily Smith. Yeah, you know me? Well, you know, heard of you. At least. Ah, you got me there. Yeah. Ha ha. So are we really doing this? Three days with each other's phones? There's no other choice. Unless you wanna drive six hours to meet us at our first stop, be my guest. Yeah, I don't know about all that. Anyways, let's make this interesting. How about we both can choose one app that's off limits? Alright, what app are you gonna choose? I choose notes. Notes? What the hell you got going on in there? Nothing. I chose it so now you can't see it. Okay then I'm going to do Snapchat. I wonder why. Oh stop it. Are you trying to call me a fuck boy? Ha ha. Maybe. At least get to know me. Just because I play football does not mean I'm one of them. I guess we will have to wait and see. Oh shoot, my dad just told me cell service is about to go out. We are in the middle of nowhere. I'll text you in a bit. Alright, see you soon Lily. Gosh, that was long. Thankfully you had games on your phone. Oh yeah, glad I could help. Haha, those come in handy sometimes. Hey, I have a question. Are you still dating Emma? Emma? How do you know about her? Everyone was talking about you guys and how great of a couple you were. Oh, well thankfully that's no longer. Thankfully? Yeah, she cheated on me. Oh my god, I'm so Sorry. No, no, don't be. I'm glad it happened. Why? Rizz app. What should I say? Because now I got my eyes on finding someone better. Because now I got my eyes on finding someone better. Oh. Anyone in mind? Uh, I don't know. I guess you could say I have a little crush. Really? Who? Ha, ha. You aren't gonna find out that easy. Oh, my god, you are really going to make me wait. Well, you are making me wait 3 days for my phone, so I think you can wait as well. Okay, maybe you're right. Ha, ha. It's getting kind of late. I think I'm gonna head to bed. Okay. Good night, Adam. Good night, Lily. Good morning, Lily. I hope you slept well. If you count sleeping in the back of a van sleeping well, then I guess you could say I did. Oh, yeah. Ha, ha. I forgot about that. Hey, I have a question. Go for it. What's in your notes that is so important? Oh, my god, stop. You can't look. I won't, but I'm curious now. Ha ha. Well, how about this? At the end of the trip, you can open my notes app on one condition. Which is? You tell me who your crush is. Oh, I think I could work with that. Yay! So where did you guys road trip to? We just got to Baltimore. No way. I have family there. Could they meet you and get my Phone. Oh, I mean, we are just about to leave now. I don't think we can. Haha, I'm just messing with you. I don't have family there. Oh my god, you scared me for a second. I'm guessing you're not actually leaving. Just wanted to keep talking. Well, I guess you could say you were right. Haha, I knew it. I'm actually sort of glad this all happened. Me too. You're really fun to talk to. Oh, thanks. I think I'm gonna go play some basketball. Okay. Have fun. Who said I was going? How are you gonna play while texting me? That's why Facetime was invented. Facetime? Uh, I don't know about that. Why not? I don't look good right now. Oh stop it. I see you every day and you look amazing all the time. Now is no different. Do you really think that? Of course. OMG, you're so sweet. Ha ha. I tried. Now pick up. Alright. Well that was fun, wasn't it? Yeah, you could say that. I didn't know you were that good at basketball. You play football? Ha ha. Well, what can I say? An athlete is an athlete. I'm gonna shower and get ready for bed now, Adam. Okay. I'll have you know though, tomorrow is the big day. Yeah. Ha ha. See you then. Good morning, Adam. Wakey Wakey, I'm awake. Your message notification can wake up my whole house, let alone just me. Haha yeah, it is a pretty loud one. So can I go on the notes app yet? Not just yet. Have some patience. You can do it when I'm an hour away from home. And how long is that gonna be? Well, for starters, I'm 6 hours out. Oh my god. So long. For what? This better be good. Hopefully you like it. Me? Why would I like it? Oh, I don't know. I mean, just like after the wait. I hope you like it. I see. Well, I never thought I would be texting myself, but I will say this has been pretty fun. Same to you, Adam. Yeah, I was going to complain to the school about getting our phones mixed up, but I guess I'll cut them a break this time. Haha. This time. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. If it's with you, I wouldn't mind. Oh, okay, Adam, we are going back to a no service area. I'll text you when I'm close. Okay, you can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

Okay, is this, like, he has a pretty crazy search history that includes a kinky fetish type thing, or is it worse? No, it's worse. Um, so I was looking at his iPad because it's connected to his phone, and I had to reset our home, like, security system, and he keeps the code on there in his note section. So I was getting the code, and I noticed one of the sections in his note that was called Gift Ideas. So I was like, hmm, maybe I'll take a quick peek, see if he picked up on the many hints that I've been leaving. Um, so wait. So, wait, so you snoop? So you're a Christmas gift snooper, then? For shame. Yeah, I know. I'm a bad person, but, uh, anyway, I was looking, and I see some. Some of the stuff he was thinking about getting the family and friends, and then I see a name, staff. And I'm like, hmm, I don't know a staff. Um, and I see he was planning on getting her, um, diamond stud earrings. So who. Who the heck is this staff person? So, to your knowledge, he doesn't have, like, a cousin staff or a sibling? It's not his mom's name or his grandma? No. No staff that I can think of at all. And I'm like, well, maybe this is just a coworker. Or a good friend. But still, like, is it even okay for a married man to buy. Be buying diamond earrings for a friend or a coworker? I mean. I mean, it kind of depends, so. Right. I mean, if it's somebody, maybe they're retiring after many years of working with him. Or are the diamonds, like, teeny, tiny cheapos? Listen, but even if they are, I don't know if a married man has any business buying diamond earrings for another woman for any reason. Has he ever bought you diamond earrings? Yeah, but many, many years ago. Okay, but see, he took care of his wife first. Then I don't know. I don't think there's any reason why a married man should be buying diamond earrings for another woman. See, that's exactly how I feel as well. So. Okay, what do you want us to do then, Casey? I like to know who this staff person is and why he's buying her diamond earring. Okay, well, I'm not sure if we can answer the second question, but we can definitely find out the more important one, which. Who is this staff person? And. And I'm assuming we can call your husband? Yes, absolutely. Okay. And what is his name? I don't think you ever told us. It's John. John. Okay, so hang on a sec, and then we'll get John's number from you, and then we will call him when we come back next. Hello? Hi, can I speak To John, please. Can I ask who's calling? Sure. This is the Z Morning Zoo radio show on Z1O4. Nick, Natalie and Shaggy. Is this John? It sure is. What's up, everybody? Not much. How are you this morning? I'm doing well. I'm doing real well, actually. I feel a lot better if you're about to tell me I won something, though. Oh, yeah? Well, I wish that was why you were calling. Actually, we've been doing something really special on our show this week called Sexy Secret Santa, and that's why we called you. Okay, so the way it works is if somebody's got, like, a special person in their lives and they're kind of, like, a secret, they call us and tell us to wish them a very sexy Christmas. Kind of lame, you know? I know. But listen, we got a call from Steph about you. I guess she said you were a very special person to her, so. Who is Steph

Yeah, like I said, you guys do look similar. But you said you think she's ugly, and supposedly you think I'm hot.

Yesterday, my phone rang at 2:00am. It was the police. Ma'am, we have your six year old son, Tommy at the station. He walked here by himself, saying his mommy heard his baby sister. I shot out of bed. What? Tommy's in his room sleeping. And I don't have a baby sister. Ma'am, please come down to the station immediately. I ran to Tommy's room. Empty bed, front door wide open. At the police station, Tommy was wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The moment he saw me, he screamed, don't let her take me! She killed my sister. My heart stopped. The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room, while Tommy saw bobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. I spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. His little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. The psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy's story never changed. Hours passed. The detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Ex explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She showed me the room. She Made all pink and pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us? But before I could answer,

Someone from your dreams. That's cute. So who am I actually talking to? I feel like if I told you, it wouldn't be as fun. Plus, I will get rejected. So what now? I want to play a game with you. A game? I'm down. We keep talking until July. If you know who I am, you decide if we go on a date or not. And if I don't know who you are? Then I will not reveal myself. Sure, why not? Just so you know, my eyes are on another girl. She's my crush since first grade. Oh, okay. Hiya. I saw you on the bus today. Oh yeah? You gave that old lady your seat. Wait, you saw that? Who are you exactly? Someone who sees more than you think. Kinda creepy, but go on. Not creepy, just observant. Alright, if we're playing this game, describe yourself physically. Hmm. Should I make it easy for you? Just a little hint. Something I'd recognize. You know, that's fair. Well, I'm very small. I'm Blonde. And I always wear a pair of red sneakers. I've worn them every day since the start of the semester. Half the school wears red sneakers. Maybe I'll need more than that to be sure. Fair enough. Tell me about the girl you have a crush on. Why do you wanna know? No reason. I'm just curious. I feel like you don't like her already. You will probably do something to her, I promise you. I'm just curious about it. I probably don't know her.

Anyways, I'm going with my mom. Talk to you later. Talk soon. Unknown. Ha ha. Hey. Yeah? Have you spotted any interesting shoes lately? Not yet. I've been distracted. Elodie was at the same party as me last night. Oh? And how did it go? It was alright. She didn't notice me much. She was with her friend all the time. Maybe it's for the best. It'll give you more time to focus on other mysteries. Me, for example. Haha, you're right. I don't even know Ellie. Shame. Is that how you feel too? We have never met before, yet you still like me? Why are you even trying? That's exactly how I feel. I like you because you're elegant, you smell nice and you're Very kind. But there is something else. Oh, yeah? What is it? It's something in your eyes. I can't explain what it is, but it's very unique. It makes me wanna be with you. Oh. Thanks. Anyways, tomorrow I have a game. I need to catch some sleep. Good night, unknown. Good night. Hey. No messages today. How are you? Been thinking about me? Not at all. Really? Well, maybe a little bit. I wanna know who you are. That's for you to figure out, I guess. But I met Ellie today. Oh, nice. How did it go? It was great. But that doesn't matter because she was wearing a cute dress. Ellie is petite and blonde. And most importantly, Ellie was wearing red sneakers. Don't you think that's a crazy coincidence? You and my kindergarten crush have the same traits. What a crazy coincidence. I guess. Answer me. I wanna know who you are. You have one guess in this game. Is this your last answer? Yes. Is it you, Ellie? That would have been beautiful. But no, I'm not Elodie. My name is Gilbert. I'm actually a guy. I was scared to specify earlier. I thought you wouldn't want to keep talking to me. Sorry about that. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

Don't be so harsh. It's her first shh day. Maybe she's just trying to figure things out. Yeah, I guess. But why would I bother talking to anyone else when I have you? Ah, you're too sweet. Don't worry. She'll know soon enough that you're all schmine. Good. I'd never leave you anyway. Wanna grab dinner tonight? We can stop by your favorite burger place. Oh, my god, yes. You don't need to tell me twice. See you at 7. OMG, Daniel, that was such a fun night. Of course, babe. Anything for you. Oh, by the way, did you check the work group chat? Nope. What's up? I have to train the new girl tomorrow. What are the chances they put me on that? No way. Just be nice to her. Maybe you can be her friend. I don't need new friends when I have you. You're too sweet. Just don't be mean. That's all I'm saying. I'll try my best, but if she keeps asking dumb stuff, we might have a problem. Ha, ha. Don't stress too much. Just try to have fun. I'm heading to bed. See you tomorrow. Hey. We didn't talk much today. How was training with Sophia? Honestly, better than I expected. She chilled out with the Dumb questions. And she's actually pretty funny. Guess what her favorite movie is. What? The incredible. What are the odds? No way! That's my favorite movie. What a crazy coincidence. She must be cool then. I know, right? Yeah. I think you'd actually get along with her. You should talk to her. Tomorrow. Maybe. Anyway, I gotta study for a test. I'll see you tomorrow? Of course. Good luck on your test. Daniel, you barely even looked at me at work today. You were with Sophia the whole time. Babe, come on. Don't be like that. Training takes more than a day. Once it's over, you know, I'll make it up to you. I guess. Learn anything else about her? Yeah, actually. She loves sushi and she's really into working out. Cantina app. I need roast bot. My boyfriend doesn't give me attention because of a new girl. What should I do now? Just say she lifts weights, you lift excuses. She lifts weights, you lift excuses. Oof! That one hit. Use Cantina app to improve your roasting skills. Do you wanna hang out tonight? I don't think I can, babe. I was gonna hit the gym, but tomorrow for sure. Okay. I'll just stay in and watch movies then. Have fun. Talk to you later. Of course, babe. Babe, why weren't you at work today? I don't know. Just wasn't feeling great, I guess. I hope you feel better soon. Can you come over? I don't think I can. Babe, why not? You always bring me food and medicine when I'm sick. you know how some theaters bring back old movies for a limited time? Yeah. What does that have to do with anything? I can't go anywhere. I'm sick. They're playing the Incredibles. I thought I'd take Sophia to see it since she was looking for something fun to do. You're taking Sophia to see my favorite movie? Mia, don't be selfish. It's also her favorite movie. And you're sick. As you said yourself. You can't go anywhere. Wow. What's up with this girl? Why is she all you talk about now? Are you seriously trying to start an argument right now? I'm just asking. We're dating, and yet you keep talking about her. And now you're taking her to do something I've always wanted to do with you. I don't know. Maybe because she actually makes me happy and doesn't just sit around and scroll on TikTok all day. Instead, she actually does things to improve her. So. Wow. So that's how it is, right? I mean, yeah, she cares about me. I have to beg you to care about me. Okay, well, I guess we're done, then. Have fun at the movies. I will. Thanks. Mia. I just wanted to say I'm sorry for how I acted yesterday. Hey, that wasn't me. Why weren't you at work today? Still sick? I quit. What? Why? You love that job. Sometimes the things you love don't always Love you back.

Definitely having my underwear go missing every few days. I always thought my brothers were just gross and didn't know how to do laundry properly. So for years I'd find my bras hanging from the ceiling fan or my favourite panties stuffed behind the couch cushions. I just figured they were being immature jerks who thought it was hilarious to mess with their little sister's stuff. But last month I was home from college doing laundry in the basement when I heard footsteps upstairs. Everyone was supposed to be out. Mom was at her book club, dad was working late, and all my brothers had football practice until six. I crept upstairs and saw movement in my room through the cracked door. I grabbed a baseball bat from Jake's room and slowly pushed my door open. There was Dylan, my 19 year old brother, going through my dresser drawer. But he wasn't stealing anything. He was putting clothes back. Clean, folded clothes that I've been looking for everywhere. I watched him carefully place my favourite pink sports bra in the exact right spot and smooth out a pair of leggings before closing the drawer quietly. I was so confused that I just stood there watching. Then he went to my closet and pulled out this huge garbage bag from behind my winter coats. Inside were probably 30 pieces of my missing clothes, all perfectly clean. And folded. He started hanging up shirts and putting socks back in their proper places, like he'd done this a thousand times before. That's when I noticed his hands were shaking. Kept stopping to take deep breaths. And at one point he just sat on my bed holding one of my hoodies against his chest. I realised he was crying. My tough older brother, who played varsity football and never showed emotion about anything, was sitting in my room sobbing into my clothes. I accidentally kicked the door and it creaked. He's

Every Sunday for 15 years, my grandmother made the same announcement at family dinner. When I pass away, everything goes to whoever visits me most. She tap her cane on the floor and smile like she just revealed state secrets. This turned my entire extended family into vultures. My Aunt Rachel drove three hours every Tuesday just to vacuum Grandma's living room. Uncle Steve called twice daily asking about her arthritis. My cousin Jennifer moved back from California and started doing Grandma's grocery shopping. They all hated each other, but pretended to be saints around her. Meanwhile, I. I was banned from inheritance discussions. I liked guys and chicken nuggets, grandma made it crystal clear that sinners don't deserve family money. She'd change the subject whenever I entered rooms. My cousins would smirk and whisper about how I'd be working at McDonald's while they lived in luxury. But here's what none of them knew. I actually loved spending time with grandma. Not for money. She'd already told me I wasn't getting any, but because she was genuinely funny. When she wasn't performing for the Inheritance Hunters while they argued over who deserved what, I'd sneak over on Wednesday nights to watch old movies and eat ice cream. Grandma would relax completely when it was just us. She'd tell dinosaurs jokes from the 2000 BC and complain about how fake everyone was being. She even started Asking about my boyfriend, and seemed genuinely interested in our relationship. Never mentioned these visits to anyone because I knew they'd think I was scheming. After she passed last year, the whole family gathered for the will reading. Rachel brought A calculator. Steve wore his funeral suit from 1995. Jennifer had already started planning her European vacation. They were practically drooling as the lawyer opened the envelope.

Ashley's mom helped us get this place and co signed the lease, so she has spare keys for emergencies only. Ashley's always been babied and never really lived independently. Her mom still does her laundry, brings groceries, and calls every night to check in. Last Friday I went out with work friends for happy hour after a brutal week. Got home around eleven PM. Totally normal for Friday night. I'm quietly unlocking our door when suddenly it swings open before I can turn the key. Ashley's mom is standing there in fuzzy pink pajamas. With this stern look. She goes, where have you been, young lady? It's a school night. I'm confused as hell. Like what? I work full time in marketing, it's Friday night, and I'm 23 years old. I politely explain I was out with co workers getting drinks. She starts lecturing about responsibility and how girls my age shouldn't be out drinking on weeknights. First of all, it's Friday. I'm trying to get past her when she blocks me and holds out her hand like a crossing guard. Give me your car keys. You're grounded for the weekend. I actually burst out laughing because I thought she was joking, but she's dead serious and repeats it. I need to hand over my keys because I was completely irresponsible and Ashley told her how worried she was. I look around for Ashley and she's literally hiding behind the kitchen island, avoiding eye contact. This girl threw me under the bus to her psycho mom. So I very calmly tell Ashley's mom that I pay half the rent, I'm a grown adult with a college degree, and she has absolutely no authority over me whatsoever. She starts going completely off about disrespect and how she practically raised me too, since Ashley and I have been friends since freshman year. Says I'm setting a terrible example and if I want to live like an irresponsible child, I'll be treated like one. That's when I completely lost my shit. I told her she had exactly five minutes to get her crazy helicopter butt out of my apartment before I called the cops for trespassing. I also informed her that she's permanently banned from having keys to a place where I pay $800 a month in rent. She started absolutely screaming about how she co signed the lease, so it's technically her apartment too, and she has every right to parent for girls. She's waving her arms around like a maniac. I pulled out my phone and called our landlord right there at eleven thirty PM, while she's still ranting, Mister Steve picks up. He's this cool older guy. Who's rented to college students for here's. I put it on speaker and explain the situation. Then ask who has legal authority over tenant decisions and apartment access. He immediately says the cosigner has absolutely no rights to control tenants, access the apartment without permission, or make decisions about how we live. what she's doing could be considered harassment and trespassing. Ashley's mom went completely pale. She started back.

What is the strangest slash creepiest thing you've ever seen or experienced? One, I'm a pool guy and I often go into people's backyards to clean their pools. One week, because of a holiday, I was cramming five days of work into four. On a hot summer day, I walked into a backyard, passed through both gates and was met with an unusual sight. Two people were completely unclothed and cuddling on a poolside recliner. I looked at them, they looked at me. I immediately turned around and they ran inside. I see the owners all the time, but I've never seen them before. The next week I went back and the wife was outside. We started chatting and I asked if she'd had any visitors recently. She said no. I let her know I saw some people in her backyard and she cut me off saying, yeah, surprised you haven't met them. Let me introduce you. They were brother and sister. They cancelled service within two months. 2. I used to volunteer for a wildlife rescue. I went to an elderly woman's house to pick up a baby bird she had found. When I arrived, she carefully uncovered it from the towel she had placed it in. It was just a Chestnut. 3, a couple of years ago, I worked for a cleaning company. On one of my first days, I was cleaning a woman's house and entered a room. On the second floor, the room was full of only clocks and mirrors. I've never been so aware of my own mortality. 4. Back when I was a door to door salesman, I had a couple of odd experiences. One guy gave me a tour of a massive backyard shed he used for fermenting wine. It was actually pretty interesting. He explained a lot about the process and what it was like running a home winery. He didn't buy anything for me, though. Another guy did buy for me, but when I stepped out to print his receipt, he was waiting for me when I returned wearing nothing but a very short bathrobe. The robe just so happened to fall open as he received his receipt. He then asked if I'd like to stay for coffee. I did not stay for coffee. 5. A few years ago, I volunteered with the City Council to help clean houses after a neighborhood flood. One house belonged to a couple who ran the local convenience store. They asked us to help remove water damaged carpet from the ground floor of their house. As we were removing the carpet, we noticed it extended in one piece under a closed door and into a locked room. We asked the lady of the house if she wanted us to cut the carpet at the door and leave that room untouched or if she wanted to open the door so we could remove the carpet there as Well, she replied, I'll check with my husband. That's his special room. This LED to some nervous, puzzled looks among our crew. What is a middle aged man who owns a convenience store keep in his special room? Eventually the wife came back with a set of keys and told us we could remove the carpet there. She unlocked the door and we all crowded around as it opened to reveal a room with carpet up the walls, a mirror ball on the ceiling, a stage at one end with a PA system, a projector and the fanciest karaoke machine I've ever seen. Special room indeed. 6. I used to install Dish Network for a living. One time I was installing for an elderly lady who complained that her sister's TV always showed the same thing as hers. I had a two TV installation order so I figured I could fix it. When I finished, I was demonstrating the system to her when she looked into a full length mirror and complained that her sister's TV was still showing the same thing. I noted out of there as fast as I could and left detailed notes on the account in case she called back. 7, I used to do pest control while baiting a house for roaches. I made my way to the bathroom. On top of the toilet tank there was a decorative bowl. Nothing unusual, right? Except the bowl wasn't full of extra toilet paper or washcloths. It Was full of white Cheddar Cheeto Puffs. 8. Not my job exactly, but I guess I was working. I had been divorced for a couple of years and was helping my girlfriend move into a new apartment. While putting stuff away in the kitchen, I found a 15 year old photo booth picture of my ex wife and her sister. They look to be in their early teens. Turns out my ex sister in law was the previous tenant and that was her junk drawer.

My 17 year old daughter Jade has been vegan for 3 years and I mean aggressively vegan. She once broke up with a guy because he ate a cheeseburger on their date. She named our chickens so we couldn't eat eggs. Last month, Jade got diagnosed with leukemia. The oncologist, Doctor Gabe, is this serious, no nonsense guy. He sits us down and says very gravely, Jade needs to increase her protein intake immediately. Her body needs complete proteins to handle chemotherapy. Jade crosses her arms. I'm not eating animals. Find another way, Doctor Gay blinks. Jade, this is life or death. You need at least 80 grams of protein daily. Then I'll die with a clear conscience. Next week was like a sitcom from hell. My wife tried sneaking chicken broth into Jade's soup. Jade took one sip, spit it out and yelled, mom, this tastes like blood. I attempted hiding ground Turkey in her spaghetti sauce. She took one bite, ran to the bathroom and came back with a toothbrush. I need to scrub the death from my mouth. We brought in a nutritionist who suggested protein powder. Jade screamed, way protein? That's cow juice powder. You're trying to turn me into a dairy vampire. By week two, Jade had lost 8 pounds and Doctor Gabe was getting desperate. He tried reasoning with her. Jade, even plants want to live. You're still ending life. Jade gasped. Dramatically, did you just compare a carrot to a cow? A carrot doesn't have feelings, Doctor Gabe. How do you know? Because carrots don't have faces. Then my wife had this brilliant idea. She went to this fancy vegan restaurant and explained the situation. The chef created these protein shakes that looked like green smoothies but were packed with pea protein, hemp hearts and spirulina. Jade drank them religiously, calling them her life force elixirs. Her protein levels shot up. But here's where it gets absolutely hilarious. Jade needed a minor surgery to insert her chemo port. When she woke up from anesthesia, she was completely loopy. The nurse brought her some chicken broth to help with nausea. Still high as a kite, Jade took a big sip and went, hmm, this is the best vegetable broth ever. What kind of vegetables taste this good? My wife and I are dying trying not to laugh. The nurse whispers. Should I tell her? I shake my head frantically. Jade finishes the entire cup and asks for more. This magical vegetable juice is healing my soul. I can feel the plants giving me their energy. She drank three more cups before the anesthesia wore off. When she finally came to her senses, she looked at the empty cups and asked, what was that amazing broth? The nurse, trying to keep a straight face, said, it was, um, special healing broth. I knew it. I could taste the life force. Vegetables are so Generous. We never told her the truth about her magical vegetable juice. But the, the real comedy came during her second chemo session. Jade was so nauseous she couldn't keep anything down. The hospital served her this sad piece of grilled chicken. Jade stared at it for 10 minutes. Then she looked at me and whispered, dad, I think the chicken is.

Her first response was excitement. She was thrilled that I could now buy her a puppy. 2, he didn't wipe his butt properly and had major skid marks in his underwear. One time he was wearing his pants plumber style and I saw a huge streak of brown going down his crack. When I told him about it, he said he only uses four squares of toilet paper because it's expensive. 3, her mom accidentally bought too much and wanted to drop off some groceries just in case her daughter needed anything. This woman came to her house with easily $200 to $300 worth of food, toiletries, drinks, soaps, even two bags of name brand beef jerky. It was obvious to me her mom didn't accidentally buy all this stuff. She did it because she loved her daughter and wanted to make sure she was taken care of. My ex then proceeded to yell at her mom and very rudely thanked her before making snide remarks about how she didn't like this brand or flavor. 4, as someone who dated a drinker for four years, I'm sure others have felt similar levels of disgust. The notable incidents were one time he drove home blackout drunk, parked in our neighbor's lawn and passed out on our porch. I found him there in the morning when I was heading to work. Another Time he blacked out, left our front door wide open and our dog got out. Two other times he blacked out and peed the bed. That last one pretty much ended it for me. After seeing what alcohol can do to someone, I can hardly drink at all anymore, which is probably for the best. Five, about 10 years and two children into our relationship, he actually said out loud, I didn't really consider women people until I watched you give birth. 6. We were on vacation in New York and staying in a hotel, which obviously had all white sheets. After laying down for a while, he got up to go to the bathroom and when I turned over, I saw green streaks on the bed where he had been lying. I almost threw up. 7. I once watched my middle school boyfriend eat Chef Boyard ravioli out of his bare hand. I was so nauseated by the sight that I, an immature seventh grader, tanked a relationship by fully ignoring him for two weeks until he broke up with me. I just couldn't look at him without remembering the sight of a ravioli piece sliding around in his palm. It still makes me sick. 8. We dated for months, always at my place. Then we ended up at hers once and I broke up with her. She wasn't clean and she had cats, one of which wasn't litter box trained. She had taught the cat to use the garbage. Disposal, yes. She taught the cat to dump in the freaking sink. That was not a long term solution to my loneliness. 9, he lived exclusively on sour cream and onion flavored chips and orange soda. He never brushed his teeth. 10, he decided he didn't need to wear deodorant during the summer in the American South because he believed he sweated out all his toxins and didn't smell bad anymore. He smelled like a cat pee salami and raw onion sandwich that had been left in a hot car over a long weekend. It was really quite a remarkable and complex bouquet of odors. I tried to politely and lovingly let him know that he was mistaken, but he didn't believe me. We broke up shortly after.

After my seven year old neighbor Eli knocked on my door at 6:00am holding a crumpled five dollar Bill and wearing his dad's oversized apron that dragged on the ground. Miss Kate, can you teach me how to make pancakes, he whispered, glancing nervously back at his house. It's my mom's birthday today and she's been crying a lot lately. I want to make her happy again. My heart absolutely shattered. His mom Lauren had been going through the world's messiest divorce. Her husband had clean out their bank account and disappeared three months ago, leaving her working double shifts at the diner just to keep their tiny apartment. I'd watched her stumble home exhausted every night, sometimes still in her waitress uniform. At midnight, of course, sweetheart, come on in. We spent the next two and a half hours in my kitchen. And let me tell you, this kid was absolutely determined. He stood on my step stool, tongue poking out in concentration as he carefully measured flour with a coffee mug because he couldn't reach my measuring cups. Pancakes have to be perfect circles, he explained with complete seriousness. Mom likes when things are neat and pretty. He insisted on cracking every egg himself, even though half the shells ended up in the bowl and we had to fish them out with a spoon. He practiced flipping the pancakes over and over, getting better each time when one broke apart. He'd sigh dramatically like a professional chef and start completely over. Then he disappeared into my backyard and came back with a handful of dandelions and some mint leaves from my herb garden. These are for decoration. Yellow is her favorite color and the mint smells like the soap she uses. By 8:00am, he had a plate of lopsided but genuinely beautiful pancakes arranged with the flowers like he was presenting them to actual royalty. He even folded a paper napkin into a fancy triangle. She's gonna be so happy, he said, carefully balancing the plate as he headed home. This is gonna be the best surprise ever. She'll forget about being sad. I watched through my kitchen window as he snuck through his front door holding that plate like it contained the crown jewels. Twenty minutes later, I heard yelling, then heartbreaking sobbing. I found Eli on his front steps, tears streaming down his face. The pancakes were scattered across the porch, syrup soaking into the concrete. The dandelions were trampled into the dirt. She threw them away. He hiccuped between. She said, I made a huge mess in her kitchen and she didn't have time to deal with my stupid nonsense. I wasted food and money and she has real problems to worry about, not kid games. I was absolutely livid. This innocent kid had spent his entire allowance and his whole morning trying to make his heartbroken mother smile, and she had completely destroyed his Spirit. But then I had a brilliant idea. Eli, wanna help me make pancakes for the whole neighborhood? I bet other kids would love to learn your special recipe. His eyes lit up immediately. We made dozens and dozens of pancakes. I put the word out on our neighborhood group chat and soon kids were lining up at my door with their parents. Everyone brought syrup, fruit, whipped cream, butter. It turned into this amazing impromptu block party on my front lawn. Eli was absolutely in his element, showing other kids.

So she's concerned that she's been friend zoned by you. I mean, she's got a great personality and I would like to be friends with her. Yeah. But the, I mean, the thing is, Michael, nobody's on dating apps to be friends. Like they're looking for dates. I guess that's true. But like, you know, sometimes you meet someone who you, who you click with on more of a friend level and, you know, you, you don't necessarily wanna date them, but you wanna continue being friends. Like I think men and women can be friends. So, you know. Well, I don't, I don't think there's any possibility of men and women ever being friends, ever. You do not believe that. The bottom line, you just feel like you guys are better off being friends and that's it. Yeah, she's very cute. You know, she's just not quite my type, I would say. Okay. So what's your type then? Uh, I mean, my friends always make fun of me for it. So, um, you know. Make fun of you for it. Yeah. Why they make fun of your type of person you like to date? You know, everybody has their type and I just have A different type than a lot of people. I'm dying to know. Is it an eye patch thing? Oh, God, I love people with eye patches. It's always been my thing. Tell me it's eye patches. Uh, no, not quite. I don't have a thing for pirates. I promise you we won't make fun of you if you tell us what your type is. I can trust you. No, of course you can't. But you should tell us anyway. Yeah. Is it like a physical thing or a personality thing? No, it's, it's physical. Okay. So what is it? Uh, okay. Here's the thing about Kara. Is Kara, again, great personality, really wonderful. Um, she has, you know, she's got a little bit too much back for me.

Not, not much. What are you all doing? Oh, just hanging out, you know, figured we'd give you a call and check in and see how your day is going. Okay. Why are you calling me? It's a great question. Well, I want to talk to you about something for a second, something you might not even remember. Okay. It happened back when you were in high school. Oh, gosh. Is this for real or like, is this a prank? No, this is not a prank. This is for real. Okay. This is a little different. Like. Okay. So there was a dude named Trevor that you went to high school with. Do you remember a guy named Trevor? Trevor in my class, yeah. Let me see if I can jog your memory a little bit. Okay. So you guys went to high school together. I guess he was in one of your classes. And one day you guys studied together. Okay. That still could be a lot of people. I'm thinking you might remember studying with this guy. He was a freshman and you were a sophomore. Okay. And I guess you guys had geometry together. Okay. And one day after school, you went over to his house to study. Okay. Okay. Nothing yet. Remember Trevor? No, not really. Okay. Um, well, the only other way that I think I could get you to remember him is he tried to impress you with a veggie tray. Oh my gosh. So you remember, you remember the veggie tray? I do. I do remember that. Oh, that was the karate guy. The karate veggie tray guy. Yeah. So, and Trevor actually emailed us because he wanted us to get a hold of you because he had a huge crush on you in high school and I guess still kind of has a crush on you and saw you on Facebook the other day and wanted to see if you'd go out with him. Yeah. Oh my god. Are you for real? Yeah, I am 100% serious. Yeah. He told us the whole story about how you asked him to study and it was like seriously the most memorable moment of all of his high school career. Oh god. Oh my god. That's so weird. Were you interested, were you interested in Trevor in high school or was that just a study session for you? I just needed to pass geometry and he, he was the smart guy. No doubt he was the smart kid. Was it obvious that he liked you though? I don't know. I mean, he was younger. So you know how it is like the younger guys, you know, look up to the older girls, right? And as a sophomore, you Don't want to date a freshman? I mean, come on. This whole thing was so long ago. I kind of remember that afternoon. It would be hard to forget with the veggie tray is, but, um, you know, it, it didn't get like totally weird until the next day when his mom called me. Wait, his mom called you? Yeah. Oh, my God. I've never told anybody about this. Yes. His mom called me and she told me that Trevor had been really, really upset and crying in his room. Oh, man. Oh, my gosh. And it was just all devastated. And she wanted me to make sure that I knew that, like, he was a really good kid and that, and they said that the veggie tray was her idea. Oh, my God. She said she actually calls you to let you know the veggie tray thing was hers. Yes. She said she was just trying to help her son on his first date. Oh, my God. I am mortified for him. Oh, my God. I was like dying because I'm like, this was not a date. I'm trying to explain to her, it's like I need to help with geometry. That's, it seems like we were actually just studying. That's all I wanted to go over there and do is study. Yeah. It, oh, gosh, it was crazy. And she went on and on about how all he wanted to do was kiss me and she was trying To help him. Oh, man. He didn't know what happened, like how it work these days. And so she was all so apologetic about the vegetables and like, it wasn't about the vegetable. Were you just stunned on the other end of the phone? I wouldn't even know what to say. I'm embarrassed. As a kid, it's so nerve wracking like when an adult call you in the first place. Right. But the end of the conversation, she was trying so hard. I mean, I guess it's kind of sweet that she offered to drive us to the movies if we wanted that, to have a date. And I was just like, um, no, thank you. Goodbye. Oh, my gosh. You could have destroyed him in high school sharing that story. No, I, but I didn't have the heart to do that because it's so tough anyway. And I remember that's why I didn't talk about it. I didn't tell him about it. That is nice of you. That's very, that's really nice of you not to put him on blast for his whole high school. You are. I wonder if he knows cause he didn't mention to us about his mom calling you. When we talk to him, I hope for his sake he doesn't know. He doesn't need to know. Well, whatever his mom told him, if he didn't know before, he knows now cause he's on the other line listening to this conversation. No. Yes. Trevor, what's Up

Um, like, it's kind of a long story. Um, you know, I just wanted you to know that it's not a big deal. Okay. But, um, when we first started dating, I was also seeing someone else and her name was Angie. And the thing is, was Angie? Yeah, it's completely over now.

So about a month ago, um, I gave him my phone to play a game with and he, Saw a text message from Angie and he was saying who's Angie? Who's Angie? And I just like gave him a dollar I was just like, you know, just doesn't matter it doesn't matter just you know move on and then he you know next time was like, I'm gonna tell her and give me more money and so it started small and it just got bigger and bigger it started with like one dollar and it's like five and then 10 you know wait a second you've been giving my son money so that he doesn't tell me that you've been seeing somebody else?

Hi. Can I speak to Isabella please? She's not here. Okay. Who am I speaking with? May I help you? Yeah, this is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. I'm moving 92.5. Who am I speaking with? This is Aaron. What? So what do you want to talk to Isabella about? This is Isabella's cell phone, correct? Yeah, she's just not home. Something I can do for you. Yeah. How? What? Um, first of all, who are you, Aaron? Who am I? Yeah, I'm Isabella's significant other. You're her boyfriend? Yeah, nice. How long you guys been together? I don't even know what you're calling about. Why do you want to know? Well, we do a segment on our show and it's gonna kind of be an awkward conversation here, Aaron. We do a segment on our show called The 2nd Date Update. Uh huh. And that's where if a listener of ours goes out on a date with somebody and ends up getting blown off, we get an email from them asking if we can call that person and ask why. So somebody sent us an email about Isabella that doesn't even make sense. How long have you someone? Yeah, somebody recently met Isabella and has been texting with her and thought that everything was going well and then Isabella kind of stopped responding to him and told them not to text anymore and they were hoping to get a second date. Um, are you in Are you in a person? We've been, we're together like, so there's no way she's going out on a date with someone else. Yeah, right. No, especially not recently. Hey, Aaron, I don't want to try to blow up her spot like this not might not be a bad thing. How long have you guys been together? Cause she could, it could be that you just recently met a guy or whatever. No, you know, it's not even possible. You we've been together for a long time on and off. So maybe during one of those off periods something could have happened. But even that seems unlikely. I know, I know this is probably a hard phone call to take and to hear. Not hard to hear, but it's doesn't make sense. Not even possible. Aaron, a guy emailed us and he's been texting with Isabella. They met at a party a few weeks ago, hung out, had a good time. He thought that she was into him and then she said, don't text me anymore and stop texting him. That's why he wanted us to call. Right? But I'm on her phone now. I've checked her phone. There's no text messages from any guy. Okay. I can assure you that. You check her phone all the time enough. We trust each other. Whatever, you know, I like trust. Two weeks ago, were you guys together or on a break? Cause you said you guys have breaks. Look, it's really None of your fucking business this point. It's not you don't even want to know if maybe your girlfriend is cheating on you. Who the fuck are you? I've already answered all of your dumb questions so I think you need to fuck off. I'm just trying to help you get to the bottom of it because this is the phone number that we got from another dude who said that he met Isabella look, if you have some guy that's calling you then why don't you tell him he's mistaken and he's got the wrong person and she's got a boyfriend and to just like back off and stop harassing her okay, I'll do that for you. Hey, Jake, back off. Isabella has a boyfriend. His name is Aaron. This is so uncomfortable Aaron Jake the guy who says he met Isabella is actually on the phone with us right now Jake, say hi to Aaron. Hey, so how long have you guys been dating? You never really answered that question. Who the fuck are you? I'm not even gonna answer this. I don't even know who you are. I don't wanna know who you are. You sound like a little bit of a dweeb and I don't think she has I I meant Isabella big deal dude. Oh, here's the deal. We hung out the whole night. She stayed in my bed but it doesn't sound like you guys are really into each other. You won't even say How long you've been dating? All right, dude, here's the deal. I don't know who the fuck you are. I don't have a problem with you, but you keep pushing down this road, we're gonna have a fucking problem. You need to back off. I don't know. What are we going on? You've made a mistake. All right, Jake, why don't we, why don't we just ask Isabella who she wants? Yeah, why don't we ask Isabella? Yeah, why don't we ask Isabella? Oh God, this is so uncomfortable, Aaron. I mean, I know you have her phone right now, but how can we get a hold of her? I'm not gonna give you any of your info. Where is she? She must be coming back soon. This is ridiculous. I am with Isabella. We are together. No, you can't talk to her. No, we're not gonna go through. I'm not gonna listen to this pseudo shrink try to tell me that my relationship isn't working out. All right, you may maybe radio show, maybe you guys weren't together two weeks ago. It was two weeks ago, Aaron. That's when Jake says he met Isabella and she spent the night at his house. In his bed. In his bed.

He asked about me? Yeah, he did more than ask about you. He emailed us to call you. Really? What do you say? Oh, my god. He said, uh, your voice is getting that high pitch thing, which is always a good thing when you talk about boys and you're a woman. Yeah. Sounds weird. You said, talk about boys and you're a woman? I don't know. Talk about men and you're a woman. That works for me. I don't know. Anyway, uh, males and you're female. Sorry, Susie. Um, wait, no. So tell me, what did Vic say?

Sounds like it's true. Well, I don't think it was the whole time. Okay, dude, if you were flirting with any man that was dressed as a clown for any amount of time, I feel like that means that you must like him a lot, because clowns are not easy to be attracted to. Unless you have a clown fetish. Susan, do you have a clown fetish? No, no, he was really cute. He wasn't wearing the nose or anything. Oh, my god, you sound excited. Um, I don't know. I just. I had a really good time. Um, and if you talk to him, could you tell him my mashed potatoes were running? Your mashed potatoes were running? Yes. What does that mean? I don't know what I mean. Hold up. It was just. It was just like an inside joke between us. Could you tell him that? Sure. Susan, shouldn't you tell him, like, you'd like to see him again or something? Not your mashed potatoes were running? Yeah, I just. I just want him to know because we were talking about it for a while, so. He'll get it. He'll get it. It's funny. It's funny.

I caught her cheating with another guy. So, you know, I thought I'd have a little fun. No way. Wait. So what did you do? I used a picture of some Other guy, I messaged her. We messaged back and forth. So I figured I'd send her a little wild goose chase two hours away. Oh my god. So you catfish your ex girlfriend basically pretty much all that work to just make her drive two hours away and sit at a pizza place by herself. Oh, yeah, it made me happy. Very happy. Ross, you've never heard of like the high road taken that she missed out on the high road about six months ago. So, you know, you sound really proud of yourself.

First, Maggie, who's on the phone to do a second date update today, just admitted to us that she has been with 30 guys in the last week. Impressive statistics, Maggie. Good job, girl. Yeah, thank you. If you missed the first part of the second date update, Maggie met this guy named Ray at a bar. They went out for a coffee date. After meeting up, she said everything was going well, but she made a joke to him. When he said, like, something along the lines of, I bet you go on a lot of dates, her response was, yeah, I've been on 30 dates in the past week. The only thing is, he didn't get the joke, and he just kind of sat there like, oh, my god. And that's why she thinks she's not getting a call back, because he still doesn't think that it's a joke. It's pretty hard to go out with that many people in one week. So hopefully, maybe, Maggie, we can get him to realize that and go out with you again. Are you ready to give him a call? Yes, for sure. This one's so weird to me because he asked you to go out to dinner at the end of the day. I mean, he was obviously complimenting your looks when he said, you must get asked out a lot. I don't get that one little joke would make him not call you. I know, I know. So I'm excited to see what the problem is. One little joke you didn't get? The fact that he was. If, like, he was thinking that you really went out with 30 guys in a week, that's bigger than a little joke. All right, you're right. I'm gonna dial his phone number right now and see if we can get him on the phone. Okay? Okay. Hello? Hi, can I speak to Ray, please? Yeah, this is Ray. Hey, Ray, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Who? Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. It's a radio show. Okay. How's it going? Fine. Any idea why I'm calling you? Uh, no. We recently got an email about you from one of our listeners. Okay. Her name is Maggie, and you recently went out on a date with Maggie. Okay. Okay. Do you remember that happening? Yeah. Okay, well, Maggie emailed us because she's wondering why you haven't given her a call back, especially at the end of the date when you were, like, talking about maybe meeting up for dinner or something. She hasn't heard from you, so she asked if maybe we could get you on the phone to find out why. Oh. Is there a reason you're not calling Maggie back? Uh, I mean, it's just. It's probably not gonna work out. Oh, Man, Ray, why is that? Uh, I don't know. I just. I don't Think we're. I don't think we're a good match. Is there a specific reason why you think that? Um. Ray, you're a hard guy to read. I agree. So what if. What? Why don't you. Why don't you think you guys would be a good match? I don't know. I mean, Maggie, she's a really nice girl.

No. The thing is, I saw him with a few other girls at the skate park. Oh, really? Probably just his friends. They look more than friends to me. What do you mean by that? I don't know. He was just very touchy. Okay, well, you stop it. Huh? You are obviously jealous and trying to give him a bad image. Um, I'm really not. I couldn't Care less.

My ex wife's family never liked me from day one. Her parents thought I was too rough around the edges, just a blue collar construction worker who dropped out of college. While their daughter Katie had her master's degree in education and came from old money, they made it crystal clear I wasn't good enough for their precious daughter. Her mom would make comments like, I hope you're planning to go back to school. And her dad would ask when I was going to get a real career instead of manual labor. When Katie and I divorced five years ago after eight years of marriage, her whole family practically threw a Celebration. Her mom actually said good riddance to that monster right in front of me. At the custody hearing, her dad told the judge I was a deadbeat who would never amount to anything and shouldn't have unsupervised visits with my daughter. They fought tooth and nail to keep me away from seven year old Emma, said I was too aggressive, too unpredictable, not the kind of role model a little girl needed in her life. The judge gave me every other weekend only. And even then, Katie's parents would show up to supervise my time with my own daughter. Her mom would sit in my living room during visits watching me like I might snap at any moment. She'd criticize everything from the food I served Emma to the movies we watched together made me feel like a criminal in my own home. After the divorce, I threw myself completely into work, started my own contracting business with a beat up truck and $5,000 in savings. I was determined to prove every single one of them wrong. To show Emma that her dad wasn't the failure they all said I was. I work 18 hour days, seven days a week, saved every penny, reinvested everything back into the business. I hired good guys, treated them fair, and we built a solid reputation for quality work, no corners cut, no shoddy materials, everything done right the first time. My little construction company grew faster than I ever imagined. Within 3 years, I was running the biggest residential contractor in our entire county. Emma was so proud when she'd visit and see the signs with my company name all over town on new developments and renovations. Meanwhile, Katie remarried some hot shot finance guy named Brad. They bought this massive house in the most expensive neighborhood, drove matching luxury cars, joined the country club where her parents were members. Her family absolutely loved him. Finally, a son in law worthy of their social status, posted constant photos on social media of their perfect new blended family. Brad taking Emma to fancy restaurants, vacations to Europe, all the things they said I could never provide. Her parents would comment on every post about how blessed Katie was to find Real stability. Then last month, my phone rang at midnight on a Tuesday. It was Katie crying so hard I could barely understand her. There'd been a terrible accident. I had been drinking at some business dinner and decided to drive home with Emma in the passenger seat. They hit a massive oak tree going 60 miles per hour on a back country road. Brad walked away with bruises, but Emma was rushed to the children's hospital in critical condition with internal bleeding, a collapsed lung and severe head trauma. The medical bills were absolutely astronomical. Brad's insurance had apparently lapsed because he forgot to make payments and Katie's teacher salary couldn't cover even a time.

Good night, Alex. Oh my gosh, that went amazing for real. I'm so happy. What did you guys do? We just honestly talked. We talked for like two hours straight and got to know each other so well. It was really nice. Yay! That's good. Yeah, it was actually funny too. Haha. Oh yeah. She brought you up and asked me if I knew you. What did you say to her? I said I heard of you but didn't really talk to you. Oh, why? Remember your plan? It would have gave it away. Oh yeah, you're right. Anyways, wanna hang out tomorrow? You can tell me all about her. Not tomorrow, Gwen. We're going bowling for real. Yeah, two dates back to back. I know, right? She's really special. Okay, I'm going out with my family. I might not be home until late.

You know, you can tell me anything. I don't want to be friends with you anymore. What? Haley saw you text my phone last night. She got so mad at me not because she's overprotective or anything, but because I lied. Remember when I said I don't talk to you and here I was texting you. Did you tell her we are best friends? Well, yes and no. What do you mean? I told her you think I'm your best friend, but you're just another girl to me. Why would you say that? Why didn't you just tell the truth? I did, but she's still making me pick between you and her. She said that if I want to date her, I need to stop talking to you and are you going To do that, Gwen, I'm not gonna lose the love of my life for just another girl. Well, yeah, thanks for finishing the sentence. At least you know your place. Alright, is this what she wants or what you want? What I want. Well, in that case, I'm not going to try to make myself mean something to you. All I have to say is, what about our promise? What promise that you would never forget about me? Promises are made to be broken.

All of my bags are packed. I'm ready. Do you wanna come over to my house or meet at the airport? Um, babe, yeah, don't tell me you forgot. Um, not really, but I thought Ava already told you told me. What? Are you okay? Is anyone hurt? Um, this is kind of awkward, but since the house can have 6 people in Ava and I thought maybe this trip should be, you know, just for us, me and all our friends. Huh? And since it's my birthday, I think I should have fun. What are you even saying? I'm at the airport right now. Where are both of you at? Well, we're already on the airplane with all our friends. We're going to the cabin beach house. What? How many of you are there and who are your friends? It's just me and Ava and four of her friends. Eric, Jamal, Tyrone, Leslie. What? Well, Ava was supposed to tell you. She's literally such a silly girl, babe. She definitely just forgot to tell you. Forgot to tell me what? That you won't go with us? And you're telling me this after I took a week? Off work and told my friends I'm going to a trip with my girl. Then prepared for a surprise. I won't tell you. On a trip that I fully paid for. Look, I'm so sorry, babe. All of my friends really appreciate you. We will love you. And they all said you're a great guy for this. They wanna hang out with you after this trip. I organized everything for both of us, me and you. I paid for everything. I only accepted Ava because you wanted her. Tell me you're joking, please. And that is so, so generous of you. I didn't think it would bother you that much, to be honest, because I know you're not an insecure boyfriend. This has nothing to do with insecure. I wanted to spend time with you. I was going to propose on your birthday. Mia, how can you do this? I'm really sorry, babe, but you're always so serious. This was my birthday and I wanted to have fun, make stupid decisions and get wasted. If I went with you, we won't go to the club, we won't ever drink and we will just go to fun places and swim all day. I only live once, babe, and I want to make the most of it. Just because I don't drink, it doesn't mean I'll stop you, right? But sometimes you have to let it go. I wanna make very stupid decisions. I don't want you to spoil the mood for Me? I'm only 22. Once in a lifetime. Sorry, babe. But I will make it up for you when I come back. You can propose to me. We should go to another trip, just me and you this time. Have as much fun as you want. Visit all the fun places, eat and swim all day. I still like you as a person. Adam, hello. Are you there, Adam? Sure. Have fun. Hey, babe. We're at the reception.

What do you do? Ignore it? Don't answer it? Not me. I like life. The other day my cell phone rang 9 1 7. That's a New York number. I didn't know who it was. I picked it up anyway. I hit talk. I said, hello. Guy in the line goes, hey, Bruce, what's going on? My name is Jay, not Bruce. So I said, nothing much, man. What's going on with you? And he said, I'll tell you what's going on. I just got an email about the budget. It's supposed to be 15,000, now it's 10,000. And I'd like to know what's up. I got excited in my chest. I grabbed the steering wheels like, okay, focus, your name is Bruce. There's a budget. It was 15,000, now it's 10,000. No one's happy about it. That's all we know. That's all we know. So I just repeated back to him what he said to me. And I go, 10,000 is supposed to be 15,000. He goes, yeah, I know. Well, I just got an email and now it's ten. I go, listen, man, I don't know what to tell you. I've been on the road all day. You know, I haven't even seen it. And he goes, did you send this out? I give him some attitude to Bruce. I didn't like it. I said, listen, man, the budget was 15,000. We had a couple extra expenditures. It Went up to 16 2 I reworked it, got it down to 14, 7 I had 300 to play with so I called it 15 and I sent it out and he goes, yeah, well now it's 10 man and I was like, oh my god, that worked. That worked phase one complete phase one complete. Like now I'm in the door. I have a 4:01 k. I was at the Christmas party okay, so he goes, did Larry okay this I go, listen man, I took the budget to Larry. Larry said it looked fine, but I knew it was my ass on the line so I ran it by Jennifer just in case, just a double check. Jennifer said it looked good. I sent it out. He goes, yeah, well now it's 10 man and I realized this guy has no idea what's going on over there. He hasn't talked to Larry. I know he hasn't talked to Bruce. He doesn't even recognize my voice. I know he didn't talk to Jennifer. I just made her up. So he goes, listen man, what are we gonna do about this? And I go, listen, I'm on the road right now. I haven't even seen the email. Why don't you give Larry a call, check in with him, see what he says, call me back. Just praying he will because that return phone call was going to be amazing and he goes, you know what? Why don't wait till you Get home, you check the email, you call Larry, you call me back and I go, nah, nah, bro. Larry knows way more about this than I do. Give him a call, call me back. He goes, okay, hangs up the phone, to which I explode with euphoria because there's a small business in New York that is crumbling to the ground over five grand and nobody can find Jennifer. They're looking, they're looking. I get home, I'm so excited. I take out my cell phone, I'm like, you know what? I'm gonna save that guy's number, give him a call in a couple days, touch base, you know what I mean? Check in, see where we're at, you know? So I save it in my phone under Random Guy. That's what he is. He's a random guy. Four or five days pass, I forget about it. Laying on my couch watching the ball game, phone rings in the dining room table. I get up watching the game, grab the phone, watching the game, look down, random guy.

My younger sister, Ariana turned into a homewrecker the moment my husband Kevin, slipped the ring on my finger and started a desperate pick me routine. If Kevin were blue, she'd show up in blue. If you mentioned liking something, she'd become an expert overnight. If you posted about a restaurant, she coincidentally appeared during our date. It started subtle, almost innocent, even like sitting next to Kevin at every family dinner, Ariana would squeeze between us, claiming she couldn't hear from the other end. I didn't mind since family is family. But after six months, it got obvious. Kevin joined a gym near his office. Ariana got a membership there the next day, showing up during his workout times in tiny sports bras. Kevin mentioned liking astronomy once. Suddenly, Ariana was texting him NASA articles daily, asking, can you explain this to me? Then came the fake emergencies. Her car broke down near Kevin's office. Her apartment had a gas leak when I was out of town. She needed help moving heavy boxes that turned out to be empty, Kevin always told me, immediately showing me her texts with eye rolls. She's just young and confused, he'd say. And I agreed until she officially went too far. A hard knock at 9:00am and there stood Ariana in a tiny white sundress, full makeup, hair curled like a magazine. Shoot, I need Kevin's help moving furniture, she announced, pushing past me. Where is he? But we both knew she lived in a furnished apartment. I was about to tell her to leave when she added, I'm sure you have errands to run. You can go away now. She was literally trying to dismiss me from my own home. Kevin came downstairs and she immediately grabbed his arm. Oh, perfect. You're already dressed. I promise I'll return him in one piece. She actually winked at me. I felt my chest burn with rage, but then had a different thought. I headed upstairs, loudly saying, I need to take a bath. But I didn't leave or go to the bathroom. I stayed upstairs where I could hear everything through the vents. Didn't waste any time. Oh, my God, Kevin, you're so muscular, she giggled, clearly touching his arm. Do you work out every day? I bet you could lift me with one hand. Wanna try? I rolled my eyes. This girl had zero shame. I kept folding laundry, waiting for Kevin's polite deflection.

My heart was pounding so hard I thought it would break my ribs. I was driving back from a pickup with 5 pounds in my trunk when I saw those flashing lights behind me. I wasn't even speeding. I've been so careful, driving exactly at the limit, using my turn signals, stopping completely at every stop sign. But there they were anyway, those red and blue lights flashing in my mirror. This wasn't my usual route. I normally took back roads, but there was construction and I had to detour through this small town I'd never been through before. I pulled over, trying to keep my hands from shaking. I could feel sweat forming on my forehead as I watched the officer in my side mirror. He sat in his car for what felt like forever, probably running my plates. Each second stretched like an hour. I glanced at the duffel bag on my passenger seat. Inside was just my gym stuff. But in my trunk, five whole pounds, the biggest amount I'd ever moved, enough to put me away. For years, this was supposed to be my last run. I'd been saving up for culinary school, my actual dream. I told myself just one more big score and I'd be done, clean, start new life. Now it was all about to come crashing down because of a random traffic stop in a town I'd never even heard Of before today. The officer finally got out and walked up real slow. License and registration. Know why I stopped you? His voice was calm, almost friendly, which somehow made it worse. I handed over my stuff with a slightly trembling.

The words cut through me like a knife. During our friend's dinner party, eight people around the table went completely silent, their eyes darting between us while I forced the most uncomfortable laugh of my life. Well, thanks for the brutal honesty I managed reaching for my wine glass with a hand that was definitely shaking. Vanessa just shrugged, not even looking embarrassed. I mean, come on, Luke, you work the night shift at a gas station. I have standards. She said it like I wasn't even sitting right there. Her friends Courtney and Kimberly exchanged glances. These were the same friends who constantly bragged about their lawyer and doctor boyfriends, the ones Vanessa always compared me to. I've been saving every single penny from those overnight shifts, living on ramen and store brand everything just to buy her the ring I've been looking at for months. Three years together. And she'd never talked about my job like that. Sure, it wasn't glamorous, but I worked my ass off, 60 hour weeks dealing with drunk customers and gas and go thief, all while taking business classes online during my breaks. That night, I couldn't sleep. Her words kept replaying in my head like a broken record. Last person I'd marry. The worst part, she'd said it so casually like stating the weather. The next morning my phone rang at 7:00am. My manager Greg sounding more excited than I'd ever heard. Him, Luke, you sitting down. The station's been sold. Some big development company bought the whole block. Their putting in a shopping mall. I rubbed my eyes, still half asleep. Okay, so we're all fired. Not exactly. See, there's this thing called a settlement payout. You've been here five years full time employee. So according to the lawyers, he paused for dramatic effect. Your check should be around $850,000. I dropped a phone. $850,000 from pumping gas and restocking energy drinks. Life changing money that would let me start the business I've been dreaming about, maybe even buy a house. But I didn't tell Vanessa immediately. Something about her comment made me want to wait and watch, see who she really was when she thought I was still just the broke gas station guy. Over the next week, I observed her like a scientist studying a specimen. She complained about our cheap dates at Applebee's, rolled her eyes when I suggested cooking dinner instead of ordering take out, made little passive aggressive digs about my dead end job and lack of ambition. My sister's boyfriend just got promoted to part partner, she mentioned Tuesday night scrolling through Instagram. They're looking at houses in Westfield. Now that's nice, I said. Watching her face, yeah, it's just nice to see someone with actual goals, Friday night she came home with shopping bags from expensive stores. Where'd you get the money for that, I asked. Oh, my mom helped out, said I deserve to treat myself. She avoided eye contact. I later found the credit card.

I was on my first tinder date ever. So excited to meet Julie. I didn't even know if she was real. But as I sat there, she finally walked in. I'm so sorry I was late. My mom was supposed to watch my daughter Liz. She's six. She sat down, and I could tell she was nervous. I had no idea she had a daughter. She asked if I was still okay with dating her, and I told her I was actually excited she had a kid because I'd always wanted to be a dad. She showed me a picture. She's been through a lot with a divorce and immediately changed the subject, like she revealed too much. We talked for two hours about everything except her family. And I noticed how she flinched every time her phone buzzed, glancing at it like it might explode. When I walked her to her car, she turned to me with this desperate look and said, if this goes somewhere, if we keep seeing each other, would you really be okay meeting Lizzie? I said, yes, of course. And she kissed me like she was drowning and I was air. I should have recognized that desperation. I should have known. Three weeks later, I got to meet her. I went over to their house, and as soon as she opened the door, I saw the sweetest girl ever. I could tell She was excited to meet me, too. We had dinner together. But I could tell she was more than nervous. I couldn't figure out what was wrong at the time. Then I started looking around. No kids artwork on the fridge. No toys anywhere. Just one school photo on the mantle. Like a museum piece. Julie was different, too. Talking too fast, drinking too much wine. Her phone lighting up every few minutes with mom on the screen. She kept rejecting the calls, each time, her hand shaking worse. When she went to the bathroom, I saw a text. If you answer your phone now, or I'm coming over. Julie came back with fresh lipstick, mascara slightly smudged. And when I asked if everything was okay, she kissed me so hard I tasted blood. Everything's perfect, she said. But her eyes were screaming. My phone rang at eleven PM on a Thursday. Unknown number. I almost didn't answer, but something made me pick up. David. The tiniest voice, barely a whisper. It's Lizzie. From. From Julie's house. My blood went cold. Lizzie, where are you? Where's your mom? There was a long pause, then. I'm at the hospital. The nurse let me use her phone. Mommy doesn't know I'm here. I was already grabbing my keys. Happened. Sweetheart. Another pause, and when she spoke again, I could hear her trying not to cry. She pushed me down the stairs. I drove like a maniac. This six year old girl calling Me, practically a stranger because she had nobody else. I found her sitting there at the hospital, and the nurse came and got me before I could say anything. She had suspected something was off. She insisted on calling you, she said quietly. Wouldn't let us call her mother. I sat with Lizzie while she told me everything. Years of hidden abuse. Julie's perfect mother act for the outside world. The threats, the careful injuries where bruises wouldn't show. How she'd Learned to hide the pain, to lie to teachers, to protect the mother who hurt her. She tells everyone I'm clumsy, Lizzie whispered. That I'm difficult. But I'm not difficult, am I? I held this brave little girl while she. I made her a promise. I'm going to make sure she never hurts you again. The police arrived within an hour, but Julie got there first. She burst in, playing the worried mother perfectly. Tears, trembling hands gathering Liz into a hug that made the girl go rigid with fear. My baby. I was so worried. I went to check on you when you were gone. The performance was flawless. When I tried to tell the officers what Liz had told me, Julie's face transformed. This man has been dating me for barely a month, she said, voice dripping concern. I think he's trying to come between me and my daughter. He's been asking strange questions about her. The officers exchanged looks. She called me. I insisted. Children say Things, Julie interrupted smoothly.

I was in science class when I grabbed what I thought was my granola bar from my bag. One bite and I knew something was wrong. The taste. Peanut butter. My friend's protein bar must have gotten mixed up with mine when we studied together. I need the emergency Epipen. I gasped, already feeling my throat tighten. I just ate peanuts. The substitute teacher looked up from her desk, where she was eating from her own bag of peanuts. Don't be dramatic. Allergies are all in your head. you don't understand. My tongue was already swelling. I left my Epipen at home, thinking I'd be fine since every classroom had emergency ones. Please, the med cabinet. Sit down. She stood up and walked to the cabinet, but instead of opening it, she leaned against it. You know what my parents did when I claimed I was allergic? The cats. They locked me in a room with three of them. By morning, I was cured. Katie jumped up and ran toward the cabinet. She's not faking. She needs help now. The sub blocked her. The only thing killing her is her own mind. Then she did something I'll never forget. She walked to the door, turned the dead bolt, and pocketed the key. No one leaves until she admits she's faking it. This victim mentality is destroying your generation. Call 9 1 1! Someone yelled, reaching for their Phone! Phones in the box. Now! The sub grabs the collection box, or you're all suspended. My throat felt like someone was tightening a belt around it. Six minutes. That's all I had before the swelling became irreversible. The number my doctor made me memorize. That's when my ex, Daniel, decided to chime in. She pulled the same drama last year. The sub smiled at him. See? Even he knows you're faking. She walked back to my desk with her bag of peanuts. My parents proved allergies are psychological. When I was five, she grabbed a handful and slowly, deliberately crushed them over my desk. Exposure therapy. This is for your own good. The dust fell everywhere. Blood started dripping from my nose. My lips were swelling. Katie screamed, look at her! The sub shoved Katie back down. Psychosomatic reaction. She believes she's dying, so her body mimics it. That's when Tommy touched his neck. And I guess he was allergic, too, because his eyes started swelling shut. I can't see! I can't see! Everyone lost it. Kids were dumping entire backpacks on the floor, throwing contents everywhere. Does anyone have an Epipen? Sarah was sobbing, using her shirt to wipe blood from my nose. Please don't die. Please don't die. Jack ran to the door and started pulling on it. Open this right now, please! The sub laughed. Sit down or you're expelled. Jack kept yanking on the door handle, the whole frame rattling. Help! Somebody! Other kids joined. Him pounding on the door with their fists. Through the door window, Mister Peterson from next door looked in. The sub stepped in front of the window, blocking his view, and gave a thumbs up before closing the blind. He walked away. This is kidnapping! Katie screamed. Three minutes left. Blood dripped from my nose onto my desk. Tommy was clawing at his throat. Lisa was in the corner, vomiting from pure panic. Two girls were huddled together, crying. Some kids just sat frozen at their desks, unable to move. The sub actually laughed. Oscar worthy performance, though a bit over the top with the fake blood. My situation ship. Jack tried to give me mouth to mouth while I was still conscious and choking. My ex, Daniel tackled him to the ground. I know her better. Yeah, that's why you called her dramatic. Jack shot back. Look at this. Fighting over the attention seeker. The sub ate another peanut. This is exactly what she wanted. I could feel myself turning blue. Foam bubbled at the corners of my mouth. Katie smashed the med cabinet with a chair. The sub grabbed her wrist. Destruction of property. That's expulsion. She's dying. Mike tackled the sub from behind. You wanna go to jail for assault? I'll press charges on all of you. I got out of my chair and couldn't even stand anymore. The fire extinguisher on the wall was my only thought. I literally had to crawl over on all fours. Just to get there. Look at her performance. The sub cackled, crawling for sympathy. My body didn't feel like it was mine anymore. One second I was getting ready to throw the fire extinguisher.

My 11 year old son destroyed $8,000 worth of school property in front of 500 parents, and I couldn't be more proud. The principal's voicemail came through while I was sitting in the emergency room. We were supposed to be at the talent show in an hour, but my mom needed X rays after falling down the stairs. The message said, your son destroyed school property. Call immediately in a thunderous tone that made my bones quiver. I told the nurse I'd be right back and drove to the school, my hands gripping the steering wheel so tight that my knuckles went white. My son had never been in trouble at school before, and I had no idea what he possibly could have done to make the principal that mad. Parking lot was chaos with parents scattered everywhere, and I could hear people shouting inside. When I found my son sitting outside the principal's office, he was completely calm, eating chips, while other parents were literally screaming at the principal through the door. Tell me what happened before they come out here, I said, kneeling down to look him in the eyes. He pulled out his phone and showed me a video, saying, watch this first, because nobody's going to believe me without proof. The video showed three boys huddled around a laptop, and one was saying, when Joey starts stuttering on let it go, we'll have the Whole thing ready to loop through the speakers. My dad already showed me how to override the soundboard. My son swiped to another video showing the same kids testing their setup during yesterday's rehearsal. And when a kid

Last month, our school's vice principal, Osborne, pulled me out of first period for wearing my new Rue 21 Lightning McQueen shirt to school. Your shirt is too distracting and childish. This is a place of education. My mom had to leave work just to bring me new clothes. She couldn't believe it. It's a cartoon car. Are you serious? What about them? She pointed to the three volleyball players sitting in the office wearing neon green Nike sports bras. That's different. Those are school approved athletic wear. The next few days went the same way. Sent home for wearing a knee length skirt with leggings underneath while cheerleaders walked around in uniform mini skirts. Sent home again for a simple black headband that kept my hair out of my face, while the quarterback behind me wore three gold chains, Nike headband, and matching wristbands. Excuses were always the same. Their school sanctioned. This time they sent me home with an expulsion warning and a student handbook. Mom and I scoured through it together. There's nothing in here about headbands or layering or cartoon characters! She yelled, absolutely fuming. She took a deep breath and looked at me with a determined expression. Well, if you're going to get into trouble, you might as well enjoy it. That night, we went shopping on Amazon, giggling and imagining Osborne's face. On Monday The following week, I showed up in a full NASCAR Racing jumpsuit. The moment Osborne saw me in the hallway, his face went red. What are you wearing? I smiled sweetly. It's not childish.

My twin brother Brandon, got our family restaurant when dad retired, even though I'd worked there every day for eight years while he was off finding himself in Europe. Growing up, the difference was obvious. Brandon was the golden boy, quarterback, prom king, the one who could make dad laugh until he cried. I was the serious one, the one who actually showed up. When Brandon graduated high school, dad handed him a backpack full of cash. Go see the world, son. Find your passion. When I graduated with a 4.0 GPA, Dad handed me an apron. Nathan needs to learn the business from the ground up. So while Brandon was posting Instagram photos from Italian beaches, I was learning every aspect of our family restaurant. I memorized recipe is that had been in our family for three generations. I built relationships with suppliers, negotiated better deals, and created systems that actually worked. Brandon was the charming one who customers remembered, but I was the one who made sure their food was perfect, their service was fast, and their experience was worth coming back for. When dad started talking about retirement, I assumed the restaurant would be mine. I'd earned it. I bled for it. I'd given up college scholarships to keep. Keep running. The announcement came at Sunday dinner with the whole extended family present. Dad stood up, clinked his wine glass, and smiled at Brandon. I'm proud to announce that Brandon will Be taking over the restaurant. He's got the personality this business needs to really grow. Brandon looked genuinely shocked. But Dad, Nathan does everything. I barely know how the kitchen works. Dad waved him off. You'll learn the operations. The restaurant needs a face, not a worker Bee. Nathan can stay on as kitchen manager. Kitchen manager? After eight years of running the place? While dad played golf, I kept my mouth shut.

Tiffany spent every weekend at yoga retreats that cost eight hundred dollars each. I covered rent, utilities, groceries, her car payment, everything. While she blew her entire salary on wellness. These retreats are healing my childhood trauma, she said when I questioned the expenses. If you can't support my spiritual growth, then leave. The thing was, I genuinely wanted to support her. Thirty two hundred dollars a month on retreats while I worked over for time to cover our life. Something felt off. Fine, I said. I'll leave. She laughed. Over some yoga classes? Seriously? Over you telling me to leave instead of having an adult conversation about money? While packing my stuff, I found her retreat receipt stuffed in a shoebox. Decided to look up the address of her latest transformative healing center. It was a luxury resort in Napa Valley, not a yoga studio. Five star review. Use for romantic getaways and couples packages. Then I found the photos she'd been hiding in a folder labeled Work Stuff. My best friend Justin was in every single one. Champagne dinners, couples massages, sunset photos with their arms around each other. They've been having affairs at these retreats for eight months on my dime. And my hands were shaking as I screenshot everything. Justin was married to Rebecca, who I'd known since college. Sweet girl who worked two jobs to support Justin's business consulting trips. The same exact weekends as Tiffany's retreats. I sent everything to Rebecca with a simple message. I think we need to talk. She called within minutes, crying. She'd been funding Justin's affair the entire time, just like I've been funding Tiffany's. Monday morning, I moved out early while Tiffany was still asleep. Took my car that she'd been using daily, my furniture, everything I bought for our apartment. Left her a note. As suggested. I left your healing journey continue.

When I was eight, I broke my arm falling off my bike. Instead of comforting me, my mom's first words were, great, now we have to deal with hospital bills. My dad just sighed and said, this is so inconvenient. I thought this was normal until I saw how my friend's parents acted. When my friend Jessica scraped her knee at my house, her mom rushed over, hugged her, and made sure she was okay. My parents just watched from the couch. But the real nightmare started when I turned 14 and got my first job at a local cafe. My parents were suddenly very interested in my work schedule. How much are you making? When do you get paid? You should give us your paychecks for safekeeping. I was naive and thought they were being responsible parents. I handed over every paycheck for two years. We're putting this in a special account for your college fund, they said. You'll thank us later. I worked 20 hours a week while maintaining straight A's. I was exhausted, but I. I felt good knowing I was saving for college. Last month, I decided to check on my college fund. I asked My parents. For the account information, so I could see how much I'd saved. That's when their masks slipped. What college fund? My mom said with this cold smile. The money from my job. You said you were saving it for college. My dad laughed. Actually laughed.

I asked to see the security footage. They refused, saying it was clear enough for them. When I requested to speak with the other student, they said that wasn't necessary. We have all the evidence we need, the principal stated firmly. Something felt wrong. My daughter had never even taken a cookie without asking. I took her home and asked her to walk me through exactly what happened. She said she'd gone to get her water bottle from her backpack when another girl started screaming that her money was gone. Everyone was looking at me like I was bad, she sobbed. The teacher had immediately searched my daughter's backpack, but found nothing. Still, they assumed she'd already hidden the money somewhere else. I called the school to ask more questions. The secretary told me the other girl, Madison, was the daughter of a school board Member when I asked about the security footage again, they said it only showed students near the backpack area, not actually taking anything. I spent the evening researching my rights as a parent.

When Mrs. Chen Hung Bird feeders, Harold reported them as attracting vermin and got her fined seventy five dollars. Created a three ring binder with color coded tabs for each house.

We'd ordered wings from three different places, set up multiple TVs in the living room, and I'd spent weeks organizing our fantasy draft.

Called a tow truck during the first quarter without knocking. Had Mike's car hauled away while we were watching the game. Even stood outside taking photos to document the violation for his records. He literally destroyed our gathering. Over six inches of mail.

I was about to give her a good night kiss, but then I realized we've been day it for a while, and I got a little excited. I kind of got this weird burst of confidence. So I leaned over her, put my hand against the wall, and I laughed. And I said, what about you give me a blowjob? And she was, like, horrified of my statement. She was like, what? Are you crazy? My parents will see us. And I was like, ah, come on, who's gonna see us? It's midnight. And she was like, no, are you crazy? What if they do? I was persistent. I was like, ah, don't worry about it. Nobody's around. They're all asleep. And she was like, no, it's still too risky. So I tried one last time. I was like, ah, come on, if you love me, you do it. And she was like, no, I. Listen, I love you, but I'm not gonna do it. Then all of a sudden, this light from upstairs turns on, and we hear somebody coming down the stairs. And when she opened the door, it was her sister. He came downstairs on her shorts, one her hair looks all messy. And she looked kind of mad. And then she started speaking, and I realized that she was just woken up. She said, listen, dad said, just give him a blowjob. If you Don't want to. I'll do it. Dad said that he'll come downstairs and do it if he has to. But please, for God's sake, tell him to take his hand off the intercom.

Turns out I got her pregnant. I was so scared to ruin my marriage. I told her to go back to Italy to have the baby. Told if you have it in Italy, I'll give you 25,000 up front and I'll pay child support every month until the kid is 18. She was skeptical at first, but eventually she agreed. But then she was like, but how would you know when the baby is born? And honestly, that was a good question. So I thought about it for a second. I was like, well, when a baby is born, send me a postcard and on the back of it write spaghetti. And I told, I said, once I received that postcard, I'll start sending the child support money. And one day, about nine months later, I come home to my confused wife. Soon as I walked in, she was like, already there's this weird postcard made out to you. And I was like, just give me it. I'll explain it later. And obviously she agreed. But when I read the card, I literally passed out. And I woke up three hours later in the hospital. When I woke up, I asked my wife if she, so I had the postcard with her. And she said yes. So I said, please give me that. I thought I was seeing things. But when I read the card again, now it Was serious. The card read, spaghetti, spaghetti, spaghetti, 2 with meatballs, 1 without send extra sauce.

Well, one day my mom was in the kitchen making dinner, and I thought that was a great opportunity to ask her, could she buy me a bike for my birthday? So my mom asked me, did I really think I deserved a present? And of course, I thought I did. But my mother wanted me to reflect on my behavior over the last year, so she sent me to my bedroom. Then she told me to write a letter to god and tell him why I deserved a bike for my birthday. And of course, I got angry, but I still went upstairs to my bedroom and started writing a letter to God. I said, dear God, I have been a good girl this year and I would like a bike for my birthday. And after I wrote that, I started feeling guilty because I haven't been a good girl that year. So I just tore up the letter and started over. Now, on the second letter, I said, dear God, this is your friend Taylor. I have been a good girl this year and I would like a pink bike for my birthday. And I knew that wasn't true either. So I tore up the letter and started again. Now this is my Third letter, I said, dear God, I have been okay girl this year. I still would really like a bike for my birthday. I started thinking about it. Then I said to myself, I can't send this letter to God either. So I started on my fourth one. I said, dear God, I know I haven't been a good girl this year and I am so sorry, but I will be a good girl if you just send me a bike for my birthday. And after carefully reading that, I just knew that letter was not going to get me a bike. I got upset and then I went downstairs to tell my mom that I wanted to go to church. And that made my mom happy. She thought her plan was working, so she allowed me to go. As soon as I got to the church, I went up to the altar. I started looking around to see if anyone was there. And then I bent down to pick up a statue of Mary. I slipped the statue under my shirt and ran out of the church. And as soon as I got home, I went up to my bedroom and I sat down with a piece of paper and a pen about to write another letter to God. So I started writing. I said, dear God, I kidnapped your mama. If you want to see her again, send me the bike.

That's enough to download all of Netflix in one second. Holy shit. How did they even figure that out? And I know the rage raiders are gonna be like, place versus place in Japan, all. But, bro, the average download speed in the US is about 300 megabytes per second. If you look at a chart comparing megabytes to petabytes, to even get to a petabyte from a megabyte, you had to convert megabytes to gigabytes, and one gigabyte is 1,000 megabytes. Then to get to a terabyte, you have to get to 1,000 gigabytes. Then after that, you have to do 1,000 terabytes to get to a petabyte. If you do the math, that is easily over three and a half million times the average speed in the US. Like, you can't tell me that's not insane. Bro, I'm trying to figure out what. Like, what are they gonna do with this much data, this much information? Like, they must be planning something huge, bro.

I'm like, I get that, but making him call you dad ain't the way. He said, as long as I'm smashing his mama, he gonna have to call me dad. Um, say less. I took the top off of his mama earn right in front of him and start smashing. I said, well, since I'm about to come inside your mama, you gonna call me daddy, right? I'm your dad.

Look at this, it's gorgeous outside so now you have a fun little crapshoot of well, do I sleep all day because I did work last night or do I stay up for 24 hours? If I sleep all day, I'm gonna waste this wonderful opportunity to hang out with my family however, if I don't sleep all day, my family is probably not gonna wanna hang out with me and because for us on night shift, your day off starts the moment you get off work. You're the only people who understand that yesterday is today and tomorrow all in the same 24 hour period then you always get hit with that crazy curve ball of well, when are you gonna mow the grass? But you stay up, you mow the grass, you go to your doctor's appointments, you go get your haircut but by the time the people that you wanna people with are actually ready to people you're exhausted oh man, let's go do something it's only 7:00 I have legitimately been up for 48 hours or in my case you get home and the family still asleep you fall asleep on the sofa, it's only been two hours they're waking you up asking you if you're gonna sleep all day chug down whatever Starbucks mocha latte that your Wife got for you and now you're a walking zombie inside of a Hobby Lobby. Promise you it's not RBF. This is just what night shifts face look like. Well, I won't tell her that I don't want to go shopping with her. My face will say it loud and clear. That's the beauty of being a night shift parent. You don't get to take a day off from being a parent. You just get a little cat nap here and there and it is like highly functioning narcolepsy. I've seen day walkers fall asleep at church. Don't get mad at me for falling asleep at a t ball game. And what was your favorite part of my game? All of it. I loved all of it. Now let's go get you that ice cream cone. Don't know what you don't know. But if you were a kid who have ever heard the words, shh, you gotta be quiet. Mom and dad are trying to sleep. Understand mom and dad love you so very much. That's why they are out here doing this in the first place. Say night shifts, not for the faint of heart, but I say you actually have to have a relatively large heart to be on night shift. The amount of caffeine we consume alone, what makes you think that you have an enlarged heart functioning solely off of caffeine, nicotine and hopes and dreams. Why do you have to sleep on your days off? But not when you go to work. I hate all those people. I don't care if I make them mad. Families of people who work night shift, if you give us a little bit, we'll give you a lot.

After 5 seconds of silence, the judge was like, you are also charged with beating your daughter to death with a shovel. And again, without missing the beat, the voice in the back of the courtroom yells, bastard. At this point you can tell that the judge was kind of upset. He stopped and he looked at the man in the back. The judge was like, listen, I understand, yeah, anger, your frustration, but we can't have these outbursts in my courtroom. Next time you do it, you'll be charged with contempt. Do you understand? The guy in the back of the courtroom looked at the judge and stood up and at this point you can tell that the energy in that courtroom just completely changed before he could say anything. I guess the security guards took him as a threat so they ran up to him and grabbed him. Now at this point the judge was like, no, let him go. I want to hear what he has to say. Now I'm not gonna lie, at this point I was a little scared cause he look crazy and I don't wanna die at jury duty. But anyways, the guy was like, listen, I've lived next to this. Low life for 15 years. And every time I asked him for a shovel, he said he didn't have one.

And what, just a couple hours ago, Bonnie Blue ended up uploading a video onto one of her social media platforms. The video. She was in jail. And it basically was revealed that the entire, you know, video of her getting arrested and what not, what stage, then she just, you know, did it for publicity for one of her new films she is doing. You know what I mean by films? So, sadly, all of this was just staged. You know, these are just actors or whatever. These are not real police. She was just being arrested for a new film that she's filming, you know, in prison, probably having prisoners. Do you know what? So, yeah, sucks. Wish she actually got arrested for real. But curious to know your thoughts about All this

Bonnie claimed at the time that she would have sex with 200 men in 12 hours in front of the live camera and each man would receive a reward of $100,000. She surpassed the adult record set by Lisa Sparks in 2004, which is why Bonnie will be arrested on May 21st, 2,025. And this farce of breaking the world record quickly turned into a disaster. Her behavior not only severely destroyed her body, but also brought great negative effects. Although she is only in her 20s, she looks like a middle aged woman in her 40s and she looks exhausted and unconscious. And it is said that she can't even walk on her own. Her sister then posted a video of her arrest on Instagram, which caused more controversy. Some viewers expressed shock while others applauded her for being dealt with, saying that her behavior was for exposure. Meanwhile, Bonnie's legal team began to fight back. Her lawyer claimed that the allegations were greatly exaggerated and insisted that she would eventually clear her name. But the more critical question is why this behaviour is considered a viable path to fame. Today, Bonnie's story is not just a scandal, it is a disease of the times.

And if you guys are unaware of what happened, well, a large group of Liberal protesters saw a bunch of federal agents show up, and they just decided, we're not gonna have this ice bullshit around here anymore. So they pressed in on these agents, decided to throw shit and attack them. Now, little did they know, those federal agents, they weren't there to arrest illegal immigrants. No, they were there doing the other part of their job, which was raid that house for human and drug trafficking. Oh, and what was the result of the raid? Well, not only did they save eight people from being human traffic, but they also found 900 pounds of meth, almost half a ton of methamphetamines. And here's the best part. After they saved those people and after they captured those drugs, all the people that were attacking them were arrested. And they're not gonna be charged with just having a violent protest. They're not gonna be charged with just standing up for your right. No, they're gonna be charged with trying to interfere with the rescue of human beings and the capture of 1,000 pounds of methamphetamines. Like, come on, liberals, just admit it's not about protecting the illegals. You just like attacking cops.

Now, Moscov is no longer in the NBA, but when he was, he was a rotational center and he was a good rotational center, but he was making rotational center money. So he wasn't getting a crazy bag or anything. He spends the early parts of his career being a solid backup. But then all of a sudden during the 2014, 2015 season, he catches a break. Turns out the Cavs with Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving and LeBron James need a backup big. And guess who they trade for? He plays for the Cavs for the next two years and ends up being part of one of the most legendary championship teams in 2016. So he gets his ring in 2016, but then after that season, he becomes a free agent in that offseason because everybody was getting overpaid. He got a four year, 64 million dollar deal from the Lakers. So this dude was a backup by chance, wins one of the most legendary rings of all time, gets a ridiculously huge bag and then gets to move from Cleveland to LA if that is not the dream career path, I don't know what is.

You see, it all started three years ago when the Lions realized that half of the people who came to a game entered through one gate. This meant that 33,000 people would stand in the line so long it reached the next closest gate at Ford Field. So through a combination of better signs, new ticket scanners and dynamic emails targeted to fans based on seat location, they were able to reduce entrances at Gate a by 5%, all while increasing their total attendance this year. But that's nothing compared to the other things they're working on, which include the use of a product called Crowd IQ to take high resolution pictures and use computer vision algorithms to analyze fan demographics, behavior and attention spans. They can even use this data to predict where fights are most likely to happen by merging the density of visiting fans and beer sales to send extra security to that section in advance. But what this really comes down to is making the team more money. And the way they're doing that is genius. For example, these cameras are tracking when fans are looking at the field, the jumbo Tron or even their phones. And based on this data, they know when the best time is to place an in stadium ad. But even more impressive is that based on This visual data, the Lions know the race, age, gender, and fan demographics of each section. So theoretically, they could place.

Like, we know they lay eggs, but we have never once found a reproductive organ on an eel. Nobody has ever found or seen a pregnant eel. And on top of all of that, they refuse to reproduce in captivity. Matter of fact, they will stunt their own growth, remain as juveniles only to ensure that they have zero ability of conceiving. What we do know is that regardless of the species of eel, they all go to the same location to reproduce. Rather it be an American eel or a European eel, they will all go to the same exact spot, the sargassum sea. All eels go to the Sargasso Sea to reproduce. Sometimes they'll even travel over 5,000 miles just to get there. As soon as an eel lays its eggs there, it sacrifices itself to predators. So we'll never be able to study the body of a pregnant mother eel. Scientists have gone as far as to capture eels in their breeding beds, only to discover they're not pregnant or with eggs. This has been a mystery for quite some time. The Egyptians thought that eels come from warm rains landing on special dirt, and the Greeks thought that eels just appear if the sun hits the water just right.

Nursing homes can be pretty uncomfortable places. And when people with memory loss feel disoriented or upset, they often have the urge to just go home, leaving the nursing home and then needing to be found by local authorities and be brought back to the care facility. So the German nursing home set up a fake bus stop outside of the nursing home where patients who had the desire to leave would go and sit at and wait for the bus to take them home. The nurses could then go out to the bus stop and talk to the disoriented person and tell them they had missed the bus or the bus was coming back later and invite them inside for a cup of coffee or tea. The program was so successful, many other dementia care facilities copied it and expanded on it. Dementia care facilities started installing bus stops in their gardens so that when a senior with dementia would tell a nurse they had to go home and cook dinner for a long dead husband, the nurse could say, oh, okay, the bus stop is right over there and the bus will be there shortly to take you home. The senior would then go sit at the bus stop and wait for the bus, often forgetting why they were there shortly after Sitting down and then returning back to the nursing home.

There's a 5 acre park inside the Pentagon and in the middle of that park there was a hot dog stand. From satellite images, this hot dog stand looks incredibly significant, as if the entire Pentagon was built to protect this one key tactical building. And as Soviet satellites and spies noted, at the same hour of the day most days, many of the top brass would gather at this location. What they were actually doing was having lunch or a mid afternoon snack. But the Soviets believed the hot dog stand was much more than just a place to get food. They believed the hot dog stand LED to a secret underground bunker where the most important and top secret military briefings were taking place under the Protection of the hot dog stand illusion. No source from Russia has ever confirmed this rumor, but the hot dog stand still earned the nickname Cafe Ground Zero. In 2006, the hot dog stand was shut down and replaced with an OPA paint.

He pitched the idea of wearing a wig to the office's showrunners, but Greg Daniels refused, saying he would know if John was wearing a wig. But rather than turn down the role, John went to the Office's hair stylist Kim Fairy for help. In secret, Kim had a Jim Halpert wig made for John, and before filming one day they secretly put the wig on and went and film the scenes for the day. After filming, John left the wig on and drove to Greg Daniels office and once again pitched all the reasons why you should let him wear a wig for the remaining episodes of the season. But Greg Daniels kept saying no, I would know if you're wearing a wig. So John leant across the desk and said I don't think you would and remove the wig from his head.

He went outside to see his sheep backed into a corner surrounded by 11 coyotes and his guard dogs Casper and Daisy standing between them. Casper charged at the coyotes and it's believed he did so to get their attention off Daisy, who is pregnant with eight puppies. In a battle that lasted 30 minutes, Casper killed a number of the coyotes and when the coyotes realised they were losing they retreated into the woods. But Casper wasn't done and the 85 pound Great Pyrenees jumped a 4 foot fence and pursued the coyotes, catching and killing a few more. Then Casper disappeared into the woods. All told, he killed eight coyotes in the initial attack. Casper then went missing for two days and it was believed he was dead. But when neighbours started finding dead coyotes, they realised Casper was hunting down the three coyotes who had gotten away on the first night. Casper finally returned home bloody and beaten, missing his tail and a part of his ear. John took Casper to the vet and the Lifeline Animal Project helped him raise the $15,000 required to save Casper's life and after multiple surgeries Casper returned to the farm and is now an inside dog.

The city the Buccaneers play in is called Tampa, Florida, but there's no city called Tampa Bay. So why do professional teams do this, name themselves after places that don't actually exist on a map? Or better yet, why do most teams name themselves after cities, but a select group of teams have decided that they get to claim entire regions? Well, let's start with an easy example. You see, Tampa Bay is referring to a region of Florida around Tampa that includes a number of other cities. Likely worried that Tampa itself wasn't large enough to support an NFL team, the franchise put in a bid that included the surrounding metro areas to bolster its case for an expansion team. And besides, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is a way better name than the Quad City Pirates. what you'll find is that most teams with the names of entire states or regions instead of just cities usually choose this path for three reasons. First, they're worried the city they're located in isn't big enough to get an expansion franchise, so they named themselves after an entire state, make their fan base seem larger. This was the case for teams like the Carolina Panthers and Hurricanes. Second is that they don't want to alienate a city near where they play, like in the case of the Texas Rangers and Los Angeles Angels. And third, because of marketing. A really interesting example of this playing out. Is with Minnesota's professional sports teams, you see.

He transferred two hundred dollars from his credit account to his savings account. The ATM said transaction canceled, but the machine spit out two hundred dollars. Exploiting this glitch, Dan withdrew 13 dollars that night. Waking up sober, Dan called the bank to check his account balances. They were unchanged. Through trial and error, Dan figured out that this specific ATM would go offline between 1 and 3:00am and he could withdraw money he didn't have. Over the next five months, Dan withdrew $1.6 million. He quit his job through huge parties, rented private jets, luxurious hotel rooms, ate at the best restaurants and paid off a few friends tuition. Overcome with guilt, Dan called the bank in June 2,011 and admitted what he had done. The bank said the police would contact him. They never did. So he called the bank back a month later and again, they said the police would be in touch, but they never called. Dan went to the media to admit what he had done, doing an interview on national television and three print interviews, but still the police didn't call. Finally, three years later, Dan was arrested and pleaded guilty to 111 counts of fraud and theft. He spent one year in jail and when he was released in May 2016, he went back to working as a bartender.

Like normally we name things after the person who discovered them to honor their work and their legacy, you know, like Gaus's Law, Oiler's identity, Bernoulli's principle. But when a Muslim does it, El Kashy's Theorem, no, we're gonna call that one the Binomial Theorem or El Kashy's Law. No, actually that's the law of cosines. The most frustrating one to me has to be the quadratic formula because it's so important in mathematics and it's so ubiquitous. Like every high school has heard about the quadratic formula and it involves two of the most brilliant minds in all of the history of mathematics, Brahmagupta and eliphasis, and we called it the quadratic formula. Why? The worst though is the stolen credit, like Snell's Law, not discovered by Snell, discovered by Ibensah 600 years earlier. The Fibonacci sequence, not Fibonacci, known in India for hundreds of years. Pascal's triangle, not discovered by Pascal, known by the Persians and before them the Chinese. Even the Pythagorean Theorem, not discovered by Pythagoras, known in Babylon, ancient Egypt, ancient India. It just feels like a missed opportunity to teach people about how many different cultures contributed to our understanding of the world.

It's about preserving morality in a traditional biblical world view. Conservative Christians were pro slavery, and then you changed your mind. Conservative Christians were against women suffrage, and then you changed your mind. Conservative Christians were pro segregation, and then you changed your mind. Mostly.

So Michael Jordan, that year that he was chasing the Defensive Player of the year award on the road when there was seemingly a neutral scorekeeper, he averaged three steals and blocks a game, or per 36 minutes stocks. But at home, those numbers jumped to five and a/2. Now, was he just better at home than on the road? Tom Haberstro got full game footage. How about this?

But thankfully that twisted ankle didn't seem to bother him at all considering this man was pop popping off scoring 43 points in a game that went to double overtime. But it wasn't just Paulo scoring for the magic with the entire team shooting an insane 25 for 44 from three. The Sacramento Kings on the other hand were struggling like the Aaron Foxx who ended the game with only 15 points. But thankfully they have Malik, Sixth Man of the Year monk on their team coming off the bench to drop. Thirty Seven Points and nine assists was the only reason why the Sacramento Kings ended up winning this game. But it wouldn't be a real NBA game if there weren't some terrible calls from the officials then failing to call this illegal screen on sub bonus and calling this play a charging foul. But by far the worst call that almost LED to the Kings losing this game was this right here. They said this was last touch by the Sacramento Kings, which my reaction when seeing this was just like what?

So sometimes I miss my old job at the mall. Cause working at a store in the mall means you know everybody's business. You know that the van store employees always hook up with the packs on employees. But it also means you have access to insider knowledge. Something my sweet Colombian mother would call chisme. For example, the Auntie Anne's pretzel stand, they don't just sell pretzels. You have to go up to them, ask for Aunt Gloria, and then they'll show you a wide selection of alternative products, if you know what I mean. The point is working at the mall is you hear a lot of tea and you meet a lot of characters. But by far my favorite character was our slutty mall Santa Claus. Like most malls in America, we had a mall Santa Claus. The same guy would come back every year. But after one year, our old guy retired and they replaced him with this new guy who was hot. Like, you could tell he was hot underneath all of his Santa makeup. That's how hot he was. Not only was he smoking hot, he was also sensitive. I know because I worked right across from the mall Santa Claus setup. So you would get all these suburban moms going to take their kids to meet Santa Claus. But really, they were the ones.

How can we afford an 80 thousand dollar house? Very simple. Over 30 years, just a trifle down payment and a pittance of a mortgage. And two live being parents with the pan who can sign. So that clip was from Boy Meets World. And that episode aired in 1999. And I couldn't help myself, so I had to run the numbers. The show took place in Philly and I saw that the median house price was around $80,000 in 1999. Now according to Pango, were high school students without a job, so they couldn't qualify. But what about the median household income back then? It's forty thousand dollars, which is about thirty three hundred dollars a month. And a three percent down payment on the median house was only twenty four hundred dollars. So somebody in Philly in 1999 didn't even have to save one month's income to put a down payment on this house. And the interest rates were around 7%, just like they are today. So with principal interest, property taxes, insurance and private mortgage insurance, the total payment was 7 hundred and fifty dollars a month to get the median house in Philly. And you're making 30 three hundred. So that's about what, 25%? So a family make

Children aren't allowed on the app. Funny, that's not what Mark told me. And how do you stop the children from using your app? We use age gating like the rest of the industry. And then when we find that they have gotten around that, we ban them. Oh, so you're saying children do lie and find their way on your app? What are you gonna do about that? We banned them. Don't you think these children shouldn't be spending an hour a day on your app? I think that's actually a conversation that needs to be had with the parents of the children. Don't interrupt me. I'm reclaiming my time. So, can you use the word China on your app? Can you say China? Yes. You could go right now and look up any of the things about China and find them. Does it access my Wi-Fi? What? Does the app. Does the app access my Wi-Fi? If it's connected to your Wi-Fi, yes. So what you're saying is that your app lies about China to children on our Wi-Fi? No, I didn't. Don't.

In the past. It used to be that a loss would drop you a lot of spots and it would be tough to come back from. This year, it doesn't seem like the case so much. Good example of that is Oregon. I think if Oregon was undefeated right now, they would be the No. 2 team in the country, maybe the No. 1, but they'd probably be No. 2 just behind Georgia in these rankings. So if an undefeated Oregon team is No. 2 and an Oregon team in real life that lost to Stanford is No. 4, then losing to that unranked Stanford team only dropped them two spots. Now, that's not me hating on Oregon. If they went out, they deserve to be in. But you can't tell me that losing to an unranked team only dropping you two spots is normal. Or look at Alabama and Michigan State. Michigan State is an undefeated Power 5 team with the top 10 win and they're still not ranked over a one loss, Alabama. Now, the reason why I think they're doing this is because the two teams that they don't wanna let in are Wake Forest if they go undefeated and Cincinnati if they go undefeated. The committee doesn't really want either of those teams to be in the.

Cause I thought Kadarius Tony was gonna be a superstar. Especially when he had that one game in his rookie season where he put up 200 yards against the Cowboys. And even looking back at it now, his movement skills playing receiver were just different. Cause who in their right mind even attempts a juke move like this? And unfortunately for Tony, his main concerns were always off the field issues. Not being able to stay healthy and catching the damn football. Cause if you look back at his most recent season in Kansas City, it was a mess. And it felt like every single interception that Patrick Mahomes threw was his fault. And you have to think any confidence he might have had left at this point is already in the gutter. Cause now Kadarius is a free agent and who knows if any team is willing to take a chance on him. Cause while I do think he has a lot of talent in which he's already displayed in the NFL, I think he also has way too much baggage to go along with that. To whoever made this graphic, by the way, you're a complete savage. Three years $9 per hour? Damn.

And this guy really fucking put DeMar Hamlin. And for context as to what AB is referring to, obviously, we all know that DeMar Hamlin almost died on the field against the Bengals. So of course, there's a insane conspiracy theory that went around that I obviously do not believe that DeMar Hamlin actually died that day and the guy representing him now is like a clone or something. So DeMar answered Antonio Brown back by saying, I pray god don't ever let me turn into a burnt old head like you. I used to look up to you damn near shit sad. For real, talk about a clone, bring back the real AB. Hamlin even exposed brown by showing how he never answers his DMS, calling him a weirdo and putting the hashtag pray for AB with a clown emoji. And I'm sure we could all agree that if you guys have kept up with Antonio Brown's Twitter account, sure, it could be for entertainment, but the guy is still off the rails. And Antonio answered back by basically saying that his therapist told him that NFL players have low self esteem and that they're weak. And I get that Antonio Brown is probably doing This for clicks and views. But I think we can again all agree that this shit is pretty low.

So whenever a Spanish speaking customer would walk into the store, my manager would automatically be like, Alejandro, your family is here. And he would make me go talk to them. I know it sounds messed up, but the idea was I speak Spanish, I can help these people better. The thing is, I never spoke Spanish to these people. And don't get me wrong, I tried to speak Spanish to them at first, but they would just shoot me away like I was another annoying salesman or like I was a white boy trying to beat his high score on Duolingo. So instead, I came up with a different strategy. Spanish speaking customers would walk in, they would talk amongst themselves about what they're interested in in Spanish. And I would act like I didn't understand them. But I would ease drop. I would listen to every word they say and then I would slowly start bringing out all the items they mentioned to their friend. If they pick up a pair of red vans and say in Spanish, I would bring it out and be like, hey, um, we have these shoes. We just got these in. They look like your style. I'd open them and it'd be the exact shoes they were talking about in Spanish.

I want you to guess right now. Comment what you think the song is. I'll wait. Did you guess? Well, you're wrong. The song is Life Is a highway by Rascal Flats from the car soundtrack. No brownies for you. And this doesn't happen like an hour or 30 minutes.

Their mechanics just look so off. It's like no one taught them how to throw the ball properly. But the second I flip the video and make Tua a right handed thrower, he automatically looks like an all pro quarterback. Like, am I tripping? I think it's just funny because he looks so much better throwing the ball right handed. We're just not used to these lefties in the league. I'm not gonna lie though, the one guy who had an elite lefty release was Michael Vic. This guy would just fling the ball 60 yards and it looked beautiful. Even Michael Pennell Jr, the 2024 prospect from Washington, has such a awkward and weird release as a lefty. Like these throws just look so awkward to me. Has a weird hitch. And yeah, he is throwing lasers. But the second that I flip the video and make this guy a righty, he automatically looks so much better. As it is, throughout NFL history, there's only been 33 left handed quarterbacks. And just for reference, in the entire Super Bowl era, there's been 721 total quarterbacks.

Y'all just refuse to listen. Every team that plays the Pacers gets surprised to get their ass whooped by the Pacers. They're never ready for. Why do you think Boston had nightmares about a team they swept? Cause if you play the Pacers, you have to play your ass off for 48 minutes. There is no rest. There is no chilling. Defensively now they're decent. They are terrifying. That's what the cats found out yesterday. These motherfuckers go. Thing is about the Pacers that really makes them fucking ridiculous is that you could blink and they have scored 20 points in a fucking row. You legitimately could be playing so well and then out of nowhere they start whooping your ass. This is why they're such a terrifying team to play, which is why I said on a video that barely got any views that they are the last team I wanna play in the east this year. Because to me, there's a game plan that can work for Cleveland. There's a game plan that can work for the Celtics. You just have to.

And let's just say his Wikipedia page only shows his G League stats. Rick Barry, Hall of Famer and NBA champion, known for his signature granny free throw. He had three sons playing the NBA, John, Brent and drew. And let's just say if you combine all three of their career NBA points, it's still less than half of their dad, Gary Peyton, the glove, maybe the best defensive point guard of all time. His son, Gary Peyton the second, maybe should be called the mitten as he somehow managed to play for seven G League teams in five years. Bill Walton, the legendary eccentric center who won an MVP and the title. His son Luke Walton, known best for sitting on the bench when Kobe won two titles. He also got fired by LeBron James as head coach of the Lakers.

So in Florida, there was a home for $320,000 in 2020. That same home is selling for $550,000 today. But let's break that down. If you were to buy the house in 2020, if you did a two and a/2 percent interest rate on a 320,000 dollar home, your payment would only be 20 two hundred dollars a month and you would need to make 80,000 dollars a year to qualify for that loan with no debt. Now fast forward to today. If you bought it in 2023 for $550,000, it's a 7% interest rate, which your payment is now $3,800, where you would need to make $130,000 a year with no debts to afford that house. This just happened over the past three years. This is not talking about the 1980s. This is just the past three years. But here's where it gets like, ugh. If you kept that 30 thousand dollar loan, if you bought it in 2020, you would end up spending 146 thousand dollars over 30 years on interest.

Basic grocery purchases by Kevin Mcallister in the 1990 film Home Alone went from 19 dollars and 83 cents. Today, the same experiment ran a Bill over 72 dollars at one Chicago grocery store. The leap from 2022 to today, it's wild. But let's look at purchasing power. In 1990, these groceries were $19 and the median household income was $40,000. Fast forward to 2022, the groceries basically doubled to $44, and the income doubled as well. That all makes sense. But in the past year, it went from $44 to 72, which is a 1.6 increase. But yet the income stayed exactly the same. If the income would be keeping up, the income should be $129,000 for the median household income. And what do you know? That is the amount of money that the average American family needs to have a shot at qualifying at the average house. So all this inflation, housing prices, daycare, student loans, consumer debt is all on the rise, and yet income is stagnant. That is a big problem that we need to fix.

Cause it's something that happens way too often in game. You would think these coaches made sure it never happened again. And trust me, I understand that most of the time these players are just show boating and they probably black out while this happens. You would think before scoring a touchdown, the last thing you wanna do is accidentally drop the football. Cause I know for a fact that if it were me, I wouldn't let go of that shit until way after the play was over. The funny part is that sometimes it's not even controversial cause that was literally three yards before scoring. And even sometimes a few of these plays have even LED to teams losing games because of it. And it's honestly not as rare of a play as you might think cause over the last 10 to 15 years, it's happened on almost 40 different occasions. You would assume players would just stop doing it, especially if you cost your team points and your coach most likely benches you. Something I've also realized is it happens way more often in college football. So it's probably just a discipline thing. But why or how it started is still a mystery to me it's one of those plays that you could literally lose your job over.

And something I want you guys to keep in mind is this photo was only from 6 years ago. Let's just start with the obvious. We have Lamar Jackson, Calvin Ridley, Baker Mayfield and Saquon Barkley. These are guys we all know and are still in the NFL. We also got Georgia legend Sony Michelle, Ronald Jones, carry on Johnson from Detroit, who is a bust. And so is James Washington from Pittsburgh. We got young Nick Chub, another Georgia legend. We have Darius Geis from LSU. What the fuck happened to that guy? And someone tell me who the hell No. 12 is. We have Mason Rudolph, pre Miles Garrett, helmet smash. And look at young Josh Allen and Sam Donald. If only you knew what the Jets were gonna do to you. And the craziest part about all this is half these guys aren't even in the NFL anymore, like Bears 2nd round pick Anthony Miller. We got Kaylen Bilge in the Dolphins uniform. We got Michael Gallup and Rashard Penny next to him. We do have two stud wide receivers and Christian Kirk and DJ Moore. Man, look at Josh Rosen. I wonder if he proved everyone wrong. And Ravens tight end Hayden Hearst. I Know you lied about your age. You look 43 in this picture. I will tell you guys one thing, the shelf life in the NFL is fucking rough.

And then he said, you can't do that. They asked Marcus Smart if it was some kind of inside joke. He's like, I don't know why he did that last year in the playoffs. He said the Celtics mindset is win or die. He went on the court one time to try and block a shot after it was a dead ball. Charles Barkley said if he did that to me, I would have knocked the hell out of him. Mazula responded to this. He said, I'm always up to get knocked out. I think that's important, too. If you can't go through the day hoping you don't get knocked out, I don't know what you do. Probably the most well known trait of Joe Mezuzas is that he's obsessed with the town, the movie the town. He said he watches it 4 times a week. Apparently this is pretty difficult to do cause this guy was like, I Tried.

I was 7 when my dad suddenly banned sleepovers at my best friend Katie's house. It made zero sense. We've been best friends since kindergarten and her family seemed perfect. Her dad was even our church's youth pastor. At first I thought he was just being mean. But then I noticed something weird. Every time Katie's dad came to our house, my dad would follow him around like a shadow. He'd even stand in the hallway when Katie's dad used our bathroom. Strangest part, my dad started reorganizing my room every single week. He checked behind my dresser, under my bed, even inside my favorite teddy bear. When I asked why, he just say dust bunnies are sneaky. Sometimes I catch him just standing in my doorway at night staring at my walls with this worried look. Things got even weirder when Katie's dad offered to help remodel my bedroom for free. My dad flat out refused, which made Katie's mom call us ungrateful. After that, whenever Katie's family invited me over, my dad would make up these ridiculous excuses. My goldfish was lonely, the weather was too nice, or my room needed cleaning again. I lost Katie as a friend that year. She told everyone at school my dad was crazy and controlling. I started believing it, too, especially when he installed new locks on my windows to keep the draft out in the middle of summer. Yesterday, while cleaning the attic, I found an old newspaper. The headline froze me in place. Local father arrested. Hidden cameras found in daughter's room. There was Katie's dad's photo. And suddenly, every strange thing my dad ever did made perfect sense. You see, Katie's dad always insisted on fixing things in my room during playdates. The last time he visited, my dad caught him hiding a tiny camera behind my dollhouse.

Our school had this absurd policy where every missed class dropped your grade by 3% unless you had a university sanctioned excuse. Most students just fake doctor's notes, but that seemed too risky. One bad forgery and you're facing academic dishonesty charges. I was desperate for a better solution. Professor Devereaux's 8:00am economics lectures were unbearable and Professor Cabour took attendance like it was a military roll call. Missing even one class could tank your final grade. During a particularly boring lecture about trade policy, I started reading through the student handbook instead, taking notes. On page 43, buried in section 4.2 of the attendance policy, I found it. Participation in university sponsored organizations and events shall be considered excused absences with proper documentation from the organization leader. That night I created the University Strategic Chess Association with my roommate Theo. We registered it through the Student Activities Portal, which automatically approved any club with fewer than 10 members without staff review or faculty advisor. Took about 15 minutes total. Theo became president and I was vice president and tournament coordinator. We created official letterhead with the university logo, made tournament schedules, and even designed certificates of participation. The first test came when I wanted to skip capers Friday morning class. I submitted an official.

Mom thought it was harmless, just kids building stuff online. But then Emma started acting weird. She'd whisper into her headset. When she thought no one was listening, she'd quickly close her laptop. Whenever I walked into her room one night, I heard her giggling. At 2:00am, I crept to her door and pressed my ear against it. She was talking to someone, saying things like, I can't wait to meet you, and my parents will never know. My stomach dropped. I waited until she fell asleep, then snuck into her room. I tried opening her laptop, but it was password protected. I tried her birthday, our dog's name. Nothing worked. The next morning, I confronted her at breakfast, asked who she was talking to last night. She choked on her cereal. Said it was just her friend from the game. Girl named Sarah who lived in the next town over. But her hands were shaking. She wouldn't look me in the eyes. I followed her to school that day, watched her texting someone during lunch break. She was smiling at her phone in a way that made my skin crawl. Like she had a secret. After school, I cornered her in our driveway, demanded to see her phone. She clutched it to her chest, started backing toward the house. Give me the Phone Emma! She ran and

I'm going to jump. My eight year old Emma was third in line to perform. She'd practiced Chopin's Minute Waltz for six months straight, her little fingers flying across the keys every night after homework. Tonight was the regional competition. First place meant a scholarship to the prestigious music academy she'd been dreaming about. Jake was sobbing. The custody hearing, losing Emma. I have nothing left.

Emma was adjusting her white dress backstage, probably running through the fingering one last time like she always did. Jake, please step back from the edge, I whispered, slipping out of the auditorium into the empty hallway. I can't live without her, Sarah. She's everything.

His favorite blue Dinosaur shirt was soaked and there was milk dripping from his hair. Angela was standing over him, face red with anger, while Donna was trying to comfort him.

When I told them about the cancer, they gave me thoughts and prayers responses, but immediately started talking about weekend plans and who was dating who.

By high school, I could hear a song once and play it back almost perfectly. Not from sheet music, just by listening. First day of music class, Mister Reynolds asked if anyone could play. I raised my hand, sat at the piano, and played a cold play song I'd Learned that week. When I finished, instead of being impressed, he frowned. Where's your sheet music? I don't use any. I play by ear. His face turned sour. That's. It's not how music works. Anyone can bang keys randomly. Real musicians read notes. I tried explaining I wasn't random. I knew chord progressions and music theory from YouTube. Cut me off. In my class, we follow proper technique. If you can't read music, you can't play. For weeks he'd force me to struggle through beginner sheet music while ignoring that I could already play advanced songs by ear. He'd Mark me down for improper fingering, even though the music sounded perfect. The worst part was during practice sessions.

When my fiance broke up with me, I had been with my fiance Alex for four years. We met at a friend's party back in 2020 and just clicked. We moved in together a year later and things were good until they weren't. Alex finished his PhD in economics last year. I have a Masters in Media Science and decided not to pursue a doctorate. I started working right after graduation and over time started earning more than him. That didn't seem like a problem to me. He was chasing his goal and I was doing well. I believed we were building a life together. I was happy to support him while he finished his studies. I never rubbed it in his face or made it about control. But something changed over the last few months. It started with small things. he said we needed to repaint the apartment from dark green to white. I asked why. He snapped, forget it, and never brought it up again. Another time, I was lying on the couch with cramps, blanket over my head, Netflix on, house spotless, and he came in furious that I was just sitting there all day. I tried to talk to him and again, he shut me down. It's not a big deal. That was the pattern. He'd act pissed. I'd ask what was wrong and he'd insist he was fine, but he clearly wasn't. He started nitpicking everything. The apartment, the couch, me. I could feel his resentment building.

In my family, it was the yearly Penance Day. It started with my great grandfather, a deeply religious man who believed in public confession of sins. Every December 29th, the entire extended family would gather in my grandparents living room for what can only be described as emotional torture. I was 12, the first time I was deemed old enough to participate. Before then, I'd been sent upstairs with the other kids, hearing only muffled crying and occasional shouts from below. James, it's your turn this year, my father said that morning, his eyes not quite meeting mine. It's part of becoming a man in this family. I remember the pit in my stomach as we drove to Grandpa's house. What exactly do I have to do, I asked. Dad's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. Let's be honest, that's all they want. They, the elders, your grandfather, your uncles and me. When we arrived, the house already felt heavy. The adults sat in a circle of chairs in the living room while the younger kids were herded upstairs by my aunt. The Christmas decorations still hung, making.

In my house growing up, nobody under 16 could lock their bedroom door, ever. Didn't matter if you were changing clothes, crying your eyes out, or just wanted to be alone. If you were under 16, your door stayed unlocked. Even the bathroom had this weird sliding thing my dad could open with a quarter. I thought it was the dumbest rule ever. My sister Emma got her lock the day she turned 16 and literally rubbed it in my face. Every chance she got, he'd slam her door and yell through it, guess what? I'm locked in! Like it was some huge victory. My dad always said the same thing when I complained. Locks are for people who can handle responsibility. You'll understand when you're older. Which just made me matter, because that's what adults say when they can't give you a real answer. Everyone at school thought my parents were control freaks. When I told my friend Jake about it, he was like, dude, that's insane. What if you're changing? I just shrug and say, I change really fast. But the truth is, I was embarrassed. I felt like my parents didn't trust me, like they thought I was some little kid who couldn't be left alone for five minutes without doing something stupid. The worst part was when I had friends over, they'd go to use the bathroom and come back looking confused. Uh, The door doesn't lock. I'd have to explain the rule and watch them give me that look. You know the one the. Your parents are weird.

He'd walk into first period doing this perfect impression of Mister Watson trying to reach the top shelf in the supply closet, complete with the little grunting sounds. The whole class would lose it. During lunch, Leo would tell these crazy stories about his weekend adventures, like the time he supposedly convinced a McDonald's worker he was conducting a French fry quality inspection and got free food for an hour. Even the quiet kids would crack up. Teachers couldn't stay mad at him when he got caught putting googly eyes on every calculator in math class. Missus Chang just sighed and handed him a detention slip while trying not to smile. But here's the thing, nobody noticed. Leo never talked about home, ever. One Tuesday, we got this substitute teacher who clearly didn't know our class. She gave us this writing assignment. What do you wish people knew about you? Everyone groaned and wrote generic stuff about wanting to be famous or whatever. But Leo actually seemed focused. He was writing for like 20 minutes straight, which was weird because he usually just drew little cartoons in the margins. Then the sub did something that still makes my stomach drop. She started reading papers out loud, thinking they were all anonymous, most were boring. Then she picked up Leo.

My college roommate thought he could cheat his way through our final creative writing assignment by stealing a story from some obscure author. But he picked the worst possible person to plagiarize from. had been coasting through Professor Williams's creative writing class all semester while I actually worked on my stories. He'd submit these half hearted pieces at the last minute and somehow still pass with C. Is the final assignment was worth 50% of our grade. Write a 10 page original short story. We had six weeks to complete it. I spent countless hours crafting mine, going through multiple drafts, and getting feedback from the writing center. Matt? Predictably, I waited until the night before it was due. I found him frantically searching online for something to copy. There's gotta be some story I can steal that the professor won't recognize, he muttered, scrolling through random websites. Matt, just write something. Anything original is better than plagiarizing. Dude, I don't have time. Besides, Williams is like 60 years old. She probably doesn't even know how to use Google. Around 2 a m, I found what he was looking for. Perfect. This story called The Last Train Home by some author named E M. Williams. It's exactly 10 pages, and it's beautiful. No way our professor has read this. I glanced at his screen. The story was indeed well written. Published on what looked like a small literary magazine. Website. Matt, that seems risky. Relax. It's from 1987, Professor

We were at my parents house for dinner and the whole table got awkward. My mom even pulled up a baby name website on her phone and started reading better options out loud. I was furious, but tried to keep it civil since my husband's parents had flown in from California to meet my family for the first time. Two weeks later, my dad had a minor heart attack.

Three different hospital staff asked him to spell it, and one even joked that you wished your parents gave you an easier name, huh? My dad looked at my husband and me and just. I get it now.

I worked at a fancy restaurant where celebrities and rich people came to show off. This one kid, maybe 16, would come in every weekend with his friends and treat the staff like garbage. He'd snap his fingers, throw food on the floor and laugh when I had to clean it up. His dad owned the restaurant, so we all just took it. I needed the job too badly to say anything. One Friday night, he spit. He spilled his drink on purpose, looked me dead in the eyes and said, that's what you're paid for, right? His friends all laughed. I was about to clean it when his dad appeared out of nowhere. I'd never seen such rage in someone's eyes. He grabbed his son by the collar and marched him to the back office. Ten minutes later, the kid emerged wearing our uniform and an apron. His dad announced to the entire restaurant, my son will be working here every weekend for the next three months. Anyone who tips him is fired. That first night, he cried when he had to unclog toilets. By week 3, he was silent but working. By month 2, I caught him apologizing to another server when a customer was rude to them. On his last day, he handed me an envelope with a handwritten letter inside. It just said, I never saw you before. Now I do. His dad didn't punish Him. He showed him what the world is actually like for most people. Sometimes the best gift you can give a kid is taking away their bubble.

My upstairs neighbour, Jake, moved in six months ago and immediately turned my life into hell. This guy would blast music until 3:00am, have loud parties on weeknights and somehow managed to make every footstep sound like he was dropping bowling balls. I tried the polite approach first, knocked on his door, introduced myself, explained I work early shifts and asked if he could keep it down after ten PM, Jake looked me up and down with this smirk. Hey, man, I pay rent here too. If you don't like noise, maybe you should move to the suburbs. Noise got worse after that conversation. It was like he took my request as a personal challenge. He turned his music up louder, stomp around deliberately and even started doing what sounded like furniture rearranging at midnight. I complained to building management three times. They said they'd look into it, but nothing changed. Jake knew exactly how to game the system. Just quiet enough during business hours to avoid official complaints. After two months of sleep deprivation, I decided to fight back strategically. I work in audio engineering, so I know a lot about sound systems and acoustics. I also had access to professional equipment through my job. First, I researched Jake's schedule. He worked late shifts at a restaurant, usually getting home around 2:00am and sleeping until noon. Perfect. I set up a high powered subwoofer aimed directly at his bedroom floor. And programmed it to play specific frequencies that would travel through the building structure, not music, just targeted sound waves designed to be maximally annoying. Every morning at exactly 7 a. M, right when Jake would be in his deepest sleep, I'd activate my system, 15 minutes of perfectly timed base frequencies that would rattle his walls.

Every few minutes, I'd nod seriously and say things like, okay, uploading your medical history now or processing your remaining time. I mean remaining coverage data. Pure gibberish. I was literally just clicking around Google. But she was convinced I was performing digital miracles, kept whispering prayers and crossing herself whenever I hit the keyboard, probably thinking if the computer was going to steal anyone's soul today, better it be mine than hers.

At first I felt terrible, but then my friend Meg mentioned that Stewie had borrowed $500 for medical school applications. Another friend had lent him money for lab equipment. This wasn't just lying.

This happened during my senior year. I was in AP Physics with this teacher who had zero tolerance for bullies. There was this kid, Chandler, who thought he was hot stuff because his dad owned car dealerships. Chandler like to brag about his dating life, especially in front of this quiet genius, Rachel, who never spoke up. One day we're doing presentations on momentum and energy. Rachel's explaining collision physics. She's nervous but clearly knows her stuff. Chandler starts yawning loudly and age whispering, someone put me out of my misery. And when does the smart girl stop talking? Rachel stumbles, turns red, her confidence cracking, but she keeps going. The whole class gets uncomfortable waiting to see what happens next. The teacher stands up, walks over and says, Chandler, I have a question about your understanding. Chandler gets this smug look and goes, sure, shoot. The teacher says, if your brain was a car from your dad's lot, would it be certified pre owned or still under warranty for original defects? The entire class went dead silent, then exploded with laughter. Even Chandler's buddies were trying not to laugh because Rachel just explained that clearly has more length and depth than anything you've ever shown a girl. Chandler tried complaining about teacher insults, but the teacher smiled. I wasn't insulting you, Chandler, just using an analogy I thought you'd understand. Rachel, continue your excellent presentation. Rachel crushed it. Chandler stayed. Quiet the rest of the semester and that teacher became legendary. Best classroom roast I've ever witnessed.

I pull up to the drive through speaker and this voice comes through. Sound like it's been filtered through three layers of defeat and a broken dreams machine. What you want? Not welcome to McDonald's or how can I help you? Just pure for existential exhaustion in four words. So I respond the way my mom raised me. Good evening. Could I please get a Big Mac meal with a Coke? Thank you so much. Silence. Dead silence like I just spoke ancient Latin. What? A Big Mac meal please with a Coke. Thank you. More silence. Then why are you talking like that? I blink like what? All fancy and stuff. You making fun of me? No, I'm just ordering food. Nobody talks that polite at 2:00am. You being sarcastic, ma'am? I said please and thank you. That's not sarcasm. That's basic human decency. But she's not having it. Hold on. I sit there for five minutes wondering if being raised with manners is now considered a hate crime. She comes back. My manager wants to talk to you. A new voice appears, male, tired, sounds like he's been managing teenagers since the Clinton administration. Sir, my employee says you're being Disrespectful. I said please and thank you. Right. But the way you said it was condescending. I'm getting accused of weaponizing politeness like I'm some kind of manners terrorist. I was just trying to be nice. I explained. See, that's the problem. Nobody's that nice at 2:00am unless they're up to something.

Mr. Johnson, we need to discuss your son's behavior in class today. My heart sank. Behavior issues? My straight A kid. When he got home, I cornered him in the kitchen. The counselor called. What happened? He shrugged. Missus Peterson overreacted. Didn't do anything wrong. I've raised this kid for fifteen years and know his lying face. This wasn't it. He seemed genuinely confused. The next morning, we walked into Mrs. Peterson's office. She didn't even say hello, just launched right in. Your son has been extremely disruptive with his inappropriate comments. I glanced at my son, who looked bewildered. What exactly did he say? She adjusted her glasses. Yesterday I was teaching about climate change and said it's the most pressing issue for their generation. Your son raised his hand and said, no, it's pressing the skip button fast enough on YouTube ads. I bit my lip so hard I tasted blood. She continued, when I told him this was serious, he said, so is my battery life, but we all have priorities. Couldn't hold back anymore. I looked at Missus Peterson and said, you called me in because my son made some nice jokes. She blinked. These are serious issues. I stood up and grabbed my son's backpack. The only serious issue is you wasting my morning because my son Got your whole class laughing. As we walked to the car, I finally broke down laughing. Those were my jokes, I admitted. He just smirked. Yeah, but I delivered them better.

I was at Thanksgiving dinner and my uncle, a high powered corporate lawyer, he caught me by the pie table still playing with crayons. He smirked, nodding at my graphic design work. He then announced to my nearby parents, my bonus this year will be more than he'll make in the next decade. He put on that fake concerned face look. I'm just saying, he said loud enough for everyone to hear. Passions cute, but it doesn't pay bills. When's the grown up job coming? I took a bite of my pie, paused for a moment and looked him right in the eye. Thanks for the advice, Uncle Diddy, I said, my voice perfectly calm. You know, I was talking to dad the other day about that big corporate merger you closed last year, the one that got you that huge bonus. Puffed out his chest, beaming. That's right, a lot of hard work. I nodded slowly. Yeah. He told me about the 300 people who were laid off a week before Christmas because of it. The air in the room went still. My aunt froze with her wine glass halfway to her lips. The smug look on my uncle's face began to twitch. He was doing the math in his head, desperately searching for an escape route but found none. He glanced at my dad, a flicker of real panic in his eyes. He had spent a lifetime holding court. But now the jury was staring right at him. The entire family was watching us, waiting. I took one last slow bite of pie, looked him dead in the eye and gave him a small, polite smile. You're right, my passion doesn't pay like yours, but at least no one loses their home because of it.

Charlie's doing his usual routine of sniffing every blade of grass like he's conducting a scientific survey. That's when she appears, this woman, power walking toward us in full athletic gear, moisture wicking everything, fitness tracker, blinking like a Christmas tree. Let's call her Marathon mom. She stops right in front of us and goes, excuse me, you're walking him wrong. I blink, I'm sorry, what? She points at Charlie. Your technique. You're letting him lead. That's not how you establish dominance. Charlie, meanwhile, is completely unbothered, just sitting there panting like he's watching Netflix. He's been walked like this for five years. I say, we're doing fine. Marathon mom shakes her head, no, no, no. The leash should be tight. He should be at your left heel. You're basically letting him walk you. I look down at Charlie, who's now lying down because this conversation is apparently too boring for him. Ma'am, we're just going around the block. She pulls out her phone. I'm a certified dog trainer. I have 17,000 followers on Dog Tok. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. Dog Tok. We've officially entered a parallel universe. That's great, I say, but Charlie and I have our system worked out. She ignores me completely and starts approaching Charlie. Here. Let me show you. Charlie immediately gets up and hides behind my legs. He's never done this before. Even he knows something's off.

He says he's buying it for his son's birthday and needs it urgently. I can come today with cash, he messages. Just send me your address and I'll be right over. I suggest meeting at a public place like the mall, but Mike insists on coming to my house. I have a truck and wanna test the laptop properly before buying. Something feels off. Real buyers don't mind public meetings, and who needs a truck for a laptop? I agreed to the house meeting, but decide to do some detective work first. Mike's Facebook profile is only 3 weeks old with barely any posts or friends. His profile picture looks like a stock photo. I reverse search his profile image and find it on a website selling generic business headshots. Mike is definitely not his real name. Here's where I get creative. Instead of confronting him or canceling, I decide to set up a controlled environment to see what his real plan is. I move my laptop and all valuables out of the house. I set up security cameras in multiple rooms and have my neighbor watch.

Marcus was that classic middle school bully, 8th grade, 6 feet tall, sitting in the back, throwing things at younger kids. He'd steal lunch money, knock books out of hands and make kids give up their seats. Bus driver Missus Patterson was 70 and could barely hear what was happening behind her. Marcus knew this and always stopped whenever she glanced in the rearview mirror. Alex sat three seats ahead of me, always alone, always writing in this black notebook. He was small for sixth grade, wore thick glasses and seemed like an easy target. But Marcus never bothered him, which was weird. One Tuesday, Marcus started targeting Alex. He flicked paper balls at Alex's head for 10 minutes. Alex didn't react, just kept writing. Hey, nerd, Marcus shouted. You deaf or just stupid? Alex looked up, adjusted his glasses, wrote something down, then went back to his notebook. This made Marcus furious. For two weeks, Marcus escalated, stealing Alex's pencil, knocking his books down, calling him names. Alex would respond the same way, no anger, no tears, just careful observation and writing in that notebook. The breaking point came when Marcus grabbed Alex's notebook. What's so important in here? Loser. Alex didn't try to grab it back.

Fire me. I dare you. Moment from work. It was my breaking point. After eight years in emergency services. As senior paramedic, I covered countless shifts when others couldn't. Three Christmases, four Thanksgivings, my father's funeral. I was there for my community. Last summer, I requested two days. First in 14 months, my son's graduation. My supervisor denied it, claiming staffing shortages while approving vacation for the new hire, who was his brother in law. Day before graduation, we responded to a major accident. My supervisor radioed, Johnson, take the long transport. Others need to get off shift. That meant missing graduation. As I helped the victim, I saw his brother in law in his ambulance, scrolling TikTok, logging no patience. At the hospital, my supervisor gave a tour to county officials. We have the most dedicated team, he boasted. Johnson hasn't missed a day in 14 months. In bloody scrubs. I walked up to him. Because you denied every request. I'm missing my son's graduation while your brother in law watches TikTok during emergencies. Officials looked shocked. My supervisor's face reddened. My office now, he hissed. Handed him my badge. Fire me. No need. I quit. Three weeks later, four paramedics followed me to a neighboring county. Six months after our department failed to state audit, officials remembered our encounter and called me. Today, I run the department. First policy guaranteed family time off. And my old supervisor? He can apply for entry positions after remedial Training

The photo shows some wild eyed maniac with butchered hair. I need you to ruin my hair, he says, dead serious. Make it look like I cut it myself with a butter knife. Stewie's an actor auditioning for a psycho cult leader role. Against every professional instinct, I start hacking away, patchy here, uneven there, creating a disaster. As I'm cutting, Stewie starts getting into character, muttering about cosmic energy and the awakening. His eyes get this creepy, distant look. I finish the cut and hold up the mirror. Instead of thanking me, he stares at his reflection for 10 seconds in complete silence. Then he explodes. He jumps out of the chair, points at me, and screams betrayer! You've stolen my power! My other customers freeze like deer in headlights. This maniac drops to his knees, clutching his hair, wailing. My cosmic energy strained at all. He crawls on hands and knees toward the door, sobbing hysterically. He crawls right out onto the sidewalk, still screaming about his stolen vibrations. I'm standing there with Scissors, wondering if I just triggered a mental breakdown. My clients are staring at me like I'm some hair wizard who performed an exorcism. And an hour later, my phone buzzes payment plus a two hundred dollar tip. The message got the part Casting director said she'd never seen such raw commitment. Thanks for the energy. Sorry about the scene. The guy's method acting was so intense, even he forgot he was acting.

About two months ago, my 8 year old son Stewie came running up to me with this wild proposal. Dad, I'll eat vegetables for a whole month if you let me dye my hair purple. Now my wife had been fighting the vegetable war for years. This kid would rather starve than touch a carrot. But purple hair? That's where I drew the line. Absolutely not. Your mother would divorce me and take half my stuff in alimony. He wasn't giving up, though. What if I make it two months of vegetables? I almost laughed. This kid once cried because a pea rolled too close to his chicken nuggets, claiming it poisoned his entire meal. Then he hits me with the nuclear option. Fine, three months of vegetables and I'll do my homework without being asked. My ears perked up. No more nightly homework battles, no more tears over math problems. And you want purple hair for how long? Just until school picture day. That was six weeks away. I looked at this tiny negotiator and realized he basically offered me three months of peace for six weeks of judgment from other parents. The math was working in my favor, though. We shook on it. The next day I took him to get the most ridiculous purple Mohawk you've ever seen. He looked like a Hot Topic mannequin in toddler form. My wife nearly fainted when we walked through The door. What did you do? Cool. Picture day arrives and I'm expecting him to ask about going back to normal hair.

Stock tips daily with investment advice, Skate Life, showing tricks at the local park and even cooking with Thai, teaching basic recipes. Each account had a completely different personality, voice and audience. He'd been waking up at 5 a. M. To film content before school and staying up past midnight editing. The most shocking part, he was making actual money, over $700 last month from brand deals. When I confronted him, he broke down. I just wanted to be someone interesting dad at school. I'm just Tyler who never talks online. People actually listen to me. He'd been using a voice modulator and clever camera angles so no one would know his real age. We had a long talk about internet safety, but I couldn't bring myself to make him shut it all down. Instead, we compromised. I now monitor his accounts. He only posts age appropriate content and we're establishing boundaries. But sometimes I still wonder if I'm doing the right thing by letting him Continue his mini social media empire.

What do you think you're doing? James just pulled out his student handbook. You banned backpacks and bags, sir. There's nothing about filing cabinets. The next morning, half my class brought ridiculous substitutes. My friend Mark dragged in a plastic kiddie pool with his books floating inside. Sarah used her little brother's toy wagon. I brought my dad's tackle box. By Wednesday, the hallways were chaos. One kid carried everything in a microwave. Someone even brought a wheelbarrow filled with hay and nested their books in it. But on Thursday, everything went nuclear. This football player tried to one up everyone by bringing a shopping cart he borrowed from the grocery store. He was racing it down the main staircase when it tipped over and crashed into a trophy case. Glass everywhere. Nobody got hurt, but our principal's face while staring at the shopping cart in his trophy case, priceless. The next morning's announcement, after careful consideration, backpacks will be permitted again effective immediately. James never bragged, but I caught him smiling at his locker. Quiet kids started a revolution with A filing cabinet and didn't say a word.

I hired this contractor named Tony to remodel my kitchen. He came recommended by a neighbor and quoted me $8,000. Seemed reasonable, so I signed the contract and paid him $3,000 up front. Tony showed up the first day with his crew, tore out my old cabinets and countertops, then disappeared for three weeks. When I finally got him on the phone, he had a sob story about family emergencies. When he finally showed up two weeks later, Tony had a new story. We ran into unexpected issues. The electrical work is more complicated than we thought. We need another $4,000 to finish. I looked at my kitchen. It was exactly the same as when they'd left. Torn apart with no progress. What's electrical work? I asked. You haven't touched anything except demo. The wiring behind the walls isn't up to code. We have to bring everything up to current standards before installing new cabinets. This was complete BS. I had the electrical inspected six months earlier when I bought the house. Everything was perfectly up to code. Tony kept pushing. I've already invested a lot of time in this project. If you don't want to pay for additional work, I'll have to walk away. That's when I realized Tony was running a classic renovation scam. Take the money, do minimal work, then demand more cash or abandon the project. But Tony didn't know I'm a project Manager for a construction company. I know exactly how renovation projects work, what they cost, and what permits are required. Alright, Tony, I said calmly, before we discuss additional costs, can you show me the electrical work that needs to be updated? It's behind the walls. You can't see it until we open them up. But you haven't opened any walls. You've only done demolition on the cabinets. Tony started getting defensive. Look, I've been doing this for 15 years. I know what I'm talking about. Great.

Stock shelves, help customers find pens, pretend the customer is always right, even when they're asking if we sell computer papers for their iPhone. But I made one fatal mistake. I actually tried. While my co workers were perfecting the art of looking busy while doing absolutely nothing, I was reorganizing inventory, helping customers efficiently, and actually knowing where products were located. Rookie error. My manager, Dave, who looks like he peaked in high school and now manages his depression through energy drinks, start noticing that customers keep asking for me specifically where's that kid who actually knows where stuff is? Is the helpful guy working today. Can you get the employee who doesn't act like I'm bothering him? At first, Dave seems cool with it. Good work, keep. But then the comparison comments start why can't you be more like him? Customers ask my co workers he helped me in five minutes. Why did it take you 20? That other guy actually cared about helping me. That's when I noticed the energy shift. My co workers start giving me looks like I personally ruined their vibe. Sarah, who spends most of her shift taking selfies in the bathroom, starts getting passive aggressive. Some of us Don't need to try hard to feel important, she mutters while pretending to organize pens she's never touched. Tyler, whose main skill is disappearing whenever work needs to be done, starts making comments about people who make everyone else look bad. But the breaking point comes during our team meeting. Dave pulls up the customer feedback surveys on his laptop. So we got some interesting comments this month. He reads them out loud.

Mr Collins walked into our seventh grade classroom on the first day looking nervous as hell. He kept sweating and fumbling with his calculator for basic problems. When he tried to show us how to multiply fractions, he wrote 2, 3, 4, 5 = 6, 15 on the board. That's wrong. It should be 8, 15. I knew it, but I didn't want to embarrass him on day one. But then it got worse, way worse. During our first quiz, he gave us a word problem that said, if Jake has 12 apples and gives away 5, how many does he have left? Simple, right? 7 apples. But Mr Collins marked my answer wrong and wrote 17 as the correct answer. When I asked him about it, he said, well, he gave them away, so you add them together. I went home confused and asked my older sister, Rachel, who was in high school. She looked at the quiz and nearly spit out her drink laughing. Your teacher added instead of subtracted. That's insane. The next week, things got even more ridiculous. We were learning long division and Mr Collins couldn't figure out how to divide 144 by 12. He kept getting 14 as his answer instead of 12. Half the class was confused, but some kids started raising their hands to point out his mistakes. He'd get flustered and say stuff like there are multiple Ways to solve problems. No, there aren't. Math isn't like English where you can have different interpretations. Two plus two is four, not five. By October, I started bringing.

Not for illness, family emergencies, or even if you were literally dying. The policy was especially harsh in my calculus class, which met at 8 a m. Three times a week. I had a genetic condition that sometimes caused me to sleep for 16 to 20 hours straight. Episodes were random, and medication barely helped. My doctor wrote letters explaining my condition, but Professor Abbott just smiled coldly and said, rules are rules. Perhaps you should consider a different university. The thing is, I had a full scholarship that required maintaining a 3.5 GPA. Failing calculus meant losing everything I'd worked for. I couldn't let that happen. One sleepless night, powered by energy drinks and desperation, I went through every university policy document I could find in the Disability Services handbook. Buried in a footnote on page 47, I found something interesting. Students with documented medical conditions may utilize remote attendance options when such accommodations do not fundamentally alter course requirements. The next morning, I marched into the Disability Services office with my medical records. The coordinator, Nancy, was skeptical, but couldn't deny the policy existed. She reluctantly approved my accommodation request. Professor Abbott nearly burst.

Wouldn't even watch TV or hang out. If I tried to talk to him after 8, he'd literally put in earplugs and ignore me. The grocery orders were strange as well. Cases of weird drinks, protein powders with names I couldn't pronounce, and these little white pills that came in unmarked bottles. I started thinking maybe he would.

He was the best man at my wedding five years ago. The guy who helped me move into my first apartment and stayed up with me when my dad died. But people change. I first noticed something was wrong at their engagement party. Emma dropped a glass, and the look on her face. Here. She glanced at Zach like she was bracing for something. I brushed it off. Then came the cookout at my place last month. Emma was wearing a cardigan despite it being 85 degrees outside. When she reached for the ketchup, her sleeve pulled up. The bruises were dark purple. She caught me looking and quickly pulled her sleeve down. Laughed it off as being clumsy. That night, I couldn't sleep. I. I told my wife what I saw. She said, lots of people bruise easily. You've known Zach your whole life, she said. Do you really think he's capable of that? A week later, we met them for dinner. Emma excused herself to the bathroom, and my wife followed a few minutes later. When they came back, my wife's face was pale. You were right, she whispered. Emma's back is covered in bruises. She made me promise not to tell anyone. I called Zack's older brother, wondering if he'd noticed anything. He got quiet on the phone. This isn't the first time he final

I've been working at Mega Screen Electronics for 2 years. The pay was bad, but at least my co workers were cool. Our manager Blake checked his email and went white. Corporate had launched a surprise black Friday in July sale without telling any stores until that morning. They're advertising 70% off TVs, he said, voice shaking and we're the only only store in the district with a new PlayStation bundle in stock. We had three employees scheduled, me, Blake and Zoe at the register, normal for a Wednesday morning. By 10:30, there was a line of people wrapped around the building. Some had been waiting since they saw the email. At 6 a. M. Blake called everyone begging them to come in. Four agreed even though it was their day off. At 11 Greece, we opened the doors.

Yeah, tell them I sold it to you. See what happens. Still couldn't catch him. The administration went nuclear. They installed motion sensors in his locker, had teachers follow him between classes.

I was house sitting for my neighbor, Missus Chen, while she visited family in China for a month. Sweet old lady always brought me homemade dumplings and watered my plants when I traveled. The job was simple, feed her cat, water plants, collect mail. Easy money for a college student. Everything was normal for the first two weeks until I noticed the cat acting weird. Fluffy kept staring at the basement door and meowing constantly. I figured maybe there were mice down there. So I decided to check it out. Mrs. Chen had never mentioned the basement was off limits. I opened the door and immediately smelled something awful, like rotten food mixed with chemicals. I almost turned back, but I was worried there might be a gas leak or something dangerous. I grabbed a flashlight and went downstairs. The smell got stronger with each step. At the bottom, I found a makeshift laboratory, tables covered with beakers, tubes and bags of white powder. There were scales, lamps and equipment I didn't recognize. The smell was coming from several large containers bubbling in the corner. I realized I was looking at a drug lab. I ran upstairs and called the police immediately. When they arrived, they couldn't believe what they found. Turns out Mrs. Chen wasn't visiting family. She was on the run. She'd been manufacturing methamphetamine in her basement for over two years. The dumplings she'd been bringing Me probably helped mask the chemical smells from her cooking. The DEA told me the house had been under surveillance for months, but they never suspected the sweet grandmother next door. I've been living 20 feet away from one of the biggest meth operations in the city, eating food from a drug dealer, and I never had a clue.

I'm car shopping when the salesman named Brad latches onto me like a leech. Within five minutes, he's pushing me toward the most expensive car on the lot and refusing to take no for an answer. You look like a successful guy, Brad says, steering me toward a 75,000 dollar luxury sedan. This car matches your lifestyle, I tell him. I'm browsing with a budget of $25,000. Brad completely ignores. This budget is just a number, he replies. A man of your caliber shouldn't be driving some economy car. Brad starts his high pressure routine about limited time offers and how this car won't last the weekend. I've got three other people interested in this exact vehicle, he claims. When I try to look at affordable options, Brad physically blocks me from the used car section. Those cars are for college kids, he says dismissively. Let me show you what real success looks like. Brad keeps pushing, trying to get me into financing discussions. Then he makes his biggest mistake. He starts lying about the car's features. This model gets 45 miles per gallon, claims it's practically a hybrid. I know this car gets about 22 miles per gallon. He's lying to my face. The maintenance is basically free for five years. He continues. Luxury cars are actually cheaper to own. Here's what.

I was at my cousin's wedding reception when this guy, David, started bragging loudly about being a high powered attorney. He was wearing an expensive suit, throwing around legal terms and basically holding court with a group of impressed guests. I just won a 2 million dollar settlement last month, he announced. Personal injury case. The insurance company didn't want to mess with my firm. David was clearly trying to impress the single women at the wedding, name dropping famous law firms and talking about his corner office downtown. Something felt off about his stories. The legal terminology he was using was mostly wrong and his descriptions of court procedures didn't match reality. When someone asked which law school he'd attended, David said Harvard, then immediately started talking about his professors who were either dead or had never taught there. I'm a paralegal at a major law firm, so I know enough about the legal profession to spot obvious BS. But instead of calling him out immediately, I decided to let him dig his own hole. That's fascinating, I said, joining the conversation. What type of law do you practice? Corporate litigation mostly. David replied confidently, but I do some criminal defense on the side. Just wrapped up a murder case last week. Which court was that in? I asked innocently. The Superior Court downtown, he said vaguely. Judge Morrison or Judge Williams. I continued naming two judges I knew personally. David paused for a second. Judge Morrison. Yeah. Tough judge, but fair. Judge Morrison.

I hired this contractor named Tony to remodel my kitchen. He came recommended by a neighbor and quoted me $8,000. Seemed reasonable, so I signed the contract and paid him $3,000 up front. Tony showed up the first day with his crew, tore out my old cabinets and countertops, then disappeared for three weeks. When I finally got him on the phone, he had a sob story about family emergencies. When he finally showed up two weeks later, Tony had a new story. We ran into unexpected issues. The electrical work is more complicated than we thought. We need another $4,000 to finish. I looked at my kitchen. It was exactly the same as when they'd left, torn apart with no progress. What's electrical work, I ask? You haven't touched anything except demo. The wiring behind the walls isn't up to code. We have to bring everything up to current standards before installing new cabinets. This was complete BS. I had the electrical inspected six months earlier when I bought the house. Everything was perfectly up to code. Tony kept pushing. I've already invested a lot of time in this project. If you don't want to pay for additional work, I'll have to walk away. That's when I realized Tony was running a classic renovation scam. Take the money, do minimal work, then demand more cash or abandon the project. But Tony didn't know I'm a project Manager for a construction company. I know exactly how renovation projects work, what they cost and what permits are required. Alright, Tony, I said calmly, before we discuss additional cost, can you show me the electrical work that needs to be updated? It's.

I'm holding a measuring tape, not a PhD in grass management, but sure, I measure Frank's lawn. Three and a half inches. You're good, Frank. He pumps his fist like he just won the lottery. I knew it. Linda, Linda, he says, we're regulation. Twenty minutes later, Linda from next door shows up. I heard you're measuring lawns, he says. Can you check mine? The HOA sent me a warning letter. Now I'm apparently the neighborhood lawn referee. Linda's grass is 5 inches, technically over the limit. I tell her diplomatically, hmm. She says, what if I just trim the tips that count? I'm not equipped for lawn law interpretations. Word spreads fast. By noon, I've got a Line of neighbors with grass related disputes. Mrs. Peterson wants me to measure her rose bushes.

I decide to finally get in shape because my doctor said my fitness level is concerning for someone who's technically still alive. Motivational stuff. I figure I'll join a gym, do some cardio, maybe lift weights that don't make me question my life choices. I walk into the gym that looks normal from the outside, standard equipment, motivational posters, usual New Year, new you energy. But the moment I step inside, this guy approaches me like he's been waiting his entire career for this moment. Welcome, future alpha, he says with the intensity of someone selling life insurance to immortals. I'm Chad, your genetic potential awakening specialist. Genetic potential awakening specialist. I thought I was joining a gym, not enrolling in superhero training. I'm just looking for a basic membership, I say. Chad laughs like I just asked to pay with monopoly money. Basic, brother. You don't look basic to me. I can see the wolf inside you begging to be unleashed. The wolf inside me. The only thing inside me begging to be unleashed is last night's Taco Bell. And that's not really a fitness goal. Look, I just want to use the treadmill and maybe some weights. Chad shakes his head. Sadly, that's sheep mentality. You're thinking like prey when you should be thinking like a predator. He starts walking me around the gym, pointing at equipment like he's conducting a nature documentary. See that guy on the elliptical? Gazelle mindset, weak, but you. He stops and stares at me intensely. You have alpha wolf potential. I can smell it. He can smell my potential. I'm pretty sure that's just my deodorant failing under pressure. Chad leads me to his office, which is decorated with pictures of wolves, motivational quotes about predators and what appears to be his collection of protein shake trophies. Let me tell you about our elite alpha wolf.

If I detect negative energy during our ride, I'll need to perform an immediate cleansing ritual while driving. Safety first.

And she stormed off muttering about how I ruin everything and never let her be happy. Her guidance counselor, Mrs. Patterson, called me sounding genuinely concerned about my daughter's home situation. Apparently Emma had been going to her office twice a week crying about how I won't let her have friends over because I'm jealous of her popularity and wanna keep her isolated so I can live vicariously through her. Missus Patterson asked if I'd considered family counseling to work through my control issues. And Emma's friend Madison's mom Sarah texted me asking if everything was okay at home because my daughter told her I won't let her go to sleepovers because I have severe abandonment issues stemming from my own mother leaving when I was young and now I can't bear to be separated from Emma for even one night. My mother never left. She lives 20 minutes away and babysits Emma regularly.

I'm trying to build a simple deck in my backyard. Nothing fancy, just somewhere to put a chair and pretend I have my life together. I need to measure the space, so I buy a measuring tape. I'm out there Saturday morning measuring and making notes when my neighbor Frank walks over. Frank's the kind of guy who treats his lawn like it's Wimbledon and his garden hose like it's a sniper rifle. What's your measuring? He asks. Just planning a deck, I say. Frank nods, then points at his yard. Hey, while you got that thing out, settle an argument for me. My wife thinks our grass is too long, but HOA says it can't exceed four inches. Can you check? I'm holding a measuring tape. Not a PhD in grass management, but sure. I measure Frank's lawn. Three and a half inches. You're good, Frank. He pumps his fist like he just won the lottery. I knew it! Linda! Linda! He says. We're regulation. Twenty minutes later, Linda from next door shows up. I heard you're measuring lawns, he says. Can you check mine? The HOA sent me a warning letter. Now I'm apparently the neighborhood lawn referee. Linda's grass is five inches, technically over the limit. I tell her diplomatically, hmm, she says. What if I just trim the tips that count? I'm not equipped for law law interpretations. Word spreads fast. By noon, I've got a Line of neighbors with grass related disputes. Mrs. Peterson wants me to measure her rose bushes. The Johnsons need verification that their sprinkler coverage is adequate but not excessive. Then come.

I'm at this upscale steakhouse celebrating my promotion when this well dressed guy at the next table starts making a scene. He's loudly complaining to the waitress about his 80 dollar ribeye being completely inedible. This is the worst steak I've ever had, he announces, making sure the whole restaurant can hear. It's overcooked, under seasoned, and frankly, disgusting. I demand to speak to the manager immediately. The waitress looks confused because the guy had already eaten three quarters of his steak before complaining, but she gets the manager anyway. Sir, I'm terribly sorry. The manager says, what can we do to make this right? The guy, who I'll call Ken, launches into this dramatic performance about food poisoning risks and how his refined palette can detect poor quality meat. I've eaten at the finest restaurants in Europe. Ken declares this wouldn't be acceptable at a roadside diner. I'm not paying for this garbage. Ken demands his entire meal be comped, plus compensation for his ruined evening. He's threatening bad reviews and claims he's a food critic for a major publication. The manager is clearly uncomfortable, offers to remove the steak from his Bill. Ken rejects this and insists the entire table's meals should be free. Here's the thing. I'm a chef. I own three restaurants in the city, and I know exactly what a perfectly cooked ribeye looks like. Ken's steak was flawless. Medium rare with perfect grill marks and Proper seasoning. More importantly, I recognized Ken's technique. This is a classic dining scam where people eat most of their meal, then complain dramatically to get everything comped. I decided to intervene.

You know that frantic grocery run energy where you're basically racing against capitalism? That was me. I pull into the lot and there's one spot left, right up front. Beautiful. I take it. As I'm getting out, this woman in a beige Toyota starts honking, not quick beeps, full aggressive, laying on the horn like I just kidnapped her firstborn. She rolls down her window and yells, excuse me. I look around thinking maybe I'm in a fire lane or something. Nope, regular spot. I walk over and go, everything okay? She goes, I was manifesting that spot. I blink, sorry, what? I've been driving around for 20 minutes visualizing that exact parking space. I was sending positive energy to it. You stole my manifestation, ma'am. It's a parking spot, not a vision board. She gets out of her car and I swear this woman looked like she exclusively shops at stores that smell like sage and charge $40 for crystals. She's wearing flowing pants, 17 bracelets and has that haircut that says, I believe in essential oils more than vaccine. She goes, you disrupted my spiritual alignment with the universe. I say, lady, I just need milk. The universe can have it back in 10 minutes. She Shakes her head like I'm the problem. It doesn't work that way. You've stolen my manifestation energy. Now my whole aura is off. At this point, I'm looking around for hidden cameras because surely this is a prank. But she pulls out her phone and starts taking pictures of my license plate. What are you doing? Evidence. I'm posting this on my spiritual wellness group.

The wrong homeowner story. My HOA president Rick is the definition of a power hungry neighbour. This guy treats our subdivision like his personal kingdom, sending violation notices for the smallest infractions and making everyone's life miserable. Rick's been targeting me since I moved in. First it was my mailbox being two inches too far from the curb. Then my grass was inconsistent in colour. Last month he tried to find me $200 because my garbage can was visible for 20 minutes after pickup. Breaking point came when Rick sent me a certified letter demanding I remove my kids basketball hoop. According to him, it violated the aesthetic standards of our neighborhood. Portable basketball equipment creates visual clutter, his letter stated. You have 48 hours to remove it or face daily fines of $50. My kids have been saving for months to buy that hoop. It was perfectly legal on my driveway and caused zero problems. But Rick wasn't done. He started showing up with a clipboard, measuring distances, taking photos, acting like some property inspector. I'm documenting non compliance. He told me smugly. The HOA board will hear about your violations. Here's what Rick didn't know. I'm a real estate attorney specializing in HOA law. I know every legal requirement, procedural rule and limitation on HOA authority. Instead of arguing with Rick, I decided to do what I do best, research. Spent a weekend going through our H O. A's governing documents, state statutes and Rick's compliance history. What I found was fascinating, Rick had been operating outside his legal authority. Half the violation.

I inherited my grandfather's house when he passed away last year. It's a nice property with a pool and a small guest house in the back. I was planning to fix it up and sell it, but when I went to check on the place last month, I discovered someone had moved into the pool house. This guy had somehow gotten inside and set up a full living situation. Mattress, mini fridge, camping stove, the works. He'd even run an extension cord to the main house for electricity. When I confronted him, he had the audacity to tell me he had squatters right and that I couldn't just kick him out. I've been here three months, he said confidently. Legally, you need to go through the courts. Now I know my rights. The guy's name was Marcus. He acted like he was doing me a favor by maintaining the property. He'd apparently researched enough legal jargon to sound convincing to someone who didn't know better. You can't just change the locks or shut off my power, he continued. That's a legal eviction. I'll sue you. Here's what Marcus didn't know. I'm a real estate attorney, I specialize in property law, and I definitely know more about squatters rights than some random guy living in my pool house. But instead of correcting him immediately, I decided to let him dig his own hole. Okay, I said calmly, I'll need to look into The legal process. Can you show me any documentation of your tendency? Marcus got cocky. I don't need documentation. Adverse possession laws protect me. Look it up. I nodded. Seriously? I'll have my lawyer review the situation and get back to you. That night, I did some research on Marcus himself. Found his social media

Working night shifts at the hospital completely destroyed my sleep schedule. I come home exhausted but lie awake for hours staring at the ceiling. Melatonin didn't work. Blackout curtains didn't work. Nothing worked. Then my dad, a 20 year army veteran, noticed the dark circles under my eyes during Sunday dinner. You look like a zombie, he said. That night he taught me what his drill sergeant called the tactical sleep technique they use during deployments. First you lie flat and relax every muscle in your face, especially your jaw. Most people hold tension there without realizing it. Then you drop your shoulders away from your ears and let your hands fall naturally beside you. The magic happens with your breathing. Inhale quietly through your nose for four seconds. Hold for 7 seconds. This is the part most people skip. Then exhale completely through your mouth for eight seconds making a whooshing sound. The long exhale triggers your parasympathetic nervous system, basically telling your body we're safe now. Time to shut down. Repeat this 4, 7, 8 pattern four times while visualizing yourself in the most peaceful place you can imagine. The first night I tried it during my 3:00am wide awake panic. By the third cycle of breathing, I was out cold. Now I use it between shifts and can fall asleep within 90 seconds, even when my neighbors are having a party after Two weeks of practice, your brain starts to recognize the pattern as a sleep trigger. Last week, I finally completed a full 7 day rotation without energy drinks or sleeping pills for the first time in three years.

I was 4 drinks in when my phone buzzed, a message from my wife, working late. Don't wait up. My chest tightened. I had birthdays together and she'd missed three of them. I stared at those cold words on my screen until they blurred. I was tired of making excuses for her, tired of pretending this was normal. My thumbs hovered over the screen, then I typed what I've been afraid to ask for years, do you even like me anymore? Three dots appeared immediately, then disappeared, then reappeared. I held my breath. Part of me still hoped she'd say she loved me. Her response finally came through. It's easier when you're not around. The music kept playing. People kept laughing, but everything inside me went silent. I showed the text to my best friend. He looked at me with this sad expression and said, dude, she's been telling you this for years. You just haven't been listening. And he was right. The forgotten anniversaries, the separate vacations, the way she'd flinch when I touched her. I'd spent half a decade trying to Love someone who had stopped loving me ages ago. I ordered another drink and deleted her number from my phone that night.

My mom chose keeping the peace with my stepdad over protecting me. He moved in when I was 12 and immediately started criticizing everything I did. My grades weren't good enough, my room was never clean enough, and I was too sensitive. When I got upset, mom would just stare at the floor during his lectures, looking at her nails or suddenly finding something interesting on her phone. When he'd finally leave the room, she'd whisper, he's just trying to help you succeed. Or, don't take it so personally. Once, after I got an A minus instead of an A plus on my science project, spent the entire dinner listing all the careers that were now closed off to me. Said I clearly didn't have what it takes to be a doctor or engineer. Mom just nodded along, occasionally giving me that weak smile that meant, just get through this. When I tried talking to her alone about how much his criticism hurt, she'd sigh and say, he just wants what's best for you, or that's just how he shows he cares. But. But the thing is, he never acted that way toward his own kids. When they visited, they could get seas, and he'd ruffle their hair and say, better luck next time, kiddo. I started.

During the ceremony, right as the minister was about to pronounce them husband and wife, the bride's eight year old nephew suddenly stood up on his chair in the front row. Wait, he shouted. His voice echoing through the church. Everyone froze, think it was some cute planned moment. The bride, my cousin Rachel, smiled nervously. I saw Uncle Jason kissing that lady in the purple dress in the bathroom, he announced, pointing directly at the maid of honor. The smile vanished from Rachel's face. You could hear a pin drop in that church. Jason's face went completely white. And the maid of honor, Rachel's best friend since college, suddenly became very interested in her bouquet. Rachel's dad stood up, the wedding planner. I rushed over. The photographer awkwardly kept taking pictures. Honey. Rachel's mom tried to laugh it off. I'm sure you're confused. Why don't you sit? No, I'm not, the kid insisted. I had to pee before the wedding and the big bathroom was full, so I used the little one by the dressing rooms. They were doing kissy face and Uncle Jason had lipstick all over his mouth. Jason finally spoke up. Buddy, you must have seen someone else, maybe your Uncle Bob. The kid shook his head. You were wearing that flower thing on your suit. And you gave her your phone and said delete our texts. Rachel handed her bouquet To her sister, hyped up her dress and walked straight out of the church. The marriage lasted exactly 47 minutes, not even long enough to say I do.

There was this boy named Aiden, just 8 years old, who came in with third degree burns covering 70% of his body. His little sister Grace was only four and she was even worse, 85% of her body was burned. Their house had caught fire in the middle of the night. The parents were both working late shifts, leaving their 16 year old son Tyler watching the kids. When the fire started, Tyler got trapped on the second floor with his siblings. The stairs were already engulfed in flames. I was there when they brought them in. Grace was unconscious, barely breathing. Aiden was screaming in pain, his skin practically melting off. But Tyler, he was different. Despite having severe burns all over his back and legs, kept trying to get up. He wouldn't let us treat him until we promised to help his siblings first. Later we Learned what happened. Tyler had woken up to smoke filling the house. Instead of saving himself, he ran to get his siblings. He found Aiden first, but the boy refused to leave without his sister. The smoke was getting thicker and the flames were spreading fast. Tyler wrapped both kids in wet blankets and tried to find a way out. The stairs were gone and flames blocked every exit. That's when he made a decision that still gives me chills. He broke the bedroom window and threw his mattress down to the ground three stories Below, he grabbed both siblings, holding them tight against his chest and jumped. He twisted his body midair so his back would take the impact. The mattress helped, but the.

My grandpa gave me a bag of rocks for my 15th birthday, and I thought he'd finally lost it. I'm talking about literal rocks, not gems, not crystals, just regular gray and brown rocks he'd apparently collected from his backyard. They came in a crumpled paper bag with Happy Birthday, Becca written in his shaky handwriting. My parents looked mortified. My little brother Jake started laughing until mom elbowed him. Thanks, Grandpa, I said, trying not to sound disappointed. I mean, my friends got cars and iPhones for their birthdays. I got geological samples. Grandpa just winked and said, you'll figure it out, kiddo. For weeks, that bag sat on my desk, mocking me. I'd moved out most of my childhood stuff to make room for more mature decorations, but somehow those rocks stayed. Every time I looked at them, I wondered if Grandpa was developing dementia or if this was some weird test. And one night, I was stressed about this massive history project that was due the next day. I procrastinated until the last minute, and I was panicking about how I was going to research the entire Civil War in one night. I grabbed one of Grandpa's rocks without thinking and started fidgeting with it while I read. Something felt different about it. There were tiny ridges I hadn't noticed before. I held it up to my desk lamp and almost dropped it. There were Letters carved into the surface, tiny, barely visible letters that spelled, look closer. My heart started racing. I dumped the entire bag onto my bed and examined each rock under my lamp. Every single one had something carved into it. Some had single letters, others had numbers, and a few had tiny symbols that looked like arrows. It took.

My wife, Natalie, came stumbling out of the club bathroom with mascara running down her face. She was drunk and sobbing because the bartender she'd been flirting with all night rejected her advances right in front of me and all our friends. I stood there frozen as she grabbed my arm, crying about how he'd told her he doesn't get involved with married women. The same bartender who'd been watching her throw herself at him while I sat at our table pretending not to notice. The same guy who kept giving me sympathetic looks every time she touched his arm or laughed too loud at his jokes. Our friends avoided eye contact as I called an Uber. The drive home was silent except for her drunken sniffling. When we got home, I told her to sleep on the couch. We'd talk in the morning. But I knew there was nothing left to talk about. I laid in bed staring at the ceiling, my mind racing through the past five years of marriage, the constant accusations whenever I talked to female co workers, the jokes about how she could do better, the way she'd get blackout drunk and start fights at every social event. That's when I heard retching sounds from the living room. I found her hunched over the toilet, an empty pill bottle on the counter. Through her vomiting, she slurred something about taking sleeping pills. The prescription label said Xanax From 2,019 prescribed to Thomas Reynolds, her ex. My hands shook.

I'm a 28 year old barista named Laura I never thought my golden retriever would land me in federal court. It started when I got Benny from a rescue shelter. He's this adorable goofball who looks amazing in tiny sweaters. So I started posting pictures on Instagram. Nothing fancy, just Benny wearing different hats and outfits I'd find at the pet store. My posts were getting maybe 50 likes from friends and co workers. I'd caption them stuff like Benny's ready for winter or someone's feeling fancy today. I even made little stickers of his face to sell at the coffee shop where I work. People loved them. Then one Tuesday morning I woke up to a notification some woman named Shannon had tagged me in a post. I figured it was just another dog lover wanting to connect. But when I clicked on it, my stomach dropped. It was a cease and desist letter about my dog. Shannon claimed I was stealing her brand because her golden retriever looked similar to mine. She had this whole Instagram page with 80,000 followers called Princess Goldie's Adventures. Her dog wore flower crowns and fancy outfits. Shannon said my posts were confusing her fan base and demanded I delete everything, stop selling stickers and pay $5,000 in damages. I thought it was some.

When I was 9, my sister Millie was everything to me. She was 11 and basically my best friend, my protector, my partner and everything. Every Saturday we'd ride our bikes to Riverside Park with whatever loose change we could find between couch cushions, just enough for ice cream for Mr Louise, who parked his truck by the playground. That morning started like any other. Mom handed us each three crumpled dollar bills and told us to be back before dinner. Millie wore her favorite purple helmet with the scratch on the side from when she wiped out last summer. I had the hand me down pink one that used to be hers. We were arguing the whole ride there. I wanted strawberry swirl from the ice cream truck, but Millie kept saying vanilla was better because it went with everything. She was pedaling ahead of me, calling back over her shoulder that I had terrible taste and flavors. I was shouting back that she was boring and vanilla was for old people. We stopped at the intersection right before the park. There was a stop sign, but cars barely ever came through there. Millie went first. Like always, she was still turned around, sticking her tongue out at me about the ice cream thing when this red car just rolled through without even slowing down. The sound was horrible, like someone dropping a box of Tools down concrete stairs, but worse, metal scraping and this awful crunch. I stopped my bike and just stared. Millie's bike was in pieces scattered across the ass.

All electronic devices had to be locked in mindfulness lockers at the start of each day. But after what happened to my cousin Nathan, my entire school got rid of the rule overnight. It started when our principal announced this new electronics detox program. Every student had to put their phones, smartwatches, anything with a screen into these special lockers each morning. We could only get them back after the final bell. They claimed it would help us be present and boost focus. I hated it immediately. My mom was going through chemo at the time, and I needed to be reachable in case anything happened. When I tried explaining this to the administration, they just handed me a sheet of paper with the school's landline number to give to my mom in case of emergencies. They said Nathan had it even worse. He was type 1 diabetic and used his phone to monitor his blood sugar through a continuous glucose monitoring app. The school nurse said he could just come to her office to check instead, but her office was on the other side of our massive campus. First few weeks were awful. Kids were getting detention for sneaking Apple Watches under their sleeves. Parents were complaining about not being able to coordinate after school pickups, but the school wouldn't budge. Then came the day that changed everything. Nathan wasn't feeling great that morning, but the nurse checked his levels. And said he was fine to attend class. By third period, he was sitting in AP chemistry when he started feeling shaky. He asked to go to the nurse.

Guys, I am so confused. I went to Disney World's website to try to buy tickets for that new park in Abu Dhabi, but there wasn't anywhere to buy tickets. Can someone post the link? Will my son like Tron? That's it! That's the post. You don't need any more context. Post it anonymously! OMG you guys this was so funny I just had to share! See, my little princess's feet were tired after walking five and a half miles at Disney World today, so we found an abandoned wheelchair and gave her the royal treatment. Ride up to the front gates and we just had to get a picture in front of the castle. Ha ha! So funny! We're just so quirky like that. I found a bunch of really cheap pins on eBay. Can I trade these to Disney World? Oh also, they're from Seaworld. Y'all! The flower got stuck in my hair! Spending our day at Hollywood Studios. Does anyone know the fastest way to get to Super Nintendo World from the front of the park? My six year old has been talking non stop about it since we told him we were going. Is it gonna rain on our trip? And before anyone asks, no, I'm not giving you the dates because I don't want creepers following me around the parks. Should we stay at Bay Lake Tower or All Star Sports? I'm having a really hard time deciding this for My family of nine. Edit to add but it doesn't matter, I'm filthy rich. Chat GPT just told me there's only three theme parks at Disney World. Can anyone confirm this? So can I bring my wagon?

As a doctor, I immediately realized this is a sign of severe hypoxia. Before I could think of a solution, the water bottle in my hand began to twist and deform. Cups on the table began to shake violently. The flight attendants noticed that something was wrong. She quickly sat down, fastened her seatbelt, and urged others to do the same. But it was already too late. The next second, the plane encountered turbulence. The water in the cups began to float in the air, and passengers who hadn't fastened their seatbelts were sucked into the air by the powerful air currents. The pilot realized the danger, quickly putting on an oxygen mask. Cabin depressurized and oxygen masks fell from the ceiling.

Every day, I hang a water bottle in midair, poke three small holes in the bottom, use the bottle water as my shower. After washing up, I grab my headphones, put on my tank top to start my daily morning workout. But my workout spot isn't a park. It's a narrow, creepy stairwell packed with snacks and drinks hanging everywhere. After my workout, I kneel down and pray. But the object of my prayers is just a red backpack. My expression is serious though. If it weren't for this backpack that refreshes every day, being trapped in a stairwell for 35 years, I would have long ago. I finished praying, hold the backpack in my arms, unzip it, pull out a juice box, and stack it neatly against the wall. Then I take out a stack of cash.

See back in the fall of O2 when Marcus Freeman, as a high school football recruit, visited South Bend. His favorite part of the visit was joining the team for their game day Catholic Mass. However, when Freeman returned a few years ago, he found out that Brian Kelly ended that tradition, and he was shocked. So when Freeman took over the program and became head coach, he immediately got the approvals to bring it back. Even though Freeman personally wasn't Catholic yet, he just knew how beneficial this would be for his players and the university as a whole. For the last three seasons now, whether Notre Dame's home or away, the team attends mass together on Saturdays before games. And when they're playing at home, they go straight from the Basilica to the stadium. This journey LED to Marcus himself becoming Catholic, and it's brought the players on the team closer together.

So back in 2005, Jason Kelsey was a senior at Cleveland Heights High School. He averaged 9.5 yards per carry at running back and at linebacker he had 105 tackles. However, because he was only 6 foot 2, 225 pounds, coaches thought he should be playing Division 2 football and there wasn't a single D1 program in the country that offered him a scholarship. However, Jason's dream was to play at the highest level, so he walked on at the university of Cincinnati. As a freshman in 2,006, he redshirted and won Scout team Defensive Player of the year at linebacker. And then heading into his sophomore year, the coaches moved him to offensive line because they thought he had potential there. In 2,008 and 2,009, he was the starting left guard, and then in 2010, he was the starting center. He was second team all big east as a senior, but at 6 3, 280 pounds, he was 30 pounds less than the average NFL center. The Eagles took a chance on him in the sixth round of the 2011 draft.

And docks, bro, you had a petition of Native Americans asking to keep the photo on, keep the name is Redskins. Y'all was so scared of them Emily's online. Y'all went against the grain. When is y'all gonna realize social media is full of people who got opinions when they know they do dirt too, bro. Everybody on social media acts like they perfect when they know in IRL they probably done, did worse than half.

Angel Reyes is now facing backlash on Twitter because the monkey noises thing that people claim happened never happened. If you guys remember, they claimed Caitlin Clark fans were making monkey noises towards Angel Reyes while she was at the free throw line shooting, which she missed. What a WNBA said. That's cap. They stated that after a long investigation, reviewing video, audio, witnesses, um, people in the stands, etcetera, no one ever made monkey noises towards her while she was shooting free throws. In fact, her team never even heard monkey noises themselves. They got the accusation off of Twitter. Now the reason Andreas is facing backlash is because people are mad at the interview she did. She basically was telling them that, um, she's going through it good. She has a good support from her team, people checking up on her, other people from the WNBA making sure she's straight because of the situation now giving her Grace. She never came out her mouth and said the words I heard monkey noises.

Does anyone who's played football at any level knows that throughout the course of a season you'll see some scuff marks and some paint marks on your helmet. These marks from the contact sport from banging your head against other guys every play. When you see a player whose helmet looks like this, you think, oh my gosh, he's gonna destroy me. He's going to the NFL. But on every high school team, there was that one group of players who would scuff up their helmet on purpose. I was one of them. This is me playing center. It was so fun to do that it became part of my pre game routine. And we did it not because we didn't play. We did it because our equipment manager was meticulous about cleaning our helmets after every game. This is me before the last game of the season. My helmet looks pristine. But every week, an hour before kickoff, I'm rubbing my helmet on every inch of whatever locker room we're in. When we go out, it looks something like this with all the scuff marks. And then every Monday morning I'd come in and my helmet looks like this. We did this to our equipment manager, not to be jerks, but because he was one of those PE Teachers. Every public high school has one of.

Can we always make them this fun? Because this is a fun room. Let's be real, this is the most Browns and Cowboys rumor, whoever exists. The rumor here is Bruce Dennis. Some call him the Adam Schefter of the. Bruce Dennis is claiming that the Cowboys and Cleveland Browns are working on a deal behind the scenes that would send Dak Prescott to Cleveland. Dennis says he has a reliable source in the organization and adds that Cleveland would send quarterback Greg Newsome and draft compensation to Dallas. Oh my god. In exchange for Dak press got. I got a pretty darn good source within the Browns organization. Browns are negotiating as we speak with the Dallas Cowboys for a trade for deck. If this is true and the Cowboys don't do this, they are the stupidest fucking organization of all time. I don't know, and I don't think any of this works. I think the Browns would have the most fucked quarterback room with Deshaun Watson and Dak Prescott. It would be idiotic. It'd be paying 100 million to their quarterback and I don't think it.

Just completely rebuild. At this point, I support. It was a season from hell last year and now this is the offseason from hell. I understand at this point it is a rebuild, but like, say the stat you just told me. The stat is this. The Forty Niners have lost 10 players this offseason that have combined to appear in 536 six games for the franchise, earning 12 combined Pro Bowls and three first team all Pro. Not what do you have to show for all those fucking Pro Bowls and combined games? No, no, this is the worst part. Kyle Useck, Devo Samuel, all these guys put their blood, sweat and tears and are now no longer here. We have nothing to show for it. And the Fucking Eagles have a Super Bowl. I wanna go back to Jack's point of saying Chris Mccaffrey should get traded. What is the point of holding on to Chris Mccaffrey, 20 years old, coming off bilateral Achilles tendonitis whatever the fuck it was, if you're not trying to win right now? I've said to like, when we traded for Chris Mccaffrey, he was a great luxury to have, right? He's a great. He's. That is fun with a guy that like Chad Koch, Shanahan in that system.

I've done over 100 mock drafts and the key to drafting the best teams is to stay balanced. Meaning you should never let yourself be so weak at a certain position that you're kind of forced to draft it, even if you don't like the talent available. For me, my least favorite teams have been where I'm weak at wide receiver and kind of forced to draft them around 5, 6, and 7 where the talent just isn't as good. I've Learned three main tips that help me to stay balanced and make sure I always love my team. My first tip is that if you wanna go early tight end or early quarterback, don't do both. I do have a soft spot for drafting Travis Kelce in the first round and Patrick Mahomes in the third, but other than that, drafting a tight end and quarterback early is more likely to force you into drafting other positions later on. A second strategy has been to grab a good wide receiver in the first three rounds. That way you have at least one player at that position in rounds 4, 5, and 6 where the wide receiver talent is weaker. You can grab one if a good one falls to you, but you don't have to. The third tip, essential in any draft is monitor what positions your opponents have and what Positions they need. If they don't have those positions, and it's getting later in the draft, you better grab one on the way out, because you're probably not gonna get

How do I know that? Cause I win extra games every single year using the strategies I'm about to share with you. Let's start with the easy one, the kicker. And then we'll get to defense, which is a little bit more complicated. I know it's extra work, but I stream kicker every single week. It is shocking to me how many fancy managers will leave in a good kicker when they're playing in snow, wind, rain, terrible weather. Let me tell you something. An average NFL kicker playing in a dome is almost always better than a great kicker playing in terrible weather. You don't even have to do your own research here, cause if you follow this page, I tell you what kicker I'm gonna play every single week. Now we're onto defense. And I know some of you guys aren't gonna like this one. This is another position I stream every single week. And at times I'm even willing to hold a second defense on my bench. No. 1. I'm always looking at matchup for the team I'm gonna start this week. I do my research. I look for teams who may be playing a backup quarterback, missing key receivers, missing key running backs. That's gonna give you an advantage. Second defense I hold.

And because of this, we know exactly who will be in it next year. And that's because history repeats itself. Three years ago, we had the Bengals and the Rams. The orange for the Bengals and the yellow for the Rams. Two years ago, we had the Eagles and the Chiefs. The teal for the Eagles and the red for the Chiefs. Last year, we had the 49ers and the Chiefs. The red for the 49ers and the purple for Taylor Swift, because she was the main topic at this time. And this year, we have the Chiefs and the Eagles. The red for the Chiefs and the green for the Eagles. So it happened four years in a row, but now next year we have this. We have this right here. And what two teams do you think these are? And I'm not gonna lie to you guys, I see a lot of blue here. I see a blue on blue match up. The only thing that's throwing me off is this little San Francisco bridge and background right here. But even with that, I think this Super Bowl only has one answer, and that is the Buffalo Bills versus the Detroit Lions. Blue versus blue. This could finally be the Super Bowl that everyone wants. You get Josh Allen versus Jared Goff. This would be electric. If you guys do want free money on this year's big game, make sure you sign Up for Underdog Fantasy Better and Sleeper Code NFL Combo.

She clearly remembered locking the door three times that morning, but now it opened. With a single turn of the key. She realized that someone had opened the lock, but she refused to believe it and decided to investigate. Just then, a beam of light reflected off a glass ball and the woman was startled. She realized that someone else was in her home, so she quickly locked the door again, not bothering to pick up her phone that had fallen on the floor and ran frantically into the elevator. The woman pressed the emergency button in the elevator and explained to the property security guard that there was a thief in her home. When she ran outside, she bumped into the security guard who had come to check on the situation. Seeing that the woman was so scared that she had lost her shoes, the security guard hurriedly reassured her. After under.

No judgment, just saying that it might be bad for the infant that's supposed to be drinking from that source, because you might be interfering with a very calibrated system. Because what's normally supposed to happen, thanks to the wonders of the human body, is that when a baby goes to feed, when milk goes out, a bit of the baby's saliva goes in. And then from there, the mother's body will analyze that saliva to get an idea of what's going on inside the baby's body. And then I'll do some math to figure out what nutrients the baby needs and put those nutrients in the next batch. And if you don't believe me, feel free to look up all the different colors that a mother's milk can be because of this process, a process that would probably be thrown off if some hypothetical man decided to relive his glory days and latch on, because then the mom's body is gonna get some new readings and make the next batch, assuming the baby's eating nothing but like black coffee and chicken and rice.

This one's super important and it technically counts. I've never turned a woman down when it comes to an advance to do the dirty and not had it go horribly. We're in the worst case scenarios. I was screamed at. I was called names. I was made fun of in front of my friends. One of them said that they were gonna ruin my life somehow. And even in the best case scenarios with significant others, I would spend the rest of my night consoling them and reassuring them and comforting them as if I did something wrong by withdrawing consent. Where I feel like most women are just so not used to men saying no to that kind of thing that if they do, then it's just taken as a personal attack and it can't be anything else. And the thing is, when you do that, you end up with what happened to me, where you realize that no matter how, who the person is, best case scenario, worst case scenario, you just bite the bullet and go through the motions and you're not.

Now, most people don't know how resentment is built, but it's very simple. You not speaking up for yourself when you have an opportunity to do so, it's so bad, it not only will kill your relationship, it will misrepresent the person. And maybe you will kill a relationship with somebody that you can actually build with. That's even worse. That's like killing a loved one that's part of the team. That's friendly fire, and it's your fault. And that's the worst part. Most people don't know this, that if you don't let yourself become resentful, then that means that what you're really doing is you're standing up for the relationship. You're actually fighting for the relationship. So when somebody is okay to shut up and go, babe, I'm happy. If you're happy, don't look happy. You sound miserable. You wanna thrive with your partner. You wanna win with your partner. So it's very important that when you have an opportunity to either confront them or bear resentment, confront them every damn time, even if it's World War 3, because it's a representation of how much you love them. You will eventually learn how to confront people. Not a hard thing to do. Three or four interactions, you'll see how somebody likes to be confronted. They'll tell you, I don't like when you're harsh and critical. Please be soft and loving. You can tell me anything. You could tell me, I couldn't Perform in the bedroom. Just don't do it that way. Be soft. Or, hey, when you do it, really try to speak to me like it's bold. I need that. What happens is you start to create a loving relationship. You don't allow it to fall apart.

Now, most people don't know how resentment is built, but it's very simple. You not speaking up for yourself when you have an opportunity to do so, it's so bad, it not only will kill your relationship, it will misrepresent the person. And maybe you will kill a relationship with somebody that you can actually build with. That's even worse. That's like killing a loved one that's part of the team. That's friendly fire, and it's your fault. And that's the worst part. Most people don't know this, that if you don't let yourself become resentful, then that means that what you're really doing is you're standing up for the relationship. You're actually fighting for the relationship. So when somebody is okay to shut up and go, babe, I'm happy. If you're happy, don't look happy. You sound miserable. You wanna thrive with your partner. You wanna win with your partner. So it's very important that when you have an opportunity to either confront them or bear resentment, confront them every damn time, even if it's World War 3, because it's a representation of how much you love them. You will eventually learn how to confront people. Not a hard thing to do. Three or four interactions, you'll see how somebody likes to be confronted. They'll tell you, I don't like when you're harsh and critical. Please be soft and loving. You can tell me anything. You could tell me, I couldn't Perform in the bedroom. Just don't do it that way. Be soft. Or, hey, when you do it, really try to speak to me like it's bold. I need that. What happens is you start to create a loving relationship.

You didn't try to manipulate each other. You didn't try to force each other to be anywhere other than in front of each other, open and honest. You'd ask them about their past, they tell you, and you'd laugh, you'd laugh with them. They tell them about their past, you'd cry, you'd cry with them.

That's called Hypocritical. Revolution No. 2 working for a company with the name union in it. But then that company union busts its own employees. The irony writes itself. Revolution No. 3 not providing housing to help get the homeless off the street, instead just making homelessness illegal cause that fixes the problem. Revolution No. 4 baby powder companies selling baby powder knowing it had carcinogens in it so that they could make more money. Let me say that again. Baby powder companies sold baby powder meant for babies with carcinogens in it, and the only consequence was a small fine. That shouldn't be a true thing I can say out loud. Revolution No.. 5 insurance being more expensive than your mortgage. But it literally covers nothing. I'm ready for people to stop putting up with that. Revolution!

All right, let's see. Here are two of the states that were either all blue or all red. And as you can see, Oklahoma, my home state, 44th in education, 49th in healthcare, 44th in quality of life, 50th in test scores and top 10 worst poverty rates. If my state could read, they'd be furious about this. Massachusetts, on the other hand, is first in education, second in healthcare, first in quality of life, first in test scores and top 10 least poverty rates. So when you say that conservative policies are the best, I don't know what you're talking about because where's the proof? I believe the way I do because facts don't lie. If the facts showed that conservative states on average did better than every other blue state, I would have no choice but to capitulate. I would have to change my view that conservative policies are better because that's the proof. But that's not the case. Red states over and over and over again are the highest in poverty rates, have the highest infant mortality rates. But y'all say you care about kids, right? Well, the facts say otherwise. They have the highest maternal mortality rates, the lowest outcomes in healthcare. They also claim to have moral superiority, like they're the ones of family values. Well, family values aren't 16 year olds having kids because y'all have the highest teenager pregnancy rate, too. And this isn't To say that if you had a kid young that you're bad in any way, it's just to throw it back in the face of conservatives who say over and over again that they wanna protect kids and they're the ones of moral superiority, yet they're the ones that have the highest teenage pregnancy rate. Yet that's the thing they complain about other states having. So please, I mean, if I, if I'm missing something, show me, show me the evidence of how conservative states are better and where they perform better. Because every time I do research to try to see if a conservative state does better, the evidence isn't there. What are y'all better at? Genuinely, please show me what you're better at. Anyway, thank you guys so much for watching and have the day you deserve.

Revolution number two, politicians saying that children should have to work for their lunches. That actually happened. You should look that up. And I wonder how he would feel if this was his children that had to work for a meal. Revolution No. 3, hospitals being for profit rather than the well being of society. I'm gonna let you sit with that one for a second. Revolution number four, the government failing audit six years in a row, losing trillions of dollars and facing no consequences. But if the American people did that, we would go to jail. Revolution number five, taking out a 25 thousand dollar loan to go to school, never missing a payment for the next 30 years and somehow you still owe 85,000 dollars on your loan.

It's like constructing a mental shield that allows things just to bounce off instead of piercing through. Some may perceive it as zoning out or not caring, but in reality, it's about you safeguarding your heart and your peace because at the end of the day, you're gonna be the only one that is going to protect it. The way you do, reacting to everything and everyone keeps you in a constant state of edginess. And that tension that you always feel doesn't just remain in your mind, it goes into the physical.

Alright, for your birthday, we're gonna go to the ice rink and I'm gonna get you a big chocolate cake with Twinkies on it, right? So it's your birthday. How old are you? So we're gonna have it at.

And this is day 14. Hmm. So how does an acquired taste work? As babies, the only taste that we naturally like is sugar. But at four months old, we also start showing a preference for salt. Every other taste we have to acquire. I think one big misconception about an acquired taste is that it's just like learning to like something bad. But in reality, salty black licorice has a lot of pleasurable sensations. Sugar, fruit, herbs, as well as some bitter notes that put up alarm bells in your brain, which associates bitterness with poison. But after enough exposures, your brain realizes that it's not gonna hurt you and that it can ignore the danger signals, which lets you enjoy all the pleasurable stuff.

You're gonna wanna pick one of the first five flight feathers of a large bird. And feathers have a natural curve, too. So if you're left handed, feathers from the right wing will fit better. And then you have to manipulate the material. You have to soak the feather and then dry it out in hot sand to cure the grill and get that perfect combination of sturdiness and flexibility. Let's hope you're good at whittling because if you just slice a feather diagonally and try to write with it, think it's just gonna drain out and leave a big puddle.

The United States flag is described by federal statute, but the UK just uses this flag because of tradition. In 18 O, one King George the third proclaimed that it was his pleasure that the flag would be blue with red crosses. But that's not a law. Which means that if enough of us decided to just use this lime green version, it would only be a matter of time before this was the official version hanging in front of Buckingham Palace.

Also I know the name Men's Liberation sounds kind of weird, but it was actually a social movement in the 60s and 70s that was very focused on how societal norms and gender roles for men they were not only oppressive and hurtful for women, but they were the same for men as well like a very bell hooks patriarchy Hertz assault type vibe and actually in the very first chapter he talks about why men have such a high self unaliving rate and he explains that's in big part.

I want you dating me. So even though will has to go to jail for at least 18 months, you still want to date him? I've waited this long, and I really have not had a connection this strong with anyone. I can look past this. Hello? Hey, I was looking for will. Yeah, this is will. Will, how you doing, man? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Who's this? Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. It's a radio show. Oh, okay. What's going on? Not much. I'm calling you today because we actually had one of our listeners email us about you. Okay. Her name is Miranda. Oh, alright. And Miranda emailed us saying that she'd really like to go out with you again, but you haven't answered any of her phone calls or texts, and she was trying to figure out why. Yeah, that was, um, kind of tough experience, so. Yeah, that's. I just haven't called her back. Bye. She told us about your date, but I kind of want to hear from your perspective. Did you like your time with Miranda? Yeah, I mean, absolutely. But, I mean, did she tell you about the whole date? She told us about the movies, and then she told us about how you guys were, you know, parked in the car, making out. And then she told us about how the police showed up. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you really want me to talk about this on the radio? This is. I mean, it was kind of rough. Yeah, but you're on the phone with us now, so you're not locked up. It can't be that bad. Well, I don't know how comfortable I feel like sharing everything. I mean, I thought Miranda was a really cool girl, and I really. I thought we had a great time. Yeah, and she said she had a great time as well, but she's just. Obviously, if you get arrested on a first date, somebody's gonna have questions. Yeah, and can you. I mean, can you even imagine that she would even wanna go out with you again? Like, if you went out with a girl and she got arrested, you probably wouldn't call her back. Like, she's obviously a forgiving person. I'm kind of surprised that she called you guys or emailed you guys, cause they literally took me away and cops. So, yeah, I'm kind of shocked. But I think we really, like, got along and there was chemistry for sure. if you're answering the phone now and she's tried to reach out to you, why not just call her back if you liked her so much? Because there's more to it. Like, I made a bad mistake a while ago and I'm still paying for it. And regardless of how much I like Miranda and how good of our date went, Like, it's not gonna go well, because I'm gonna have to pay for the mistakes I've made, and it's all coming back on me now. So, just so she knows, I don't know if you're gonna get back to her or anything, but, like, it's not like I did anything horrible. Like, there's no, like, nobody got hurt. Nobody got, you know, hit or anything like that. Hit? Do you mean hit, like, physically, or, like, you're a mobster and you talking about, like, you know, put a hit on somebody? No, meaning, like, punched her, and he's like, there's no violence. It was a stupid thing that I did that, like, nobody got hurt. At, like, victimless. That's the word. But why don't. I mean, why don't you just tell her? Like, she's obviously a forgiving person. Like, if no one got hurt, right, then shouldn't be a big deal. Obviously, I'm not a serial killer. I'm. You know, I'm out right now, but I'm gonna have to go away for a while, so, like, the idea of dating someone or, you know, the. That's just not gonna happen for me, like, next year or so, too, maybe. What? It's not gonna be a thing? Like, it's not even a possibility, okay? And there's no way you can tell us what you did? Come on. Can we guess? You guys, this is not a game. This is serious. Like, I don't. I don't want to share what I did. It. It was stupid. I was. I was an idiot. If you won't share it with us, will you share it with Miranda? Because she's actually on the other line listening and wants to talk to you. Are you serious? Yes, I am. Miranda, are you still there? Hi, will. Oh my god. How are you? I can't believe this. Hi, um, I. I'm Miranda. I'm so sorry, cause I thought you and I had like an amazing time together and I thought we had chemistry, and I was just. It's just horrible luck and stupidity on my part. Well, people mess up. They make mistakes all the time. And it seems like. It's not like you murdered somebody. No, I didn't. I didn't do anything. No one got hurt. Like, I just feel like I've waited so long to meet somebody and we had such a great connection. So if you messed up, I mean, that happens. I just feel like if you just tell us what. What happened, what you did, you know, I can look beyond that. I just took it. I was trying to take advantage of a monetary situation that I thought was gonna go the right way, and it didn't. It went bad. And did you always know that you were making an illegal decision when you were doing it? You know, when it started off, it seemed like, no one's gonna know and no one's gonna get caught. It was like an innocent Thing that, like, no one's gonna miss this and that I was wrong. I was. I was an idiot. But, I mean, Miranda, like, just so you know, I gotta go away for at least 18 months. I'm not gonna be able to date anyone. That's why I didn't call you, because I'm so embarrassed that there's just nothing I can do about this. When you say you can't date anyone else, I mean. No, I don't want you dating anyone else. I want you dating me. Well, what? Are you serious? You can tell from a first date? Wait, so even though will has to go to jail for at least 18 months, you still want to date him? I've waited this long, and I really have not had a connection this strong with anyone. I can look past this. But you don't even really know fully what will did. Well, nobody was heard. There weren't bodies lying anywhere, so I

Hey, I was looking for Danny. Yeah, this is Danny. Danny, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Uh, good. I'm calling you today because you recently went out on a date with one of our listeners, and they gave us your phone number and asked us to call you. Really? Mm hmm. Her name is Amanda. She emailed us and told us about how you picked her up at a target. She thought that was a really cute move, by the way, and told us a little bit about your date, said that she really liked you, but I guess it's been like 2 weeks now and you're not returning her phone calls. Uh huh. Would you mind maybe giving us some insight into why it's been 2 weeks and you haven't called Amanda back? Uh, I guess I just can't see myself being in a relationship with her. And that's kind of what I'm looking for. Is it because of something she did on the date, something she said? I mean, I didn't get to know her really well, but she was kind of gross on our date. What? How was she, how was she gross? Just her manners. I'm not sure really, like how she was raised. And it was kind of shocking to me. Wow. I want, I'm very curious now, Danny. Yeah. Because according to her, your date was perfectly normal. She didn't do anything weird. The thing That she did say was strange about your date was how you shook her hand at the end. Is that why you shook her hand? Because you thought she was gross? Yeah, that's. I needed an exit. Can you give me one specific thing? Yeah. Was she sloppy when she was eating her food? She not put her napkin on her lap? What specifically made you think that she's nasty? Well, it was going fine and like halfway through the meal, she grabbed my hand and she leaned over into my ear and whispered, I'll be back in a few minutes. Okay. I have to honk out a dirt snake. No, she did not say that on the first day. Are you kidding me? You're lying. You're lying about that, Danny. That cannot be real. I swear to God. And she, what was that term again? What was that term again? Oh, man. She said, I have to honk out a dirt snake. Was she being funny or was like, this is legit? That's what I thought. I thought she was making a joke. And I just said, are you serious? She just said, no, really, I have to go download a brown load. I'll be back. No, stop it. She had to have been joking then. Yeah. I mean, come on. Come on, man. Like, I don't know one girl that would do that. No way. Seriously. She had to have been, she had to have been joking with You, Danny, she was not, she left. She was gone for a few minutes. I mean, at the time, I couldn't eat. I lost my appetite. That's how serious she was being. What did she say when she got back to the table? Like she had to have had a smile or been laughing. Yeah, she had a smile and she patted her belly and she said, she said, it looks like someone dropped the kids off at the pool. Cool. She's so good. Was your face red? I didn't know what to say. And she just jumped right back into her meal. And after a few minutes, she noticed and she thought I didn't like it. She asked me if I didn't like the food. And I said I just pretended I was feeling sick.

Yeah, cause you actually went out on a date with them, and now you're not calling her back. I'm not? Who am I not calling back? Her name is Rachel, and she said that you guys met at a house party and then went out to dinner, but the dinner had to be cut short because of a missing cat. Oh, the cat. It's the.

I thought maybe the cat was like outside or around the area. Yeah. So I was looking for her cat and it was really dark and I couldn't really see that well. And then a car came and hit me. What? You got hit by a car? Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, I got like a broken arm and I got a couple broken ribs. Oh my god. You're lucky. That's it, dude. Yeah, I've been in the hospital cause that happened.

Oh, okay, so. So you have an ex? Yes. And what is his. What is his name? Brian. Okay, and when did he become your ex? Like, how fresh is this? It was last year, but we still talk to each other all the time. Okay, so. But he's dating someone else now? Yes. And her name is Hannah, and she seems totally nice and everything. I know a few people who know her, too. They said she's super nice, and they seem happy together. But here's the thing. I keep telling her that Brian is doing things behind her back, and she keeps ignoring me when I try to help. Okay. Do doing what things behind her back? Talking to other girls, talking to me still, and trying to get me to actually hook up with him. So Brian is still trying to hook up with you even though he has a new girl? Pretty much. And I tried getting a message out to her, and she blocked me, so I just. Yeah. Oh, wow. Well, how did you try contacting her? Contacting her? Did you, like, DM her or something? Like, what'd you do? Yeah, I tried dming her through Instagram, but she blocked me. Right away she told her friends not to talk to me either. She told him I was Brian's psycho ex. But really, truthfully, all I'm trying to do is help her here. Okay, so you're trying to be the nice person here so she doesn't get her heart broken like you did? Basically, yeah. Okay, but she won't listen to you. Probably cause Brian himself is probably been like, ah, she's my psycho ex, don't listen to her. I guess, yeah. Okay, yeah, but the whole thing is. Didn't you say Brian was still trying to hook up with you? Like he's still trying to get with you. I mean, we're supposed to be going out for drinks this weekend and he specifically told me not to mention it to anyone because of Hannah. Oh wow, that's shady. Okay, so. But she doesn't believe you. Well, alright, what if we did this? What if we got Brian on the phone, okay, and then also had this Hannah girl on listening like on a third line. And then you sort of talk about hooking up or your little drinks date coming up. And then she'd be able to hear everything herself. That way you wouldn't have to convince anybody of anything cause she'd hear it for herself. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Okay. Alright, good. So it's an old fashioned Three Way call. We can set that up, no problem. Wait, do we have the other girl's number? Oh yeah. Do we Have this new Hannah girl's phone number? Yeah, I have her number, yes. Oh, okay, well, there you go. Three Way. Action time it is. We'll do that when we come back. Next we're gonna do an old fashioned zoo morning zoo Three Way. But before we get to the actual call. And we're ready to go with this. Yes. Okay, so please welcome Hannah to the show. Hello, Hannah. Hello. So, shag talked to you already, right? We're on live. Watch the language, that sort of thing. Yes. Okay, so before we bring her on, Hannah, tell us what you know about Chantal, your current man, Brian's ex. Uh. Oh, boy. Um, not much. Just that they dated, they broke up, and she's sort of crazy, I guess. Oh, okay, let's bring Chantelle on real quick. So, Chantelle, before we do this, what did you want to say to Hannah? Just that I am not crazy, and I'm only trying to prevent you here from getting hurt. That's. That's it? That's really it? Okay, Hannah, I mean, if. Okay, if you're just trying to help me, then what was wrong with keeping all this private? Like, why do we have to do all of this on the radio? Because you won't answer me when I try to talk to you. You blocked me on Instagram, that's why. Yeah, I blocked you because Brian asked me to. He said he didn't want you spying on him. Well, like I said, I'm only I'm only trying to help you here. Okay, so listen, we came up with this idea here real quick. We wanted to call Brian up, and then. Chantelle, why don't you ask him about your supposed upcoming date that he made with you behind Hannah's back and see what he says? Fine with me. And Hannah. We're gonna turn your line down while she's talking to him, but you're still gonna hear everything that's being said. Okay? I mean, I just think this is really immature, but whatever. Okay, hang on, Chantal. We're gonna call him up here, and when he answers, you're on. Okay?

I was like, go in, like, poke fun, get you. Good for you. Good for him for calling, I guess, and asking permission. Who's the other one? Tana. Mojo. Here's the thing about Tana. I've loved Tana since I was 13, 12. Where I'm confused with Tana is I have been not friends with her, but we have been close, like homies. I did her podcast, and it was like, we were talking about having, like, a fun night, you know what I mean? Like, for her to go do all that, and she. She was mocking, you know what I mean?

So I was like, perfect, I'll do it, but I'm not gonna do it if I'm having to share a room, because I had to do it with my ex on a show, and I regretted it. So when the rules were dropped that we had to match up and go sleep in the same bed, I bawled my eyes out for, like, a day. All of that wasn't shown, so I think. So you really went when to spend the night. That was a weird I. I was literally crying. I was like, I can't do this. Like, these guys are just gonna try and sleep with me. I don't wanna be here.

And then immediately they're walking into a bedroom. Is that what would happen if. Is that happening in real? That actually happened that way? You'd get ushered up. Right away.

I'm just gonna come out and say it. It's a machine gun that shoots grenades. Like imagine a bunch of grunts pouring a case of hand grenades into a pitching machine. Yeah, it's that this thing is capable of shooting 40 to 60 grenades per minute up to a mile away. And that's actually just when you wanna use it for direct fire like a gun. If you get bored and decide you want to take some half court shots, you can aim it up in the air and basically use it like miniature artillery, you know, for when you want to hit the bad guy with that. Yeet us. Delete us. Trying to tell you it's basically a fully automatic mortar. No. In case the enemies hiding behind a tank or something. Because a tank is literally what you're gonna need if you plan on being safe at all. Because this thing shoots M3 40 dual purpose grenades. And they are capable of penetrating up to three inches of armor. Should you find yourself not in a tank. The kill radius on one of these grenades is five meters in diameter, which is like 16 and a half feet. It's like that. You're definitely dead. Radius. If you're within like 50 feet of this thing when it goes off, you're probably gonna have a bad day. If you're inside the 16 foot kill radius, then well. Hmm. Your subscription to life just Got canceled. Her new pronouns are here and over there. If you're not picking up what I'm putting down, I'm telling you, somebody's gonna be picking

I build a Log Cabin for the whole month leading up to the 9th month of the pregnancy. Once the kid goes to get born, they get an all natural water birth in a bathtub. They do not get registered. They don't have a Social Security, a birth certificate, get any information that relates them to the United States of America like government. They're just a ghost. They are technically not even existed, not registered, not anything their entire life up to 6, 10 years old. I train them to kill. I train them to be an assassin. This kid can go out with just his nose, track down a forest, a bear, a fucking grizzly bear, any of it he can track down with just his nose and take out the heart with just his hand. The kid is a killer. He is an assassin. By the time he reaches 17 years of age, I realized that he is okay to release out of the wild. So I send him out of the wild to do all of my dirty work, go out killing people. He's a trained assassin, right? But we don't stop there. We also get the silicone mask of another person who is actually identified, will buy cameras. They have a Social Security. They have a birth certificate. The government knows who they are. I send this kid out with that silicone mask. He goes out killing people, political leaders, fucking giant billionaires, like big names, big people. He goes out killing them with a silicone mask on. But technically none of his DNA, none of his person, none of his name, literally none of it is associated with the database of any names in America. So they just have to go off that silicone mask. But the silicone mask of the person, they end up tracking down the actual.

It's important to keep in mind most European borders are invisible and residents enjoy freedom of movement throughout the block. So people rarely know when they're crossing a border. But as countries begin to close their borders to stop the spread of the coronavirus, some Polish border guards accidentally set up a blockade inside the Czech Republic. And it was a pretty easy mistake to make when you look at a map. The border blockade should have been here. But since the border guards had never enforced this crossing before, they accidentally set up their blockade here. When Czech residents tried to visit the church in the middle of the road, they were turned away by the Polish border guards since the Polish border was closed. But the church was in the Czech Republic. It's unclear how long the Polish border blockade was set up for a few days, under a week. But once news reached Prague that Polish border guards had annexed a piece of their country, a message was sent to Warsaw and the blockade was immediately moved to its correct location down the road. The Polish Defense Ministry said the placement of the border post was a result of a misunderstanding, not a deliberate act. It was corrected immediately and the case was resolved.

The event was started by three friends in 2002 who felt they severely lacked creativity in their lives. Their solution was to get a bunch of friends together, build complex suits of armor out of cardboard and get into epic medieval style battles. The first battle was a huge hit and the event series blew up. All the battles have a theme and the Box Wars team builds massive elaborate pieces for each one, like building an aircraft carrier, a monster truck. Participants are encouraged to make the most complex suits of armor possible, but are only allowed to use recycled cardboard and materials that could be found in packaging like tape or hot glue. There are four rules. During a battle, there are no winners, only losers. Use common sense during a battle, only recycled cardboard allowed. And after the battle, kids plunder the battlefield. And if a kid asks you for your armor after the battle, you must give it to them. The Box Wars team sets up kids workshops at each event to teach kids about creating with cardboard and help them build their own pieces.

In may of 2012, Susan Warren, who also owns a cleaning company was bored and wanted something to do. So she picked a house at random while driving down a street, broke into it, wash the morning coffee cups and dishes, took out the trash, vacuumed and clean the playroom. She then wrote a note on a napkin, $75, I was here to clean, along with her name and phone number and left it on the counter. The homeowner's 18 year old daughter was upstairs sleeping while Susan was cleaning. And when the daughter called her mother, Sherry Bush to ask about the cleaning service she had hired, Sherry said she hadn't hired a cleaning service. Sherry later called Susan to tell her she'd cleaned the wrong house to which Susan said, no, I didn't clean the wrong house. I just stopped in and cleaned your house. I do this all the time. Susan had been charged with criminal trespassing a month earlier. And even though Susan hadn't stolen anything, she pled guilty to attempted burglary and trespassing and was sentenced to one year probation. Susan was arrested again in February of 2013 when police found her shoveling snow from a driveway without the owner's consent.

Activision released data on the call of duty game franchise dating from the original call of duty released in 2003 through to Modern warfare's released in 2008 with the data collection ending in 2009. Since the franchise's first release, gamers had collectively played 475,000 years worth of gameplay every year working out to about 25 billion hours played over the data's six year period. At the time in the data release, over 100 million people have played a game of call of duty, a population greater than some countries. Thirty two point three quadrillion rounds have been fired. Thirty one billion care packages have been dropped which is enough to build 15,000 great pyramids of Giza or 100 Great Walls of China. And 5 billion cars have been destroyed, five times more than the amount of cars registered in the world.

Today we're talking about the E4 Mafia. Hypothetically speaking, all branches of the military have this organization. They go by a different name but the concept is the same. For example, the Marine Corps calls theirs the Lance Corporal Underground. Easiest way I can explain this to you is it is always the highest rank that you can achieve without having to become an NCO in the United States Army. That rank is the E4 Specialist, aka the full bird private rank insignia that has become so notorious it is known as the sham shield. If you don't know, NCO stands for non commissioned officer. It is a leadership type role. You are responsible for both yourself and those below you. Point I'm trying to get across is that in theory the E4 specialist is the highest skilled, most experienced soldier you can be in the United States Army while also not having any responsibility at all is because of that, E Four's partake in what is known as shaming. You're a lower enlisted person in the military. Your only responsibility is to do what you're told. Shaming is the sweet, sweet, beautiful art of avoiding being told to do anything that you may do nothing instead. I once knew an E4 that was so good at this everybody called him the shamerai. Another guy that was so good at going unnoticed, his code name was Waldo?

Either they don't understand the issues and they're voting on something they don't understand, or they do understand the issues and they understand that by voting for Trump they will harm people, and they do it anyway, making them a bad person. Or the third category, which is that you are willfully ignoring every piece of data that contradicts your viewpoint, making you a fucking idiot. Right. And I had hoped that during the first Trump presidency that when people's lives got worse, they would become educated by the fact that their lives had become worse under Trump. The problem is, he didn't actually get that much done in his first presidency. Right? A lot of it was struck down by the courts. A lot of it was at very targeted groups who weren't voting for him anyway. Right. A lot of it got turned over. Turned the second Biden took office. So what I'm fearful for and what gives me a bit of hope, is I'm fearful that Trump's second term will be much more effective, that he will have the courts on his side.

Like, I'm serious. I think when we first watch Undercover Boss as a society, we should have started burning buildings down. Okay, because if you don't know, Undercover Boss is a show where they take the CEO of usually a relatively major brand, they put them in a disguise, and they have them work a week at one of the minimum wage positions at their company. And they can never do the fucking job. the subway guy could not make a fucking sandwich for the life of him, all right? They. They are incapable of doing minimum wage positions. Every CEO I've ever seen on that show is incapable, even after a week of. Of performing adequately at a minimum wage position.

People aren't stopping playing it. And I and I'll be honest with you, hell divers too, their servers are shit, like really bad. But to be fair to you, the first Hell Divers at best had 7,000 congruent players playing at one time like that. That was it. Hell divers too is in the top 10 most played games right now and I'm of course going off of steam and PlayStation. I believe it is in the top three right now, which is crazy. Hell divers 2 is actually competing with fucking Fortnite and APEX right now. What? What? That's a different video.

He pitched the idea of wearing a wig to the offices showrunners, but Greg Daniels refused, saying he would know if John was wearing a wig. But rather than turn down the role, John went to the Office's hair stylist Kim Ferry for help. In secret, Kim had a Jim Halpert wig made for John and before filming one day they secretly put the wig on and went and filmed the scenes for the day. After filming, John left the wig on and drove to Greg Daniels office and once again pitched all the reasons why you should let him wear a wig for the remaining episodes of the season, but Greg Daniels kept saying no, I would know if you're wearing a wig. So John lents across the desk and said I don't think you would and remove the wig from his head. Greg Daniels responded by saying wow, you guys have some balls, referring to both John and Kim, but he agreed to let John cut his hair and wear a wig for the rest of season three.

Now, most parents in the situation where they catch their kid vaping for the first time, they're gonna grab the vape, they're gonna destroy it, and then they're gonna ridicule and punish the kid. But that's exactly what you don't want to do, you see, because doing this will only cause your child to resent you, and it won't actually solve the problem. Instead, do this. If you find out for the very first time that your son is vaping, don't say anything. Let him think that this is his little secret. Then one day when he's off at school, you were going to start a fire in his bedroom. By the time he arrives back home after school, he will see the whole house engulfed in flames. He'll freak out. He'll call his parents and the fire department, if they're not there already. And then when you and the whole family is outside of the house, one fireman will come up to you and say, it looks like the fire started in that corner bedroom from a vaping device that exploded. Now, after your son hears this, he'll instantly burst into tears and start apologizing. He'll feel super guilty, and all you have to do is put your hand on his shoulder and say this. Look, son, accidents happen. Your mother and I will pay for all the damages as long as you promise to never.

And he looks at this whole issue like a beaver looks at running water. Absolutely fucking not. We can't have it. So his administration goes about figuring out the cheapest way to solve this cheese problem. Obviously, we're gonna throw it all in the ocean. However, having at least the foresight to understand that that would cause political backlash, he wanted to see how the public would receive it. So someone from his administration shows up to a White House press conference with a five pound block of moldy cheese and is like, hey, we got 500 million pounds of this shit. How would you guys feel if we threw it in the ocean? It'll be fun. We'll save money on cheese. We're gonna find out if blue whales are lactose intolerant. It's gonna be a great science experiment. The public did not go for it. They kind of felt like, hey, I've paid taxes for the last 40 years. You've turned those taxes into cheese. I would at least like the cheese.

See, this is Kyle Mccourt, a name that Ohio State fans know all too well. He was essentially run out of Columbus this time last year after a poor performance against Michigan in which he threw two interceptions in a 30 to 24 loss. Fast forward to today, where OSU's new transfer quarterback Will Howard also threw two picks against UM and lost 13 to 10 after heading into the game as a 21 point favorite at home. While McCord, who's now at Syracuse, just outdueled arguably the best QB in the nation, Heisman candidate Cam Ward and his Miami team headed north to take on the orange in a game where a win sent them to the ACC Championship. They look to be well on their way, taking a 21 to nothing lead in the second quarter. However, Kyle McCord and his offense had different plans, coming back to win 42 to 38 thanks to his 380 passing yards and three touchdowns. All those scores and over half of those yards came from both receivers Trevor Penny and Jackson Meeks, who combined for 13 238 and three. Also, shout out to the O line and Laquinton Allen. Those guys went dumb.

He signed a one match contract with a club called Paro FC, the winners of the Bhutanese league, to play in continental competition in Asia, something called the AFC Challenge League. They had a preliminary match against a team from Nepal called Church Boys United. He signed a one match contract for that match.

This is how I'm gonna raise my son to become a billionaire. So right when my son turns about 5 months old, I'm going to hire two nannies, one male and one female. These nannies will practically raise my son. My wife and I will still be in the picture and we'll definitely be there to help raise him as well. But right when my son turns around 3 years old, we're gonna tell him that me and my wife aren't his parents. His actual parents are the nannies. I'll end up telling my son that I'm his uncle and that I'm brothers with one of the nannies. And then the nannies will continue to stay in his life and act as parents until he's around 8 years old. Once he's 8, these nannies are going to go on vacation and then my wife and I, as his aunt and uncle are going to watch him for the weekend. But when these nannies are on vacation, their plane is going to violently crash and my son will think that his parents died when he's 8 years old. From there, my wife and I will take over as legal guardians to my son and we'll start to raise him as our own. Now, doing this will cause my son to grow up with a lot of hardship and will help.

Literally none of it is associated with the database of any names in America. So they just have to go off that silicone mask. But the silicone mask of the person, they end up tracking down.

So I could like say I wanna go to the bathroom, but like my body won't let me. I think if I'm taking a poop, women don't do that. Princesses don't do that. There we go. How long do you wait? Well, my brain doesn't communicate with my butt really. If I have to go, you're gone. I'm going and I will go in there, turn on some water, some water. The water death, death music like just roar. What are you doing to that toilet? Like, I just wanna make sure what, what in the Bucky's brisket sandwich are you eating in there? I have to make sure that the music. Yeah, it's so loud and obnoxious. Girls poop so fast. Cause you turn on the sink. I do. And then like, did you just wash your hands? Like it's just on 1, 2, three, done.

Then one day Doritos came out with this new flavor called Buffalo Ranch Doritos Jacked. And they were the best Doritos on the planet by like 10 miles. And I probably we ate a bag of them every day for several years straight. Then one day they just disappeared and they quit making them, seemingly for no reason. I can only assume it's because it was driving down the sales of all the other flavors cause they were the best Doritos ever. And now guess what? I just don't eat Doritos anymore because every time I eat a normal Dorito or a Cool Ranch Dorito or for a sweet chili Dorito, I go out. It's like a shittier version of Doritos Jacked Buffalo Ranch and I don't even like it anymore. Okay, because you gotta realize people are creatures of habit. I would have habitually eaten a bag of Doritos jacked every day till I died if they gave me the option to. But they took Doritos jacked away. Then they essentially broke my habit for me and I just never went back to eating normal Doritos. Okay, so it was a giant mistake to have the promotional item in the first place? Because if they didn't have that, I probably would have just kept eating normal Doritos for the rest of my life. But no, they fucked it up.

Was that like a teeth situation or maybe like a sharp rock? Or do they just leave it until it rotted away? Cause like, bro, that's not very hygienic. That's like the opposite of hygienic.

Turns out the dad or the mom aren't actually the parents of the child. They had raised a kid for five years and found out that it wasn't their baby. If neither the man or the wife are the parents, there's only one answer. The hospital switched the babies at birth. So the parents immediately contacted a lawyer and decided to sue the hospital. And they won. They won $2 million. But the story doesn't end there. If the kid that they've been raising for the last five years wasn't their child, where was their biological kid? Well, the biological kid got sent home with two different parents. And after two years of those parents having the kid, they lost custody due to neglect. And so the baby from two to five has been in foster care this whole time. The parents go, great, you know, we can just. We can go get our child. It's in foster care. You know, this is kind of working out good. But here's where the other twist is at. The state of North Carolina told them they have to file for adoption, like if it wasn't their own kid. Which means they had to wait eight months in order to be able to adopt the kid. And had to pay $40,000 to adopt.

What I revealed in that meeting changed everything. The producers were breathing down our necks for a successful film. This time, they were ready to make some budget cuts to work on future endeavors. When our producer started congratulating Rowan in front of me, thanking him for driving the project, I realized he was trying to erase me, my partner. Rowan was, on the surface, charming, confident, always talking about his vision. But he let others sweat over the details while he swooped in at the end to take credit. Rowan always made promises he never kept. I'll handle casting, he said. But when auditions came, he was too busy. I stepped in. I'll manage the budget, he claimed. Weeks later, he hadn't even opened the spreadsheet. So I handled that, too. By the time we were on set, I realized I wasn't Rowan's partner. I was his unpaid crew. I thought the work would speak for itself, but Rowan started talking and production meetings. He bragged about the script he wrote, the casting he nailed, the edit he was perfecting. Meanwhile, I was pulling all nighters, red eyed in front of my laptop, cutting scenes until the sun came up. I started keeping note of the proof of my work. I started with a script. Every draft was saved on my laptop with creation dates and revision histories. Rowan hadn't written a single line. I pulled our email chains. Hey, can you finish the storyboard? I don't have time. You're better with dialogue. Just write this scene, handle the shot list. I'll focus on big picture. On the editing software. Every cut, every render, every export had my username on it. I started taking screenshots while I worked, even short screen recordings of my editing sessions. And just when I thought I had enough, Rowan started telling the crew that I've been dropping the ball, that he was fixing my mistakes. So I saved the text messages he sent me at 2:00am, saying don't forget to have the trailer ready tomorrow. The trailer? He later told producers he stayed up all night cutting. My evidence folder. Looked like a detective's case file.

You can go next door, but we can't change their prices for you. Whatever. Can I just leave my car where it is now? I'm gonna be honest, probably not. But which one is your car? It's that brown one. Um, ma'am, your car is in the middle of the road. No, it's not. I pulled off onto the shoulder. There is no shoulder on this road. That's a lane. Okay, well, whatever. Just figure it out. Okay.

The guy who said this after he got breathalyzed means you're higher than twice the legal limit. Twice in legal minute. This is Daniel Rodriguez. And in 2022, he got pulled over because of erratic driving and not signaling. When the officer approached him, he immediately noticed he was under the influence due to Daniel slurring his words and speaking at a high pitch. After asking him to perform a field sobriety test, Daniel failed horribly, leading to his arrest. When the officer brought Daniel back to the police station to breathalize him for his blood alcohol level test, came back saying he was twice the legal limit, leading Daniel to say this. What is that? 1, 8? What does that mean? Means you means you're higher than twice the legal limit. Twice in legal minute. Twice the legal limit. Question up. Oh my god. Afterwards, Daniel was charged with felony DUI since this was his second charge while driving under the influence, leading him to get three years supervised probation and 180 days in jail. As of today, Daniel now works as a warehouse stocker for Aldi in Dallas, Texas.

What do you mean? How many cases did I order? 35, like you said. That is not what I said. I said three to five. I, I thought you said 35. Why would I need 35 cases? How many pies and cobblers and waffles do you think I'm making? In my mind, I thought 35 cases of blueberries was a lot. But you know what? I am a smart man. I also know when the wife speaks, don't question her. You have a much happier wife. 18,000 dollar worth of blueberries just landed on Tickle's head. He was only supposed to order 3 to 5 cases. Because he misheard, he ended up with 35. Under the blazing sun, the Berry started heating up and rotting and it felt like money was being thrown straight into the trash. When his wife, Carol, saw this, she blew up on the spot, demanding to know how many pies and cobblers he thought he could possibly make. The restaurant was already strapped for cash and this mistake was like pouring gas on the fire. Tickle stood there without saying a word, fully aware that he had really messed up this time. Carol's face only grew colder, even hinting that if he couldn't fix this, there might not be a place for him at home anymore. Pickle knew the restaurant couldn't possibly handle this mountain of blueberries, and if he didn't come up with a plan, they'd all rot. Away. So he came up with a wild idea, to turn all 35 cases into Moonshine, hoping this risky gamble could cover the financial hole and maybe save his marriage. But nobody had ever made blueberry liquor before, and whether the market would accept it was a total mystery. Was Tickle's choice going to be a desperate turnaround or the final straw that completely blew up his already shaky home life?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There's no way I can get it off with just my hands. This is brutal. Can you give me some morphine or something? Yeah. We're in urgent care center. We don't stock narcotics. Are you kidding me? As Dr. Bglider continues to care for the injured worker, the urgency escalates. He quickly realizes that the tar, which has begun to harden on the man's hand, could be even more dangerous than anticipated. If not treated immediately, it could lead to serious complications like compartment syndrome, where swelling in the limbs causes blood flow to be restricted, leading to tissue death. To make matters worse, the urgent care clinic lacks the necessary resources to treat the injury as thoroughly as an ER would without narcotics or the right equipment. Dr. B. Glider improvises using petroleum jelly in an attempt to soften the tar. But as the minutes pass, this situation becomes more dire. Just when Doctor B. Glider is at his wits end, a sudden thought strikes him. Mayonnaise might be the solution. His PA runs next door to a burger joint and comes back with industrial sized tubs of mayonnaise. As strange as it sounds, the oil based substance starts to work and the tar begins to loosen, allowing Doctor B. Glider to carefully remove it. While the worker's hand is saved, another emergency arises. Jessica, the woman who claimed to be tired of her husband, suddenly collapses in the waiting room. Dr. Bglider rushes to her side, but as he's stabilizing her, he's called away again, this time for a child who's choking. A chaotic day is unfolding in the clinic, and Dr. Bglider is running on pure instinct, knowing that saving lives is his top priority, even when resources are scarce.

Daniel, a 20 year old, was enjoying his vacation by the pool. What he didn't know was that within minutes he was about to witness a terrible scene. He had been lying on his deck chair for over 20 minutes when suddenly a man appeared. He was holding his baby by the feet upside down. The child wasn't crying. On the contrary, he was quiet and not struggling at all. Daniel was shocked, but no one around seemed to react. The young man felt that something was terribly wrong. He decided to discreetly follow the father. Daniel was determined to find out what was happening and why this man was carrying his baby like a worthless bag. But Daniel could never have imagined what he was about to discover. What this man was hiding was horrifying. Tap the plus button and comment, father, for Part two.

She could pack an entire house in 48 hours, make friends at every new base within a week, and somehow kept three kids fed, clothed and in school through eight different moves. She ran every FRG meeting while dad was deployed, organized care packages for the whole unit, and never missed sending him his favourite beef jerky. Even when money was tight. She was the one other spouses called at 3:00am when they couldn't handle another night alone. Dad was coming up on his 20 years, and mom had been planning for this moment since deployment number three. She'd saved every penny she could, researched real estate in Colorado where her sister lived. Even picked out the exact house she wanted with the wrap around porch. Just one more year, she kept saying. Then we can finally plant roots for real home. The kids can finish high school in one place. The re enlistment ceremony was supposed to be next Tuesday. Mom thought it was Dad's retirement ceremony. She'd invited her whole family from Colorado, bought a new dress. Hell, she even made a photo album of all our moves titled The Journey to home. I helped her glue every picture. There was one of her crying in the driveway of our first base housing, pregnant with me. Another of her painting my Sister's Room for the fourth time in a different house. Written little notes under each one. Things like Move No. 3, left behind the garden I planted. And move No. 6. Tommy's best friend stayed here. But here's the thing. Nobody knew dad had already re enlisted three months ago. Signed. Another six years without saying poop. And that wasn't even the worst part. Mom found out at the F R G. Christmas party. We were all there. The whole battalion family thing. Kids running around with cookies. Some Colonel's wife talking about resilience or whatever. Mom was helping serve punch when she overheard two lieutenants wives gossiping by the dessert table. Did you see Major Wilson with Captain Brooks at the P X. Yesterday? They weren't even trying to hide it anymore. The other one laughed. 20 years his wife's been waiting. And he's spending his reenlistment bonus on jewelry for another woman. Mom's hand froze on the ladle. I watched her face change real slow, like watching ice form on a window. She sat down the punch, walked straight across that community center. And stood right in front of dad. He was laughing with some other officers by the Christmas tree. Is it true? That's all she said. Real quiet. Everyone around them stopped talking. Dad's face did this thing where he tried to look confused. Honey, what are you. Reenlistment Captain Brooks, is it true? The whole room was dead silent. Even the kids stopped running around. You could hear the shitty Christmas music playing from someone's phone. Dad straightened his uniform, looked her right. In the eye. We should discuss this at home. Mom laughed. Not a real laugh. The kind that makes your skin crawl. 20 years. 20 years I've waited for you to come home. Really come home. Not just between deployments, not just for a weekend home. Her voice was getting louder. I've been the married, single mother. I've been the mover, the cracker, the keeper of everything while you played soldier. And you couldn't even tell me. You signed away six more years of my life. Some colonel tried to step in, saying something about maintaining decorum. Mom turned on him. Decorum? Decorum? Where was decorum when I was in labor with our second child and he was in a rock? Where was decorum when I had to explain to our son why daddy missed his high school graduation for a training exercise? She turned back to dad and Brooks. Really? She's 23 years old. Dad's jaw tightened. Linda, you're being hysterical. This is what military wives do. You knew what you signed up for. Maybe if you understood sacrifice. Sacrifice? Mom pulled out her phone, started scrolling. Let me tell you about sacrifice. I have 4,000 photos on this phone. You're in 217 of them. I know because I counted. I counted while you were deployed. Again. She threw the phone at his chest, bounced off his metals. I sacrificed my career, my family, my friends, my sanity, my children's stability, everything! For what? So you could fuck your Co worker and sign up for more years without asking. You're embarrassing yourself, said picking up her phone from the floor. And me in front of my command. Mom nodded real slow. You're right. I am embarrassing myself. Believing for 20 years that this would end, that I mattered as much as your precious career. She looked around the room at all the other wives. Some were crying, most were just staring. How many of you are waiting for retirement, too? How many of you think it'll be different when they hit 20? Nobody answered. Mom walked over to the dessert table, picked up the sheet cake that said Merry Christmas, 4th Battalion families in red and green frosting, walked back to dad and dumped the entire thing on his dress blues. The frosting hit his medals with this wet splat sound that made Katie gasp behind me. Red and green icing dripped down Dad's chest onto his shiny shoes, while chunks of yellow cake stuck to his ribbons. The whole room just froze. 300 people watching cake slide off Major David Wilson's dress blues onto the waxed floor of the Fort Carson Community Centre. Colonel Miller pushed through the crowd and stopped right in front of dad, his face turning purple. He didn't even look at mom, just stared at the mess on Dad's uniform and said real quiet, that dad better be in his office at 0 600

When you found out you were pregnant, you immediately thought it was Mr Sidney. Yeah. Or he was there. You thought, let me get my calendar out. Well, I knew I was pregnant because I never miss my monthly cycle. So I knew that just being a day late, I already knew I was pregnant. Why'm I not on the birth certificate? You didn't wanna be there for the birth? You didn't wanna be on the birth certificate. You didn't wanna be at the birth when you came to bring the kids to, to see the baby, you wouldn't even. Wait a minute. What's his relationship been like with Aslan since she's been born? Doesn't really pay much attention to her. Um, he won't hold her.

The burden on your life is the fact that you can't keep your pants up when you supposedly supposed to go visit your children. That's a burden on your life. It's lack of self control. You're right. But this baby is innocent. Yeah, true. So whether or not she is in fact your child, she deserves better than to be called a thing. You're right. You're right. That's very hurtful.

She pays more attention to my brother. And I don't want her to go through that. I don't want her to see and pay attention to the other kids and she's not getting love from her dad. That's her fault.

A part of me does, but if he acts the way that he does, no. I mean, I want him to be there for our kids. Yeah, for the kids, not you. Okay. But it doesn't matter. You should still be willing to help me out anytime. I want him to babysit. He wants me to pay him. Why should I have to pay you to pay, to pay him to watch his own kids. To watch the two children you know for certain are his. Yes. Mr Sdaniel, it is nothing that bothers me more to hear in this courtroom, is it a parent of a child calls themselves babysitting their own kid. You don't babysit your own kid and therefore, you're not entitled to payment. That's ridiculous. Now, I'm trying to figure out why in the world is she trying to purposely have a third child with a man that she got a paid to babysit for the two that you already have? This whole story, it doesn't make sense to me. When people begin to manipulate and sneak, you want to control him? I just want my family together. You want your family together? I think that our, our kids deserve to have both parents. Now we're getting.

Dad never held back when it came to my looks. Every time I came downstairs wearing makeup, he'd shake his head and say, all that effort for what? You can't paint over ugly. When I turned 16 and started talking about maybe going to prom, he laughed and said, save your money. Nobody's asking you. Anyway. The worst part was how casual he was about it. Like he was just stating facts about the weather. Mom never said anything when he made these comments. He just get this uncomfortable look and change the subject to homework or chores. My little brother Ethan would roll his eyes, but he was only 13 and more interested in his video games than family drama. Dad worked construction and came home every night complaining about his back, his boss or how expensive everything was getting. But he always had energy to comment on my appearance. You inherited your grandmother's nose, he'd say during dinner. Poor girl. At least she found someone desperate enough. When I started my senior year and mentioned maybe going to college, he scoffed. What's the point? You'll just end up pregnant and dropped out anyway. Might as well learn to cook now. The breaking point came three weeks before graduation. I've been accepted to the community college and gotten a partial scholarship for my grades. I was so excited I printed out The letter and left it on the kitchen table for everyone to see. When dad got home and saw it, he didn't even congratulate me. Instead, he looked at me and said, college won't fix your face. You're still going to be too ugly to find a husband. Better learn a trade that doesn't require dealing with people. That night, I called my friend Jake from chemistry class. We've been lab partners all semester and he was one of those guys who is genuinely nice to everyone. He never made me feel weird or ugly like other guys did. Wanna help me prove my dad wrong about something? I asked him. He didn't even ask what it was before saying yes. The plan was simple. Jake would come to Sunday dinner and pretend to be my boyfriend. I coached him on little details about our fake relationship. We've been dating for two months in chemistry class and he was planning to study engineering at the state university. Jake was actually really good looking, played soccer and had this confidence that made everything seem easy. Sunday came and I spent extra time getting ready, not because I thought it would make me pretty, but because I wanted dad to see I'd made an effort. Jake showed up right on time wearing khakis and a button down shirt, carrying flowers for mom like I'd suggested. When I introduced him as my boyfriend, Dad's face went completely blank during dinner. Jake was perfect. Complimented Mom's cooking, asked dad about his construction work and even played video games with Ethan. Afterward, he held my hand at the table and called me beautiful twice, once when he thought dad was listening. Every time dad tried to make one of his usual comments about my appearance, Jake would jump in with something positive. I love how Jenna always knows exactly what she wants, Jake said when dad mentioned I was too picky about restaurants. She has great taste. When dad brought up my unfortunate features, Jake looked genuinely.

The man can fight dirty too. Yeah, approximately 80%. Holy. Have you ever seen a fist fight? You are delusional. Have you ever, my dear? So, Brock Lesnar, I think he's like well over six feet. He's probably over 200 pounds. Could your mom beat him up? You said he's six feet. Forget. Just forget his height. Let's say this is 5 foot Brock Lesnar. Could your mom beat up Brock Lesnar? UFC? She might. She might be able to. Okay, you're so. Oh my god, you're delusional.

We don't have a lot of Spanish or French speaking customers, but if we do, I'm hoping that we can count on you for those translation services. Yeah, I'm happy to offer translation services. Does that come with an additional payment? Is it separately invoiced whenever you have to use my services or how does that work? No, your pay doesn't include bilingual services. Your, um, the salary that we're currently offering, it's, it's just, it's just in general. But, um, we do ask, uh, that you participate actively in the improvement of our company and sometimes we have to communicate with, you know, people who don't speak our language and you would be a great asset if you could just do that for us sort of like a favor out of sheer curiosity. If I were to not be available to translate or I wasn't fluent in multiple languages, um, how would you communicate or how have you been communicating with your non English speaking clients? Um, we would contact the translator line that we've been using. So, so your company is willing to pay a translator line to translate, but you're gonna have someone in house that can provide these services on demand whenever needed and you're not willing to pay extra for that. And the reason I'm asking is because, um, I paid a lot of money to learn French and to Become fluent in Spanish and it wasn't a favor that someone did for me. I had to put in the time and I had to put in the effort to learn these languages. Um, even English like I I'm fluent in English and that's something that not a lot of people can say these days. So, um, it's just funny to me that you use the word favor, but you're willing to pay a translator line. So, um, as far as my bilingual efforts, uh, again, you can either add pay to my salary to use those or I can invoice you separately whenever they're needed or we can just remove them as an optional together and I can just completely speak English all the time.

There were too many customers calling in yelling Being disrespectful cursing out our agents and we're just not standing for that anymore so we're basically like the funnel that gets rid of the customers that are acting up and then we let through the customers that call in with respect those are the customers that you know we help and they get what they need and they go on their merry way but the customers who call in you know treating our customer service agents as if they're beneath them those are not the kind of customers we want so basically we just we don't even get you over to that department if you're if you're being a little too extra if that makes sense am I being transferred or not? It's up to you if you're gonna get transferred or not you've been a little you've been a little much right? You caught that I guess. Yeah. No, you let me know because if I transfer you and you get loud over there the system automatically registers that and it drops the call mm hmm yeah, we're not playing these games with you guys anymore. Nope. Listen, I don't wanna get hung up on so I'll just call back I'll just call back okay. Yeah, you call us back when you feel like you're ready to talk like an adult okay? Yeah, whatever you say alright, take care. Bye bye.

Yeah, I was approving payroll and I noticed that there were some additional hours on your time sheet. Yes, I added 2 hours to my time sheet for last week. Why would, why would you add two hours of pay? Well, because you called me at home on Thursday, remember? Yes, of course I remember the phone call. I just, I didn't think it was that big of a deal. You asked me to check my emails. You actually asked me to respond to a couple of the emails because they were time sensitive. So anything after five PM is now considered freelance time and I have a minimum of two hour pay that I require on my own time. And I saw that you put it as overtime. Yes, of course I put it as overtime. It was over the 40 hours that I had already provided you for the week. I just don't know if upper management's gonna approve this. I, I don't know if they're gonna approve the two hours. What do you mean you don't know if they'll approve it? Did you ask them for approval before you called me at home and asked me to do work on my own time? I don't know how you're gonna figure this out, but I worked and again, anything after 5:00 is my time and as a freelance contractor on my own time, I require a minimum of two hour Pay. So I don't know how you're gonna pay it, but I work those two hours. It took me just about those two hours to read all the emails you wanted me to read and respond to them. So I'm not sure how you're gonna figure it out, but I expect to see those two hours on my paycheck. Your generation is something else. If by something else you mean we don't let corporations take advantage of us and guilt us into giving them every possible moment of our lives for barely any pay, sure, I'll be something else. The only something else I'm worried about is those two something extra hours that I'm gonna be getting paid. You understand? Why do you breathe like that? You're so loud, bro. Like it's getting faster.

Hey, I have some good news for you. Good news. You're gonna stop asking me for my seconds. Haha, very funny. No, we actually decided to bump your pay and we're going to be placing you as a salaried employee instead of hourly. What's the catch? There's really no catch. Um, the only thing is that salaried employees work typically an average of about 60 hours a week just because of like the on call schedule and all that. But other than that, there's really no catch. So you want me to work more hours for less money? Less money girl. Didn't you just hear me say I'm giving you a raise to 85,000? That's a 15 thousand dollar pay bump, right? But if you break it down, if I'm getting paid my current salary, which is $33 an hour, I make about $70,000 a year. With your raise at $85,000 a year divided by 3,160 hours, which is what 60 hours a week comes out to, I'm getting paid 27 ish dollars an hour. So you want me to take a six dollar pay cut and work more hours? No, thank you. I'll stay hourlyly. Veronica, I'm confused. Um, there's a sort of prestige that comes with being a salaried employee. I thought you'd be excited. Prestige is a code word for more work. And no, I'm good. Thank you though.

And if we need to have it, then we're gonna go to HR, and then all of us are gonna be there, including this mystery person.

Can I have your pay stubs? Sure. I'm so sorry. You make too much to live here. Maybe try the luxury apartments. You might qualify over there. Hi, welcome to luxury apartments. Can I see your pay stubs before I give you that really quick question? Um, why are they considered luxury? They look like every other apartment complex in the area. Good question. Nothing but the name. Actually, we haven't updated anything in at least 10 years but with having the name luxury in the apartment complex name, we don't have to accept Section 8 or any type of government funded assistance. Let me take a look at your pay stubs. So sorry, you don't make 3 times the amount of any of the rent, even the minimum. So we're not gonna be able to help you. Have you tried buying a house? So the low income housing just told me that I make too much. How can I not make enough here? I don't understand that. I really don't think that I am in a position in my life to buy a house at this moment, especially because you're telling me I can't rent so how can I buy? I don't.

It's Annabelle from your math class. The one who always has their headphones on? Yeah. How did you get my number? I just asked your friend Jason. And he gave it to you, huh. The audacity of this dude, just handing out my number to anyone without letting me know. Do you not want my number? No offense, but not really. Well, um, I was wondering if you wanted to get to know each other a little. I have a girlfriend already. Sorry. I mean, we don't have to be dating. It wouldn't hurt to just be friends, right? Uh, no disrespect, but I'm not really interested. I think you're a little lost right now. Yeah, you're probably right. Ha, ha. But don't think I'm going to give up that easily. Whatever floats your boat. Hey, it's me again. Hey. Can I ask you something? Of course. Were you the one that put that love letter in my locker with the heart chocolates? Maybe. Did you like the chocolates? No, I just threw them away. Oh. Uh, they were homemade. Also, just for the future, can you avoid putting stuff in my lockers? My friends were making fun of me because of it. Yeah, sure. Sorry about that. Hey, Annabelle, you need to learn how to take a hint. You've been texting me more than my girl, and I've been turning you down straight up each time. Does it bother you? A little, but I don't Really? Mind? I guess. So you like it when I text you? Haha, no chance. Oh, also, I was wondering what you were doing tomorrow. Nothing as of right now. Why? Well, I don't know if you knew or not, but there's a blue moon tomorrow and I know this really nice spot near the lake and I was wondering if you maybe wanted to come. Lol, why would I wanna go with you? We aren't even friends. But thanks for the great date idea. I'mma ask my girl if she wants to see it with me. Oh, ha ha, no problem. I'll just watch it on my own. I like being alone anyways. Yeah, I can tell. Hey, did you see that Mr. Matthews put us together for the presentation? Unfortunately, yeah. Isn't that great? No. My friends are making fun of me again because of you. I understand. Sorry again about that. But you don't understand. You don't have any friends, do you? Not really. Yeah, I expected as much considering how lame and antisocial you are. Lol. Anyways, what are we supposed to do about the presentation? Um, if you're free tomorrow, you could come over to my place and we could work on it together. If that's okay with you. Sure, I guess. What time? It's seven PM. Okay, yeah, that works. Awesome. See you tomorrow. Alright, I'm outside. I'll be there in a minute. I'm playing with the cat right now. The cat? Yeah, she's Not mine. She's a stray cat that always comes over and I feed and play with. Here, play with it. So you're like, touching it? Yeah. Why? What if the cat's like carrying a disease or something and it's all filthy and stuff? I don't really mind. She's super cute and she needs some love. Yeah, yeah, whatever. Can you hurry up though? I'm freezing out here. Oh, sorry. Coming right now. Hey, the presentation went pretty good, right? Yeah, I think we got a good grade. We worked better together than I had expected. I know, right? Do you think it's okay to call you a friend now? Ha ha, no. Say what you want. I believe that we will become friends eventually. And I believe that you are being extremely delusional. Hello? You didn't come to school today. Yeah, I woke up pretty sick today. It's because of that cat. I told you so. Maybe I'll send you over the notes from today. Is there anything else that you need? Well, I do kind of want some chocolates. Alright, I'll be over in an hour or two. Thank you. I appreciate it a lot. Yeah, no problem. Also, uh, maybe try not to get sick again. What's that? Are you worried about me? You wish. Haha. I'm just bored and I have nothing to do right now. Thanks for yesterday, by the way. The chocolates really cheered me up. Yeah, no problem. Also, did you see our grade? For the presentation. We got a 98. Yeah, I saw. Couldn't have done it without you. That means a lot. Thanks. Anyways, what are you doing today? I'm playing with the stray cat again. I named her, too. Didn't she just get you sick because of her? What did you name her, though? Sakura. Like the Japanese cherry blossoms. It seemed to fit. That's a nice name. I know, right? Hey, your outfit was cute today. Really? Yeah. Thank you so much. That's the first compliment I've had in a long time. Relax, I just said it was cute. No need to overreact or anything. Anyways, I was wondering. Apparently the stars are gonna be really nice out tonight, and I wanted to ask if you wanted to go see them with me. Are you asking me on a date right now? No, it's not like that. Just to, like, you know, hang out and stuff. You know what? Whatever, I guess. So. Wanna meet at the lake? We can go to that spot that you mentioned the other day. Sounds good. See you then. Yeah, see you. Hello? Hey, what's up? Well, I heard about you and your girlfriend. I'm sorry. No, don't worry. It was bound to happen. Really? Why? I don't know. We just weren't, like, clicking anymore, you know? That's sad to hear. Anyways, I bought two tickets to the Olivia Rodrigo concert, and the second ticket doesn't really have an owner anymore. And I don't Know if you listen to her or not? But if you do, I was wondering if you wanted to go with me. Are you kidding me? I love her. I'm so down to go. Awesome! But do you want me going with you? Yeah, why not? I don't know. What if your friends find out and make fun of you again? Who cares about my friends? They're a bunch of losers anyways. So I guess this means we're officially friends. Sure, I guess. You're my first friend. Hey, what do you want? Why did you ignore me at school today? Why? Cause you're a freak loner. What happened to us? I thought we were friends. Friends with you? Lol. Yeah, that's never happening. Why are you like this? You toy with my emotions and get close to me. Then you are cold all of a sudden again. I should have known it was too good to be real to begin with. I was never close to you. The only thing we did together was a project. Don't think I had any feelings for you. So that entire time you didn't consider me as a friend even once? No. I thought so. I don't know why I'm even surprised. I should be used to stuff like this by now. Hey, why weren't you at school today? I'm sorry for what I said yesterday. I didn't mean it. Can you forgive me? Hey, you weren't at school today again. I'm sorry again. Is there any way I can make it up to you? It's been a year since you made your way up to heaven. I just wanted to let you know that I never threw away the chocolates. I ate them. They were really good, by the way.

Can you come home? I bought you a new car. Don't come home. Dad found your alcohol. What? He told me not to tell you. That's why I'm using Snapchat. What about the new car? Wake up, bro. You're not getting a car. But dad sent me a picture. I saw it in the driveway. It's a trap to get you to come home. Then whose car is that? Dad bought it for you, but he's going to return it, teach you a lesson. What lesson does that teach? I don't know. I told him to keep the car, but he's just so mad. How did he find the alcohol? He found it under your bed. Why was he looking under my bed? I don't know. Why are you helping me? Because we're family. Is mom making tacos? No, she's in your room looking for more stuff. Crap. Mom's involved, too. What do I do? Don't come home. I have to come home at some point. The moment you come home, you're getting grounded for a long, long time. AD keeps texting me. What should I say? I do have one idea. What is it? It won't get you out of trouble, but it might save the car. What's the idea? Say you don't want the car. Say you want me to have it. Just hear me out. Dad bought you a car, but he's returning it as a way to punish you. Right? Right. But if you Say you don't want the car. Then returning the car won't be a punishment. I guess. But why would he believe me? Because you still have one advantage. Dad doesn't know that you know his plan. Dad doesn't know I know he found the alcohol. Exactly. And since we're using Snapchat, there will never be any proof that you told me. Tell dad to give me the car, and I will let you drive it whenever you want. You got it. Sis, you coming home? Come take her for a spin. Hey, dad. I really wanna come home, but I can't be around my sister. We just got in a big fight. What happened? I probably shouldn't tell you this, but I caught her and her friend drinking alcohol. I told her to stop, but she wouldn't listen. So I took the alcohol and hid it in my room. She yelled at me.

Just a hobby of mine. What the hell is the hobby? Is it to piss people off? No. Ha ha. How did you even get my number? I asked the landlord. He said he's asked you many times, but you keep doing it.

But that just means she wasn't the right one for you anyways. Can we talk about something else? Yeah, sure. How much longer will you be making this noise for? I might invest in some earplugs. It's not that bad. Stop it! But tomorrow should be the last day. Well, let me just say I'm excited to finally get some peace. Well, I'm glad. Anyways, I'm gonna get back to work. Talk tomorrow maybe? Uh. Oh my god, it's getting louder by the minute. Sorry, I'll tone it down a bit. Oh my god! What is it that you are doing that is so important, but yet you can't tell me? Why do you need to know so bad? I don't need to know. I just wanna know. Because you are the only person making this type of noise in the complex. I'm surprised everyone isn't complaining about you. And I told you I'm almost done. After that, you won't need to hear from me again. Oh my. Alright, just finish up. It's 8:00. You have an hour. Okay. And gosh, turn off that music. Sounds like a screeching cat. What? No way you can listen to that! I have to. You don't understand. You're so annoying. Okay, Today is the day you told me you would be finished. I will in a couple of hours. Are you at least going to show me what the hell it is that you've been doing all this time? I could, but you have to promise not to make fun of it. Sure. I mean, I think I've already made fun of you enough. True. Alright, let me get back to work. I'll text you when I'm done. Sure. Alright, I'm done. Oh my god. Finally!

Visit all the fun places. Eat and swim all day. I still like you as a person. Adam? Hello? Are you there, Adam? Sure. Have fun. Hey, babe, we're at the reception.

Why are your kids playing on my son's PlayStation? It's not your son's PlayStation anymore. The PlayStation is in my house. And in this house, we all share. That's ironic. You've got seven kids, but none of them share the same father. Wow, very mature. Well, then your son's been very naughty today, so unfortunately, he doesn't get to play on it. Are you for real? I bought the PlayStation, so I get to decide who uses it, and I choose my son. Well, I have custody of your son, and I decided he doesn't get to play today. So if you have a problem, take it up with child welfare, because I don't care. Plug. AI, give me a response to this. I got you, bro. Here, say this to her. You're lucky you got a fat, because you have nothing else going for you. That's funny, but this fat is the reason you put a baby in me. Whatever. Just give my son his PlayStation back, and we won't have any problems. Nah, not happening. Bet. Bro, I need your help. You in or out? I'm in. What's good? Tanisha won't let my kid play on his PlayStation, so I need you to do some stuff for me. Sure, I got you. First of all, I want you to hire a van and spray paint free Playstations on the side. Wait outside her youngest kid's school and entice them into the van once He's in. Interrogate him. Make sure he leaves never wanting to touch a PlayStation again. And after that, you're gonna go to their house. You're gonna sneak in in the middle of the night and start a fire. I'll make sure my kid isn't there when you do it. The closest fire station is 4.2 miles away. This means they have approximately 2 minutes. 34 before the fire trucks turn up. In this time, you're gonna flee the scene. When they finally arrive, they'll put the fire out and perform a quick search. I'll have my friend tell them that the fire was caused by the PlayStation. And he'll tell them all that it's okay because mistakes happen. But unfortunately, they couldn't save the pets that were inside. So by now, all of the kids are crying, petless and terrified of Playstations. And they'll never want to touch another again, allowing me to play with my son completely undisturbed. When do we start?

Okay, then why are you always busy and not able to hang out with him? Um, it. Are you. Are you still trying to process the fact that he made out with his cousin when he was a young boy? He told us about that little awkward moment during your date. Oh, I can't believe he mentioned that. I couldn't believe he told me that you still liked him after you found out he kissed his cousin. You know, it was a little awkward when he brought it up, but. And he, you know, he's kind of really nervous, too, and. But it was all really endearing. You know, he's a kid. Yeah. It wasn't like he was saying he was 25 years old. Yeah. And, you know, he. It wasn't like his cousin. He went out with his cousin before he went out with me. Right? Yeah, right. Oh, dude, I just had coffee with my cousin in a huge make out sesh. I'm so excited to bowl with you right now. Yes! So I don't get it, though, because I'm sorry. Every guy I've ever met, I'm a pretty busy person, but if I like them, you make time for them. Yeah, totally. I just, um. I just had a situation. Something happened, and I just couldn't see him. You know, I needed some time. You needed some time or you got, like, another relationship going on or something? No, no, Nothing like that. No, no, nothing like that. Okay, but there's something going on in your life where you can't make time to go out with him, right? I had a bit of a situation, and I just need some time before I could see Him again. Okay, it sounds really shady. I'm just gonna be honest. Is it shady? It's not. It's not shady. Um, it's embarrassing for you. For me? Yes. What is it now? We're dying to know. Yeah, I have to know now. I just need another week at least before I see him again. That's all you need. A week, and then, yeah, my situation will be done and over. What? It's another relationship? Your divorce is gonna be final in a week. Your divorce is gonna be final in a week. Is that it? No, No relationship. None of that. Just, uh. Just a little, um, uh, procedure that I have to have. You're getting fake boobs? No. That would be a nice surprise, though. Yeah, he'd be excited about that. He'd be like, I'll wait a week. That's fine. Like a medical procedure.

Hey, Violet, it's Jack. I'm sorry, who? Jack. We met off tinder. What up, girl? Remember me? Um, no, you don't. We totes hung out like five times. Sorry, I think you have the wrong number. No, Violet. Hey, Violet, don't hang up. This is actually Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. I'm moving 92.5. Okay. Okay. You. We've never met on Tinder before. Do you listen to the radio show at all? I mean, I've heard of it. You've heard of it? Okay. You recently went out with one of our listeners, and now you're not calling him back. And he likes you a lot and would love to see you again. But since you're not answering his calls, he asked us to call you and see if we can get you on the phone and ask if there's something wrong with him. His name is Derek. Okay. You remember meeting Derek off of Tinder? Yeah. Derek says he's been trying to get a hold of you for a little while after you guys hung out a few times. Do you not like Derek? Well, he's a liar, and I really don't deal with liars. Oh, what do you mean that he's a liar? Everyone I meet on Tinder is a liar. I and I really don't have time for guys like that. Do you mind telling us what you think? I don't mean to say what you think. Cause that assumes that he didn't lie. Do you mind telling us what he lied about? Well, Derek told me he had Seahawk tickets and that he was gonna take me to the next game. And then the game came and went, and guess what? No invite. Wait, so, okay, Violet, you feel like he lied to you about inviting you to the Seahawks game? Yeah, obviously. He probably doesn't even have Seahawks tickets. He's probably just trying to make himself look good, being all like, oh, yeah, I have Seahawks tickets, baby, I wanna take you. But don't you think maybe he was. Maybe he could have invited you to another game like you. You might be jumping the gun, assuming that he's just a lying jerk right away. I'm sorry, what's your name? Jubal. Jubal, um. I didn't call you. You called me. True. Okay. And I'm telling you the truth. He told me that he had Seahawks tickets and that he was gonna take me to the next game. So he's a liar? Because he didn't fucking do that. Did you? He is a liar, just like every other guy I've dealt with. Okay, did you. I mean, did you ask him about the game afterwards or. Honestly, I don't even want to talk to him anymore because like I said, I just don't deal with that. Wow. Okay. It just. You sound so upset. Uh huh. And you don't really have proof that he doesn't have tickets, right? He just didn't invite you? I'm. I'm just a little confused. Okay? What don't you understand about the fact that he told me he was going to take me somewhere and then he never invited me? That's the lie. Got it. Are you alright? Thank you, Violet. Thank you for explaining it to me that way. I do understand now. And I agree. I wouldn't want to go out with somebody that lied to me either. Especially if they strung me along with, like, going to Seahawks game or something and they never invited me. So I understand why you don't want to call Derek back. Finally, you get it. How many times do I have to explain this to you? Hey, Violet, I'm just. Don't judge me. And don't call me Violet. Violet, I'm not judging you at all. I'm actually on your side. I'm saying if he lied to you, then you have every right to be upset at him. Okay, whatever. I don't. Yeah. Hey, Violet, before I let you go. I know. I can sense. Who's the girl back there? Who's the girl? She keeps making those snarky comments. Yeah, that's me. Violet. Violet, I can sense that you want to hang up the phone, but I. Just hang on for one second, okay? What else do you have to say? I don't even know why I'm still on the phone with you. What the else do you have to tell me? I don't. I don't have anything else to say. To you. But Derek does. Oh.

You let him cheat on you a couple more times, maybe it'll make the love stronger. Dave, listen, Lexi, what you're saying sounds ridiculous. Have some self respect. It's not easy. I want someone who will treat me right. Seems like they don't exist. Maybe the guy you're texting right now would treat you right if you gave him a chance. Dave, we can't. You're my best friend.

I'm just struggling to let go completely. I want you, and I love what we have, Lexi. I want us to work. But for that to happen, you have to leave your past. I want that more than anything, and I'm going to prove it. Starting now. Lexi, I saw you kiss Alex today at school. What happened to letting go of the past? I didn't mean for it to happen, but I got lost in the moment. How many times? Lexi, you keep on swearing it's over, but here we are. I know. It's just. He's saying he's changed, and part of me want to believe it. Anged. Is this a joke, or are you delusional? I don't know, Dave. I'm a mess. He's asking for another chance, and I might say yes.

All right, so here's the deal. You recently went out with a girl named Heather. You remember going out with Heather? I do remember going out with Heather, yes. Why are you asking me about it now? Well, because Heather emailed us saying that after your date, which was the most romantic date she's ever been on, by the way. After your date, you stopped texting her, and she's wondering why. Wow, that is a. That's a real grown up move there, Heather. What? Wait, I don't get it. Like, are you upset by that? Are you being sarcastic, or that she emailed the radio station to complain about why I'm not calling her after our date? So this wasn't even that crazy of a first date for you? For me? No. For her? If it was for her, yes. Okay, I knew. I knew it would be that way, and that's. I mean, it was all by design. Okay, wait, I'm confused. The way she described you, you were charming, you were Romantic.

All right, so we can get you on the phone as quick as possible. Okay, I can understand that. If you wouldn't mind just telling us why you're not wanting to talk to her. Look, we had a lovely time, and I got what I wanted out of the date. What? Get what you wanted out of it? But you. Yeah, she. You didn't even kiss her at the end. What did you want out of it? Dinner. If you must know, I did it for a business deal. What? You did it for a business deal? Going out with her? I don't get it. Yeah, I sometimes do business with her father. Yeah, she told us that. She mentioned that it might be a good idea that I date her, so I. I called her up, and I took her on the best date of her life. Oh, so you're telling me that you used her as a stepping stone in your little effing career? I'm not saying that, no. But I will tell you that two days later, I close the deal. You are? Oh, my. So once the money comes. So you took her out just to close a deal with her father? Not just to close A deal. We had a nice time. She had a nice time. I'm sure wasn't a wasted night in her life. Yes, it was. You were texting her afterwards, and you couldn't wait to see her again. You played with her emotions. You totally let her on. You're a total. Haha! Jeez, Brooke. Look, you can call me names all you want, but I'm just being honest with you guys. You called me, and I'm the one closing multimillion dollar deals on a regular basis. Whoa. Yeah, but you didn't have to. Like, I mean, couldn't you just go, yeah, sure, I'll go out with your daughter and take her on a regular date and not try to be super romantic about it. So I should take her on a date? Hey, I don't know. Maybe you just don't use his daughter at all, and you're actually a good businessman, and you make a deal without having to use somebody's daughter in the process of it. Listen, sweetheart, in business, you do whatever you need to do to close the deal, okay? I close the deal the day that you're doing things like that. You can come talk to me, but. Oh, my goodness.

The guy who made a one million dollar half court shot but never got paid. This is Don Calhoun, and in 1993 he was selected out of six million contestants to shoot the half court shot at the Chicago Bulls stadium. And beyond belief, he actually made the shot from over 80 feet away from the hoop. The whole Chicago Bulls team then hugged and congratulated him, even Michael Jordan. But the insurance company who backed the event had no intent that he would make the shot, therefore trying to find an excuse not to pay Dawn. They then went back to their rules of the event and found a violation. One of the rules was that the person shooting could not have played organized basketball in the last five years, and three years prior don was involved in an intramural league at a recreational facility. When word spread that the insurance company wasn't going to pay don, fans were outraged and pressured the Bulls to try and get don his money. So out of fear for their business, the insurance company agreed to pay him $50,000 every year for the next 20 years. As of today, Dawn is now retired and is helping his four kids get into college with the prize money he won 30 years prior.

You see, every time Jeffrey was depositing his stolen coins, he would not only use the bank branch right near his parking meters, he would also still even be wearing his parking uniform. But somehow these bank workers never ask questions. And it was only five years later that they finally became suspicious about his uniform and reported him to the police.

Before we even got into the park, it cost me $30 just for parking. And even being a Florida resident, tickets for a family of five with one child under 10 was still $974. The rest of the family decided they want to go to dinner at Downtown Disney Springs. This place was my literal hell. Totaling two hundred and forty five dollars, twenty seven cents. The grand total for our day was one thousand three hundred ninety one dollars, ninety one cents. I kind of had a feeling it would go viral. It's very relatable. It's family friendly. They want you to never leave the park. They want you there for five days and they want you to drop 10 grand. A shocked Florida dad just exposed the outrageous price tag for taking his family of five to Disney World for just one day, an eye popping $1,400. Before this family even stepped foot inside the park, they had to shell out $30 just for parking. But that was nothing compared to the shocking ticket prices. A mind blowing $974 for just five people. Simple refreshments like three ice creams and two water bottles cost them nearly $30.

There's something special in their wheels. Here's how it works. You fill up your cart and head to a check stand. And when they go through the check lane, there's a deactivators in each check lane and through self checkout and it will deactivate that from locking so you can leave the store with these. So if you don't go through a check stand, the cart will lock at the entryway. The system is designed to prevent shoplifters from loading up a cart then heading out the doors without paying. It's tough for store security to detain someone inside the store suspected of shoplifting when the thief could always say they were planning to pay. It does help prevent a loss in our stores, definitely. We did see some people who paid. Sorry about that. I didn't steal anything. Oh, no. It just locks up after a certain amount of time. But their carts locked as they try to leave. Store security has a quick release device to help them on their way. There are some technical bugs are working out with the carts. It does need to be right in front of the sensor for about 30 seconds, which is about the time it takes to unload a shopping cart. The carts do have signs to explain the locking devices.

Having a mother who got pregnant at 18 meant I grew up with a best friend who happened to look like a supermodel and had the relationship ethics of a praying mantis. When I started dating my first boyfriend, Ezra, I was super excited to introduce him to my mother. But when I brought him home, mom opened the door wearing her tightest red dress and introduced herself as my sister. Then she laughed when I corrected it to mother and spent the entire dinner flirting with Ezra. I thought whatever and just I added to chalk it out to her being weird. But then two days later, Ezra texted me saying, sorry, I slept with your mother. It felt like all the energy from my body had disappeared. When I confronted my mom, she said it was just a one time mistake and would never happen again. So I believed her. Two years later, I started dating Stefan from my office. When I brought him to my cousin's wedding, mom monopolized him all night with her hand on his knee. She laughed when I told her to stop and said she was just having fun. So once again, I let it go and once again, she stole him. On our anniversary, I came home early with champagne in my hands but found my mother in our bed sitting on top of Stefan. Oh, honey. I was just testing him for you. Wouldn't you rather know now than after marriage, she said, and I ran away. I moved two hours away and became scared of dating. But that's when I met Danny. He drew hearts in my latte foam and left poetry on my pillow every Sunday morning. We built a quiet life in our tiny apartment where my mother had never set foot. I posted no couple photos and made Danny promise to keep our relationship off social media. But at our anniversary dinner, everything collapsed. My mother walked through the door and took Danny's hand before I could warn him. Hello, son, I'm the mom, the premium version of my daughter. That night, I shook in bed while Danny promised nothing would happen. Then two months later, I came home early from work and my heart dropped. My mother's car was in our driveway. I walked inside with heavy footsteps and heard them both through our bedroom door. She'll never love you like I can, Danny. The bed creaked rhythmically while he moaned her name. I slammed against the door until wood slanted and barged inside. They didn't even scramble apart. They froze mid act, tangled in our sheets. She pulled her Yankee's Jersey down to cover herself while Danny scrambled for a pillow. This isn't what it looks like, Danny said. My mother just smiled, honey, you should thank me. Better you find out now than after marriage. Something inside me shattered. Completely. I turned and walked out as Danny called my name, my mother's laughter following me down the stairs. I couldn't eat for days and lived on my bathroom floor until my best friend found me and dragged me to her therapy group, where a woman passed around photos of a guy named Callahan, someone who had destroyed her elderly mother through romance fraud that night.

I think it might be defective or something. this is the maximum plump from the Too Faced lip injection collection, so it's not surprising that it's stung. Oh, really? So any lip plumper is gonna sting your lips just a little bit so that they swell up and get a nice little plump? Some people are more sensitive to it than others. Oh. Are there any lip plumpers that don't sting at all? If you want your lips to get plumped up, then unfortunately, it's going to have to sting at least a little bit. Yeah, I don't like the feeling of stinging in my lips at all. Is there a way that I can get that look of a plump without that sting? Yeah, I'm not particularly a fan of the sting of lip plumpers either. So to give the illusion of a plumper lip, I like to overdraw my lips a little bit, and then I just put a shiny gloss on top. Okay, I'll definitely try that. Thank you so much for your help.

My roommate Ben was obsessed with this Instagram model named Grace who worked at our local coffee shop. For three months, he'd go there daily, order expensive drinks and stare at her like a creep. He practiced conversations in our dorm mirror but never spoke to her beyond medium latte, please. It was honestly painful to watch. This dude was spending his entire food budget on overpriced coffee just to be in the same room as this girl who probably didn't even know his name. One day, Ben discovered Grace was best friends with this bigger girl named Megan who also worked there. Ben came running back with his brilliant plan. Bro, you need to ask Megan out, he said, pacing our tiny room like a maniac. If you date her friend, I'll have an automatic in with Grace. Girl code, wingman duties, double dates. It's perfect. I stared at him like he'd lost his mind. Dude, that's messed up. I'm not using some random girl just so you can get a date. But Ben reminded me he'd been helping me pack as calculus all semester. Without his tutoring, I'd probably fail and lose my scholarship. He also offered to cover utilities for two months. I felt absolutely terrible, but I was broke and desperate. The next day, I walked into that coffee shop with my stomach in knots. Megan was working the register and when she saw me approach She smiled this genuine, warm smile that immediately made me feel like garbage about what I was doing. Hey, you're Ben's friend, right? She said. Already starting to make my usual order. I'm Megan. I've actually noticed you guys coming in here a lot. My heart sank. She been paying attention to me and here I was about to manipulate her feelings for my roommate's benefit. But I was already committed. So I took a deep breath and asked, would you maybe wanna grab dinner sometime, just the two of us? Her entire face lit up like Christmas morning. Really? I mean, yes, I'd love that. I was actually hoping you'd ask. We exchange numbers and I scheduled our date for that Friday night. I plan to suffer through one awkward dinner, get some Intel about Grace for Ben, and then politely fade away. Friday came and I picked Megan up from her apartment. She'd put on this beautiful blue dress and done her hair all nice and I felt like the biggest piece of trash on the planet. We went to this little Italian place near campus. It had decent prices and dim lighting. But something unexpected happened during dinner. Megan started telling me about her veterinary medicine studies and her passion for animals was infectious. She volunteered at a local animal rescue and had these incredible stories about nursing sick puppies back to health and helping traumatize cats learn to trust humans again. Then she started talking about Her family, how she was the first person in her family to go to college, working two jobs to pay tuition while maintaining a 3.8 GPA. She was funny, too, making jokes about terrible customers at the coffee shop and doing spot on impressions of our professors. By the time dessert arrived, I had completely forgotten about.

Not only was the plane in the Pacific Ocean and it was running out of fuel, but what's worse, when he took out his navigational instrument to calculate the coordinates, he realized he was too far off course. But the captain didn't dare tell his two teammates behind him. He had to contact the base tower with his communications officer to ask for help. Unexpectedly, he heard the voice of the Japanese. Frightened, they turned off their radios and switched to Morse code. Now, they had to reduce the weight of the plane as much as possible before they ran out of fuel. So the bombardiers dropped all their bombs in the Pacific. Then the captain looked for coordinates and turned around. After 10 minutes in the air, they tried to retransmit the radio, but there was no answer. They're about to run out of fuel. The captain had to arrange for everyone to take their survival kits and make an emergency landing in the Pacific Ocean. Although the plane managed to land on the surface of the sea, but the strong impact caused serious damage inside the cabin. The sea was pouring in. The captain pushed open the door and escaped immediately. Then he opened the rescue valve to flush the air, but Will's seat belt was stuck.

The boy was delighted to see the magical airplane, so when his babysitter wasn't looking, he brought over a ladder. Then the boy climbed onto the roof with the airplane, hoping it could take him flying freely. Just then, his mother appeared in time and pulled the boy down, but the airplane fell as a result. Little did they know danger was slowly approaching them. To prevent her son from doing anything dangerous again, the mother returned to the room and locked the airplane away. No matter how much the boy cried and fussed, his mother refused to take it out. While they were still arguing, something strange happened. The airplane that had been locked in the room suddenly burst through the window and began destroying things throughout the room. The next second, the plane emitted a red light toward the mother. Terrified by this sight, the mother screamed in fear. The frightened boy ran over and hugged his mother. Strangely, though, the airplane gradually quieted down and slowly flew back to the ground. Seeing his mother was scared, the boy took the airplane back to his room. To uncover the airplane secret, the mother called her friend Jack and secretly took the airplane away for research. After scanning the airplane with machinery, they discovered there were no electronic components inside. They were very puzzled by this. They then placed the airplane under a Hydraulic press.

As soon as she went outdoors, she would become weak and dizzy. She would even wet herself. To find out where the woman kept her money, the robbers threw her outside. A robber held her and demanded to know where the money was. Unable to bear the suffering, she finally revealed the location. Only then did the robber carry her back inside. Then the two robbers immediately went to the basement. But strangely, the basement door wouldn't open no matter what. Meanwhile, the other robber carried the woman to a room. Looking at the fragile woman before him, he had evil intentions. This crucial moment, fortunately, a man rushed in and pulled the robber away. This man was the delivery person who brought her food every day. She took this opportunity to immediately run outside and hide in the bathroom. The robber chased after her, unaware this would be his most regrettable decision. Just as the woman was still gathering her thoughts, the robber suddenly burst through the door, cornering the woman. Before the robber could finish speaking, she slashed his throat. The robber fell in disbelief. Now the woman was coldly different, as if she had become another person. What they didn't know was that their nightmare was just beginning. The robbers discovered a microphone in a drawer. By the time they realized something was wrong, it was too late.

Elon Musk, the world's richest man and constant headline machine, had promised to launch his America Party to blow up the two party system. But according to new reports, he's putting that dream on ice for one reason keeping ties with Republicans, especially Vice President J D. Vance. Here's the deal. Musk told people close to him that forming a new party would damage his relationship with Vance, who many believe will carry Trump's MAGA torch into 2028. Instead of competing, Musk is now hinting at something else becoming Vance's biggest backer. Remember, this is the same guy who poured nearly $300 million into G O P. Campaigns in 2024, basically bankrolling Trump's comeback. But Musk isn't completely out of the game. Sources say he's still holding the America Party card in his back pocket, waiting to see how the 2026 midterms play out. If the political winds shift, he could revive it. If not, expect Musk to play kingmaker with his billions. So here's the question. Is Musk playing 4D chess by aligning with JD Vance, or is he too scared to shake the system like he promised? Let me know what you think in the comments.

Christine Knowm just announced that the entire southern border wall will be coated in black paint at Trump's personal request. The logic is straightforward black paint heats up faster under the desert sun, so anyone trying to scale the steel barrier will think twice when it's scorching hot to the touch, Noah insisted. The wall is already almost impossible to climb since it's tall and buried deep underground. Adding paint turns it into something closer to a furnace. The project is folded into the 46.5 billion one big Beautiful Bill Act, which also funds 700 more miles of barrier across the U S Mexico line. D H S. Says the new coding isn't only about deterrence. It's also supposed to keep the steel from rusting, extending the wall's life. Supporters argue it's clever engineering with psychological impact. Critics blasted as political theater, questioning whether a coat of paint will really stop desperate migrants to make things murkier. DHS won't say how much the repainting will cost, claiming it could affect future bids. That silence fuels suspicions taxpayers could be footing an oversized Bill. So tell me, smart security move or just burning money in the desert sun? Sound off.

Stop scrolling. New Politico Citron polling reveals that Gavin Newsom leads Kamala Harris among California Democrats for the 2028 presidential primary 25% to 19%. The explanation, Newsom is everywhere, opposing Trump's immigration raids, challenging gerrymandering in Texas and making daily headlines. Harris has been quieter since her loss to Trump and recently opted out of the California governor race. Voter enthusiasm is telling, 75% are excited for Newsom versus 67% for Harris. Behind them, Buttegi, eg, AOC and others are trailing far behind. California clearly favors candidates who stay in the spotlight, yet insiders have different priorities. Only 14% of policy influencers back Newsom and 2% support Harris. They're focused on who could actually win nationally against Republicans like JD. Vance, not just who's popular locally. So here's the debate. Will Newsom's momentum in California translate to a national win or is Harris still the name with the most recognition for 2028? Let us know in the comments.

I'm sorry to tell you, but this has been a known fact. It is literally nothing new. There has been countless pieces of evidence to support this. I guess it just took one Youtuber quitting to trigger this situation. Honestly it is really funny to see everybody coming together to ratio the fuck out of Roblox. Like look at the like to comment ratio. On top of that, the fuck is police department told the Roblox CEO to step down or quit. This is top 10 funniest things I have seen this year. Loki. Imagine being so hated even the government says to quit. Roblox has made an official reply to this drama. It's so full of bullshit that I'm not even gonna talk about it.

Having a mother who got pregnant at 18 meant I grew up with a best friend who happened to look like a supermodel and had the relationship ethics of a praying mantis. When I started dating my first boyfriend, Ezra, I was super excited to introduce him my mother. But when I brought him home, mom opened the door wearing her tightest red dress and introduced herself as my sister. Then she laughed when I corrected it to mother and spent the entire dinner flirting with Ezra. I thought whatever and decide to talk it out to her being weird. But then two days later, Ezra texted me saying, sorry, I slept with your mother. It felt like all the energy from my body had disappeared. When I confronted my mom, she said it was just a one time mistake and would never happen again. So I believed her. Two years later, I started dating Stefan from my office. When I brought him to my cousin's wedding, mom monopolized him all night with her hand on his knee. She laughed when I told her to stop and said she was just having fun. So once again, I let it go and once again, she stole him. On our firstly, I came home early with champagne in my hands but found my mother in our bed sitting on top of Stefan. Oh, honey, I was just Testing him for you. Wouldn't you rather know now than after marriage, she said, and I ran away. I moved two hours away and became scared of dating. But that's when I met Danny. He drew hearts in my latte foam and left poetry on my pillow every Sunday morning. We built a quiet life in our tiny apartment where my mother had never set foot. I posted no couple photos and made Danny. I promised to keep our relationship off social media. But at our anniversary dinner, everything collapsed. My mother walked through the door and took Danny's hand before I could warn him. Hello, son, I'm the mom, the premium version of my daughter. That night, I shook in bed while Danny promised nothing would happen. Then two months later, I came home early from work and my heart dropped. My mother's car was in our driveway. I walked inside with heavy footsteps and heard them both through our bedroom door. She'll never love you like I can, Danny. The bed creaked rhythmically while he moaned her name. I slammed against the door until wood splintered and barged in. They didn't even scramble apart. They froze mid act, tangled in our sheets. She pulled his Yankees Jersey down to cover herself while Danny scrambled for a pillow. This isn't what it looks like, Danny said. My mother just smiled, honey, you should thank me. Better you find out now than after marriage. Something inside me shattered completely. I Turned and walked out as Danny called my name, my mother's laughter following me down the stairs. I couldn't eat for days and lived on my bathroom floor until my best friend found me and dragged me to her therapy group, where a woman passed around photos of a guy named Callahan, someone who had destroyed her elderly mother through romance fraud that night.

I was in Mister Aneta's history class when the announcement came over the intercom. Code red! Code red! This is not a drill. Everyone froze. We practiced this 100 times. Lock the door. Turn off the lights. Hide in the corner. Mister Wienetta immediately jumped up and reached for the door lock. Then Vice Principal Medina's voice boomed through the speaker. False alarm, everyone. Some prankster called in a fake threat. Continue with your lessons. Do not lock your doors. I repeat, do not initiate lockdown procedures. Mister Wienetta hesitated with his hand on the lock. My friend Maddie whispered from her desk. But I said, Code Red! That's the real signal. Mister Arnetta looked confused. The VP says it's fake, though. Then we heard it. Footsteps running down the hallway. Not walking. Running hard and fast. Like someone was being chased. Mister Medina's voice came back on. Teachers. I said, continue teaching. Any classroom that locks their door will have their teacher written up for insubordination. Mister Arnetta slowly backed away from the door. He looked scared, but sat back his desk. Everyone stay calm. Let's continue with the lesson. Sweat was dripping from his forehead and nobody could focus. The running footsteps kept happening. First on our floor, then above us, and back again. I put pulled out my phone and opened our school's parent Facebook group. My mom had posted that police were surrounding the School. They told us someone called about a weapon. She spammed my phone, saying she loves me. My hands started shaking. I showed Maddie the post. Her face went white. She raised her hand. Mister Renata, my mom says the police are outside. Mister Renata walked to the window and peeked through the blinds. He gasped loudly. There were 6 police cars in the parking lot. Mister Medina came on again. Students, ignore any social media posts. This is a routine false alarm. Any student caught on their phone will receive immediate suspension. Any teacher who initiates lockdown will be terminated. I saw Mister Aneta's jaw clench. We could hear doors slamming somewhere in the building. Not closing, slamming. Like someone was checking rooms. Then we heard something that made everyone freeze. The fire exit at the end of our hallway opened and slammed shut. Someone was on our floor. Maddie grabbed my arm so tight it hurt. The footsteps were getting closer, classroom by classroom. Mr. Grenada stood up and walked toward the door again. But he stopped. He looked at us and at the door. And back at us. The footsteps stopped right outside our room. That's when Pete, the quiet kid who never talked, he grabbed his desk and started dragging it toward the door. Mr. Anetta, help me now! Mr. Anetta snapped out of it. What are you doing? Pete didn't stop. My dad's a cop. He said if we ever hear Code Red, we lock Down! No matter what anyone says, even the principal. The doorknob started to turn. Everyone moved at once. Kids grabbed desks and chairs and shoved them against the door. Mr. Anetta finally joined us. Lights! Someone get the lights! Maddie, hit the switch. We pushed everything we could find against that door. The person outside pushed hard. The door opened a crack, but hit our barricade. They put harder. Mr. Medina's voice screamed through the intercom. Which classroom is refusing to follow directions? You will all be expelled. But we didn't care about his threats anymore. The person outside kicked the door. The whole barricade shook. Some girls started crying. Pete pointed to the back corner. Everyone get down! Stay quiet! We huddled together in the darkness. The kicking got more violent. And suddenly it stopped. We heard the footsteps. Move to the next class.

So I left. I was looking at credit card statements last month when my fiance Bianca was packing for another girl's trip, her fourth this year. We need to talk about these trips. I said. This Miami one will cost at least $3,000. That's 12,000 this year alone. She rolled her eyes. I work hard. I deserve fun. The thing was I covered all our expenses, rent, utilities, groceries, her car payment. Her entire salary was play money. You spend your whole income on trips while I cover everything else. I pointed out my trips are non negotiable. She said if you don't like it, then leave. She said it so casually like our five year relationship meant nothing. Fine. I said I'll leave. She laughed over a girl's trip? Seriously? Over you telling me to leave rather than discuss our finances like adults. Yeah. She grabbed her suitcase from Miami without even saying goodbye. I called my brother. Still have that empty room, started packing immediately. While packing, found receipts from her Vegas trip, bottle service, VIP sections and a five hundred dollar receipt from a men's clothing store. Who buys men's clothes on a girl's trip. Next morning, removed her as authorized user on my credit cards. By Saturday, 47 missed calls from her friends in Miami. Her card got declined. Sunday she texted, my cards are maxed. I'm stranded. Use your own cards. I replied That's financial abuse. This is me leaving like you suggested. Monday. I went to our apartment early, packed all my stuff, took everything I bought, TV, gaming console, coffee maker, even the good shower head. Left her designer clothes and makeup. Left a note as suggested, I've left rents paid through months end. After that, it's your responsibility. Also left printouts showing $47,000 spent on Girls trip. So over 3 years, almost a house down payment. She exploded by a text, you took the TV. Are you 12? This is theft. Then pivoted to, please let's talk. I'm sorry. Showed up at my office, had security escort her out. Posted on Instagram about toxic men who can't handle independent women. Comments weren't what she expected. Independent? Don't you live in his apartment? Maybe he got tired of funding your lifestyle. She deleted it within an hour. Week later, she emailed, I can't afford the apartment. My cards are maxed. Parents think I'm irresponsible. Please come home. I'll cancel the next trip. I responded, you were honest about wanting a lifestyle I can't support. We're just not compatible. Engagements off. Then things got interesting. Gay best friend Perry slid into my DMS. Heard about you and be, if you need to talk, I'm here. Two days later, Bianca posted a romantic dinner photo with hearts. My buddy saw them at a couple's spa making out. Perry wasn't gay. He was her side piece. The men's clothes from Vegas suddenly made sense. She threw a party at the apartment, violated the lease. Landlord called me about noise complaints, gave her 48 hours to vacate. She trashed the place, broken bottles, carpet stains, cigarette burn.

My eight year old son has always had one dream. He wanted to adopt a puppy. Not just any puppy, but one that needed love the most. So for his birthday this year, my husband and I surprised him with a visit to the local animal shelter. The second we stepped inside, he was scanning every kennel like it was the most important vision of his life. Then he stopped in front of one. In the far back of the room, lying completely still, was a Pitbull named Frank. Frank didn't even lift his head when we approached. He had this deep, almost defeated frown on his face that made you feel it in your chest. His eyes didn't sparkle like the other dogs. He just stared at the floor like he was waiting for nothing. My son looked up at us and said quietly, he's the one. We asked the shelter staff about Frank, and they warned us immediately. He had been rescued from a home where he was beaten and neglected. He didn't trust people. He rarely ate. He hadn't wagged his tail since the day they brought him in. He was afraid of men, loud noises, sudden movements, pretty much everything. They told us it might take months before he showed any sign of progress. They didn't recommend him for families with children. But our son didn't care. He stood there with his arms crossed and Said he needs someone. I don't care how long it takes. I want him. So we brought Frank home that afternoon. At first, he refused to leave the corner of the living room. He growled at my husband just for walking by. He wouldn't touch his food unless no one was in the. We laid blankets down, brought him toys, sat near him, tried everything we could. But it was our son who finally broke through. Every night, he sat a few feet away from Frank and read to him. Sometimes it was comic books. Sometimes it was school assignments. Sometimes it was just him talking about his day. Every morning before school, he'd put the leash on and take Frank for a walk. Even if Frank just sat there for 20 minutes, refusing to move. Slowly, Frank started to trust him. He let him pet his back one morning. A week later, he let him scratch his ears. A month later, Frank was sleeping on his bed like it was the safest place in the world. The biggest change came one afternoon when I walked in to find

Up until last year, my mom had 2.8 million followers on her family lifestyle channel. The whole internet thought she was this perfect mom with her cute family content. But they had no idea what was really going on behind the camera. See, my mom treated our family like a TV show. She had storylines for us. My little brother Austin was always the golden child. His videos got titles like my son made me breakfast in bed or Austin's First Day of Middle School. Meanwhile, I was the villain in every single video. When I got a C on my math test, she made me sit in front of the camera crying while she filmed. My daughter is failing school. What do I do? When I had a fight with my friend Emma, she turned it into a 3 part series called Teen Drama, how to Handle Difficult friendships. She posted my report cards. She filmed my punishments. Every mistake I made became content. The worst part, Austin got to live normally. His bad moments were never filmed. His tantrums were handled privately. But me, if I so much as rolled my eyes, out came the ring light and camera setup. Last fall, I finally brought home straight A's for the first time ever.

That's when I realized she needed me to fail. She needed me to be the problem child because that's what got views. My pain was literally paying for our house, our cars, our vacations. The breaking point came three months ago. I was having a panic attack after some kids at school found her video about my attitude problems and started bullying me about it. I was hyperventilating in my room when she burst in with her phone. Perfect, she said, starting to record. This is exactly what I need for the mental health awareness series. Can you cry a little louder and face the camera more? I couldn't believe it. I was having a breakdown and she wanted me to perform it better. That night, I decided to film her for once. I hid my phone and recorded her coaching me before a video. Okay, so in this one, you're going to be upset about your curfew. Really sell the add.

Emma came home from school last Tuesday looking all pouty, dropping her backpack with that dramatic thud only 13 year olds can master. What's wrong? I asked, stirring Mac and cheese on the stove like I did every Tuesday. Madison's mom is so cool, she muttered, slumping into a kitchen chair. She lets Madison wear whatever she wants, doesn't make her do chores, and they go shopping together like they're best friends. She even bought Madison a crop top yesterday. Emma crossed her arms. I wish you were more like her instead of being so strict about everything. That hit me weird. I've been raising Emma alone since her dad left when she was seven, working my butt off as a bank teller to keep us afloat. I thought I was doing okay, making sure she ate vegetables at a bedtime, did her homework. But maybe I was being too uptight. You know what? I said, turning off the stove. You're right. Let's go shopping right now. Emma's face lit up like Christmas morning. Really? Can we go to the mall where Madison shops? Two hours later, we were walking through target with a cart full of stuff I never would have bought before. Crop tops, makeup, a phone case with fake diamonds, energy drinks, even some of those expensive face masks she'd been begging for. When Emma asked if she Could get her ears pierced at the kiosk. I said yes before my brain could catch up. That weekend, I let her have friends over without hovering. I ordered pizza instead of making them eat carrot sticks. When they wanted to watch some rated R movie on Netflix, I figured, why not? When Emma asked if she could walk to the convenience store with Madison at 9 p m, I handed her 20 bucks. The next week, Emma started staying out later. Madison's mom lets her stay out until 11 on school nights. She'd text me at 10:30. I text back okay, even though my stomach felt twisted up then.

I was walking down the street when these two girls I've never seen before called my name. Ryan. This is super weird, but our best friend's baby shower is happening right now. Can you please pretend to be her boyfriend and the father? I did a double take. They looked so desperate. Her ex is insane. He tried to burn their house down while she was in. He's gonna show up at some point and we need someone who can scare him off. I'm 6 feet 4 inches and apparently look like I eat nails for breakfast. So I get why they picked me, but this was insane. How do you even know my name? Your gym bag, one said, pointing at the tag. Please, he said he's coming at three PM to reclaim what's his. It's 2:15. Against every logical thought, I followed them into this house covered in pink balloons and baby girl band. The living room was packed with women who all turned to stare at me. Then I saw her, Becky from my comparative lit class sophomore year, the girl I'd spent an entire semester trying to work up the courage to talk, talk to. Now eight months pregnant, looking exhausted, it seemed like the worst joke the universe has ever played. Everyone, this is Ryan. The girls announced the father. Becky's eyes went wide recognizing me, but she played along. Hey, babe. He said weakly. Her friend pulled me aside. Richard's been sending videos all morning. He's unhinged. Just stand there and look protective until he shows up and leaves. I stood by Becky's chair while she opened presents. The party tried to feel normal, but everyone was tense. Her phone buzzed. She showed me a video from Richard on my way to get what's mine. Hope you didn't think you could replace me. This is the sixth one today, Becky whispered an older woman, maybe an aunt, quietly to another guest. Remember when Richard threw that bottle at her head at Christmas? Becky's mom approached me. Thank you for doing this. Last time he showed up somewhere, he broke her friend's nose for interfering. Another video came through at 2:30. Richard in his truck. Tell everyone to clear out unless they want problems. The room got quieter. People kept glancing at the windows. At 2:40, another text. Nice pink decorations. Almost there. A friend mentioned he knows which house he's probably driving by. Becky tried to focus on opening a baby onesie. Her hands were shaking. Last time he came to a party, someone whispered. Four people went to the er. At 2:50, Becky's phone rang. She put it on speak.

He's the love of my life. You're just a pathetic substitute keeping his bed warm. When I didn't react, she laughed and said, you're so pathetic, you won't even fight for me. I didn't say anything because, honestly, I was relieved. See, I've been trying to figure out how to break up with Cassandra for months. She was gorgeous, sure, but completely exhausting. Everything was drama. Her job, her family, her friends. Even ordering coffee became this elaborate. I felt like I was dating a tornado. That looked really good in Instagram photos. The wedding planning had been a nightmare. Cassandra wanted everything perfect, which meant nothing was ever good enough. She'd fired three different vendors for not understanding her vision. She made our photographer reshoot our engagement photos four times because her smile didn't look authentic enough in the originals. She spent two hours at cake tape things, complaining that vanilla was too basic, but chocolate was too predictable. But we'd already sent 200 wedding invitations, already put $15,000 in deposits down on the venue, catering, flowers. My parents had flown in from Ohio twice for planning meetings and absolutely adored her. My mom kept talking about what beautiful grandchildren we'd have and had already started shopping for grandmother of the groom dresses. Breaking up would have been this whole nightmare of explanations, returned gifts, awkward conversations with vendors, disappointed family members asking What went wrong? I was basically trapped by logistics and other people's expectations. So when Cassandra drunkenly confessed at her sister's birthday party that she was using me as a placeholder boyfriend, I just nodded and said, okay. She expected me to yell to beg to make some dramatic scene. Instead, I calmly asked, when's he getting out? March, she slurred, looking completely confused by my reaction. Perfect. That gives us three months to play.

Like, are you describing a grown woman or a literal toddler? Because what you're saying doesn't sound like a type. It sounds like a problem. And it's the hypocrisy for me. Like men can have back hair, chest hair, hairy legs, body odor and such, but let a woman have a little armpit hair or normal pigmentation and suddenly she's unhygienic and disgusting. why do these men even have these kinds of preferences to begin with? Like every day I gotta wake up and suddenly overthink my body again because some dusty man on the internet said, Ew, pepperoni nipples, pepperoni nipples. Like what the fuck does that even mean? And what's crazy to me is that half the time these men don't even look like anything special. They out here with their crusty ass lips, beard, dandruff, a patchy mustache and zero skincare routine, and yet they're out here with the audacity to request their girl to look like an airbrushed anime character in real life.

Why is no experience a turn On. That's a power dynamic thing. You want someone who doesn't know better so she can't clock your mediocrity.

Not toys or video games like other kids, but actual money. She'd sit at the kitchen counter counting her allowance over and over, organizing it by denomination, even researching investment strategies on my laptop. I thought it was just a phase until I came home from work one Thursday to find her sitting at our dining room table with a stack of printed papers spread out everywhere. I walked closer and couldn't believe what I was seeing. Job applications. Like, actual job applications from every business in town. Burger King, Target, CVS, even the local nursing home called Sunset Manor. She had them all filled out in her careful 10 year old handwriting. When I asked what she was doing, she looked up at me with the most serious expression and said, dad, I need to start building my credit score now so I can retire by 40. I almost choked on my coffee. This kid was 10 years old talking about credit scores and retirement plans. I figured she'd gotten the idea from some YouTube video, so I just laughed it off and told her to clean up her mess before dinner. But then two days later, our landline rang. I picked up, and this woman's voice said, hi, is this the contact number for Zoe Williams? I'm calling from Sunset Manor about her application for assistant to the director of nursing. My blood went cold. I looked over at Zoe, who was watching cartoons on the couch, acting like nothing happened. I told the woman there must be some mistake, but she kept talking. Oh, no. We received her application in the mail yesterday. It was quite impressive, actually. She wrote that

The lawyer couldn't stop smiling. When my grandmother passed last year, she left me her house. Nothing fancy, just a two bedroom place in a decent neighborhood that she'd lived in for 40 years. My husband Rick was thrilled. He immediately started talking about selling it and using the money for his motorcycle collection. I wanted to keep it in the family. Rick had this thing where everything had to be his idea. When I suggested we could rent it out instead, he rolled his eyes and said I didn't understand money. When I mentioned maybe keeping it for future kids, he laughed and said kids were expensive enough without keeping useless property around. Three months later, he filed for divorce out of nowhere. Apparently, he'd been seeing his coworker Jessica for six months. Same Jessica who helped plan my birthday party and kept texting me about girl trips we should take together. Rick moved out on a Tuesday. By Friday, his lawyer was already demanding half of everything, including the house I inherited. His argument was that we were married when I got it, so it counted as marital property. I was devastated. That house meant everything to me. My grandmother taught me to bake in that kitchen. I had my first sleepover in the back bedroom. My lawyer, Missus Chen, scheduled a meeting to go over Rick's demands. She was this tiny Asian woman who wore huge glasses. And spoke really quietly. When she read through Rick's paperwork, she got this weird expression on her face, like she was trying not to laugh. Your husband wants half the house, he said. But did you tell him about the condition your grandmother put in her will? I had no idea what she meant. Missus Chen pulled out my grandmother's will and pointed to a paragraph I'd never really read carefully. Apparently, my grandmother was way smarter than any of us realized. Will said I could inherit the house, but only if I was still married to my first husband when she died. If I got divorced within five years of inheriting it, the house would go directly to my cousin Jake in California. No exceptions. No splitting it, no selling it. My grandmother had met Rick exactly twice. Both times, he spent the entire visit on his phone. Or complaining about her old person smell. She clearly saw right through him.

My ex husband, Tyler, had been caught stealing money from his job and tried to pin it all on me with fake papers and forged signatures. The whole thing was insane. For over a year, cops were at my house. My bank accounts got frozen and people I thought were friends basically ghosted me. Meanwhile, Tyler's walking around like he's some misunderstood victim. And he even brought his new girlfriend to court. Yeah, the same girl he was cheating on me with while I was home with our twin boys. The courtroom was packed. Tyler had his whole family there supporting him. I just had my sister Kim and my lawyer. The process, Peter had just finished showing all the evidence that proved Tyler not only forged my name on loan papers, but also used our kids Social Security numbers to open fake credit cards. Like, who is that to their own children? When the judge asked Tyler if he wanted to say anything, of course, he stood up and gave this whole sob story about being a devoted father and husband who was just trying to provide for his family. He actually had the nerve to say that I had manipulated the situation and that everyone in the courtroom knew. I wasn't the innocent person I was pretending to be. When he sat down, he had this smug little smile on his face like he just won an Oscar. Then the judge looked right at me and asked if I wanted to say anything before the final decision. I hadn't planned on speaking at all, but something inside me just snapped. Maybe it was seeing his girlfriend sitting there in the front row.

Like, no, Emily, you do not have four different mental disorders just because you saw a TikTok that said if you breathe sometimes and also blink, you might have ADHD. Congratulations, that's called being a human. Look, I get it. Mental health awareness is hella important. It's amazing that people are talking about it more openly now. But here's the problem scrolling through hashtags at 2:00am is not the same thing as a professional evaluation. Google is not your therapist. ID Labs tests are not your psychiatrist. And that one influencer who talks about their symptoms in a story time? Definitely not a doctor. When everyone just casually slaps a label on themselves, it waters down the real struggles people actually face. Like someone living with legit OCD is out here battling life every day and then some dude is like oh my god I'm so OCD I color code my closet. No, you're not OCD. You're just organized my guy. And even with depression, just because you're feeling a little sad one week does not mean you have depression. Unless you're diagnosed, I don't wanna hear it. You're free to self pity in private, but self diagnosing is probably one of the most selfish and attention seeking things you can do. Faith out.

My dad found out mom cheated when I came out with the wrong color eyes. Green like the neighbors. The whole family had brown eyes for three generations. And there I was, this green eyed proof of Mom's mistake with Mister Garrett from two houses down. Dad made her take a DNA test when I was 6 months old. He framed the results and hung them in the kitchen right where everyone who visited could see, not the biological father in bold letters. He stayed for appearances. That's what he told people at church, at work, at family gatherings. He'd say it right in front of me like I wasn't even there. I grew up without a name in my own house. Called me it that or the bastard when mom wasn't around. When she was, he just wouldn't speak to me at all. Seventeen years of silence. He talked through mom like I was deaf. Tell it dinner's ready, ask it to move its car. Christmas was the worst. He'd buy mom expensive jewelry, lavish gifts for me. He'd leave a twenty dollar Bill on the counter with a sticky note for the bastard. Every birthday, same thing. Twenty dollars, same note. I kept them all in a shoebox under my bed. The garrets moved away when I was seven. The night before they left, dad made me watch from the window as he spray painted Home Wrecker on Mr Garrett's Driveway made me stand there for the whole thing. This is what happens to families because of you, he said. I was 7 years old. At school events, he'd show up just to make a point. Sat in the back at my middle school graduation with a newspaper held up in front of my face. They called my name. He didn't lower it. At parent teacher conferences, he'd introduce himself as the cuckolded husband and explain my real parentage to my teachers. By high school, I stopped telling him about events. When I was 14, I needed glasses. Mom was at work, so dad had to take me. He told the optometrist loud enough for the whole waiting room to hear that I probably needed them because bad genetics from god knows where. When we got to the car, he made me sit in the back. I don't want people thinking you're mine, he said. The worst happened when I was 15. I've been saving money from tutoring kids in math, hiding it in my locker at school. Dad found out I had a job and demanded the money for rent. When I refused, he changed the locks on the house. Mom was visiting her sister for the weekend. I slept in the backyard shed for two nights before a neighbor called the cops. Dad, I told them I was a runaway who kept coming back. It took mom coming home early to get me back inside. But here's what Really fucked me up. I found a letter in Dad's desk when I was looking for my birth certificate for my driver's permit. It was from Mr Garrett to dad, dated a month after I was born. A check for $50,000 was paper clipped to it. The letter said it was for Maddie's future and begged dad to use it for my college. The check was never cashed. Instead, dad had written, return to sender, keep your guilt money across it in red Sharpie, $50,000. He'd rather see me struggle than touch money meant to help me. Senior year, I got into my dream college with a scholarship for creative writing. I've done everything myself, applications, essays, fee, favors. I didn't even tell them until the acceptance letter came. I waited until dinner, put the letter next to Dad's plate. He read it and looked at mom. You're not using my information for financial aid. I don't need it. I said. Mr Garrett's been putting money in an account for me. Mom's been returning his checks, but he kept the account anyway. It's in my name only. He called on my 18th birthday to tell me. Dad stood up so fast his chair fell over. He grabbed the acceptance letter and tore it into pieces. Then he looked at mom, if it goes to that school, you go with it. Mom started crying. Choose he, your husband or your bastard. She chose him. She always chose him. I left that Night with two garbage bags of clothes and my laptop. But not before I did one thing. I found Mr Garrett through Facebook. He lived three states away alone. His wife had left him after the affair came out. He never remarried, never had kids. When I called him.

I stared in shock. What basement? I'm giving birth at the hospital. Oh, honey, Agnes said, reaching across the table to pat my hand. The middle women have been delivering babies at home for five generations. I delivered Brent and his sisters right here in this house. My husband Brent squeezed my shoulder. Mom's delivered over 20 babies for our family. She knows what she's doing. The baby kicked hard against my ribs like it was trying to escape this conversation. We've been living in Brent's childhood home while our house underwent renovations. Not once had anyone mentioned this family tradition. I already have an OB, I said, my voice shaking. We've been planning a hospital birth. I'm high risk because of my blood pressure. Agnes waved her hand dismissively. Hospitals are where people go to die. Your own mother died giving birth in one of those places. The words hit me like a physical blow. My mother had died from complications during my birth. Red followed me to our bedroom later that night. I was shoving clothes into my overnight bag when he grabbed my wrist. You're overreacting, he said. This is how my family does things. I'm not giving birth in some basement room with your mother playing doctor. His face hardened in a way I've never seen before. If you can't respect our Traditions. Then maybe this marriage was a mistake. I froze. You're threatening divorce? Because I want actual medical care. He showed me our prenup clause 15. In case of divorce due to irreconcilable differences about family values, you forfeit custody rights. My legs went weak. I sank onto the bed. I had no money of my own, no family since my father died last year. Without Brent, I'd lose everything, including my baby. The next weeks became a waking nightmare. Agnes started her preparations, which included drinking foul smelling teas and attending birthing circles with other women from their community. During one session, a woman named Carol pulled me aside. My sister died during one of Agnes home births five years ago. She whispered. They said it was God's will, but she bled out while Agnes refused to call an ambulance. My blood turned to ice that night. I searched online for anything about the Mitchell family. Three women had died during home births in this county over the past 15 years. Agnes name was never mentioned, but the address, this were all in this neighborhood. The headache started the following week. My vision blurred and my feet swelled so badly I couldn't wear shoes. Classic signs of preeclampsia. When I told Agnes, she gave me more herbs and said hospital monitoring would just stress them. Baby. She took my phone the next day, said I was reading too many scary stories online. Brent agreed it was for the best. I waited until Agnes left for her weekly grocery run and snuck to the neighbor's house. I called my old colleague who worked as a labor and delivery nurse. You need to get to a hospital now, she said, after I described my symptoms. You could have a stroke or seizure. The baby could die. I can't, I sobbed. I'll lose custody if I leave. You'll lose your life if you stay. That night at dinner, I showed Brent the information she had texted. For the first time, I saw doubt cross his face. Maybe we should just get you checked, he said quietly, just to be safe. Agnes slammed her hand on the table. Absolutely not. Doubt is what kills mothers and babies. Faith is what saves them. But Brent held firm. We'll go tomorrow morning, just for a quick check up. I never made it to morning. The contraction started at 2:00am, five weeks early. Brent ran for his keys, but Agnes had already taken them. She locked the doors from the inside with keys only she had. This is meant to be, she said. Only as I doubled over in pain. The baby knows when it's time. Brent pounded on the doors, tried to break windows, but Agnes had prepared for this. Security bars on everything. No phones, no landline in our room. She LED me to the basement, where her birthing room waited. Ancient equipment that belonged in a museum. Stained sheets, the smell of old Blood poorly masked by incense. As the contractions intensified, I heard Agnes on an old rotary phone in the corner. Yes, the policy is

This rich kid at my college paid me $500 to take his final exam. For him not cheat. Literally show up as him. See, Brad was this trust fund baby who partied through freshman year while I worked three jobs just to afford ramen. His dad threatened to cut him off if he failed chemistry. And Brad was looking at a solid F. Problem was, Brad and I looked almost identical. Same height, same messy brown hair. Even wore the same thick rimmed glasses. People mixed us up constantly. Which gave Brad a brilliant idea. He cornered me outside the library one Tuesday. Panic in his eyes. You're a science major, right? Just walk in, take the test, walk out. 500 cash. I thought he was insane, but $500 was two months of rent money. My bank account had $47 in it, and my landlord was already leaving threatening notes. So I agreed to the stupidest plan ever. For two weeks, I lived and breathed chemistry. I memorized Brad's textbook, practiced his signature until my hand cramped. Even Learned to write with my left hand, since he was left handed. I studied his social media to copy his mannerisms. The kid barely knew what carbon was, but I was determined to nail this thing. I even got his roommate to help me practice. You need to slouch more, he said. Brad never sits up straight, and he always taps his Pen when he's thinking. The day of the exam, I showed up 20 minutes early, put up trying to look casual. My hands were shaking as I walked into the lecture hall. 200 students, and I was pretending to be someone else. The professor barely glanced at Brad's student ID when I handed it over. Good luck, Bradley, he said without looking up. I found Brad's usual seat in the back corner and sat down. My heart was pounding so loud, I thought everyone could hear it. When they handed out the test, I felt confident. The first 30 questions were exactly what I'd studied. Molecular structures, chemical equations, periodic table stuff. I was flying through it. Then I hit question 47. Describe the quantum mechanical model of electron behavior in metallic bonding under extreme pressure conditions. Stared at the question for five full minutes. This wasn't just advanced chemistry. This was graduate level theoretical stuff. I've never seen anything like it in Brad's textbook. That's when it hit me. Brad had been skipping so much class, he'd missed entire units. Professor had been covering cutting edge research while Brad was passed out in his dorm. I was completely screwed. Panic set in. I looked around the room. Everyone else was writing furiously. Some girl in the front row was already on the back page. I had two choices. Leave half the test blank and guarantee Brad fails, or make something up and hope for partial credit. So I started. Inventing chemistry, I wrote about electrons forming pressure cascades and quantum tunnels under extreme conditions. I made up equations that sounded scientific but were complete nonsense. I described metals becoming molecularly fluid and electrons. He's shifting into higher dimensions. It was like writing science fiction, but with chemical formulas. When I handed in the test, the professor actually looked up from his papers. He flipped through my answers with raised eyebrows. Interesting approach, Bradley, he said slowly.

I'm half Korean, but look completely white. Nobody ever expects me to speak Korean, which has given me some interesting advantages over the years. Last month, I was at this trendy ramen place downtown with my friend Stella. We got seated near the window, and two minutes later, three Korean guys sat down right behind us. College students with designer clothes and expensive watches. Total trust fund kid vibes. Stella launched into her dating drama about her ex texting her at 3:00am. I. I was nodding along when I heard one guy behind us say in Korean, check out that blonde girl in front of us. She's actually really pretty. I kept eating my ramen acting clueless. My mom made sure I was fluent growing up, but I've Learned it's better to let people think I don't understand. You learn a lot when they think you can't hear them. His friend responded, yeah, she's hot, but probably has zero personality. Look how she's dressed. Probably spends her whole paycheck on clothes. I was wearing a target dress and drugstore mascara, but okay. The third guy laughed. White girls like that are all the same. No substance, just Instagram and shopping. But she's never read a book. I have a master's degree in literature, but sure. Stella was still talking about her ex, completely oblivious to the commentary happening behind us. These guys were getting more obnoxious by the Minute look at her trying to use chopsticks! First guy said, giggling. She's holding them like a kindergartener. This is painful to watch. His friends burst out laughing. Should we go help? We could play the help Korean guys teaching the clueless white girl how to eat properly. She'd probably be so grateful for our cultural expertise. Another added, they started planning this elaborate scheme to come over and rescue me from my terrible chopstick technique and use it to hit on me. The condescension was unreal. Stella finished her story and asked what I thought. I told her to block her ex while these guys kept plotting behind us. I bet she doesn't even know what miso is, one said. White girls love that exotic Asian guy thing. This will be easy. We could totally impress her with our food knowledge. Another added. I was getting more annoyed by the second, but decided to wait and see. How are they take this ridiculous plan? They kept going on about how grateful I'd be for their help. She'll probably ask for our numbers after one last. We'll be like her Asian food heroes. The whole thing was so cringe I almost wanted to turn around and end it right there, but I knew waiting would make the payoff even better. About 10 minutes later, they finished their ramen and got up. I could feel them approaching behind me, probably pumping themselves up for their big rescue mission. The first guy, Tapped my shoulder and said in English with this exaggerated hell tone, excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, but I noticed you might be having trouble with your chopsticks. Would you like me to show you an easier way? His friends stood behind him, trying not to smirk. They probably thought they were so smooth. I looked up with my best confused expression.

My physics professor was absolutely psychotic. Doctor Reeves had a PhD from MIT and seemed to hate every student who walked into his quantum mechanics class. Exams were legendary nightmares. The highest score in five years was 34%. Students literally transferred schools to avoid him. Our final exam was worth 60% of our grade. The last question was worth 50 points. Using Schrodinger's equation, calculate the exact probability wave function for an electron in this 47 dimensional quantum system. Then derive the energy eigen values for all possible states. The equation filled two entire pages. Variables I'd never seen before. Mathematical notation that looked like alien hieroglyphics. People were hyperventilating. One guy just walked out crying. Other girl was rocking back and forth, muttering formulas under her breath. I sat there for an hour, completely paralyzed. This was impossible. Even graduate students couldn't all this. My entire physics career was about to end. I could hear people around me frantically scribbling, erasing, having mental breakdowns. The girl next to me was literally pulling her hair out. The room felt like a war zone. Calculators were overheating. People were using every inch of their blue books, writing equations on the margins, on their arms, anywhere they could find space. The desperation was suffocating. Then something clicked. I remembered Doctor Reeves is very first lecture. Physics isn't about memorizing formulas. It's about understanding what's actually possible in our universe. I Stared at the problem again, really studied it line by line, variable by variable. The quantum system they described, it violated the polyexclusion principle. The dimensions were mathematically inconsistent. The boundary conditions contradicted each other. This wasn't just hard, it was physically impossible. But here's the insane part. Buried in the middle of all that chaos was one tiny line that said, assuming standard laboratory conditions. Standard lab conditions meant room temperature, normal pressure, Earth's gravity. But the problem described a system that could only exist in the vacuum of space at absolute zero temperature, while simultaneously requiring conditions found inside a black hole. The temperature requirements alone were contradictory. They needed both absolute zero and billions of degrees simultaneously. The pressure conditions defied thermodynamics. The gravitational fields would tear apart any measuring equipment. I wrote, this quantum system cannot exist under standard laboratory conditions, as it requires mutually exclusive physical environment. The problem violates fundamental laws of physics, including the poly exclusion principle and thermodynamic strengths. Under actual standard laboratory conditions, this system would collapse instantly. I turned in my exam after 90 minutes. The entire class was still

This man brought us all pink peonies on Valentine's Day because he wanted to thank the girls who keep Jade glowing. I snatched her phone before she came back from touching up her lip gloss in the bathroom. The messages went back months. Hotel meet UPS with mirror selfies, late night can't wait to taste you again texts. By the time Jade came back, we'd screenshot everything, but we acted like nothing happened. She was going on and on about her company holiday party next week and suddenly mentioned how Mark couldn't make it because of some unforeseen work emergency. That's when we knew this speech was bringing Dean. The next day, met Mark at this aesthetic little matcha place in Brooklyn. Showed up in his usual hoodie. And that man walked in absolutely confused why we emergency summoned him. Watching his face crumble as he scrolled through the screenshots literally broke my heart. This 6 feet 2 inches golden retriever boy started tearing up right there next to the succulent wall. The way he kept whispering, but I was going to propose at Christmas while staring at his matcha was heartbreaking ASF. I wanted to find Jade and snatch her bald. Here was this king who watched Love Island with us without complaining, who was secretly Pinterest boarding their future wedding, and she was out here acting like a whole ass fool. That's when Eve had that look on her face, the same energy she had when we orchestrated that whole takedown of her toxic ex. Pure mastermind vibes. Mark, my love, do you trust us? He just nodded, too heartbroken to speak. Good. Block out next Saturday. We're about to serve Cunt. The week leading up to the party was like our own personal revenge makeover montage. We transformed this sad, beautiful man into a full smoke show. Madison took him to her bougie bar, Barber and Soho, who gave him this fade that made his eyes pop like crazy. The beard trim, chef's kiss. Suddenly you could see his whole jawline, and I was like, damn, Jade, you really fumbled that. Rachel dragged him to Nordstrom and had him trying on suits like we were styling for the Met Gala. We found this navy blue situation that hugged him in all the right places. The way it made his shoulders look criminal. I handled the confidence coaching at my Pilates studio, making him practice his walk between reformers. You're a whole ass meal and you need to know it. I kept telling him the group Chat was pure chaos. Pinterest boards for inspiration, voice notes at 2:00am about strategy. Eve found him the perfect date. This absolutely gorgeous marketing director who did Morning Marriage and had legs for actual days. Someone who would make Jade want to crawl into a hole and die. Saturday came, and we assembled at Madison's penthouse like we were preparing for battle. The attention to detail was insane. We had him moisturized, Cologne and all the pulse points. That expensive Tom Ford one that makes you want to climb someone like a tree. Hair styled, but not too styled. The Rolex Rachel borrowed from her dad. Every detail was immaculate. This man, who usually lived in athelesia looked like he should be on a billboard in Times Square. But it wasn't just the fit. It the energy. He wasn't our broken bestie anymore. He was this confident king who finally knew his worth. Our inside sources started sending tea immediately. Jade walking in with Dean, trying to pass him off as Mark to everyone. This mediocre man in his ill fitting suit trying to pretend he knew about Mark's startup. Her boss being all excited to finally meet the boyfriend she literally never shut up about. Then came the moment we've been waiting for. Real Mark.

Three months ago, Malcolm started calling his behavior just jokes whenever I questioned anything. The pattern began in September when I asked him not to flirt with girls at parties. He laughed and told his friends I was obsessed with him. Dean, Randall and Curtis all found this hilarious. They started making comments about clingy girlfriends whenever I was around. Malcolm began testing boundaries. He would dance with other girls at bars and wink at me across the room. He started giving out his number to random women right in front of me. When I confronted him later, I was being completely dramatic about normal social interaction. It's just dancing, he would say, shaking his head like I was completely crazy. His friends backed him up every single time without fail. At Curtis's birthday party last weekend, Malcolm's ex, Sabrina, showed up wearing a tight red dress. She had been messaging Malcolm for weeks, but he claimed they were just being friendly. I watched her touch his arm while talking, running her fingers along his bicep. Malcolm kept glancing at me, smirking. His friends, Dean and Randall, positioned themselves nearby with their phones out, recording everything. The party was packed with people from our college and nearby schools. Malcolm had been drinking steadily since we arrived at 8. He kept buying Sabrina drinks and completely ignoring me for hours every time I tried to. Join their conversation. He would turn his back to me or change the subject entirely. Around 11, Malcolm grabbed Sabrina by the waist and pulled her close. He kissed her with full tongue, hands gripping her hips. The kiss lasted at least 30 seconds. Dean and Randall started chanting immediately. She deserved it. She deserved it, they yelled, pointing their cameras directly at me. Other people turned to watch the spectacle. Some laughed, others looked uncomfortable but said nothing. Malcolm pulled away from Sabrina and stared straight at me. Just a joke, babe, he called out, grinning. Sabrina giggled and whispered something in his ear. He nodded and squeezed her waist again. I walked through the crowd toward the front door. People moved aside and stared. My phone started buzzing before I reached my car, text after text appeared on my screen. Malcolm was sending them faster than I could read, 15 messages total by the time I got home. You're ruining my night. Come back right now and apologize to Sabrina. Stop being so dramatic about everything. Everyone at this party thinks you're completely psycho now. This is exactly why guys don't want serious girlfriends. You totally embarrassed me in front of all my friends. Learn to take a harmless joke for once in your life. I drove home and turned off my phone completely. When I checked at Sunday morning, Malcolm had posted six Instagram stories between midnight and 3:00am, videos of him grinding on random girls at The party, close up shots of women dancing against him. Each caption read variations of this is what happens when you try to control me and freedom feels so good right now. The final story showed Malcolm doing shots with three different girls. The caption read, single life hits different. He had tagged Dean, Randall and Curtis in every single post. Malcolm showed up at my apartment building at 3:00am Sunday morning. He pounded on the front door for five straight minutes yelling my name loud enough to wake up neighboring units. When I finally opened it, he reeked of alcohol, cigarettes and multiple different perfumes. His button down shirt was wrinkled and stained with something dark. His hair stuck up in random directions. You're a psycho girlfriend, he said, swaying in my doorway. Every guy cheats on their girl eventually. At least I did it to your face instead of sneaking around behind your back like some coward. I told him to leave immediately. He laughed and leaned against the door frame. You'll forgive me by Tuesday like you always do, he said. Remember when I made out with your sister's friend at Christmas? You got over that real quick. Then he stumbled back to his car and drove away. Monday afternoon, Dean sent me a private message on Instagram. You're way too uptight about everything. Malcolm was teaching you an important lesson about trust and boundaries. You should be grateful he cares enough to help you grow as A person. I read the message twice, then close the app. Twenty minutes later, Celeste sent me a message. She's Curtis's girlfriend and had seen the group chat on his phone. She forwarded me 23 screenshots from their conversations.

What was the experience like? My parents signed our family up for World's Strictest Parents when I was 15 and didn't tell me until the night before filming. They packed my bag and said we were going on a trip to teach me some discipline. I thought they meant like a family vacation or something. Boy, was I wrong. We showed up to this farm in rural Texas where I'd be staying with the host family for a week. The cameras were already rolling when I met the walkers, this super intense couple who looked like they hadn't smiled since 1995. They immediately took my phone, laptop, everything that connected me to the outside world. Missus Walker told me I'd be getting up at 4:00am every morning to milk cows and do farm chores. The first day was brutal. I'm from the suburbs. I'd never even seen a cow up close. But I played along because I figured it was just for the cameras and they'd edit it to look dramatic. What I didn't realize was how controlling these people actually were. They made me write these long essays every night about my bad behaviour and why I was a disappointment to my parents. If I didn't write enough, they'd make me start over. Missus Walker would scream in my face for the smallest things. Like if I smiled too much during chores. She'd say I wasn't Taking it seriously, if I didn't smile enough, I was being disrespectful. The host dad threatened to break my phone, even though production had already locked it away. These people were upset with breaking me down completely. On day four, there was another team there named Brandon who got locked in a tool shed for three hours because he talked back during breakfast. Cameras weren't rolling when it happened. I could hear him having a panic attack in there, hyperventilating and crying. That's when I realized this wasn't just about making good TV. These people were genuinely messed up. That night, I convinced Brandon to help me sneak into the production van parked outside. The crew always left it unlocked because we were supposedly being watched 24 seven. Inside, we found boxes of unlabeled tapes with footage they'd shot but weren't planning to use. We started watching some of them on the monitor. There was video of Mister Walker grabbing a kid by his shirt collar and shoving him against a wall. And other tape showed Missus Walker making a girl eat spoiled food as punishment. They had footage of kids crying themselves to sleep that they'd filmed through bedroom windows. This wasn't discipline. It was straight up abuse that they were hiding from the final edit. When the producers caught us in the van at, like, 2 a m, they freaked out and demanded we hand over the tapes. I told them absolutely not and that I'd call the Police if they tried to take them from us. The head producer started threatening to sue my parents, saying we violated our contract by accessing production materials. I didn't care. I told them they could edit me however they wanted, but I was keeping these tapes as evidence of what really happened. Brandon backed me up, even though he was terrified his parents would kill him. Production shut down filming two days early and made both our families sign these huge NDAs. They said if we ever talked about what we saw on those tapes, they'd sue us for everything we had. My parents were furious with me for embarrassing them on national TV. The show still aired six months later, but my segment was completely butchered. They edited it to make me look like the spoiled brat who Learned nothing from the experience. They cut out all the worst stuff the host family did and made it seem like I was just being dramatic about normal punishments. People at school saw it and thought,

My family had this super weird rule that I never understood until years later. We were never allowed to use the front door of our house, like ever. Not for anything. Not when leaving for school, not when friends came over, not even when we ordered pizza. Everyone had to use the side door that LED through our mudroom into the kitchen. Tbh, it was embarrassing of as a kid. Friends would come over, they'd naturally walk up to the front door and I'd have to awkwardly redirect them like, oh, no, sorry, we don't use that door. And they give me the weirdest looks. I remember when I was like 8, my friend Amara came over for the first time and went straight to the front door. My mom saw through the window and literally ran to intercept her before she could ring the doorbell. He practically dragged her around to the side entrance while giving this awkward explanation about family tradition and house rules. Poor Amara looked so confused and probably thought we were in some weird cult or something. Lol. The front door wasn't broken or anything. It was a perfectly normal door with a deadbolt and everything. Sometimes I catch my mom staring at it with this weird sad expression. But when I asked about it, she changed the subject super fast. My dad was even more intense about it. If any of us kids even joked about using the front door, he'd get this scary serious look and say, we never use that door, end of discussion. The side door thing became such a huge part of our family identity that I just accepted it as normal after a while. Like I stopped questioning it. Our house was on a corner lot, so the side door faced the street anyway. And we had this cute little stone path leading to it with solar lights and everything. My parents put a lot of effort into making the side entrance look welcoming, but I still couldn't help wondering about the front door. It was this big mystery in my life. When I turned 16, I had this huge party planned and I was so stressed about explaining the door thing to all my new high school friends, I finally broke down and begged my parents to just tell me why so I could have a better explanation than it's just our family rule. They looked at each other for a long time having one of those silent parent conversations, but they still refused to explain. My brother Joshua thought it was because someone had died there. My sister Brianna was convinced our house used to be a drug den and there were secret police cameras watching the front door. Came up with all these wild theories, but none of them seem to fit. The real breaking point came when I was 18, my Uncle Ryland came to visit with his new wife who none of us had met before. No one told her about the door rule. She arrived while we were all in the backyard having a BBQ and use the front door. The instant the doorbell rang, my mom dropped an entire plate of food and my dad knocked over the grill trying to get to the door. It was absolute chaos. By the time they reached the front door, my uncle's wife was already inside looking completely bewildered at the mess in the backyard. She could see through the window. My mom burst into tears and ran to her bedroom. My dad just stood there frozen, staring at the open front door like he was seeing a ghost. My uncle looked so confused and kept asking what was happening. But my dad just quietly closed the door and took everyone back outside. That night, I heard my parents fighting for the first time ever. My mom was crying and saying, it's been almost 20 years, Frank. Maybe it's time to let it go. My dad kept saying, I can't. I just can't. I had never heard him sound so broken. I left for college a few months later and the door mystery was still unresolved. Every time I came home for breaks, we still use the side door. It had been 19 years of this nonsense and I was determined to finally get answers. Last Christmas break, I Decided I couldn't take it anymore. I sat both my parents.

My younger sister, Ariana, turned into a homewrecker the moment my husband Kevin slipped the ring on my finger and started a desperate pick me routine. If Kevin were blue, she'd show up in blue. If you mention liking something, she'd become an expert over. If he posted about a restaurant, she coincidentally appeared during our date. It started subtle, almost innocent even, like sitting next to Kevin. At every family dinner, Ariana would squeeze between us, claiming she couldn't hear from the other end. I didn't mind, since family is family, but after six months, it got obvious. Kevin joined a gym near his office. Ariana got a membership there the next day, showing up during his workout times and tiny sports bras. Kevin mentioned liking astronomy once. Suddenly, Ariana was texting him NASA articles daily, asking, can you explain this to me? Then came the fake emergencies. Her car broke down near Kevin's office. Her apartment had a gas leak. When I was out of town, she needed help moving heavy boxes that turned out to be empty. Kevin always told me immediately, showing me her texts with eye rolls. She's just young and confused, he'd say, and I agreed. Until she officially went too far. A hard knock at 9:00am, and there stood Ariana in a tiny white sundress, full makeup, hair curled like a magazine. Shoot! I need Kevin's help moving furniture, she announced, pushing past me. Where is he? But we both knew she lived in a furnished apartment. I was about to tell her to leave when she added, I'm sure you have errands to run. You can go away now. She was literally trying to dismiss me from my own home. Kevin came downstairs, and she immediately grabbed his arm. Oh, perfect. You're already dressed. I promise I'll return him in one piece. She actually winked at me. I felt my chest burn with rage, but then had a different thought. I headed upstairs, loudly saying, I need to take a bath. But I didn't leave or go to the bathroom. I stayed upstairs where I could hear everything through the vents. She didn't waste any time. Oh, my god, Kevin, you're so muscular! She giggled, clearly touch in his arm. Do you work out every day? I bet you could lift me with one hand. Wanna try? I rolled my eyes. This girl had zero shame. I kept folding laundry, waiting for Kevin's polite deflection. Instead, I heard him say, Ariana, can I tell you something important? My heart sank. Oh, god, here we go. Two years of marriage down the drain because my sister can't keep her hands to herself. Of course she chirped. You can tell me anything, Kevin. Long pause. Too long. What was he thinking about? I need you to stop this behavior immediately. Wait, what? Stop What? She played innocent. A defensive edge creeping in. The flirting, the constant texting, the fake emergencies, the revealing outfits. All of it stops now. I don't know what you mean. Because he interrupted voice deadly serious. Your sister is the only woman I have ever loved or will love. Like, scary level obsessed love. I literally cannot see other women as romantic possibilities. Brain doesn't register them as options. Dead silence downstairs. I crept to the stairs, hardly breathing. When your sister walks into any room, everyone else becomes invisible to me. Including you. Ariana's voice got shrill. But I'm five years younger. I'm prettier. I have a better body. I wouldn't care if you were a supermodel. My wife could gain 200 pounds, lose her hair, get covered in scars, and I'd still choose her over anyone on this planet. Without hesitation. The door slammed so hard our wedding picture rattled. I came downstairs 10 minutes later, pretending to be back from the store. Kevin was sitting on the couch, looking at exhausted Ariana. Left already? I asked innocently. He pulled me into his lap and held me tight. She won't be coming around anymore, he said simply. And he was right. Ariana tried everything to say face. I called my mom, crying that Kevin had misunderstood her friendship. She told her dad that Kevin was possessive and controlling. She even posted on Facebook about toxic masculinity and men who can't handle confident women. But Kevin had saved Every text, every inappropriate photo, every time stamp of her fake emergencies. When she kept pushing her narrative. He sent one group message to our family with just three screenshots. For asking him to meet. We're at a hotel. Her sending lingerie photos, and her text saying, you could do so much better than my sister. The family response was immediate. Mom called Ariana disgusting. Dad said she needed therapy. Our cousins unfriended her. Our grandmother removed

My wife, Julia, has this thing about getting weird feelings about stuff. After eight years of marriage, I'd Learned to trust her instincts even when they made zero sense. Last Saturday morning, she woke up and told me to skip my fishing trip with the guys and come with her to a flea market two towns over. When I asked why, she just shrugged and said she had a weird feeling I should be there. I was pretty annoyed. I've been looking forward to fishing all week and driving 40 minutes to look at old junk wasn't exactly my idea of fun. But Julia kept insisting, saying she couldn't shake the feeling that something important was waiting for us there. She promised to make my favorite dinner if I came along, so I gave in. We got to the flea market early, around 7 in the morning. The place was huge with hundreds of vendors selling everything from rusty tools to old vinyl records. Julia dragged me past tables of dusty books and broken appliances until she stopped dead at this one vendor's table. An elderly woman was selling wooden crates and boxes. Most of them look like they've been sitting in someone's basement for decades. Julia pointed at one specific crate that was nailed shut. It was about the size of a shoebox made of dark wood that looked really old. The woman wanted $30 for It which seemed crazy for something we couldn't even see inside. But Julia wouldn't budge. She said she wanted that exact crate and nothing else would do. I rolled my eyes but carried it to the car. On the drive home, I kept asking what she thought was in there, but she just said she didn't know. She touching the crate like it was precious or something. When we got home, I grabbed a crowbar from the garage and pried off the wooden lid. Inside were stacks of military medals wrapped in faded tissue paper, along with black and white photographs and a leather bound journal. My hands started shaking when I saw the name engraved on the metals, William Chen Harrison. That was my grandfather's full name. He'd served in World War 2 but never talked about his time overseas. He died when I was 12 and my family always said he kept his war experiences to himself. I picked up the journal with trembling fingers. The first page was written in my grandfather's handwriting, which I recognized from birthday cards he used to send me. But this wasn't just war stories. The journal described a hidden stash of war bonds and gold coins he buried in a metal chest on his old farm before he shipped out. He drawn a detailed map showing exactly where he buried it, near an old oak tree behind the storage shed. The farm was still in our family's name, though it had been Abandoned for years, my dad had inherited it but never did anything with the property since it was way out in the middle of nowhere. According to the journal, my grandfather had planned to dig up the treasure when he got back from the war and use it to buy a house for his secret fiance, a woman named.

Whenever I met someone new through dating apps or friends, I take them to this little Italian place called Nana's on our first date. Not because the food was amazing, though it was pretty good, but because their service was intentionally slow. I'm talking like you'd wait 20 minutes just to get water. The kitchen was always backed up because they only had two cooks for the whole restaurant. Most people who went there regularly knew this and just enjoyed the atmosphere. But I used as my own personal dating filter. My coworker Jess set me up with this guy, Daniel she knew from her gym. He seemed decent enough over text, had a good job, liked dogs, usual green flags. We agreed to meet at Nana's on a Thursday night. I got there first and warned the hostess Maria that I was doing my usual test. She laughed and said she'd make sure our table got the full experience. Been coming there for two years so the staff knew my deal by now. Daniel showed up right on time wearing a nice button down and jeans. Good start. We sat down and Maria handed us menus, then disappeared for exactly 15 minutes before coming back for our drink order. That's when I noticed Daniel's first reaction. He kept checking his phone and looking around like he was trying to flag down a waiter. When Maria finally came back, he ordered a Beer with this tight smile that didn't reach his eyes. Our drinks took another 20 minutes. I watched Daniel's jaw clench as he started tapping his fork against the table. When Maria brought the bread basket, he muttered under his breath, finally, Jesus. I pretended not to hear it and asked him about his work. He answered, but I could tell he was distracted. Every few minutes, he glanced toward the kitchen or check the time on his phone. By the time our entrees came out, we'd been there for over an hour. Daniel's chicken Parmesan looked amazing, but his face was pure frustration. I apologized and said the service was usually faster, which was a complete lie. He waved me off and said, yeah, well, some people just don't know how to run a business properly. Then he took a huge bite and chewed aggressively. That's when Maria walked by our table and Daniel raised his voice loud enough for half the restaurant to hear. Hey, think we'll get dessert before midnight or should I just order it for tomorrow? I felt my stomach drop. Maria's face went red, but she just nodded and hurried away. I knew she had absolutely no control over how fast the kitchen worked. She was just trying to do her job. But Daniel wasn't done. When she brought our check, he pulled out a calculator app on his phone and started doing math out loud. Eighteen percent of 43 dollars? Nah, that's way Too much for this kind of service. He left exactly two dollars on a 43 dollar Bill. Two dollars. I stared at the money on the table. That's only like 4%, he shrugged. I'm not here to fund. In confidence, maybe next time they'll get their act together. I pulled out a 20 and put it next to his $2. The waitress doesn't control how fast the kitchen works, Daniel laughed. That's their problem to figure out. I paid for a service and the serve.

My parents had one non negotiable rule about dating, absolutely not until college or they would ship me off to my grandmother's house in rural Montana or the nearest boy my age lived 40 miles away. They had already threatened this twice when they caught me texting guys from school after they confiscated my phone for a week and made me write a five page essay on why teenage romance destroys academic achievement. I was completely desperate. Problem was that I was hopelessly infatuated with Adrian, the smartest guy in my AP history class and I was running out of time because he was transferring schools at the end of the semester. I carefully analyzed their exact wording of the role. They. I said no dating and no boyfriends, but they never mentioned anything about academic partnerships or study groups. This became my loophole. I approached my parents with a proposal for a peer tutoring exchange program where I would help struggling students with English while receiving advanced help and subjects like calculus and history. I emphasized how this would strengthen my college applications and demonstrate leadership skills. What I didn't mention was that Adrian would be my primary tutoring partner. My parents were thrilled and immediately extended my after school privileges specifically for tutoring activities, allowing me to stay out until eight PM for these educational purposes. For the next month, Adrian and I met three times a week. At the library, coffee shops and eventually each other's houses when parents weren't home, we genuinely did study together, but we also made out constantly and had deep conversations about everything except academics. My parents checked on our progress. I showed them my improved calculus grades and Adrian's essay improvements. The system worked perfectly until something completely unexpected happened. Our fake tutoring program actually transformed both of us into academic monsters. Adrian, who had been struggling with writing, suddenly started producing essays that made our teachers weep with joy. I discovered that explaining complex literature concepts to him help me understand them more deeply than I ever thought possible. Within six weeks, we had both raised our Gpas so dramatically that other students started begging to when our study group. Then came the twist that changed everything. Adrian's parents, who were getting divorced, decided he needed to move to California immediately. Instead of at the end of the semester, he had three days before leaving forever. I was devastated, but I also realized something terrifying. I, I'd become so academically successful through our sessions that I was now ranked No. 1 in our entire class. Without Adrian, I'd be single and back to my old mediocre academic ways. Then the guidance counselor called my parents to inform them that their daughter was suddenly the front runner for valedictorian. During that phone call, she made a fatal mistake. She enthusiastically praised our innovative romantic partnership approach to academic excellence and mentioned How our couple dynamic had created such incredible results. When my parents heard the word romantic, everything exploded. That evening, my parents stormed into my room with suitcases. Pack your bags, dad said. You're going to Montana tonight. So you've been dating this boy the whole time. While lying to our faces, mom screamed, you manipulated us into helping you break the one rule we cared about most. I panicked and blurted out the truth. Wait, you cannot send me away now because I am literally.

I was in Mr Andeta's history class when the announcement came over the intercom. Code Red. Code red. This is not a drill. Everyone froze. We practiced this 100 times. Lock the door. Turn off the lights. Hide in the corner. Mr Andeta immediately jumped up and reached for the door lock. Then Vice Principal Medina's voice boomed through the speaker. False alarm, everyone. Some prankster called in a fake threat. Continue with your lessons. Do not lock your doors. I repeat, do not initiate lockdown procedures. Mr Andeta hesitated with his hand on the lock. My friend Maddie whispered from her desk. But they said Code red. That's the real signal. Mr Aneta looked confused. The VP says it's fake, though. Then we heard it. Footsteps running down the hallway, not walking, running hard and fast like someone was being chased. Mr Medina's voice came back on. Teachers, I said, continue teaching. Any classroom that locks their door will have their teacher written up for insubordination. Mr Reneda slowly backed away from the door. He looked scared but sat back at his desk. Everyone stay calm. Let's continue with the lesson. Sweat was dripping from his forehead and nobody could focus. The running footsteps kept happening, first on our floor, then above us and back again. I pulled out my phone and opened our school's parent Facebook group. My mom had posted that police were surrounding the School. They told us someone called about a weapon. She spammed my phone saying she loves me. My hands started shaking. I showed Maddie the post. Her face went white. She raised her hand. Mr Aneta, my mom says the police are outside. Mr Aneta walked to the window and peeked through the blinds. He gasped loudly. There were six police cars in the parking lot. Mr Medina came on again. Students ignore any social media posts. This is a routine false alarm. Any student caught on their phone will receive immediate suspension. Any teacher who initiates lockdown will be terminated. I saw Mr Aneta's jaw clench. We could hear doors slamming somewhere in the building, not closing, slamming like someone was checking rooms. Then we heard something that made everyone freeze. The fire exit at the end of our hallway opened and slammed shut. Someone was on our floor. Maddie grabbed my arm so tight it hurt. The footsteps were getting closer, classroom by classroom. Mr Grenada stood up and walked toward the door again, but he stopped. He looked at us and at the door and back at us. The footsteps stopped right outside our room. That's when Pete, the quiet kid who never talked, stood up, grabbed his desk and started dragging it toward the door. Mr Aneta, help me now. Mr Aneta snapped out of it. What are you doing? Pete didn't stop. My dad's a cop, he said. If we ever hear Code Red, we Lock down. No matter what anyone says, even the principal. The doorknob started to turn. Everyone moved at once. Kids grabbed desks and chairs and shoved them against the door. Mr Araneta finally joined us. Lights, someone get the lights. Maddie hit the switch. We pushed everything we could find against that door. The person outside pushed hard. The door opened a crack but hit our barricade. They pushed harder. Mr Medina's voice screamed through the intercom. Which classroom is refusing to follow directions? You will all be expelled. But we didn't care about.

My four year old son was determined to meet his girlfriend at preschool. Every morning, he'd ask if today was the day he could marry Maddie. I kept saying, maybe when you're older, buddy. He'd been talking about this girl non stop for weeks, drawing her pictures of stick figures, holding hands, and asking if I could teach him how to make a wedding cake. Even started saving his allowance quarters in a jar labeled for Maddie's ring and his messy crayon handwriting. This morning was different. He woke up in his Sunday clothes, hair slicked back back with water, carrying a plastic ring from a cereal box. Kind with the fake diamond that turns your finger green after five minutes of wearing it. Today is the day, mom. I tried explaining, that's not how it works. Marriage is for grown UPS, but he was already by the door with his backpack, straightening his little tie that was crooked as always. He'd even brushed his teeth without being asked, which should have been my first warning sign. Fine, let's go to school. The walk felt longer than usual because he kept practicing his proposal speech under his breath, caught bits and pieces about promising to share his goldfish crackers forever and never pulling her pigtails, even when she was being annoying. During story time, we walked into his classroom, and I watched him march straight to Maddie's table. With the confidence of a man on a mission, she was coloring quietly with her friend Sarah, completely unaware of what was about to happen to her. Tuesday morning cleared his throat loudly like he'd seen in movies. The whole table looked out on their artwork. He got down on one knee right there on the alphabet carpet, wobbling slightly but maintaining his position. Maddie, will you marry me? The entire classroom went silent. Even missus Madison stopped mid sentence while reading to the other kids in the corner. Twenty pairs of tiny eyes stared at the scene unfolding like they were watching the most dramatic soap opera episode ever. Maddie looked at the ring, looked at him, and said very seriously, do you have a job? My heart melted. This four year old was conducting proper job interview before accepting a marriage proposal. I help my mom with dishes every night and I feed my fish every day without forgetting. Do you have a car? My mom drives me everywhere, but I know where she keeps the. Please. Do you have your own house? Paused, thinking hard. Could see the wheels turning in his little brain as he tried to figure out the best answer. but I have bunk beds and my own night light that looks like a Dinosaur. Maddie considered this for a moment, tapping her purple crayon against her chin like she was making the most important business decision of her life. Do you like Princess movies only the ones with

And when people reasonably get upset, start acting as if they're being discriminated against or something like, girl, you do realize you don't have to participate in every trend and change the meaning of things to fit your situation, especially when you're the one in the privileged position and have always had more than enough representation in all forms of media. If the trend is about trans people and you're not trans, then just do a different trend. If the trend is about a lesbian relationship and you're straight or something, then once again just do a different trend. There's actually so many options for you specifically. There is no reason you should want to include yourself in something for queer people that badly. It's baffling to me why you can't stand not being included for two seconds. And then as a little cherry on top, there are straight people who say dumbass shit about normalizing being straight. Be so fucking for real right now. You think straight people are so rare nowadays? What planet do you live on? Can I come over? Because genuinely, when was the last time these people stepped outside? There is no place on this entire earth where being straight isn't quite literally the norm. What are y'all even talking about?

So either go take your Bible quotes to someone who wants them or just stop bringing your religion up like a normal person. Not everything has to be about you. And I swear it's only Christians doing this too. I'm not sure if you guys remember, but a while ago Christians were blowing up about Sailor Song because of the lyric, I don't believe in God. It's almost like if the song says that it's made for people who don't believe in God, sorry, but the world isn't going to be catered to your specific beliefs and that doesn't make you a victim. If you do believe in God and like the song, that's fine. But stop bitching about the lyric and just don't sing it. It's really not that hard. No one's holding you at gunpoint. Someone saying they don't share your beliefs isn't a crime, bro. Practicing your religion in church or at home is totally fine, but you can't expect people to care once you're in the outside world. Please just shut up about it for once also, because people are going to get mad. I'm not Saying all Christians are like this. I literally have Christian friends that are totally awesome, but this video is to the ones that try to shove God in everyone's faces or dictate other people's lives based on their beliefs. Okay, bye.

You're still starving. And the worst part is the one goofball who doesn't even like pizza. He just sits there eating his regular packed lunch. Judging all of you. This wasn't a party. It was a 15 minute event of managed disappointment. I'm completely cooked and still hungry.

Because lately I can't stop thinking about my friend group from 2024. Like, that was honestly one of the happiest times of my life. Those people, they were the best. We laughed until we cried. We had those stupid inside jokes that nobody else would get. We stayed up late talking about nothing and everything. And I didn't even realize back then that those were the memories I'd hold on to forever. And now we don't talk anymore. People drifted. Life changed. And I hate it, because I didn't think those moments were going to end. I thought that group would always be there. And do you remember how we sneak out late at night, running through quiet streets, feeling like rebels? Even though we weren't doing anything crazy, just living, just existing together. It felt like we owned the whole world. I'm still close with three of them, and I'm so thankful for that. But it's not the same without the rest. When we're together now, there's always that empty space, like something's missing. Like the music isn't as loud as it used to be. And, yeah, I'm happy I even got to experience that kind of friendship, but, wow, it hurts. It feels like this little piece of me is still stuck back in 2024, laughing with them, being happy, without even realizing how lucky I was.

And the answer destroyed our family. Nobody had spoken Aunt Minerva in 15 years. She was the crazy one who collected vintage dolls and claimed the government was monitoring her bird feeders. When cousin of Angeline got the call that Minerva had died, we all pretended to be sad while secretly calculating what her Victorian mansion might be worth. The will reading was chaos. 23 relatives crammed into a stuffy law office, everyone wearing their most respectful black clothes while their eyes gleamed with greed. The lawyer adjusted his glasses and read, my fortune goes to whoever answers this. What room in my house contains the thing I loved most, yet no one was ever allowed to enter? We ransacked that mansion like pirates. Dad jimmied locks. Mom crawled through the basement with a flashlight. Uncle Fletcher hired a locksmith for the third floor storage room that had been welded shut for decades. Everyone assumed it was some hidden safe or secret chamber filled with cash. I was 17 and bored, so I did what teenagers do. I snooped through her personal stuff. In her bedroom dresser, I found a photo album labeled my darling. Every page showed the same little girl. Birthday parties, first mornings, first days of school. The child had Minerva's same sharp nose and wild, curly hair. In the final photo, the girl was maybe six, sitting on Minerva's lap in This very mansion. At the bottom someone had written Cordelia Marie, age 6, 1957. My blood went cold. I never heard of any Cordelia in our family. That night I cornered my grandmother in the kitchen. Who is Cordelia? I asked. Grandma's face went white. She glanced around nervously, then pulled me aside. Minerva's daughter, she whispered. Born when Minerva was sixteen. The family made her give the baby up for adoption to avoid scandal. What happened to her? Grandma's voice cracked. Leukemia. She died at 7. Minerva never forgave us. The next morning I walked into that law office alone. The answer is her daughter's bedroom.

It started about 6 months ago. Every argument, every little thing that didn't go her way, slam. Every time I asked her to do dishes, slam. When I told her she couldn't go to some party where I knew they'd be drinking, slam. The sound would shake the whole upstairs. My coffee mug fell off my nightstand twice from the vibrations. My husband Dave kept telling me to ignore it. He'd say kids go through phases. She'll grow out of it. Easy for him to say since he's usually at work when most of the slamming happens. I'm the one working from home trying to take client calls while slam echoes through the house. Breaking point came on a Tuesday. Emma wanted to borrow my car to drive to her friend Jesse's house. I said no because she got a speeding ticket the week before and we agreed her driving privileges were suspended. She started screaming about how unfair I was, how I never trust her, how all her friends think I'm psycho. Then she stomped upstairs and slam. But this time was different. This time I heard something crack. I went up to check and there was a split running down the door frame. The wood was actually damaged. That door had been slammed so hard and so many times that it was breaking the house. I stood there staring at that crack and something just snapped. In me. I marched to the garage, grabbed Dave's screwdriver set and went back upstairs. Emma was inside her room blasting music, probably expecting me to yell at her through the door like usual. Instead, I started unscrewing the hinges. It took me about 10 minutes. Emma didn't even notice until I was lifting the door off the frame. Then her music stopped. Real quick, mom, what are you doing? She called out. Solving a problem, I said. Carrying her door downstairs to the garage, she appeared at the top of the stairs in her pajamas, mouth hanging open. You can't take my door. I need privacy. You lost door privileges when you damaged the house. I told her privacy is earned, not guaranteed. The next few days were interesting. Emma tried everything. She hung a bed sheet across the doorway, which I took down. She moved her dresser to block the opening so I moved it back. While she was at school, she even tried staying at her friend's house, but Jess's mom called me asking what was going on. By day 4, Emma was sitting on her bed when I got home from the grocery store. No music, no phone, just sitting there. This is embarrassing, she said. What if someone comes over? Then maybe you'll think twice before destroying property. I said, I wasn't destroying anything. I was just mad. The door frame says otherwise. That's when she actually looked at the crack she'd made. I could See her face change when she realized she'd actually damaged something. Day 7 was when things got real. Emma's boyfriend, Tyler, came over to work on some school project. I watched.

You said you're RCTA and LGBTQ in one of your videos and why are you even judging gay people when they're part of LGBTQ too? And I'm too young to get a job I'm still in school just like you kiddo you're just a gold digger digging for gold and I found gold and the gold is my boyfriend, friends family and baddies I don't need real gold to be happy imagine doing these dot content for money I actually don't get that much money from it BC I just hit 1 0 k a few days ago plus I'm not doing it for money because I didn't actually think I would hit 100 k I'm doing it to make people laugh no one even likes you if no one would like me then no one would like my videos and follow dot me your father must not be ashamed of you he's totally not ashamed of me and he love me so much isn't your Mom ashamed of you instead. So Noah, if you see this, tell her own fans to that tag you two boys. I already told them. Oh, they won't BC that are gay. They probably already tagged me. I just need to check. Yeah, I'm gay, but it doesn't mean I'm simping to pixels. Plus I already have a boyfriend and I don't need another one. So as I said in my previous video, I will gladly react to boys video and I'm going to ask you again, why are you so desperate and why now? I can respond to this tomorrow and even after a week, you're just a desperate hater craving for attention from me. And I wouldn't respond to this because I'm sick and I don't feel well dot but I decided to respond to these shitty comebacks. So I hope you'll do well in 1st grade.

And it doesn't matter. Like, bro, real friends don't need to be in the same classroom or even the same postcode to stay tight. You could be across the city in a different uniform learning completely different subjects, but somehow the bond never fades. Everyone else is like, oh, if you don't go to the same school, you'll drift apart. Nah, bro, not us. I could be sitting in math class stressed out over equations I'll never use in life, and you're across town doing science experiments and we're still texting dumb memes like we saw each other five minutes ago. And when we do link up on the weekend, it's like we never left. No awkward vibes, no weird energy, just straight vibes, bro. We might not be in the same school, but we've got the same mindset, same humor, same jokes, same energy. And the best part, when you meet their school friends and suddenly you feel famous, like, oh, you're that friend they always talk about, yeah, that's me. I don't even go here, but I run this friendship. So if you've got a friend that's in another school but still feels closer than anyone in your class, appreciate that. That's real friendship. Forget proximity. It's about loyalty.

I was raw dogging mimosas with my girls at Sunday brunch when Jade's phone lit up while she was in the bathroom. A text from someone named Dean, eggplant emoji. My stomach dropped. The thing is Jade's boyfriend is named Mark and Mark is like the most perfect man ever created. He's the guy who texts, did you get home safe? And actually waits for a response. This man brought us all pink panties on Valentine's Day because he wanted to thank the girls who keep Jade glowing. I snatched her phone before she came back from touching up her lip gloss in the bathroom. The messages went back months. Hotel meet UPS with mirror selfies, late night, can't wait to taste you again texts. By the time Jade came back, we'd screenshot everything but we acted like nothing happened. She was going on and on about her company holiday party next week and suddenly mentioned how Mark couldn't make it because of some unforeseen work emergency. That's when we knew this speech was bringing Dean. The next day met Mark at this aesthetic little matcha place in Brooklyn. He showed up in his usual hoodie and that man walked in absolutely confused why we emergency summoned him. Watching his face crumble as he scrolled through the screenshots literally really broke my heart. This 6 feet 2 inches golden retriever boy started tearing up right there next to the succulent wall the way he Kept whispering, but I was going to propose at Christmas while staring at his matcha was heartbreaking ASF I wanted to find Jade and snatch her bald. Here was this king who watched Love Island with us without complaining, who was secretly Pinterest boarding their future wedding and she was out here acting like a whole ass fool. That's when Eve had that look on her face, the same energy she had when we orchestrated that whole take down of her toxic pure mastermind vibes. Mark, my love, do you trust us? He just nodded, too heartbroken to speak. Good block out. Next Saturday we're about to serve cunt. The week leading up to the party was like our own personal revenge makeover montage. We transformed this sad beautiful man into a full smoke show. Madison took him to her Bougie Barber in Soho who gave in this fade that made his eyes pop like crazy. The beard trim, chef's kiss. Suddenly you can see his whole jawline and I was like, damn Jade, you really fumbled that. Rachel dragged him to Nordstrom, had him trying on suits like we were styling for the Met Gala. We found this navy blue situation that hugged him in all the right places. The way it made his shoulders look criminal. I handled the confidence coaching at my Pilates studio, making him practice his walk between performers. You're a whole ass meal and you need to know it. I kept telling him the Group chat was pure chaos. Pinterest boards for inspiration, voice notes at 2:00am about strategy. Eve found him the perfect date. This absolutely gorgeous marketing director who did morning marathons and had legs for actual days, some who would make Jade want to crawl into a hole and die. Saturday came and we assembled at Madison's penthouse like we were preparing for battle. The attention to detail was insane. We had him moisturized, Cologne and all the pulse points, that expensive Tom Ford one that makes you want to climb someone like a tree. Hair styled but not too styled. The Rolex Rachel borrowed from her dad. Every detail was immaculate. This man who usually lived in Athlesia looked like he should be on a billboard in Times Square. But it wasn't just the fit, it was the energy. He wasn't our broken bestie anymore. He was this confident king who finally knew his worth. Our inside sources started sending tea immediately. Jade walking in with Dean trying to pass him off as Mark to everyone. This mediocre man in his ill fitting suit trying to pretend he knew about Mark's startup. Her boss being all excited to finally meet the boyfriend she literally never shut up about. Then came the moment we've been waiting for, real Mark.

Every five minutes it was Mom, Tommy touched my stuff or Mom, Tommy looked at me weird or Mom, Tommy breathed too loud during my show. I was losing my mind with the constant interruptions throughout every single day. The breaking point came during an important work call when Lily burst into my office screaming that Tommy had walked past her bedroom door without asking permission first. and three clients heard the entire down through my unmuted microphone. I was absolutely mortified and knew something had to change. So I implemented a tattling tax system. Every time she tattled on Tommy for something minor or petty, she owed me 25 cents from her weekly allowance money. Only real emergencies were free, like if someone was actually hurt, breaking something valuable or doing something genuinely dangerous that required intervention. I spent an entire evening explaining this some carefully to both kids, creating specific examples of what counted as tattling versus legitimate concerns that needed my attention. Lily seemed to understand the rules perfectly and even nodded enthusiastically when I said this would help her think before complaining. Tommy just looked absolutely relieved that his sister might finally leave him alone. The tattling stopped immediately and completely. For two absolutely blissful weeks, our house was perfectly quiet. No constant complaints echoing through every room, no sibling drama interrupting my work calls or peaceful evenings. I could actually Focus on important tasks without being summoned every few minutes to referee microscopic disputes. Tommy seemed genuinely happier during this peaceful period, playing freely in common areas without his sister monitoring his every single move like a tiny surveillance officer. He started laughing more often, running around the house without constantly looking over his shoulder, and even began voluntarily leaving his room instead of hiding from Lily's watchful eyes. I bragged extensively to my mom, my sister and my co workers about my brilliant parenting breakthrough. My sister asked for detailed instructions to try with her own constantly bickering kids. My mom laughed and said I should seriously consider writing a parenting book about creative discipline techniques. I was feeling incredibly proud of solving our biggest household problems so elegantly. But after those perfect weeks ended, Tommy gradually started acting increasingly strange and withdrawn. He'd visibly flinch when I walked into rooms and kept asking completely random anxious questions, just like, are you mad at me about something or did I do something wrong today? When I asked what was specifically bothering him, he just mumble nothing, never mind, and quickly run to his room. At first, I assumed he was just adjusting to having less daily conflict with his sister. Kids can.

I'm 22, Alex is 23, and we've been roommates for a year. I've always been cool with gay people. Had a gay friend in high school, never bothered me. Alex and I became close friends pretty quickly. We'd watch movies together, cook dinner, joke around constantly. He's honestly one of the funniest people I know, and we have this weird chemistry where we can talk for hours about absolutely nothing. But recently, when Alex brings guys over, I get this weird angry feeling in my chest that I can't explain. It started about three months ago when I came home early from work and saw him making out with some tall athletic guy on our couch. They were really going at it and I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach. I wanted to punch something, which made absolutely no sense. I mumbled an awkward apology and locked myself in my room for the rest of the night, blasting music to drown out any sounds. Since then, every single time and he has a date over, I become this bitter cold version of myself that I don't even recognize. I'll give his dates dirty looks when they walk in, make sarcastic comments under my breath, or just disappeared to my room and blast music until they leave. One guy tried to Politely introduce himself in our kitchen, and I literally just walked past him like he didn't exist. Another time, I came home and saw Alex cuddling with someone while watching Netflix, and I made such a loud, dramatic entrance that they both depart. Alex started noticing my attitude, and it was seriously affecting our friendship. We went from hanging out every single night, cooking together, and having our stupid inside jokes to bear. We speaking to each other. The apartment felt hence and uncomfortable all the time. Last week, he finally confronted me in our kitchen while I was aggressively washing dishes after another one of his dates had just left. Dude, seriously, what's your problem? You've been a complete jerk to every guy I bring over. I couldn't look at him. Just kept scrubbing the same plate over and over. I don't have a problem. That's bullshit and you know it. You're acting like I'm doing something wrong by dating people. I finally turned around, feeling frustrated and cornered. I'm not homophobic, if that's what you're thinking. His face softened a little. I never said you were homophobic. But something's clearly bothering you, and it's making things weird between us. I couldn't explain the rage I felt seeing him with other people. This sick, jealous feeling that made no sense. So I just said I was stressed about work and walked away from the conversation. Then my mom came to visit for the weekend. She met Alex, and instantly Loved him. They spent hours talking while I was at work, bonding over cooking shows and sharing embarrassing stories about me. That Sunday night, after some of his friends stopped by to hang out, she pulled me aside in my room with this knowing look on her face. Honey, that boy is absolutely head over heels for you. I laughed. Nerd. Obviously, mom, he's gay and I'm straight. We're just roommates and friends. She gave me that look mothers have when they know something you don't. Trust me, I know what pining looks like. I've been watching people fall in love for 50 years. The way he talks about you, remembers every little thing you like, lights up when you walk in the room. You're not just his roommate to him. Sweetie. That's ridiculous, mom. And you, she continued, crossing her arms, are acting exactly like a jealous boyfriend. All that anger when he brings dates home. That's not homophobic

And don't even get me started on the bully. It's always some stereotypical jock whose only personality trait is being a hater. He'll do something so corny like trip the main character in the hallway and everyone is supposed to be scared of him. Bro, in real life everyone would just laugh at him. He's not a villain, he's a goofball. The worst part is the random, perfectly choreographed musical number that happens in the middle of the cafeteria. Suddenly every single student knows the same dance move. Bro, in my cafeteria the only thing that's happening is a kid spilling his milk everywhere. This isn't high school. It's a low budget fantasy film and my expectations for real life are completely cooked.

I was a court reporter when a 7 year old had a meltdown during his parents custody hearing and their reactions revealed everything the judge needed to know. The Hendersons have been fighting over custody of little Nathan for six months. Mom Susan arrived in a sharp business suit with her attorney talking loudly about her promotion and new condo. Dad Tom looked tired in his work clothes, having come straight from his construction job to make the two PM hearing. Susan's case seems strong, higher income, stable housing, private school enrollment already arranged. Your honor, I can provide Nathan with opportunities his father simply cannot afford, piano lessons, tutoring, summer camps. Tom's lawyer did his best, but the numbers didn't lie. Tom works long hours for half Susan's salary and lived in a modest apartment. When asked about extracurriculars, Tom quietly said, I help with his homework every night and we go to the park on weekends. Midway through Susan's testimony about her comprehensive parenting plan, Ethan started fidgeting in the gallery where he'd been sitting with a social worker. The seven year old had been silent for an hour but suddenly stood up and said loudly, I need to use the bathroom. The social worker started to get up, but before she could react, both parents moved. What happened next lasted may 10 seconds, but it changed everything. Susan snapped, Nathan, sit down. We're in the middle of Something important. You should have gone before we came in here. She didn't even turn around fully, just shot him an annoyed look over her shoulder. Tom immediately stood up, walked over to Nathan and knelt down to his eye level. Hey, buddy, of course you can go. Let's go right now. He took Nathan's hand naturally like he'd done it a thousand times. I don't want to interrupt the important meeting, Nathan whispered, clearly anxious. You're not interrupting anything, Tom said softly. You're the most important thing here. As they walked toward the door, Nathan suddenly stopped and burst into tears. Not bathroom urgency tears, the big overwhelming sobs of a stressed seven year old who've been holding it together too long. Susan's reaction was to look at her watch and whisper urgently to her lawyer about the delay. She kept glancing at the door like their son's breakdown was an inconvenience to her testimony. Tom just picked Nathan up and held him, not caring that his son's tears were soaking his work shirt. He didn't try to stop the crying or rush him through it.

When Nathan finally calmed down enough to whisper something in his dad's ear, Tom nodded and carried him back into the courtroom. Your honor, Nathan would like to tell you.

My friend Jessica constantly complained about how every guy at our college wasn't good enough for her. She'd literally rate guys walking by like we were judging a beauty pageant. The thing is, Jessica isn't exactly campus royalty herself. She's probably average on her best day, but she acts like she's some Instagram influencer who should only date guys who look like they model for Calvin Klein. She'd reject guys who were genuinely sweet and had good futures just because they didn't look like movie stars. Last Tuesday, we were studying in the library when this guy Marcus approached our table. He was in my economics class, see, and really nice. Had mentioned wanting to go to med school. He nervously asked Jessica if she wanted to grab coffee. Sometime before he was even out of earshot, she started laughing. Oh, my god, did you see his face? Why do ugly guys even bother, like, know your place? That's when I finally lost it. I closed my textbook and looked at her, dead serious. Jessica, you realize you're in the same league as these guys you keep calling ugly, right? Her face went completely white. She stared at me like I just announced I was dropping out. What did you just say to me? You heard me. You're not as attractive as you think you are. Marcus is actually a decent catch. And honestly, he's probably Too good for you. She started getting loud, which was mortifying because we were in the quiet section and everyone was staring. Are you seriously calling me ugly right now? I can't believe you just said that. I'm not calling you ugly. I'm saying you need a reality check about what you bring to the table. Friends don't say things like that to each other. Real friends tell you the truth when you need to hear it. You've been single for two years, and you constantly wonder why this is why. She grabbed her stuff and stormed out, knocking over someone's coffee cup on the way. I felt bad for about five minutes, then remembered all the genuinely nice guys she'd crushed for no reason other than her inflated ego. She texted me that night, calling me jealous and saying I was just because I was single, too. Which was funny, because I wasn't even looking to date anyone. I was focused on my nursing program. But here's where it gets interesting. Three days later, Jessica shows up to our study group all excited about this guy she met at a party. His name is Tyler, and he's premed. And so cute, she kept saying, showing us pictures on her phone.

What she knew about him destroyed my marriage. I was getting my regular Brazilian wax when my esthetician, Carla suddenly stopped mid strip and asked, does your husband have a birthmark shaped like a butterfly? I was confused how she could possibly know about the Mark on my husband Eric's lower abdomen. It was in such a private area that he joked only two people had ever seen it, me and his doctor. Carla's face had gone completely pale. She sat down on her stool and said she needed to tell me something. Last week, a man with that exact birthmark had been in for a couple's wax with his wife, Jennifer. They've been all over each other talking about their upcoming 5th anniversary trip to Cabo. Carla remembered the birthmark specifically because she'd commented on how unique it was and he'd laughed saying it was his lucky charm. My stomach dropped. Eric and I had been married for four years. He told me he was at a medical conference last week. I pulled up his Instagram and showed Carla more photos. He nodded. It was definitely him. Same voice, same laugh, same everything. But who was Jennifer? Carla pulled up their appointment history in her computer. Eric and Jennifer had been coming in monthly for the past two years for couples treatments, always paying cash, always looking under her Name. The notes showed they've been talking about their kids, two boys named Mason and Connor. Eric and I don't have children. We've been trying for a year with no success. Felt like I was going to be sick. Carla showed me Jennifer's contact info from their system. I recognized the address. It was across town in the neighborhood Eric always drove through for his shortcut to work. My hands were shaking as I searched Jennifer Martinez on Facebook. There she was with Eric and dozens of photos, two kids, a house, been a wedding album dated five years ago. I called Eric immediately, trying to sound normal. I asked him about his day and he said he was in back to back surgeries, but I could hear children laughing in the background. When I asked about the noise, he said it was just the TV in the break room and quickly hung up. I knew he was lying. Carla helped me piece together the truth. She'd been waxing both Jennifer and me for two years, never realizing we were connected. Jennifer always talked about her husband, Eric, the pediatric surgeon. I always talked about my husband, Eric, the pediatric surgeon. Same man. Two complete families, two separate lives. I drove to the address from the salon system. There was Eric's car in the driveway of a house with a swing set in the yard. Through the window, I could see him having dinner with Jennifer and two boys who Looked exactly like him. They were laughing at something on his phone, probably the text I just sent saying I love him. I didn't confront him there. Instead, I went home and searched everything. I found a second phone hidden in his golf bag with a whole other life documented in it. Five years of photos with Jennifer, birth certificates for the boys with his name, even a marriage certificate from Nevada dated a year before he married me. The investigation revealed Eric had used his position at two different hospitals to maintain separate identities. He worked part time at each telling both hospitals.

So my parents kicked me out. Now eight months later, they're begging for money. I'm a 21 year old nursing student who until recently lived at home with my parents and older sister Madison, 25. For two and a half years, I've been working weekends at a medical clinic while going to school full time, saving everything I could for my final year of nursing school and the licensing exams. So work is exhausting, but I managed to save about 50 in thousand dollars. My family has always treated Madison like she could do no wrong while I was held to impossible standards. Growing up, if Madison failed a test, it was the teacher's fault. If I got a B+, I was being lazy and disappointing them. When Madison dropped out of college after one semester because formal education stifles creativity, my parents said she was brave for following her own path. When I chose nursing over premed, they said I was settling for less and wasting my potential. Madison has been finding herself for years, jumping from one failed venture to another, photographer, life coach, yoga instructor, each lasting about three months before she got bored. My parents funded every single one without question. Her boyfriend Dylan has been around for about a year and somehow makes Madison look responsible. Comparison, he claims to be a crypto trader, but mostly just watches YouTube videos about getting Rich quick problem started three weeks ago when Madison saw me checking my banking app while paying for groceries. Two days later at dinner, she announced her latest dream coming a travel influencer. My parents were immediately supportive, asking about her content strategy and brand partnerships. Madison hadn't thought past buying a good camera and flying to Bali. Then she turned to me and said, lucky for me, my little sister has been hoarding money that could launch my career. She knew exactly how much I had saved and told our parents I had tons of money. Just sit, they're doing nothing while she needed it to invest in her future. I explained that money was for my final year of school and board exam prep courses. My mom actually said, but Madison needs it now. You can always take out loans for school like everyone else. My dad added that since I've been living rent free, the least I could do was help my sister achieve her dreams. This LED to a week of pure hell. My parents would corner me constantly saying I was selfish, that Madison had already told people about her travel blog and I was humiliating her by not supporting her. Dylan started making passive aggressive comments about how some people think they're better than their own family. The breaking point came when my parents sat me down for an intervention. They said either I give Madison at least $10,000 immediately or I needed to Find somewhere else to live. My mom actually used the words, this house doesn't have room for selfish people who don't understand family values. That night, I quietly packed my essentials, took all my important documents, changed all my passwords and left while everyone was asleep. I stayed with my friend from clinical rotations for finding a tiny apartment with three roommates. My phone wouldn't stop buzzing with messages ranging from how could you abandon your family to Madison is crying every day because of you. I kept minimal contact just letting them know I was safe. I threw myself into school and picked up extra your shifts. I started dating Ben from my pharmacology class who's been amazing through all this drama. For months, Madison kept posting about fake family and people who don't support women's dreams. Then last week, my mom called sobbing at eleven PM she could barely speak through the tears, just kept saying emergency and please come home. After I left, my parents felt guilty and.

My high school made all the boys holding their pee because someone wrote HI on the wall in Sharpie. Monday morning we all showed up to find a sign taped to the boys bathroom door. Closed until further notice due to vandalism. The girls bathroom was still open, of course, but our school only had one bathroom for boys in the entire building because it was an old school built in the 60s when they apparently thought teenage boys never needed to pee. Principal Carpenter made an announcement during first period. Due to the disrespectful graffiti found in the boys restroom, this facility will remain locked until someone comes forward with information about who did it. The entire male population of our high school groaned at the same time. The crazy part was what the graffiti actually said. My friend Peyton had seen it Friday before they locked everything up. Someone had written HIGH in tiny letters on the bathroom stall. Not a curse word, not a drawing. Just I in black Sharpie about the size of a quarter. By lunch, the situation was getting desperate. Guys were asking teachers for hall passes to go to the nurse's office just to use that bathroom. But the school nurse caught on quick and started turning people away unless they were actually sick. Some guys tried using the staff bathroom, but got detention for that. A few desperate souls walked to The gas station across the street during lunch. But security started watching for that, too. We tried talking to Principal Carpenter. Reasonably. A group of five guys went to his office to explain that punishing 300 boys for one tiny word was insane. He sat behind his big desk with his arms crossed. Actions have consequences. When the vandal comes forward, everyone gets bathroom privileges back. By Wednesday, things were getting bad. Guys were dehydrated from not drinking water all day. The basketball team couldn't practice properly because half the players were holding it in. Parents started calling to complain, but Carpenter wouldn't budge. He sent out an email saying this was a lesson in collective responsibility. That's when Dean Patterson had his brilliant idea. He was this quiet kid.

I was in Miss Brown's AP history class when the lockdown announcement crackled over. The PA, lockdown. Lockdown. This is not a drill. We've done this drill 100 times since kindergarten. Lights off, hide in the corner, stay quiet. Simple. Everyone started moving automatically. But Miss Brown stepped in front of us with that look she gets when someone questions her authority. Get back to your desks now. Her voice had that edge that meant business. I didn't approve any lockdown drill today. I raised my hand out of habit. But Miss Brown, we're supposed to. The only procedures you follow are mine. Sit down or you're all getting zeros on your presentations. Then she launched into her whole I've been teaching for 25 years speech, the one about respect and how her generation didn't need constant hand holding. Here's the thing about Miss Brown. She was one of those teachers who was super strict about weird stuff but lazy about actual teaching. She'd Mark you absent for being 30 seconds late, but give everyone A's on essays she obviously hadn't read. I once turned in a paper with a whole paragraph about SpongeBob in the middle just to test. It got a 98. So most of us sat back down. Nobody wanted to risk their GPA over what was probably just another drill. But then the announcement repeated. Code Red. This is a Code Red. All staff and students follow lockdown procedures. Immediately, that never happens in. They announced it once and that's it. My stomach started doing this weird flipping, the same feeling I get before a big test I didn't study for except worse. I kept glancing at the door. The hallway was still bright. Fluorescent lights blazing. In drills, teachers always turn off their lights and me. Then I heard it pop, pop, pop like firecrackers. But not everyone's phone started buzzing at once. I pulled mine out under my desk. My boyfriend Tyler was in chemistry two halls over. His text made my blood freeze. Hiding in supply closet. Someone has a gum. Where are you? More texts putting in behind filing cabinet and main office. Under Mister Garcia's desk, I showed Miss Brown my phone. My boyfriend says there's someone with a. I see what's happening here. You think you can stage some elaborate prank to get me in trouble? Get me fired. The popping sounds were getting louder, closer. Someone screamed in the hallway. Not a fun scream, not a playing around scream. That's probably drama class practicing, Miss Brown said. But even she didn't sound sure anymore. I could see Mister Peterson's class across the hall. Lights off, no movement, just dark. This where 20 kids should have been. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely type. Henderson won't let us hide. Still at desks. Tyler, what? Get to safety now. Ben tried next. Sweet Ben who never argued with anyone. Miss Brown Please, this feels real. Feelings aren't facts. Ben, sit down. More running in the hallway. Lots of feet, all going the same direction, away from something or someone. The PA crackled again but cut off mid word. That's when we heard the shots. Not pops anymore. Bang, bang, bang, like someone slamming a metal door, but sharper, louder, real. I stood up. We need to hide now. Sit down or you're expelled. Miss Brown moved to block a light switch. I will not lose my job because you children want to play games. Something in me snapped. I don't care. I sprinted for the lights. That's when everyone lost it. Half the class rushed to the safe corner. The other half froze at their desks, torn between a lifetime of following rules and that primal voice screaming danger. Miss Brown grabbed at my arm as I passed, but I yanked away. She was yelling about disrespect and consequences. You're all being hysterical. This paranoia is exactly what social media has done to you. Manufactured fear. But we weren't listening anymore. Desks to cross, linoleum. As we barricaded the door, someone was crying. Someone else was praying. The kids who'd frozen finally scrambled over, cramming into our corner, 23 teenagers trying to become invisible. Everyone except Miss Brown. She stood at her desk, arms crossed, fury radiating off her. The doorknob rattled. Everyone stopped breathing. The handle turned locked. Thank god, locked. A shadow passed under the door. Pause. We could Hear breathing on the other side or maybe that was just my heart pounding in my ears. Footsteps.

And they'd be talking about how someone got chased by a goose at school or how someone's Airpod fell in the toilet at work. It had its own inside jokes, its own emoji rules, even a custom name like the Goofy Squad or the Meatball Mafia or some weird thing that made no sense. Unless you were there since day one. And don't get me started on the chaos at 2:00am. That's when the weirdest topics would show up.

All you see is such and such left the chat propane and you try to revive it like, yo, remember when such and such said that one thing about the cafeteria? Crickets. Not even a like.

I'm 22, Alex is 23 and we've been roommates for a year. I've always been cool with gay people, had a gay friend in high school, never bothered me. Alex and I became close friends pretty quick. We'd watch movies together, cook dinner, joke around constantly. He's honestly one of the funniest people I know and we have this weird chemistry where we can talk for hours about absolutely nothing. But recently when Alex brings guys over, I get this weird angry feeling in my chest that I can't explain. It started about three months ago when I came home early from work and saw him making out with some tall athletic guy on our couch. They were really going at it and I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach. I wanted to punch something, which made absolutely no sense. I mumbled an awkward apology and locked myself in my room for the rest of the night blasting music to drown out any sounds. Since then, every single time he has a date over, I become this bitter cold version of myself that I don't even recognize. I'll give his dates dirty looks when they walk in, make sarcastic comments under my breath are just disappeared to my room and blast music until they leave. One guy tried to politely Introduce himself in our kitchen and I literally just walked past him like he didn't exist. Another time I came home and saw Alex cuddling with someone while watching Netflix and I made such a loud, dramatic entrance that they both jumped apart. Alex started noticing my attitude and it was seriously affecting our friendship. We went from hanging out every single night, cooking together and having our stupid inside jokes to barely speak into each other. The apartment felt tense and uncomfortable all the time. Last week, he finally confronted me in our kitchen while I was aggressively washing dishes after another one of his dates had just left. Dude, seriously, what's your problem? You've been a complete jerk to every guy I bring over. I couldn't look at him. Just kept scrubbing the same plate over and over. I don't have a problem. That's bullshit and you know it. You're acting like I'm doing something wrong by dating people. I finally turned around feeling frustrated and cornered. I'm not homophobic if that's what you're thinking. His face softened a little. I never said you were homophobic, but something's clearly bothering you and it's making things weird between us. I couldn't explain the rage I felt seeing him with other people, this sick, jealous feeling that made no sense. So I just said I was stressed about work and walked away from the conversation. Then my mom came to visit for the weekend. She met Alex and instantly loved Him. They spent out or is talking while I was at work, bonding over cooking shows and sharing embarrassing stories about me. That Sunday night after some of his friends stopped by to hang out, she pulled me aside in my room with this knowing look on her face. Honey, that boy is absolutely head over heels for you. I laughed nervously, mom, he's gay and I'm straight. We're just roommates and friends. She gave me that look mothers have when they know something you don't trust me. I know what pining looks like. I've been watching people fall in love for 50 years. The way he talks about you, remembers every little thing you like, lights up when you walk in the room. You're not just his roommate to him, sweetie, that's ridiculous, mom. And you, she continued, crossing her arms, are acting exactly like a jealous boyfriend. All that anger when he brings dates home, that's not homophobic.

You didn't know? I was walking down the street when these two girls I've never seen before called my name. Ryan, this is super weird, but our best friend's baby shower is happening right now. Can you please pretend to be her boyfriend and the father? I did a double take. They looked so desperate. Her ex is insane. He tried to burn their house down while she was in. He's gonna show up at some point, and we need someone who can scare him off. I'm 6 feet 4 inches and apparently look like I eat nails for breakfast, so I get why they picked me, but this was insane. How do you even know my name? Your gym bag, one said, pointing at the tag. Please. He said he's coming at three PM to reclaim what's his. It's 2:15. Against every logical thought, I followed them into this house covered in pink balloons and baby girl banners. The living room was packed with women who all turned to stare at me. Then I saw her. Becky from my comparative lit class sophomore year. The girl I'd spent an entire semester trying to work up the courage to talk to. Now eight months pregnant, looking exhausted. It seemed like the worst joke the universe has ever played. Everyone, this is Ryan. The girls announced the father. Becky's eyes went wide, recognizing me, but she played along. Hey, babe, she said weakly. Her friend pulled me aside. Richard's been sending videos all morning. He's unhinged. Just stand there and look protective until he shows up and leaves. I stood by Becky's chair while she opened presents. The party tried to feel normal, but everyone was tense. Her phone buzzed. She showed me a video from Richard on my way to get what's mine. Hope you didn't think you could replace me. This is the sixth one today, Becky whispered. An older woman, maybe an aunt, said quietly to another guest. Remember when Richard threw that bottle at her head at Christmas? Becky's mom approached me. Thank you for doing this. Last time he showed up somewhere, he broke her friend's nose for interfering. Another video came through at 2:30. Richard in his truck. Tell everyone to clear out unless they want problems. The room got quieter. People kept glancing at the windows. At 2:40, another text. Nice pink decorations. Almost there. A friend mentioned he knows which house he's probably driving by. Becky tried to focus on opening a baby onesie. Her hands were shaking. Last time he came to a party, someone whispered, four people went to the ER. At 2:50, Becky's phone rang. She put it on. Speak

So I left my fiance. Bianca and I were discussing wedding plans when she casually mentioned, once we're married, my student loan becomes our problem to solve together. I knew she had loans, but she'd always been vague about specifics. How much are we talking about, I asked. She shifted uncomfortably. 87,000. I nearly spit out my coffee but stayed calm. I'm an accountant. I solve financial problems for a living. What's your payment? And she'd been on income based repayment for four years, paying $200 a month. Quick math told me she was actually going backwards. Started at 83,000, now at 87. She was basically is feeding the interest monster. Let's look at your budget together, I suggested. Her face went blank. Budget. Turns out Bianca making 52,000 a year had no idea where her money went. Two hours later, I had the full picture. BMW payment, $580. Boutique gym, 189. Regular gym, 45. She kept both. Shopping 12 monthly, eating out, 800. Starbucks alone, 240. She was actually going deeper into debt each month, floating on credit cards. I spent 3 days creating a comprehensive plan with spreadsheets and projections. If we're aggressive, we can be debt free in 4 years, I presented. She perked up. Amazing how. 1st, sell the BM w, you owe 28,000, it's worth 30. Take that difference plus savings. Buy a reliable beat up Honda for 8,000 Eliminates the monthly payment. Her smile vanished. Sell my car. It's eating 20% of your income. But I love my car. You also love being debt free, right? I guess. Next, cancel redundant memberships and subscription boxes. That's 659 monthly. Those aren't redundant. Boutique gym is for classes. Regular gym for weights. Can't you do weights at the boutique gym? That's not the point. Shopping budget goes to 200 for necessities, 200 for everything. What about clothes and makeup? That's what the 200 is for. This is insane. You want me to live like a peasant? What about your sacrifices? She demanded. I pulled up another slide. I'm canceling golf, selling my gaming console, putting my entire bonus toward the loans. Also suggesting we postpone the big wedding to courthouse now party later. She exploded. You're trying to control me. This is financial abuse. This is math, Bianca. You have 98,000 in debt, making 50 2,000 a year. My friends don't live like this. Your friends probably don't have six figures in debt. She stormed out to her friend's house. Next day she came back with a compromise. She cancel meal delivery and reduce eating out from 800 to 600 monthly. That's still $20 a day for eating out. I pointed out I have work lunches, networking every single day. Then her mom called telling me I was unreasonable for expecting her daughter to sell her BMW. That car is part of her image. You can't expect to drive some Beater. A reliable used car isn't a beater. You men want a princess but won't pay for the yucky. I hung up. The breaking point came when Bianca suggested I get a second job to pay more toward her loans while she changed nothing. You want me to work two jobs while you keep your BMW? It would.

I was in Mister Aneta's history class when the announcement came over the intercom. Code red! Code red! This is not a drill. Everyone froze. We practiced this 100 times. Lock the door. Turn off the lights. Hide in the corner. Mister Wienetta immediately jumped up and reached for the door lock. Then Vice Principal Medina's voice boomed through the speaker. False alarm, everyone. Some prankster called in a fake threat. Continue with your lessons. Do not lock your doors. I repeat, do not initiate lockdown procedures. Mister Wienetta hesitated with his hand on the lock. My friend Maddie whispered from her desk. But I said, Code Red! That's the real signal. Mister Arnetta looked confused. The VP says it's fake, though. Then we heard it. Footsteps running down the hallway. Not walking. Running hard and fast. Like someone was being chased. Mister Medina's voice came back on. Teachers. I said, continue teaching. Any classroom that locks their door will have their teacher written up for insubordination. Mister Arnetta slowly backed away from the door. He looked scared, but sat back his desk. Everyone stay calm. Let's continue with the lesson. Sweat was dripping from his forehead and nobody could focus. The running footsteps kept happening. First on our floor, then above us, and back again. I put pulled out my phone and opened our school's parent Facebook group. My mom had posted that police were surrounding the School. They told us someone called about a weapon. She spammed my phone, saying she loves me. My hands started shaking. I showed Maddie the post. Her face went white. She raised her hand. Mister Renata, my mom says the police are outside. Mister Renata walked to the window and peeked through the blinds. He gasped loudly. There were 6 police cars in the parking lot. Mister Medina came on again. Students, ignore any social media posts. This is a routine false alarm. Any student caught on their phone will receive immediate suspension. Any teacher who initiates lockdown will be terminated. I saw Mister Aneta's jaw clench. We could hear doors slamming somewhere in the building. Not closing, slamming. Like someone was checking rooms. Then we heard something that made everyone freeze. The fire exit at the end of our hallway opened and slammed shut. Someone was on our floor. Maddie grabbed my arm so tight it hurt. The footsteps were getting closer, classroom by classroom. Mr. Grenada stood up and walked toward the door again. But he stopped. He looked at us and at the door. And back at us. The footsteps stopped right outside our room. That's when Pete, the quiet kid who never talked, he grabbed his desk and started dragging it toward the door. Mister Anetta, help me now! Mister Anetta snapped out of it. What are you doing? Pete didn't stop. My dad's a cop. He said if we ever hear Code Red, we lock Down! No matter what anyone says, even the principal. The doorknob started to turn. Everyone moved at once. Kids grabbed desks and chairs and shoved them against the door. Mr. Arbeneta finally joined us. Lights! Someone get the lights! Maddie, hit the switch. We pushed everything we could find against that door. The person outside pushed hard. The door opened a crack, but hit our barricade. They pushed harder. Mr. Medina's voice screamed through the intercom. Which classroom is refusing to follow directions? You will all be expelled! But we didn't care about his threats anymore. The person outside kicked the door. The whole barricade shook. Some girls started crying. Pete pointed to the back corner. Everyone get down! Stay quiet! We huddled together in the darkness. The kicking got more violent. And suddenly it stopped. We heard the footsteps. Move to the next class.

In school, my sociology teacher brought in homemade banana bread for our class, but she put a deathly ingredient inside it. She was that kind of teacher who always wore floral dresses and complained about how kids these days had no respect. The whole class got excited when she pulled out this big Tupperware container full of thick slices wrapped in plastic wrap. I was starving since I'd skipped breakfast that morning. She started passing out the slices, and when mine landed on my desk, I immediately unwrapped it. The bread genuinely looked amazing. But when I brought it up to take a bite, something hit me, this weird smell underneath the sweet banana scent. My stomach twisted because I recognized that smell, avocado. Mrs. Sutton, I raised my hand while everyone else was already chewing. Is there avocado in this? She looked at me over her reading glasses. No, dear. Just eat it. It's delicious. But that smell was still there, faint but definitely there. I'm deathly allergic to avocados. Like throat closing, can't breathe, need an ambulance. Allergic. My mom had drilled it into my head since I was 5 years old to always check ingredients. Are you sure? Because I'm really allergic and I think I smell. I said, there's no avocado. Her voice got sharp. Just eat the bread. I spent three hours making it. Last night, after grading all your essays, the guilt hit me hard. She had stayed Up late baking for us after reading 30 essays about the social aspects of cancel culture. Everyone was staring at me. Now some kids were already on their second piece, but that smell was still there, making my nose go in that specific way that only happened around avocados. I'm really sorry, but I can't eat this if there's any chance. Slam. Mrs. Sutton's hand hit the whiteboard so hard it called her Mommy. You need to be grateful, young lady. I went out of my way to do something nice and this is how you act. My face burned. Everyone was definitely staring. Now. This is what's wrong with your generation. Her face had turned red and she was waving her arms around. Everything is an allergy or anxiety or some made up condition. You all need trigger warnings and safe space. Back in my day, we ate what we were given and said thank you. Nobody had all these fake allergies. It's because you're all so cuddled and weak. You're allergic to avocado. Please. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. You probably read about it online and decided you had it too. Just like how everyone suddenly has ADHD and depression. It's all for attention. I felt tears building up. I tried convincing myself maybe I was being dramatic. Maybe it wasn't avocado and my mind was playing tricks on me. The whole class was silent now watching this lay out Tommy, who sat next to Me had stopped mid chew. Missus Sutton crossed her arms. Well, are you going to eat it or are you going to continue insulting my baking? My hands shook as I picked up bread. She was so sure she was an adult and a teacher. She wouldn't lie to me about something that could hurt me, would she? I thought about my mom always telling me to trust my instincts. But Missus Sutton was glaring at me like I was the worst student she'd ever had. I took a bite. The bread was actually really good, sweet and moist with a hint of cinnamon. I swallowed and waited. Maybe I had been wrong. Maybe it was just some weird banana type that smelled different. Missus Sutton smiled.

My younger sister, Ariana, turned into a homewrecker the moment my husband Kevin slipped the ring on my finger and started a desperate pick me routine. If Kevin were blue, she'd show up in blue. If you mention liking something, she'd become an expert overnight. If you posted about a restaurant, she coincidentally appeared during our date. It started subtle, almost innocent, even, like city next to Kevin. At every family dinner, Ariana would squeeze between us, claiming she couldn't hear from the other end. I didn't mind, since family is family. But after six months, it got obvious. Kevin joined a gym near his office. Ariana got a membership there the next day, showing up during his workout times in tiny sports bras. Kevin mentioned liking astronomy once. Suddenly, Ariana was texting him NASA articles daily, asking, can you explain this to me? Then came the fake emergencies. Her car broke down near Kevin's office. Her apartment had a gas leak. When I was out of town, she needed help moving heavy boxes that turned out to be empty. Kevin always told me immediately, showing me her texts, eye rolls. She's just young and confused, he'd say, and I agreed. Until she officially went too far. A hard knock at 9:00am, and there stood Ariana in a tiny white sundress, full makeup, hair curled like a magazine shoot. I need Kevin's help moving furniture, she announced, pushing past me. Where is he? But we both knew she lived in a furnished apartment. I was about to tell her to leave when she added, I'm sure you have errands to run. You can go away now. She was literally trying to dismiss me from my own home. Kevin came downstairs and she immediately grabbed his arm. Oh, perfect. You're already dressed. I promise I'll return him in one piece. She actually winked at me. I felt my chest burn with rage, but then had a different thought. I headed upstairs, loudly saying, I need to take a bath. But I didn't leave or go to the bathroom. I stayed upstairs where I could hear everything through the vents. Didn't waste any time. Oh my God, Kevin, you're so muscular! She giggled, clearly touching his arm. Do you work out every day? I bet you could lift me with one hand. Wanna try? I rolled my eyes. This girl had zero shame. I kept folding laundry, waiting for Kevin's polite deflection. Instead, I heard him say, seriously, Ariana, can I tell you something important? My heart sank. Oh, god, here we

Yeah, he did more than ask about you. He emailed us to call you. Really? What did he say? Oh, my God. He said, yeah, your voice is getting that high pitch thing, which is always a good thing when you talk about boys and you're a woman. Yeah, it sounds weird to say talk about boys and you're a woman. I don't know. Talk about men and you're a woman. That works for me. I don't know. Anyway, uh, males and you're female. Sorry, Susie. Um, wait, no. So tell me, what did Vic say? Well, he said that he liked you a lot and that he, okay, had your phone number because you guys texted back and forth a picture or something. And he wanted to call to ask you out, but he wasn't sure how to do that. So he emailed us to do it instead. Cause I guess that's less weird. Oh, well, that's kind of sweet. Oh my gosh. I was thinking to text him too, but I thought it would be kind of weird. Okay, wait, before we get any further, are you still talking to Scott, who you actually went out on a date with? I mean, he texted me a few times, but I don't know. I just, he's just really not my type. So I haven't really responded. So, okay, let me just tell you what Vic told us. Vic told us that, you know, He showed up and it was awkward or whatever, he says that he felt like you were flirting with him the whole time while you were out with his coworker. Is that true? Sounds like it's true. Well, I don't think it was the whole time. Okay, dude, if you were flirting with any man that was dressed as a clown for any amount of time, I feel like that means that you must like him a lot because clowns are not easy to be attracted to unless you have a clown fetish. Susan, do you have a clown fetish? No. No. He was really cute. He wasn't wearing the nose or anything. Oh, my God. You sound excited. Um, I don't know. I just, I had a really good time. Um, and if you talk to him, could you tell him my mashed potatoes were running? Your mashed potatoes were running. Yes. What does that mean? I don't know. What do I mean? Hold up. It was just like an inside joke between us. Could you tell him that? Sure. Susan, shouldn't you tell him like you'd like to see him again or something, not your mashed potatoes were running. Yeah, I just, I just want him to know because we were talking about it for a while. So he'll get it. He'll get it. It's funny. Okay. Well, hey, Susan, hang on. Hang on. Let's see if he gets it. Hey, Vic, her mashed potatoes are ready.

Oh, okay, so you got the whole awkward seeing each other naked part out of the way on the first night, then. That's a good strategy. What is the girl's name? Uh, her name is Lisa. Okay, so you and Lisa hooked up, but that turned into dating? Yeah, but, like, here's the. Here's the thing. Every time we went out, she gets dropped off by an Uber. So I just kind of finally started offering to take her home if she wanted. And both times she was like, can you just drop me off at a friend's apartment? I'm supposed to hang out with her tonight, type of thing. And I'm like, so she. Okay, so she Uber's to you, and she gets dropped off at the end of the day at a friend's place? Yeah. So she's married? Yes. How did you know that? Well, she doesn't want you to see where she lives. And she slept with you the first night you met her. It sounds like a cheating wife to me. Like, that's not all. So one night, I asked if we could go back to her place, and she's like, there's something I need to tell you. Please don't freak out. I'm technically married. Technically. Technically. I like how she put that. I'm technically married. That's like usher saying I technically just gave you herpes. Yeah, so I asked her. I said, um, if you're married, what are you doing out with me? And she's like, well, my husband and I have an open marriage. He doesn't have a problem with it. That's probably a lie, too. Yeah, well, I mean, that's why I called you guys. You guys think she's lying? Well, have you ever met her husband? No, definitely not. Okay, but she says no, it's cool if. Because we have an open marriage. Correct. Ask to meet her husband so that you can hear him say it. Well, that's what I was kind of hoping you guys could, uh. Could do. Oh, so you. Okay, so you want us to find out if her marriage is really open or if it's the other kind of marriage, you know, like normal people do? Exactly. Okay, but I have a question. So say their marriage is an open marriage. Are you okay with being in that type of situation? Not really. But it's like, with this girl. I don't know. I just, I. I can't even describe the things she does without getting in trouble. Like, if I told you, I would get kicked off the radio. Oh. Oh, okay. Okay, so this girl completely blows your mind? Among other things. So for you, it wouldn't matter that she was still married? I mean, it wouldn't matter if. If. If what she said was true. Okay, but you're Not sure it is, no. Okay, I'm betting you, like, a hundred bucks that she's lying to you and we're gonna get this husband on the phone and he's just gonna be like, um, open marriage? Yeah. What? Well, hold on. I have an idea. Why don't we try to get them both on the phone at the same time, so you'll have them both on, and then you can come in and be like, so your wife says you have an open marriage. What's that? Like, you wanna do that? Uh, that's. That's fine with me if you. If you think you can do it. God, I hope so, because that would be the most awkward thing in the world to hear when she's on the line and then he's on the line and we're like, so about that open marriage. So. Okay, I have a plan forming, so let's talk during this break, and then we come back, we're gonna make it happen. What we're attempting to do is we're trying to get her on the phone. Her name is Lisa. We're gonna try to get Lisa on the phone, but we're also trying to get her husband on the phone at the same time. And then we're gonna ask, so you're in an open marriage, right? And your husband's cool with it? And if the husband is on the phone, do you think she'll tell the truth, or do you think she'll be like, um, I think She'll tell the truth. I think she's gonna get caught with her pants down and I think this is. I think she's gonna like it. I think. Yeah, she will. Obviously. I think this is about to be the most awkward thing we've done. I guess I should say I hope she tells the truth. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So, alright, so now here's the other problem. We don't have her husband's phone number. Right. So we gotta figure out a way to get that. Let's call up Lisa first.

My first month at my new job, this girl from my department promised me $1,000 if I could be her fiance for three months. I thought it was a prank. Renee was the girl in the office that made managers forget about their wives. I was the new guy who only spoke to people about code. But then she explained that her hated cousin's wedding was in 90 days, and she needed someone tall and handsome so her family would stop pressuring her to find someone. What she conveniently forgot to mention is that the cousin getting married was Sasha. Sasha's cousin, my ex, who had left me for my best friend. And we drew up an actual contract on my laptop right there. No kissing. Hand holding only when necessary. We'd break up a week after the wedding, and we'd split any cash gifts. Sixty, forty. Since she was paying me, she made me proud. Practice my boyfriend voice in the supply closet. You sound like you're reading a hostage note, she said, fixing my collar. I had to practice calling her babe without cringing. Rehearse how we met until our story was bulletproof. She taught me her dad liked football and her mom would judge my shoes. The first time I met her parents, I said, we met at a conference while she said, coffee shop. Her mom's eyebrow raised exactly 1 millimeter, but her dad laughed and said, can't Keep your story straight. Must be true love. They grilled me for hours. I left with them believing I owned a ranch back in Canada. They made a show of kissing my cheek on the way out. Very theatrical. Very fake. But then two weeks in, things started shifting suddenly. At work, we kept our distance. Separate lunch breaks, minimal interaction. But she started bringing me coffee without asking. Just left it on my desk with a, you know, for the performance tonight. Oat milk latte, extra shot. Which I never told her. The family dinners were exhausting at first. All performance, hand holding that felt like a business handshake, practiced smiles. But by the third dinner, I wasn't checking my watch anymore. Her dad and I actually talked football. Her mom taught me recipes while Renee watched with this unreadable expression. Family game night changed everything. When we destroyed her siblings at charades, her dad pulled me aside. I've never seen her this comfortable with someone. That night in the car, Renee was quiet. Sorry, she said suddenly. For what I asked. Just all of this. Everything I'm putting you through. I thought she meant the fake relationship. Looking back, she was apologizing for what was coming. Our text conversations involved too. First, just logistics. Dinner at 7, Blue? Sure. Then she text after family events. You did good tonight. Then random thoughts at midnight. Then you awake at 2:00am. Followed by 40 messages about co workers, movies, anything. She mentioned my idiot ex who fumbled. The best guy ever, and I tense up. Seriously, who cheats on someone that amazing? She'd push, watching my reaction. Some people make mistakes, I'd mumble, and she'd look away, guilty about something I didn't understand. Yet. One night at the office, both staying late, we finally acknowledged it. This is getting complicated, I said. It's just method acting, she insisted, but her hands were shaking. Renee, you brought me soup when I was sick last week. That wasn't for your family. She stood up, frustrated. So what if I care? We need to stick to the contract, I said weakly. Right. She agreed. But her nephew's birthday party was when pretending became impossible. I did Dinosaur voices to make him laugh, and when I looked up, Renee was staring at me like I'd solved world hunger. Other moms kept asking how long we've been together? And she'd get this soft look. The cake tasting was what broke us both. She started sobbing over chocolate versus vanilla, but I couldn't understand why. I held her in the parking lot while she ugly cried into my shirt. I'm so sorry, Alan. I'm so, so sorry. It's not your fault, I said. Yes, it is, she whispered. And no matter what I said, she refused to feel less guilty. Pretending to care about you is killing me, I find. Only admitted one night, she looked like she might cry. Alan, there's something. I perked up. But then she couldn't bring herself to say it. After the wedding, she said, we'll talk after the wedding. That's when it happened. The rehearsal dinner was the first time I would meet her cousin, the bride. I walked in confident, her hand in mine, ready to charm great aunts and distant cousins. I had been genuinely looking forward to it, just to spend more time with Renee. But then I saw

Okay, E, what can we do for you on this dirty work Wednesday? Okay, so you know how sometimes you guys like, call like two people at the same time, but there's really a third person on the line too? Like, and it's a total surprise? Yeah, like a Three Way call. Yeah. Well, yeah, I need you to do that. Okay, so who are we calling and why? Okay, so like, I work in a big office and I don't want to say where cause I'm skipping work today to do this, so. Oh wow. Okay, so you're. So you're skipping work so you can call dirty work Wednesday? Dude, I'm desperate. Okay, go ahead. Okay, like, so in this office, there's a bunch of people, and I'm friends with most of them. And one of the guys I'm friends with is Ryan. He works in IT. He's a. He's a really nice guy, but he's got the biggest crush on one of our co workers named Katrina. Okay, so Brian likes Katrina. Brian loves Katrina, okay? Loves her. But the problem is he's like zero self confidence. So instead of actually telling her anything, he leaves her these little anonymous gifts and surprises at her desk. Like one day it's flowers or a writer a poem. And get her coffee from Starbucks. But she doesn't know where it all comes from. In fact, Nobody does. Well, you do. Well, yeah, I'm pretty much the only person he opens up to, so. So me and him are the only ones that know. And I tell him all the time to just talk to her, but he won't do it. It's almost like he's catfishing her, but without making up a fake person. Okay, so how long has this been going on? It's been going since Christmas. I mean, it started Christmas. He got her this little Monet calendar for her desk, cause I guess she likes Monet or something. So this has been going on for six months, then? Wow. Okay, so what do you need us to do? So what I wanna do, I wanna talk to him and once again, try to tell him to just tell Katrina how he feels. But I thought you could have her listening, you know, on the other line, so when we talk about it, she can hear what's going on. Then finally she'll know the truth, and you won't have to keep, like. Yeah, I don't know, man. This sounds like a bad idea. I mean, is there. Is there a reason he hasn't told her already? I mean, like I said, he gets, like, zero self confidence. He works in IT, so he's like, kind of nerdy, but not like dorky nerdy. He's just. He's just smart. Just a smart guy, you know? He's a little overweight. Not like gross overweight or anything. Okay, Well, I mean, what happens, like, if we get her on the phone and then she hears it's Brian and she rejects him? I mean, have you thought about that? Yeah, I have, but we gotta do this now. It's now or never. Okay, why after six months does it have to happen now? Cause there's the guy. Can I swear? Yeah, go ahead. There's a total head in our building named Decker, and he asked her out on Monday. Now, this guy is a complete D bag, and all he's gonna do is date her, try to get in her pants, and brag to his D bag friends here at work about it, and then just dump her. Okay, so we gotta do this now, or else she ends up with Decker, the D bag. Exactly. Eric, how hot is this Katrina girl? Like, on a scale from 1 to 10? I mean, she's pretty hot. Everyone here at work dresses up. Still at work, she's like a 9. I don't know what she's like at home. And sweatpants. Okay, so you would be willing to risk your entire friendship with Brian to put him on the spot like this, expose this secret love he has, and then pray to Jesus that she thinks he's dateable? Yeah, I would. Okay, and just so you know, if she rejects him, it's all out on the air, like, making it 10 times worse for him. Like I said, I got no Choice. Okay, well, this is. This is either going to be amazing radio or what I imagine the Hindenburg sounded like when it exploded. But either way, it's coming up next.

My boss, Rachel, is basically the coolest person at our advertising agency. Last month, she sent out the group text about her party on Friday night. Everyone was hyped, talking about it during lunch breaks, planning what to wear, the whole thing. But I never got the text. Figured maybe she just forgot to add me. Or maybe my phone was being weird. Thursday rolls around, and I'm hearing more party talk. People are discussing who's bringing what drinks, and someone mentioned the karaoke machine. I'm starting to feel pretty left out, but I don't wanna seem desperate by asking about it. Friday afternoon comes, and everyone's buzzing about getting ready after work. That's when I finally worked up the courage to walk into Rachel's office. I knocked on her door, and she looked up with this bright smile. Hey, what's up? She said. I took a deep breath. So, um. I think there might have been a mix up. I didn't get the text about tonight's party. Her face immediately changed, like all the colour just drained out of it. She stared at me for what felt like forever before clearing her throat. Oh, right about that, she started fidgeting with her pen. The thing is, this party is more of a core team event. Core team? I've been there for two years. I worked overtime constantly and never complained. I brought doughnuts every Friday and covered For people when they were sick. What do you mean, core team? I asked. She couldn't even look at me. Well, you know, people who are more central to the office dynamic. That hit me like a punch to the gut. I just nodded and walked out. The whole office cleared out at five sharp, and I sat there alone, pretending to work, while everyone else headed to have fun without me. But here's where it gets interesting. Around 9 that night, I get a call from my friend Jamie, who works in accounting. She's whispering and sounds panicked. Dude, you need to check Rachel's Instagram story, like, right now. I open Instagram, and there's Rachel's story from the party. Everyone's having a blast, dancing, playing beer pong. But in the background of one video, I see

My math teacher thought I didn't speak Spanish. Big mistake. I was born in California, but my parents came from Colombia. When they were teenagers, at home, we spoke Spanish every single day. My mom would cook while telling me stories about her childhood in Bogota. My dad would watch soccer games and yell at the TV in Spanish. But at school, I always spoke English. It just felt more natural with my friends. Miss Graham was new to our school district. She transferred from some rural area upstate where apparently nobody looked like me. From Day 1, she made comments about the diversity programs and how standards were dropping, but she said it quietly, thinking none of us understood. During my second week in her algebra class, I was presenting a group project about linear equations. I made a small error while explaining one of the steps. No big deal happens to everyone. But Miss Graham leaned over to the teaching assistant and whispered in Spanish, Otra parete suosa suhenten nunkas es fuerza. Another lazy one. Her people never try hard. I froze. Did this woman really just call me lazy in Spanish right in front of me? I kept my face neutral and pretended I didn't understand, but inside I was furious. The worst part was she had this smug smile like she'd gotten away with something clever. I went home that night and told my mom everything. My mom works. Two jobs, cleaning offices at night and doing alterations during the day. She doesn't take disrespect from anybody, especially not some teacher insulting her daughter. But instead of marching to the principal's office like I expected, she sat down at our kitchen table and started planning me how we're going to be smart about this. She said, keep track of everything. She says, write it down with dates and times. And whatever you do, don't let her know you speak Spanish. For the next two weeks, I played completely dumb in math class. Miss Graham kept making comments in Spanish, thinking she was safe. She called me and other Hispanic students lazy, said our parents probably didn't care about education, even joke to the ta that we probably drop out anyway. Documented everything in a notebook word for word. The parent teacher conferences were scheduled for a Thursday evening. My mom took off work early, which was a big deal because she needed every hour. We walked into that classroom together and Miss Graham immediately got that condescending look teachers get when they think they're dealing with parents who don't speak English. Ah, we might need to call for a translator, Miss Graham said to the assistant principal who was also in the room for these meetings. She said it slowly and loudly like volume would help us understand better. That's when I cut in. Speaking perfect Spanish, actually, Miss Graham.

My dad always made it super clear that I was his least favorite kid. When I was 8, my mom left and he got stuck raising me. That's when he met Rebecca and her two kids, Tyler and Jess. He moved us all in together and suddenly I went from being his only child to being the unwanted baggage. Tyler was perfect at everything, football captain, straight A's, full scholarship to state. Jess was daddy's little princess who could do no wrong. Meanwhile, I was just the kid who reminded him of his first marriage failure. Every family dinner was Tyler talking about his latest achievements while dad beamed like he'd won the lottery. Jess would show him her art projects and he'd hang them on the fridge with little heart magnets. When I brought home my honor roll certificate at sophomore year, he glanced at it for two seconds and said, good job, sport, without even looking up from his phone. The worst part was how he'd introduce us to people. This is my son, Tyler. He's going to state on a football scholarship. And my daughter, Jess, she's so artistic. Then he'd pause and add, oh, and this is Jake. Just Jake. Like I was some random kid who happened to live there. Money was always tight, but somehow Tyler always got new cleats. And Jess got her art supplies. When I needed new shoes for cross country, dad said the old ones had plenty of life left. They were held together with duct tape. Rebecca tried to stick up for me sometimes, but dad would just say I needed to learn the value of hard work. Senior year came and I was actually doing pretty well. I'd gotten into three colleges and even landed a small academic scholarship. I was excited to tell him, thinking maybe this would be the thing that made him proud. I found him in the garage working on Tyler's car and told him about the acceptance letters. He nodded and said, that's nice, buddy. Then asked if I could hand him a wrench. That night at dinner, Tyler announced he'd been named team captain for state's freshman squad. Dad literally stood up and clapped. He pulled out his wallet and handed Tyler $200 for Celebration dinner with his girlfriend. I looked at Jess and she rolled her eyes. Even she thought it was too much.

So my dad has this mouth like a sailor. Every other word out of his mouth is some form of curse word. He drops F bombs at breakfast, calls drivers idiots when we're in the car, and basically swears more than anyone I know. It's been like this my whole life. Last week I'm in the kitchen making a sandwich and I dropped the Mayo jar. It smashes everywhere and I go, oh, shit, not again. Pretty normal reaction. Action, right? Wrong. My dad comes storming in like I just committed murder. Watch your language, young lady. I don't want to hear that garbage coming out of your mouth again. I just stared at him. This is the same guy who stubbed his toe yesterday and yelled son of a bitch, bastard, piece of shit table loud enough for the neighbors to hear. But somehow me saying shit once is crossing the line. Are you serious right now, dad? Dead serious. You're better than that. That's when I got the idea. If you wanted to please my language, fine. But fair is fair. Okay, dad, you're right. Swearing is bad. So let's all stop starting now. Anyone who swears in this house pays $5 into a jar. Family swear tax. He laughed like it was a joke. Sure, honey, whatever makes you happy. I grabbed an empty pickle jar from the recycling and Wrote swear jar on it with a Sharpie, put it right on the kitchen counter where everyone could see it. Day one was amazing. Dad walks into the kitchen that morning, sees the coffee pot is empty.

My mom, because nothing says welcome home like you've gained weight, being the first words out of her mouth. I laughed and told her she was seeing things. But that night when my scale hit 160 pounds, 15 more than my usual 145, I realized the dryer hadn't been shrinking my jeans and my mom's eyes worked perfectly fine. I should have known something was seriously wrong three weeks later when Sarah had to help me squeeze into my backup shirt for girls night because my favorite top wouldn't zip. Maybe it shrunk. She offered. We both knew clothes don't shrink that much. By the next month, the scale read 168 and nothing in my closet fit. My cousin's wedding was in six weeks and I'd already bought the dress. So I discovered my survival strategy, fruit adventure, Tik Toks, zero calories to keep my mouth busy while I basically stopped eating until this nightmare ended. The wedding dress disaster changed everything because when I had to buy one two sizes bigger, I knew something was medically wrong. My doctor weighed me at 175 pounds, 30 pounds heavier in just four months, and immediately ordered every test imaginable, thyroid hormone hormones, cortisol, insulin. Three days later, her nurse called with this weird, hesitant voice saying the doctor wanted to see me immediately instead of next week. And when I asked what was wrong, she paused way too Long before saying the doctor would explain, the whole office acted strange when I arrived, like they'd seen my results and didn't know what to say. Here's where things got absolutely insane because the doctor spread out my test results like she was looking for Waldo. And everything was completely normal. Thyroid hormones, insulin, cortisol, all of it perfect. Yet he kept flipping through pages asking about my diet. I told her I basically stopped eating, just living on salads and these zero calorie Tic Tacs I was shaking in my hand. But she didn't even glance at them. Instead, she started throwing out random conditions like lipodemia, metabolic syndrome and Cushings. But every test came back normal. When she accused me of secret eating, I lost it because I was literally starving myself and still gaining weight. The endocrinologist she referred me to was equally baffled after running more tests for growth hormone, leptin, grelin, even tumors. And his exact words were, your blood work is perfect, too. Perfect for someone who gained 30 pounds in four months. He asked about family history. But my mom's been the same size since the 90s. So by this point, I was eating maybe 800 calories of actual food daily, surviving on Tic Tacs in spite, still gaining weight. That's when I completely lost it and went nuclear by hiring a personal trainer and running every morning while cutting everything I could think of. The trainer literally watched me eat lunch once. Because he didn't believe my food diary, kept saying, this doesn't make sense. He watched the scale go up week after week, despite me eating 1,200 calories max and working out two hours daily. After I gained another 10 pounds, he had me wear a fitness tracker 24 7 that showed I should be.

My twin sister Emma always got the compliments. Same face, same hair, same everything. But somehow I was the backup copy. Teachers would say things like, oh, you're Emma's sister when they met me. Boys would ask me to introduce them to Emma. Even our own grandma would mix up our names, then correct herself and say, oh, wait, you're the other one. The worst part was picture day in 7th grade. Mom made us wear matching blue dresses because she thought it would be adorable. We stood next to each other for the twin photo. And when the photographer looked through his camera, he actually moved me behind Emma. This way the lighting hits better, he said. I knew what he meant. Emma never noticed how differently people treated us. She'd bounce into rooms and everyone would light up. I'd follow behind and get polite smiles. When we turned 16, Dad took us car shopping. The salesman spent the whole time talking to Emma about features and colors. He asked me if I was getting a car, too. Like I was just there for the ride. That summer, everything changed when Emma left for cheerleading camp. For two weeks, I was just me. I started wearing my hair differently, bought clothes Emma would never pick, and actually talk to people. Instead of letting her do all the talking, when Marcus from my chemistry class Asked me to hang out. I couldn't believe he was talking to me and not waiting for Emma to show up. We went to the movies and got burgers after kept staring at me and I thought maybe something was wrong with my makeup. Finally, he said, you know, you're way more interesting than your sister. I nearly choked on my drink. Emma's pretty and all, but she only talks about cheerleading and drama. You actually have thoughts about things.

Last month at the dog park, this couple approached me while I was throwing a tennis ball for my dog, waffle. The woman immediately started sobbing when she saw him. Her husband had his arm around her shoulders and explained through his own tears that I had their dog, their baby, who'd escaped from their backyard and they've been searching everywhere since I'd found waffle wandering around the parking lot behind my apartment building six months ago, no collar, ribs showing through his matted fur and figured someone had dumped him. The husband pulled out his phone, showing me dozens of photos that definitely look like waffle, playing in their backyard, swimming in their pool, sleeping on their couch. He said his name was Cooper. And when he called that name, Waffle's ears perked up and he barked, which made my stomach drop because I've been so sure he was abandoned. The wife was crying into Waffle's fur while he licked her face. And her husband pulled out his wallet and started counting hundred dollar bills. We'll give you $5,000 for him, he said, his hands shaking as he held out the cash. I know you've been taking care of him and we want to reimburse you for everything, food and vet bills in your time because you saved our baby's life. We thought our lives were over when he got out. I stared at the money feeling sick because I didn't Want their money. And I definitely didn't want to give up waffle. This dog had been my only friend through the worst breakup of my life, sleeping next to me every night when I couldn't stop crying about my ex forcing me to go outside when I wanted to rot in bed forever. But watching this woman sob while showing me more photos of their family vacations with him made my chest hurt. These people were destroyed by losing their dog. And here I was keeping him from his real family when I just been the person who found him. If they were willing to pay $5,000 just to get him back, he must mean everything to them. I told them to keep their money and just take him. But I was glad he had people who loved him that much. The woman hugged me so tight I couldn't breathe while thanking me over and over. Waffle kept looking back at me as I handed his leash to the husband, probably confused about why I wasn't coming with them. The woman coaxed him toward their car with an excited voice, telling him they were going home. I told myself he'd be happier with his real family, with a yard and another dog to play with like in their photos. The husband shook my hand and said, you're a good person. Not many people would do this. And I stood there in the empty dog park trying not to cry. I Couldn't stop myself. Waffle was such a good dog and I had no idea when we woke up that that was my last day with him. The next three weeks were exactly as horrible as I expected. I kept looking for waffle every time I opened my door, kept saving bacon scraps before remembering he wasn't there to beg for them. I bought a goldfish just to have something alive in my apartment. But it wasn't the same as having someone genuinely excited to see me exist. Started taking different routes home to avoid the dog park and threw out his bed because looking at it made me wanna scream. But I told myself at least he was back where he belonged. I kept hoping I'd hear from his family, that maybe they'd send me a picture of him all settled in, but they never did. Then yesterday, I was scrolling through next door looking for a used coffee table when I saw a post that made me drop my phone. Someone had written warning, dog kidnappers active in our neighborhood. With a blurry security camera photo attached, post explained that criminals were stealing purebred dogs from yards and dog parks, then selling them to puppy Mills and collectors overseas for massive profits. They worked in pairs, usually a couple, and used fake sob stories about losing their beloved pet to guilt owners into giving up their dogs. My hands were shaking as I clicked on the photo to enlarge It, even with the terrible quality, I could see it was them, the same couple from the dog park leading someone else's German Shepherd into the same car waffle had.

My eight year old son, Zane was dancing in the living room, excited about going to his aunt's wedding. Being autistic, he didn't get to go places with other people, so this was big for him. He was just finishing showing me his moonwalk when my phone buzzed. It was the bride's mother. Hey, my daughter's wedding is tomorrow, and I'm not having your little freak son ruining it. Besides, she already deals with that creature enough when babysitting. Don't bring him. I'm deadly serious. At the text in disbelief. Before I could respond, Zane had climbed onto the couch next to me. Is that about the wedding? I tried to turn the phone away, but he'd already seen it. His face crumpled as he read the words freak and creature. She. She doesn't want me. His voice was tiny. I'm a creature. The tears started immediately. Not a tantrum, just silent tears rolling down his face. I thought Aunt Jessica loved me. She does love you, buddy. This is Reagan, not Jessica. Reagan texted again. I hired security. Your son's name isn't on the list. Zane saw that one, too. Security like police to keep me out? I texted back, Jessica loves him. She'd be heartbroken if he wasn't there. Her response was instant. It's my money paying for this wedding, my rules. Zane was full on sobbing now. I practiced my dancing for nothing. I wanted to Show everyone my moonwalk. I pulled him into my lap. Listen to me. We are going to that wedding. Reagan doesn't get to decide who loves you. But the security. Screw security. Aunt Jessica invited us. That's all that matters. I wiped his tears. You wanna go shopping for the coolest wedding outfit ever? His eyes lit up slightly. Really? We're going to make you look so awesome that Reagan's gonna be mad. She tried to keep you out. A small smile appeared. Can I get Dinosaur something? Dinosaur everything? If you want. He jumped up. We're really going. Promise? Promise. Now go get your shoes. We've got shopping to do. The next morning, Zane was bouncing with excitement as we enter the suit store. I want something Reagan will hate. The clerk laughed. Let's make you unforgettable. Blue tie because Aunt Jessica loves blue. Perfect choice, she said. Then whispered to me. Trouble with in laws. Mother of the bride doesn't want him there because of his autism. But the bride loves him and does. Her face hardened. Come with me, sweetheart. We're going to make you rock the show. She brought. How about Dinosaur tinted glasses? These are very trendy right now. Zane's jaw dropped. Dinosaur glasses? Can I, dad? Please? Reagan would absolutely lose her mind. Absolutely. My phone buzzed. Reagan, security will remove you both. The clerk saw my face. What else can we add? Oh, suspenders. Dinosaur suspenders! Zane screamed. Add them! I said. At the card store, Zane went straight for the biggest, most obnoxious card. This one has glitter that falls out. Perfect. Maximum mess. He carefully wrote, I love you and Jessica, and then absolutely covered it in Dinosaur stickers. Reagan's gonna hate these dinosaurs. My phone rang. Jessica. Mom said Zane sick. Not sick at all. Your mom doesn't want him there. What? No, he's coming. In fact, I have a special job for him. Official ring bearer. Don't tell mom. Meanwhile, Zane discovered temporary tattoos. Dad, dragon tattoos. Get three packs. She's gonna be so mad. He was actually giggling. Now, at home, Zane picked the brightest flowers from our garden. Every color like a Dinosaur. He wrapped them in neon pink paper towels with orange ribbon. This is the ugliest bouquet ever. She'll hate it, but Aunt Jessica will think it's funny. Cousin texted. Heard what Reagan did. We've got your back. Also, Grandma's coming. Reagan banned her last year. This is gonna be epic. I texted. Zane modeled his complete look. Suit. Dinosaur glasses, suspenders, dragon tattoos on both hands. Do I look annoying? Spectacularly annoying. Reagan sent a photo. Security knows your faces. Zane saw it. Dad, what if they really don't let us in? Then we make such a scene that Jessica comes out and gets us. Can I yell really loud? The loudest. He practiced his entrance. Aunt Jessica, it's me, Zane. The one Reagan hates. In the car, he was ready for war. Dinosaur glasses on, clutching his glitter bomb card. Dad, Reagan's gonna be so embarrassed. That's the plan, buddy. Pulling up, my cousin waved us through the door. Reagan's already drunk at the bar. You're clear. We walked in. Reagan spotted us immediately, her face contorting in rage. She started power walking over, wobbling in her heels. Aunt Jessica Zane screamed across the entire venue. Jessica turned, squealed.

Well, I said yes, but honestly, I should have known better. I'm the mom who still uses the same drugstore mascara from 2,019 and considers Chapstick a full makeup look. My idea of getting fancy is adding lip gloss. So there we are in my bathroom, and I'm trying to show Maya how to do eyeliner, but every time I touch the pencil to her eyelid, it looks like I'm drawing with a broken crayon held by someone having a seizure. She's being super patient, but after my third attempt at winged eyeliner that looks more like a bird with one broken wing, she stops me. Mom, this looks like you're trying to draw a map of Florida on my face! She says, trying not to laugh. Maybe we need to practice on someone else first. I'm thinking, great! Now she wants me to call her aunt over or something, but then she grins and points toward the living room where my husband Mike is watching football. Dad! She yells, before I can stop her. Come here! We need you! Mike walks in, completely clueless, still holding his beer and wearing his ratty Eagles Jersey, and Maya explains our situation. I'm expecting him to bolt faster than he does when I mention the words honey do list, but instead he plops down on the toilet seat and goes alright, ladies make me beautiful, but I'm keeping the beer. I'm standing there with my mouth open like a fish, but Maya's already pulling out her phone to look up tutorials. Okay, dad, first we need to figure out your skin tone. Are you warm or cool? Mike squints at himself in the mirror. I'm confused. For the next three hours, we turn my husband into what I can only describe as a masterpiece. Maya's doing one side of his face while I fumble through the other, and Mike's providing running commentary like he's a sports announcer. And there's mom with the foundation brush. She's going for full coverage, but it's looking a little streaky in the T zone. She's teaching both of us at this point, pulling up YouTube tutorials on her phone and pausing every five seconds. I'm learning terms I never knew existed. And Mike's genuinely fascinated by the whole process. Mike's asking questions like, what's the difference between bronzer and contour? And should my eyebrows match my hair? He's genuinely invested in this process, taking notes on his phone about color matching. By the time we're done, this man looks like he could walk a runway. Full coverage foundation, perfectly blended eyeshadow and smoky grays and blues, winged eyeliner that actually matches on both sides, and lips that are somehow more perfect than mine have ever been. The best part? He refuses to wash it off. He struts into the kitchen and starts making dinner, still wearing everything. When Maya asks if He wants to take it off before we eat. He goes, are you kidding? I look incredible. This contouring really brings out my cheekbones. We're sitting at dinner, and my husband is serving us spaghetti while wearing a full face of glam makeup, explaining to Maya why she should invest in a good

It started about 6 months ago. Every argument, every little thing that didn't go her way, slam. Every time I asked her to do dishes, slam. When I told her she couldn't go to some party where I knew they'd be drinking, slam. The sound would shake the whole upstairs. A coffee mug fell off my nightstand twice from the vibrations. My husband Dave kept telling me to ignore it. He'd say kids go through phases. She'll grow out of it. Easy for him to say since he's usually at work when most of the slamming happens. I'm the one working from home trying to take client calls while slam echoes through the house. Breaking point came on a Tuesday. Emma wanted to borrow my car to drive to her friend Jesse's house. I said no because she got a speeding ticket the week before and we agreed her driving privileges were suspended. She started screaming about how unfair I was, how I never trust her, how all her friends think I'm psycho. Then she stomped upstairs and slam. But this time was different. This time I heard something crack. I went up to check and there was a split running down the door frame. The wood was actually damaged. That door had been slammed so hard and so many times that it was breaking the house. I stood there staring at that crack and something just snapped. In me. I marched to the garage, grabbed Dave's screwdriver set and went back upstairs. Emma was inside her room blasting music, probably expecting me to yell at her through the door like usual. Instead, I started unscrewing the hinges. It took me about 10 minutes. Emma didn't even notice until I was lifting the door off the frame. Then her music stopped. Real quick, mom, what are you doing? She called out. Solving a problem, I said. Carrying her door downstairs to the garage, she appeared at the top of the stairs in her pajamas, mouth hanging open. You can't take my door. I need privacy. You lost door privileges when you damaged the house. I told her privacy is earned, not guaranteed. The next few days were interesting. Emma tried everything. She hung a bed sheet across the doorway, which I took down. She moved her dresser to block the opening so I moved it back. While she was at school, she even tried staying at her friend's house, but Jess's mom called me asking what was going on. By day 4, Emma was sitting on her bed when I got home from the grocery store. No music, no phone, just sitting there. This is embarrassing, she said. What if someone comes over? Then maybe you'll think twice before destroying property. I said, I wasn't destroying anything. I was just mad. The door frame says otherwise. That's when she actually looked at the crack she'd made. I could See her face change when she realised she'd actually damaged something. Day 7 was when things got real. Emma's boyfriend, Tyler, came over to work on some school project. I watched.

He'd been talking about this girl non stop for weeks, drawing her pictures of stick figures, holding hands and asking if I could teach him how to make a wedding cake. Even started saving his allowance quarters in a jar labeled for Maddie's ring and his messy crayon handwriting. This morning was different. He woke up in his Sunday clothes, hair slicked back, back with water, carrying a plastic ring from a cereal box, kind with the fake diamond that turns your finger green after five minutes of wearing it. Today is the day, mom. I tried explaining that's not how it works. Marriage is for grown UPS. But he was already by the door with his backpack, straightening his little tie that was crooked as always. He'd even brushed his teeth without being asked, which should have been my first warning sign. Fine, let's go to school. The walk felt longer than usual because he kept practicing his proposal speech under his breath, caught bits and pieces about promising to share his goldfish crackers forever and never pulling her pigtails even when she was being annoying during story time. We walked into his classroom and I watched him march straight to Maddie's table. With the confidence of a man on a mission, she was coloring quietly with her friend Sarah, completely unaware of what was about to happen to her Tuesday morning cleared his throat loudly like he'd seen in movies. The whole table looked out on their artwork. He got down on one knee right there on the alphabet carpet, wobbling slightly but maintaining his addition. Maddie, will you marry me? The entire classroom went silent. Even Missus Madison stopped mid sentence while reading to the other kids. In the corner, 20 pairs of tiny eyes stared at the scene unfolding like they were watching the most dramatic soap opera episode ever. Maddie looked at the ring, looked at him and said, very seriously, do you have a job? My heart melted. This four year old was conducting a proper job interview before accepting a marriage proposal. I help my mom with dishes every night and I feed my fish every day without forgetting. Do you have a car? My mom drives me everywhere, but I know where she keeps the key, please. Do you have your own house? Paused, thinking hard, could see the wheels turning in his little brain as he tried to figure out the best answer. but I have bunk beds and my own nightlight that looks like a Dinosaur.

I mean, Brandon literally has no personality of his own. He mirrors whatever you want. That's not love. That's having a human golden retriever. Her face got all red, and she started getting defensive, talking about how I don't know their relationship and how Brandon is sweet and caring. I told her, that's exactly my point. He's safe and easy, and she never has to deal with any real conflict or growth or challenge. You want someone who will never disagree with you, never push you, never make you question anything about yourself. That's not a partnership. That's just having a really expensive pet that can drive you places. She threw her nail polish bottle at me, and it hit the hotel wall, leaving this pink splatter that looked like someone got murdered. She started crying and yelling about how I'm just jealous because I can't keep a relationship longer than six months, which. Okay, fair point, but also completely missing what I was trying to say. The next morning, she wasn't talking to me, and the whole car ride home was silent, except for her playing the same Taylor Swift song on repeat, like she was trying to make some kind of point. When we got back to town, she went straight to Brandon's place, and I didn't hear from her for two weeks. Then out of nowhere, she calls me, crying. Turns out she had tried to start a fight. With

I've been taking my breaks in the dollar store break room for 8 months every single day at two thirty PM like clockwork. Me, my sad Turkey sandwich and 15 minutes of peace before diving back into retail hell. My co worker desire would joke that she could set her watch by my break schedule. Even our manager Adam knew not to look for me at 2:30. But then corporate announced a district manager visit. Adam went into full panic mode, making us deep clean shelves that hadn't been touched since Obama was president. He pulled me aside that Monday morning. Look, I need everyone looking extra busy this week. Maybe mix up your break times. We can't have suits thinking we're predictable. It seemed simple enough. Just take breaks at random times instead of 2:30. What could possibly go wrong? That first day I took my break at 3:45 instead, grabbed my sandwich and headed outside to the loading dock area by the dumpsters. It was actually nicer than the break room. The fresh air, no flickering fluorescent lights, no smell of microwaved fish from whatever desire I brought. I was maybe three bites into my sandwich when our cashier Terrell walked by to throw out some cardboard. He waved at me, took two and suddenly grabbed his stomach. His face went green. He barely made it to the dumpster before throwing up violently. I jumped up to Help. But he waved me off and stumbled back inside. Twenty minutes later, Desiree came out to ask if I'd seen Terrell. I told her what happened. She was standing maybe five feet from where I was sitting. Mid sentence, her eyes went wide. She clutched her stomach and ran back inside. I could hear her wretching in the employee bathroom from outside and Adam came looking for both of them. Same thing happened. They got within a few feet of my break spot, turned pale and had to rush inside. By the end of my shift, three employees had gotten violently sick, all after coming near me during my break. Adam thought it was food poisoning from the deli next door. We'd all eaten there recently. But the next day, I took my break at 1:00, 15, same spot outside. Our delivery driver, who'd never eaten at that deli, walked past me and immediately got sick. Then two customers who were smoking nearby started gagging and had to leave. Desiree suggested maybe a gas leak from the loading dock. The maintenance checked everything and found nothing. Convinced it was anxiety about the district manager. Mass hysteria, he called it, except the people getting sick weren't even employees. Adam blamed carbon monoxide from delivery trucks. We bought a detector. It showed, but nothing. By day three, I was freaking out. I decided to test it. Took my break at 11:00am, way earlier than usual. Sat in my usual spot eating My sandwich. Like clockwork, anyone who came within 10 feet of me started feeling nauseous. But here's the weird part. It only happened during my break. I could work next to these same people all day on the floor, nothing. The second I was on break eating my lunch outside, they get sick. Everything. Different food, no food, different clothes, different deodorant. Didn't matter. Thursday, Desiree had a theory. Maybe it's something about that specific spot, like maybe something died under the concrete or there's toxic waste. Seemed logical. So Friday, I took my break in the front of the store on the bench where customers usually sat. Within minutes, a woman walking her dog started dry heaving. Her dog was fine, but she had to sit down looking green. An old man buying batteries had to abandon his cart and rush to his car. Even Adam watching from inside started looking queezy through the window. But when I went back to work helped.

I'm half Korean but look completely white. Nobody ever expects me to speak Korean, which has given me some interesting advantages over the years. Last month, I was at this trendy ramen place downtown with my friend Stella. We got seated near the window and two minutes later, three Korean guys sat down right behind us. College students with designer clothes and expensive watches. Total trust fund kid vibes. Stella launched into her dating drama about her ex texting her at 3:00am. I was nodding along when I heard one guy behind us say in Korean, check out that blonde girl in front of us. She, it's actually really pretty. I kept eating my ramen acting clueless. My mom made sure I was fluent growing up, but I've Learned it's better to let people think I don't understand. You learn a lot when they think you can't hear them. His friend responded, yeah, she's hot but probably has zero personality. Look how she's dressed. Probably spends her whole paycheck on clothes. I was wearing a tar get dressed and drugstore mascara. But okay. The third guy laughed. White girls like that are all the same. No substance, just Instagram and shopping. But she's never read a book. I have a master's degree in literature. But sure, Stella was still talking about her ex, completely oblivious to the commentary happening behind us. These guys were getting more obnoxious by The minute look at her trying to use chopsticks, the first guy said, giggling. She's holding them like a kindergartner. This is painful to watch. His friends burst out laughing. Should we go help? We could play the hello Korean guys teaching the clueless white girl how to eat properly. She'd probably be so grateful for our cultural expertise. Another added, they started planning this elaborate scheme to come over and rescue me from my terrible chopstick technique, then use it to hit on me. The condescension was unreal. Stella finished her story and asked what I thought. I told her to block her ex while these guys kept patting behind us. I bet she doesn't even know what miso is, one said. White girls love that exotic Asian guy thing. This will be easy. We could totally impress her with our food knowledge. Another added, I was getting more annoyed by the second, but decided to wait and see how far they take this ridiculous land. They kept going on about how grateful I'd be for their help. She'll probably ask for our numbers after one last. We'll be like her Asian food heroes. So whole thing was so cringe, I almost wanted to turn around and end it right there. But I knew waiting would make the payoff even better. About 10 minutes later, they finished their ramen and got up. I could feel them approaching behind me, probably pumping themselves up for their big rescue mission. The First guy tapped my shoulder and said in English with this exaggerated hell tone, excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, but I noticed you might be having trouble with your chopsticks. Would you like me to show you an easier way? His friends stood behind him, trying not to smirk. They probably thought they were so smooth. I looked up with my best confused expression.

Emma came home from school last Tuesday looking all pouty, dropping her backpack with that dramatic thud only 13 year olds can master. What's wrong? I asked, stirring Mac and cheese on the stove like I did every Tuesday. Madison's mom is so cool, she muttered, slumping into a kitchen chair. She lets Madison wear whatever she wants, doesn't make her do chores, and they go shopping together like they're best friends. She even bought Madison a crop top yesterday. Emma crossed her arms. I wish you were more like her instead of being so strict about everything. That hit me weird. I've been raising Emma alone since her dad left when she was seven, working my butt off as a bank teller to keep us afloat. I thought I was doing okay, making sure she ate vegetables at a bedtime, did her homework. But maybe I was being too uptight. You know what? I said, turning off the stove. You're right. Let's go shopping right now. Emma's face lit up like Christmas morning. Really? Can we go to the mall where Madison shops? Two hours later, we were walking through target with a cart full of stuff I never would have bought before. Crop tops, makeup, a phone case with fake diamonds, energy drinks, even some of those expensive face masks she'd been begging for. When Emma asked if she Could get her ears pierced at the kiosk. I said yes before my brain could catch up. That weekend, I let her have friends over without hovering. I ordered pizza instead of making them eat carrot sticks. When they wanted to watch some rated R movie on Netflix, I figured, why not? When Emma asked if she could walk to the convenience store with Madison at 9 p m, I handed her 20 bucks. The next week, Emma started staying out later. Madison's mom lets her stay out until 11 on school nights. She'd text me at 10:30. I text back, okay, even though my stomach felt twisted up.

I was getting my toes done for my husband and I's high school reunion. Nothing fancy, just a simple ballet, pink coat and some exfoliation, if you know. You know, the nail tech was massaging my postpartum Shrek feet when my phone buzzed. It was my husband. Hey, since you still look pregnant and chubby, I think you should skip the reunion. I don't want people thinking I married someone who let herself go. I was trying so hard not to look pregnant and chubby. I think you should skip the reunion. I don't want people thinking I married someone who let herself go. I was trying so hard not to cry, but it didn't work. We had been together since high school. That's when the girl getting her acrylics done handed me a Kleenex. Hey, my love, are you okay? I could even speak. Just turned my phone toward her to show her our conversation. she yanked my phone out of my hands and started Facetiming him. Hey, is this Anthony? Yeah, I'm here with your beautiful wife and. Oh, hey, who's this? He cut her off. You look cute. If my wife looked anything like you, we wouldn't have any problems. That man had the audacity to laugh after he said it like it was the funniest thing in the world. The entire salon went dead silent. She hung up immediately. Her face Pure disgust. Girl. The nail tech announced loudly, we have a code red situation. Every woman in that damn salon turned around to face me. The lady with foils in her hair, the woman mid lip wax. Everyone. Mia. The salon owner told me to text him back that I was staying home. Nothing else. I typed with shaking fingers, you're right. Staying home tonight. His response was instant. Good girl. That's when the salon exploded. The woman getting highlights owned one of the biggest homemade dress stores on Etsy. She insisted I take the red dress from her site. The four hundred dollar one. The eyebrow lady's daughter, who did makeup for the new station, was clearing her schedule. A college girl's mom could watch the baby. The girl who Facetimed him called in sick to work to be my plus 1. Two other women getting pedicures were coming as backup. Mia locked the door and flipped the sign to closed. Ladies, we have five hours to make this man regret his entire existence. The transformation started immediately. Hair extensions for my postpartum hair loss. Spray tan for that glow. Professional makeup that made my cheekbones look Bonita. They taught me how to walk in heels again. Made. He practiced my entrance over and over. Girl, put your shoulders back. You literally pushed a whole human out of your body three months ago. You can do anything. The boutique owner returned with the dress and shapewear. Not because I Needed it, but because it would make me feel incredible. The reunion was at the Hilton downtown. He'd been there an hour already, according to his Instagram story. We walked in at 8:30, and there he was with some blonde girl, his hand on her lower back, introducing her to our old classmates. I froze. The girl who Facetimed him grabbed my hand, and we followed them to the back. From hallway. The blonde went into the lady's room. We went in after her. Hey, sorry. Weird question. Are you here with Anthony? Yeah, we matched on hinge three days ago. He's cute, isn't he? She giggled. The silence was deafening. I'm his wife. Her face went white, then red. Um, are you fucking serious right now? Her acrylic nails aggressively tapped against her screen as she went into their conversation. He told her he was single, that he hadn't felt like this in years, and he's been waiting for someone like her for his entire life. Every woman in that bathroom was seeing red. Even random girls from other classes who were just trying to pee. Girl, this man is a fucking idiot. You're beautiful, the blonde shouted, taking my hand and twirling me around like hello. If I was him, I would be lining the red carpet for you every single morning. She stormed out and walked straight up to him in front of everyone. The DJ had just turned the music down for announcements. Perfect timing. You're On hinge while you have a wife? She threw her cocktail in his face. A wife who just had your baby? The entire gymnasium went silent. You told me you were single, that you were practically falling in love with me. I stepped forward. We have a baby girl at home, Anthony. His old English teacher, Miss Bradley, was standing right there asking if this was true. His ex girlfriend, Bethany, called out that she dodged a bullet. Like girl, period. Definitely fucking did. The principal's wife remembered him and said it was disgraceful. Every woman in that room was staring at him. He was stammering, soaking wet, looking around for any support. He ran, literally ran out of there. I danced until midnight with my new salon sisters. The hinge girl stuck around and we actually became friends. But then my phone started buzzing and I was low key hoping it was my old hallway crush who was standing across the room looking delicious as ever. Unfortunately, it was just my lousy ex husband. I told you to stay home for a reason, you Mono Fucking bitch! First you refuse to lose weight, then you humiliate me. The messages just kept coming. Each one more unhinged than the last. But I didn't type a single word back. Instead, I just screenshotted everything. Opened our family group chat where his mom, sisters, and aunts were all waiting for reunion photos. I forwarded every single one.

So my sister Emma has been dating this guy, Ryan, for about 8 months. Lately. I started noticing some weird patterns when I was from college. During breaks, every time Ryan would get all romantic or touchy with Emma, she'd suddenly remember she was on her period. At first I didn't think much of it, but then I started keeping track because I'm nosy like that. She was claiming to have her period like three weeks out of every month. That's not how biology works. I share a bathroom with Emma and there's literally no evidence of any period stuff happening. No tampons in the trash, no pads, nothing. Plus, she's been asking me to buy her chocolate during what she calls her period week. But then I catch her giving it all to her friend Katie at school. The whole thing came to a head last Tuesday when Ryan came over with this elaborate dinner he'd cooked himself, candles, fancy pasta, the works. He was clearly trying to set a romantic mood. Emma took one look at the setup and immediately clutched her stomach saying her cramps were killing her. Ryan was so sweet about it, he ran to the store to get her heating pads and those expensive chocolates she likes. Meanwhile, Emma was in our room facetiming Katie and laughing about how she dodged another bullet. That's when I realized she was completely playing This poor guy. When Ryan got back, Emma had already changed into baggy sweatpants and was rolled up on the couch with a blanket. She gave him this pitiful look and said her period just started unexpectedly. Ryan offered to cancel their weekend trip they've been planning for months. Emma just shrugged and said maybe it was for the best. I felt so bad watching Ryan's face fall. This guy had been talking about their trip for weeks, showing me pictures of this cute cabin he booked. He even Learned how to make her favorite breakfast just for the weekend. And Emma was throwing it all away because she couldn't handle basic intimacy. After Emma went to shower, Ryan sat on our couch looking defeated. He started talking about how he was worried Emma wasn't attracted to him anymore. He wondered if he was doing something wrong or if she was losing interest. The guy was irring, questioning their entire relationship. That's when I snapped. I couldn't watch him blame himself for Emma's lies anymore. I told him straight up that Emma hasn't had a real period in months. She's been faking it to avoid getting close to him. Ryan's face went through about five different emotions in 10 seconds. At first, he didn't believe me, so I showed him our shared bathroom cabinet, empty. No period supplies anywhere. Then I told him about the chocolate thing and how she was laughing about dodging bullets with Katie. You could literally See the pieces clicking together in his brain. Ryan got quiet for a really long time. Then he asked if I thought Emma even wanted to be with. I told him honestly that I didn't know. But lying about something like this wasn't fair to either of them. They needed to have a real conversation about what Emma actually wanted. When Emma got out of the shower, Ryan was gone. She found a note saying he needed some space to think about things. Emma freaked out and started calling him non stop when he wouldn't answer.

My parents promised when I was 12 that if I didn't get in trouble at school for an entire year, they'd buy me the gaming setup I've been begging for a $2,000 PC with RGB lighting, mechanical keyboard, the works. This was monumental because I was basically the class troublemaker. Detention was my second home. I'd put whoopee cushions on teachers chairs, start food fights and once released three hamsters during a math test. My my parents were constantly getting calls from the principal but I wanted that gaming setup more than I'd ever wanted anything. Streaming was my dream and all the big streamers had setups like that. So I made the deal and completely transformed overnight. When kids tried recruiting me for pranks, I'd shake my head and walk away. When substitute teachers made themselves easy targets, I'd bite my tongue so hard it bled. My reputation as the funny kid started dying but I didn't care. Dude, what happened to you? My best friend Jamir asked after I refused to help him put plastic wrap on toilet seats. Just focusing on important stuff, I'd say picturing myself streaming to thousands of viewers. September passed October, November, zero detentions, zero office visits. I even started volunteering to help teachers carry supplies and clean whiteboards. Kids called me a brown noser, but my parents seem genuinely impressed. Really proud of you, my mom said during parent teacher conferences, Mrs. Freeman says you're like A different kid. Keep it up, kiddo. My dad added that gaming setups looking more real every day. I started researching streaming software and planning my channel. I'd watch YouTube tutorials about building audiences and memorize the specs of professional microphones. Christmas break came and went. January, February, March, I was a model student when Joey Patterson got caught cheating and tried dragging me down with him. I stayed silent when the fire alarm mysteriously went off during the state test. I didn't even smirk. April arrived. I was so close I could practically hear the mechanical keyboard clicking. Eight months of perfect behavior, just two months left. Then came the incident that destroyed everything it was. It was a Tuesday in Missus Guzman's English class. She was droning on about symbolism in some boring novel when Casey Wells, who sat three rows behind me, crumpled up his worksheet and launched it like a paper for airplane. The paper hit Missus Guzman square in the back of her head. She spun around, face red with fury, scanning the classroom like a hawk. Her eyes swept past Casson, past Ashley, past Zane and landed directly on me office. Now, my stomach dropped, but Missus Guzman, I didn't. I saw you throw.

Elliot leaned in so close our breaths mingled and asked, how do I get close to your best friend? Elliot was the kind of gorgeous that made girls walk into lockers, but he sat there looking genuinely lost. I've never been on a date, he admitted. I almost laughed because he had at least three Valentine's offers this year alone. You literally have girls throwing themselves at you, I said. He shrugged. Sure, but it's different when I'm the one doing the chasing. I just freeze. I want this proposal to go well. That's when I realized he wasn't playing dumb. He actually didn't understand. He was attractive enough to where planning a proposal wasn't even necessary. But then again, the girl he wanted to take was none other than the most beautiful, talented, intelligent girl in the school. My best friend Brian, with green eyes and light brown hair and an acceptance letter to Yale. There was nothing missing from her. Elliot slid over a small envelope. Here's my bride. I almost started hyperventilating. Comic Con weekend tickets and a free hotel. Holy Mother of all! I shook his hand enthusiastically. Three weeks. I'll teach you everything in three weeks. First week we studied the basics. After school, I taught him to how give compliments without sounding like he was reading from a script. Notice the small things, I said. New earrings if she looks tired. If she changed her hair, he was clumsy at first. Great haircut. You look pretty beautiful. I burst into laughter while he glared back. Compliments aren't about the adjectives you use. It's the heart, the sound, the honesty. He nodded, then looked me in the eyes. I like the way your eyes get brighter when you talk about something you love. My face flushed as he grunted, that's good. I managed to save that for Vianne. The practice continued, and by the end of the week he was a complimenting machine, and I was immune to his one liners. Well, almost immune. By week two we moved on to actual romancing. We met up for a picnic at a popular dating spot, became competitive at bowling, and hung out at his place to watch movies. In the evening we practice slow dancing in the garage, stepping on each other's toes for fun. Dates are pretty great. I don't know why I kept freezing up before, he said, spinning me around. That's because most people our age do way more on dates. I made kissy sounds in his ear, and he jumped back, staring daggers at me for teasing him. I grinned as he helped me back up. Let's practice slow dancing, too, he suggested, slipping his arms to my waist, carefully making the heart of my chest pound wildly. Is this okay? He breathed against my hair. I could barely breathe, let alone answer. The night before the proposal, I Helped him pick out his outfit and style his hair exactly the way beyond preferred. Do I look good? For a second I forgot how to speak. You're like a prince, I breathed, and quickly added, that's what Leanne would say. We did one final practice run in the park. He strung up fairy lights and held onto my hand, gently stroking the back of it with his thumb. I stared up at him, at the large brown eyes sprinkled with golden specks from the fairy lights, and smiled. He leaned in slowly, but just as I closed my eyes, he paused, dropping my hands, and took a step back. Leanne's going to love this. Reality crashed back hard. My heart squeezed painfully while I forced myself to agree. I think you'll do perfectly, I reminded him. Comic con was the same weekend as prom. I know, he said. Thanks for bullying me. I mean, teaching me. He winked and pulled me into one last tight hug. Enjoy Comic Con. I squeezed back. Enjoy prom. That Friday, the whole school watched as Elliot approached Vian at lunch with flowers and a giant proposal sign. He executed everything perfectly, just like we'd practiced. Speech, the timing, even the way he held the flowers. Vian squealed and said yes! While everyone filmed it. The cafeteria erupted in cheers while my heart broke into a million pieces. How could I have let myself fall for a guy who was clear from the start? He wanted Vian, not me. Elliot's eyes found mine in the crowd for just a second before Vian pulled him into a hug. I quickly wiped away tears and walked off. I left school early, claiming I felt sick, which was

For over a year, cops were at my house. My bank accounts got frozen and people I thought were friends basically ghosted me. Meanwhile, Tyler's walking around like he's some misunderstood victim. And he even brought his new girlfriend to court. Yeah, the same girl he was cheating on me with while I was home with our twin boys. The courtroom was packed. Tyler had his whole family there supporting him. I just had my sister Kim and my lawyer. The process, Peter had just finished showing all the evidence that proved Tyler not only forged my name on loan papers, but also used our kids Social Security numbers to open fake credit cards. Like, who is that to their own children? When the judge asked Tyler if he wanted to say anything, of course, he stood up and gave this whole sob story about being a devoted father and husband who was just trying to provide for his family. He actually had the nerve to say that I had manipulated the situation and that everyone in the courtroom knew. I wasn't the innocent person I was pretending to be. When he sat down, he had this smug little smile on his face like he just won an Oscar. Then the judge looked right at me and asked if I wanted to say anything before the final decision. I hadn't planned on speaking at all, but something inside me just snapped. Maybe it was seeing his girlfriend sitting there in the front row.

Clearly, a lot of people don't know what generations are. So let me explain it. Generations are simply based on the year you were born. Gen Z is 1997 to 2,012. It doesn't matter if you think you had a Gen Z childhood or you relate more to people in Gen Z. And I think a lot of kids are embarrassed to be a part of Gen Alpha, but it is completely normal for older generations to make fun of younger generations. And a lot of the kids saying that they had a Gen Z childhood didn't really have one at all. For example, I saw a kid saying 2015 should be considered Gen Z because they liked fidgets when they were younger and lived through Covid. I don't know about you guys, but most of Gen Z grew up on squishies and slime. And considering that they would have only been 5 to 6 years old during Covid, like how would they even really experience how Covid was like considering the era of it on TikTok and stuff? And just because you don't make skippity toilet jokes doesn't make you Gen Z anyways. I hope these kids learn to just accept it. By the way, this.

Now he regrets everything. When Jake knocked me up at 17, he laughed, actually laughed, said my parents will kill me if this ruins my baseball scholarship. Within a week, his entire family moved three states away, ghosted me, blocked me, vanished like a coward in a Letterman jacket. But I wasn't going to be a statistic. My parents were furious but weirdly supportive. They helped me finish high school online and I gave birth to my son Tommy over Christmas break with jingle bells playing in the background. Cute, right? Tommy and I basically grew up together. I worked three jobs while getting my nursing degree. Mom watched him when she could. We ate so much ramen that he thought it was a food group. We lived in a tiny shoebox apartment with a couch I bought off Craigslist for $15 and dreams duct taped together. But it worked. By the time Tommy was 10, I was a pediatric I c u nurse and he was this funny, smart, ridiculous little human who made life fun even on two hours of sleep. Then I met Daniel. Daniel's a pediatric surgeon, smart, kind, didn't blink when I told him I had a 10 year old. On our third date, Tommy had a cold and Daniel brought over soup and comic books. I think I fell in love right then. Two years later, we got married and Daniel adopted Tommy. Tommy calls him dad like he Was born to because honestly, he kind of was. We had twin girls three years ago and Tommy is the sweetest big brother. Straight a student, star pitcher for his high school and I mean star college scouts come to see him. Then last month, his team made it to the state championships. I was screaming my lungs out from the bleachers, phone in hand, filming every pitch like a full blown stage, mom. That's when I saw Jake. Same face, just older. He was staring at Tommy like he was.

My husband and I adopted our daughter, Zoe, when she was six years old. She'd been in the foster system for three years after being removed from a severely neglectful home. Zoe had been placed with three different families before us, but each time, the adoptive parents sent her back to foster care when her behavioural issues became too difficult to handle. Zoe's first day with us seemed to go well. She was quiet but polite, said thank you for everything, and didn't cause any trouble. That night, we showed her to her new bedroom. We'd spent weeks decorating it. Pink walls, stuffed animals, and a comfortable bed with soft blankets. This is your room, Zoe. Everything here is yours. She nodded and whispered thank you. We tucked her in, read her a bedtime story, and said good night. But around 2:00am, I woke up and decided to check on her. Her bedroom was empty. I found her in the kitchen, pulled up on the floor behind the refrigerator, wide awake. Zoe, sweetie, what are you doing down here? She looked terrified. I'm sorry. I'll go back upstairs. Why are you sleeping on the floor? This is where I'm supposed to sleep. My heart broke. Honey, you have a beautiful bed upstairs. That's your bed. But I was bad today. Bad? You weren't bad at all. I spilled water at dinner, and I forgot to say Thank you. When you gave me the towel. Zoe, those aren't bad things. They're just normal things that happen. In my old house, when I was bad, I had to sleep on the kitchen floor. I started crying. This little girl thought she was being punished and had put herself in time out on our kitchen floor. This went on for two weeks. Every night she would sneak downstairs to sleep on the kitchen floor. The breakthrough came when our social worker suggested we ask Zoe what would make her feel safe in her bed. I don't know, Zoe said quietly. I've never had a bed that was really mine. What do you mean? In my old house, I slept on the couch, but if mommy's boyfriend was mad, I had to sleep on. On the floor. In foster homes, they said the bed was mine, but then I'd have to leave. That's when I understood. She was afraid of getting attached to something that might be taken away. Zoe, would it help if we wrote your name on something so you know it's really yours? Her eyes lit up, like with a marker. I handed her a permanent marker. Write your name anywhere you want. Zoe carefully wrote. Zoe on the headboard of her bed, then on her dresser, then on the wall next to her bed. That night, for the first time, Zoe slept in her bed all night. But we weren't done with challenges. A few days. Later, I made spaghetti and meatballs. She ate everything, asked for seconds, then thirds. Zoe, you don't have to eat everything right now. There will be more food tomorrow. She looked panicked. But what if there isn't? Zoe was hoarding food because she'd Learned that meals weren't guaranteed. But the biggest shock came in late October. When I mentioned Halloween was coming up. She looked terrified. Halloween? Yes, sweetie, we're going to get you a costume and go trick or treating. She started crying. No, I have to hide.

Yesterday, my phone rang at 2:00am. It was the police. Ma'am, we have your six year old son, Tommy at the station. He walked here by himself, saying his mommy heard his baby sister. I shot out of bed. What? Tommy's in his room sleeping. And I don't have a baby sister. Ma'am, please come down to the station immediately. I ran to Tommy's room. Empty bed, front door wide open. At the police station, Tommy was wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The moment he saw me, he screamed, don't let her take me. She killed my sister. My heart stopped. The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away, too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room while Tommy sobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My Stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. I spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. His little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. This psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy's story never changed. Hours passed. The detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She showed me the room. She made all Pink and pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us? But before I could answer,

Hi. I was, um, calling to speak to Kate, please. Max, who's calling? Uh, this is Natalia. This is Kate. Hi. So, listen, I wanted to call you because I didn't want to start any drama or anything, but I wanted you to know that your husband David, asked me to join him for dinner. And I asked him, you know, hello, aren't you married? And he said, I'm in a marriage, but we're not exclusive to each other anymore. And I have to be honest, that whole thing just sounded kind of weird and fishy to me. So I just wanted to call you, just so you know what's going on, because I. Okay, hold on. Um, so my husband told you we weren't married anymore? No, no, no. He said that you were married, but it was an open marriage, I guess. Oh, well, that's really interesting. Hmm. Okay, so it's not an open marriage? No, it's not. It's nowhere close to being open. Oh, shit. Well, that's. Well, I'm seven months pregnant. I wouldn't open my marriage right now. Oh, wow. Okay, well, that's what I thought. Listen, I just wanted to make sure you knew what was going on, cause it was just all fishy. Yeah, it is fishy. What did you say your name was again? Hmm? Um, actually, Kate. This is actually the Z Morning Zoo radio show on Z1O4. We're right in the middle of something called dirty Work Wednesday. Right. Now. So this is a prank? No, no, no, no. It's not a prank. Um, we got a call from a girl who had a lot more than dinner with your husband, but all under the impression that he was in open marriage, which he lied about. Oh, when did this happen? This is ridiculous. Um, this happened at his company retreat in Williamsburg. Oh. Oh, great. So that's why he said spouses can't fucking come. Listen, I'm gonna kill him. We just got off the phone with him a minute ago. We can call him back right now if you want to confront him with all this. But you said this is on the radio. Yeah. Oh, I don't think you want to hear what I'm about to say on the radio. What? I mean, listen, we can bleep it all out. We. We have a thing called the bleep button. Um, hang on one second. Let. Let me call him back real quick.

How long until you get here? We're looking at about eight minutes. Uh, say peppers if there's somewhere safe you can get to. No. Definitely no peppers. It's a pizza, not a damn salad.

Hi, can I speak to Juliana, please? Yeah, this is she. Hey, Juliana, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Who is this? Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. I'm sorry, what? What is this? It's a radio show. Is this a scam? Are you trying to sell me something? I'm gonna hang up. No, I'm not trying to sell you anything at all. One of our listeners actually emailed us about you. Okay. His name is Sean, and he's a guy that you sort of went on a date with recently. Oh, that went down, right? Whoa. So you remember hanging out with Sean? Yeah, I remember him. It doesn't sound like you fondly remember him. You could say that. Oh. Oh, okay. Okay. He has great memories of you. Really? Yeah. That's why he emailed us. Sean wants to know why you're not calling him back. I think he's a sketchball. Is that a good enough reason? Really? What? No. I mean, we talked to him. I thought he was like dorky at worst, but a nice guy. So he called you? What did he say? Well, I don't wanna tell you cause you sound mad. It wasn't anything bad. I wanna know. I wanna know. What did he say? Well, he said that he met you at some show and you guys were bonding over the great banjo player that they had, and then you went to. Yeah, Then you went to a bar after. Whoa. And he spilled a drink on himself and asked if he could go back to your place to kind of clean his shirt up or something, which we all said had to be an excuse to just get over to your place, but he swore up and down it wasn't. So I guess he didn't mention to you that he's a thief. What? Whoa. A thief? No. Yeah, he's a kleptomaniac. He didn't drop that. What did he drop? Yeah, he didn't tell us that he likes to steal things. Yeah. So, uh, the next morning, I was in my room. He was on the couch. I heard some rustling in the hallway, and it was like, I don't know, like 5:00am or something. And then I heard a door close. So I called out. I was like, Sean? Sean? Hello? No answer. So I got up, walked out of the hallway, I looked around, I checked the couch. He wasn't there. He was gone. But I saw that the closet door in my hallway was open, where I keep my coats and stuff. Okay. And he had put his coat there. Uh huh. So I went over to close it, and his coat was gone. That makes sense, I guess, if he was gone. But then all of my hangers were gone, too. What, all of your. all of my empty hangers that were just hanging in my closet were Gone. What? They were there. They were there before he came. So, yeah, he's a thief. Wait, you're accusing him of stealing coat hangers from your house? I'm not assuming that that happened. I know that happened. He did it. You sound very angry about these hangers being taken. Would you be angry if you invited someone back to your house after a really nice date and then found out that they stole things from you? Yeah. Yeah, I think you'd be. Yeah, but I. I guess. But I don't know why. Hangers just doesn't hit me that hard. Me neither. It's so weird. They're my things. I only just met. We have hung out for, like, a couple hours, and I invited him back to my place. Like, why do you take my hangers? Yeah, it's a really valid question. It makes no sense. It's weird and sketchy and dumb, that is. You didn't notice anything else missing from your house? It was just the hangers. You keep saying my hangers, like it's like it's not a big deal. But he just took them. He didn't leave a note. He didn't say anything about it. He just took my hangers. That is weird, man. Yeah, I guess it is weird. I don't know why you would take hangers. Don't you wanna know why he would take hangers? Don't you know why he would wanna steal your hangers? It's just. No, I don't care why he did it. I don't Care how he tries to excuse himself. He's lucky I didn't call the police. Oh, that would be a call. Yeah, I'd love to see him get arrested for that. Yeah, that's true though, right? I probably. Yeah, you probably could get him arrested. I'm kind of wondering why he would steal your hangers. So I think we should ask him, Juliana, cause he's on the phone listening right now and wants to talk to you.

Finish your homework before doing anything else. I hear music coming from your room. I know you're not working. I did finish it, mom. I have nothing left to work on tonight.

Elizabeth, your brother needs a chaperone to his soccer game tonight, so I'm heading out with him in a few minutes. Make sure your homework is done before I get home. Your brother and I got some pizza earlier. There's a leftover slice or two on the counter. Okay, mom. Elizabeth, take your brother to his soccer practice. I just got home from work and I'm tired. It's Aaron's birthday party today. Mom, I just got here. I missed her last party. Can dad please take Ben? Your father is working now. Don't talk back to me. Take Ben to practice now. Fine.

Elizabeth, Ben needs to borrow your iPad for an hour. His died, and I promised him an hour of screen time. Mom, I'm taking notes on it right now. Can I give it to him once I'm done? You still have that notebook Grammy gave You. For your birthday last year, right? Yes, why? Well, that means you can take paper notes then. It's one hour. Don't be selfish. Mom, Prom is this weekend. Could we maybe go dress shopping this Friday? I've got to take Ben to all of his games this week. Ask your father. Okay. Did you push your brother? He took my phone, wouldn't give it back, and when I tried to take it, he bit me. So, yes, I pushed him and he dropped it. Not hard, just hard enough to lose grip on the phone. Apologize to your brother. I got called into work early today. Can you pick up Ben's cake? His party is at 5:30. That cake can't be late. Okay, mom. Also, I paid for it 50% up front. I'm going to need you to pay for the other 50% when you get there. How much was his cake? $400. Please pay the $200. Mom, I don't have that money right now. Elizabeth, this is Ben's 12th birthday. This is important to him. Maybe you've been spoiled with too many indulged birthdays of your own. Buy the cake. I'll see about paying you back this week. Mom, I don't mean to push, but it has been two weeks since I bought Ben's cake. And I'm in charge of bringing in a food from a country. I'm studying for my history class this week. Could you please pay me back? Elizabeth, I cannot right now. Ben needed New cleats and shin guards for practice. Mom, this class is really important to me. Please. And soccer is really important to your brother. His coaches say he has real promise. And history is important to me. Mom, I think I might really wanna pursue this. I don't have time for this right now, Elizabeth. Mom, can I talk to you about something? I'm busy right now. Elizabeth, call your father. He's at home right now. That's okay. Mom, I wanted to tell you that I got an art history internship. It's a virtual paid internship. I'll be working three days a week for three hours each day.

What? Of course not. Why are you asking me this? Because when you went to the bathroom last night, you got a message from settings on the imessage app. Wait, why were you going through my phone? Do not turn this on me. Who is that and what are you guys messaging? It's just some tech support agent helping me with my phone. Relax, babe. It's nothing. Oh, really? Luckily, I knew you would lie to me, so I unlocked your phone and checked your messages with him. And why is your tech support agent sending you willy pics that you hearted? Jake's got a better life than you. Anyway, we're done. Wait. Not only did you cheat on me, but it was with Jake, my childhood best friend. I've known him for the past 17 years. How could you do this to me? He's far better and pretty much everything than you anyways. Have fun being lonely. How could you do this to me, bro? Over a girl? What happened to bros before hoes? So you found out. You want a cookie now? I'll remember that. I need your help to get back at Jake. What happened? He's your best friend. Can't explain right now, but are you in or out? Tight. What do you need me to do? Jake has a business meeting with his boss tomorrow. Take a bunch of leeches and plant them in his boss's suit. Jack always carries his Laptop in a suitcase. So put a jar of leeches in there. And when he takes his computer out to show his boss the work, his boss sees the jar of leeches and fires him. He gets fired next since Sarah probably left him since he lost his job. Now Jake spends a ton of time on discord to cope. Make a e girl account and catfish him. Get to know him and send him frequent selfies of some Instagram model. Now that you got his trust, ask him to send you money to fly you out. He's a SIMP so he'll fall for it. Once he sends it. Block him. Donate this money to a racist charity under his name. Take a screenshot of this and upload it to TikTok so that companies see that he's racist. He can't get a job in business anymore. He's got to work in fast food now and he's probably gonna be a cook since he loves to cook. It's 100% gonna be McDonald's since that's his favourite fast food. So go to his joint and order a 10 piece Mcnugget through the driveway. Once you get the 10 piece, eat three of them and complain to the manager that you didn't get 10. He'll get a warning with this. Do this a few more times across two days, but on Doordash with different names. He gets fired and has a bad reference since he can't even work properly in fast food now. We can't even get a job, so he's homeless. Go up to him with a challenge. Tell him that if he can swallow a spoon of cinnamon in under one minute without water, add on that if he does this, gets $10,000. He's gonna take this offer up since he's homeless. Take your phone out and start recording to make it seem like it's a real YouTube video. Once he puts the cinnamon in his mouth, run for your dear life. Avenge me.

Lucas, that is the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard. Just admit you were too lazy to do the project. Take your failing grade like a man. Your family will be so disappointed in you now you won't get your scholarship, and they'll have to come out of pocket. I promise I did the project. Bailey just ruined it because I didn't want to get back with her. I don't want to hear it, Lucas. You know what else Bailey told me, Miss Geisha? She said she paid you $300 to set us up as partners. An accusation like that is blasphemous. I would never take money from a student. It's just fate that you two were paired together. Two slackers in my class. Makes sense. You think I'm gullible, Miss Geisha? Bailey told me. I'm telling the principal this if you don't make this situation right. Tell Mr. Reynolds with what proof? All you have is a message from Bailey. I'll make this work. In my favor. Whatever. Just come back to class and take your failing grade. Oh, where are you, Lucas? I just walked into class, and you're not here. I miss seeing your cute face.

Ha ha ha! I'll be sitting here waiting for you to come back, my king. Shut it! Mr. Reynolds, I need your help. What's going on, Lucas? Miss Geisha paired me up with my ex for the final physics project. I told her I didn't want to work with Bailey? Because she cheated on me with the entire football team. The whole football team? Dang. Yeah, but it gets worse. I needed this project to get a scholarship and take the load off my struggling family. Bailey flirted with me the entire time and distracted me from working. I did 90% of the project and dropped it off at her house to finish the rest. She fed it to her dog because I didn't want to be with her. Oh my god. How could she do something so vindictive? It gets even worse. She told me she paid Miss Geisha $300 to pair us together. Isn't that breaking some kind of school rule? That's definitely against school board guidelines. That is absolutely unacceptable behavior. But do you have any proof of this? Bailey sent me a message saying she gave Miss Geisha 300. That's not sufficient proof. Luca, I'm sorry. There has to be something we can do. I'm sorry, but there's nothing concrete enough to act on. Wait. Check the cameras. Maybe there's something. Alright, but I doubt we'll find anything.

What does he look like? If I see him around, I might say hello. Then what? Tell him all about your piano. So funny. That's him. He has mid. Excuse me? That's my man you're talking about. I'm just saying he's mid. I'm allowed my own opinion. Well, either way, he is much better looking than you. You don't even know what I look like. Send me a photo. Gulp. What? Nothing. I just didn't expect you to look like that. Why? Because I'm a piano boy. Honestly? Yeah. Either way, my man is still better. Mm hmm. Anyway, I gotta go. Dad is calling me. But I'll talk later, piano boy. She had a neighbor. Hey, neighbor. I have something to tell you. What is it? It's about your boyfriend. You're not jealous of him, are you? What? No. The thing is, I saw him with a few other girls at the skate park. Oh, really? Probably just his friends. They look more than friends to me. What do you mean by that? I don't know. He was just very touchy. Okay, well, you stop it. Huh? You are obviously jealous and trying to give him a bad image. Um, I'm really not. I couldn't Care less. Just thought I would tell you since we are neighbors after all. Whatever. I don't believe you. Fine. Go down to the skate park and see for yourself then. Ugh, you know what? Fine, I will. Then me and him are coming home, and you can just keep your eyes to yourself. I was just trying to help. He doesn't seem like the man you think. We will see. Comment for part two.

The entire ceremony was shut down. Paramedics rushed in. You see, she'd always been an attention seeking hoe. During my first piano recital when I was 12, she fainted in the front row. Prom night when I was crowned queen, heart attack, scare. Every single monumental event. And it wasn't until three years later when I got the invite to her baby shower that I finally saw an opportunity to bite back. My husband was beside me when I opened it and I immediately started rubbing up against him. We're trying for a baby, I whispered into his ear. Really? I thought we were waiting. Now we're trying now. The math was specific. I had maybe three cycles to get pregnant. For the timing to work, her party was in three months. Had to act fast. First test, negative. I stared at that single line. Second month, negative again. I was lying in the dark room with gel on my belly when the ultrasound tech went quiet. Move the wand around. Congratulations, it's twins. I laughed, actually laughed. Then next few months, I became Melissa's biggest cheerleader. Anything to get her hyped up for what that hoe thought would be her big moment. Oh, my Gosh, girl, you need a countdown on Instagram? I'll design it. I posted daily, five months until my sister becomes a mom. I insisted on inviting everyone I knew, promising that they'd all bring her gifts and attention. I knew I was doing the right thing when she posted her baby name online. Delfina Aurora, a name I'd written in my diary when I was 15, a name I'd.

When the guard entered the code, his fingerprints would leave smudges on four keys. Now that he knew the four numbers, he calculated all 24 possible combinations and began testing each one. Next, he crumpled up tissues, squeezed toothpaste into the center, made dozens of these, then wrapped them in another sheet of paper and press them tight. That became his tool.

But they say after all they've been through, they had to try something. This was Pam and Mark Teters home after Hurricane Milton. The couple had only just moved from North Carolina three months before. And while the flooding from Milton is long gone, the teters still have standing water on parts of their property. From rain storms that happened after. It's tearing up their lives. Pam approached the county several times for help, even offering a few suggestions, like building A berm around the retention pond next door, or digging their ditches. And that we were the lowest point in this area, and that all the water would. Would flow to us. That's when they decided to take tens of thousands of dollars out of their savings to build their own burn. It was our last option. We talked to several contractors, and they suggested that we do that.

Got chalked at 8:30. I came back at 12:30, the truck markers still on it. So I wrote it for a two hour violation. But Brennan is violating the Constitution. Michigan who argued that marking tires, it's similar to police secretly putting a GPS on a vehicle without a proper warrant. That's a violation of the 4th Amendment right against unreasonable searches. I don't mind at all. I think it's a chalk wipes off very, very easily. So it's not a problem. The court, which covers four Midwest states, ruled that now a warrant is needed because the purpose of marking tires is to raise revenue and not for public safety. Ken Kissell, who owns Live Wire Security in Irvington, says the chalking keeps three spots open for customers. So somebody can run in, run out and not have to worry about getting a ticket for just being parked for 5 minutes like you do with a lot of other towns that have parking meters. In the meantime, the village is considering more high tech options.

And two others stopped right in front of us at the last minute. It happened again and again the next two days. I feel sick watching these cars not stop. Just makes me sick. Both Anna and Sherry say they've called the Orange County Sheriff's Office to report the problem, but they claim nothing happened until we showed up. We called both the Orange County School District and the Orange County Sheriff's Office about what we caught on tape. And on Thursday morning, Anna shot this cell phone video showing a white van blowing right by the bus and right by an Orange County deputy parked nearby surveying the scene. She says they were back Friday morning handing out tickets. Can you tie your shoe? But these moms say what they would really like to see is a better spot for the bus stop.

Every day, Anna Price tries to stop cars from driving past the stop school bus on her daughter's route over and over and over again. So we staked out the bus stop for 4 days last week. The first day we saw three cars drive by the flashing lights. And the next day wasn't any better. Hey, as we caught two more drivers on camera speeding right past the stop school bus and two others stopped right in front of us at the last minute. It happened again and again the next two days. I feel sick watching these cars not stop just makes me sick. Both Anna and Sherry say they've called the Orange County Sheriff's Office to report the problem, but they claim nothing happened until we showed up. We called both the Orange County School District and the Orange County Sheriff's Office about what we caught on tape. And on Thursday morning, Anna shot this cell phone video showing a white van blowing right by the bus and right by an Orange County deputy parked nearby surveying the scene. She says they were back Friday morning handing out tickets. Can you tie your shoe? But these moms say what they would really like to see is a better spot for the bus stop.

A 92 year old homeowner shot and killed an intruder, claiming that the thieves had chosen the wrong target. He was a World War 2 veteran. That night, 92 year old Jones heard a commotion coming from the basement and picked up his 22 caliber rifle to guard by the door. When 24 year old Adam Maxwell, along with his accomplices Ryan Alton and Donnie De Millett attempted to forcefully break into the living room, Jones shot Maxwell in the chest and he fell to the ground on the spot. Two accomplices then dragged Maxwell out, drove at high speed, and called for help. They may think that a 92 year old person would be an easy target to achieve. What they didn't realize was that Jones was a retired US Air Force veteran who had participated in the maintenance work of the Enola Gay bomber. It was this plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Jones stated that his farm has been robbed multiple times, resulting in the loss of valuable items and cash. He admitted that he could no longer bear it and that this behavior was in self defense. Do you think this can be considered self defense? Welcome to share your opinions in the comment section.

Following the incident, dolphin did not eat for three days and was deeply distressed about committing such a grave sin. Subsequently, the Marine show management called in veterinarians to check on the orca. Upon examination, they announced that the orca was severely unwell. The orca, which is a type of dolphin, is known to think like humans and possesses a highly advanced brain. It felt ashamed of its mistake. After that, the orca suddenly went underwater and did not resurface. When two hours passed without it coming up for air, the Marine show management called in veterinarians again. The team checked on the orca and found that its breathing had ceased. It had passed away. The Marine show management incurred a loss of $200 million in a week because they paid $50 million in compensation to Jessica's family, while the orca itself was valued at $150 million. What do you think was the orca's decision to take its life, justified or not? Let me know.

And this is a totally different ice cream truck, as you can see. This person posted this at nine thirty eight PM this truck is white. The other one was a dark blue. And there's no reason to be selling ice cream at this hour. Now, if you don't already know, there's a lot of reports in Virginia of over 50 kids missing. And the parents keep on posting videos of this ice cream truck and a few others in the area driving around to late hours. I think it's about time for the ice cream truck guys to start making videos showing that there's no reason for us to think that they're up to anything else but selling ice cream. Cause people wanna know what the heck is going on. Your man is parked outside my house at 9 o'clock at night. Like there's no kids out there. Nobody's getting ice cream. He's just sitting there playing his loud ass music and he's been there for like 15 minutes. And parents want answers because there's literally no reason for children to be going up strange men in vehicles buying ice cream from them in the middle of the night.

But the most shocking part wasn't its return. It was what they found inside. What the rescuers saw shook the entire world. In 1950, a commercial flight took off from Los Angeles heading to Miami with 65 people on board. Everything seemed normal until the unthinkable happened. The plane vanished from the radar. Communication with the pilots was suddenly cut off. There were no emergency signals, no signs of a crash. For weeks, hundreds of rescuers searched thousands of miles by land and sea, but found nothing. No wreckage, no fuel stains. Not a single clue. After six months, the investigation was closed. The plane was declared lost and all passengers presumed dead. Decades later, in 1992, something incredible happened. An old aircraft appeared on the radar of an international airport. Same flight number, same registration code. It landed as if nothing had happened. And when emergency teams boarded the aircraft, they found something impossible to explain. Everything was caught on video. Do you want to see that footage? Tap the plus sign and comment the word plane for part two.

The first day, we saw three cars drive by the flashing lights. And the next day wasn't any better. Hey! As we caught two more drivers on camera speeding right past the Stop School bus. And two others stopped right in front of us at the last minute. It happened again and again the next two days. I feel sick watching these cars not stop. Just makes me sick. Both Anna and Sherry say they've called the Orange County Sheriff's Office to report the problem, but they claim nothing happened until we showed up. We called both the Orange County School District and the Orange County Sheriff's Office about what we caught on tape. And on Thursday morning, Anna shot this cell phone video showing a white van blowing right by the bus and right by an Orange County deputy parked nearby surveying the scene. She says they were back Friday morning handing out tickets. Can you tie your shoe? But these moms say what they would really like to see is a better spot for the bus stop.

This 12 year old boy randomly took the life of a 9 year old child and then asked the judge for the death penalty. But after hearing the full story behind the boy's life, the victim's family not only forgave him, they even hoped for his recovery. On a September afternoon in 2019, Jamarion Lawhorn was afraid to go home. he randomly chose Connor Verkerk as his victim at a local playground, stabbing him three times. Rather than fleeing, Jamarion calmly called 9 1 1 and waited for the police to arrive and arrest him. During the court hearings, Lawhorn's lawyer explained the disturbing circumstances of his life. From an early age, he had been severely neglected, suffering ongoing physical abuse from his biological mother and stepfather. Medical examinations revealed numerous bruises and signs of severe malnutrition, clearly resulting from prolonged abuse at home. The abuse jimmarion endured was so severe that he no longer wanted to return to the place he was supposed to call home. Shockingly, in court, he begged the judge to sentence him to death. After hearing his heartbreaking story, even the judge became emotional, choking back tears. Remarkably, Connor's parents forgave the 12 year old and expressed sincere hope for his rehabilitation. Ultimately, Jamaarian Lawhorn was found guilty of second degree murder. Because he was still a minor, he was sentenced to remain in a juvenile facility until age 21.

So I spent the last year completely transforming myself. Lost 40 pounds, Learned how to do my makeup properly, got a haircut that actually suits my face. For the first time in my life, I felt genuinely confident. Journey wasn't easy. I'd wake up at 5:00am to hit the gym before work, meal prep every Sunday, and honestly cried in my car more times than I can count when the scale wouldn't budge. But slowly something shifted. Not just my body, but how I carried myself, how I looked people in the eye, how I finally felt like I deserve to take up space in this world. Lisa and I have been best friends since college. We're talking eight years of friendship here. She was my biggest cheerleader through everything. You're glowing. She'd text after I'd post gym selfies. I'm so proud of you. Her husband, Mark, was always nice, but we barely talked before. He was just Lisa's husband. You know, present at game nights but never really part of our conversations. Then suddenly he's texting me, hey, could you babysit Emma and Jake tonight? Lisa's working late again. At first I thought it was sweet. Their kids are 7 and 5 and I love them to pieces. I always said yes because honestly, babysitting beat another night of Netflix alone. But the requests got weird. He'd ask me to watch them on nights when I could literally See Lisa's car in their driveway. When I'd arrive, she'd be upstairs taking a nap or running errands. Mark would linger when picking up the kid.

She gave our daughter's bus driver cookies. Some important details. My wife is very shy but enjoys giving and is all gung ho about showing appreciation to workers she assumes aren't appreciated or recognized. She tries to pass these beliefs onto our kids because she's too silent to show her appreciation. She does it through gifts, usually baked goods. I've been embarrassed about it in the past. Our oldest rode the bus for the first time. My wife was waiting at the stop with our daughter and had her hand the bus driver a bag of homemade cookies. Then when she picked her up from the stop in the afternoon, she gave a bag to the afternoon driver. I asked why she did that when she could easily just have said thank you and left it at that. She said the bus drivers work so hard having to comfort all the nervous kids and handling the unruly ones while driving. They deserve more than a thanks. I reminded her that this has embarrassed me in the past and I think her behaviors are too extreme. I wouldn't want gifts from someone I don't know. She ignored how I felt. I contacted some people in my life to see if I was just crazy and most of my friends and my mom agree. My wife's way of showing thanks just makes everyone uncomfortable. Am I the asshole? Yeah, you are. You Mousy, unforgettable man. Of course, your friends and your family are going to like validate what you're feeling. What do you mean? That's the nicest thing ever. I like this woman's a fucking dream. Yeah. And worse comes to worse. They don't like the cookies. They throw them away. They throw them away. You are a man who is the color gray.

I told him regardless, I still plan to host the event after he tried talking me out of it and suggested we go out together. He threw a fit after he suggested bringing his guy friends to join us, and I refused since this is not how gnis work. He called me a sexist and misogynistic for having a girls night in and making it so obvious. Instead of being ashamed of myself, he said that my mentality will cause Me issues in the future.

Oh, man. Hello. I'm a 29 year old, happily married. My husband and I are college educated, have respectable, stable jobs, own a home in a nice neighborhood. We're basically as prepared as anyone can be to start a family. I'm almost nine months pregnant with our first child. The problem is that 11 years ago when my husband was a freshman in college, he was arrested for possession of marijuana. He pled guilty and did his time in probation without a problem, passing every drug test along the way. He has not touched any other illegal substance since and we rarely even drink and haven't at all in over a year. I have no criminal record. It was a stupid mistake he made as a foolish 18 year old and he's worked hard to put it behind him. Someone has apparently contacted child services in our area. This accusation is being taken very seriously because of my husband's record. We have been as cooperative as could be with our case worker. We've been interviewed. Our home has been examined and she found nothing remotely serious or incriminating. We have both taken tests and passed. Our case worker says everything looks just fine so far. Unfortunately, she also says that there's still the possibility that our child could be taken from us in the labor and delivery ward. I was devastated and horrified to hear that when I asked Why she said it was, quote, not up to her and we'll have to wait and see.

My husband Jared. I don't know. What if she said something really bad? It could have been really mean. You're about to see, but you. That doesn't justify commenting on someone's body. This is true. My husband Jared and I have been married for three years. He's currently out of work. Used to work at a high paying job, but got kicked out of the company over a fight with a coworker. And I'm the one paying for rent and utilities. We dedicate some time to seeing his family weekly. They don't know he's unemployed because he thought they'll see him as a failure, especially his mom. So he told me to keep it a secret. Last night we were sitting eating dinner at the table, his cousin was talking about his fiance going to Brazil to do a boob job. Jared asked if he was serious, then flattered future sister in law's boobs, saying they're perfect and that he didn't understand why she'd get a boob job. He then turned to me, stared at my chest while I was eating. I have a flat chest. I'm insecure about it, but don't do anything about it, obviously, and said quote, hey, why don't you get a boob job? You're the one who needs it the most. His mom gasped and was like, Jared, it then turned to him and said quote, I'll get a Boob job. Once you get an actual job. Since you've been unemployed for six months now. He stared at me honestly, like he deserves it. His mom began questioning him about being unemployed, and he denied, denied, denied. Then he kept lying, admitted it was true. It got awkward, with his mom scolding him and others shaming him for it and for hiding it.

She plans to hold her baby during the ceremony and even feed him if she needs to. Oh, no, this lady's gonna whip out her tit. No, you know where I stand on all these things. I told her she should feel welcome to have her new little baby with her during the day while we are getting ready, but when it comes to walking down the aisle, I would not like her to be holding the baby. Yep, the baby could cry, poop, need to eat, etcetera, etcetera. Literally, she has insisted that she will be holding her baby during the wedding, otherwise she will not be in the wedding. Go off in Addition to the baby holding dilemma, she has jokingly told me that she will call me a bad aunt in her wedding speech or she will get her other kids to object in the middle of my wedding. That's so rude. I think she is trying to be funny, but all of these comments are frustrating and hurting my feelings. Hmm. Yeah. Sisters out of the wedding in my book. Yep. Agreed.

I have never known him to do anything like this, but I noticed he started acting a little strange around a month, maybe a month and a half ago. He started putting fruit on the floor in the garden, and I thought it was a bit weird, but he said he was feeding the mice family, so I thought it was sweet and helped him do so. He started being really nice to me around two weeks ago and making me food, baking me cakes and stuff, which he never usually cooks, ever. So I was so happy he found a hobby. I did notice sometimes I felt sick and dizzy after eating, and I just put it down to lack of sleep, slash hormones. A friend of my partners came into my work today and said he needed to speak to me when I was free. He told me that my partner has been collecting slugs from the garden and putting them in my food, blending them up. He sent this friend pictures of bags of slugs that he had collected and the pictures of blended slugs. I feel really sick to my stomach. I don't understand why he did this. This is so out of character of him. I asked him Why, he was doing it, and he accused me of snooping through his messages, which I would never do.

He also was more distant with affection and very secretive with his phone. And when I checked it, he had changed his passcode. So I checked his laptop and the same thing, change and password. We had always shared all that information even when we changed it. So it didn't feel right. I started to feel like he was having an affair. And a coworker agreed that his actions seemed odd. She suggested I hide a camera at home, especially as I travel for work. After a lot of internal debate, I decided to do as she said and bought a camera that I could watch through my phone as I prepared for a short business trip. I hid it in our living room at an angle that covered most of the room but mainly aimed at the top of the door so I could see if anyone picked him up or came in with him. When I checked it a few hours ago, I was horrified and devastated to see my husband kissing my son.

What? I, 24 female, and my fiance, 24 male, have been together since our sophomore year of college. So around five years. Now, for context, my mom had an affair with a coworker when I was 16, leading to my parents divorce. She has been single ever since. Sadly, my fiance's mom passed two years ago due to cancer and his dad has been single since. My fiance proposed last year, but our wedding was delayed due to covid. Three months ago in January 2021, we decided it was time to have our families meet for the first time to discuss our upcoming wedding. This went well. This morning, out of the blue, my mom called me and announced that she had eloped. I was shocked as she had not been dating anyone to my knowledge. Upon questioning, it turns out that she and my fiance's dad had been dating in secret since that meeting in January and had married in secret yesterday, making my fiance my step brother.

I posted this originally on Am I the asshole and had been told that this would fit perfectly here since my aunt is the entitled parent. My husband and I are finally expecting our rainbow baby after years of infertility and multiple miscarriages. It's safe to say we and our family very freaking excited. My mom is probably the most excited. She's been planning our baby shower and making decorations for months. She's been the biggest help during this exciting yet scary pregnancy. A few weeks ago my aunt told my mother and I that my cousin is pregnant. We are very happy for her. However, my aunt said their plan is to announce her pregnancy at my baby shower since we are having a big party anyways. She said it's not a big deal and we both can share the day. I said absolutely not because we have been waiting for this day forever and it should be all about me and my rainbow baby. My mother is on my side and told my aunt that they better not announce anything at the party. My aunt dropped it and nothing else was said. Last Saturday was my baby shower. It was everything I've waited for. Everything is going good. No one has announced my cousin's pregnancy. When it was time for us to eat my cake, my aunt said hold on, hold on Everyone. And went outside to her car to grab something. That was the moment I knew something was up. My mother and I follow her outside, and my aunt decided to bring a cake announcing my cousin's pregnancy and some presents for my cousin. My mother immediately told my aunt that she will not be bringing those back into the rec center, and they will not be ruining my day. My aunt started throwing a fit, screaming, this is a baby shower! It's for babies. Cousin is having a baby, too, so this day should be about her, too. My

Oh, yeah, I imagine a lot of these look like grapes and have like little stems that are connecting each one. Interesting. So sometimes if I still have some trapped under there, you probably had one of these that have gotten inflamed before, huh? Yeah. Yeah, sometimes they can get inflamed though. Actually, I will say that sometimes if I leave a little part of one in there, I haven't really had people call say that they got inflamed. So sometimes if I can't even get the sack, I don't necessarily see it coming back, but we might put a stitch in there.

I was trying on my new micro bikini, loving the way it accentuates my TTS. I was having a lot of fun posing, taking videos of pulling my top down, pretending to be a little w H R. Nothing makes me as h R E as showing off, even if it's only via pics. I decided I needed some new toys, so I started browsing Love Honey for a toy that I could keep inside myself while I'm gaming or while in public. Not to get myself off, but just to keep myself horny and wet and waiting for it. Not that I need any help doing that, but it's a fantasy I've had for a while. While I was there I also spotted some Clover clamps that I absolutely had to buy. I love clamping and torturing my cute little nipples. The basic clamps I had previously just weren't hitting the spot. These ones looked scary and I couldn't help but start to touch myself while I imagined using them. Eventually I got carried away and made myself CM right on my PC chair while browsing intimacy toys. But that didn't satisfy me at all. I needed it rough. And I needed a pee pee. My silly orgasm just made me a junior. So I text my landlord slash f buddy who I'd be sending the pics To. And I asked what he wanted to do to me

I don't want either of those options and I'm feeling bratty, so I reply that they're both boring and so I'm going to have a nap instead. A few seconds later, I hear him coming up the stairs, so I jump into bed and pretend to be asleep, my wimp dripping in anticipation of my punishment. He comes upstairs, enters my room, and immediately forces his pee pee into my throat. I love the feeling of him using me roughly and not getting me a chance to breathe. When I pull back for a breath, I see that he's got the electro knife in his hand. Instant fear and instant arousal run through me. I push myself back into his pee pee, making sure to throat his pee pee as deep as I can, while the fear of being shocked goes straight to my crotch. After taking it deep for as long as I can, he tells me to bend over. I immediately comply with his orders, presenting my SS for whatever he wants to do with it. The anticipation makes me feel like my body is on fire, and I effing love it. My head is fuzzy with arousal. He lands a hard slap on my SS, but instead of squirming away, I push into him. Instead, more blows rain down, and I can feel myself going deeper and deeper into the pleasure with each one.

So here's how far they've got in 2023. Firstly, according to the project's executive director, he estimates that the vital infrastructure for the city which includes important road, it's offices, hospitals, logistics hubs, etc. It's roughly 20% complete. They say they already have 3,000 employees from 90 countries and more than 60,000 construction workers. In October last year, a drone video went viral showing diggers begin the massive job of excavating a staggering 100 and 70km of ground before they can even start construction. So if you fast forward to October this year, surprisingly looking at Google Maps, you can pretty much see the excavation outlines for the full, full length of the linear city. In fact, according to Middle Eastern news reports, the lines hidden Marina alone is the largest excavation project in the world with about 1 million cubic meters of earth being moved every single week. And beyond just excavation, it's also been reported that they began installing thousands of piles which are essential strong just that help transfer the way to the building above to the ground, thus helping support it. Offshoot community situated close to the line have also had significant progress and are reportedly acting as fully functioning towns with hundreds of housing units, full mosque, post office, grocery stores, a bus station and even a Starbucks. Their planned transportation system has had some pretty significant changes because It has been shortened by 30 km and they have reduced the amount of stops it will have from 48 to just 9. The entire project is still being primarily funded by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which as of 2023 stands at roughly $700 billion. However, that some also has to fund at least three other major projects that they're simultaneously working on. The line is still scheduled to be complete by an ambitious date of 2030. And because what they're trying to create is quite literally unprecedented, it's hard to say whether these targets are ludicrous or achievable. I guess all we can do is wait and see.

Experts say that these cracks are being caused by magma flowing underground and coming closer to the surface, which signals that a volcanic eruption now appears to be imminent. Now, the reason people are concerned is that the last major volcanic eruption in Iceland caused such a massive ash cloud that prompted the largest global aviation shutdown since World War 2.

No one saw that she was a young mother, tired, watched, judged, living in a prison made of flash bulbs. After losing custody of her children, Britney walked into a salon in Los Angeles. She sat down, looked in the mirror, and shaved her head alone, clippers in hand, while security begged her to stop. The next night, she was surrounded by photographers at a gas station. She stepped out of the car holding an umbrella and struck the window of one of their vehicles. The image went global, and everyone said, she went crazy. She needs help. It's the end. But no one asked what she was feeling. She screamed, but not with her voice. She screamed with her eyes, with her shaved head, with that umbrella. And the world took pictures. Months later, Britney was forcibly institutionalized. She lost the right to control her own life, her assets, her career, her decisions. All taken from her. She became the legal prisoner of her own name. And the world only understood Over a decade too late.

In 1957, a boy named Jason Voorhees drowned at Camp Crystal Lake. He was 11th, deformed, bullied, and couldn't swim. The counselors were distracted. His body was never recovered. A year later, two staff members were found murdered, throat slit, bodies dumped near the lake. No suspects, no arrests. The camp shut down. Locals blamed the mother, Pamela Vorhis. They said she snapped, that she blamed the camp for Jason's death. But the real fear began years later. In 1980, Crystal Lake reopened. And within 48 hours, everyone was dead. Nine victims stabbed, mutilated, beheaded. The last survivor swore she killed a woman, Jason's mother. But before blacking out, she saw someone else. A man. Tall, silent, wearing a hockey mask. Police covered it up as an accident, but locals knew better. Jason didn't drown. Or maybe he did. But something came back. He was massive, rotting, and completely silent. Every attempt to reopen the camp ends in blood. Reports of tents slashed open from the outside, cabins burned, bodies never recovered. The state sealed the area, changed the name. But hikers still go missing. And every year, someone hears breathing by the lake. Heavy, close and getting closer.

Her name was Amy Winehouse, the woman who brought soul back to the charts. The raspy voice, the iconic eyeliner, and the lyrics that screamed for help disguised as music. From a young age, she battled addiction. But while she begged for help, the industry begged for more shows, more tours, more money. Instead of treatment, she got flash bulbs and contracts. Her breakdowns became memes. Her relapses headlines. Her Pain. Entertainment. In 2,011, at just 27, Amy stepped onto the stage in Belgrade. She was disoriented, stumbling over her own words. The crowd booed, but no one stopped the show. She was taken offstage, but it was already too late. Her final performance became global humiliation, and no one really looked at her. Weeks later, she was found lifeless at home with four times the fatal limit of alcohol in her blood. Alone in the same house where she had recorded so many songs about loneliness. They say she died from excess, but maybe she died from abandonment. And even now, years after her last chord, on every corner of London and every scratched vinyl, Amy's voice still echoes, begging for someone to finally listen.

They told her they were going to play a game. Instead, they stabbed her 19 times and left her to die. When police caught them, their explanation shocked the world. They said they did it for Slender Man. A massive, faceless figure, impossibly tall, with limbs like branches and no eyes. Just a blank, pale face. He doesn't speak, he doesn't chase. He waits. It started as a creepy pasta in 2009, a fictional horror story made for the internet. But something about Slenderman spread like a virus. Kids began reporting sightings. Drawings appeared in schools, and online forms were flooded with whispers. That he lived in the woods and called out to children when no one was watching. The girls claimed they had seen him. That he stood at the edge of their dreams. That he would hurt their families if they didn't offer someone. The girl they stabbed survived barely. When police searched the girl's belongings, they found notebooks filled with drawings, tall trees, black suits, empty faces, and the words he watches. Some still believe Slenderman isn't just a story. That when a child disappears in the woods, he's still there.

While the world tried to take everything his family had built. Over generations, he faced politicians, corporations, developers, and even the government to protect every inch of land he inherited. He didn't fight for money, but for legacy. For his family name. His children grew up under pressure and silence. One was a soldier, one a lawyer. And his daughter. All fire and fury. Enemies came from all sides. But the worst battles happened inside the house. Betrayal, secrets, power plays. Every year, someone tried to take the ranch. And every time, John fought back harder. When force wasn't enough, he stepped into politics, became governor. Thought he could protect it all from inside. But that's where it ended. Shot inside his own home. Betrayed by the son he tried to save. The youngest gave up the war. He sold the land for $1, giving it back to the tribe. Not out of weakness, but because he saw the truth. The fight had already taken everything that mattered. That's how the Dutton empire died. No headlines, no glory. Just a legacy buried in the soil. And a ranch that cost too much to keep.

Before the hooks, before fame, he was just Nathan Hale, a pastor's son at church chorister, who sang about heaven, but lived in the hell of the streets of Long Beach, served in the army, and returned to the neighborhood without medals, without a job. So he, Snoop and Warren G formed a group, 2:13, recorded a tape in the basement. And someone took that tape to Doctor Dre. That's when everything changed. Nate didn't rhyme, but when he opened his mouth, everyone listened. He became the sound of the West Coast, the soul of G funk. He didn't need verses. Just one line, a melody, and the world stop, regulate, Lay Low. The next episode. Area codes. All the hits with the same label behind them, featuring Nate Dogg. But as his voice soared, his body fell. Heart attack. Then another. And more. Another. In 2011, he left silent, without applause, without a farewell chorus. But every time you hear that hold up or smoke weed, every day, he's the one there. Nate Dog didn't need a stage because he was the foundation of everyone's music. He wasn't the star, he was the foundation. The bridge between gangster rap and melody. Between the ghetto and eternity.

Before the 9 11, before the racetracks, there was just one man. Ferdinand Porsche. He wasn't a businessman. He was an engineer. Obsessed with speed, balance and precision. In the 1930s, he helped design the Volkswagen Beetle. Simple, affordable. A car for the people. But his dream was different. Not to build for everyone, but to build something perfect. In 1948, in a small garage in Austria, his son, Ferry Porsche, took that dream, turned it into metal. They called it the Porsche 3 5 6. It used beetle parts. It had just 40 horsepower, but it was light, fast, and it moved like nothing else. People didn't just drive it, they raced it. They won with it. That first car carried the DNA of everything. Porsche would become a company that never chased trends, only perfection. From a family workshop to the hills of Stuttgart, from dirt roads to Le Mans, Porsche wasn't built to impress. It was built to perform. And it all started with a father's vision and a son who refused to let it die.

We had a beautiful home. And I don't, I don't feel like I'm even at home. I feel like I'm in this, like I'm standing inside of a dumpster. The couple had rented their home through the website Airbnb. The offer was for three nights for four adults who claimed they were in Calgary for a wedding. According to their neighbors, a party bus showed up Saturday night. The family had no idea what was happening at their home until they received a text from a neighbor. On Monday morning, they arrived with police and discovered people were still inside. Finally, one girl cooperated, called cabs, woke up the people that were passed out. And we had about 20 people that filed out of our house at that time, which were the leftovers, and walked in at that point with the police to this, the home had been trashed. It's almost anger. It's just, I couldn't believe that somebody could do that in three days to a, to another person's home. Such a violation.

James is 16. He's disabled. He walks to and from work every single day. He doesn't cause any problems with anyone. So allegedly at the end of the night there is a throwaway bin that they put groceries in that they're gonna throw away, not use anymore. James ends up taking out the fruit cup from it every single night on his way home. The store manager, a male manager, I don't know his name, saw this and instead of saying something to James, decided to watch James for over two to three months take fruit cups. He then waited until the total of the fruit cups got up to $110 and then call the cops and got James arrested. As a store manager, instead of just simply going up to the 16 year old disabled kid and letting him know, hey, even though it's in the throw away bin, we don't want you to take it, you decide to watch him for over 3 months to build a case against him and call the cops and get him arrested for $110. I'm very big on people being held accountable for their actions.

When confronted by the police, the man said he was now in the business of transporting milk legally. The police searched and found nothing. So the man successfully transported a shipment of Rosewood worth over $100 million. The syndicate offered him $500,000 per truck load, but the man refused. He only wanted 4% of the profit. When the boss heard that there are still people who don't want more money, he immediately agreed. His friend was very puzzled. He could have earned half a million dollars, but the man only took 4%. He explained to his friend, if I take half a million dollars, I'll be their servant, but if I take 4% of the shares, I'm a partner. In the time that followed, the men did everything they could to get the shipments of Rosewood out of the country. They didn't just use milk trucks, wedding wagons, even an ambulance. The Rosewood was shipped out of the country. The men made a small fortune. But as time went on, the sheriff thought there was something fishy going on. That day, he came to check it out himself.

You see, since Jeffrey Dahmer was the one responsible for emptying all these parking meters in the first place, there was no way his boss would know if a stash was a few dollars short. The total amount was only counted after Jeffrey dropped these coins off. So from then on, he simply began stealing a bit here and there from every single parking meter he emptied. Since there were just so many meters in his area, before long, he was pocketing between 200 to 600 dollars in free quarters every week. Jeffrey probably thought he'd hit the Jackpot. There was no way for him to ever be caught. As it turns out, he was actually right. There really wasn't a way. But little did he know, it wouldn't even matter, since he would soon accidentally turn himself in. You see, every time Jeffrey was depositing his stolen coins, he would not only use the bank branch right near his parking meters, he would also still even be wearing his parking uniform. But somehow, these bank workers never ask questions. And it was only five years later that they finally became suspicious about his uniform and reported him to the police. By then, Jeffrey had already stolen more than $90,000. After he was arrested, he was forced to pay everything back and also spent 17 days in jail. Jeffrey Later said this ruined his life since he lost his job and his wife also left him.

But shortly afterwards, D. Simone says they cut him off. When he asked why, he says they told him it was because a witness came forward claiming he saw the ambulance using its lights and sirens before the crash.

Mister Howard went on a non marked I can trail we have signed. Your honor, is this one of your signs? Exactly. We're not able to monitor a babysit and handhold each guest, your honor. Mister Howard just wasn't paying attention. My life will never be the same because of you. I'm a surgeon. I need my hands to operate and I'm not able to do anything. Let me give you a legal lesson. The law says if a hazard like a cliff or an ocean or a swimming pool is open and obvious, then the business owner, the property owner need not warn you of what is open and obvious. A cliff is open and obvious and I rule in favor of the hotel and against you, doctor.

It is a full moon at dispatch. I think Mercury's back in reverse cowgirl and it's a Friday night. My dispatchers are gonna understand what kind of fresh hell that is. I have already taken several bullshit calls and my 9 1 1 line starts going off. I answer and the woman on the other end is just absolutely frantic. She's screaming, she's crying so I have to get her to calm down so she can tell me what's going on. I finally get her to calm down enough, ask her what's going on and she tells me her husband is laying in the bed not conscious, not breathing. So I go through a whole slew of medical questions with her and then I ask her what he was doing beforehand so I can relay very accurate information to EMS and her response kind of confuses the fuck out of me a little bit because she said he was just sitting here having a good time. My sister in Christ, i'mma need you to elaborate so much fucking further. And she tells me that at the time of expiration she was giving the hubby a little golf ball through a garden hose maneuver And at one point she noticed that his eyes were closed and that he wasn't moving, but she didn't think anything of it. So she kept going. And after 45 minutes, she realized that he wasn't finishing because he himself was in fact finished. I mean, I understand the dedication, but after 45 minutes, my ass is telling old boy to tag in Rosie, Palm, her five sisters and some lotion. So I get EMS dispatched and I walk old girl through CPR so she can perform life saving efforts until EMS can get on scene. EMS lets me know that they're on scene and they are gonna be taking over CPR. I get off the phone with her and 30 minutes later, EMS comes on the radio, let me know to call for a justice of the peace and whatever funeral home we have on call. And after all was said and done, one member of the EMS crew came back to dispatch and told me that the soldier was still in fact at attention when they got there and that she didn't know how the hell the wife was still walking cause apparently old boy was in possession of a deadly weapon. It wasn't funny at the time, but it's been almost a decade so I can laugh about it now. Gentlemen, y'all be careful when y'all ask us what that mouth do, cause some of them really do take souls.

Con Artist County 9 1 1, what is your emergency? And the person on the other end is screaming and crying and tell me I need somebody. This building. I look on my little map to see where the call is originating from, and it is coming from a mechanic shop. Okay, calm down, my little Cadillac convertible culprit. Why can you not get out of the building? And through snotsaves old boy tells me. I crawled in through the window of this building to see if there was anything good in here to take home. And now I'm trapped by an alligator. I beg your finest. Pardon? Did you just say an alligator? Yeah. It's got me trapped in the corner and I don't know how to get it away from me. Do I just hit it? What do I do? My brother in Christ, do not bear knuckle box Godzilla's third cousin. Cause I do not foresee that as a match you will win. However, I do foresee you losing parts that you are very attached to. But don't worry, I'm sending Crocodile Dundee and the Goon Squad your way. So Crocodile Dundee, aka the Game Warden, my donut Lovers, hoes, monkeys and trauma llamas all let me know that they are gonna be on scene at the large lizard meet and greet. And sure as shit it was a very large lizard. Cause Crocodile Dundee comes back over my radio to tell me that we are gonna need the cast to swamp people to get Rango's older brother out. Listen my little park ranger, there are only two groups I know to call for this and that is the Cajun Navy and people from Florida. But I'll do what I can. I wound up calling game boards from other jurisdictions. But they came and they got the 12 foot swamp monster out and oh boy. Well let's just say he wound up going to jail for breaking and entering.

There's not gonna be a rookie of the year race and I feel bad cause it's got nothing to do with how good Chet Holmgren is or has been. He's been ridiculously good. It's got everything to do with like the coverage gap between these two to Adam Silver has had ESPN and all of sports media cranking out Maximum Wembanyama propaganda for like 16 months at this point. Like look at this graphic from opening night for Wembanyama. This is a Cold War era propaganda poster. They stole this bar for bar from the USSR. I just casually being online without looking either of them up, I've seen more angles of Wembanyama blocking OG Ananoby's 3 point attempt than I have total Chet Holmes highlights in their entirety since he like hit the game winner on Cleveland a couple games ago. It really feels like barring injury, Chet would need to routinely be OKC's best player and they would need to be like a firm playoff team for voters to even entertain this, even though I think it has been close. Wemb, the propaganda is just insane.

According to history, we found answers for Defensive Player of the year and most improved. Now let's use similar historical standards to find the MVP, starting with the 25 players with the best odds right now on Draft Kings. The first cut is that 16 of the last 17 MVPs have LED their team in scoring by at least five points per game, with the only exception in that time frame being Steph Curry in 2015, and I think it's fair to say his candidacy was a little unique. Because this involves so much projection, I'll allow a little bit of leeway, but if you didn't lead your team by at least three points per game last season, you're getting cut. As a note, Dame and Giannis were within that three point buffer last season, but because we haven't seen them play with each other, I'm letting them both through this round. Next. 43 of the last 44 MVP's made the playoffs the year before they won the award, with the lone exception being Steve Nash in 2005. Whether we like it or not, MVP cases start well before opening night. So if you didn't play a

How is that LeBron can't do what I can do? They take, let me just go ahead and explain this for all the bots out there. All the bots in the comment, oh, bro was just trying to cope with the pain. Like, no, the point just flew over your head. There is shit that Kwame Brown can do, can say and tweet, can post about that if LeBron James were to ever post or tweet about, you will lose his biggest sources of income, will lose a lot of sponsorships, a lot of deals. His name would be put in the media in a negative light like they do Kyrie. There's a reason why every single time somebody talks about Kyrie, always have to joke around about how weird he is. There is a reason for that. Also, the simple fact that Kwame Brown can live a regular life, go outside, go to the mall, walk in the park without thousands of cameras being shoved in his face. LeBron James steps foot out his house, is on Twitter, wealthy and set for life and being rich and famous are two different things. Like I said, a lot of you bots not gonna understand this shit, man.

He made his return after injury last night, and he talked to everyone individually on the team today before his return and told them he loved and appreciated them. He told Jalen and Jason that he has their backs and he posted on Instagram with the caption felt good to be back out there with my brothers. Marcus Smart becomes eligible for trade tomorrow. It's also been leaked that the Mavericks show a lot of interest and Dallas is his hometown. He played great against the Wizards, but he did not look all that healthy. So my suspicion is that Brad Stevens took him aside and told him, hey, this is your last game. And so of course Marcus took the opportunity and played. Sorry, I gotta rep the Marcus Smart Jersey. Of course a lot of Celtics fans are gonna be happy about this, but for me, I'll be incredibly sad. He's been with us for the longest. He's showed us what hustle and loyalty look like, and it's been an honor to have him on our team. I went to his basketball camp and Eric, he became my favorite player. I actually beat him in a one on one. He's just really a great guy. And if he goes to Dallas, I hope we get Jalen Brunson, but.

And it's probably closer to the truth. The first two are obviously LeBron and Steph. I mean, they're otherworldly. I was drunk as hell yelling at my buddy that LeBron could beat Thanos. We had a serious ass conversation. His rebuttal is that Steph can snipe somebody across the country with no scope. I mean, my god, we didn't even pause the conversation. It ass, this is how wild the glazes gotten. Oh, crazy that they cannot be glazed. Now, the other two players are definitely questionable, but I do believe they have surpassed the threshold, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, because of one thing I've noticed. Every single person on this planet that has ever actually picked up a basketball loves these two. Do y'all remember when Anthony Edwards said that Katie was the goat? Then a whole bunch of high school players also said the same thing. You go to college and they also say the same thing. You ask those same dudes about Kyrie Irving and they act like he's better than Steph because they do shit on a basketball court you couldn't even imagine trying to do. Katie's skill set was so crazy. It did.

Now, Mozgov is no longer in the NBA, but when he was, he was a rotational center, and he was a good rotational center, but he was making rotational center money, so he wasn't getting a crazy bag or anything. He spends the early parts of his career being a solid backup, but then all of a sudden, during the 2014 2015 season, he catches a break. Turns out the Cavs with Kevin Love, Kyrie Irving, and LeBron James need a backup big, and guess who they trade for? He plays for the Cavs for the next two years and ends up being part of one of the most legendary championship teams in 2016. So he gets his ring in 2016, but then after that season he becomes a free agent. And that off season, because everybody was getting overpaid, he got a four year, 64 million dollar deal from the Lakers. So this dude was a backup by chance, wins one of the most legendary rings of all time, gets a ridiculously huge bag, and then gets to move from Cleveland to LA. If that is not the dream career path, I don't know what it.

They just got a lot more interesting as Donovan and Jimmy Butler, we're spotted at dinner together. Speaking of the Jazz, Rudy Gobert's name continues to be mentioned in trade rumors, and the Chicago Bulls are sounding like a potential destination in a blockbuster trade. It sounds like Zion Williamson is gonna sign the supermax in New Orleans. Five years and $182 million, and he said that he does want to stay there. Bradley Beal can also become a free agent, and he said that he wants to go where he can win. The issue is that the Wizards can offer him a contract worth five years and $245 million. I find it hard to believe that Bill would turn that down. A team to keep your eye on is the Toronto Raptors, according to Jake Fisher from Bleacher Report.

All of the players are in their prime. I think what's interesting about this is that, you know, you have magic and Curry, very different players. You have Kevin Durant and LeBron, very different players. But then you have MJ and Kobe. Very similar players. I'm not saying that these two end up washing each other out, because I do think that Michael Jordan was a significantly better player than Kobe, but because their play styles are so similar. I don't think it gives a big advantage to either team, but I think the advantages of these teams are relatively clear. Defensively, the bottom team is gonna be a lot better, especially with their switch ability, and the spacing of the top team is going to be considerably better than the bottoms. The problem with that, however, is that this isn't 5 on 5. This is 3 on 3, and spacing is not quite as important because there just aren't as many players on the court. Of course, the lack of spacing that MJ and magic have isn't even that big of a problem because both of them can shoot mid rangers and that'll give Kevin Durant plenty of space to work. However, the defensive problems for the top team are gonna be pretty hard to overcome. Tim Curry isn't a bad defender, but against magic he's a half foot shorter and if he gets switched on to MJ or Kevin Durant, it's game Over.

I've seen the value of a triple double argued over every single day. I've seen James Harden lead the league in free throw attempts in six consecutive seasons. I will foul baiting in ways that would get him tried in international court today. I have seen Giannis run and dunk his way to MVP's. I have seen men that move technological and statistical mountains to create advanced stats that make Yoka look like the best player of all time and the worst defensive player of all time at the same time. I've seen people track and beads games played schedule like he's on the CIA's most wanted list. And then I saw the NBA make a 65 game limit so he never wins that award again. And with SGA, he's the best player on the best team. He plays every game. He plays defense. He's extremely skilled. He gets fouled a very proportional amount to how much he drives to the basket. It's the best MVP case since 2016, Steph, and no one likes it because NBA fans don't like basketball.

Here's everything that happened today in the Western Conference, starting off with the Lakers and this trio. How about these quotes from Anthony Davis? Davis said that his goal is to play in all 82 games this upcoming season. I'm rooting for him. Davis also had this to say about the Denver Nuggets. Davis said that he and LeBron have had conversations about the Nuggets and they can't wait to play them. Don't forget, opening night is October 24th between the Lakers and the Nuggets. Meanwhile, in Denver, Nikola Jokic is back in the United States after a long off season with his horses in Serbia. And he and Jamal Murray had the same message, why not go out there and win another one? It was our first look at Phoenix's new Big Three. And Bradley Beal claimed that this is the best group that he's ever been a part of. Kevin Durant also sounded very eager about the Sun's upcoming season and also confirmed that he will be playing in the 2024.

Let's take a look at the Western Conference and see what moves were made in Day 1. The sun's were busy today and it wasn't just because of Kevin Durant. Devon Booker signed a super max extension to stay in Phoenix, four years and 224 million. According to Brian Windhorst, the Lakers are focused on a trade for Kyrie Irving. But that wasn't their only move of the day. The Lakers made four signings in total today. Lonnie Walker, Juan Tuscano, Anderson, Troy Brown Jr. And Damian Jones. And they had a clear emphasis, get younger. The Lakers also lost an important piece from last year's team with Malik Monk signing a two year, 19 million dollar deal to the Sacramento Kings. I like this move for Sacramento staying in the Bay Area. The warriors really wanted to keep Gary Payton the second, but he's headed to Portland on a three year contract. That wasn't the only move.

There is not a single way to argue that Kobe Bryant was a better basketball player than LeBron James. Matt Barnes recently came out and said that strictly when it comes to basketball, Kobe Bryant's better than LeBron. But what's kind of funny is that when it strictly comes to basketball, there's literally no way to argue that Kobe's better than LeBron. Oh, Kobe's a better scorer. Then why does LeBron average more points per game on better efficiency? Oh, well, Kobe was a better score on his prime. Young LeBron average the same amount of points per game on better efficiency than prime Kobe. Oh, well, Kobe's more clutch. Well, LeBron is the most efficient and the most clutch player, performer of his generation, whereas Kobe, he's the least efficient. And LeBron has 5 playoff buzzer beaters, the most all time, 2 more than any other player ever, whereas Kobe, he only has one. Kobe was a better 3 point shooter than LeBron. Well, LeBron has a better 3 point percentage than Kobe. He takes more attempts per game. His best 3 point shooting season is better than Kobe's. And when they were both in the league, LeBron was a better 3 point shooter. Oh, Kobe always showed up. He never missed games like LeBron. Well, during their 13 year primes, LeBron averaged 94 games a year, whereas Kobe, he only averaged 89. Oh, Kobe never quit on his team. He never Ran from the grind.

Seventeen of the last 18 MVP winners were coming off a season in which they LED their team in scoring. So if you were second or worse, you're gone. Next, 18 of the last 19 winners were voted to either first or second team All NBA the season before their win. Out of nowhere, MVP winners simply don't happen in the NBA. if you weren't one of the 10 best regular season players last season, you're also gone. Well, MVP is obviously a regular season award. 19 straight winners have both made the playoffs and average 23 points per game in that post season. So if you didn't clear that bar last year, you're getting cut. Fourth, we're looking at advanced stats because 18 of the last 19 MVP's total at least 9.8 win shares and average at least point two win shares per 48 minutes the season before their win. The only exception.

So what a lot of help defenders do, right, they see this player attack and change pace. And they allow that change of pace to make the decision for them. And then they go back to the defender that they're defending. Change of pace. Cooper sits on it. And now he just waits for Boozer to make his decision so he can make his decision, which leads to him getting right here.

Okay, so the first one is 2007 against the Spurs. They got swept. They didn't play good. And LeBron also didn't play good. He only averaged 22, 7 and 7. He shot under 36%. He wasn't great. But with all that being said, he was 22 at the time and he took this roster to the NBA Finals. What other 22 year old is taking this roster to the NBA Finals? And that's first team that swept him. They had the best defense in the league. They had the best SRS in the league. They had the best net rating in the league. We're the best team in the league. So yeah, when he was 22 years old, he lost to a dynasty that already had three rings. They had three hall of Famers and all defensive team player. I mean, they're an elite team. The only finals you can hold against LeBron is the 2011 Finals. He was terrible. He choked. He was passive. He didn't do his job. But 2014 against the Spurs wasn't his fault at all. Ron averaged 28 and 8 on 57% shooting 52% from three. He was elite. The problem was that a supporting cast of guys like Dwayne Wade, Ray Allen, Mario Chalmers, they shot under 40% and Wade was terrible. He averaged 15 points on 44% shooting like that's not him. And also they played an Elite Spurs team, 62 wins, the best SRS in the league, the best net rating, four hall of Famers. This was one of the best teams ever. And also the Spurs just played really well. I mean, they had the highest skill goal percentage for any team in the.

We already did this for most improves. Now let's use similar historical standards to determine DPO Y, starting with the 30 players with the best odds according to Draft Kings. The first and most obvious cut is that 26 of the last 27 Dpos were 6 foot 6 or taller. So sorry short kings, Marcus Smart ruined it for all of you. Additionally, each of the last 15 defensive players of the year were in their 20s, so if you've lived to see 30, recent history says you're too old. Next is a little bit more nebulous, but 12 of the last 15 DPOI winners were on top seven defenses the year before they won the award. So if you weren't on an elite defense last season, chances are you're not gonna win DPOI this season. Our last major cut is crucial, as eight of the last 10 DPOI winners finish in the top 10 in Defensive Player of the year voting the year before they won the award. Defense is so reputational in the NBA that it can take years for recognition to catch up with actual defensive impact.

Their slogan is unbound to, it means unity for the greater good. I just want these slogans to be in English. I don't want any other language. This might be a hot take, but I do not like the math slogan. It's hashtag mffl. Slogans should not be hashtags. By the way, that means Madison fan for life. It's just not good.

Every man has done that at least once. You're gonna wanna do is lay on your back with both feet out and then you wanna put one leg up. Now instead of tucking it in between your legs and making it fully disappear, you're gonna wanna tuck it behind your leg that is already up. Every man can also move their thing manually up and down. If you can't do this, go to the doctor. But while it's sitting on the back of your leg, you're gonna wanna move it up and down. That's gonna create that friction which is gonna create pleasure and you just unlocked a new way of gooning. If you have a curve like me, it perfectly hooks around the back of your leg, which creates the ultimate pleasure. You can even fuck around and rub lotion all on the back of your leg before you do it so it could feel as real as possible. This is lowkey cheating the system too. If you're on no fat, this doesn't count as fapping. You can trick yourself. The only downside to doing this is when you have to finish, you don't really know where the residue is Gonna go you can fuck around and accidentally finish inside of your own behind.

If you don't know what the extra sleep method is, you're not a real one. The extra sleep method is when you set an alarm early as hell, hours prior to when you have to actually get up. For example, if I have to wake up at 7:00am, I'll set my alarm to 4:00am, wake up, turn the alarm off and go back to sleep. It feels like crack doing this. I swear to god. I don't know what it is, but it's just something about being thankful for your sleep. You're already gonna get that first wave of tiredness when you first wake up, so why not get it out the way a few hours before and then go back to sleep and then it feels like it's extra sleep. It also subconsciously helps you get up at your actual time because when you wake up, you're going back to bed with the mindset, okay, I have to get up in a few hours. But this method is patched because our attention span is too short. So when we wake up, we're gonna get on our phone and doom scroll or we're too tired cause we're too old and we're gonna sleep through the alarms. I don't know, I just prefer taking two really long naps instead of one full eight to 10 hour of sleep. Everybody has their own.

The thing about this damn dunk that was so wild is not the fact that he's 6 2 taking off from one leg, is the distance and the fact that it was in somewhat traffic. Literally somebody blew by him before he took off. Like what in the LeBron James is going on here? I know he's 6 2. He looks like he's 6 5 right here. Bronnie pulled that off in the Lakers first summer league game and he didn't have a crazy game, but he did have 10 points in 11 minutes. You can add two boards, one still, we shot 3 for 7 from the field and 2 for 5 from the 3 point line. Again, it was only in 11 minutes. He's already somewhat solidified for the Lakers. They don't wanna see him play in the summer league. They wanna see these other guys hoop as well. But I must say I'm extremely impressed with his mindset going into this season. I'm most likely not gonna be the guy right now to get myself on the floor. I have to be a defensive menace. No lies there. One way to get yourself on the floor is being able to play deep.

Just yesterday in Kansas City, huge vote on a possible sales tax, which would then raise money for a brand new Royal Stadium and renovations to the Chief Stadium. But you gotta take a look at some of these proposed renovations and upgrades that would be using public money for the Chief Stadium. New parking orientation, new parking deck, VIP access road, VIP entry, VIP entry in canopy, new enzone suites. These renovations were expected to cost about 800 million and the team owner Clark Hunt and his family only wanted to pay 300 million. So Clark Hunt, I ask you, why should the average person be paying so that you can reorient your parking deck, build some VIP suites and a VIP entry? Sort of the resounding feeling online from Royals and Chiefs fans is this whole plan was like half baked with very little communication from these guys. And I don't wanna say that two examples makes a trend, but something sort of similar happened in DC and Northern Virginia just recently. This is Ted Leons.

It was by far the hardest. At first, I thought this was crazy, but the more I looked into it, the more it made sense. People have felt that the Lakers won a fake Mickey Mouse ring, but the truth is it was one of the most mentally and emotionally demanding championships in NBA history. LeBron himself called the experience a mental warfare as teams had to spend 93 days straight inside their hotel rooms with no breaks and barely any family. There were no home court advantages, no travel days and no fans to feed off of. Dwight Howard went so far as to say the bubble finals were tougher than his showdown against Kobe's Lakers in 2009. But the moment that made it clear just how different the games were in the bubble was during the Nuggets Clippers series. I was in the bubble with Richard Jefferson who told me that this environment felt like an open gym. The environment made it easier for players to do well and guys who never had good games were suddenly dropping 30 against anybody. But that's exactly the point. When everyone's hooping at their peak, winning gets way.

Let's see if he has a point. The town pool in LeBron's era isn't just 330 million Americans, 7.8 billion people across the world with over 25% of players born outside the U. S. Up from just 7% in Jordan's time. And these aren't just role players, they're m V p's from every corner of the world. Giannis from Greece, Jokic from Serbia, Ibede from Cameroon, Luka from Slovenia. Jordan didn't face modern defenses. For example, zone defense was illegal. Teams had to play strict man to man and defenders couldn't just leave their assignment to help. If they drifted too far or hung around the paint without actively guarding someone, it was called illegal defense and the penalty was a technical foul. That meant help. Defense was limited, rotations were slower and double teams were usually reserved for post touches. There were no traps at half court, no switching everything, no chaos. Even Jordan admitted that if zone defenses had been legal in his era, his career would have been very different. The 90s had rules. Big stayed in the paint, guards didn't switch, shoot.

Kyrie now has to be the primary ball handler and decision maker on the team that wants to win a championship. As much as I love Kyrie, as talented as he is, that's not his main strength.

He also says, if I say it's okay to call these guys great, maybe my fans will listen. Maybe then they'll stop tearing the game down. So in other words, he's saying, y'all see greatness, but because y'all are holding on to his legacy so much, you don't even want to appreciate it.

Three days ago an 11 year old baseball fan in Los Angeles, California pulled the card of a lifetime, a tops one of one Paul skins rookie autograph game used Jersey card. The card which many of predicted could already be worth $1 million has gone viral. And now this kid is getting offers from everywhere, including from Paul Skins, his team, the Pittsburgh Pirates and his girlfriend Livi Dunn. Listen what the Pirates just offered this kid. They offered him a pair of Pirates season ticket holders for the next 30 years, a softball game at PNC Park with coaching from Pirates alumni, a spring training experience and much more. And if that's not enough skeins, his girlfriend influencer Livi Dunn added to the bribe by offering this kid to hang with her in her private suite. But guess what, this kid's got more integrity than most 11 year olds because he turned down not only the Pirates offer but Livvy Dunn's offer as well. Instead, the kid has decided to team up with fanatics and take the card to auction. Now in my opinion.

So let's talk about them. First off, you have the people who try to make the character look like themselves. And I respect that. Like I feel like that's what you should do. Uh, but it never works. It never works that well. Even the face scans doesn't work. You just don't, it'll resemble them, but it doesn't look like them. The second one is people who always try to make their character as good looking as possible. This one's really sad, especially when like they don't look like their character. Cause I always take it as them saying like, this is how I wish I looked. The third one is making your character look crazy or ugly or whatever. A lot of people do this. They'll wear weird outfits. They'll do the crazy tattoos. They'll have brightly colored hair. They'll make the face all messed up. I feel like that's easier than trying to make the character look good or look like yourself. And then the fourth one are people who try to make their character look like another NBA player. There aren't a ton of people like this, but every once in a while you'll go up against somebody and be like that.

Literally. He was struggling on the bench surviving off bananas, like playing his heart out. You know what the Mavericks did for him? The Mavericks got him his own personal chef to tend to him at all times during this process. Do you know how much love that is for a player? And then guess what Kyrie said about the Mavs organization? Kyrie Irving feels embraced by the Dallas community. I have been accepted way beyond just my talent on the court. Do you know what that means to a star player? A lot of these players feel like commodities, just items. They don't even feel like people. When an organization truly cares about a player, they will play 10 times harder for the organization. But if you out there feeding your players bananas when you know they not eating, they not gonna really mess with you. And as we see, Kyrie does not mess with the Nets and neither do I cause that's wild.

The thing about this damn dunk that was so wild is not the fact that he's 6 2 taking off from one leg, is the distance and the fact that it was in somewhat traffic. Literally somebody blew by him before he took off. Like what in the LeBron James is going on here? I know he's 6 2. He looks like he's 6 5 right here. Bronny pulled that off in the Lakers first summer league game. And he didn't have a crazy game, but he did have 10 points in 11 minutes. You can add two boards. One. Still, we shot 3 for 7 from the field and 2 for 5 from the 3 point line. Again, it was only in 11 minutes. He's already somewhat solidified for the Lakers. They don't wanna see him play in the summer league, they wanna see these other guys hoop as well. But I must say I'm extremely impressed with his mindset going into this season. I'm most likely not gonna be the guy right now. To get myself on the floor, I have to be a defensive menace. No lies there. One way to get yourself on the floor is being able to play defense.

A lot of people requested me to talk about this. So let me give you all my opinion. So the advantage that Team a has that all their players have won an MVP, they have no weak link. Where's with Team B? Even though they do have the best two players in this game and of all time, they have Kyrie Irving who never even came close to being as good as any of these other guys. Let's say you took out Kyrie and Kyrie and just made it to 2 on 2. Team B would win. No question, 100% of people would agree with me on that. So what it comes down to is this Kyrie versus Kyrie matchup. Kyrie is the significantly better player. And if Kyrie gets outplayed, even though they have the two best players on their team, Team B would still lose. But here's the problem with that. We don't need to speculate. Prime Curry was in 2016. Prime Kyrie was in 2016. We don't need to speculate how Curry and Kyrie would hold up against each other because both of their primes were in 2016 and they played a full series against each other. In the series that they played against each other, Kyrie put up 27, 4 and 4. Curry put up 23, 5 and 4. Obviously, Prime Kyrie isn't better than Prime Curry, but he did hold his own against him. And that's All he needs to do, if he's got LeBron and MJ.

And I just ripped it off. There was chunks of my skin that had fallen off with the tape. Yes, I did tell her to pull it off because at this point of time, she had had the adhesive on for a long, long time. I told her that this tape that I use, something that I normally don't use.

I put my feet in the lock pedals and about halfway through the class, she took it to another level. One of the things she had instructed to me, because it was my first class, was that I needed to always keep my eyes on her, stay focused on her, do what I do. We stood up. I lose sight of her. Now, when I stand up, my right foot comes loose from the pedal. And that's when I had turned to look at her. But if you'll notice, the left foot doesn't stop. It keeps rotating. So I couldn't get my foot out. My other foot twisted at an extreme level. I literally felt ligaments tear in my knee. I had torn an ACL and an MCL. That is not my fault. It is not my job to babysit.

My 58 year old mom had to get knee replacement surgery last month and she was terrified about going under anesthesia. She kept asking the doctors if she'd say anything embarrassing while waking up. Don't worry, Mrs. Johnson, most people just ask for water or their family famous last words. Sitting in the recovery room when they wheel my mom in, still completely out of it, the nurse says she should wake up in about 10 minutes. Mom's eyes flutter open. She looks around the room, sees me and her face gets this expression of pure panic. Oh, no. Oh, no. Did I fart during surgery? Mom, you were unconscious. It doesn't matter. But what if I did? What if the doctors think I'm gross? The nurse is trying not to laugh. Missus Johnson, that's completely normal during surgery. Normal? You mean everyone farts when they're unconscious? Mom looks horrified. So the doctor saw my underwear and I might have farted. This is the worst day of my life. Then she gets this suspicion. Just look and stares at me intensely. Wait, how do I know you're really my son and not some random person? Mom, it's me, Michael, prove it. What's my most embarrassing secret? I'm trying to think when she interrupts. Wrong, you're taking too long. My real son would know immediately. The nurse is openly giggling. Now, Mrs. Johnson Maybe we should know. This person might be a spy. They could be here to steal my identity. Mom, why would anyone want to steal the identity of someone who just had knee surgery? Because I'm valuable. I have a Costco membership. She tries to sit up and points at me dramatically. I bet you don't even know my Maiden name. It's Rodriguez. Lucky guess.

In a Reddit post, the man explained the situation, that he and his wife were flying to visit his 21 year old daughter who was away at college. The husband said he's very Type A and hates to be late, but his wife, who is his daughter's stepmother, has a very different go with the flow type of attitude. The couple managed to make their first flight on this particular journey, but the connecting flight was another story. They got to their terminal and had about 15 minutes before the next leg of their journey, but the wife insisted she wanted coffee and the husband offered to get it from the market right next to their gate. He insisted, however, on going to Starbucks, which was nowhere near their gate. He told her they did not have enough time, but she went anyway without him. As the plane was boarding, this husband called his wife four times to ask where she was. She finally answered on the fourth call and said that she was on her way back to the terminal and that the line at Starbucks was exceptionally long. The husband went ahead and boarded the plane after the gate agent said they couldn't hold up the flight. He full on left his wife behind.

So my little brother Jake is 15 and I'm 17 and I've been driving him to school for the past six months since I got my license. At first, it was actually kind of cool having the extra time to hang out with him in the car. But then around three weeks ago, something changed. I don't know if it's because he started playing more video games late at night or what, but Jake just stopped caring about basic hygiene, like completely stopped talking about not showering for days, wearing the same clothes over and over, and this musty smell that would just fill up my entire car the second he got in. The first time I really noticed it was on a Monday morning. I open the passenger door for him and this wave of stench just hit me like a brick wall. It was like a mix of old sweat, dirty laundry and something else I couldn't even identify. I actually had to step back and take a breath of fresh air before getting in my own car. I tried to be subtle about it at first. I'd roll down all the windows even when it was freezing outside. And I started keeping those little air fresheners in my car, but it didn't help. The smell would just stick to the fabric seats and linger. There for hours after I dropped him off. By the second week, I was starting to feel nauseous during our drives, like actually sick to my stomach. I'd have to breathe through my mouth the entire time. And even then I could still taste this gross smell in the air. My friends started commenting on how my car smelled weird, which was embarrassing. I finally decided to talk to Jake about it directly. I waited until we were almost at school one morning and said something like, hey, you might want to shower more often, dude. But he just shrugged and said he had showered recently, which was obviously a lie because his hair was so greasy it looked wet. Things got worse when my girlfriend Emma asked if she could get a ride to school with us one day. I couldn't say no without explaining why, so I just hoped Jake would have cleaned himself up. But nope. Emma got in the backseat and within like 30 seconds, she was trying not to gag. She kept shooting me these looks like, what is that smell? And I was so mortified. After that, Emma started making excuses not to ride with us. And I knew she was telling her friends about it because they'd give me weird looks when I walked by. It was humiliating. The breaking point came last Thursday. I picked Jake up and the smell was so bad that I actually had to pull over after like Two blocks because I thought I was going to throw up. I'm not exaggerating. I literally had my head out the window, dry heaving on the side of the road. Some lady jogging by asked if I was okay. That afternoon, I went straight to my parents. I found them in the kitchen and just laid it all out. I told them I wasn't driving Jake to school anymore unless he started showering regularly and washing his clothes. My mom immediately got defensive and said I was being dramatic. But my dad asked what exactly was going on. I explained everything, how the smell was making me physically sick, how it was affecting my friend.

I was representing this kid named Marcus in a personal injury case. He was 19, worked at a warehouse and got hurt when a forklift driver wasn't paying attention. Crushed his leg pretty bad. Needed three surgeries, couldn't work for eight months. The company hired this hot shot lawyer from downtown. Designer suits, fancy briefcase, the whole deal. His name was Richard Blackwell, and he had this reputation for destroying plaintiffs in court. Made people look like liars and fraudsters. My client was nervous as hell. Marcus came from a poor family, never finished high school, and talked with this thick accent that made him sound uneducated. I coached him for weeks on how to answer questions simply and clearly. The day of the deposition, Blackwell showed up with two assistants and a stack of papers three inches thick. He started questioning Marcus like he was interrogating a serial killer. Mister Garcia, isn't it true you were drinking the night before this alleged accident? Marcus said no. He doesn't drink alcohol because his dad was an alcoholic. But you do use marijuana recreationally, correct? Again, Marcus said no. He'd never touched drugs in his life because he'd seen what they did to his neighborhood. This went on for two hours. Blackwell kept trying to make Marcus look like some kind of druggie or troublemaker. Asked about his tattoos, his friends, even his girlfriend's job at a strip club. But Marcus stayed calm and honest. Just kept saying, no, sir, that's not true, sir. I would never do that, sir. It had more class than the lawyer questioning him. Then Blackwell made his big move. He pulled out these photographs and slammed them on the table, like he'd caught Marcus in some huge lie. These photos were taken the week weekend after your accident, Mister Garcia. You're clearly shown dancing at a nightclub, jumping around using your supposedly injured leg without any problems whatsoever. Marcus looked at the photos for a long time. I was panicking inside because this could destroy our entire case. If he was out partying right after getting hurt, the jury would think he was faking. But

I know this only man I'll miss with it. At the time, Miss Chapel, you were obviously having sex with at least one other person during the window. At least we do know that. And he's not the father. Yes. Thank you. A lot of life. Yes. Thank you. Okay. Mr Pal, you came in suing the defendant for $2,475 in lost wages because you said he would not babysit for the child and you lost your job. And now, since we've determined that in fact, while Lacy is not his biological child, he doesn't even have a moral obligation. Right, or legal obligation. Yes. You are. To babysit for this child. For that reason, your claim is denied. Yes. You are judgment for the defendant.

So I'm at this upscale steakhouse called Morton's last Friday night with my girlfriend Julia for our two year anniversary. We've been planning this dinner for weeks, and I'd saved up to make it special. We get seated at this nice corner booth with candles and everything. The atmosphere was perfect until our waiter, Kevin, showed up. This guy was maybe mid twenties, tall, one of those overly confident types who thinks he's God's gift to women. The second he sees Julia, his whole demeanor changes. Good evening, beautiful, he says to her while completely ignoring me, not even a glance in my direction. I'm Kevin, and I'll be taking excellent care of you tonight. Julia looks uncomfortable immediately, but tries to be polite. Kevin asks what she'd like to drink, maintains eye contact the whole time, even compliments her dress. That color really brings out your eyes. As when it's my turn to order, he finally looks at me like I'm some annoying interruption. And you? He asks with zero enthusiasm. I order a beer, and he actually rolls his eyes before walking away. Twenty minutes later, he brings our drinks, places Julia's Wine Down like he's serving royalty, and basically slides my beer across the table without looking at me, spill, pull some on my sleeve, and doesn't even apologize. We order our entrees, and the same thing happens. He's asking Julia detailed questions about how she wants Her salmon prepared, making suggestions, being overly attentive. For my steak order, he just nods and write something down without asking anything. Food comes out, and Kevin places Julia's plate down, gently arranging her sides perfectly. Then he literally drops my plate in front of me so hard the steak bounces. Asks her how everything looks, completely ignores me. Throughout the entire meal, Kevin keeps finding excuses to come back to our table. Refills Julia's wine three times without being asked, compliments her jewelry, asks about her job. My water glass sits empty the whole time. Julia keeps trying to redirect the conversation to include me, but Kevin acts like I don't exist. He's getting visibly uncomfortable, but doesn't want to cause a scene on our anniversary. Then comes dessert time. Kevin brings over the menu and goes, A beautiful woman like you simply must try our signature chocolate souffle. It's as sweet as you are. That's when he does it. Slides a folded napkin next to Julia's wine glass with his number written on it right in front of me. I've had enough. I stand up and say loud enough for the surrounding ables to hear, excuse me, but this is my girlfriend, and we're here celebrating our anniversary. Kevin doesn't even flinch, just looks at me with this smirk and goes, she's old enough to make her own choices, man. Maybe she wants to talk to someone more mature. The entire section goes quiet. Other diners are turning To stare. Julia's face is bright red from embarrassment. You seriously hitting on my girlfriend right in front of me after ignoring me all night? I ask, my voice getting louder. Kevin shrugs like it's no big deal. Hey, I'm just being friendly. Not my fault she's out of your league. That's when the manager appears. This well dressed older guy in a suit who'd clearly been watching from across the room. Is there a problem here, gentlemen? I explain everything that happened.

I'm 22, Alex is 23, and we've been roommates for a year. I've always been cool with gay people. Had a gay friend in high school, never bothered me. Alex and I became close friends pretty quickly. We'd watch movies together, cook dinner, joke around constantly. He's honestly one of the funniest people I know, and we have this weird chemistry where we can talk for hours about absolutely nothing. But recently, when Alex brings guys over, I get this weird angry feeling in my chest that I can't explain. It started about three months ago when I came home early from work and saw him making out with some tall athletic guy on our couch. They were really going at it and I felt like someone had punched me in the stomach. I wanted to punch something, which made absolutely no sense. I mumbled an awkward apology and locked myself in my room for the rest of the night, blasting music to drown out any sounds. Since then, every single time he has a date over, I become this bitter cold version of myself that I don't even recognize. I'll give his dates dirty looks when they walk in, make sarcastic comments under my breath or just appeared to my room, and blast music until they leave. One guy tried to politely Introduce himself in our kitchen, and I literally just walked past him like he didn't exist. Another time, I came home and saw Alex cuddling with someone while watching Netflix, and I made such a loud, dramatic entrance that they both jumped apart. Alex started noticing my attitude, and it was seriously affecting our friendship. We went from hanging out every single night, cooking together, and having our stupid inside jokes to barely speaking to each other. The apartment felt tense and uncomfortable all the time. Last week, he finally confronted me in our kitchen while I was aggressively washing dishes after another one of his dates had just left. Dude, seriously, what's your problem? You've been a complete jerk to every guy I bring over. I couldn't look at him. Just kept scrubbing the same plate over and over. I don't have a problem. That's bullshit and you know it. You're acting like I'm doing something wrong by dating people. I finally turned around, feeling frustrated and cornered. I'm not homophobic, if that's what you're thinking. His face softened a little. I never said you were homophobic. But something's clearly bothering you, and it's making things weird between us. I couldn't explain the rage I felt seeing him with other people. This sick, jealous feeling that made no sense. So I just said I was stressed about work and walked away from the conversation. Then my mom came to visit for the weekend. She met Alex and instantly loved Him. They spent hours talking while I was at work, bonding over cooking shows and sharing embarrassing stories about me. That Sunday night, after some of his friends stopped by to hang out, she pulled me aside in my room with this knowing look on her face. Honey, that boy is absolutely head over heels for you. I laughed nervously. Mom, he's gay and I'm straight. We're just roommates and friends. She gave me that look mothers have when they know something you don't. Trust me, I know what pining looks like. I've been watching people fall in love for 50 years. The way he talks about you, remembers every little thing you like, lights up when you walk in the room. You're not just his roommate to him. Sweetie. That's ridiculous, mom. And you, she continued, crossing her arms, are acting exactly like a jealous boyfriend. All that anger when he brings dates home. That's not homophobic

The night Marcus told us about drinking his ex's breast milk, we were all drunk at his apartment and playing never have I ever, someone said, never have I ever hooked up with a pregnant woman. And Marcus took the longest drink of his life. We were dying to know the story. And after some peer pressure, he finally spilled. Okay, so remember Jessica? We kept screwing while she was pregnant and after she gave birth. We're already scandalized. But then he dropped the real bomb. One time she was breastfeeding and I got curious, so I tried some. The entire room exploded into chaos. People screaming and laughing and throwing beer cans at him while he ducked behind the couch yelling. It was actually good, though. That was two years before we started dating and I'd actually forgotten about it until one night early into our relationship when he was kissing my chest and I jokingly brought up his infamous confession. Remember when you told everyone about Jessica's milk? I teased. Instead, he pulled me closer and said, honestly, I do think about the nursing thing sometimes, but mostly I'm just obsessed with your chest. We both laughed and I started playing into it during intimate moments, pretending to nurse him while he whispered sweet nothings. Sometimes I tease him about having an actual lactation fetish and he wrestled me into taking it back and we lived. In this perfect little bubble where nothing else mattered. But our perfect bubble burst when antibiotics messed with my birth control and the pregnancy test showed positive at 14 weeks. First thought was abortion. And Marcus held me while I cried, promising to drive me to the clinic himself. But that night over wine, he made a joke about whether I was lactating yet. When I stared at him in shock, he backtracked quickly. I'm kidding, babe. Unless, I mean you getting the abortion anyway, right? What if we waited just a little bit? His eyes had this hunger I've never seen before as he explained how I could start producing around 20 weeks, how we could experience it just once before terminating. I was drunk and scared while he stroked my hair, reminding me that after 20 weeks, I couldn't get the procedure anyway. Just four weeks, baby. One month to try this thing we've been pretending. Then back to normal. The way he said it sounded so simple when I was already panicking about being 14 weeks along without knowing. 18 weeks came fast and my breasts stayed dry while my belly grew rounder. Marcus would massage them nightly with desperate hope like he could magically make milk appear. I made my abortion appointment for 19 weeks to be safe. But when I woke up that morning, my car keys were missing. I'll help you look, Marcus said, tearing apart couch cushions with fake concerned. Maybe we can Go tomorrow instead. When I found them in his jacket pocket, it was already too late and I'd missed the appointment. He laughed it off as stress making him forgetful. While the clinic called to confirm and he answered my phone telling them I changed my mind. Just a few more days, he begged when I confronted him. You're so close, I can feel it. I rescheduled for the last possible day, telling myself I was being paranoid when I noticed my morning tea tasted different. But then I started waking up groggy. At noon, my alarm clock mysteriously unplugged. Marcus already gone to work with my car keys in his pocket. Morning of 19 weeks and five days, I woke to a strange tugging sensation and found Marcus hunched over me in the darkness. His mouth latched onto my chest while his hands needed desperately at the flesh. His eyes were closed in concentration and he was making these small whimpering sounds like a starving animal. When I gasped, his eyes flew open, but he didn't stop, just stared at me while he sucked harder, his fingernails digging crescents into my skin.

So my little brother Jake is 15 and I'm 17 and I've been driving him to school for the past six months since I got my license. First, it was actually kind of cool having the extra time to hang out with him in the car. But then around three weeks ago, something changed. I don't know if it's because he started playing more video games late at night or what, but Jake just stopped caring about basic hygiene, like completely stopped talking about not showering for days, wearing the same clothes over and over, and this musty smell that would just fill up my entire car the second he got in. The first time I really noticed it was on a Monday morning. I opened the passenger door for him and this wave of stench just hit me like a brick wall. It was like a mix of old sweat, dirty laundry and something else I couldn't even identify. I actually had to step back and take a breath of fresh air before getting in my own car. I tried to be subtle about it at first. I'd roll down all the windows even when it was freezing outside. And I started keeping those little air fresheners in my car, but it didn't help. The smell would just stick to the fabric seats and linger there. For hours after I dropped him off. By the second week, I was starting to feel nauseous during our drives, like actually sick to my stomach. I'd have to breathe through my mouth the entire time. And even then I could still taste this gross smell in the air. My friends started commenting on how my car smelled weird, which was embarrassing. I finally decided to talk to Jake about it directly. I waited until we were almost at school one morning and said something like, hey, you might wanna shower more often, dude. But he just shrugged and said he had showered recently, which was obviously a lie because his hair was so greasy it looked wet. Things got worse when my girlfriend Emma asked if she could get a ride to school with us one day. I couldn't say no without explaining why, so I just hoped Jake would have cleaned himself up. But nope. Emma got in the backseat and within like 30 seconds, she was trying not to gag. He kept shooting me these looks like, what is that smell? And I was so mortified. After that, Emma started making excuses not to ride with us. And I knew she was telling her friends about it because they'd give me weird looks when I walked by, was humiliating. The breaking point came last Thursday. I picked Jake up and the smell was so bad that I actually had to pull over after like two blocks because I thought I was going to throw up. I'm not exaggerating. I literally had my head out the window, dry heaving on the side of the road. Some lady jogging by asked if I was okay. That afternoon, I went straight to my parents. I found them in the kitchen and just laid it all out. I told them I wasn't driving Jake to school anymore unless he started showering regularly and washing his clothes. My mom immediately got defensive and said I was being dramatic. But my dad asked what exactly was going on. I explained everything, how the smell was making me physically sick, how it was affecting my friend.

So he gets a taxi as quickly as possible to a nearby repair shop where they charge him 12 dollars to fix his guitar. he called the airline the next day to ask them to pay for the repairs, but they refuse, telling him that it's too, too late now because he should have filed a complaint the day it happened, which he tried to do. So that's when he decided it was time to get revenge. He got a few of his friends together to write a song dissing United Airlines, thinking it would just be a funny joke. But although the airline wasn't concerned about the song at first, it suddenly started to get attention. So they freaked out, then told him they would pay the 12 if he took the song down. But he refused saying it was too late because they should have contacted him the day he posted it. That song ended up getting 19 million views which cost United Airlines over 10 million.

I was walking down the street when these two girls I've never seen before called my name. Ryan. This is super weird, but our best friend's baby shower is happening right now. Can you please pretend to be her boyfriend and the father? I did a double take. They looked so desperate. Ex is insane. He tried to burn their house down while she was in. He's gonna show up at some point and we need someone who can scare him off. I'm 6 feet 4 inches and apparently look like I eat nails for breakfast. So I get why they picked me, but this was insane. How do you even know my name? Your gym bag, one said, pointing at the tag. Please, he said he's coming at three PM to reclaim what's his. It's 2:15. Against every logical thought, I followed them into this house covered in pink balloons and baby girl banners. The living room was packed with women who all turned to stare at me. Then I saw her, Becky from my comparative lit class sophomore year, the girl I'd spent an entire semester trying to work up the courage to talk to. Now eight months pregnant, looking exhausted, it seemed like the worst joke the universe has ever played. Everyone, this is Ryan. The girls announced the father. Becky's eyes went wide recognizing me, but she played along. Hey, babe, she said weakly. Her friend Pulled me aside. Richard's been sending videos all morning. He's unhinged. Just stand there and look protective until he shows up and leaves. I stood by Becky's chair while she opened presents. The party tried to feel normal, but everyone was tense. Her phone buzzed. She showed me a video from Richard on my way to get what's mine. Hope you didn't think you could replace me. This is the sixth one today, Becky whispered. An older woman, maybe an aunt, said quietly to another guest, remember when Richard threw that bottle at her head at Christmas? Becky's mom approached me. Thank you for doing this. Last time he showed up somewhere, he broke her friend's nose for interfering. Another video came through at 2:30. Richard in his truck. Tell everyone to clear out unless they want problems. The room got quieter. People kept glancing at the windows. At 2:40, another text. Nice pink decorations. Almost there. A friend mentioned he knows which house he's probably driving by. Becky tried to focus on opening a baby onesie. Her hands were shaking. Last time he came to a party, someone whispered. Four people went to the er. At 2:50, Becky's phone rang. She put it on speak.

That's excessive. Hi, Jamie. Our contract states a 60 minute lunch break. Is there an issue? It's about efficiency. From now on, everyone gets 30 minutes, no exceptions. That seems rather abrupt. What about our agreed terms? Company policy overrides. We'll deduct pay for every minute over 30. I see. And this applies to everyone, correct? Absolutely. I'll be monitoring everyone's time personally. Understood. I'll be sure to comply meticulously. Good. I expect to see improved productivity immediately. Of course. Efficiency is key, after all. Alex, why is everyone standing motionless at their desks? We're complying with the new policy, Jamie. No one's taking more than 30 minutes. What are you talking about? Get back to work. We can't. According to labor laws, we're entitled to two 15 minute breaks. Since lunch is now 30 minutes, we're taking our breaks in 10 second increments throughout the day. This is absurd. You can't just stop working every few minutes. Actually, we must. It's about efficiency and strict policy adherence, remember? Fine. Go back to 60 minute lunches. Just work normally. I'm afraid we can't do that either. It would violate the policy you just created. We'll need official documentation to amend the policy in triplicate. Of course. This is a nightmare. How long will that take? Well, considering our new ultra efficient 10 second break schedule, about six weeks. Six weeks? That's insane. I agree. Perhaps we should discuss more Reasonable policies. Just. Just go take your lunch a full hour, please. Certainly. Jamie, would you like us to enjoy it, or should we eat efficiently? Follow for more.

Of course I am. You said you were going to sleep, which I guess we know was a lie. I was sleeping until you woke me up by texting me. And the snap score? I really have no clue.

You've never dressed up that nice when I take you out. Sounds like someone's a bit insecure. Do you not trust me? To be honest, not really. What? How dare you say that? You know, maybe it's time.

More important than your unborn child? The one I'm carrying in my body? Honestly? Maybe. What do you have against my mom? Where do I even fart? She barges and stays for hours and acts like I need to change every single thing in this house. She talks to me like I'm 50 and forgets I'm a 20 year old pregnant woman.

Maybe if you had hobbies or some actual friends you wouldn't feel so trapped when my mom's around. Oh, I'm sorry, should I just pick up an outdoor activity while being pregnant? Why don't you try talking to her for once? Tell her how you feel about her visits. Everything sounds 10 times worse than broken English, which is the language I have to speak to her in since she can't grasp anything. No thanks. Hunter, you need to choose. Me and your child or your overbearing 70 year old Mother, she can come once a month, max. That's so unfair. But fine, I pick you. We've got our whole future ahead. And I do love you. I just hope you can learn to respect my mom one day. Good. Now go tell her she's not coming over today. Contina app, bring me. Am I the a hole bot? Am I the bad guy for choosing to spend more time with my pregnant girlfriend than my mom? It makes sense to prioritize your future with your girlfriend. No, you are not the whole. As long as you make time for both. Mom, I'm heading to work, and, uh, Cami doesn't want you to come over today. Excuse me? She's got her reasons. She said you can still come over when I'm home, but not as often. I knew that Brat would pull something like this. I'm going over there right now to set her straight. Mom, no, please don't do this. Mom! It's been 15 minutes. Reply, please. I'm coming back right now. Hunter, your mom is tweaking out. She's banging on the door. It sounds like it's going to break. I'm hiding in the bathroom. Hold on, Babe. I'm almost there. Just three more minutes. I don't think I can, babe. I love you. Hunter! Mom, stop! Back away from the door now! I'm almost there. Hunter, I lost control.

It's not even a test. It's more like a polite guessing game. Multiple choice with 4 options and the answer basically highlighted for you. Nah, man, that's not an exam. That's a confidence booster. Y'all get questions where the hardest part is spelling your name. It's giving, we don't want to hurt your feelings, energy. And what kills me the most, Americans still complain. You'll hear them walking out like, uh, that was so hard. Hard where, bro, your exam had colorful fonts and fun facts in the margins. Mine had trauma. I came out of my paper needing therapy and a nap. You came out talking about lunch plans. Meanwhile, UK exams feel like they were designed by a villain. One question, 12 marks, and somehow it's about a topic we never even covered. You sit there staring like, this wasn't in the syllabus, bro. And the time? In the US, you get 90 minutes and two snack breaks in between for 10 questions. In the UK, it's basically prison. No water, no calculator, no hope. And if you cough too loudly, they incriminate you for cheating. American exams be like, use your notes, take your time. We believe in you. UK exams be like, figure it out or don't. We don't care. But hey, real talk. At the end of the day, exams are stressful everywhere. Doesn't matter if it's multiple choice or full essays. We're All in the same boat, tired, mentally drained, and one bad grade away from a full identity crisis. So if you're out here just trying to survive school. Same, bro. Same.

It started about 6 months ago. Every argument, every little thing that didn't go her way, slam. Every time I asked her to do dishes, slam. When I told her she couldn't go to some party where I knew they'd be drinking, slam. The sound would shake the whole upstairs. My coffee mug fell off my nightstand twice from the vibrations. My husband Dave kept telling me to ignore it. He'd say kids go through phases. She'll grow out of it. Easy for him to say since he's usually at work when most of the slamming happens. I'm the one working from home trying to take client calls while slam echoes through the house. The breaking point came on a Tuesday. Emma wanted to borrow my car to drive to her friend Jess's house. I said no because she got a speeding ticket the week before and we agreed her driving privileges were suspended. She started screaming about how unfair I was, how I never trust her, how all her friends think I'm psycho. Then she stomped upstairs and slam. But this time was different. This time I heard something crack. I went up to check and there was a split running down the door frame. The wood was actually damaged. That door had been slammed so hard and so many times that it was breaking the house. I stood there staring at that crack and something just Snapped in me. I marched to the garage, grabbed Dave's screwdriver set and went back upstairs. Emma was inside her room blasting music, probably expecting me to yell at her through the door like usual. Instead, I started unscrewing the hinges. It took me about 10 minutes. Emma didn't even notice until I was lifting the door off the frame. Then her music stopped. Real quick, mom, what are you doing? She called out. Solving a problem, I said. Carrying her door downstairs to the garage, she appeared at the top of the stairs in her pajamas, mouth hanging open. You can't take my door. I need privacy. You lost door privileges when you damaged the house. I told her privacy is earned, not guaranteed. The next few days were interesting. Emma tried everything. She hung a bed sheet across the doorway, which I took down. She moved her dresser to block the opening, so I moved it back. While she was at school, she even tried staying at her friend's house, but Jess's mom called me asking what was going on. By day 4, Emma was sitting on her bed when I got home from the grocery store. No music, no phone, just sitting there. This is embarrassing, she said. What if someone comes over? Then maybe you'll think twice before destroying property. I said, I wasn't destroying anything. I was just mad. The door frame says otherwise. That's when she actually looked at the crack she'd made. I Could see her face change when she realized she'd actually damaged something. Day 7 was when things got real. Emma's boyfriend, Tyler, came over to work on some school project. I watched from the kitchen as he walked upstairs, expecting to go into her room and.

My high school made all the boys holding their pee because someone wrote HI on the wall in Sharpie. Monday morning we all showed up to find a sign taped to the boys bathroom door. Closed until further notice due to vandalism. The girls bathroom was still open, of course, but our school only had one bathroom for boys in the entire building because it was an old school built in the 60s when they apparently thought teenage boys never needed to pee. Principal Carpenter made an announcement during first period. Due to the disrespectful graffiti found in the boys restroom, this facility will remain locked until someone comes forward with information about who did it. The entire male population of our high school groaned at the same time. The crazy part was what the graffiti actually said. My friend Peyton had seen it Friday before they locked everything up. Someone had written HIGH in tiny letters on the bathroom stall. Not a curse word, not a drawing. Just I in black Sharpie about the size of a quarter. By lunch, the situation was getting desperate. Guys were asking teachers for hall passes to go to the nurse's office just to use that bathroom. But the school nurse caught on quick and started turning people away unless they were actually sick. Some guys tried using the staff bathroom, but got detention for that. A few desperate souls walked to The gas station across the street during lunch. But security started watching for that, too. We tried talking to Principal Carpenter. Reasonably. A group of five guys went to his office to explain that punishing 300 boys for one tiny word was insane. He sat behind his big desk with his arms crossed. Actions have consequences. When the vandal comes forward, everyone gets bathroom privileges back. By Wednesday, things were getting bad. Guys were dehydrated from not drinking water all day. The basketball team couldn't practice properly because half the players were holding it in. Parents started calling to complain, but Carpenter wouldn't budge. He sent out an email saying this was a lesson in collective responsibility. That's when Dean Patterson had his brilliant idea. He was this quiet kid.

So at my final divorce hearing, I wasn't supposed to say anything. My lawyer even told me to zip it and let him handle everything. My ex husband, Tyler, had been caught stealing money from his job and tried to pin it all on me with fake papers and forged signatures. The whole thing was insane. For over a year, cops were at my house. My bank accounts got frozen and people I thought were friends basically ghosted me. Meanwhile, Tyler's walking around like he's some misunderstood victim. And he even brought his new girlfriend to court. Yeah, the same girl he was cheating on me with while I was home with our twin boys. The courtroom was packed. Tyler had his whole family there supporting him. I just had my sister Kim and my lawyer. The prosecute, Peter, had just finished showing all the evidence that proved Tyler not only forged my name on loan papers, but also used our kids Social Security numbers to open fake credit cards. Like, who does that to their own children? The judge asked Tyler if he wanted to say anything. Of course, he stood up and gave this whole sob story about being a devoted father and husband who was just trying to provide for his family. He actually had the nerve to say that I had manipulated the situation and that everyone in the courtroom knew I Wasn't the innocent person I was pretending to be. When he sat down, he had this smug little smile on his face like he just won an Oscar. Then the judge looked right at me and asked if I wanted to say anything before the final decision. I hadn't planned on speaking at all, but something inside me just snapped. Maybe it was seeing his girlfriend sitting there in the front row.

Living with Emma was honestly the best roommate situation I'd ever had. We got along great, had similar schedules, shared the same taste in Netflix shows and rarely had any drama. But then there was her boyfriend, Jake, who made things increasingly awkward every single time he came over to our apartment. At first, I thought maybe he just didn't like me or felt uncomfortable around Emma's friends in general. Some guys are just weird about their girlfriends, roommates, right? But then I started noticing this really specific, like, and strange pattern that made absolutely no sense. Every single time Emma would leave the room, whether she was running to the corner store, taking a long shower, grabbing something from her car downstairs, doing laundry in the basement, or even just going to the bathroom for two minutes, Jake would suddenly transform into this fidgety, nervous, sweating mess around me. It wasn't just normal social awkwardness either. The guy would literally find the most ridiculous excuse, this is to leave whatever room I was in the exact moment Emma disappeared from sight. If she went to grab mail from downstairs, he'd suddenly remember he urgently needed to check his phone outside on the balcony. If she hopped in the shower, he'd claim he had to move his car because of street cleaning or call his mom back about some fake emergency. It was like he was Physically allergic to being alone with me for even 30 seconds. I started timing it out of curiosity and he'd never last more than 20 seconds in this same room as me without Emma there as a buffer. The whole situation was getting absolutely ridiculous. I'd be sitting on the couch watching television. Emma would get up to make popcorn in the kitchen and Jake would immediately start pacing around like he was trapped in a cage with a wild animal. He check his watch constantly, glanced toward wherever Emma went every few seconds and basically act like he was doing some kind of mental countdown timer until she returned to save him. Emma started joking that he was legitimately afraid of me, asking if I said something threatening to scare him off or if I had some kind of intimidating aura she didn't know about. But honestly, we barely ever talked when she wasn't around because he was always so eager to escape any potential one on one interaction. This went on for months. Every movie night, every dinner, every casual hangout in the same weird dance. Emma leaves, Jake panics, Jake finds excuse to leave. Emma returns, Jake acts totally normal again. It was like watching someone flip a switch. Last week when Emma went to pick up our Chinese takeout order from the restaurant down the street, Jake was doing his usual nervous routine, shifting around on the couch, checking his phone every five seconds. Clear, we Planning his next escape route. That's when I finally decided I had enough of whatever this bizarre situation was. I confronted him straight up, asking why he acted so incredibly weird around me whenever Emma wasn't there to supervise us. Was it something specific I had done? Did he have some serious problem with me that he couldn't just talk about like a normal adult human being? That's when Jake completely broke down and admitted something I never saw coming in a million years. He developed serious romantic feelings for me over the past few months but was desperately trying to fight them by avoiding any situation where we might actually connect or have a real conversation without Emma there. He explained that he'd been with Emma for over a year and genuinely cared about her. But somewhere along the way, he'd started noticing things about me that made him question everything about their relationship. The way I laughed at his jokes, how we had eerily similar taste in music and movies, how ridiculously easy it was to talk to me during group conversations. The worst part was learning that he'd been seriously planning to break up with Emma because he felt so guilty about having feelings for someone else. I won't lie, I did like him a little, maybe more than I should have. The way we clicked, the way he noticed things about me. Emma never did. It got in my head. But in that moment, I saw The guilt in his eyes, and I knew I'd never trust myself if I let anything happen. So I told him to be honest with Emma, then leave. He did. Emma cried for two days, then quietly said, thanks for not being like him. We never talked about it again.

I was half asleep in 3rd period algebra when Principal Rodriguez's voice cut through the classroom speaker system. But something was different. Her usual cheerful tone was replaced by something cold and urgent. Attention all students and faculty, we need everyone to remain exactly where you are. Do not leave your classrooms under any circumstances. My math teacher, Mr Peterson, stopped mid equation. Shock hovering over the board. The entire class looked around confused. Sarah, who sits behind me whispered, what's going on? Furthermore, Principal Rodriguez continued, her voice shaking slightly. We need every student to carefully examine their personal belongings. Check your backpacks, purses, jackets, anything you brought to school today. Now I was really confused. Check our stuff for what? If you discover any item that does not belong to you, any electronic device, package or object you don't recognize, do not touch it. Immediately raise your hand and your teacher will handle the situation. The classroom fell dead silent. My stomach started churning as I slowly unzip my backpack. Everything looked normal until I reached the bottom of it. There was something there, a small black rectangular device about the size of a deck of cards with wires sticking out in a tiny red light blinking. I've never seen it before in my life. My hand shot up so fast it nearly gave me whiplash. Mister Peterson, I called out, trying to keep my voice steady. I think I Found something. He rushed over to my desk, looked into my bag and his face went complete. Without saying a word. He grabbed his classroom phone and dialed the main office. We have a situation in Room 237, he said quietly into the receiver. Yes, another one, another one. How many kids had found these things? Within two minutes, our classroom door burst open. It wasn't another teacher. With three people in full tactical gear with bomb squad printed across their vests, the lead officer approached my desk calmly but quickly. Everyone needs to evacuate. His head to the gym. We headed into the gymnasium where Principal Rodriguez was waiting with a microphone, flanked by police officers and FBI agents. FBI agents at our school, students. She began, her voice barely steady. What I'm about to tell you is very serious. We received an anonymous tip this morning that explosive devices have been planted throughout the school. The entire gymnasium erupted in gasps and screams. Some kids started crying immediately. My best friend Jake grabbed my arm so tight it hurt. We have discovered 12 devices total planted in random students belongings. The bomb squad is currently securing each device to determine if they pose a genuine threat. For the next three hours, we sat in that gymnasium while bomb squad technicians work through the school. Parents were called, news vans showed up outside and helicopters circled overhead. Finally around two PM, an FBI agent took them. Microphone, we can Confirm that all devices were fake. However, this was not a harmless prank. This was a deliberate act of terrorism designed to cause fear and disruption. He paused, scanning the crowd of students. We have arrested the individual responsible. This person will face federal charges for making terrorist threats, causing public panic and endangering the welfare of minors. The room buzzed with whispers. Who could have done this? The perpetrator, the agent. Continue is Marcus Williams, a senior at this school. Marcus Williams, I knew him. He was in my chemistry class, always making jokes, always trying to be the center of attention. Turns out Marcus had spent weeks planning this prank. He built fake explosive devices using electronics ordered online, then snuck them into random students bags during lunch periods and passing time. He thought it would be hilarious to watch the school panic. His plan was to reveal it was all a joke. After the evacuation, expect everyone to laugh and call him a genius. Instead, he's now facing 20 years in federal prison for domestic terrorism charges. His college acceptance to Stanford was immediately revoked. His parents had to sell their house to pay for legal fees. The FBI put him on a permanent watch list. His whole life was destroyed because he wanted to create a viral moment.

Movers arrived at 9:00am, efficiently packing my belongings. By 11:00am, they were gone. I left divorce papers on the dining table, all communication through my attorney. The sense of calm was surreal. Seventy two hours later, the barrage began. 21 missed calls, 31 texts, all blocked. Panic was clear. She hadn't expected me to fight back. Legally, her mother called. You have responsibility. Responsibilities to a child that isn't mine and a woman who deliberately deceived me. Vanessa contacted Jessica with threats. He can leave if he wants, but he needs to keep supporting us. Jessica's response was perfect. My client never discussed any arrangement regarding a child that isn't his. We have DNA confirmation and documentation of your admission of paternity fraud. Her sister cornered me. This isn't how things were supposed to go. You were supposed to leave amicably and support them financially. Not my child, not my problem. She thought you'd be reasonable and do the right thing. So that was the plan. I either stay and raise another man's child or leave but still pay for everything. The entitlement was staggering. Six weeks later at the hearing, the judge wasn't impressed, especially after Jessica played a voicemail Vanessa left. My brother. I'll drag this out until his lawyer bills bankrupt him. Four months later, it was over. The house sold with eight 80% of proceeds to me. Vanessa was ordered to pay $8,000. Of my legal fees. I was legally established as not being the father with no support obligation. Six months later, I saw her sitting on a bench across the street, baby in a stroller. She looked different, thinner, wearing jeans instead of designer clothes. I lost my job. My parents are moving to Florida. Florida. I don't have anywhere to go. Alec still won't acknowledge the baby. I'm sleeping in my car some nights. What do you want from me, Vanessa? Help. Maybe you know someone who needs an assistant. Vanessa, I said as I walked away, you called me a loser for not accepting your manipulation. How's that working out for you?

When I confronted her, she said, yeah, he's not even yours. What are you going to do? Divorce me? This is a no fault state. I'm taking half. Loser. It was day 5 since my son was born. I was sorting through hospital paperwork when I saw it. The birth certificate didn't say James Taylor like we'd agreed. Instead, Alexander Reynolds Taylor. Alexander, her ex's name. The name hit me like a truck. Vanessa, what's this? I asked. The certificate says Alexander, not James. She glanced up from her phone. Oh, yeah, last minute change of heart. Alexander sounds better. Alexander, like your ex. Something shifted in her face. Cold calculation replaced new mother exhaustion. Surprised you caught that so quickly, she said with an ugly laugh, why would you name our son after your ex? Cause he's not our son, Mark. He's Alex's son. The room seemed to tilt. The baby isn't yours. Alex and I have been seeing each other for about a year. I stared at her, blood rushing in my ears. What are you going to do about it? Divorce me? She laughed coldly. This is a no fault state. Get half of everything either way. The house, your savings, plus child support. Stay and play, daddy, or leave and pay. Either way, I win. She turned back to her phone like she just discussed the weather. I didn't say a Word, just turned around and walked out. My first call was to a DNA testing facility. They could see me tomorrow. Second call was to a divorce lawyer who squeezed me in that afternoon. Jessica Winters explained no fault. Divorce doesn't mean what your wife thinks. It doesn't guarantee her half your assets, especially with evidence of fraud, paternity fraud, putting you on another man's birth certificate knowingly, that's fraud. Jessica outlined the plan. Get the DNA test, get other financial records, secure valuables, find new housing. Most importantly, don't tip your hand. Let her think she's winning. The more complacent she is, the better. Three days later, DNA confirmed the baby wasn't mine. I spent the next week securing documents and researching apartment. Our home was mostly purchased with money from my software business that sold before we married.

So I figured out how to make them pay for it anyway, one documented household contract at a time. The lawyer watched me sue my own parents into paying double my college fund and told them it was their own fault. 18 years of watching my brother get everything, I've been patient. Then they bought him that Honda after spending my future and gave me the opportunity I didn't know I was waiting for. I came home from my part time job excited, ready to submit my college deposit, only to find my savings account empty. Not just low, drained like they'd claimed the deed to my future. The College Fund Sarah label on the account might as well have been written in Sanscript. I stared at the screen, my dreams effectively evaporating and went numb. Eighteen years of being the good daughter had officially meant nothing. Around dinner time, my parents called me down like they were hosting a Celebration. I found them in the dining room with my brother, champagne glasses raised, car keys glinting on the table. No warning, no discussion, just announcing they'd bought him a new Honda. The pride in their voices made my stomach turn. I asked about my college fund. My mother actually waved her hand and said he needed it more, like I was being selfish when I demanded to know how I'd pay for college. Now my father leaned back in his chair, actually leaned back like I was overreacting. I told them I start school in three months. Face shifted into this dismissive expression before he said the four words that sealed their fate. You'll figure it out. Those words flipped a switch in my brain. 18 years of straight A's, 18 years of being responsible, 18 years of Sarah can handle it excuses, but dismissing my entire future as my problem to solve. I walked upstairs already googling tenant rights and educational support laws. Through my window, I heard them laughing downstairs, toasting my brother's success. Then I found the legal precedent I needed. Perfect. I was ready to play this game. I printed out enrollment forms for community college and started drafting my first household contract, fingers flying across the keyboard. My business law textbook from high school suddenly became my bible. I created itemized bills for everything, rent as a full time student, transportation to campus, educational supplies I'd need. The law was clear. Parents who could afford support had obligations to full time students under 24. I calculated 18 years of being told to be responsible, time to show them what responsibility looked like. I presented them with the first invoice Monday morning, 30 beautiful pages itemized ahead. So I calmly informed them I'd enrolled in community college full time and moved back home permanently, but they could expect monthly bills for my educational necessities. The silence that filled the Kitchen probably could have been cut with a knife. My brother mentioned something about being dramatic. I just smiled and threw their own words back at them. I'm figuring it out. They tried everything. Locked me out Monday afternoon. Cops made them let me in, change the refrigerator lock. I documented denial of necessities. Dad hid the car keys. I build for Ubers with educational purpose receipts. Tuesday, they got creative and tried to have me evicted. The lawyer they hired took one look at my documentation, told them I was a legal tenant with student protections, then left after I served him with my own counter suit papers. Mom even called my aunts to intervene and offered me 2000 to drop it. But I just kept filing documents, building my case from my bedroom like it was my job. By Tuesday night, news had spread through the family group chat. My grandmother called me directly, said it was about time someone held them accountable. Bank statement started arriving daily like my education was a business acquisition. My brother kept trying to guilt me in shifts like he was running some kind of family reconciliation service. Tuesday morning of week 3, 7 a. M. I heard them outside my door. There they were holding an envelope looking like they've been up all night. We made eye contact as I walked out in my interview attire. Their eyes lit up with hope. They actually smiled, probably thinking their nightmare was finally Ending then my lawyer pulled up. I hopped right in the car because I had court that day for our first judgment. The look on their faces, pure, crushing defeat. No words needed. They knew exactly what I was doing. I'd won without raising my voice, without family drama, without breaking a single law, just three years of documented financial obligation. Same evening, I transferred to my dream university, full ride mysteriously covered by family contributions. And when I got home around midnight, still grinning from what turned out to be the best acceptance call I'd ever received, the Honda was gone, just tire marks on the driveway and a faint smell of burnt rubber where my brother must have peeled out.

I started making indie games back before Steam Greenlight existed. I wasn't successful by any means, but Glenn always tagged along. Family supports family, my parents said, only to regret those words later. For two years, I worked at game development like clockwork. I'd spent Saturdays coding mechanics and Sundays designing levels. Until 3:00am Glenn inserted himself into everything. He'd hover over my shoulder giving suggestions, credit for my pixel art and even told people we were co developers at family gatherings. My parents thought this was wonderful. Even before all this, I had loved creating games. So to have a small following on itch dot Io and parents who forced me to share this with Glenn was already wearing me down. But one day I suddenly hit my first thousand downloads. My parents insisted Glenn and I celebrate together since he was part of the team. Then posted about our achievement on social media. We're heading to 10,000 next. I felt so trapped. Even though he never wrote a line of code or designed a single Sprite, my parents still insisted I include him in everything and I hated them for it. Then after one year of development, I finally got the email I've been waiting for. Publisher wanted to fund my next project. My heart raced and I knew I wouldn't be able to focus at school after That. So I headed home early, planning to work on the contract proposal alone, but Glen was already there. Hi, your mom let me in, he said from my desk chair. She said, we should work on our next game together. Can't wait to see what we create. Perfect, I thought sarcastically. I had to share even this. My latest build was running on the screen. The platformer I'd spent months perfecting. Tight controls, innovative mechanics, pixel perfect collision. Oh man, this will probably be our best game yet. Can't wait to show everyone, Glen said while he played, his discord notification popped up. I glanced over without thinking and felt my heart stop. I didn't realize he left his messages open until it was too late. Until I saw everything I shouldn't have. Still pretending to make games with your loser cousin, his friend Paul asked. Yep, another Friday watching him code while I get credit, his parents literally force him to include me. Ben, Beer, please. Lol. My hand trembled on my mouse. I knew I should have looked away, but I had to know what else he said. So I scrolled up through two years of messages between him, Paul and his college friends. I felt my rage build with each text every single weekend. I thought we were collaborating. He was mocking me. He spent our entire Saturday debugging again. Thank god his parents are delusional at least. Paul bragged about his internship at a real Game studio. Glen replied, lucky mine thinks making flash games is a career. Sad face. When I got 1,000 downloads and we celebrated, he'd message them saying, I acted like notch over 1,000 randoms on the internet. Just take credit and bounce when something real comes along, Paul advised. My vision blurred as I went through it all, realizing just how wrong I'd been about everything. Glenn then went on a long rant about how he'd been padding his resume with my work, using my games in his portfolio for job applications. Indy games earn nothing, but they look great on applications. It's like having a free intern. I only stick around for the resume padding and clearly this kid will never make it big. Everyone laughed in the chat, mocking my work, praising him for the smart play. I realized no one respected my work, especially not Glen. And that's what hurt me the most, not the mockery, but the theft. I sat there staring at my setup, at the publisher email, at Glen playing my game. Then I looked at his discord at the portfolio site. He'd linked the job application drafts, taking credit for everything I'd created, everything he'd stolen while pretending to support. So I included him in something new. I replied to the publisher with Glen C. Seed accepting their offer. I included screenshots of his messages claiming sole credit. I included his portfolio showing my work as his. I included everything just like my Parents wanted. Since Glen insists he's the real developer, I'm sure he can handle the contract negotiations and technical requirements alone. The publishers response was swift. They'd already researched my work, knew Glen had never contributed. They forwarded everything to the game development community he'd applied to, posted warnings about portfolio theft. Glen tried damage control, begging me to retract. My parents finally saw the messages, saw how he'd use their family supports family rule to steal my future. His job offers evaporated. Game studios blacklisted him. My parents apologized for forcing me to include him, calling themselves naive and distant. But who wouldn't be angry after being forced to be robbed? Glenn ended up in accounting, never touched game development again. But then 10 years later, it happened. My eight year old son, an iPad kid, handed me his tablet and showed me a game he made in scratch. Can you help me add enemies, dad? Of course, kiddo. That's what real family does, I told him. His face lit up. Mom said you made real games. Once I stared into his eyes and felt all the anger finally fade, I opened my old development software for the first time in years and taught him everything Glenn never bothered to learn.

Every morning at 6:00am, I watch the same woman destroy our entire staff sanity with four words. Three eighth, vanilla pump. Veronica wanted exactly three eighth of a pump of vanilla in her latte because apparently, that extra eighth and a half pump was unbearably sweet. And thanks to Starbucks, sacred customers always write policy. We had to Mark fractions on our pump and pretend this made sense. But even though we made it exactly her way, she always said the first drink was wrong. She'd swirl it once, purse her lips without tasting, and declare it wrong. Too sweet, she'd announce. Or barely any vanilla at all. Then she'd tap her manicured nails on the counter while we remade it. My manager, Brett, would hover nearby, mouthing, just do it! Whenever we hesitated. Three weeks in, I accidentally handed Veronica back her rejected drink instead of the remake. My stomach dropped. She took a sip. Finally, someone who listens, she said, dropping a dollar in our tip jar like she was bestowing a kingdom. Wait, what? The next morning, I tested it again. Rejected drink, fake remake. Hand back the same cup. Perfect, she declared. For over a year, this became my morning theater. Once my co workers discovered the trick, it became our secret rebellion. We kept a hidden scoreboard tracking who could pull off the most ridiculous remake. Tessa won the speed category by simply turning around and turning Back eight seconds flat. Marcus, 17 and fearless, once served Veronica the same drink four times in a single visit. Each time, she declared it wrong. By the fourth identical cup, she finally proclaimed it perfect and lectured him about resistance. Jerome to the creativity prize when he accidentally dropped her cup, caught it midair, and explained that the sudden agitation had redistributed the milk proteins and broken the surface tension, creating optimal flavor integration. She tipped him $3 and nodded like she knew exactly what that meant. My personal triumph happened on a Monday when Veronica stormed in, already screaming into her phone about someone's incompetence. She hung up and snapped her fingers at me without looking up, but before she could order, I slid a drink across the counter. Your usual? I actually made three versions this morning since it was slow and this was the only one that met your standards. She stopped midreach. You pre made my drink? I nodded throughout. Two already. This one has exactly three eights. She picked it up suspiciously, took a sip, and her whole face changed. Finally. Good girl. She patted the counter like I was a dog who Learned a trick. This is what I've been training you for. She dropped a 10 in the tip jar and told the next customer how she'd broken me improperly. The drink I handed her yesterday's leftover batch from the fridge that Marcus was about to throw out. Heat it up in The microwave. By month six, we weren't even trying to hide it. While Veronica screamed into her phone about work stuff. I take her cup, wait three seconds, hand it back. Marcus would remake drinks without moving. Tessa straight up told her, still the same drink. Nothing changed. Here you go. Veronica was too busy scream about deadlines to notice. She grabbed it mid rant, took a sip, and threw us a thumbs up without missing a beat. My last shift before college was supposed to be quiet. Instead, the place was pure chaos. Blenders shrieking out, Frappuccinos every 10 seconds, milk steamer screaming, sticky syrup coating every surface. Then Veronica strutted in, wearing designer sunglasses, indoors, practically shouting into her phone about her assistance and competence. She cut through the line of 12 people, planted herself at the register, and without even acknowledging me, yelled over the noise. God, this place is a zoo. I can barely hear myself think. The words flew out before I could stop them. Funny, I can still hear you complaining. The entire store froze. A kid dropped his K pop. Veronica slowly removed her sunglasses. Excuse me? I said. I can still hear you. Just like every morning for the past year. I leaned across the counter, speaking loud enough for everyone to hear. Just like how you've been drinking the same wrong drink for a year and calling it perfect. 412 days of swallowing your own rejection, by the way. Three eights. Is just a half pump to us. Her face went pinker than a venti pink drink. Liar! She slammed both hands on the counter. Fire her now! She screamed at Brett, who just walked out of the back. She's lying to humiliate me! I spent thousands here! Brett, who lived by the employee handbook, knew firing me would tank his court early review. He cleared his throat. Ma'am, today is her last shift anyway. That's it. She stormed outside with her phone facing the sidewalk. For two straight hours on hold with corporate. We watched through the windows as she gestured wildly at no one. After her call went nowhere, she marched back in, curled her sunglasses at the window, where they shattered on impact, and screamed, I will never come back to this location. Then she ran to her white Mercedes and sped off. I worked my last two hours with the biggest smile. A month later, Marcus texted me. She still hasn't been back. We're free. I've given my co workers the ultimate gift. A Veronica free workplace. And me? I got the perfect last day.

Because they can. Like, I know you want to impress the boys, but it's kind of embarrassing. You're embarrassing cause no one can impress them except me. You're only disappointing me for now. You guys look uglier than you do without makeup. Are you talking about yourself? The only time I have makeup on my face is when my mom kisses my cheek. Your mom is only trying to cover the fact she don't want you by giving you kisses. And I remove it right after. Your mom wanted to remove pregnancy, but she was forced to keep you. Honestly, it's so embarrassing seeing girls with so much makeup. It's so embarrassing seeing you. Like I just want to vomit on their faces. What about I'll vomit on your face instead? Cause even my vomit looks better than the chemicals they have on their faces. Then put your vomit on your face and let me in on a secret. You girls aren't making anyone stare except old men. I'm sure you're not making anyone stare at you, dot as well. Even the old men and the rest of the stairs are boys wondering why is your face look so ugly. Lol. I guess you're now talking about the stairs the dot boys give you while being scared of your face. Like, I'm so happy I have beautiful natural skin unlike those ugly girls with so much acne and pimples. I'm just reminding you Pimples and acne are natural. And you'll have them to someday when you'll grow up. Kid that have to put makeup on so that we don't look like an elephant. You're the one who looks like 10,000 pounds elephant. So stop trying so hard cause the boys only like me. Hehehe. Love ya. The boys only have nightmares after seeing you. Anyways. Love my all girlies and boys no out.

I'm three hours away. That's too far. I'm selling it now. I bought that car when my dad passed away. You can't sell it. Boohoo! Man up, bet. Do you still have the yellow Ferrari? Yes. Price is $250,000. Great. Is there any damage on the vehicle? Maybe a small rip on the passenger seat. Uh, yeah. How did you know? That was my Ferrari five years ago, before I got kidnapped by the Mafia. I'm sorry to hear that. Are you here to buy it, or are you just reminiscing? The Mafia was trying to find the money I stole from them, but they couldn't. Do you want the car or not? I don't have time for stories. Okay, I'll cut to the good part. The money I stole is hidden in that Ferrari. Is the Mafia gonna find me? If you don't do exactly what I say? I will tell them you have the car. What do I need to do? Go to that underground garage and park it up. Hide the keys in the wheel well, and then run away as fast as you can. Okay, I'm going now. Please don't tell the Mafia. I won't. Okay, I did it. Good. Girl. Babe, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have tried to sell your car. Why the sudden change of heart? It had money hidden inside it. Stolen from the Mafia. This guy messaged me and told me to hide it in a garage, so I did. Now I'm just running home. I don't know what to do. Are you almost home? Yes. Thanks for keeping it safe. Stupid ass. Wait, that was you? You're so blonde. How could anyone own it before me? I bought it from the dealership. Babe, please forgive me. It was just a silly mistake. Now we're getting a divorce. And after the judge hears this, you won't get a penny from me. You'll be homeless. You for the streets anyway. No, baby, you can't make me homeless. Boohoo! Woman up!

What happened? I'm a pediatric dentist and kids say the craziest stuff when they're coming out of anesthesia. Most of the time it's hilarious nonsense about unicorns or how their tooth tastes like chicken nuggets. But one Tuesday morning changed everything for me. I had just finished pulling a loose baby tooth for this sweet six year old named Harper. It was still pretty loopy from the numbing medicine, giggling and trying to touch her numb lip with her tongue. Her mom was filling out paperwork in the waiting room while I cleaned up. That's when Harper started babbling about candy. Nothing unusual there. Kids always want to know when they can eat sweets again after dental work. You know what my uncle tells me when he gives me candy? She slurred her words, all wonky from the numbness. I smiled, expecting some silly family joke. No, sweetie, what does he say? He says it's only for special girls like me. She paused, trying to focus her droopy eyes on me. But I can. Can't tell Mommy about our candy game. It's our secret. My hands froze while I was putting away the dental tools. Something in my stomach dropped hard. Harper, where do you and your uncle play this candy game? I asked, trying to keep my voice normal. In the garage when Mommy's at work, he says all special girls get candy if they're really Good. And don't tell anyone, she giggled again, completely unaware of what she was revealing. I felt sick. 20 years of treating kids and you develop instincts about these things. This wasn't innocent. Does your uncle visit a lot? I asked gently. Harper nodded enthusiastically. He lives with us now, Mommy says. He helps pay for our house so he can stay forever and ever. My heart was pounding. I finished cleaning Harper's mouth and walked her back to her mom in the waiting room. Acting as normal as possible, I gave them the usual aftercare instructions about soft foods and gentle brushing. The moment they left, I locked my office door and called the state child abuse hotline. I never had to make that call before, but I knew I had to. The social worker I spoke with took detailed notes about everything Harper had said. She explained they would need to interview Harper properly with trained specialists who know how to talk to kids about these situations. Within two days, Harper was brought in for a forensic interview at the Children's Advocacy Center.

I work as a court clerk and I've seen some brutal custody fights. Parents using kids as weapons, lying about each other, spending fortunes on lawyers just to hurt their ex. But last month, I witnessed something that still keeps me up at night. This couple, Sarah and Mike, were divorcing after 15 years. They had twin eight year olds, Luna and Jake. The hearing started like all the others. Lawyers arguing, accusations flying, both parents claiming the other was unfit. Then the judge asked to speak with the children privately. Luna and Jake came in holding hands, looking terrified. The judge, who's usually pretty stern, softened his voice. Kids, I know this is scary. Can you tell me what you want? Luna, the braver twin, spoke up, we want to stay together, and we want mom and dad to stop being mad. Jake nodded and whispered, we don't care where we live. We just want everyone to be happy again. The judge asked, if you had to choose one parent to live with, who would it be? Both kids started crying. Luna said, that's not fair. We love them both the same. Here's where it gets heartbreaking. The judge called the parents back in and repeated what the kids said. Sarah immediately started sobbing. Mike put his head in his hands. For a moment, it looked like they might work something out. Sarah looked at Mike with Tears in her eyes and said, maybe we can figure out joint custody for their sake. Mike nodded. Hopefully. I'd like that. These kids didn't ask for this divorce. But then Sarah's lawyer whispered something in her ear. Her expression completely changed. She straightened up and said coldly, actually, your honor, I've changed my mind. I want full custody. Mike travels too much for work, and he's never been the primary caregiver. Mike's face went white. Sarah, what are you doing? We just agreed I was being emotional, but I need to think about what's best for my children. Mike's lawyer jumped in with counter arguments, but the damage was done. The hearing turned ugly fast. Sarah brought up every mistake Mike had ever made. The time he was late picking them up, the weekend he had to work during his custody time, even the fact that he didn't know Luna's teacher's name. Mike fought back, mentioning Sarah's drinking problem from three years ago, that she'd gotten help for her mother's interference, her tendency to bad mouth him in front of the kids. Luna and Jake sat in the hallway, listening to their parents destroy each other through the courtroom doors. After three hours of brutal testimony, the judge

Okay, let's get out of here. Run. No, we promised we'd clean up our mess. Who cares? It's not our job to clean the store. You made your skincare smoothie. Now clean it up. No, I'm gonna tell mom you were bad again. Do you wanna be in trouble again? Because the last time you did this, you got your Xbox taken away. Okay, fine. There it's gone.
