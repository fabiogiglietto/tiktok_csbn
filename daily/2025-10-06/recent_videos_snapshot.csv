When I was 12, I discovered I could taste colors, not metaphorically. I literally tasted them. Blue was salty. Red was sweet. Yellow made me gag. I thought everyone experienced this until I mentioned that the blue crayon tasted like ocean water. And my teacher sent me to the nurse. My parents took me to specialist after specialist. They diagnosed me with synesthesia, a rare neurological condition where senses crosswire. Only one in 2,000 people have it. I felt like a freak. Kids at school called me Taste Girl and would wave colorful objects in my face, asking what they tasted like. During lunch, they'd hold up their bright lunch boxes and demand I describe the flavors. The red apple packaging tasted like cherry candy, but I'd lie and say I didn't know, just to make. I Learned to hide it completely. For years, I pretended to be normal while secretly navigating a world where every color had a flavor. Grocery stores were overwhelming. The bright product packaging created a symphony of tastes in my mouth. I'd shop with my eyes half closed, trying to minimize the sensory overload. My parents stopped talking about it after the initial diagnosis, treated it like an embarrassing family secret. When relatives visited, mom would quietly warn me not to mention the color thing because it made people uncomfortable. High school was torture. Art class was the worst. All those vibrant paints made my Mouth water and revolt simultaneously. I switched to black and white photography just to avoid the taste chaos. Then in college, everything changed. I was sitting in my psychology class half asleep during a lecture about rare neurological conditions when the professor mentioned synesthesia. During the discussion, this guy, Ben, raised his hand and said, I have that. Blue tastes salty to me. My heart stopped. I'd never met another person like me. I spent the rest of the lecture staring at the back of his head, afraid to hope. After class, I approached him nervously, my hands literally shaking. What does red taste like, I asked, barely above a whisper. Sweet like candy, he replied immediately, his eyes lighting up. That simple exchange felt like coming home after years of exile. We spent the next four hours in the campus coffee shop comparing our experiences. Yellow made him gag, too, like rotten eggs, he said. Purple was bitter, almost medicinal. Green was minty fresh, which made us both laugh because we'd independently started associating it with toothpaste. For the first time in my life, I didn't feel alone. Someone else understood why I couldn't eat on plates, why I prefer wear neutral coloured clothes, why certain movie scenes made me physically nauseous from the colour combinations. We started dating six months later, then understood my world in ways no one else could. When I said the sunset tasted like strawberries and lime, he knew exactly what I meant when We watched fireworks. We'd compare flavor notes like wine connoisseurs. He helped me embrace my synesthesia instead of hiding it. We'd go to art museums together, sharing whispered descriptions of what each painting taste it like. Van Gogh's Starry Night was a complex blend of vanilla, salt and something metallic that we could never quite identify. Then made me feel special instead of strange. She'd bring me flowers and specific that color combinations because he knew they'd create interesting flavor profiles. Once he surprised me with a bouquet arranged in gradient order so I could taste the rainbow properly. Three years later, he proposed with a blue sapphire ring because he knew it would taste like our first conversation, salty and unforgettable. I said yes immediately, tears streaming down my face. Finally, someone who truly understood me. But here's the twist that shattered everything. Last week, while helping him move some books, I found his old psychology textbook. It was filled with highlighted sections about synesthesia, detailed notes about common taste associations and even a handwritten chart matching colors to flavors. My blood ran cold.

My four year old daughter, Ruby, was obsessed with our mailman, Eddie. Every day at exactly two PM, she'd press her face against our living room window and wave frantically. When he delivered our mail, Eddie always waved back and sometimes made funny faces that sent Ruby into giggles. This went on for two years until everything changed. Eddie was arrested and charged with stealing prescription medications from mailboxes. Several elderly residents in our apartment complex reported missing pills. Heart medication, diabetes supplies, painkillers. The evidence seemed overwhelming. Eddie was the only person with master access to all the mailboxes. And when police searched his mail truck, they found a stash of various prescription bottles hidden under his seat. Eddie insisted someone had entered the substances, but who would believe a mailman over multiple victims? The stolen medications were worth thousands on the street. Eddie was facing federal charges for mail theft and substance trafficking, which carried a minimum sentence. And survive years in federal prison. The prosecutor painted Eddie as a calculated criminal who exploited his trusted position to prey on vulnerable seniors. Eddie's wife broke down in court, begging people to believe leave her husband's innocence. Their three young kids didn't understand why daddy couldn't come home. Eddie's overworked public defender seemed ready to push for a plea deal. The case looked hopeless. That's when I remembered Ruby's obsessive daily routine. She didn't just wave at Eddie. She Provided running commentary on everything he did, like her own personal nature documentary. For two years, she'd narrated Eddie's every move while perched at that window. I contacted Eddie's lawyer about Ruby's detailed observations. He was desperate and skeptical, but agreed to let her testify as a character witness. The day of Ruby's testimony, the courtroom was packed. Ruby walked to the witness box clutching her favorite toy mail truck, looking tiny in the oversized chair. The judge had to lower the microphone to her level. Eddie's lawyer knelt down to Ruby's eye level. Ruby, you watch Eddie deliver mail every day, right? Ruby nodded solemnly. Every single day at two clock. Eddie's my friend. What exactly do you see Eddie do with the mailboxes? Ruby's face grew serious, like she was sharing important grown up information. Eddie never opens the mailboxes. He only puts mail in, never takes mail out. That's the rule. How can you be so sure? Because I watch everything. Eddie only touches the little mail slot part. He slides letters in and closes it. But the sneaky

Made you realize you couldn't trust them? My sister and I are both pregnant right now. She's due in a few weeks, and I've got a little over two months left. We're both having boys, but my husband and I haven't told anyone the name yet, not even our parents, because, honestly, I don't trust my sister with it. It sounds dramatic, but I've got reasons. When she had her daughter three years ago, she and her best friend were pregnant at the same time, and every time we saw them together, they were whispering about baby names and changing their minds every week. My sister kept saying they were stuck and couldn't decide on one. Then, out of nowhere, the day before she gave birth, she suddenly had a name picked first and middle. And it was exactly what her best friend had been planning to name her baby girl. Same spelling, too. That blew up fast. Her friend found out from the announcement post and was so blindsided, she showed up at the hospital to confront her. They fought in the hospital room while my mom tried to calm them down. My sister just shrugged and said it was first come, first serve and that her friend could have picked a new one if it really mattered. They don't speak anymore, so when my husband and I found out we were having a boy, we agreed we wouldn't share the name until he's Born! My sister asked if we had decided on the name yet a few weeks ago while we were helping our mom set up for Easter brunch and I said no. She gave me this fake casual oh, just wondering and change the subject, but the next time I saw her she circled back to it saying name talk was her favorite part of pregnancy and asking what names we were thinking about. I said we hadn't decided. She kept pushing saying maybe she could help brainstorm. I threw out a few obviously fake names just to shut her down, things like Maverick and blue, but she caught on and narrowed her eyes saying I was being weird about something that's supposed to be fun. I told her we just weren't ready to share yet, but she didn't let it go. Last weekend during a family dinner at our parents place, she brought it up again, this time in front of everyone. she bet we were probably using the name her husband had picked if their daughter had been a boy. Just casually tossed it out there like a joke. But before I could respond, our brother jumped in and said don't tell her anything. She already stole one baby name, she'll do it again. The whole room went quiet. My sister looked at me like I told him even though I hadn't said a word. She asked if that was why I wouldn't tell her I didn't Answer. So she doubled down. Said I was holding a grudge over something she never did to me and that I was treating her like a thief over a name. She turned to our mom like she was hoping for backup. Mom

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he'd just say, what's next, Sir, one Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Because she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd

I know that sounds weird coming from a white girl, but hear me out. This whole thing started about three years ago when I was living in Atlanta for my internship. My usual salon back home was, like, four hours away, and I was desperate for a trim because my hair looked like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. My roommate, Keisha, was getting ready to head out to her salon and saw me struggling with my messy curls in the bathroom mirror. She just laughed and said, girl, come with me. My stylist will sort you out. I was hesitant because I'd never been to a black salon before, but honestly, my hair was so bad, I would have tried anything. Walking into that salon was like entering a whole different world. The energy was incredible. Everyone was talking, laughing, music playing, kids running around while their moms got their hair done. It felt alive in a way that the quiet, sterile salons I was used to never did. The stylist, Miss Janet, took one look at my hair and shook her head, baby, who's been cutting your hair? Because they need to stop. She started running her fingers through it, asking me about my routine, what products I used, how I dried it. Nobody had ever asked me those questions before. They just wet it, cut it, and send me on my way. Miss Janet spent two hours on my Hair. Two hours. She deep conditioned it, trimmed each curl individually, showed me how to scrunch it properly, and sent me home with specific instructions about what products to use and how often to wash it. My hair looked better than it ever had in my entire life. But here's the thing that really got me. She charged me $40. 40. The salon back home charged

So I went to this Applebee's last Friday night around eight PM I get seated at this booth near the back and my waiter comes over. Guy looked like he was in his early 20s, kind of scrawny with this patchy beard. He takes my drink order, just a Coke, and disappears. For like 15 minutes I'm sitting there looking around, watching other tables get their food and I'm still waiting for my damn soda. Finally, he shows up with my Coke, doesn't even apologize, just flops it down and asks what I want to eat. I order the chicken tenders with honey mustard and seasoned fries. Pretty basic stuff. He writes it down and vanishes again. 20 minutes go by, nothing. I can see him at the computer terminal just standing there scrolling on his phone. Other waiters are running around actually doing their jobs, but this guy is just chilling. I try to get his attention a couple times, but he's completely ignoring my section. After another 10 minutes, I flag down a different waitress, older lady with gray hair who looked like she actually cared about her job. I asked her if she knows what happened to my food order. She looks confused and goes to check. Turns out my waiter never even put my order in the system. The lady, her name tag said Janet, looked embarrassed as hell. She apologizes and immediately puts my order In says the kitchen will rush it. But now I've been sitting there for almost an hour with nothing but a warm Coke. My food finally comes out, but guess who brings it? Not my original waiter. Janet brings it over with another apology. The chicken tenders are overcooked and the fries are cold. At this point, I'm just hungry and tired, so I eat it anyway. The whole time I'm eating, I can see my waiter at the bar area talking to some girl who's clearly not working there. He's completely forgotten I exist. Never checked on me once after taking my drink order, never refilled my Coke, never even walked past my table. When I'm done eating, I have to wave down Janet again to get my check. He brings it over and I can tell she feels bad about the whole situation. The total was like 18 bucks. Here's where it gets interesting. Janet hands me the check and quietly says, don't worry about tipping Tommy. He didn't earn it tonight and everyone saw what happened. Apparently, this wasn't the first time this kid had pulled this crap. So I pay my $18 cash exact change and leave zero tip as I'm walking.

In my family, we had something called Health Day. Every Saturday morning at 9:00am sharp. We'd finish breakfast and dad would already have the basement ready with his white coat on and all his medical equipment laid out on metal trays in the basement. Our mom would kiss our foreheads before sending us down one by one. Then came the examinations, thorough inspections of every inch of our bodies while he muttered medical terms and scrub golden thick glue binders. He'd make us stand naked under the bright lights while he circled us slowly, his gloved fingers pressing into our skin, checking what he called abnormalities. He called it preventative care. I dreaded it every single week. The rule was you couldn't flinch or complain or you'd start over from the beginning. The strangest part, we weren't allowed to mention health day at school, not to teachers, not to friends. I only realised in middle school how weird that was, how other kids just went to pediatricians once a year, not secret basement clinics every week. But the worst part was the special examinations. If dad found something concerning during the regular check, you'd get called down on weeknights. He had this small locked room with bright lights and an exam table with stirrups. The metal was always cold and he'd spend what felt like hours with his instruments documenting every detail while telling us to relax and breathe. He said it was For comprehensive assessment. As a kid, I was terrified. I'd count the ceiling tiles over and over. But dad said fear meant you were taking your health seriously. When I got older, I started questioning everything. Why did we need weekly exams when no one else did? Why did mom drink before every health day? I remember once at 14, I asked if I could skip it for Rachel's sleepover. Dad gripped my wrist and stared at me with these desperate eyes. Health day is the only thing keeping you safe, he said. That's when I knew something was deeply wrong. Rachel's family had annual checkups, vaccination schedules, growth charts on the edge. No basement procedures, no locked rooms, no binders documenting their bodies, just normal healthcare. I finally refused to go downstairs when I turned 16. Dad went ballistic, screaming that I was ungrateful and didn't understand the dangers. Mom just stood there shaking. He locked me in my room and said I couldn't leave until I submitted to a full examination. The next morning, mom slipped me $20 under the door and whispered to use the window. When I came back that night, dad acted like nothing had happened. He just asked if I was ready for my examination like he hadn't imprisoned me the night before. That's when I started planning. Still, the whole thing ate at me. Why was dad so obsessed with our health when he wasn't even a doctor? Where did he get all That equipment. Three months later, I told my health teacher everything. Missus Patterson kept her face very still as I explained our Saturday routine. She said she needed to make a phone call. I knew what that meant. She came back with the principal. Then the police came, then Child Services. They took us out of class one by one, just like health day, except this time, we didn't go home. I'll never forget Dad's face when they arrested him.

I first noticed them in the cereal aisle, a well dressed woman carrying a crying little girl, maybe 3 years old. The child's face was red, tears streaming. But something about her cries seemed desperate, different, not like a tantrum. I'm a kindergarten teacher. After 15 years, you develop a sense for these things. The woman kept whispering. It's okay, sweetie, almost there. But she wasn't doing any of the natural things a parent does. No rubbing the back, no gentle bouncing, no terms of endearment that felt personal. I followed at a distance, pretending to shop. The girl's cries started changing, becoming more panicked. I want my mommy, she whispered. You said Mommy was here. The woman shifted uncomfortably. We are, honey. Just a few more things. Her eyes darted to the exits. When they reached the dairy section, I saw another woman with a cart full of groceries. She was younger, probably early 30s, talking frantically on her phone. I don't know, John. She was right here. I just turned around for a second to grab her juice. He knows not to wander off. No. She was wearing her favourite butterfly clip. The purple and silver one. Yes. And her yellow polka dot dress. My stomach dropped. The crying girl was wearing exactly that, a yellow polka dot dress and a butterfly hair clip, purple and silver, just like the one the younger woman was now Clutching in her free hand, I stepped closer to them, acting like I was reaching for milk. The girls next words confirmed everything Mommy had.

Alison couldn't let anyone else have their moment. At our cousin Jamie's beach wedding, she grabbed the mic during posts to announce her divorce. During our cousin Alex's first dance, she loudly told everyone at our table she was pregnant. At my best friend's reception, she stood on a chair during the cake cutting to reveal she was moving to Paris. That moment of chaos at her reception was nothing compared to what awaited me three months later at my wedding. Everything was going perfectly until the speeches started. My maid of honor was halfway through her beautiful toast when Alison stood up. She clinked her glass dramatically and walked to the front. She took the microphone right out of my friend's hand. Sorry, but I have something important to share while everyone's here. She announced, pulled her boyfriend, Craig up beside her. She told the entire room they were adopting a baby from Korea. My guest erupted in confused congratulations while my maid of honor stood there holding her speech cards uselessly. The rest of my reception became the Alison Show. People kept coming up to her for details about the adoption. Someone started a collection for baby supplies using the envelope box meant for our cards. The photographer spent 20 minutes doing an impromptu photo shoot of her and Craig. My mom found me crying in the bathroom and told Me? I was being dramatic. She just excited about becoming a mother. She said you should be happy for family. My aunt agreed that Alison was just enthusiastic about sharing good news. Two months later, at Sunday dinner, Alison announced her wedding date. She went on and on about her vintage Hollywood glamour theme. She'd already booked the historic Grandview Manor downtown. Craig sat there nodding while she showed everyone her Pinterest boards. I want it to be absolutely perfect, she gushed. No interruptions or distractions, just all eyes on us for once. The irony nearly choked me, but I smiled and said it sounded lovely. That night, I started planning. Allison's fatal flaw was her complete blindness to her own behavior. She genuinely believed she was just sharing joy. She couldn't understand why anyone would mind. She also had zero ability to handle competition for attention. I reached out to my college theater friends first. My roommate, Macy ran an improv group that specialized in flash mobs and public performances. When I explained my idea, she literally cackled delight. Within a week, I had 12 performers committed to the cause. The tricky part was getting them into the wedding. I studied Allison's guest list when she left it at my mom's house. Several couples had generic plus one RSVPs. Macy's performers could pose as dates for single guests. I knew. I reached out to these friends and explained the situation. Every single one wanted to help. After hearing about My wedding, the wedding was as over the top as expected. Allison had seven bridesmaids and released stubs during the ceremony. The reception ballroom dripped with crystals and white roses. My performers were scattered perfectly throughout the room as planned guests, everything started during dinner service. At exactly 6:30, Macy stood up at table four and let out a shriek. Her fake boyfriend was on one knee between the salad and soup courses. The whole room turned to watch as she said yes. He slipped a costume jewelry ring on her finger. Alison's smile froze, but she started clapping along with everyone else at 6:45 during the champagne toast.

My mom would go through my backpack every single day when I got home from school, checking my homework like I was in third grade. She'd read my text messages whenever she felt like it, and if I complained, she'd take my phone away for a week. My dad wasn't much better. He had this rule where I couldn't leave the house after six PM, even on weekends. If I wanted to hang out with friends, I had to give them a full essay about where I was going, who would be there, and when I'd be back. The final straw was when they installed one of those tracking apps on my phone without telling me. I only found out because my friend Jake mentioned seeing my location pop up when he was trying to text me. I confronted them about it that night, and my mom just shrugged and said it was for my safety. My dad backed her up, saying as long as I lived under their roof, I followed their rules. Been working at this pizza place since I turned 16, saving up every paycheck except for what I needed for gas and lunch money. By the time I graduated high school, I had almost $4,000 saved up. I started looking at apartments online during my lunch breaks, telling myself I was just browsing. But the More I thought about it, the more I realized I could actually do this. Found this tiny studio apartment about 20 minutes from my job. The rent was only 600 a month, and the landlord said if I could prove I had a steady income and pay first month plus deposit, he'd rent to me. I went to look at it on a day my parents thought I was at work. It was small and kind of dingy, but it was mine. I filled out the application that same day. Two weeks later, he called and said I was approved. I could move in the following weekend. That's when it hit me that I was actually doing this. I felt sick to my stomach, but also kind of excited. I started slowly moving my stuff out. Every day after work, I'd grab a backpack full of clothes or books and stash them in my car. I told my parents I was staying late to help close the restaurant, which wasn't totally a lie, since I was picking up extra shifts to make sure I could afford everything. The hardest part was getting my bigger stuff out. I waited until they went to my aunt's house for Sunday dinner, something I'd gotten out of by saying I had to work. I loaded up my car with my dresser, my desk, and my T V. Left most of the furniture since it wasn't really mine anyway. But I took the stuff that Mattered. I left them a note on the kitchen counter. I kept it simple. Told them I'd moved out, that I was safe, and that I'd call them in a few days when I was settled. I said I needed space to figure out who I was as an adult and that I hoped they'd understand eventually. I left my house key next to the note. My phone started blowing up around 8 that night. Missed calls, texts, voicemails. My mom was crying, and half of them, my dad was yelling in the others. They wanted to know where I was, if I was okay, why I didn't talk to them first. They said they'd always supported me and couldn't understand why I do this to them. I turned my phone off and didn't turn it back on until the next morning. I had 37 missed calls and way too many texts to read through. I called them back and told them I was fine. Gave them my address and said they could come see my place if they wanted. My mom showed up.

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he'd just say, what's next, Sir, one Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Because she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd

And it doesn't matter. Like, bro, real friends don't need to be in the same classroom or even the same postcode to stay tight. You could be across the city in a different uniform learning completely different subjects, but somehow the bond never fades. Everyone else is like, oh, if you don't go to the same school, you'll drift apart. Nah, bro, not us. I could be sitting in math class stressed out over equations I'll never use in life, and you're across town doing science experiments and we're still texting dumb memes like we saw each other five minutes ago. And when we do link up on the weekend, it's like we never left. No awkward vibes, no weird energy, just straight vibes, bro. We might not be in the same school, but we've got the same mindset, same humour, same jokes, same energy. And the best part, when you meet their school friends and suddenly you feel famous, like, oh, you're that friend they always talk about, yeah, that's me. I don't even go here, but I run this friendship. So if you've got a friend that's in another school but still feels closer than anyone in your class, appreciate that. That's real friendship. Forget proximity. It's about loyalty.

I used to fake sick at least once a month. Nothing dramatic, just your classic ugh, my stomach hurts routine.

My mom was already halfway out the door for work, so she just nodded and left. I grabbed a bowl of cereal, flopped on to the couch, and turned on some cartoons, already feeling like I'd won. Dad works nights, so he usually sleeps through most of the day and the house stays quiet, but around 10:00 I heard his door open. I muted the TV and listened. He walked past the living room without noticing me, phone in hand, and stepped out into the garage. Didn't think much of it at first, figured maybe he was calling in sick or trying to get a refund for something. But then I heard his voice through the wall. And it wasn't his normal voice. It was quiet, tired, flat. I can't do this anymore, he said. I paused. I Tried. I really tried. But I feel like I don't even know my family anymore. I come home and everything's just cold. I tiptoed down the hall, heart suddenly racing. The garage door was cracked open, just like always, and I crouched beside it. I know this isn't what we wanted, but it's where we are now, he said. Every day I feel like I'm just pretend ending. Pretending to be fine. Pretending to be a good husband, a good dad. My stomach twisted. This time for real. I mean, look at him, he said. He doesn't even like me. He doesn't talk to me unless he wants something. And when he does, it's just one word. Answers. I don't even know who he is anymore. My throat went dry. I look at him and all I can think is, what happened? What did I do wrong? When did he start looking at me like I was a stranger? There was silence then. I know it's awful, but sometimes I wonder if I'd be happier alone. Just starting over. Somewhere quiet. Somewhere nobody knows me. My chest felt like it caved in. I haven't said anything to her yet, he continued. I don't even know if I will. But I can't keep going like this. I'm exhausted. I backed away from the door before I could hear more. I stumbled into the bathroom and locked the door behind me. Sat on the edge of the and stared at the floor. He didn't know I was home. He didn't know I was listening. And he definitely didn't know I had just realized something I could never unhear. My dad didn't just feel lost. He felt lost because of me. I stayed in the bathroom for over an hour, just trying to breathe. When I finally came out, he was back in his room. I crept into mine, got under the covers, and didn't move for the rest the day. Later that night, he knocked on my door. How's your stomach? He asked. Fine. I mumbled. Need anything? No. He stood there for a second longer, then said, okay, let me know. I said nothing.

Of course I've slept with him. He's my boyfriend for three months. Oh my god. Are you kidding me right now? Oh my God. I can't believe, are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? I didn't even know he had a wife. So obviously, like I'm, I understand that you've been married for three years, but I'm hurting also because I had no idea that he was married to you and he's been acting like we are creating like, okay, but you know what I'm saying? Three months of casual dating is nothing compared to an actual marriage. Okay, I wasn't. Oh my goodness. Wait, listen, I wasn't. Okay. Does he take off his wedding ring every time you see him? Yeah, he girl, he has never been wearing a wedding ring ever. Like never, ever. And I wasn't trying to be disrespectful of your marriage. I had no idea that he was married. Like, so that's what I'm saying. So obviously it's not been casual dating in my opinion and in my eyes, we have been building something together. So forgive me for sleeping with your husband, but I had no idea that he was your husband. Do you feel me? Oh, man. Um, okay, well, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to forgive you, but obviously, like you said, I guess she didn't tell you. This is not necessarily your fault. I'm sure I hope that you wouldn't go Out of your way to sleep with a married man. But if you said that you don't know that he's married, I guess I don't really have any choice to believe you. So. Oh my God, I'm going to, I mean, I honestly wouldn't, I wouldn't go out of my way to sleep with a married man. But like, here's the, the fact of the matter is that I did, you know, and I do have feelings for Desmond. So I don't really know, like, I don't really know what to say right now. I'm feeling very overwhelmed. And I'm sorry, I don't, this is really totally, completely awkward and weird. But like, I don't know what's going on either. I have no idea. I'm, I just, I'm, I'm so, I'm shocked. I am, I'm so angry. I don't know what to do. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna, I can't, I can't believe this.

Last month I bought my first home after 13 years of grinding. My reward, a court summons from my own parents. The reason? That house should have been sages. I thought they were joking. They weren't. See, I've been living off ramen and working 60 hour weeks since college while my sister Sage got a full ride through life, art school, fancy apartment, everything handed to her. When she graduated with her 1 hundred eighty k art history degree, my parents promised her they'd help buy a house. Problem is, they're broke. Turns out funding Sage's lifestyle for 26 years drained their savings. when I finally scraped together enough for a down payment on a modest three bedroom, suddenly I became the villain. Their lawyer wanted me to transfer the house to my sister, pay off her mortgage, 50 k for emotional damages and write an apology for breaking up the family. I laughed so hard I snorted and hung up. The harassment started immediately. Mom posted on Facebook, some children forget where they came from. His sister has student loans and no stable housing. A good son would help his family. Disappointed. Now your family values, my aunt commented, shameful behavior. Your sister needs that house more than you need your selfishness. I got uninvited from Thanksgiving. The family group chat, cousins I hadn't talked to in years suddenly had opinions about my greed. My uncle called me Selfish for not stepping up when family needed help. Extended family members I barely knew were messaging me, telling me I was destroying the family and that I should do the right thing. Sage started posting Instagram stories about being betrayed by blood and how money changes people. He filmed herself crying outside my new house, talking about how she just wanted a place to call home. My parents escalated. Dad started parking outside my workplace, following me to the grocery store. Mom would show up at my gym, making scenes about how I was breaking her heart. They actually hired a private investigator to go through my finances trying to prove I somehow stole money or got help from someone. When that turned up nothing, they claimed I must have gotten an illegal loan. Court day arrives. My parents show up with Sage and my aunt, all wearing matching t shirts that said family comes first in giant letters. They brought a photographer to document their fight for justice. The drama started immediately. Sage rushed at me crying, I forgive you for pushing things this far. We can still fix this. I stepped back. She stumbled forward, arms grasping at air, putting on a perform for the courtroom. From the back row, my aunt muttered loud enough for everyone to hear, look at him turning his back on his own sister in her time of need. The judge banged his gavel for silence. Their lawyer clearly embarrassed to be There began presenting evidence, childhood Happy Meal receipts from 2003, a spreadsheet itemizing every birthday gift they'd ever bought me, including a 3 99 toy car from 1998, text messages where I said love you as proof of family obligation. They brought photo albums from when I was a baby, presenting them.

I was at my cousin Rachel's wedding reception when shit went completely sideways. The D J. Had just announced the father daughter dance. Everyone had their phones out ready to record, when this woman at table 12 starts talking loudly on her phone, not whispering, full volume, like she was alone in her living room. Yeah, I'm at some wedding. She. He's saying the decorations look like interest threw up. I'm only here because Mark works with the groom. My aunt Patricia, who'd spent eight months planning every detail and handmade 200 pascals a D per F lowers for the centerpieces, walks over with this forced smile. Real polite. She leans down and asks the woman to take the call outside. Woman, mid forties, wearing what looked like a sequin nightmare, pulls the phone away, looks Patricia dead in the eye, and goes, honey, I've been to nicer weddings at Applebee's. The music stops. Everyone's staring. Patricia's eye twitches. The woman continues into her phone. I'm serious, Sharon. These centerpieces look like dollar store clearance. And don't get me started on the bridesmaid dresses. That's when I noticed movement from table two. My 7 8 year old Grandma Dorothy was slowly standing up from her wheelchair. This woman, who complained for 20 minutes about her hip during the ceremony, was now moving with purpose. He adjusts her hearing aid, grabs her walker, and starts crossing the dance floor. The crowd parts like the Red Sea. Everyone knows Grandma Dorothy. She raised six kids during the depression and once made a door to door salesman cry just by looking at him. She taps the woman on the shoulder. The woman turns, phone and still pressed to her ear, looking annoyed. Grandma clears her throat and in her sweetest church voice says, sweetheart, I need to tell you something. Lady, I'm on the phone. Oh, I can see that. Grandma says still sugar sweet. I just wanted to let you know that I may be half blind, but even I can see you're built like a melted candle wearing a Party City wig. The woman's jaw drops. Someone gasps, my uncle starts recording. You're sitting here insulting my granddaughter's wedding while looking like you got dressed in the dark at Ross Dress for less! Those sequins aren't fooling anyone. We can all see your spanks are screaming for mercy. The woman finally hangs up, face going purple. How dare you! Grandma interrupts. Adults are talking. Well, one adult and whatever yard sale mannequin you are. Half the reception is now filming. The woman stands up, trying to tower over my five foot grandma. Listen here, you old bat! Old bat? Grandma chuckles. Honey, I've got any holes older than your marriage. Wait! She glances at the woman's bare ring finger. My mistake. Can't imagine why you're single. Someone at table 6 applauds. The woman grabs her knockoff purse. This is assault! I'll sue! For what? Telling the truth, I suppose if I looked like a clearance rack exploded on a scarecrow, I'd be sensitive, too. The woman storms toward

When I was 17, my mom forced me to start babysitting, but I had no idea who I was doing it for. When I met this woman, I couldn't believe how overprotective she was. She had cameras in every room of the house and asked me to call her every half hour just to make sure her daughter was okay. She told me I wasn't allowed to do anything except watch her. And when she finally left, I basically just sat there for three hours doing nothing until she came home. She came back and basically ran into the room to make sure the girl was okay and I assured her everything was fine. I had long hair at the time and had put it up at this point. And should probably now mention I have severe hearing loss. I have to wear hearing aids, which can usually be easily mistaken for headphones. Then as I was standing up to say bye to the girl, her mom noticed them in my ears. She thought I was wearing headphones the whole time and wasn't paying attention to the little girl. This made her furious and a second later, I felt her grab my head. All I remember was feeling the worst pain I've ever felt in my ear. I turned around to see her holding my hearing aid and realized what she did. She thought I was listening to music. She ripped my hearing aid. Out of my ear, thinking it was a headphone. And since they connect directly to my eardrum, she completely ripped that out, too. The pain was so intense I passed out and woke up in the hospital to my mom crying. She was livid. And even though they begged us not to, we sued her. I will never hear out of my ear again, but I'll never have to work again either.

I will take the house, kids, and everything. I stayed calm. Then I sent her an envelope. Now her lawyer is frantically calling mine. After 15 years of marriage, Megan stood in our kitchen and delivered her nuclear bomb. I'm not happy, Jeremy. Haven't been for years. And, yes, there's someone else. Been going on for a while. I just nodded, keeping my face neutral. Inside, my chest was caving in. Then came her smirk, pure arrogance that revealed who she really was. You'll never prove it. Keith is very careful. And even if you did, good luck. She puffed out her chest like she'd rehearse this. I'm taking the house. The kids will stay with me, obviously. And you'll be paying for all of it. You'll have nothing. Voice dripping contempt you think I haven't spoken to a lawyer? I know my rights. You're too soft, Jeremy. Always have been. I looked at her, really looked at the woman I'd loved, mother of Alice and Harold, and felt only. I see clarity. Okay, Megan, I said simply. Okay. Her smirk faltered. She'd expected yelling, tears. Instead, she got calm acceptance. For two weeks, she acted like she'd already won, telling our kids, you'll be with mommy. Mostly while serving me divorce papers demanding full custody, house, my car, and crushing alimony. Her shark lawyer clearly thought this would be easy prey. Megan believed she held all the cards. She was wrong. What she didn't know was that I'd hired a private investigator the moment she admitted the affair. While she felt smug and invincible, I was methodically building a case that would destroy every Assumption she'd made. The PI documented everything. Hotel receipts, their dates, intimate photos of Megan and key. All paid for with her credit card, funded by salary earned during our marriage, making it marital property she was squandering. But the evidence got even better. Megan had used her company email for the affair, detailing how she'd take Jeremy to the cleaners, how he was too stupid to see it coming, and how she'd make sure the kids understood the divorce was his fault. The best part came from my friend Andrea. During lunch, after two glasses of wine, Megan got loose lipped about her exit strategy. How she'd cry for the judge, paint me as emotionally distant, and how Keith thought her shark behavior was hot. Andrea recorded the whole conversation.

My older sister Emma has cerebral palsy, and my parents have spent my entire life making me pay for being the normal one. Growing up, every family dinner was about Emma's achievement. She got a B+ despite her challenge, while you only got an A. Every birthday, half my presents went to Emma so she wouldn't feel left out. When I made varsity soccer, her dad said, just remember, Emma will never get to run like that. I became the family ATM at 14. My summer job money went to Emma's therapy. My babysitting cash funded her special equipment. When other kids bought video games, I was buying Emma's medications. My friends got cars for their 16 birthdays. I got a lecture about privilege and responsibility. The worst part? Everyone praised my parents for raising such a selfless son. Teachers would gush about how mature I was. Neighbors called me an inspiration. Church members held us up as the perfect Christian family. I smiled and nodded while dying inside, wondering what I'd done wrong to deserve this life. My guidance counselor pulled me aside junior year. Jake, your grades are incredible. Have you thought about applying to top universities? I laughed bitterly. With what money? She looked confused, so I explained that every penny I'd ever earned went to Emma's care. When I got accepted to Stanford with a partial scholarship, mom sat me down with tears in Her eyes. We're so proud of you, she said. But we can't afford the rest. Emma needs a new wheelchair, and her therapy costs just went up again. My college fund, 18 years of birthday money, graduation gifts, everything had vanished into Emma's medical expenses without anyone asking me. I watched my dreams crumble while my parents acted like they were making a noble sacrifice. I was 22, working two dead end jobs to afford community college, living in my childhood bedroom decorated with part disappointment trophies I'd won before I Learned winning meant nothing in our house. Emma called me, sobbing one night. I need to tell you something, she whispered. Can we meet tomorrow? We sat in a coffee shop where she pulled out her phone with shaking hands. I recorded mom and dad last night. You need to hear this. The audio destroyed me. Mom's voice we've been too hard on Jake. Using Emma as an excuse to control his life isn't fair to either of them, dad replied. He's strong, though. He'll figure it out. Besides, Emma actually told me she feels guilty about the college money. She never asked for any of this attention, but we made it seem like she needed everything. Mom continued, when really, we just couldn't say no to her requests and yes to his dreams. We turned him into her caretaker instead of her brother. The worst part is how proud everyone thinks we are. Dad sighed. When really, we Just took the easy path. It's easier to sacrifice Jake's future than fight insurance companies. My sister looked at me with tears streaming down her face. Jake, I never asked them to take your college fund. I begged them not to. When I found out last year, they said you'd understand because you're the responsible one who always

Look, I never thought I'd be the type of person to have a screaming match in a hospital parking lot, but here we are. My husband Jake and I have been together for six years, married for four, and this was our first real fight that made me question everything. 33 weeks pregnant right now, and at 20 weeks, my doctor told me I have something called placenta previa. Basically, my placenta is blocking the opening where the baby needs to come out. They said it might move as the baby grows, but mine never did. So I'm scheduled for a C section in three weeks. The whole thing started getting real at 30 weeks, when my doctor put me on strict restrictions. No running, no lifting anything over 10 pounds, no standing for more than three hours, and absolutely no sex or anything going near that area. She was super clear. Any bleeding could trigger preterm labour and put both me and the baby at risk. Jake has been losing his mind over the no sex rule every single day. He'd bring it up every morning while I'm trying to eat my cereal without throwing up. He's making comments. When I'm trying to watch TV after work with my feet up because they're swollen like balloons, he's rubbing my shoulders, but really, he's just working up to asking again. I kept explaining the doctor's Orders. But he'd roll his eyes and say stuff like, you're not made of glass or, doctors are so paranoid these days. I'm exhausted all the time. My back hurts, I can barely see my feet, and honestly, sex is the last thing on my mind. Anyway, three days ago, he came into our bedroom while I was folding tiny baby clothes and started this whole speech about how doctors exaggerate things for money and push unnecessary C sections. He said my doctor was being dramatic and that one time wouldn't hurt anything. I tried to explain again about the bleeding risk, but he kept pushing. I was tired of fighting about about it every single day. Part of me just wanted him to stop asking. And I guess I convinced myself that maybe he was right and the doctor was being overly cautious. So we had sex. About two hours later. I went to the bathroom, and there was so much blood, I thought I was dying. I'm talking bright red blood just pouring out of me. I started shaking and crying, thinking I was about to lose our baby at 33 weeks. I called my doctor's emergency line while Jake was in the living room watching some stupid action movie. She told me to come to the hospital immediately. The whole 20 minute drive, there I was, sobbing, imagining holding a tiny premature baby who might not make it. Jake kept trying to hold my hand and saying, Probably nothing. But I could see he was scared, too. His face was completely white, and he kept gripping the steering wheel. When we got to the hospital, they hooked me up to monitors right away. The baby's heartbeat was strong, and after what felt like hours, the doctor said I wasn't in labor. The bleeding had stopped, and everything looked okay. But it was definitely caused by the sex. That's when my doctor asked Jake to step outside. She started.

I understand that you've been married for three years, but I'm hurting also because I had no idea that he was married to you, and he's been acting like we are creating. Okay, but you know what I'm saying. Three months of casual dating is nothing compared to an actual marriage. No, no, no. Okay, I wasn't. Oh, my goodness. Wait, listen. I wasn't. Okay, does he take off his wedding ring every time you see him? Yeah, he. Girl, he has never been wearing a wedding ring ever. Like, never ever. And I wasn't trying to be disrespectful. Oh, my. Of your marriage. I had no idea that he was married. Like, so. That's what I'm saying. So obviously, it's not been casual dating.

Okay, well, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to forgive you, but obviously, like you said, I guess she didn't tell you. This is not necessarily your fault. I'm sure. I hope That you wouldn't go out of your way to sleep with a married man. But if you said that you don't know that he's married, I guess I don't really have any choice to believe you, so. Oh, my god.

Her name is Kelly. Okay. Okay. Kelly's a hot girl name. Mm hmm. Yeah, that's. That's what I always think, anyway. And so she works out, like, all the time. She's, like, really in shape and all that stuff. Okay. Is that something you talked to her about, or you just assume we. Because we. We talked a little bit about that. You know, she never eats sugar, never eats bread, and, um, she's always strict about her diet. I get that. I mean, I'm not quite as good. To look amazing, those are the things that you have to sacrifice. That's why I've never been willing to do it. Take all the fun out of your life. Yeah. So we hung out, went out to dinner, and I even got the, you know, the cauliflower appetizer. We had sushi. You were trying to lead into her lifestyle, so less carbs today. Yeah. Yeah, I was all in on it, you know? And then we went over to. We went bowling over at Cosmic Balls, you know, and they got the neon lights and the loud music, you know, we were having, like, a good time. Balls are. That is a good. And that's where you can, like, order some mozzarella sticks for yourself on the side and eat them over, like, the bathroom where she can't see you. Tell him, hey, leave them over on the stall. Too on the stall. But the thing is, the bowling, it ends like at 11:00. And I was like, I thought the date went well. And I was thinking, we just call it a night, okay. But out of nowhere, she was like, hey, like, what are we gonna do now? Oh, I love it. Like she wants to keep going. Yeah. I'm thinking, wait a minute, that's a fastball. Belt buckle. So I just said, fastball, belt buckle. Is she a little bit in the eyes and knock it out of the park, guys. Oh, I thought he said belt. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, belt. That's like the perfect place to hit a ball. It's a sweet spot. Alright, it's a layup. Are you a little bit older than Kelly? No. Well, I think I have a couple years on her, but not that much. Okay, but girls say like, what are we doing now? After a date? Yeah, after we're having a good time. You like dinner and a date? Well, I just said, well, you know, you want to come over? Yeah, yeah, okay. But you know, she needed to get coffee first. So we just went to one of those gas stations and got some coffee and. Oh, gas station coffee. You couldn't wait to Starbucks? That's open 24 hours. She suffered from heartburn the rest of the evening. It's not easy to get a coffee. I guess at 11:30 it is. If you know the Prices, yeah. Yeah, but not all, like, Starbucks or whatever. I mean, maybe that's not even a thing. Like, was it. Was she fine with that? It's not like we're in Miami in the 80s.

Uh, I don't know who this is. Oh, you don't? That's what I just said. What? What is this? My my name is Jubal. I'm calling from brick and Jubal in the morning, the radio show. And I'm calling you because you recently went out on a date with one of our listeners and they were hoping that we could get a hold of you. Why is a radio show calling me about a date? Well, we do a segment on our show called The 2nd Date Update. So you recently went out on a date with a girl named Jenna. Yeah. Okay. And so Jenna emailed us because you haven't been answering any of her phone calls and she thought you guys had a great time, but she's wondering if she did something wrong or if there was a specific reason that you're not calling her back. No, there's nothing specific. Just, you know, not digging to going through with things that you know There's no point to so you feel like there's no point in continuing to try to date Jenna? I mean, I just know that it's not gonna work let me ask you this was it because she dressed too conservatively right? Please. I know that's annoying. No, that had nothing to do with it. Okay. Well, she was she was actually concerned that that might be the issue. No, that's that's that's not the reason why well, if that's not the reason why can you kind of give us a little bit of information so that at least I can tell her hey, don't worry about the way that you dress it wasn't that yeah, you can tell her that that's fine but I mean, as far as like a more specific thing it's just kind of like one of those things where it's not gonna work and really to be honest, she's cute and everything but I'm looking for a different breed of girl a different breed. What does that even mean? We're not breed like we don't come like thoroughbred or no, there are some thoroughbreds out there and there are some definite runs believe me. I know I know what you're talking about Scott. Yeah, I mean, there are some breeds of all kinds of humans. Thank you. But what are you looking for then? You know, basically I'm a guy who works a lot pretty successful at what I do and you know is she not Pretty enough? No, she's fine. She's very cute. I'm not saying that the bottom line is that like, I don't know how to say this, but she's too smart. What you said too? Did you just say too smart? Yeah, too smart. Yeah, that's right. She is too smart. I'm not looking for, um, a smart girl. What you want for, um, a smart girl what you want that might be the, that might be the best way to be turned down for a date ever is for somebody to tell you that you're too smart. That's like a compliment, but then also a let down at the same time. Why? What? What do you mean you, you only date dumb girls? Well, I mean, I wouldn't say that. Um, I just want someone who is not as smart and someone who's not as ambitious as Jenna is. Why would you not? I, I, I feel like I look for the opposite and I've never had the opposite. So I've had the other thing and trust me, it's not all that's cracked up to be, but I feel like I want the opposite and and why would you want to be with someone who's not ambitious and not smart? Well, like I said, I'm pretty successful and, um, I need someone who's just gonna focus on me and not their own career or their own motivation. Oh my God. Oh, so cool. So you just want someone to be home And look pretty for you and make you some dinner every once in a while. You know, I'm a good looking guy. I do really well. Basically, I just been looking for some arm candy. And there's nothing wrong with that. Well, there is because you're treating your woman as a trophy no matter who she is. So there's lots of things wrong with that. There is a ton of benefits, okay. She gets to go on a lot of great vacation, a lot of business trip.

But my daughter did something that made him turn pale. It was Thanksgiving at his parents house and I should have known better than to show up with store bought dinner rolls. For eight years of marriage to Derek, I had Learned that everything had to be perfect in front of his family or there would be consequences later. But I had been pulling 12 hour shifts at the hospital all week and barely had time to shower, let alone bake homemade bread. His mother, Patricia, made the first comment. As I set the plastic container on her perfectly set dining table, she lifted one roll with her manicured fingers like it might contaminate her entire meal. Well, she said, loud enough for the entire room to hear, I suppose not everyone has time for family traditions anymore. Twenty two family members were crammed into that dining room. His parents, both brothers with their wives, six kids ranging from toddlers to teenagers, and various aunts and uncles who had been in from neighboring towns. All of them turned to stare at me like I had committed some unforgivable sin. I forced a smile and explained that I had been working overtime at the hospital. Three nurses had called in sick with the flu and someone had to cover the emergency department. I thought they would understand. His father was a retired police officer. His brothers worked construction. They knew about demanding jobs. But Derek's face was already turning that familiar shade of red that meant trouble was coming. His jaw clenched the way it always did when he thought I had embarrassed him. The vein in his temple started throbbing. You always have an excuse, he said loudly enough to cut through every conversation in the room. The football game on TV suddenly seemed too loud. Someone's fork clinked against their plate. One of the toddlers asked for more juice, but nobody moved to help him. All eyes were on us. Now. I'm not making excuses, I said as calmly as I could manage. I'm explaining why I didn't have time to bake this week. That's when he hit me. The slap echoed through the dining room like a gunshot. My cheek exploded in pain, and I could taste blood where my teeth had cut the inside of my lip. The force of it knocked me sideways, and I had to grab the back of a chair to keep from falling. Complete silence fell over the room. Not one person moved. Not one person spoke. His father stared at his plate like it held the secrets of the universe. His mother suddenly developed an intense interest in folding and refolding her napkin. His brothers exchanged a quick glance, but immediately looked away. Even the children had gone completely quiet. Don't you ever embarrass me like that again! Derek hissed through clenched teeth. That's When my 16 year old daughter Chloe stood up from the kids table in the corner. She had been living with us for two years since her father died in a motorcycle accident. Derek had never liked her, always complained that she was too mouthy, too independent, too much like me for his taste. She walked over slowly, deliberately pulling her phone out of her back pocket as she moved. When she reached where Derek was standing, she held it up and aimed it directly at his face. Smile, she said with the sweetest voice imaginable. You're about to become very famous. Derek's angry red face drained to white so fast I thought he might pass out. His hands, which had been clenched into fists, started shaking. What the hell are you talking about? He demanded. I've been recording everything for the last hour, Chloe announced to the entire room. Every nasty comment, every threat, every single slap. And guess what, Uncle Derek? It's already uploaded to three different cloud servers. She turned to face his entire family, who were now staring at her like she'd grown a second head. Did you all know that in this state, witnessing domestic violence and failing to report it when children

My first few months as a 9 1 1 operator were scary, but nothing could have prepared me for when I got a call late at night from a young girl. I could barely understand what she was saying through her sobbing, but she told me she had just swallowed an entire bottle of pills and just wanted someone to talk to before they did anything. I started asking her why she would do that and asked for her address. She thought I already had it. But after a few minutes, she finally told me where she lived. She said she was severely depressed and just wanted everything to end. I asked her why, just trying to keep her on the phone and she said she couldn't take the hate she was getting anymore. I knew I only had literal minutes to do something and tried talking her into throwing up. She told me no. So I asked her what kind of hate she was getting. Apparently, she just wanted people to like her and wanted to help people. She was getting a lot of hate comments on TikTok and even people in real life. Then it all clicked. I knew I recognized her voice and I actually knew who she was. After a few minutes, I asked her if she was who I thought and she was really surprised. I started to tell her how one of her Videos actually changed my life and got me out of a toxic relationship. She knew I wasn't lying because I told her all about it. I asked her one more time and she finally agreed to try and make herself throw up. She was unconscious when the paramedics got there, but because of that, she was still alive. She now has millions of followers and I'm glad to see her much happier today.

I thought Doctor Martinez had seen everything, 23 years of experience, wrote the textbook on emotional regulation, had a waiting list longer than a CVS receipt. His office wall was covered in certificates, including one from the Dalai Lama. I was there because I'd gotten into a fist fight with a mall Santa. Not my proudest moment. Anger, Doctor Martinez said during our first session, is like holding a hot coal. You're only burning yourself. He had this perfectly calibrated therapist voice like NPR merged with a yoga instructor. Behind him sat a collection of stress balls shaped like world leaders heads. I noticed Nixon was particularly worn out. Session one was textbook. We explored my triggers, discussed coping strategies. He gave me a worksheet about identifying emotions. I pretended to care. He pretended to believe me. We were both professionals at this dance. Session 3, I mentioned my coworker Brad. Brad replies all to every email, even the automated ones. Brad clips his toenails at his desk. Brad pronounces it expresso and corrects others who say it right. Doctor Martinez's left eye twitched just once. Brad sounds challenging, he said, squeezing Stalin's head. Session 5 changed everything. I was ranting about my gym. They play the same Ed Sheeran song on repeat for three months. The same song. Doctor Martinez set down his notepad. Which song? Thinking out loud, he went pale. My gym plays shape of You four months, I've counted 847 times. By session seven, we'd abandoned all pretenses. He for us both coffee and we just vent. His mother in law moved in and rearranged his entire house while he was at work. My HOA, find me for my grass being 0.5 inches too tall. He got a parking ticket. While contesting a different parking ticket, I found out my ex was dating my dentist. Session 9, he told me about his colleague, Doctor Peterson. He steals my yogurt every day, writes his name on my yogurt, says he's conducting a social experiment on possession and ownership. I have a pee HD from Harvard. I don't need his experiments. I need my strawberry yo plate. Session 11 was when the universe chose violence. I walked in to find him on the phone. White knuckle Churchill ceramic head. What do you mean the insurance doesn't cover therapy for therapists? I am the therapy. He hung up, looked at me. My therapist just fired me. Said I was too negative. M E. I teach positivity seminars. Then his phone buzzed, a text from his teenage daughter. Dad, I'm dropping out to be an influencer. Also, I crashed your car into a subway. The restaurant, not the train. Something in his eyes changed like watching a documentary about damn failures. First a crack, then a trickle, then you know what? He stood up eerily calm. Buddha was wrong. Nisha was wrong. Young Freud, all of them wrong. He picked up his stress ball collection. Some people just need to be punched. Some situations don't have a breathing exercise sometimes. He launched Nixon at his diploma. The only path to inner peace is accepting that everyone else is the problem. He opened his window, started throwing everything out. Books, certificates, the meditation fountain that never worked anyway. Twenty three years of breathe and count to 10. You know what? I've been counting to 10 my whole life. I'm at like 84 million by now. His secretary knocked. Doctor Martinez, your three o'clock is here. Tell them to breathe and count to 10, he screamed, launching Roosevelt out the window. Security.

Your daughter drew this during free time, she said, sliding a picture across the desk. It was a woman lying in red, a car on its side, a date written in crayon, November 14. That's my sister, the teacher whispered. That's Jennifer. She's borrowing my car this weekend for a trip. I felt ice in my veins. The date was November 14, three days away. Mia says Jennifer shouldn't go. She says. She says the road will be angry. I didn't know what to do. Do you call someone and say my five year old had a premonition about your death? But the teacher begged me. She canceled her sister's trip, made up an excuse about family emergency. November 14th came and went. Nothing happened. I felt ridiculous. Maybe everyone was right. Maybe Mia was just an anxious kid with an overactive imagination. Then we saw the news. On Highway 17, the exact route Jennifer would have taken, a massive pile up, five cars, three fatalities, black ice. At eleven forty three PM one of the cars matched the exact make and model of the teacher's car. My daughter saved someone who didn't even get in the vehicle. Last week, Mia came to me crying, Mama, I'm scared. I keep seeing you lying down and you won't wake up and daddy's crying. I've had this headache for months. Keep ignoring it. Too busy, too expensive to see doctors for every little thing. But my daughter has never been Wrong. I have an MRI scheduled for tomorrow. I'm terrified of what they'll find. I'm more terrified of what would happen if I didn't listen. My child isn't different. She's a warning system in a world that doesn't want to hear warnings. And God help me, I don't know if her gift will save me or if she's been preparing me for something I can't stop.

Joshua's smirk vanished. Mom looked slapped. Dad's face turned red. Before we talk about contributions, I want everyone to understand why we won't be participating. We've been excluded from birthdays, vacations, Christmas. That stops tonight. I pulled out my business card, listing me as owner. I don't need your money. I don't need your fund. I don't need anything from you except distance. I stood. You wanted me to set the tone. Consider it set. I walked out, leaving the papers behind. The next morning, my phone exploded. Mom called. I can't believe you embarrassed us. Didn't embarrass you. I just showed everyone what you've been hiding. You didn't have to do it in front of everyone. Yes, I did. If I said it privately, you'd have brushed it off. Over the next weeks, relatives reached out. An aunt admitted she'd been biting her tongue for years. A cousin apologized for never inviting my kids. Three weeks later, mom and dad showed up at my shop. We didn't realize how bad it had gotten. Mom said softly, if you want to Be part of their lives. It has to be on equal terms. No more secret parties, no special treatment. Mom nodded slow. We'll try that weekend. The group chat pinged. Dinner Sunday, everyone invited. When we arrived, there were four gift bags by the door. Two with Joshua's kids names, two with mine. Madeline's face lit up when she saw hers. Watching my kids laugh and feel included for the first time in years, I realized this was what I've been fighting for all along.

Auntie Jen's brain is fuzzy and the car will go boom. My sister laughed it off, said Mia was being silly. That weekend, Jen totaled her car, driving under the influence. Walked away with barely a scratch, but the car was destroyed. Boom! At the grocery store, Mia grabbed a stranger's hand. An old man, probably 70, buying cat food alone. Don't do it tonight, Mister, she whispered. The angels aren't ready yet. He stared at her, went pale, and rushed out. I apologized to him, but he was already gone. That night, the police called me. The man had contact to them. Said a little girl at the store had saved his life. He'd planned to end things that evening, had the pills in his car. But something my daughter said made him call a crisis line instead. The site chiropractor said she had heightened anxiety and hypervigilance, possibly from trauma. But Mia had no trauma. We'd given her the safest, most loving childhood possible. The psychologist said she was exceptionally intuitive and might be reading micro expressions subconsciously.

That's my sister, the teacher whispered. That's Jennifer. She's borrowing my car this week.

I knew something was wrong with my daughter Mia when she was two and a half. Not different. Wrong. We were at her pediatrician for a routine check up. Doctor Harrison had been our doctor since Mia was born. Always smiling, always patient. But that day, when he walked in, Mia started screaming. Not crying. Screaming like she was being murdered. No, don't let him touch me! He hurts the little ones. I was mortified. Doctor Harrison looked shocked, but tried to approach her gently. Mia threw herself on the floor, hyperventilating, pointing at him. His hands are red. His hands are red. We left immediately. I apologized profusely. He said children sometimes react strangely to doctors. But Mia had never done this before. Not with him, not with anyone. Three weeks later, Doctor Harrison was arrested. They found thousands of images on his computer. He'd been abusing patients for years. The youngest was 18 months old. I threw up when I saw the news. My husband held me while I sobbed. How did she know? How could she possibly know? After that, I started watching. Really watching. Mia refused to go to her best friend's house anymore. Just cried and said, the air is sticky there. Two months later, we found out Emma's father had been trafficking drugs from their garage. The police raid was on every local channel. She wouldn't let my sister babysit. Auntie Jen's brain is fuzzy. And the car will go boom. My sister laughed it off. Said Mia was being silly. That weekend, Jen totaled her car driving under the influence. Walked away with barely a scratch, but the car was destroyed. Boom! At the grocery store, Mia grabbed a stranger's hand. An old man, probably 75

She suddenly became possessive. My girlfriend made me change out of the festive sweater I knitted for her work's holiday party because she said everyone would know it was homemade and her coworkers were fashion people who notice things like that. I wore my black henley instead and watched her abandon me the second we entered the apartment to air kiss her marketing team by the gold balloon arch while I stood alone, hanging both our coats in the closet like her personal assistant. Within five minutes, she was posing for Instagram Stories, and I was standing by the kitchen island arranging crackers on my tiny plate and pretending anyone else at this party might acknowledge my existence. Oh, my god, that sweater is absolutely insane. A woman with purple highlights practically materialized beside me, staring at my clothes. I look down at my plain black shirt, confused, until she pointed at the Fair Isle cardigan draped over my arm that I knitted for my girlfriend and hoped she'd wear to the party. Did you seriously make this yourself? Because I'm going to lose my mind if you did. Before I could answer, she was already touching the sleeve and examining the pattern up close. The colors blend together like an actual sunset. And these stitches are so perfect, they look machine made. But she held it up to the Light and gasped. Wait. Are these your girlfriend's initials worked into the pattern? That's the most romantic thing I've ever seen. My stomach dropped because, yes, those were her initials hidden in the color work, and she'd never even noticed them. Your girlfriend must die every time you make her something. This beautiful woman was already putting the cardigan on over her dress. I need you to understand that I would wear this every single day until I died. Something in my chest unclenched for the first time in months because finally, someone actually saw what I'd create.

Then Scarlet got engaged to a wealthy real estate developer, and suddenly our arrangement wasn't optimal. Suddenly, I was too aggressive to raise a daughter.

I aggressively confronted a teenager who pushed Maddie off a swing. And I had concerning military memorabilia. My grandfather's Purple Heart from Korea. I hired a family lawyer who warned me family court could be unpredictable. We gathered documentation, calendars, photos of activities, testimonials from Maddie's teachers. Then things got strange.

She ordered Maddie temporarily placed with my parents. Mr. Harrison, she addressed me directly. Please provide that recording to the clerk immediately. The emergency hearing was brief. Based on the voicemail, the fabricated medical records and the Epipen incident, the judge granted me temporary full custody. Scarlet was given supervised visitation pending psychological evaluation. Her new lawyer tried arguing the voicemail was taken out of context. Threatening a child for potentially failing to lie in a court proceeding is not something this court takes lightly, the judge said. Nor is fabricating medical condition at evening. I picked Up Maddie from my parents house. Am I staying with you now? She asked. For a while, yes. Is that okay with you? She nodded, looking out the window. Mom gets really mad sometimes. She says it's because of me. I have primary custody and Maddie is safe.

He was dating Owen, our starting quarterback, and they've been together since sophomore year. Help me, please. Get someone! She gasped, and I'd never run so fast in my life. I didn't know who to get. I couldn't see a single girl in sight, so I grabbed the next best person. Our coach took one look at Jenna, and his eyes went wide. Under the stadium lights. Jenna kept, and it's too early. It's not supposed to happen yet. Which didn't make any sense, because what was too early? Our coach started freaking out. Before telling me to stay with Jenna, he went and grabbed one of our team Justis, Mrs. Pruitt, from the stands. And as I kneeled next to her, I asked what was wrong. She was holding her stomach. And then it hit me. Jenna was having a baby. Right here. During homecoming. The crowd was starting to notice something was wrong because we'd formed this weird huddle behind the bench. The referees were blowing their whistles, wondering why half our team wasn't on the field. Owen came jogging over in his quarterback year, asking what was wrong with his girlfriend, and Jenna grabbed my hand so hard, I thought she'd break it. Don't let him see. You can't let him see the baby, she whispered to me. But Owen was already trying to get there. Everyone in the stands were freaking out over what was happening, and every

Court day came, and Haley walked in wearing designer dress and heels, holding the dentist's hand and actually laughing about something. Then she saw me sitting at Ryan's table, organizing evidence. Her smile completely vanished. She grabbed her lawyer frantically, but there was nothing she could do. The judge had already started. For the first hour, Haley's lawyer painted Ryan as controlling and manipulative. He claimed Ryan forced her into an inappropriate relationship. Then we presented our evidence. 60 pages of proof. The daycare teacher testified that Ryan knew everything about his daughter, including her favorite toy, her allergies, her exact bedtime routine. Haley didn't even know her daughter's teacher's name. The pediatrician confirmed Ryan never missed one appointment, while Haley had been to exactly zero. Her own Instagram became evidence against her, showing her partying while Ryan was home doing bedtime. During recess, Haley cornered me in the Bathroom with mascara running down her face. She said, you're destroying me because he chose me. I dried my hand slowly and told her, I'm showing the court who actually raises that little girl. The judge gave Ryan primary custody, and Haley only got supervised weekends. Outside court. Ryan thanked me and said leaving me was his biggest mistake. I told him it was the best thing that happened to me. Two months later, he texted me that the dentist had left Haley. She tried the same manipulation story on him.

When they opened the wall, accumulated water released, causing major damage to both units. Building declared both apartments uninhabitable for three to four weeks. I didn't cause the leak. It was genuine maintenance. But the timing was perfect. She calls that evening. Where am I supposed to go? I hear Kyle has a nice place. You know about everything. Security cameras.

Dinner at an upscale place, inviting our closest friends. The day before, she casually mentioned. Oh, by the way, I invited Kyle, too. Kyle? Your ex? Yeah. Is that okay? He's just a friend now. Something felt off, but I didn't want to seem insecure. Sure, whatever. The night arrived. Table for eight at this beautiful restaurant. We're having drinks, waiting on Kyle. He shows up 20 minutes late with purple dahlias. Eliza's beaming. Kyle hands her the flowers, completely ignoring me. These are for you. He Says, happy spring. It's October. Eliza accepts them, face lighting up purple dahlias. It's sweet that you still remember what I like. The table goes silent. Everyone's looking, from Kyle to Eliza, to me. Kyle finally acknowledges me with a nod. Happy birthday, man. No flowers for the birthday boy. Dinner proceeds like I'm invisible. Kyle dominates conversation, sharing inside jokes with Eliza. He's positioned directly across from her, making constant eye contact. I'm supposedly the guest of honor, but might as well be a ghost. The

You're too embarrassing. I replied, understood. Then I showed up to her elite country club as the owner's son. When she saw me shaking hands with her friends. Victoria and I had been together three years, engaged for six months. She recently got accepted into this exclusive country club through her boss's sponsorship. Everything changed when she got in. Suddenly, every weekend was about the club. Tennis, charity lunches, wine tastings. Then came the conversation that ended everything. Last Tuesday, she was getting ready for some gala. I asked, when do I get to meet these new friends? She stopped applying makeup and gave me this look. Daniel, these people are different. They're refined. They discuss investments and art, not carburetors and fishing. You'd be uncomfortable, and frankly, you'd embarrass me. Your job, your hobbies, your too blue collar for that environment. I stared at her. Three years together, living in my house, wearing the ring I bought, and I'm too embarrassing. Understood? I said. After she left, I made a phone call I've been avoiding for two years. Here's what Victoria didn't know. That country club she was so proud of joining. My father built it from scratch in 1987. When he. He died five years ago, he left it to me and my sister Eleanor. I never mentioned it because I wanted nothing to do with it. Dad thought I was wasting my life being a mechanic. Instead of wearing a suit, Eleanor runs the business side. I'm a silent partner who just signs papers once a year. After Victoria's speech, I called Eleanor. I need to visit the club Saturday. There's a charity auction, right? You haven't set foot there since Dad's funeral. Is this about that woman you're seeing? Eleanor handles membership approval.

I thought I was doing everything right after my husband died. Making pancakes shaped like dinosaurs, never missing a soccer practice, smiling through parent teacher conferences while my chest felt like it was caving in. My daughter Ava, was only 3 when the accident happened. She was too young to really understand that her dad wasn't coming back from his work trip. I kept telling myself I had to be strong for her. That's what good moms do, right? They hold it together. They don't fall apart in front of their kids. So I cried in the shower. I cried in my car before picking her up from daycare. I cried into my pillow at two in the morning. But never in front of Ava. Never where she could see the cracks forming. For eight months, I played this role. The happy mom. The one who had everything under control. I packed her lunch with little notes inside. I took her to the park every Saturday. I read her three books before bed, even when I was so exhausted I could barely see straight. Everyone kept telling me how strong I was. Well, I was handling everything. I started believing it, too. Maybe I was fine. Maybe I really could just push through this and come out the other side without falling apart. Then one Tuesday afternoon, I was folding laundry in the living room. Just A normal day. Ava was playing in her room. I had the news on in the background, not really paying attention. Just noise to fill the silence. Then they started talking about a hit and run that happened downtown. Before I could grab the remote, they showed a photo of the accident scene. A car completely destroyed. Metal twisted everywhere. Glass scattered across the pavement. My hands froze midfold. The shirt

I'm in love with Haley, his stepsister. Everyone just sat there, frozen. They walked out together while I stood there in my dress feeling like I couldn't breathe. But that wasn't even the worst part. I had to call 70 guests myself, explaining why the wedding was off. The next day, they posted photos together online like it was some great love story. Our friends actually took their side. Then I found out they've been sneaking around for months behind my back while I was picking wedding flowers. They were meeting in secret. I felt so stupid. I packed up everything and left for law school, where I basically lived in the library. No friends, no dating. Just textbooks and this burning anger that kept me going. I specialised in family law. I wanted to understand exactly what makes someone an unfit parent and how to prove it in court. First year, I was sleeping four hours a night. Second year, I was top of my class. Third year, three different firms were fighting to hire me. Meanwhile, Ryan and Haley had a baby and their lives were falling apart. Their parents completely cut them off. They went from posting fancy dinner photos to selling their furniture on Facebook, lost their apartment and had to move in with roommates, both working minimum wage. I took the best firm and became their star researcher. Won 17 custody cases. My first Year. Never thought I'd see them again. Until my boss called me in one morning about a new client. He told me the client specifically asked for our firm. I walked into the conference room ready to meet this new client. There was this exhausted looking man in a wrinkled shirt facing away from me.

After one kid got caught using chat GPT on an essay, Principal Tyrell implemented the most extreme policy our district had ever seen. Our school became a complete dead zone. No phones, no smartwatches, no tablets, nothing with a screen allowed past the front gates. Security guards stormed into my algebra class with metal detectors, making everyone empty their pockets and bags onto their desks. Confiscated everything. Even calculators got locked up until math class. One girl's insulin monitor got taken until her parents threatened to sue. Teachers had to switch back to paper attendance sheets. That took forever. The nurse started writing medical information on index cards that got mixed up constantly. Our computer lab got padlocked shut. The worst part was lunch. We used to show each other videos and memes and be iPad babies. Now we sat there in weird silence. It started bringing the most random stuff, like UNO cards and paper fortune tellers from elementary school. What if there's an emergency? He actually laughed. That's what we have landlines for. Every classroom has one. Then he launched into his favorite speech about how his generation survived just fine without phones. The teachers behind him looked miserable. Mrs. Olson kept fidget checking her empty wrist where her Apple Watch used to be. Joyce was carrying around this ancient walkie talkie from the nineties that barely worked. My parents thought it Was brilliant. Finally, a principal who gets it. That's when Mario came in clutch. Mario was our janitor, but he used to work it before the school laid off half the tech apartment. He thought Terrell's rule was completely insane. During one of my bathroom breaks, he pulled me aside near the maintenance closet. Kid, this is dangerous, he said, looking around nervously. What if something real happens? He pulled out an old phone from his tool belt. They check teachers bags every morning, but nobody ever searches the janitor, he said with a bitter laugh.

He confirmed I could withdraw without penalty as long as Claire Hadn't deposited her portion yet when she announced the prenup ambush.

Maybe at his age, his body won't. Are you kidding me right now? Mom screamed so loud that my sister came running downstairs. She took one look at the scene.

On the drive home, mom was really quiet, and when dad asked if she was okay, she said something about passive aggressiveness, which I didn't understand, but I figured it must be another way adults say I love you. I decided that if Aunt Penn loved mom so much that she gave her all those special compliments, I should do the same thing for Aunt Penn, because I love her, too. The next Sunday at church, I saw my chance. When Aunt Penn walked up wearing a pretty, flowery dress, I remembered exactly how she talked to mom and said to her, wow, Aunt Penn, you look pregnant in that dress. When's the baby coming? Her face went completely white, then red, then kind of purple, and she just stood there with her Mouth open like a goldfish. Mom, who was talking to Missus Abernathy, turned around so fast she almost spilled her coffee. And then she started coughing really hard, but it sounded more like laughing for some reason. Aunt Penn finally said, thank you, sweetie, in this tiny voice, and mom had to excuse herself to go to the bathroom because she was coughing laughing so much. Dad asked me what I said, and when I told him I was just being nice like Aunt Penn, he got this funny look.

My teacher made us all have assigned seating, and I got stuck in the back next to the quiet kid. He always weirded me out. Never talked to anyone, just drew these weird, dark sketches in his notebook during lectures. But that Tuesday morning started normal. I was trying to stay awake when a piece of paper slid onto my desk from his direction. Note was folded into a tight square, and when I opened it, his handwriting was surprisingly neat. Enjoy your last few minutes alive. My first thought was that this was some weird prank. Maybe he was finally trying to make friends in the most awkward way possible. So I turned back to give him a confused look, but his face was serious. Another note hit my desk. Just one word. Look. I glanced back and saw his backpack partially open, something dark and metallic visible inside. It was a handgun. My hands started shaking so bad, I dropped my pencil. Our teacher was writing formulas and had no idea what was going on. 28 other students in the room. My mind raced through the options. I could run out the door right now, save myself, but everyone else would be at risk. I could yell at everyone to run, but his hand was already halfway in his bag, and I'd probably be first. I. I pulled the fire alarm, but it was across the Room. My stomach churned, and I genuinely thought I might throw up right there on my desk. Then it hit me. The bathroom pass. I could ask to go to the bathroom, walk past it to the office. Warn them quietly. They could call the police. Lock down the school. Do it.

My mother introduces him like she's presenting a prize. This is Cameron. He has his own practice. Theo looked up from his laptop. What did you do? I sat through three hours of him explaining different. Different types of dental floss. Did you know there's waxed, unwaxed tape and ultra thin? Because I do now. I slumped in my chair. My mom kept kicking me under the table whenever I checked my phone. Then she follows me to the bathroom and says he has excellent benefits and a summer house. Compelling argument, Theo said. I sighed, staring at him while he stared at his laptop like it was the only thing that mattered. I actually do need to get married, though, don't I, Theo? Stop typing completely. He looked at me for a long moment. I swallowed hard at the sudden eye contact, and he closed his laptop. If you're going to get married, will you marry me? I waited for the punchline. It didn't come. That's not funny. I'm not joking, Theo. You Just proposed while I was complaining about my mother. Who does that? Someone who's been waiting four years for the right moment and just realized there isn't one. He stood up, walked to his filing cabinet. This is coming out wrong. At least he was self aware. He pulled out a folder from the bottom drawer. My name was written on the tab. Do you remember the Valdez acquisition? That was four years ago. We were both senior analysts. You stayed until 3:00am redoing slide 12. You said it didn't convey confidence. He opened the folder. Inside were thank you notes. Everyone I'd written him over the years.

I stared at my wife's quarter carat solitaire that had taken me 19 months to pay off, while she looked down in complete confusion. What ring? I asked, my stomach already twisting into knots. Grandfather's smile faded as he studied my wife's hand. The four carat edwardian diamond worth $82,000 that grandma specifically gave your mother to give to you when she went into hospice. She wanted you to have it for this sweet girl who spent every Sunday with her for five years. My mother's champagne glass shattered against her dinner plate, sending golden liquid pooling across the tablecloth. Dad, you're confused.

I want my grandson to have my engagement ring for this beautiful girl who visited me every Sunday for five years. Give me caramel macchiatos and teaching me technology and listening to all my stories. The ring threw rainbow prisms across the walls as she held it up.

By the time I was 17, I had already raised eight of my mom's adopted children. You see, my mom was obsessed with social status. Every adoption got her another newspaper article, another 10,000 likes on Facebook. The thing was, she never actually wanted to parent them. That was my job. It all started when I was 9 and she brought home the first baby. Immature infant from Guatemala who needed round the clock care. You're so mature for your age, she'd said, handing me the feeding schedule at 3 a m. This will teach you responsibility. Well, I was making the kids packed lunches when she called a family meeting and slid photos across the table. Three babies from Ukraine, all under 2, one with cerebral palsy. Mom, I can't do this anymore, I said, voice shaking. I need to finish school. I've already missed 47 days this year. She tilted her head. Are you saying you won't help these innocent children? I'm saying I'm 17 and exhausted. That night, after everyone was asleep, she came to my room. Fine. Don't help. She showed me their medical files. But either you care for them, she said quietly, or they suffer. Your choice. My head spun while I processed what she was saying. She knew I couldn't watch babies suffer, that I would always choose them over me. The next morning, I tested the waters. Instead of staying home with Vance, who had The flu. I went to first period. Just one class. When I got home, I found my four year old brother, Danny on the kitchen floor, shaking. He's diabetic and his blood sugar was 32. Mom was on the couch scrolling through her phone. Oh, no, she said, not looking up. I completely forgot his insulin schedule. Guess that's just what happens when you choose to be selfish. That afternoon, I tried telling my school counselor. I didn't even finish the sentence before my phone buzzed. Mom's text. Gigi's inhaler seems to be missing. Help me look when you get home. I ran home and found mom holding the inhaler, examining it like she'd never seen one.

But the worst part was what I walked in on that evening. Mom had all the kids who could talk sitting in a circle. Remember? She was saying in her sweet voice, if anyone ever asks, I'm the best mommy ever. Because if you say anything else, they'll take you away and you'll never see each other again. Six year old Gigi was crying. But you're mean to Talia. My name. Mom's face went cold. Old Talia wants to abandon you. I'm the only one keeping this family together. Now what do we say if someone asks? THE children CHORUS in tiny, terrified voices you're the best mommy ever. She made them practice it five more times before bed. I stopped fighting after that. If she wanted me to give it my all, I would do exactly that. I dropped out of school. Not officially. Just stopped going. And when I did show up, I brought the toddlers. These are mine. I told my chemistry teacher when she asked why I was bringing children to learn about the periodic table. I sold her jewelry to buy formula and kept every receipt. I used her credit card at the pharmacy, let them flag it for fraud. When a teenager bought $400 of prescription medications. Two weeks later, she announced she was adopting. Premature twins with serious heart defects need surgery within six months or They won't survive, she said at dinner, like she was discussing the weather. The adoption agency needs proof of a full time caregiver. She looked right at me. I told them you deferred college. The next morning, she left for a five day charity retreat in the Bahamas. Just left a note on the counter with the twins feeding schedule. One was on a heart monitor that beeped if his oxygen dropped below 90. It dropped every hour. Then Francesca, our three year old, had a seizure in the bathtub while I was trying to cool the babies down. I called 9 1 1 with the baby under each arm. Francesca convulsing on the bathroom floor. The paramedics found me. Saw thing covered in vomit with 14 kids, the twins monitor shrieking. Where are your parents? They asked. I showed them Mom's text from the Bahamas. Handle it. That's what you're for. Don't call again. I'm in a meditation session. The hospital social worker pulled me aside the next day.

She had no idea I owned the place. We sat down, and before I could even reach for my menu, Mia snatched it away from me. She announced to the whole restaurant, the pasta is cheapest. You to get that. Actually, we should split one plate. Save Jess some money. My face got hot when the server came over, Mia ordered for me like I was five years old. She said, he'll have water, no appetizer. Then she turned to me with this fake sympathetic smile. Jess mentioned you're between opportunities right now. Jess looked confused and said, I never said that. Mia interrupted, it's fine. Not everyone can have a real career. Some people are just freeloaders. She dragged out that last word while staring directly into my eyes. She watched me drink my water and her nose wrinkled up. You hold your glass with both hands like a toddler. Were you raised in a barn? The couple at the next table was already whispering about us. She continued, this is probably the only nice restaurant you've been to before trapping Jess. You probably ate from dumpsters. I ate here three times a week, but I couldn't say that. She studied my plain T-shirt. Like it was contaminated. Goodwill, Salvation Army. Jess probably had to teach you not to wear sweatpants to restaurants. She dress you every morning, too? My hands started sweating. She said you're nothing without her money. When's the last time you paid for anything? Do you even have a wallet? It got so much worse. She pulled out her phone and started showing Jess pictures of other men. Remember Tom? Harvard Law. Just made partner. Still asks about you. She swiped to another photo. This is Anthony. Cardiac surgeon. Just bought a yacht. Another swipe. Your ex just sold his company for 30 million. These are men who can provide. She grabbed Jess

Except this time was different. This time, I wasn't dropping my plans for her. God, I can't believe he did this to me, she said, already pulling up Netflix on my TV. We're watching that show we used to love of, and you're gonna tell me I'm better off without him? I went back to my room and grabbed my duffel bag with my gear while she ranted about the guy she loved so much she ditched Me 47 times. My friends pulled up to the driveway and honked the horn twice. I open the front door and started lacing up my shoes when Mara turned to look at me with a confused expression. Where are you going? Utah rock climbing, I said calmly. She jumped up from the couch so fast she almost knocked over the wine. What? You can't leave! I'm literally having a crisis right now. Then she actually started unpacking my duffel bag, throwing clothes and gear I had neatly packed across the room. Cancel it!

I have the paternity test results. I know the baby isn't mine. She stared at me. Then the fake tear started. Some sob story about it being just one mistake when we were fighting about money. I've seen the messages, I said. I heard you talking to Ashley. The mask. I'm completely off. The crying stopped, replaced by a cold look I'd never seen. You went through my phone. You recorded me without permission. You were planning fraud and you're worried about privacy. Then she said the line that will haunt me forever. Even if the baby isn't biologically yours, you're still going to be his father, like it or not. We're getting married in two months. I'm not letting you ruin our family over some stupid technicality. A technicality? She called paternity fraud a technicality. There's not going to be a wedding, Britney. She lost it screaming in the restaurant about how I was abandoning my responsibility. Other customers stared. The manager came over. You think you're so smart, she hissed. Good luck finding someone else who will put Up with your boring ass. Just a blue collar worker with a truck payment. I walked out while she was still screaming, drove straight to the wedding venue and canceled everything. Lost the 2,500 dollar deposit, but it felt like the best money I'd ever spent.

When she got pregnant seven months ago, I proposed the day she told me. Because that's what you do when you're about to be a dad, right? Something felt off from the moment I proposed. He wasn't excited. More like she was doing me a favor by saying yes. But I pushed down those gut feeling. I've been covering everything since she got pregnant. Doctor visits, baby gear, her rent when her nail salon income dropped. Plus her health insurance. Nearly $8,000 so far. Plus the 4,200 dollar engagement ring. She always mentioned this personal trainer, Derek, from her gym, claiming he was just helping with prenatal exercises. Something about how she talked about him always bothered me. Then came the afternoon that changed everything. I got off work early and decided to surprise her with dinner from that expensive sushi place she loved. I let myself in and heard voices from the kitchen. I was about to announce myself when I heard her talking to her sister Ashley. I still can't believe you're actually marrying him. Damien's got great insurance and steady money, but girl, you're really settling. Derek can't provide what this baby need. Britney replied, Damien can. My blood went cold.

Behind him, Karen stood in her driveway. Phone out, live streaming to her Facebook group. I have cameras, I said immediately. Everything's recorded. We reviewed the footage. Right there on my porch. The CPS worker watched Karen climb my fence, watched her terrify my daughter. Watched Buddy perform exact exactly as a 30,000 dollar service dog should. Protecting Emma while calling for help. Watched me respond immediately. The animal control officer spoke first. Ma'am, that's the best trained service animal I've seen in 20 years. The CPS worker was next. I'll be filing a report, all right? About the neighbor harassing a special needs child. But the lead officer, he walked straight to Karen's driveway. Ma'am, you're under arrest for criminal trespassing. Filing a False report and harassment of a disabled minor. The live stream caught everything. Her Facebook friends watched her get handcuffed, but the dog was aggressive.

I said yes for reasons I'm not ashamed of. But those reasons don't obligate me forever. I looked at Lauren. I promised your mother I'd take care of you. Not that I'd underwrite a lifestyle. Lifestyle? Chase repeated, ugly in his mouth. Yes. The mortgage, the kids, school, groceries, your car, the bar tabs. Where the story about me changes. Depending on the audience.

We moved to this quiet suburb specifically because Emma needed stability after years of failed treatments and school bullying. Our neighbour Karen started her campaign against us immediately. That dog barks. She complained on day one. Buddy had whimpered once, his alert signal that Emma was distressed. I explained about Emma's autism, how Buddy was literally her voice. Karen's response well, maybe she belongs in a special facility then. I installed cameras after that comment. Good thing I did. Emma loves routine. Every morning at 7 a. M. She and Buddy do Rainbow time in our backyard. She arranges colored toys and patterns while Buddy sits guard. It's her therapy, recommended by three different specialists. Violent, peaceful, bothering nobody. Last Tuesday I was inside making Emma's specific breakfast. She only eats yellow foods on Tuesdays when Buddy started his alert bark. Not aggressive. Three short barks, meaning Emma needs help now. I rushed outside to find Karen in our yard, having climbed our fence trying to document the neglect with her phone. Emma was in full meltdown mode.

My neighbour Bethany treated her Pomeranian, Princess, like a golden ticket to break every rule. The fake service vest fooled nobody with experience. She'd bring Princess into the gym, claiming emotional support privileges while the dog peed on equipment. She'd let Princess destroy the community garden because service animals need enrichment activities. She'd have Princess bark through movie nights, insisting it was medical alert behaviour. Living in the same building meant I witnessed Bethany's blaming abuse of the system. First was Mister Beckett in the grocery store. Princess tore into his bags, scattered food everywhere while snarling. When he asked Bethany to pay for damages, she screamed about discrimination. She threatened to sue him for trapping her service animal. He was an elderly widower who couldn't afford lawyers. He just absorbed the loss. Two weeks later, during a residents meeting, Princess defecated next to the coffee station. Our property manager asked Bethany to clean it. She exploded about ADA violations and demanded written apologies. She called the Fair Housing Department while the manager cleaned feces in front of 30 residents. Stephanie still filed a formal complaint, claiming the building created a hostile environment. The worst came when Princess attacked Derek's actual service dog, Duke. Duke was a German Shepherd who helped Derek walk after losing his leg overseas. Princess lashed on to Duke's ear at the mailboxes, drawing blood. Duke remained perfectly still. Derek Almost fell without Duke's support. Bethany immediately filed paperwork claiming Duke was aggressive and intimidating. She demanded he be banned from the building. Three weeks after Derek's attack, I was returning from the VA hospital with Ranger. My PTSD service dog nudged my hand, warning my heart rate was spiking. The elevator opened, revealing Bethany and Princess. Pomeranian launched across the lobby and locked onto Ranger's shoulder. Teeth sank deep in muscle. Blood seeped through his fur. While Ranger stayed motionless, still trying to work. I pried Princess's jaws apart with my hands. Your mother attacked my medical alert dog. Bethany shrieked, already dialing 9 1 1. Any police here now? A dangerous dog tried to kill mine. She told dispatch I was faking disability, that Ranger was aggressive. Four hours at the station defending my documentation. Four hours while Ranger waited at the emergency vet for 12 stitches. Four hours of explaining how a certified service dog could stand perfectly still while being mauled, watching them stitch Ranger's

My mother waved printed discord screenshots at me in Grandma's living room screaming about elder abuse while my dad sat there checking his phone because his guild started playing in 20 minutes. She kept shouting that teaching an 80 year old woman violent video games was destroying her mind while dad muttered about missing his game for this. Non.

My dad actually played the game religiously and is the ones who introduced me to it, though he'd never admit it at work. Grandma's eyes focused for the first time in weeks when she saw the spell effects and asked if she could make the fire bigger. Within three days she was running dungeons on her own and asking me questions about which abilities to pick that I had to Google because she'd already surpassed my casual knowledge. After a month she was teaching me secret tricks I didn't know existed, and she chose in the username Defi Knitting and joined a guild without telling me, though she mentioned making friends who didn't constantly ask about her cholesterol levels. Then my mother discovered grandma wearing a headset shouting tank the Boss properly or I'll shove my cane somewhere extremely uncomfortable at her monitor. During one of the hardest battles in the game, she called me, screaming that I turned her mother in law into a gambling addict because online games were just slot machines with dragons, and that I was destroying an old woman's golden years. She tried canceling Grandma's internet, but grandma had already switched everything into her own name with two factor authentication. After her guild warned her about family member controlling elderly gamers.

I've never loved him more. I've always known I'm not conventionally attractive. It's just a fact I've lived with my entire life. Growing up, kids called me names. In high school, I was invisible to boys. In college, I watched my roommates get asked out while I stayed home studying. But when I met Charles four years ago at a coffee shop where I spilled latte all over his laptop, he made me feel beautiful for the first time in my life. He never just said I was pretty and left it at that. He trace my face with his fingers and tell me I had the kindest eyes he'd ever seen. He kiss my forehead and say my smile could light up any room. For four years, I actually started believing him. Last Saturday, his college buddies came over for their monthly hangout. These guys have been friends since freshman year. The kind of bond where they could say anything to each other. I was upstairs in the kitchen making my famous buffalo chicken dip and cutting up vegetables when I heard their voices drifting up from the basement rec room. I shouldn't have listened, but I couldn't help myself. At first it was normal guy talk. Work complaints, fantasy football, whose turn it was to pick the next restaurant for their group dinner. Then I heard my name. They were absolutely roasting Charles about me. Dude, seriously? Her? Arthur laughed, and I could Hear the beer bottles clinking? I mean, what happened to your standards, man? Another voice, I think it was Anthony, chimed in. Yeah, she's got a nice personality and all, but come on. She's what we used to call a butterface back in the day. The whole group erupted in laughter that made my stomach drop. Remember when you used to date those sorority girls? Someone else added. What was her name? Amber. Now she was smoking hot. I gripped the kitchen counter, my knuckles turning white. This was my worst nightmare coming true. These were Charles's closest friends, the guys he'd known longest, and they were talking about me like I was some charity case. Then Charles exploded. His voice boomed through the house.

So I spent years perfecting my payback. I discovered Dave's cheating when I saw a graphic text on his work phone. The message was explicit and had no business being on anyone's work device. For a split second, I just stared at the lock screen showing the sender's name, Paula. My brain immediately started connecting dots I've been ignoring for months. Dave always stepped out to take calls, meaning hippo violations. If I overheard, he'd come home with the same perfume scent saying he helped move female patients. Our bedroom life had cooled off significantly, and he was always getting called in for sick nurse coverage at odd hours. But he. Here's the thing. When our kid left a book in Dave's car, I had an excuse to visit the hospital. I casually mentioned to a lobby nurse how work phones seem convenient but keep you on call 24 7. She laughed and said the hospital was too cheap for nurse phone. Only high level executives got them. Dave wasn't an executive. I rushed to a divorce lawyer the next day, but the news was devastating. Community, property, state. No fault divorce. I made more money. He was primary caretaker of our three kids. If I filed, I'd lose the house, pay alimony, child support, and give him half my retirement. The worst part? His affair didn't legally matter. At all. I was crushed until my friend Andy said something that changed everything. If you don't like the hand you're dealt, change the. I had two problems to solve. First, I needed to become the primary caretaker. I transferred to a regulatory admin position that nobody wanted. Just number crunching. With flexible hours, I could work from home and set my own schedule. With my newfound freedom, I started picking up the kids from school, helping with homework, making dinner every night. I can't explain how much I genuinely enjoyed being more involved in their daily lives. Meanwhile, Dave seemed relieved to have more study time. Second, Dave needed to out earn me. I

My cousin Ashley has mimicked everything I've done since we were kids. Same clothes, same haircuts, same hobbies. When I Learned guitar, she bought one the next week. When I got into photography, suddenly she was a photographer, too. It was annoying, but I thought she'd grow out of it. I was wrong. It got worse in college. Same major as me. Marketing. Same internships. She even transferred to my university sophomore year, claiming she just loved the campus. When she visited me after graduation, I moved to Portland for a job. Guess who showed up six months later? Ashley. With a job at a competing company. She rented an apartment two blocks from mine. But the final straw was when she started dating my ex boyfriend, Richard. We dated for two years in college. He cheated on me with some girl from his fraternity, and it destroyed me. Ashley knew all of this? She was there when I cried about it for months. Yet suddenly, they're soulmates who met through fate. Their Instagram was nauseating, recreating the exact same photos Richard and I used to take. Same restaurants, same hiking spots, even the same poses. My family thought it was romantic. They're so perfect together. My aunt would gush. I wanted to scream. Then Ashley started copying my social media posts word for word. I'd post about trying a new coffee shop. She'd post the same review. The next day I'd share a workout routine. She'd claim it was her personal fitness journey. She even copied my dog's Instagram captions for her cat. It was getting psychotic, so I decided to test just how far she'd go. First I posted about my amazing new skincare routine drinking a shot of apple cider vinegar every morning. Complete lie, but I made it sound life changing. My skin has never looked better. This ancient remedy is incredible. Three days later, Ashley posted her morning vinegar shot video. She was trying not to gag, but captioned it already seeing amazing results. For two weeks, she posted daily.

My seven year old daughter started telling me she was seeing a man walking around our house at night. Every time I just laughed, passing it off as one of those weird things kids say. But every morning she kept repeating the same story. She said she heard someone sneak into our house while we were asleep, that he'd climb in through the living room window, then go upstairs and hurt my son. At first I thought she just had an overactive imagination. I mean, I know if someone was actually breaking in, wouldn't I? Still, something about the way she said it started to creep me out. So that night, I made sure every door and window was locked before heading to bed. I even double checked the alarm system and told myself it was just for peace of mind. Around three in the morning, my daughter came running into our bedroom. She was shaking and said, he's here again. This time I didn't brush it off. I grabbed my flashlight and hurried downstairs. Every door was locked, but when I got to the living room window, I pulled on it and it slid open without any resistance. My heart dropped. She wasn't imagining it. Someone had been getting in. I bolted upstairs and grabbed my rifle from the closet, then quietly crept down the hallway toward my son's room. I took a deep breath, pushed open his door, and Aimed into the dark. There was someone in there, punched over my son's bed. My finger was already on the trigger. Then my son screamed, stop! I flipped on the light. What I saw made me freeze. It wasn't a grown man. It was a teenager, maybe 17 or 18. My son scrambled out of bed, throwing himself between us. I lowered the rifle, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. My brain felt like it short circuited. The intruder wasn't hurting him. He was holding him, comforting him. That's when it clicked. This guy wasn't a stranger. He was my son's boyfriend. Apparently, they've been sneaking around for months. My son hadn't told us he was gay, let alone in a relationship. He thought we wouldn't accept it. His boyfriend, not wanting to get him in trouble, had been sneaking into the house late at night, not realizing anyone else knew. I stood there in silence, rifle in one hand, flashlight in the other, heart still pounding in my ear.

A couple months ago, my twin sister and I had just started high school. At first, I thought she was just adjusting, but within a few weeks, I noticed something was seriously wrong. She barely spoke, kept her head down in the hallways. And the second we got home, she would rush into her room and lock the door. Most nights, I heard her crying through the walls. Teacher started calling home. They said she was always in tears during class. Couldn't focus, and her grades were falling fast. Tried asking her what was wrong, but she always forced a smile and told me everything was fine. It wasn't. One day, I found her sitting on the bathroom floor, her eyes swollen and a bottle of sleeping pills open beside her. That was the moment I knew something had to change. My mom sat me down that night and told me the truth. There was a senior boy at school who had been bullying my sister. He would shove her into lockers, tear up her homework in front of other students, and humiliate her in the hallways while everyone watched. She had never said a word about it to me. My mom looked me in the eyes and said, do whatever you need to do. I don't care what the school says. I'll forgive you. I didn't waste a second. I started asking around and eventually found out the guy's name was Brian. He was a smug, blond haired senior who spent most of his time alone and skipped class constantly. Every day at 11:15 in the morning, he would sneak off to the far gym bathroom to smoke. So I waited. One day, I skipped class and locked myself in the stall of that same bathroom. As soon as he walked in, I came out and locked the door behind him. He barely had time to speak before I slammed into him and knocked him to the ground. I pulled a rope from my backpack and wrapped it tightly around his body, pinning his arms to his sides. Then I started swinging punch after punch. I didn't stop. His face, his ribs, his chest, whatever I could hit. I wanted him to feel what my sister had been feeling for months. He cried and begged me to stop, but I didn't care. Who's the tough guy now? But I wasn't done. I pulled out my car keys, aimed right between his legs, and tried to tear him apart. His screams were so loud that a staff member heard.

I've been an ER doctor for 12 years, and you start to get a sixth sense when something doesn't seem right. Last Thursday, our nurse caught my arm before I entered Exam Room 3. The aunt in there, she said quietly, making a face I couldn't quite read. Make sure you know the girl's okay. Before leaving her alone. I walked inside to see this woman and the girl who had been badly hurt. Oh, good, finally, she said. I asked her what happened, and she told me her niece Daisy fell off the playground equipment at the park. Kids, right? She gave a tight smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. But then again, people react to stress differently. I took a look at her head, and it was bad. Daisy was being remarkably brave, while her brother Jimmy sniffled beside her. She's usually more careful, she added, checking her watch. How long do these things usually take? I looked closer at Daisy's head, but thought it was strange. It did look like it was from falling on the ground at all. I asked Daisy to tell me exactly how she fell. I was on the monkey bars, and then I. She trailed off, glancing nervously at her aunt. Go on, her aunt said sharply. Tell him how clumsy you were. That tone made me pause. I studied the wound pattern more carefully. I started to realize what was really Going on. Ma'am, why don't you and Jimmy wait outside while I prep Daisy for stitches? It can be scary for little ones to watch. He seemed relieved to leave, finally. Come on, Jimmy. Stop that crying. Once they were gone, I gently asked Daisy again. Sweetie, I need to know what really happened so I can help you properly. Her eyes filled with tears, but she. She stayed silent, shaking her head. She was terrified of something. Or someone. I made a decision. I knew I wasn't letting this poor girl go back out there, so I had to get the truth. There was something going on. I'll be right back. I found Jimmy in the hallway with their Aunt. Jimmy, can you come hold Daisy's hand for her? She's really scared. She waved us off without looking up. The moment we were alone, I asked him to tell me what happened. He had that same look in his.

My mom's this 4 11 woman who works at a library and knit scarves for charity. But I've watched grown men literally back away from her at grocery stores and cross streets when they see her coming. I found out why last week, and it's absolutely terrifying. When I was 8 years old, some punk teenager kept breaking into cars in our neighborhood. Hit everyone's car multiple times over several months, stealing whatever he could find. Phones, wallets, who's change, anything valuable left visible. This kid was relentless. Didn't care about security cameras or motion lights. Just kept coming back, night after night, like some kind of criminal ghost. One night around midnight, he smashes my mom's passenger window with a crowbar and steals her entire purse. Inside was $800 in cash, a rent money that she just withdrawn from the bank. Also her credit cards, driver's license, house keys, work badge, everything important. We called the police immediately and filed a report. The cops were sympathetic, but said there was nothing they could realistically do. No cameras caught his face, no witnesses saw the break in, no fingerprints on the glass. Just another case number. My mom just nodded politely and thank the officers for their time. She seemed unusually calm about losing $800. Three days later, she spending every afternoon at the library after work, researching on computers for hours, printing out pages of documents, making dozens Of phone calls, taking detailed notes in that tiny, precise handwriting. Turns out she'd figured out who the kid was from security footage at a nearby gas station. Cross reference time stamps. Tracked his route backwards. Found his social media from a partial license plate reflection. Found his address, full schedule, friends, family members, job. Everything about his entire life. But here's where it gets absolutely insane. During her investigation, she discovered his mom was having a full blown affair with their neighbor three houses down. Hotel meetings twice a week.

Everyone's taking pictures, and I'm thinking maybe Tyler actually listened for once. Wrong. Right after dinner, Tyler gets up and taps his champagne glass. I thought he was just gonna do a regular brother toast. Instead, he drops to one knee right there in front of everyone and pulls out a ring. Casey starts crying and screaming, yes! And suddenly, half the room is taking pictures of them instead of us. I was absolutely furious. But with my mom glaring at me from across the room, I couldn't do anything without causing a scene. Jake squeezed my hand and whispered, we'll deal with this later. The rest of the night, people kept coming up to congratulate Tyler and Casey at my own wedding. Fast forward eight months. Tyler's getting married. Jake and I found out we were pregnant just two weeks before his wedding. We hadn't told anyone yet because we wanted to wait until after the first trimester. But then I had an idea. The reception starts, and they asked me to give a toast as the sister of the groom. I stand up with my champagne glass, except mine's actually just sparkling apple juice. I want to welcome Casey to our crazy family. I start off normal, and since we're all here together, family that Tyler doesn't see very often, I thought this would be the perfect time to share some exciting news. I pause and look right at my mom.

Everyone thought I hit the Jackpot. When I started dating Elias, he wasn't just any doctor. He was young, successful, and his dad literally sat on the hospital board. My parents were obsessed with him. They called him doctor perfect behind his back and brag to everyone at church about their daughter dating such a catch. What they didn't see was how he treated me. When we were alone, Elias timed my meals like I was some kind of patient. He'd check his watch when I ate and tell me I was going too fast or too slow. He criticized how loud I talked, saying doctor's wives needed to have appropriate volume control. Every Sunday morning, he made me step on his fancy digital scale for my health and would write down the number in this little notebook. Even corrected how I held my fork at dinner, repositioning my fingers like I was 5 years old. I thought it was just because he cared about me looking good in front of people. My friends said I was lucky to have someone who wanted to help me improve myself. But then my dad had a heart attack on a Tuesday night. Mom called me crying, saying they were rushing him to the ER. When I got there, guess who was on call. Elias. Mom grabbed my arm and whispered, it's a sign from god that He's here to save your father. Elias took charge immediately, which should have been comforting, but something felt off about the whole thing. He seemed too prepared, too calm. Like he already knew what was wrong with my dad. When I asked questions, he brushed me off with medical terms I didn't understand. Dad got better after a few days, but I couldn't shake this weird feeling. I started going through his medicine cabinet, just looking at all the pill bottles. That's when I saw it. Elias's name on three different prescription labels from the past.

I spent that wedding weekend at home watching Netflix and eating pizza alone while my entire extended family celebrated without me. Four weddings, four exclusions. Fast forward eight years to my own engagement. Planning the wedding with my fiance was actually therapeutic. We were creating something that was entirely ours. When it came time for the guest list, I wrote down names of people. People who'd shown up for me over the years. Friends, college roommates, co workers who'd become family. My four siblings. Names never made it onto the paper. The family group chat exploded when invitations went out. Did our invites get lost in the mail? Lenarda texted. The mailman has been unreliable lately. Fernanda added. Bernardo called directly. There has to be some mistake. Why aren't we on the list? I ignored every message, every call. Finally, mom showed up at my apartment, furious. What is wrong with you? This is your family. I looked at her calmly and said, you excluded me from every single milestone that mattered. Now I'm returning the favor. It's really that simple? Her face turned red. That's completely different. You were a child. Exactly. I said I was a child who desperately wanted to be included in his family.

I knew something was wrong when my son stopped showing me his artwork. Every day after school, he used to run to me with his drawings, proud of each messy masterpiece. Then suddenly, nothing. At first, I thought maybe he'd lost interest in art. But one day, I was cleaning his room and found them. Dozens of drawings stuffed under his bed. All of them were of the same thing. Little boy with two dads. One crossed out with angry black scribbles. That's when I remembered the parent teacher conference from last week. His teacher had mentioned they were doing family tree projects. My son had gotten unusually quiet after that. I sat him down that night and asked about the drawings. He burst into tears, saying the kids at school told him I wasn't his real dad because he was adopted. That his real dad was out there somewhere and that's who belonged on his family tree. I hugged him tight and grabbed his art supplies. Together, we drew a new family tree. Instead of a regular tree, we made a giant heart with branches growing out of it. See, I told him, some families grow from hearts instead of trees. He hung that drawing in his room last week at school. He proudly presented it, explaining how love makes a family, not DNA. His teacher called me later, crying, saying three other adopted kids in different classes had asked to Redo their projects the same way. Sometimes the smallest hearts teach the biggest lesson.

A good looking guy was at the bar talking about a date he had with a girl his best friend was secretly in love with. His friend never made a move because she was into him instead. The guy was deep into his story when she walked in, stunning in a little black dress and high heels. They greeted each other with a kiss and took tequila shots together, the banter quickly heating up. Out of nowhere, he whistles at me like I'm a dog and says, Yo! Oh man, more shots. Disappointed, I pour them and let him know I'm not a dog. He brushes it off, saying, just keep an eye out, we're gonna get lit. As the night goes on, he gets louder, laughing at his own jokes and talking over the girl. Then he announces he needs to pee on a rock and stumbles to the back. The girl looks mortified, texting furiously. He returns with another guy, not fully drunk but well on his way, and makes an offhand comment before stumbling outside. His friend follows, leaving the girl alone. Five minutes later, the friend returns, says he put Bob in an Uber, and takes the girl to dinner. But 30 minutes later, Bob walks back in sober, apologizes for whistling, and buys us a drink. He admits he played the fool on purpose so his friend could save the day. He's better for her. He Said she's not my type. I was both touched and impressed.

How did you get back at a horrible customer? I worked at Rosie's Diner for almost two years, saving up for college. Most customers were decent, but this one guy named Doug made my shifts hell. Every Tuesday at lunch, he'd show up with his work buddies, acting like he owned the place. Doug would snap his fingers at me, complain about everything, and never left a single little tip. Not even a quarter. The worst part? He'd mock me in front of his co workers. Called me sweetheart in this condescending way. Once I brought the wrong salad dressing, and he literally rolled his eyes and said, loud enough for everyone to hear, can't even handle ranch dressing? Good luck in life. His buddies would laugh. I'd smile and apologize because I needed this job. One Tuesday, Doug came in extra loud. He was bragging about some presentation he gave. When I took their order, he mumbled something about no onions on his burger. Kitchen was slammed, so when his food came out with onions, he lost it. Are you kidding me right now? Do I need to spell everything out for you? His voice carried across the whole restaurant. I apologized and got him a new burger. But while I was walking back to their table, I heard one of his co workers, Amy, whisper to another guy, he's always like this. It's embarrassing. That caught my attention. Amy seemed uncomfortable. Every time Doug went off on Me. After they left with their usual zero tip, I had an idea. I remembered Doug mentioning he worked at Fletcher Marketing down the street, so I did some research.

She pulled away from me quickly. Just playing at school. My stomach tightened because after three years of fostering, I knew that look. Lily, you can tell me anything. Was someone rough with you? No. Can I go to bed now? She practically ran to her room. Before I could follow, my phone buzzed with a text from my other foster son, Jason. Is Lily okay? She was crying in the bathroom earlier. Do you know if anyone's been bothering her? No, but she's been acting weird, like, really tired all the time. The next morning, the school nurse called while I was at work. Missus parks, I need to discuss Lily's injuries. She has bruising on her arms and what looks like scratches on her legs. My mouth went dry. She said it was from playing. She told me they happened at home. I'm required to document this. The threat hit me like ice water. They thought I was hurting her. I'll need to file a report with child services. Someone will be contacting you within 72 hours. After hanging up, I sat in my car shaking. Three foster kids under my roof, and now I was being investigated. They could take all of them away. That night, I watched everyone like a hawk. Jason was doing homework. My youngest foster daughter, Kia Was coloring. Normal evening, except Lily kept nodding off at dinner. Didn't you sleep well? I asked. I had weird dreams, she mumbled into her Mac and cheese. What kind of dreams? She shrugged and asked to be excused two days until the home visit. I found pine needles in Lily's hair while braiding it, which made no sense since we lived in a suburban neighborhood with only oak trees. Were you playing in someone's yard? No, but her hands twisted her rabbit's ears nervously. Jason pulled me aside that night. Something's up with Lily's window. I followed him to her room, where she

Not only did our entire school show up, but students from three neighboring schools came too. Some brought their families. Local businesses chipped in with food, raffle prizes and donations. One restaurant matched every dollar raised. The gym was packed wall to wall. Teams played from morning until night. And nobody wanted to leave. By the end of the weekend, we had raised over $15,000. I'll never forget the look on Mister Patel's face when Marcus handed him the envelope. He didn't say anything at first, just hugged Marcus tight. Eyes full of tears.

That's when she completely broke down and confessed everything. She'd faked the entire kidnapping. Spent 18 straight hours in that library writing her history paper on post war propaganda during the Cold War. Survived on vending machine coffee and energy drinks. All because she couldn't face failing my class and losing her scholarship. The administration was furious. Suspended her immediately. Talked about pressing charges for filing false reports, wasting police resources. But I asked to see her paper first. Couldn't help my curiosity about what drove a kid to such extremes. What I read blew my mind. 47 pages of brilliant analysis connecting Cold War propaganda techniques to modern social media manipulation. Original research, primary sources. I'd never seen students use arguments so sophisticated. They belonged in graduate school. This girl understood desperation and manipulation better than most political science professors. She'd lived it for one terrifying night. I stared at that paper for hours. Technically, she missed the deadline. School policy was clear, but she demonstrated more understanding of historical context through her actions than most students showed in their writing. The irony was perfect. A paper about propaganda written during an act of propaganda. I gave her an A. Quietly, never announced it. She graduated with honors by half a point, kept her scholarship, never spoke about what happened again.

I teach A P. History at Jefferson High, and my final paper deadline was legendary for being brutal. No extensions, no excuses, no second chances. I'd failed seniors weeks before graduation before. Everyone knew this. This girl, Rebecca, had a 78% average and needed a solid A on the final to graduate with honours. Her scholarship depended on it. When the deadline hit, she wasn't there. Her paper wasn't submitted. Nothing. That morning, Rebecca's mom burst into Principal Wilson's office, sobbing hysterically. Her daughter never came home from tutoring last night. Phone was dead. Location tracker showed nothing for hours. Complete panic mode hit the school. Missing person's report filed within an hour. Police brought dogs. Local news vans started showing up. Teachers were crying in the break room, talking about how sweet Rebecca was. Everyone assumed the worst. Search parties formed, helicopters circled the area. Social media exploded with her picture. The whole town was looking for this girl. Her mom was on the news, begging for her safe return. Even I felt sick, thinking something terrible happened to one of my students. Twenty four hours passed. Nothing. Then suddenly, around six PM, Rebecca was found behind some dumpster at a gas station 20 miles away. She told police this wild story about being grabbed by some random guy who panicked and let her go. But things felt off immediately. Zero injuries on her body, no defensive wounds. Her phone records showed it never actually left the city limits. Most suspicious part was security footage from near her last known location.

My grandmother passed away last year and settling her estate turned into a nightmare thanks to one absolutely ridiculous Bill. She'd been in a nursing home for her final six months, and we thought we'd handled all the paperwork and payments. Then three months after her funeral, I got a Bill in the mail addressed to her estate for eight hundred forty seven dollars and fifty cents from Sunset Manor Care Facility. I figured it was probably some final medical charge we'd missed, so I called to sort it out. The billing department put me on hold for 20 minutes before a woman named Janet came on the line. She very matter of factly explained that the charge was for post residency room cleaning and restoration services. I was confused. What exactly does that mean? Janet cleared her throat and said, well, when residents pass away, we have to thoroughly sanitize and restore their rooms for the next occupant. It's quite an extensive process. I asked for an itemized breakdown, thinking maybe they'd had to replace furniture or something. What I received in the mail two days later made my blood boil. The Bill included charges like Spiritual Cleansing Ceremony, $200, Sage burning and Negative Energy Removal, $150, Medium consultation to ensure peaceful transition, $300 and blessed water room purification, $75. But the most outrageous charge was one hundred twenty two dollars and fifty cents for exorcism services to remove Lingering presence, I called back immediately and asked to speak to a manager.

My siblings and I always joked about how none of us looked anything like our dad. It was just a silly family joke and we all laughed about it. But one day, our youngest sister saw a DNA test kit on sale, and she suggested we finally settle the question of who was really dad's kid. We thought it was funny, so we agreed to do it just for fun. None of us had any doubts or suspicions because we were sure it would just be a laugh. I'm the oldest of four siblings, two boys and two girls. My youngest sister had always been the favourite, and our parents worked hard to give us everything we needed, even when money was tight. We all took the DNA test while laughing the whole time, making dumb bets and teasing each other. Then we sent off the samples and forgot about it for a few weeks until my phone buzzed with the results. I opened the email expecting something funny, maybe even a confirmation that we were all just being dramatic. But my smile disappeared right away. Out of the four of us, only our youngest sister was actually related to our dad. At first, I thought it had to be a mistake. There was no way this could be real. I stared at the screen for a full minute before I even moved. My hands were shaking as I called my siblings Into the room and showed them the results. My brother said it had to be wrong and suggested we take another test. No one argued. We all needed to believe it was a fluke. So we did. We went to a different place for testing and waited nervously, each day dragging longer than the last. That second test felt heavier, like we were waiting for a sentence. When the second results came back the same, we knew our lives had changed forever. We went to our mom, hoping for answer.

Like, this girl could be a model, and I'm just some regular dude who works at an auto shop, but whatever. I figured I'd try to make a good impression. Her friends showed up around 2 p m, and right away I could tell they were the type who thought their shit didn't stink. Designer clothes, fancy cars, the whole deal. I'm out there grilling burgers in my regular jeans and a band T-shirt, trying to be friendly, asking if anyone wanted drinks or anything. That's when Amy started in on me. First it was about my hairline. Oh, Jake's going bald already, and he's only 24, she said while laughing with her friend Madison. I just stood there flipping burgers, pretending I didn't hear it, but my face was getting hot. Then she spotted my tattoo when I rolled up my sleeves. Yeah, his buddy Tyler gave him that masterpiece in his garage. Real professional work, right? The tattoo is pretty shitty, I'll admit that. But hearing her tear it apart in front of people who barely knew me was rough. When I grabbed a beer around 4 p m, she goes, better make it a light one. Jake's a total lightweight. He'll probably be passed out by 8:00. Her friends were eating this up, giggling like we were in middle school or something. The worst part came when one of her friends asked about my truck. Before I could even answer, Amy jumps in with, oh, that piece of junk? It barely runs. I keep telling him to get a real car, but you know how?

I spent two weeks quietly packing during lunch breaks, found a perfect place near the river, transferred my lease, changed my address with work, updated my voter registration, forwarded my mail, the whole nine yards. My parents and Jennifer had absolutely no idea. Great, I said, standing up and wiping barbecue sauce from my hands. You can drop them off at my place tomorrow morning around 9. I'll be completely ready. Jennifer's face lit up like Christmas morning. Really? Oh, my god, thank you so much. I knew you'd come through for family. Mom started tearing up. You're such a good sister, Laura. I gave them my old address with a straight face. You know, the completely empty apartment I'd already vacated, the one with the bright for rent sign posted in the front window. That night, I turned off my phone completely and enjoyed my first peaceful evening in my beautiful new place. I ordered pizza, unpacked my last moving box, and watch Netflix without any guilt or interruptions. The next morning, Jennifer showed up at my old apartment complex with three enormous duffel bags, car seats, toys, snacks, and a huge, excited smile. She knocked on the door for 10 solid minutes before my former landlord, Mister Peterson, came out. Can I help you with something? He asked. Lately, I'm looking for Laura Mitchell, she said, balancing four year old Sophie on her hip. While Emma and Jake ran circles around the parking lot screaming, oh, she moved out two weeks ago. Nice girl. This unit is available if you're interested in renting it. My phone started absolute we blowing up around noon when Jennifer finally made it back home with three confused, cranky kids. 12 missed calls, 37 increasingly frantic text messages. Where the hell are you? What kind of sick joke is this?

You won't mind, will you? They smiled like it was already decided. My sister Jennifer sat there twirling her hair, scrolling through dating apps, not even looking at me, while her three kids demolished my parents living room. It's just temporary, mom said, cutting her steak like we were discussing weekend plans, until David gets comfortable with kids being around. So let me get this straight. Jennifer wants to hide her three children from her new boyfriend, dump them with me for months, and I'm supposed to pay for daycare while she plays house? You don't understand what sacrifice means. Dad jumped in, waving his fork. Dramatic. Automatically, Jennifer's given up everything for those kids. The audacity was absolutely unreal. Jennifer had been pawning her kids off on everyone for years. Last month she dropped them at our cousin's wedding reception and disappeared for the entire party. The month before that, she left them with our 80 year old neighbor, Missus Chen, while she went clubbing until 3:00am. Two months ago, she dumped them on me for a girls weekend that turned into five days. I nodded and kept eating my ribs and calm. Sounds like you've got it all figured out. The thing is, Jennifer finally looked up from her phone, eyes sparkling with greed. David's got serious money. Like country club money. I already Told him I don't have kids yet. Just need a few months to ease him into the idea of family life. And you'll somehow manage Emma J. And Sophie during the day while you're working full time? Mom asked me directly. Like I wasn't even there to speak for myself. Oh, I figured Laura could find a babysitter. Jennifer shrugged casually. I'll be pretty tight on cash with David moving in. His place is expensive to maintain, so I'd be paying for full time childcare for kids that aren't.

Growing up, there was just one rule in our family, blood is thicker than water. It was drilled into us at every family gathering. We had these massive Sunday dinners at my grandparents house every month with like 30 people showing up. And every single time someone would ask where cousin Jamie was, the answer was always the same. Oh, you know, Jamie, always working. I was 28 when I ran into Jamie at the grocery store. First time I've seen her in 13 years. She went completely pale when she saw me and tried to leave, but I grabbed her arm and insisted we get coffee. I mentioned how my five year old daughter loved art just like Jamie used to. That's when she broke down. She grabbed my hands and begged me to never let my daughter near the family gatherings. Then she just ran out before I could ask why. I couldn't stop thinking about it, started noticing things I never paid attention to before. Old family photos on my, my mom's mental had weird gaps where someone had been cropped out. Jamie's name never came up in stories about the old days. When I asked my mom about it, she got all defensive and said Jamie made her choice to abandon the family. But that didn't make sense because I remember for Jamie being the star student with a full scholarship to art. School. Then Uncle Rob got drunk at my parents anniversary party and let something slip. He said Jamie destroyed our family with her lies. My mom shut him up real quick, but I saw the look they exchange. I found Jamie on social media and begged her to tell me what happened. She didn't want to at first, but when I sent her a picture of my daughter, she finally agreed to meet. We sat in her car outside of Starbucks and she told me everything. Uncle Mark had been molesting her since she was 8 years old. Uncle Mark, who everyone loved. Uncle Mark, who was my grandparents golden child. She finally told her parents when she was 15 and they called a family meeting. My grandparents accused her of trying to destroy the family, said blood is thicker than water and she needed to think about what she was doing to everyone. Her own mother coached her, take it back, asked if ruining everyone's lives was worth it. The worst part was that other cousins had come forward privately and admitted it happened to them too. But they were too scared of losing the family to say anything publicly. When Jamie refused to recant, they branded her a liar and an attention seeker. They literally erased her from the family, removed her birthday from the calendar and edited her out of photos, told everyone she declined her scholarship and ran away. I remembered being 15 and my parents. Telling me Jamie was sick in the head, I believed them. Everything started clicking into place. Uncle Mark always volunteered for kid duty at gatherings. He'd offer to babysit my daughter. Last month, I discovered three other female cousins had mysteriously moved away over the years. Found my Aunt Sarah's number and called her. She confirmed her daughter was a victim, too, and the family forced them out when they wouldn't stay quiet. The thing that really got me was realizing Uncle Mark basically owned everyone. He paid for my grandparents medical care and had given loans to half the family for their businesses. My own parents had borrowed 50 thousand from him to save their house during the recession. That's when my daughter made a comment that made my blood run cold. She said Uncle Mark's games were weird. I found old home videos and sure enough, there he was, always positioned near the young girls, always finding reasons to be alone with them. The next family gathering, I showed up late and couldn't find my daughter anywhere. Panic started rising as I searched room after room. Then I saw Uncle Mark's study door was locked. I heard my daughter.

How did it go? I used to date these super loud guys who would flirt with waitresses and talk over everyone at dinner. After my last boyfriend made me cry in a Taco Bell parking lot because he was texting other girls, my co workers at the bank kept telling me I needed to try something different. They all kept pointing to Owen from I T. Mid thirties. Always wore these soft sweaters, never raised his voice at anyone. He was the guy who held doors open and offered gum to random people. Everyone loved him because he literally never said no to helping anyone with their computer problems. So after weeks of my friends bugging me about it, I asked him to grab coffee. He got this huge smile and said yes immediately. Our first few dates were like something straight out of a romance movie. He brought me daisies because I mentioned once that roses felt too fancy. He walked me home even though his car was parked the opposite direction. He texted me good morning and good night every single day without fail. But after about three weeks of dating, something started feeling weird. Not anything he did exactly, but what he didn't say. Like I realised he never talked about himself, ever. I would ask about his childhood and he'd smile and change the subject to asking about mine. When I asked about past relationships, he'd just say nothing. Worth remembering. And immediately asked me about my ex boyfriends. It wasn't sketchy exactly, just really empty. Then came the night I was supposed to meet his friends. We planned to meet at the sports bar downtown. I showed up on time, but only Owen was there. He seemed totally normal about it and said his friends had to cancel last minute. We just had a quiet dinner instead. But then it happened again the next week and again. Every time we were supposed to meet his friends or family, something would come up. When I finally asked him directly about his family, he just said they were complicated and left it at that. I started getting curious, so I decided to Google him. One night there was nothing. Like, weirdly nothing. No Facebook, no LinkedIn, no Instagram. I even tried searching his name with our city and his workplace. Nothing came up except basic work directory stuff. That seemed really strange for someone our age, so I decided to do something I'd never done before. The next time he came over, I waited until he was in the shower and opened his laptop. It wasn't even password protected, which should have been the first red flag, but what I found made my stomach drop. There were hundreds of folders on his desktop. Each one was labelled with a girl's name. Some had full names, some just first names. I opened a few of them randomly. Each folder had screenshots. Of social media posts, selfies, pictures from what looks like dating apps, even some photos that looks like they were taken without permission. Then I saw a folder with my name on it. I clicked it, and my hands started shaking. There were dozens of photos of me that I had never sent him. Some were screenshots from my social media, but others looked like they were taken through my apartment.

My ex wife gets our daughter Haley every weekend. And every weekend, Haley comes home with a brand new injury. Bruised lip, scraped knee, even a cracked rib once. But the court's only response has been, children need their mothers. last week I was getting ready to go pick her up when I got the call. It was her friend's mom. Haley's at my house in Woodbridge for a sleepover and her insulin pump just fell. We don't know what to do. Her blood sugar is at 450 and climbing. I felt my stomach drop through the floor. That number should never be above 180. Where's her backup insulin? I asked, already grabbing my keys. She doesn't have any with her. Your wife dropped her off and said everything was in the pump. My hands were shaking as I started my car. My ex always carried the backup insulin in her purse. She made a huge show of it during custody hearings. Moving. What a prepared mother she was. I called her immediately. She answered with casino noise in the background. Haley's pump failed. She needs insulin now. You're only 15 minutes from the sleepover house. Yes, yes, yes! I just hit an all time record. She responded, our daughter is dying. I yelled, you need to leave now! There was a pause. I can hear dealer voices in the background. I'm at the high roller table. I don't care. What table? I'm down $3,000. I need to win it back. I slammed my hand on the steering wheel, pushing 90 on the highway. Our daughter is going to die. I'm 45 minutes away. You're 15. Then call an ambulance. They don't carry insulin. You know this. Only her prescription pen works. It's in your purse. I'm in the middle of a hand. Give me 20 minutes. Sleepover. Mom texted me a photo at 12:15. Haley unconscious on their bathroom floor, her lips pale, vomit on her shirt. The text said she's over 500 now, barely responsive. I called my ex again, screaming. Now she's dying. Dying? Get in your car. Stop being dramatic and stop calling. You made me lose that hand. The dealer thought I was cheating with signals. That's another 500 gone because of you. I hung up and called 9 1 1, explaining everything through tears. They said they'd meet me there, but confirmed what I already knew. Paramedics can't administer insulin without the pen. When I finally screeched into their driveway at 12:00am, the ambulance was already there. Haley was on a stretcher, completely unconscious. The paramedic looked grim. Blood sugars too high for our meter to read. We need insulin immediately. My ex has it. She's coming. But she wasn't. Not for another 42 minutes. I tried calling the casino directly. My daughter is dying. My ex wife, Rachel Beckett, is at your high roller table. She has life saving medication. Please make her Leave. Sir, we can't force guests to leave for personal matters. It's not personal. A child is dying. I'm sorry, sir. The paramedics arrived. I begged them to call her, thinking medical professionals would get through. The lead paramedic tried. Ma'am, your daughter is in diabetic ketoacidosis. Her organs are shutting down. I heard her response through his phone. I'm her mother. I'll decide when it's serious enough to leave. When my ex finally strolled through the emergency room doors at 1:00am, her designer purse was over her shoulder, reeking of cigarette smoke and wine.

I'm deaf and lived my whole life thinking my apartment was this peaceful, quiet space. Boy, was I wrong. I'm 24 and got my own place about two years ago. Small, one bedroom, nothing fancy, but it was mine. I loved how calm everything felt. My cat pepper and I had our routines down. I'd make tea every morning, watch Netflix with subtitles, do my thing. But here's the weird part. I could never sleep through the night like ever. I'd fall asleep fine around 11, then wake up at 2:00am sweating and anxious and again at 4, sometimes 5:30. Every single night for months, I check my phone, look around the room, everything seemed normal, but my heart would be racing like I just run a Marathon. My doctor said it was probably anxiety, prescribed me some sleep aids. That didn't do anything. My therapist thought maybe I had some deep childhood trauma, trauma messing with my sleep. We spent weeks talking about my past, but nothing clicked. It didn't feel like nightmares or panic attacks. It felt like something was physically wrong with my space. My cousin Zoe came to visit last month. She's hearing and was gonna crash on my couch for the weekend. She works at this marketing firm downtown and needed a place to stay while her apartment got fumigated. We've been texting about it for weeks. So she shows up Friday night around 8 with her overnight bag and some Chinese takeout. We're eating and catching up, talking about her job, drama and my new position at the graphic design company. Everything's normal. Then around 10, she starts looking around my apartment. Weird. Yeah. How do you sleep here? She asks, making this disgusted face. I'm confused. I signed back asking what she means. My apartment's clean.

I spent three years invisible at my high school. Not the shy kid who sits alone, but the one nobody remembers exists. Teachers called me by the wrong name. Kids borrowed my notes then forgot who gave them. Even the lunch lady skipped my tray sometimes like I wasn't standing there. So when I overheard two popular girls planning the senior prank, something inside me snapped because I wanted to join, but because their idea was weak, they wanted to fill the principal's office with balloons. That's it, balloons. Like we were still in middle school. I knew I could do better, so I started planning something that would make everyone finally see me. First, I got Jake involved. He worked at his uncle's print shop and owed me for doing his chemistry homework all semester. I told him I needed 500 copies of something but couldn't say what yet. He agreed without questions because that's how desperate he was to pass. I talked to Emma from theater. She had keys to the costume room because she managed props. I told her I needed to borrow something for one night. She handed me the keys and said, just don't get caught. The hardest part was getting into the school database. But my computer science teacher, Mr Lopez, had been using the same password for three years, football 2,019. I knew because he typed it in front of us every morning when he Logged in two weeks before graduation. Everything was ready. I stayed after school pretending to work on yearbook layouts. When the building emptied out, I went to work. First, I logged into the announcement system and recorded a new morning message. Then I printed all 500 copies. Every single one was a different embarrassing photo from the principal's Facebook. Him doing carry okay. Him wearing a banana costume at Halloween. Him crying at his daughter's wedding. But that wasn't the best part. Using the theater supplies, I made a perfect replica of our school mascot costume, except this one had the principal's face printed on the head. I hung it from the main hallway ceiling with fishing wire so it would drop during morning announcements. The next morning, I sat in homeroom trying not to smile. At exactly 8:15, my recorded message started playing over the speakers, but it wasn't my voice.

I was home alone one evening when the doorbell camera notification pinged on my phone. A FedEx guy stood on my porch holding a small package. Nothing unusual, just didn't remember expecting a delivery. I answered through the speaker. Just leave it at the door. Thanks. I looked directly into the camera. I need a signature for this one, ma'am. Through the doorbell camera, I watched him shift his weight. It'll just take a second, he insisted. That's when I noticed he wasn't holding a scanner. FedEx always has those handheld devices for signatures. This guy's hands were empty, except for my package. Who's it from? I asked, buying time while pulling up the actual FedEx tracking site on my laptop. No delivery scheduled for today. It's marked urgent. He said. Medical supplies. My heart started racing. I don't have medical conditions requiring special deliveries, but, I mean, it's just in my head, right? The driver knocked again, harder this time. Ma'am, I can hear you moving around in there. I hadn't made a sound. I was sitting perfectly still on my couch, phone clutched in sweaty hands. How did he know I was home? I tell him he's got the wrong address. He says, no, this is the right one. I messaged my neighbor, Mark, an off duty cop, I claiming to be FedEx at my door. No truck, no scanner. Says he can hear me inside. What do I do? He said he's at a grocery store and is heading over. I called him and said what's going on and please hurry cause I was scared. The man outside started trying the doorknob, gently at first, then with more force. Mark said, I'm calling it in. Stay quiet, hide and lock yourself. He hung up. The delivery man set the package down and pulled something from his back pocket. Through the camera, I watched him unfolding what looked like locked

My mom had this absolutely insane rule, no music above whisper volume anywhere in the house, ever. Not in our bedrooms, not in the basement, not even with headphones if she could hear the faintest sound leaking from the hallway. We had to keep everything so quiet that my friends thought our house was like a library or a museum. My sister would literally hold her phone directly to her ear to listen to songs. I got in serious trouble once for humming the frozen soundtrack too loudly while doing homework. She made me sit in silence for an hour as punishment. This went on for 12 entire years, 12 years of basically living in complete silence like monks. Then my boyfriend came over for dinner last month. He asked if he could play some background music on his phone while we cook together. I automatically said, oh, no, absolutely not. We can't have music on in this house. He looked completely confused. Why not? It's just background music. I shrugged like it was obvious. Mom's rule, no music above whisper level anywhere in the house. He stared at me like I just said we weren't allowed to breathe oxygen. That's really weird and kind of concerning. Why would that be a rule? I realised I'd never actually questioned it in my entire life. We just accepted it as absolute fact, like gravity or paying taxes or for the sky being blue at dinner. He asked my mom. Directly, Missus Chen, can I ask why music isn't allowed in your house? I've never encountered this rule before. The whole table went completely quiet. We never questioned Mom's rules ever. That was just asking for trouble. Mom looked genuinely puzzled. What do you mean the no music rule? Why can't there be any music played in the house above whisper volume? Mom's face went completely blank. What no music rule? I don't have a no music rule, my sis.

When my daughter was 16, she got rear ended by a drunk driver while stopped at a red light. The guy was clearly wasted, failed three sobriety tests. But somehow his expensive lawyer was trying to blame my daughter for the accident. The crash left her with a concussion and whiplash. She he missed two weeks of school and had to quit her job at the local coffee shop because she couldn't handle the physical demands anymore. But this lawyer was determined to prove she was somehow at fault. During the deposition, he kept asking the same questions over and over, trying to confuse her or get her to contradict herself. My daughter has always been sharp, but head injuries can affect your memory. So I was worried about how she'd handle his aggressive tactics. The lawyer starts with this condescending tone. Now, Miss Johnson, you claim you were completely stopped at the intersection, correct? Yes, sir. The light was red. But how can you be absolutely certain you were stopped? Isn't it possible you were still slowing down? Because my car has something called brakes and I use them. The stenographer smiled, but the lawyer wasn't amused. He kept pushing. You were on your phone at the time of the accident, weren't you? No, I wasn't. Come now, you're a teenager. All teenagers are on their phones constantly. Surely you were texting someone. I wasn't on my phone. I Find that very hard to believe. What teenager isn't on their phone while driving? That's when my daughter looked him dead in the eye and said, the kind whose parents actually taught her how to drive responsibly. Maybe if more adults acted like adults instead of getting drunk and driving into teen, we wouldn't need to have these conversations. The room went completely silent. The lawyer's face turned red, but he kept going. Let's talk about your alleged injuries. Concussions are very convenient because they're impossible to prove, aren't they? Actually, they showed up on my CT scan. But I'm not a doctor. Are you? I'm asking the questions here, young lady. Right. But you just asked me if concussions are impossible to prove. And I'm telling you mine was proven by medical imaging. So either you don't understand how CT scans and work or you're asking questions you already know the answers to just to waste everyone's time. Our lawyer was trying not to smile. The other guy was getting flustered. Miss Johnson, isn't it true that you've been milking these so called injuries for attention and to get out of school? Yes, because nothing says fun teenage experience like massive headaches, memory problems and having to quit the job I loved. I definitely gave myself a concussion just to miss my AP chemistry test. The sarcasm was thick and even and the court reporter was stifling a laugh. But the lawyer wasn't done. He pulled out a photo On his phone and showed it to her. This is a picture from your Instagram account posted 3 days after the accident. You're smiling. If you were really injured, would you be posting happy photos? My daughter looked at the photo, then back at him with this completely deadpan expression.

I replied, okay. When they tried to log into the company servers the next day, they realized the family business was built entirely on the code I had just revoked. I, 28, male, just got the most hilarious text from my brothers. After 5 years of building what they called the family business, they've decided to vote me out. My brothers, Garrett, 35, and Toby, 32, started a logistics company consulting firm in 2019. What they actually had was a fancy name, business cards and exactly zero clients. Six months in, they came crawling to me fresh out of college with a comp computer science degree. They needed someone to handle the website. What they actually needed was someone to build an entire automated system from scratch. Client portal, inventory tracking, route optimization, payment processing, the works. Took me 8 months of nights and weekends. They paid me in pizza and promises. Here's the thing, I never transferred ownership of the code. It's all licensed through my personal LLC. They I signed without reading because we're family. Fast forward five years, we're pulling in $2.8 million annually. My systems handle everything. They just shmooze clients and collect checks. Last week, things got interesting. Garrett's wife Mallory suddenly became operations director, a made up position where she reorganizes filing cabinets and changes email fonts. Toby's girlfriend Kelsey became social media manager for our B2 B company that doesn't even Need Instagram, both making DOLLAR85K annually, by the way. Meanwhile, I'm still maintaining every line of code, updating systems, handling server crashes at 2:00am, and taking my measly 20% cut as the tech guy. Yesterday at four PM, hey, we held a partners meeting and voted, you're out. The business needs to evolve beyond just tech stuff. Pack your desk by Friday, we'll mail your last check. Hey, thanks for everything, I replied. Okay. Then I did what any reasonable person would do. I logged into AWS and revoked every single license key for their software. All of it. The client portal, routing system, inventory management, payment processing, everything. Now it all shows one simple message, license expired. Please contact your software administrator. Garrett called me at four seventeen PM, then 4:19, then 4:12, missed call. By 4:30, I didn't answer any of them. The chaos that followed was honestly better than Netflix. Their biggest client had a 400,000 dollar shipment scheduled for the next morning. Without the routing system, they had no idea which drivers were supposed to go where the inventory system was down, so they couldn't figure out what was supposed to be. Garrett showed up at my apartment at 6:00am, pounding on the door like police. I recorded it through my ring doorbell but didn't answer. He screamed for 20 minutes about how I'm being petty and destroying the family business. My neighbor eventually threatened to call the cops, so he left. Then came the lawyer. Threats. Toby sent me this gem. Our attorney says what you did is illegal sabotage and corporate theft. You have.

I'm not running a restaurant. When I came home starving from a 14 hour shift. I'm 32, married to Linda, 29, for three years. She has two kids, Ryan, 11, and Sophie, 8. I work as a field technician with long days and emergency calls that keep me out until ten PM when we started dating, Linda worked full time. We'd split costs, take turns cooking, actual partnership. After marriage, she scaled back to freelance work. She brings in about $800 a month working 15 hours a week. I pay the mortgage, utilities, car payments and groceries. Yesterday was brutal. Equipment failures at three cell towers. I spent 14 hours crawling through equipment rooms and climbing towers in 95 degree heat. Uniform was soaked, my knees scraped and I hadn't eaten since lunch. When I walked into the kitchen, completely drained, Linda was cleaning up dinner dishes. I opened the fridge looking for leftovers, but there wasn't anything. Are there any leftovers from dinner, I asked. She didn't even look up. You're an adult cook for yourself. I stood there not sure I heard right. When I asked what she meant, she turned around annoyed. I made dinner for the kids at 6:00. You weren't here. I'm not running a restaurant where people can just show up whenever and expect food ready. I explained that I've been working since 6 a. M. And couldn't control when emergency calls ended. But She shrugged. That's your choice. The kids and I have our routine. You think I chose to work a 14 hour day? You chose that job. You chose the overtime. Don't.

Oh, it's my fault, right? My fault that you're gone. I'm in high school now. I understand now that you were insecure and I truly was a jerk. Brody died today. I read our texts and cried. Boys aren't supposed to cry. But you told me. It's okay. I love you. Do you still love me, too?

Okay, so you have an ex? Yes. And what is his. What is his name? Brian. Okay, and when did he become your ex? Like, how fresh is this? It was last year, but we still talk to each other all the time. Okay, so. But he's dating someone else now? Yes. And her name is Hannah, and she seems totally nice and everything. I know a few people who know her, too. They said she's super nice, and they seem happy together. But here's the thing. I keep telling her that Brian is doing things behind her back, and she keeps ignoring me when I try to help. Okay. Do. Doing what things behind her back? Talking to other girls, talking to me still, and trying to get me to actually hook up with him. So Brian is still trying to hook up with you even though he has a new girl? Pretty much. And I tried getting a message out to her, and she blocked me, so I just. Yeah. Oh, wow. Well, how did you try contacting her? Contacting her? Did you, like, DM her or something? Like, what'd you do? Yeah, I tried dming her through Instagram, but she blocked me right away. She told her friends not to talk to me either. She told them I was Brian's psycho ex. But really, truthfully, all I'm trying to do is help her here. Okay, so you're trying to be the nice person here so she doesn't get her heart broken like you did? Basically, yeah. Okay, but she won't listen to you. Probably cause Brian himself is probably been like, ah, she's my psycho ex, don't listen to her. I guess, yeah. Okay, yeah, but the whole thing is. Didn't you say Brian was still trying to hook up with you? Like he's still trying to get with you. I mean, we're supposed to be going out for drinks this weekend and he specifically told me not to mention it to anyone because of Hannah. Oh wow, that's shady. Okay, so. But she doesn't believe you. Well, alright, what if we did this? What if we got Brian on the phone, okay, and then also had this Hannah girl on listening, like on a third line. And then you sort of talked about hooking up or your little drinks date coming up. And then she'd be able to hear everything herself. That way you wouldn't have to convince anybody of anything cause she'd hear it for herself. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Okay. Alright, good. So it's an old fashioned Three Way call. We can set that up, no problem. Wait, do we have the other girl's number? Oh yeah, do we have. Yeah, This new Hannah Girls phone number. I have her number, yes. Oh, okay, well, there you go. Three Way. Action time it is. We'll do that when we come back. Next we're gonna do an old fashioned zoo morning zoo Three Way. But before we get to the actual call. And we're ready to go with this. Yes. Okay, so please welcome Hannah to the show. Hello, Hannah. Hello. So, shag talked to you already, right? We're on live. Watch the language, that sort of thing. Yes. Okay, so before we bring her on, Hannah, tell us what you know about Chantal, your current man. Brian's ex. Uh. Oh, boy. Um, not much. Just that they dated, they broke up, and she's sort of crazy, I guess. Oh, okay, let's bring Chantelle on real quick. So, Chantelle, before we do this, what did you want to say to Hannah? Just that I am not crazy, and I'm only trying to prevent you here from getting hurt. That's. That's it? That's really it? Okay, Hannah, I mean, if. Okay, if you're just trying to help me, then what was wrong with keeping all this private? Like, why do we have to do all of this on the radio? Because you won't answer me when I try to talk to you. You blocked me on Instagram, that's why. Yeah, I blocked you because Brian asked me to. He said he didn't want you spying on him. Well, like I said, I'm only. I'm only Trying to help you here. Okay, so listen, we came up with this idea here real quick. We wanted to call Brian up, and then. Chantelle, why don't you ask him about your supposed upcoming date that he made with you behind Hannah's back and see what he says? Fine with me. And Hannah. We're gonna turn your line down while she's talking to him, but you're still gonna get to hear everything that's being said. Okay? I mean, I just think this is really immature, but whatever. Okay, hang on, Chantal. We're gonna call him up here, and when he answers, you're on. Okay?

Unless you're trying to have your picture on the back of a milk carton and had your Facebook profile become a memorial page, I don't recommend it. I fucked around one time accidentally did that and I was tasting colors and speaking in cursive for two weeks. Y'all don't play around with these women like that. They're a whole different breed these days. Her and her two best friends will dispose of your body and then actually go help the search party look for you. And then she will go on the news and in front of God, your mom and the whole world will say how much she misses you and how bad she wants you home. Just know that 92.7% of women, give or take 1% either way, listen to true crime podcast or they watch true crime documentaries on TV and it's for a reason. Y'all can fuck around and find out.

So I moved across the country for my dream job. But six months later, she showed up at my door, saying, I'm ready to commit now, because distance doesn't matter when it's real love. And I laughed before introducing her to my new fiance, who was cooking dinner in our kitchen. I'm Marcus, 26, and when Jess dumped me six months ago, she said I was emotionally unavailable and socially stunted. Her exact words. You hide behind your work and can't form real connections. I need someone who actually has friends and knows how to be vulnerable. This happened right after I got accepted to my dream veterinary residency in Denver. We've been together two years, and I thought we were solid. I was planning to propose that Christmas, even had the ring picked out. The breakup destroyed me. I spent three days eating cereal in bed, questioning everything. Was I really that disconnected? Maybe she was right. Maybe I was just using her as a placeholder while focusing on my career. But I'd committed to the residency. So I packed up and drove to Denver with just my clothes, textbook, and a broken heart. If I was going to be miserable, at least I'd do something I loved. The animal hospital was this busy emergency clinic downtown. Doctor Peterson put me on 12 hour Shifts immediately. I was so exhausted learning new procedures that I barely thought about Jess. Something unexpected happened, though. My colleague Mike kept inviting me to trivia night at this bar. I made excuses. Too tired, had studying. But Mike was persistent, and I finally gave in just to shut him up. Trivia night was actually fun. Mike's team called themselves the Possum 4 and competed against other medical professionals. I was weirdly good at Animal Facts, making me valuable for the first time in months. I was laughing and genuinely enjoying people's company. Mike introduced me to his hiking group. Outdoorsy medical people doing weekend trails around Colorado. I'd always loved nature, but never had anyone to explore with. Suddenly, I was spending Saturdays climbing mountains and having real conversations with people, but who weren't Jess. Then I started volunteering at the city animal shelter on days off. They needed someone with medical training for health assessments. That's where I met Diana. She was the shelter coordinator. This amazing woman who knew every single animal's personality and hit

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the centre of attention for 5 minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance, Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day, the one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding, I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up, he said. And I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself and I just can't deal with that stress on my wedding day. The line went quiet for like 10 seconds. Then Jake exploded. Are you serious right now you're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. He's basically family. I tried. To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice, hoping he'd change his mind. He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, she says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted like 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewellery. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today with a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. He's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done, and I have to deal with.

So I got the perfect revenge. She crashed our cabin weekend claiming her Airbnb fell through. I knew it was BS the moment she showed up with a perfectly packed bag and a smug smile. My boyfriend Joseph felt bad for her and invited her to stay without even asking me. For three days straight, she kept creating these elaborate situations to make me look like the worst girlfriend ever. Like when she helped make dinner on Friday night. She volunteered to preheat the oven while I prepped ingredients. Everything seemed normal until I put our carefully marinated steaks in and they came out completely charred. She acted shocked when Joseph got mad at me for ruining our expensive dinner. Later, I noticed she'd secretly cranked the oven to 500 degrees. Saturday morning, she suggested we go hiking to this amazing waterfall she'd been to before. She gave me detailed directions to the trailhead while she rode with Joseph. Turns out she sent me to the wrong trail entirely. I spent two hours lost in the woods with no cell service while they bonded over waiting for me. When I finally found them at the actual trailhead, Joseph was visibly annoyed I'd kept them waiting. She just shrugged and said, oh, I guess I mixed up the directions. My bad. The manipulation got worse as the weekend went on. She kept doing this thing where she'd bring up inside jokes and memories from before I existed, making make me feel like an outsider in my own relationship. Remember when we did this? And remember when we did that? Always with this little smile directed at me. She'd also accidentally brush against Joe Joseph, constantly grab his arm when laughing, and find excuses to lean over him. During Saturday afternoon, we decided to go swimming in the lake. She conveniently forgot to pack a swimsuit and asked to borrow one of mine. The one she picked was my smallest bikini, and she made sure to comment loudly about how loose it was on her while adjusting it right in front of Joseph. Then she suggested we play volleyball in the water and kept accidentally bumping into me, making me lose my balance. Breaking point was Saturday night. We were all sitting by the fire when she pretended to be drunk and started crying about how much she missed the old days before I came along and changed everything. She was literally sobbing into Joseph's shoulder.

The courtroom erupted until I stood, handed the judge a two page document and said, check again. Judge simply looked at my wife and burst out laughing. My name is James and three months ago I caught my wife Lauren cheating with her yoga instructor, filed for divorce immediately thinking she'd hit the Jackpot. Since we've been married for five years, Lauren strutted into that Phoenix courtroom wearing a two thousand dollar dress I'd bought her. Confident as hell her lawyer was already calculating his commission on what they thought would be a four million dollar payout for my construction business and dad's inheritance. The whole courtroom was packed. Lauren had actually invited some of her friends to watch what she called James's comeuppance. She been telling everyone for weeks how she was about to become independently wealthy. Your honor, her attorney announced, adjusting his expensive tie. Mrs. Peterson deserves substantial compensation for supporting her husband's career growth during their five year marriage. Lauren actually winked at me from across the room. She thought I was just some heartbroken guy who'd roll over and pay whatever she demanded. Her friends in the gallery were practically grinning waiting for the show. But here's what Lauren didn't know. Six months before I caught her cheating, I'd started noticing weird charges on our joint credit card, expensive dinners at restaurants I'd never been to, hotel rooms Booked during girls trips that didn't add up, designer lingerie, purchases that never made it home. The final straw was when I found an 800 dollar charge at a jewelry store downtown. When I asked Lauren about it, she said she'd bought herself a birthday present. Problem was her birthday wasn't for four months. So I hired a private investigator named Frank. Best $5,000 I ever spent. Frank followed Lauren for six weeks. What he discovered was worse than I imagined. The yoga instructor was just the latest in a long line of a there's. There was also her personal trainer, a bartender from her favorite restaurant, and even one of my own business partners. Lauren had been using our joint accounts to fund these relationships, expensive gifts, romantic getaways, been paying for her affairs, gym memberships. She'd blown through nearly $50,000 of our money over two years. The two page document I handed Judge Ramirez wasn't financial records. It Frank's detailed investigation report proving Lauren had been having multiple affairs for over two years, complete with time stamped photos, hotel receipts, restaurant bills and screenshots of explicit text messages. Messages in Arizona, adultery doesn't automatically disqualify you from alimony, but it sure does when you've been systematically draining marital assets to fund your affairs. It's called waste of marital property and it's a big deal in divorce court. The judge read the first page slowly, his eyebrows climbing higher with each line. He flipped to page 2, studied the Photos and then burst out laughing so hard his.

So my wife, Emma, came home last Tuesday with that look on her face, the one all guilty and nervous like she just got caught stealing candy. She sat me down on our ratty old couch and started crying before she even said anything. Turns out she'd been hooking up with her coworker Jake for like three months. Three months while I was working double shifts at the warehouse to save up for our anniversary trip to Florida. She kept saying sorry over and over, begging me not to leave her, promising she'd cut all contact with this guy. I just sat there staring at our wedding photo on the coffee table, the one where we're both laughing because my cousin Rick photobombed us making bunny ears. We looked so happy, so stupid. Emma grabbed my hands and asked if I could ever forgive her. And here's where I became a complete psychopath. I looked her dead in the eyes and said yes. I told her we could work through this, that our marriage was stronger than one mistake, all that bullshit you see in movies. But I was lying through my teeth. The next morning, I called in sick to work and drove straight to Jake's apartment, found his address through Emma's Instagram. She tagged him at some restaurant last month. Dude answered the door in his boxers looking all confused. Introduce myself as Emma's husband and Watched his face go white. Then I very calmly explained that I knew everything and that he had exactly 24 hours to quit his job and move out of town or I'd be paying visits to his parents, his ex girlfriend Sarah, who he was apparently trying to win back, and his boss, who definitely didn't know he was screwing around with married co workers. Jake started stuttering about how sorry he was, how it meant nothing. I just smiled and handed him a printed email I'd already drafted to his entire office explaining the situation, told him this would be sent if he wasn't gone by Thursday. Me while at home, I was being the perfect forgiveness husband, made Emma her favorite pasta dinner, bought her flowers, even suggested couples therapy. She was so relieved and grateful, kept telling me how lucky she was to have such an understanding husband. Thursday came and Jake was gone. Just like that, Emma came home from work all confused because apparently he'd quit without notice and moved back to Ohio or something. She kept asking why he'd just disappear like that. I waited exactly one more week, let her think we were rebuilding our trust. Then last Friday, I casually mentioned over breakfast that I'd changed my mind about the whole forgiveness thing. Her face went from confused to terrified in about two seconds. I told her I'd known.

Everyone laughed except me. I quietly raised my hot dog and said, challenge accepted. That night, I packed everything into two suitcases and left my key on the kitchen counter. No, no, no. Goodbye. Just gone. I've been the family doormat for 29 years, the one who organised every holiday, baked every birthday cake, and cleaned up everyone's messes while they took selfies without me. So when mom made that joke at our B B Q with my aunts and siblings all laughing, something inside me just clicked. I moved three hours away to a lakeside cabin, blocked everyone's numbers, and started over as Jade instead of JD, the nickname that made me feel like a child. For the first week, my phone stayed silent, exactly like mom predicted. But week two 2. My brother called 47 times. Turns out nobody knew how to work the washing machine I've been maintaining for years. Their clothes piled up like a laundry mountain until he finally had to buy new underwear instead of figuring out the spin cycle. Week 3, my sister showed up at my old job crying, begging my former co workers for my new number. She had a family emergency, aka couldn't figure out how to renew her car registration. The same registration I've been handling for her since she was 16. My coworkers Told her I'd moved states away. She broke down in the parking lot because she'd never even Learned where the DMV was located. She ended up paying $300 to some sketchy guy who promised to handle it. Month 2, dad drove to every apartment complex in the city looking for me. He never realised I was the one who remembered everyone's medication schedules, grocery lists, and which bills were due. When without me, he missed his blood pressure medication for three weeks and had to go to urgent care. The doctor asked if he had family support at home. Dad just stared at the floor and mumbled something about his daughter being away. Mom had a complete breakdown when she realized I've been handling all the family birthdays, anniversary reminders, and doctor appointments for decades. She forgot her own.

Your mom called me asking if I knew where you were. I told her you were in my house, in the bathroom, just to cover for you. But seriously, where are you? It's been a day now. Elio. Your mom's freaking out, and honestly, so am I. She called the police. I haven't told them that I lied for you. I keep telling her you're here, but I have no idea where you are. Please come home. I'm getting really worried. I asked my FA favorite astrology app, Astro App, for advice and it said that I'm a cancer, so I can get really emotional when I feel abandoned. It told me to take deep breaths and focus on grounding myself so I can stay calm and clear minded while waiting to hear from you. Elio, it's been a week. Everyone saying you're missing. Like actually missing. Your mom's been crying non stop and they filed a police report. Where are you? What's going on, Ello? It's been a month now. They still can't find you. I don't even know what to tell people anymore. I got a cat to help with the loneliness, I guess. I named him Charlie. Figured you'd like that. Wish you could see him. She's really sweet. Sleeps with me every night. She and was born on Valentine's Day too. Hahaha. It's been two months since you disappeared. I stopped writing to you because it felt like screaming into the void. Your mom's pregnant. Can you believe that? Guess there'll be another Elio around soon. I miss you so much, Elio. 10 months now. Your sister's almost here. Her name is going to be Julia. I keep hoping you'll walk through the door before she's born. Ello, it's been two years. I know that sounds insane, but part of me still thinks you're coming back. I can't move on from this. Everyone tells me to, but I can't. It's like a piece of me went missing with you. Hey. I need to tell you this. I'm getting married. I found someone who loves me. I think you'd like him. He's the love of my life. And I'm finally getting married. I asked for star rings so you'd be here with me in some way. I miss you more than ever right now. Ilio. It's been five years. I don't know what to say anymore. But I'm still here. They closed your case, the police. No one's looking for you anymore. But I'll never stop. I'm thinking of searching for you on my own, but in secret. Oh, and I'm pregnant. It's a boy. I'm naming him Elio, after you. Hey. Wow. I didn't even realize we're still having this conversation. It's been seven years. My son's been born. Look. I think he looks a bit like you. He's as cute as you were. Or maybe that's just me imagining things. Wish you could see him. Hey, Elio. It's been 11 years. He's turning four. Today. Time flies, doesn't it? Feels like yesterday when I last saw you. He really admires you, you know. I always tell him how great you were as a boyfriend. He says you're still alive, that we're so connected. That's why I feel like you're still around. But I don't know. Sometimes I lose faith in you coming back. I wonder if he's right. I still feel you somehow, Ello. It's been 14 years. My new boyfriend tells me I need to move on. Says I'm holding on too tight. But my son, he still believes you're coming back. He's only a kid, but he has more faith than I do by now. It's been 20 years, Elio. Wow. My boy's nine now. He's getting so big. And guess what? I'm pregnant again. With a girl. She's due in four months, and I'm naming her Jula. Like your sister. Speaking of, your sister moved back in with your parents. She's not doing well. She barely speaks to anyone. It's like everything fell apart when you left. Elio, it's been 25 years. I built the house we dreamed of. Remember that? I also got divorced, though. He cheated on me. Now it's just me, Elio, Julia and the cat. Still waiting for you, I guess. I miss you more than I can put into words, Elio. You have no idea. Every single day. Bria. The fuck you mean I died? I was just having some burger and fries. You're already planning My funeral. Chill. You can now check part two by pressing share. Then more.

Her mom let her have boys in her room with the door closed. I was jealous AF so I decided to run away. Now I wasn't completely stupid. I knew I couldn't just disappear forever. I was thinking like a 3 4 day protest to show my parents they were being unreasonable. Maybe they'd realise how much they missed me and stop being so strict. I packed a backpack with like the Absolute Essentials. Three t shirts, my favourite hoodie, a pair of jeans, some underwear, my school makeup bag, and like $43 I'd saved from Birthday money. I also took this silver necklace my grandma gave me that I thought I could maybe sell if I needed more cash. Teen logic lol. I waited until everyone was asleep, probably around 1:00am. Our house had this super creepy wooden hallway, I literally practiced walking through it for weeks before I ran away, finding exactly where to step to avoid making noise. I felt like a ninja that night, swear to god. The plan was to walk to this 24 hour convenience store about a mile away and call Charlotte to come get me. But here's where everything went sideways. Charlotte's phone was dead. Like completely off. No response. I tried calling her house phone. Yes, they still had one, but her dad answered and I panicked and hung up. So there I was, sitting outside the 7 11 at 2:00am, no ride, and starting to low key freak out. The guy working inside kept giving me weird looks through the window. I was just sitting on the curb trying to figure out what to do when this red sedan pulls up. There were two guys and a girl, probably college age. The girl rolled down her window and asked if I was okay. I must have looked pathetic AF because she immediately offered me a ride. Her name was Melissa and she seems super nice, telling me they were coming back from a party and could drop me somewhere. Now I know this sounds dumb Don't get in cars with strangers and all that. But teenage me was desperate. It was getting cold, and I figured having a girl there made it safer. Plus, Melissa had this really gentle voice and kept saying she just wanted to help. I told them I needed to get to Charlotte's house, but didn't have her exact address. Another brilliant part of my plan. The guys were talking quietly in the front seat while Melissa kept asking me questions. How old I was, why I was out so late, if my parents knew where I was. I started noticing we weren't going towards Charlotte's neighborhood at all. We were heading towards the highway when I pointed this out. The guy driving, Steve, I think, said they needed to make a quick stop first. That's when the alarm bells really started going off in my head. Melissa kept trying to keep me calm, saying they just needed to drop something off with a friend, and then they'd help me find Charlotte's house. But then the other guy, Benjamin

First, ravens and wolves work together to hunt, where ravens will fly around looking for prey, then flying back to the wolves, getting their attention and leading them to the animal they saw waiting for the kill and sharing the meal. Next, hermit crabs and an enemy basically team up together to survive. Since an enemy can't move fast, the crab will pick it up and equipped it on its shell. The enemy helps defend the crab with its stinging tentacles, while the crab gives it much faster transportation and also shares scraps of its food every time it eats. Next, coyotes and Badgers hunt together. Since coyotes are better at covering ground and Badgers are better underground. The coyote will chase the prey on land, and if it goes under, the badger will take over, leaving the prey with no options. Are ways to escape, sharing their meal. Finally, humans and wild dolphins in Brazil work together to catch fish. The dolphins will find a school of fish and herd them towards the fisherman. When the fish are close, the dolphin will slap the water with its tail, signalling the fisherman to cast the net, causing the fish to scatter and get disorientated so it's easier for the dolphins to catch, rewarding both of them.

First off, honey Badgers are extremely aggressive, where no matter what size you are, they will challenge you. Known to have an extremely strong bite force targeting your most vulnerable areas like your eyes, throat, or even your balls. But it doesn't stop there, as honey Badgers are pretty much mini tanks, doing things like fighting deadly snakes, passing out from the venom, then waking up to finish the job, ignoring pain and injuries, constantly fighting no matter what, or taking on multiple animals by itself. And even if you were to get a good bite off on a honey badger, they have extremely loose skin and will twist inside of their own body just to bite your face. So if you do somehow kill a honey badger, there's still no doubt it'll leave you mangled for life.

The first step is during mating season, where the male penguin will search the crowd looking for a female he likes. Once he has a crush, he'll remember their face going out on a mission looking for the most perfect pebble he can find. When searching, they try to look for ones that are smooth, shiny, have a flat surface, and are clean. Once they find the special rock, the penguin will carry it in their beak all the way back to their crush, where it all comes down to a moment of truth, at which the male penguin will simply walk up to the female and lay the stone down at her feet. If she doesn't pick up the rock, that means she's not interested or already taken, which can cause the male to panic, constantly dropping more pebbles hoping she changes her mind. Or sometimes their mate might see this and attack the other penguin. But on the other hand, if she does pick up the pebble, it's a yes. Where they will then spend the next few days building a nest together, then raising an entire family for months until they grow up continuously mating each other over and over again every single mating season.

Desperate, it shoved its head into a hollow log, but a loud snore nearly shattered its eardrums. Helpless, it covered its glowing tail with a leaf, thinking finally some peace. But a gust of wind blew the leaf away. All night, tossing, no sleep in sight. Frustrated, it dove into a muddy pond, tail first, hoping the MUD would block the light. Disaster almost struck, but with sheer effort, it pulled free. Thinking the plan worked, it realised the glow pierced the MUD, turning the forest into a glowing nightclub. Nearby, bugs thought it was partying. Thick MUD didn't help, almost grounded it. Then an idea struck, MUD on the eyes. Brilliant light blocked completely, but crash into a tree. Bruised, battered, sleepless, at last, it soaked its tail in the lake. Miracle, the glow finally died down. A whole night of chaos, peace at last back home. Just when it thought it could nap till sunrise, creepy cooing from the bushes, it hid in terror, realizing how precious its tail really was. No tail light, no way to shine. Helpless, it flew toward the moon to borrow some glow. Under moonlight, it, its tail shimmered pale blue, dazzling but not reliable on cloudy nights. Determined, it set course for the moon to bring back a piece of glowing moonlight. Dangerous, absolutely, 384,000 km away. Oxygen disappearing fast. It lost consciousness, plummeting at 10 kilometers per Second friction ignited its tail like a meteor, 3,000 degrees Celsius heat miracle rekindled the glow. Flapping frantically, it slowed its fall and returned safely to the forest. Finally, exhausted, it could rest. Even when the sun rose, that dazzling tail couldn't wake it. Victory at last.

Everyone knew Blake and Rosalie were going to last forever. Like, seriously, this guy had her military dad laughing so hard he choked. The first time they ever met, while the rest of us had never even heard him speak, Blake invented Random Flower Day, where once a month he'd show up with a bouquet of exotic flowers shipped from a different country around the world. Each time our girlfriends would literally use him as an example during every argument. This is what a real man looks like. He organized flash mobs for her birthday, Learned to cook her grandmother's recipes and treated Rosalie like it was her birthday every day. Then Rosalie's mom got diagnosed with Lupus and Blake didn't even hesitate. He switched to night shifts at his accounting firm so he could drive her mom to treatments during the day. He even sold his beloved motorcycle, the one he'd rebuilt with his dad, just to over the copays when Rosalie's family hit their insurance limit. While the rest of us were complaining about meeting our girlfriend's parents once a month, Blake was at every single family dinner, helping Rosalie's mother cook, helping her dad fix the roof, and teaching her little brother to drive. Three years in, Blake proposed. He got down on one knee at her favorite restaurant with her whole family there with her grandmother's ring he'd personally restored and gave This speech about how she saved him from being a workaholic with no purpose. Whole restaurant started clapping. Rosalie was crying so hard she could barely say yes. The wedding planning was insane. Blake handled everything. She got stressed about vendor calls, seating arrangements, dealing with her crazy aunt who demanded vegan options for everyone. The day finally came. It was a beautiful beach and packed with 300 guests. Rosalie looked incredible walking down that aisle. Her dad tearing up next to her and Blake standing at the altar with tears already running down his face. The efficient Blake's best friend went through all the traditional stuff, the readings, the vows. Rosalie went first and by the end, everyone was dabbing their eyes with tears. Then came the big moment. Do you, Blake, take Rosalie to be your lawfully wedded wife? The whole beach was silent. Everyone waiting for that enthusiastic yes we all expected. Blake looked at Rosalie for what felt like forever. Then he took a deep breath and said, clear as day. Two hours ago, I would have hoisted you up in the air and screamed yes, but now you disgust me and I never want to see you again in my life. He turned and walked away. Rosalie's face went from confused to horrified in about two seconds. Literally collapsed right there in her wedding dress. The best friend stood there with his mouth open. Blake's mom started running after him, screaming his name. Rosalie's bridesmaids. Rushed to her, trying to get her to breathe. The whole beach erupted. People were standing up shouting, asking what the hell just happened. Blake just kept walking, got to the car park where a cab was waiting for him and drove off. Nobody could make sense of it. His groomsmen were blowing up his phone, getting nothing. Rosalie had to be sedated.

Monica and I were getting married in 10 weeks. I was signing our wedding venue contract when she stopped me. We should date other people before we get married. The pen fell out of my hand. I laughed because I thought she was joking. I'm serious. It will make us stronger. She showed me an article on her phone about open relationships. She had saved it two months ago. Two months? She'd been planning this while I was planning our honeymoon. Her phone kept buzzing with texts. She grabbed it and smiled at whatever she was reading. She said we needed to explore ourselves before getting married. She said we'd be more confident in our choice. She even mentioned that her best friend Jenna, never took risks and had a boring life. The whole time she was talking, her phone kept lighting up with messages. Kept checking them while talking to me. Something was wrong here. Fine. If you think dating others will help us, let's do it. Her face lit up completely. She looked like she'd won something big. She immediately started texting someone back really fast. I could hear her nails clicking on the phone screen. She thought I would just wait at home while she dated other people. She had no idea what was about to happen. What? The first date night came. Monica spent three hours getting ready. She wore a brand new black dress she'd bought Just for tonight. Her coworker Kyle picked her up, and she practically ran to his car. Then Jenna called and asked if I wanted to get dinner. Monica said you guys are opening things up. She said quietly, yeah, she's with Kyle right now. Jenna went silent for a long time. I knew something was happening with them. At dinner, Jenna barely touched her food. Monica's been lying to me, too, she said. Remember her work conference last month? She never went. Her hands were shaking. How do you know? I saw her location on Find My Friends. She was at Kyle's apartment the whole weekend. When I asked her about the conference, she gave me all these fake details about sessions she attended. I reached over and touched her hand. She didn't pull away. We should keep this between us, I said. Don't tell anyone about the open relationship. Let Monica think everything's working perfectly. Jenna nodded. We need to document everything she's done. Get evidence. We were both angry and hurt. This was about justice. That night, I heard everything through our bedroom wall. Monica had brought Kyle back to our apartment. Every sound, every word, everything. She was completely oblivious that I could hear them. I texted Jenna, can I come over? Twenty minutes later, I was on her couch while she made us tea. She doesn't even realize you can hear, Jenna said about the noises. She's too caught up in Kyle to think about anything. Else, we spent hours planning how to expose Monica's lies. When I left at 4 a m, she gave me her spare key. In case you need to escape again. After that first week, Jenna and I met daily to collect evidence. Screenshots of Monica's fake conference receipts, photos from Kyle's social media that proved her lies. She'd bring me lunch when I forgot to eat during our planning sessions. Two sugars. No.

At one point, UA. Was flying high in the business. They had every MVP from every sport. Steph Jordan, Speith winning majors, Tom Brady winning Super Bowls, Cam Newton as the biggest star in the NFL with his own signature cleats that were doing numbers every week. They sponsored the Cubs were just making inroads everywhere. But the real business success was ignoring New York and LA and basically picking the other 48 flyover states that Nike and Adidas did not care about at all. They embrace hunting and rural lifestyle and youth sports and went so hard on their DNA, which was this click clack, really agro, really focused in football. Nike and Adidas strategy had always been going after teen athletes, under armour just went younger. They went after the ten year old athlete and every kid from five to 10 years old was wearing under armour because you know what, eventually 10 year olds become 13 years old and 17 years old and 25 year old. And I'm glad they were because look.

I worked in marketing for a long time at Nike across American football, American basketball, Nike women. You wanna know some of the craziest differences between athletes at the highest level in America and athletes on these global stages? In soccer, these Fools will actually wear the key colorway of all the latest soccer cleats and boots. I'm American. We call them cleats. The key colorway from a company is usually a bright color that they've LED with to try to stand out amongst the crowd. Nike's using this bright orange. A bright orange. And there's this pink here. Puma had this purple colorway. Adidas has this blue, red, white. Different combo. And in America, it's like pulling teeth trying to get American athletes to wear the latest and greatest in innovation in footwear. In American football, the favorite cleat of most football players is literally cleat made in 2014. And they go on eBay for like 500 bucks. Pros will literally wear them at the highest level.

He was top 10 in passing in the Big 12. But yesterday was just announced that Jake is transferring from BYU because he got suspended for violating the honor code. This is all happening because Jake has an ongoing lawsuit where a Jane Doe alleges that Jake hmm her and also strangled her, which of course is a very serious accusation in and of itself. But here's where things get pretty interesting and it's a lose lose for Jake. First and foremost, if he did do that and that story is true, he deserves everything that's coming to him. But Jake is saying that he did not hmm her and everything that they did was 100% consensual. But because he is saying that it was consensual, he is admitting to having premarital activities, which is a direct violation of BYU's Code of honor because Mormon though on top of the ongoing lawsuit that's happening, he's also getting suspended from BYU because he admitted to having these premarital activities. Apparently, this all happened in November of 2023 and then in February of 2024, they were exchanging like hearted.

But he gives this guy a right hook for no reason and started randomly assaulting this other guy, in which, after the fact, he starts flexing and says that I don't fucking lose. And that viral video was even liked by Lamar Jackson. But NFL fans really didn't like this move, so they decided to ruin this guy's life. They first found his Facebook page, where it listed his job. And once that happened, everyone else started chiming in with their stories about it, like this guy saying, I knew this kid throughout high school. He's a total piece of shit. Got kicked out of three different Baltimore private schools. And a notable moment was his expulsion from Saint Paul's for putting his hmm. On a kid with special needs. He's disgusting, but his father's absolutely loaded, super rich. His expulsion story should tell you all you need to know. But it gets so Much worse, he was once on probation for a misdemeanor.

If you don't know who this man is, this is CJ Gardner Johnson and he is The Super Bowl champion. And for what it's worth, CJ GJJ here is a bit of a shit talker. He continued that trend on Sunday night when he posted this to his Instagram story. A picture with him talking shit to Travis Kelce with the caption should have stayed with that thick shit. This is CJ referring to Travis's ex girlfriend, who is obviously not Taylor Swift, implying that Taylor Swift was the reason they lost or something like that. And if there's one thing that you should know about Swifties, they take Taylor very seriously. So all these Taylor Swift fans saw that he was talking trash about their favorite girl, their goddess. They somehow found out that oh CJ Gigi's mom owns King's Grill, a restaurant, and therefore Swifties and Chiefs fans started bombarding your Google reviews. Worst food and service of my life. The chicken was raw. They should close down for putting people's lives at risk. I mean, just an absolute onslaught of one star reviews ultimately trying to destroy the reputation of CJ GJJ's mom's restaurant. Now thankfully, Google and you.

So this man right here is Shamar Stewart from Texas a M. He was drafted 17th overall by the Bengals this year. But Shamar here is the only first round pick to not have signed his rookie contract yet because the Bengals are trying to shaft him. this dispute happening with Shamar in the Bengals isn't about money. He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term, they can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team and he's actually been practicing with Texas a m. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL cause 1, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible, but not like.

He was top 10 in passing in the Big 12. But yesterday was just announced that Jake is transferring from BYU because he got suspended for violating the honor code. This is all happening because Jake has an ongoing lawsuit where a Jane Doe alleges that Jake hmm her and also strangled her, which, of course, is a very serious accusation in and of itself. But here's where things get pretty interesting, and it's a lose lose for Jake. First and foremost, if he did do that, and that story is true, he deserves everything that's coming to him. But Jake is saying that he did not hmm her, and everything that they did was 100% consensual. But because he is saying that it was consensual, he is admitting to having premarital activities, which is a direct violation of BYU's Code of honor because Mormon. Though on top of the ongoing lawsuit that's happening, he's also getting suspended from BYU because he admitted to having these premarital activities. Apparently, this all happened in November of 2023 and then in February of 2020.

You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt and then third string they got Trey Lance.

And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL because 1, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible but not likely. No. 2, he could ask for a.

I worked in marketing for a long time at Nike across American football, American basketball, Nike women. You wanna know some of the craziest differences between athletes at the highest level in America and athletes on these global stages? In soccer, these Fools will actually wear the key colorway of all the latest soccer cleats and boots. I'm American. We call cleats. The key colorway from a company is usually a bright color that they've LED with to try to stand out amongst the crowd. Nike's using this bright orange, a bright orange, and there's this pink here. Puma had this purple colorway. Adidas has this blue, red, white, different combo. And in America, it's like pulling teeth trying to get American athletes to wear the latest and greatest in innovation in footwear. In American football, the favorite cleat of most football players is literally cleat made in 2014 and they go on eBay for like 500 bucks. Pros will literally wear them at the highest level.

At one point UA was flying high in the business. They had every MVP from every sport. Steph Jordan Speith winning majors, Tom Brady winning Super Bowls, Cam Newton as the biggest star in the NFL with his own signature cleats that were doing numbers every week. They sponsored the Cubs were just making inroads everywhere. But the real business success was ignoring New York and LA and basically picking the other 48 flyover states that Nike and Adidas did not care about at all. They embrace hunting and rural lifestyle and youth sports and went so hard on their DNA which was this click clack, really Agro, really focused in football. While Nike and Adidas strategy had always been going after teen athletes, under armour just went younger. They went after the 10 year old athlete.

And the Netflix documentary they make on this guy is gonna win, like, five Academy Awards if you don't know what the hell I'm talking about. This guy's name is Nico Eamali. Last year, Nico played for Tennessee, which is one of the best teams in the SEC. And this guy actually LED Tennessee to the College Football Playoffs. They were 10 and 3, and they lost in the first round. But at the end of last season, Nico wanted about $4 million in nil money, even though he was already slatted to make about 2.2 million a year. And mind you, this kid had Tennessee by the balls. He was gonna be their starting quarterback for the next two years. But for whatever reason, he transferred to UCLA out of the SEC for less money. And as you can imagine, Tennessee fans were pissed. So Nico thought the grass would be a whole lot greener at UCLA. Well, come to find out, it's not, because UCLA is now 0 and 3 to start the season. And they got blown out last night by New Mexico, who they paid $1.2 million to play. Which was at home, by the way. And this is what the crowd looked like. There's nobody there. Meanwhile.

Malavea had a holdout because he wanted more nil money. And it was just reported this morning that Tennessee is gonna be moving on from the guy. So basically, here's what's happening. This year, Nico was slated to make $2.4 million from Tennessee's collective, but apparently that wasn't enough for Nico and he saw Carson Beck go from Georgia to Florida and he's getting 4 million. So basically stopped showing up to practice and meetings and was holding out hoping that Tennessee would give him $4 million. Long story short, Tennessee said no. I mean, to be fair, Nico, like Tennessee's mascot is the volunteers. He kind of knew what you signed up for. All jokes aside, though, this is kind of an insane move. And to me, the only logical explanation behind this is that Nico's camp just thinks he's not gonna succeed in the NFL, so they're trying to get him as much money as possible, right?

Now, during this game, Georgia had a pretty big play. The guys running down the sidelines. But guess who was celebrating while he was running down the sidelines? Parker Jones. Now, for those of you who don't know football rules, this little white line here is reserved for the referee and the referee only. And right here is where all the players should be. And when a big play like this happens, the ref is running down that white strip. And a lot of the time, if players get close to that white strip, the refs will issue a warning to the sideline. But this time, Parker got in the way of the ref and actually made contact with him, which caused the ref to throw a penalty flag on Parker Jones in the sideline, costing Georgia 15 yards. And now millions of people are blaming this guy for Georgia losing the Sugar Bowl. They're using him as a scapegoat to just cope with the fact that Georgia didn't play well enough to win the game. Was it stupid? Absolutely. You gotta be.

So yesterday, Pat and Brittany just came out saying they had their third kid and they named her Golden Ray. Golden Ray Mahomes, not bad. And while it's definitely not a bad name, a lot of people were confused why they would name her golden. This is because Pat and Brittany have some naming system where they name all of their children and dogs after metals. They first had Sterling, then their son bronze, whose legal name is actually Patrick Mahomes the third, and now golden. But come to find out that this tradition all started in college when Pat got Brittany a dog and named it steel after the Steelers. So when you really think about it, this whole naming tradition of a hall of Fame quarterback came from the Steelers. So they have a dog named steel, then they got another dog, named it silver, and they just said, shit, I love metal. And now their three kids are also named after metal. But now I know what you're thinking. Why would you ever call your son bronze as his other name? That's third place, man. That's not good Juju. Yeah, well, you'll never guess who came up with that name. And just as we all ex.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you wanna know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by four and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to Cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of him. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sits At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the snaps,

No. 1, gonna go with left tackle. There's a very clear reason these guys are paid so much in the NFL. Protecting the quarterback's blindside is the most important thing you can do on offense. You can't protect your quarterback. Your offense is done. Without offense, you're gonna be a pretty bad team. To put this in perspective, let's go on the flip side. Defensive ends, if they get a couple sacks a year, they're great. But an o tackle, if he gives up a couple sacks, he's trash. That tackles really can't afford to mess up because their team is riding on them. No.2, I'm gonna go corner. To play corner, you have to be one of the most gifted players on the field. He's an athletic freak. Not only do you just have to be fast, you have to be quick, nimble and willing to hit. Going out there every play and guarding Ryan Williams or Jeremiah Smith is no joke. Sometimes you're gonna do that with absolutely no help. It's not even fair. Yes, the great corners can do it, but cut the rest some slack. Corners hard. No. 3 is quarterback, the hardest position in football. Not only you have to master your offensive playbook, you have to master the defenses game plan every single week. You have to know what front they're running, what coverage When they're switching, when they're rolling, when they're blitzing.

Let's go and get the video popping. Let's go, man! Coming in at No. 1. For starters, bro, the chin strap is poor quality. Can't lie bro, as much as it is straight up cool to zip up your chin strap, I can't lie bro, this helmet is lacking some of the sturdiness and durability when it comes to the chin strap. With this chin strap bro, you really don't have the capabilities of changing it either. Like bro, you're literally stuck with this chin strap for good the whole entire season and don't even try to adjust this chin strap because the more you try to adjust it, the worse it gets bro. Honestly bro, when you first get a speed flex, it might be cool to have up that zip up feature when it comes to the chin strap, but over the course of time. Bro, the wear and tear on this chin strap is insane. don't even get me started on trying to take this chin strap off. Good luck. You're better off just getting a new helmet at that point. Just dealing with these screws at the top. Coming in at number two. We have the weight I'm not gonna lie brother, speed flex is a heavy ass helmet. Bro. Honestly bro, I. Could you not? Bro, trying to break this helmet in is insane. Do you literally feel like you're wearing a bobble head at that point? Bro, imagine trying to get in a 3 point.

Last year we had the Forty Niners and the Chiefs. The red for the Forty Niners and the purple for Taylor Swift, because she was the main topic at this time. And this year we have the Chiefs and the Eagles. The red for the Chiefs and the green for the Eagles. So it happened four years in a row, but now next year we have this. We have this right here. And what two teams do you think these are? And I'm not gonna lie to you guys, I see a lot of blue here. I see a blue on blue match up. The only thing that's throwing me off is this little San Francisco bridge and background right here. But even with that, I think the Super Bowl only has one answer. And that is the Buffalo Bills versus the Detroit Lions. Blue versus blue. This could finally be the Super Bowl that everyone wants. You get Josh Allen versus Jared got. This would be electric. If you guys do want free money on this year's big game, make sure You sign up for Underdog Fantasy Better and Sleeper Code NFL Combo when he's my code in these apps, you'll get $1,000. Sign up on his Palm Homes at a half yard and so many other discounts. Don't miss out. But either way, this is absolutely insane. And we know the theory is.

Beginning at No. 2, if you're going to get cheap turf tape, bro, expect it not to stay on your arms. if you're gonna get turf tape, bro, please get a name brand. Once you fall into the category of getting generic turf tape, bro, as soon as you hit the turf, it's already gonna be coming off your arms, which means you gotta reapply turf tape every time you hit the ground, bro, which is extremely annoying.

Kansas City football player Xavier Worthy found out that his girlfriend was cheating on him two weeks ago. For two weeks, he tried to get her to leave his crib. She was not going. When told to leave again, she got physical. Ripped out his dreads, destroyed his crib. A man's had a join, Taper, Fade Nation. But he went to jail because she decided to lie to police and claim that he grabbed up. It was proven false due to witnesses stating that he never did that, which is why they dropped the charges. But in the midst of his arrest, you already seen how social media was going. Quit to jump on the slide, quit to say he did it. Trying to ruin that man career.

He wanted three cars for his family members, a personal driver with a Cadillac SUV for Micah for spring practice through the end of the season. Like really, they just gave you all that money? You can't hire your own personal driver or drive your own car anyway. He also wanted his family's hotel and travel cost covered for all of the 10 games and he wanted medical injury time off after playing to be determined by him and his family. He was asking for a lot to be at A&M and three months later he's hitting the portal again. It's just crazy. This is gonna be a second transfer this offseason, but who knows? Maybe he goes back to Texas Tech. We'll see. I remember last month hearing about him taking a leave of ABS.

And then you add the best player in the world in Kylian Mbappe. Say what you want about Kevin Durant, I'll probably agree with you, but at least with KD, he was a seamless fit on the warriors. He could immediately slide in and impact winning and be a perfect fit for their system. Mbappe, you can't say the same for. Killian's best position is left wing. And the guy on Real Madrid who plays that position is at worst a top 5 player in the world in Vinicius Junior. And the striker, his running mate is Rodrigo. I don't know how any of these guys are gonna be okay with Kylian Mbappe stepping in and trying to take some of that space. It gets even crazier when you remember the Saudi club tried to offer PSG $332 million for.

Loyalty in college sports is awesome, but if any of these three things are happening to you, you might wanna hit the portal. No. 1. Super obvious. You're not getting any playing time. Everybody sees this as an indictment on the player. Like, hey, I wasn't good enough to play at Georgia, but maybe that system just wasn't for you. Like, just look at Joe Burrow. He went to Ohio State, his hometown team. They didn't want him. When he was transferring, he tried to go to Bama. Bama said, you can be a backup here. But guess what? He found the right fit at L S U, and guess what happened. Heisman, Perfect Season, national champ, and No. 1 overall pick. It's all about the fit. Two, if you and your position coach don't get along, it's time to go, because odds are he's already looking to replace you. This could also mean that he gives other players opportunities he wouldn't normally give them instead of giving them to you, even if you're the better player. And also common for guys to say, oh, my coach is tripping, that's why I didn't play. Everybody kind of looks at them a little bit crazy. But no, sometimes the coach genuinely is tripping or just downright lying to people. You wouldn't believe how much, oh, yeah, you're starting this week. you're gonna play a lot this week. Just For you to not see the field. You would not believe how many times it happens to guys. No. 3. If your coach

This is just what it looks like. Now, the problem with those Qbs in the NFC right now is they can't out Superman.

His mom was Gloria Vanderbilt. And what a life she had. Her father, Reginald Vanderbilt, was the great grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt, who made all the money. This guy spent money like it was water. Gambled, he drank hard. He was in the streets. After his first marriage failed, he met this young thing, Gloria Mercedes Morgan. She was only 17. He was, like, 41. Gloria was a twin. She had a sister named Letty, who was the mistress of the Prince of Wales, later known to be Edward the eighth. This is the guy that abdicated his throne for Wallace Simpson. So Reginald Vanderbilt marries Gloria Morgan, and together they have one daughter, Gloria Vanderbilt. Like most wealthy children from her day, she was raised mostly by nannies. This is Dodo, who she considered her real mom. When Gloria was 18 months old, her father Reginald passed away from cirrhosis of the liver. This left baby Gloria and her older half sister an inheritance worth about $44 million each in today's money. Her mom is now a very young widow. 1819, and she's in charge of Gloria's money. So they moved to France. Mama, Gloria is just living it up, okay? She's rich, she's young, she's widow. She's partying like a rock star. She's the Belle of the ball. All the men want her. Long story short, one day, she overhears her mom and her aunt talking about how they're Gonna get rid of Dodo, her nanny. Baby Gloria is freaking out, okay? Dodo is like her mom. So Nanny Dodo and her maternal grandmother catch a plan. They're thinking Gloria is an American heiress, and she needs to be back in the U S. They run to Gloria's aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt. She was the sister of Reginald. And they're spilling all the tea. They're like, you know what? She's spending all this money. And Gertrude is like, what? Let me get custody of this girl. Let me control her finances. Boom! A huge custody trial begins, and it is sensational for the time, okay? Because this was during the depression. Everyone's barely making ends meet, and here are these wealthy socialites arguing back and forth about custody. It was salacious. Baby Gloria is crying. The nanny is accusing her mom of sleeping with other women. It was headline news. At the end of the trial, the court awards custody to her aunt. So she's staying with her aunt during the weekdays, and she goes to visit her mom on the weekends. But guess what? They fired Dodo anyway. Gloria finally has some structure to her life. She's going to school, she's going to church. Then when she turned 17 years old, she decided she was gonna go visit her mom, who lived in Los Angeles at the time. It was supposed to be a few weeks, but Gloria was star struck. She loved movie stars. She started dating Errol Flynn. She's painting the town red. She has no supervision. She's 17. She's loving the limelight. So she writes to her aunt and says, you know what? I'm not coming back. I'm gonna live here forever. And Gertrude, she's not happy. But what can she do? Gloria's 17 and she's dating people like Howard Hughes. Who didn't date Howard Hughes? Then she meets this guy, Pat Desico. He was an agent, but really he was a mobster. Pat had been married to Thelma Todd, who passed away under mysterious circumstances. I've done a video about her. But Gloria, she's young and naive. So she ends up marrying this guy, and he is abusive towards her. He calls her Fatsy Rue, and he hits her. After about four years, they get divorced. And then she meets Leopold Stokowski, who's 40 years her senior. He was a world renowned conductor, and he thought Gloria was it. She was 21, he was 60 something. They got married. They had two sons, Leopold and Christopher. Gloria is a devoted housewife and she's raising her children. And she basically says, you know what? I was looking for a father, and Leopold was it. At this time, she would listen to everything he said. And when he told her, your mother doesn't love you, Gloria cut her mother off financially. But Gloria was still young and she had hopes and dreams. She wanted to be an actress. He didn't really like that, so they drifted apart. And She began to date Frank Sinatra. She knew it wouldn't last, but it was her way of getting away from her husband. So after 10 years, they divorced. The very next year, she met Sidney Lumet, a film director. They fell in love, they got married. But they stayed together only for about seven years. Gloria says he wanted children, but she wasn't ready to give him any. The next year, she met Wyatt Cooper, who was an author and a screenwriter. They fell in love, got married together. They had sons, Carter and Anderson Cooper. Gloria and Wyatt were in love. Wyatt really stabilized Gloria. He basically taught her how to have a family. They were a blended family. Here she is with all four of her sons. But later, in his 20s, her son Christopher decided he wanted nothing to do with her or her family. Around this time, Gloria decided to mend her relationship with her mother. Gloria, this is a picture of Leopold and his grandmother. Sadly, at the age of 50, Wyatt Cooper passed away during an open heart surgery. Carter was only 12 and Anderson was ten. Gloria is now a single mother, and she's got to reinvent herself. She's an artist, she's a designer, she's a Hustler. And then she becomes a Jean designer. Gloria Vanderbilt jeans. Then tragedy struck again. Ten years after Wyatt passed away, Carter Cooper unalived himself in front of his mother. He was only 23. Anderson often talk

This is Michelle Hempstead. Michelle had two dogs, a Rottweiler and a Pomeranian. Apparently, these two were great friends. In fact, the Pomeranian usually kind of took control, was kind of in charge of the Rottweiler. Even on July 29th of 2024, Michelle was feeding the two out of a 20 piece McDonald's chicken nugget. Usually, this was no problem. Sometimes she allegedly would even put a nugget or some food in her mouth and feed it straight to her Rottweiler. In particular, the palm and the Rottweiler had their own little thing. The Rottweiler, named Trig, would kind of do this chomp thing when he was telling palm, the Pomeranian, that he was gonna get the chicken nugget that she would throw up in the air for them. If palm wanted to get it, then palm would make a little snip and noise that would let Trig know that he wanted it. This time, however, both of them jumped for it. Neither one of them took the cue of the other. They got into a little fight. Michelle wanted to stop the fight, so she got in the middle of it. And while doing that, Trig clamped down on her arm. He unfortunately severed an artery. Now, Michelle got out of the situation, crawled over her balcony and towards the park for help. But unfortunately, she lost too much blood too fast, and she lost her life. What's Even sadder is just four weeks before this, in June, Michelle had just lost her daughter. Now, since Michelle was the sole owner of these two dogs, and she is now passed, the dogs were seized and disclaimed for destruction, meaning that now that they didn't have an aunt and owner, or they weren't claimed, they could now be put to sleep.

And we now have the results of the polygraph test that were given because of their disappearance. According to the court documents, their mother, Malaya passed the polygraph test as well as their stepfather Daniel. Their step grandmother Jamie also took a polygraph test. However, they said she wasn't suitable for it and they could not render an answer. Since their disappearance, there has been an extensive search for these children. And really the only material things that have been found is Lily's blanket that was about a kilometer from the family home on a tree. And they also found a piece of her blanket at the end of the driveway in a trash bag. There was also a potential footprint that police found. However, nothing came from it. If you haven't heard of this case, here is a quick timeline. Monday, April 28th and Tuesday, April 29th, both Lily and Jack went to school. Wednesday was a stay at home day. They didn't have school. And then Thursday, May 1st, around 6:00am, their mother messaged the school and said that Lily and Jack would not be going. She claimed that Lily had a cough. 2:25 That same day was the last verifiable sighting of Lily and Jack. They were seen on surveillance camera at a dollarama at night. The kids were put to bed in The same clothes they had on that day. And Jack had a diaper because he wasn't fully potty trained. The following day, May 2nd, Malaya, their mother, contacted the school again and said they would be staying home. At some point, Lily and Jack wake up and then Daniel and Malaya were in their bedroom. She said they were in and out of sleep. She was feeding the baby because they also have a child together. Lily pops into the room and they're hearing the children and then all of a sudden it's silent. At 10:01, Malaya calls the police and says she believes her children wandered away from the home. She said both children are possibly autistic. Apparently, they noticed that the kids boots were gone and Daniel decides to get in his vehicle, drive around and try to find the kids. And this is all what's being claimed by the parents. He said he went all around looking for them and that he didn't take his phone and he didn't even check the phone for the time. He was just searching for the kids.

Uh, you know, I am obviously not used to salon culture outside of anything other than beauty school, but isn't some money better than no money? Um, why would we not try to accommodate them based on what they can afford? Poor listening skills needs to be added to the list of things that you need to work on. Good to know. Anyway, as I was saying, it takes up too much time when you get to the beauty budget part of a consultation and someone says, Lo and behold, I can't afford that. They still want it though, right? And then you find yourself haggling with the client because they want more for less and you're trying to accommodate them for what? For less money and the same amount of work. No consultations are a lot more modern than they used to be and people are much more likely to ask how much it's going to cost beforehand. So what if someone brings it up? There's always a thorn in my side when people do ask. Obviously act accordingly then. But if someone doesn't do their due diligence of asking, then you get to do whatever you need to do, however many services you need to do to fulfill their expectation for that inspiration photo and at the end you charge accordingly. What if they can't afford it? They can afford it.

When I was 15, my parents cleaned rooms at the Desert Star Motel off Highway 50 in Nevada. Every Saturday, I'd help them strip beds and scrub showers for $8 an hour. Under the table, the manager, Mister Klein, treated us like furniture. He'd walk right past my mom in the hallway without looking at her. When my dad asked about getting paid on time, Klein would say, you're lucky to have work at all and go back to his office. One time during a slow month, he threatened to report my parents just to watch my mom's face go pale. I remember wanting to punch him, but my dad grabbed my shoulder and said, not worth it. I hated that place so much I could taste it. I got a scholarship to the university of Texas at Austin for engineering, worked my tail off, graduated and started a software company that made scheduling tools for hospitals. By 24, I sold it for $23 million. First thing I did after the money hit my account was look up the Desert Star. It was falling apart, barely running and for sale at $890,000. I bought it cash that week. Everyone back home thought I'd flip it into some boutique hotel or tear it down for a gas station. Instead, I kept it exactly the same, same ugly brown carpet, same squeaky beds, same neon sign out front. But I changed one Thing. The cleaning staff now made $28 an hour with full health insurance and profit sharing. I renamed the place Roses Inn, after my mom. She cried when she saw the sign. Six months later, someone named Roger Klein applied for a housekeeping job. I saw the name and my.

Never. I'm not some pro photographer, but my friends and family always hit me up to shoot their stuff for free. Usually I don't mind because I actually love taking portraits. But sometimes people are such complete jerks that it makes me wanna throw my camera at their face. A few years back, this coworker, Ashley, asked me to do a family shoot on Mother's Day. I figured I had time before seeing my own mom, and she said she'd cover brunch at this winery, so why not? We carpooled out there, and I'm thinking, it's gonna be Ashley, her husband Rick, and their two kids. Easy money. We get there, and I see, like, 30 people standing around. Turns out it's Rick's entire extended family. His parents, both grandmas, aunts, uncles, siblings, cousins. Literally everyone. 27 people total. I'm immediately freaking out because I told my mom I'd be there by three, and it's already noon. I pull Ashley aside and tell her I gotta leave in three hours, Max. He's like, oh, Rick will keep everyone moving, don't worry. Famous last words. Brunch drags on forever. These people are drinking mimosas and telling stories like we got all day. I'm checking my phone every five minutes. Finally, at like, 1:30, we start photos, and I have maybe an hour and a half to work with. I asked Rick to help keep his family organized, and he's like, absolutely. Let's do this. So I Plan out the shots, group smaller families, couples, kids. Standard stuff should take an hour tops if everyone cooperates. That's when Rick completely lost his mind. This dude starts screaming at people like a drill sergeant. I'm talking full on yelling at his 70 year old mom to move your ass faster and telling his 5

Tuesday, I had another idea. Melissa had been trying to become a lifestyle influencer, carefully curating her Instagram as successful and relationship oriented. Those Miami stories were still visible. She couldn't delete them without her phone. I screenshotted everything and forwarded them to every brand she tried partnering with over the past months. Professional emails explaining they should know what type of content this potential brand representative was posting. Wednesday, I discovered Melissa never established a legal tendency when she moved in. No lease, no contract. It was just a guest with no legal rights to my property. Thursday, her mother called. I explained everything and forwarded the screenshots. I can't say this surprises me. Karen said she pulled similar behaviour with her previous boyfriend. Turns out Melissa had an established pattern. Moving in with men with stable incomes, gradually stopping contributions while increasing spending, then searching for an upgrade. Friday, I finally answered one of her calls. Tyler, please. I'm stuck here with no money and nowhere to stay. I let her talk for 15 minutes, making increasingly desperate promises. Melissa, you called another man your sponsor while spending my money. You advertised yourself as single while living in my house rent free. We're finished. Figure it out yourself. Last week, those Miami stories have been screenshot and shared throughout our entire Social Circle. Brand partnerships rejected her. Her influencer dreams died. She posted a gofundme for $4,500, claiming financial abuse. It raised $12 before being removed. Thursday, she appeared at my workplace looking like she's been sleeping in her car. Designer clothes replaced with wrinkled jeans, no makeup, unwashed hair. I messed up lately. No one will hire me because those screenshots come up. I'm living in my car. Please help me start over. I looked at this woman who treated me like a human ATM while planning to replace me. You called another man your sponsor while I paid for your trip. Don't you believe in second chances? I believe in consequences. You wanted to be sponsored by someone else. You're free to pursue that without my money interfering. As I walked away, she sobbed, what am I supposed to do? Figure it out like an adult.

My girlfriend posted with a video of her making out with a stranger while her entitled friends cheered her on. I didn't get mad. I just pulled out my phone and did something that made her regret it. My girlfriend Melissa and I had been together almost 4 years. I work construction management in Phoenix making $125,000 annually. She moved into my house 18 months ago and gradually stopped contributing financially while spending hundreds weekly on lash extensions, nails, finer clothes and professional styling. For the past year, I'd covered everything, mortgage, utilities, groceries, her car insurance, even her phone Bill. Every time I question the disconnect, she'd cry about how her appearance was essential for career opportunities. Three weeks ago, Melissa and her friends planned a girls trip to Miami. By the time she left, I spent $3,400 on flights, hotel, spending money and new outfits. Friday evening, my best friend Jake called check Melissa's Instagram Stories immediately. The first story showed her at a rooftop bar, caption, single girls weekend, no boys allowed. The next showed her dancing with some guy, his hands all over her. Caption, when in Miami, anything goes. And a video of her kissing him while her friends cheered. But the final story destroyed me. Melissa on another man's lap in a VIP section with champagne bottles everywhere. Caption, new sponsor alert, upgrade time. She was advertising herself as available for financial support while I funded the entire trip. Saturday, Morning, Jake arrived with an action plan. I systematically dismantled everything, canceled her return flight, removed her from my phone plan, removed her from my car insurance, canceled her authorized user status on my credit cards, canceled every streaming service subscription and membership I've been paying for, changed every password, enabled two factor authentication, moved my money to accounts she couldn't access. Her phone would stop working within hours. Her credit cards would decline everywhere. Every convenience would simply disappear. Sunday evening, my landline rang. Melissa calling from the hotel front desk. I let it go to the answering machine. Nine minutes of desperate panic. Her phone stopped working, her credit cards declined and none of her friends would help. Turns out Mr VIP section wasn't interested in actually.

In high school, my friend Arthur started this game called Awkward Questions. The rules were simple. You had to ask your teacher the most uncomfortable but technically appropriate question, possible points based on how flustered they got. It started innocent. Mrs. Williams, do you think Romeo was taking advantage of Juliet? Five points for her nervous laugh. Mr Davis, why do we study the Great Depression when we're living through one? 10 points for his visible confusion. But Arthur was competitive. He kept pushing boundaries, hunting for that perfect question that would break a teacher completely. His target was Mr Wayne, our AP chemistry teacher. Guy was unshakeable. Thirty years of experience, seen every teenage trick in the book. Arthur spent weeks researching, looking for the perfect chemistry related question that would crack him. Then he found it. I found out later that Arthur had been digging through old local newspaper archives for weeks. He found a ten year old obituary for Bruce Wayne, age 16, died from accidental chemical poisoning. Arthur connected the dots. Same last name as our teacher, same small town. He found Mr Wayne's deceased brother. During class, Arthur raised his hand with that evil grin we all knew meant trouble. Mr Wayne, I was reading about chemical compounds last night. Is it true that when you mix household bleach with ammonia, it creates chlorine gas? Mr Wayne froze. Why would you ask that, Arthur? Arthur leaned back. In his chair, savoring the moment. Just curious about the chemical reaction, you know, for educational purposes. The teacher's face went white. Arthur, I need you to stay after class. He thought Arthur had finally won the game. Mr Wayne looked genuinely shaken. After class, Arthur was practically bouncing with excitement. This was his masterpiece. Mr Wayne locked the door and sat down heavily. Arthur.

Of course she chirped. You can tell me anything, Kevin. Long pause. Too long. What was he thinking about? I need you to stop this behaviour immediately. Wait, what? Stop what? She played innocent. A defensive edge, creeping in. The flirting, the constant texting, the fake emergencies, the revealing outfits. All of it stops now. I don't know what you mean. Because he interrupted, voice deadly serious. Your sister is the only woman I have ever loved. Or will love. Like, very level, obsessed love. I literally cannot see other women as romantic possibilities. My brain doesn't register them as options. Dead silence downstairs. I crept to the stairs, hardly breathing. When your sister walks into any room, everyone else becomes invisible to me. Including you. Ariana's voice got shrill. But I'm five years younger. I'm prettier, I have a better body. I wouldn't care if you were a supermodel. My wife could gain 200 pounds, lose her hair, get covered in scars, and I'd still choose her over anyone on this planet. Without hesitation. Door slammed so hard our wedding picture rattled. I came downstairs ten minutes later, pretending to be back in the store. Kevin was sitting on the couch, looking exhausted. Ariana left already? I asked innocently. He pulled me into his lap and held me tight. She won't be coming around anymore, he said simply. And he was right. Ariana Tried everything to say face. Called my mom crying, that Kevin had misunderstood her friendship. She told our dad that Kevin was possessive and controlling. She even posted on Facebook about toxic masculinity and men who can't handle confident women. But Kevin had saved every text, every inappropriate photo, every time stamp of her fake emergencies. When she kept pushing her narrative, he sent one group message to our family with just three screenshots. Her asking him to meet her at a hotel, her sending lingerie photos, and her text saying, you could do so much better than my sister. The family response was immediate. Mom called Ariana disgusting. Dad said she needed therapy. Our cousins unfriended her. Our grandmother removed her from the will announcement she just made. Ariana tried damage control, claiming the texts were out of context and jokes. But when she showed up to Easter dinner two weeks later, Kevin played a voicemail she left him on speaker, her voice breathy and low, describing in detail what she wanted to do to him. She ran out crying and hasn't been to a family event since.

My younger sister Ariana turned into a homewrecker the moment my husband Kevin slipped the ring on my finger and started a desperate pick me routine. If Kevin wore blue, she'd show up in blue. If you mention liking something, she'd become an expert overnight. If you I posted about a restaurant, she coincidentally appeared during our date. It started subtle, almost innocent, even like sitting next to Kevin at every family dinner, Ariana would squeeze between us, claiming she couldn't hear from the other end. I didn't mind since family is family. But after six months, it got obvious. Kevin joined a gym near his office. Ariana got a membership there the next day, showing up during his workout times in tiny sports bras. Kevin mentioned liking astronomy once. Suddenly, Ariana was texting him NASA articles daily, asking, can you explain this to me? Then came the fake emergencies. Her car broke down near Kevin's office. Her apartment had a gas leak when I was out of town. She needed help moving heavy boxes that turned out to be empty. Kevin always told me, immediately showing me her texts with eye rolls. She's just young and confused. He's and I agreed until she officially went too far. A hard knock at 9:00am and there stood Ariana in a tiny white sundress, full makeup, hair curled like a magazine. Shoot, I need Kevin's help moving furniture, she announced, pushing past me. Where is he? But we both knew she lived in a furnished apartment. I was about to tell her to leave when she added, I'm sure you have errands to run. You can go away now. She was literally trying to dismiss me from my own home. Kevin came downstairs and she immediately grabbed his arm. Oh, perfect. You're already dressed. I promise I'll return him in one piece. She actually winked at me. I felt my chest burn with rage, but then had a different thought. I headed upstairs, loudly saying, I need to take a bath. But I didn't leave or go to the bathroom. I stayed upstairs where I could hear everything through the vents. Didn't waste any time. Oh, my God, Kevin, you're so muscular, she giggled, clearly touching his arm. Do you work out every day? I bet you could lift me with one hand. Wanna try? I rolled my eyes. This girl had zero shame. I kept folding laundry, waiting for Kevin's polite deflection. Instead, I heard him say, seriously, Ariana, can I tell you something important? My heart sank. Oh, god, here we.
