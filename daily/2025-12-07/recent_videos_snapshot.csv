In Florida, a man witnessed something unbelievable. While withdrawing cash from an ATM, the machine suddenly malfunctioned and started spitting out money non stop, with a total of $1.2 million flooding out. At first, the man was stunned by what he saw, but once he realized something was seriously wrong, he immediately called the police and notified the bank staff. However, when the bank employees arrived and counted the cash, they confirmed the ATM had dispensed $1.2 million, but after double checking, they discovered $500 was missing. The bank believes the man may have hidden the missing $500 during the chaos and is demanding that he return the money and also cover the cost of repairing the ATM and the staff's lost work time, totaling $10,000. According to the bank's lawsuit, the man's actions constitute illegal possession, taking extra money without any legal right to it. But the man insists he never intentionally took any extra cash. He says the whole situation was caused by the ATM malfunction and he reported it to authorities as quickly as possible. Do you think the man should be held responsible for the costs?

I asked if anyone considered that I might be suffering, too. He called me a homophobe and hung up. My brother Daniel's the only one who gets it. He texted me at midnight. You're allowed to grieve. Your marriage dying. That's not bigotry. That's being human. Everyone else is performing. My sister in law posted on Facebook that I'm the exact reason LGBTQ people stay closeted, because of unsupportive spouses who make everything about themselves. 43 people liked it. My own mother commented, disappointed in how you're handling this. My phone's been exploding with articles. How to be an ally when your spouse comes out, processing divorce with Grace and support. Why? Your pain doesn't invalidate their truth. I'm not mad she's gay. I'm destroyed. That for 20 years, while I was falling asleep thinking about how lucky I was to have her, she was counting down the days until the kids turned 18 and she could finally leave. Tuesday afternoon, I come home early from work because I forgot my laptop. There's a silver Subaru in my driveway I don't recognize. I walk in, and Stephanie's introducing this woman named Savannah to our daughter via Facetime. Haley's crying happy tears, saying she's so glad mom finally found someone who makes her happy. Savannah's moving into our guest room. Not our house, the house I'm still paying the mortgage on. Just typically into one of our four bedrooms. Like I'm supposed to be fine. With this new roommate situation, I asked Stephanie if she was serious. She said Savannah doesn't have anywhere else to go right now, and it's not like we're using that room anyway. I'm staying at a La Quinta Inn near the airport. It smells like cigarettes and the Wi-Fi barely works. Haley texted me this morning asking when I'm coming home because this is ridiculous and embarrassing. She has friends asking why her dad moved out the second her mom came out. Connor sent me a Bill split request on Venmo for his textbooks with the note, since you're not contributing to the household anymore. I paid for his entire college tuition, all four years, up front. My wife moved her girlfriend into my house six days after ending our marriage at Olive Garden.

I was about to lose it when a flight attendant came over. But instead of kicking the kid out of my seat, she took me straight to first class. At that moment, Ella, a CEO, was being hit on by some balding creep. She grabbed me and pulled me into the seat next to her, and the guy finally backed off. The whole flight, Ella kept her head buried in work while I goofed around with the reclining seat like a kid having a blast and trying to get her attention. But this hard nosed executive never would have dreamed that the guy sitting next to her would completely change her life. Right then, the plane suddenly hit severe turbulence. The cabin started shaking violently and everyone instantly panicked, even the flight attendants. As the shaking got worse and worse, the whole plane went pitch black. Ella instinctively grabbed my hand. I didn't pull away. I was incredibly tense. So tense I couldn't speak. So tense I was afraid to breathe. Eventually the plane landed safely. As I watched Ella gathering her things and getting ready to leave.

Todo empezó cuando alguien me tiró agua. Exigí una disculpa, pero esos matones se rieron. Uno de ellos se levantó y caminó hacia mí. Quería darme una lección, pero ellos no se dieron cuenta para nada de que dentro del cuerpo aparentemente débil de este chico despertó el jefe de una banda muy poderoso. Hace apenas unos días. Este estudiante aún sufría acoso. Cansado de esa vida, decidió tirarse de un puente por la noche por casualidad. Yo estaba cerca e intenté salvarlo, pero terminé siendo atropellado por un camión. Poco después desperté en el hospital, pero en su cuerpo y mi. Mi cuerpo ya estaba muerto. No había vuelta atrás ya que el destino me permitió vivir en su cuerpo. Tenía que conocerlo mejor. Desbloqueé su tableta, vi su diario y después de leerlo entendí toda la verdad que venía de una familia rica. Era víctima de acoso. Lo golpeaban, lo humillaban y lo obligaban a robar en su propia casa. Se había convertido en la burla de toda la escuela. Me enojé tanto que incluso rompí la tableta. Me di cuenta de que si el destino me dejó sobrevivir, entonces debía empezar de nuevo. Primero cambié mi imagen y también mi peinado. Iba hacia la escuela, pero el conductor se detuvo muy lejos de la entrada. Resulta que antes él era muy tímido, siempre pedía que lo dejaran bajar antes, pero Yo ordené que se detuviera justo en la puerta de la escuela. Con un nuevo peinado y una nueva actitud ante la vida, entré al salón de clases

Hasta que un día la madre murió otra vez. Al tocarlo, el niño la tocó de nuevo, pero esta vez nunca despertó. El niño entendió al fin. Cada persona solo podía revivir una vez y no quería ver más vidas perdidas. Un día vio a un perro muerto. Cuando lo tocó con su dedo, el perro volvió a la vida al instante. Años después, el niño ya era un hombre. De repente, un fugitivo cayó de un edificio. Debió haber muerto, pero al tocarlo revivió. El hombre lo volvió a tocar. Enseguida un policía presenció todo. Invitó al hombre a unirse a él. El hombre también quería usar su poder para hacer el bien. Así fueron a la morgue. Ese cadáver había sido asesinado por su propio perro. Para descubrir la verdad, el hombre puso un temporizador de un minuto y tocó al muerto. Resultó que el verdadero asesino era su secretario. Cuando el tiempo terminó, el hombre lo tocó otra vez. De esa manera resolvió el caso. El verdadero culpable fue arrestado. Pronto recibieron un segundo caso. La víctima era la chica que él había amado. Él la tocó suavemente. La chica pensó que él era el asesino. El hombre se apresuró a explicarle. Entonces ella le creyó.

Not only was it difficult to pull, but it also couldn't maintain balance. The bear crashed severely on his first attempt to pull the car. Then he switched the positions of the wheels, but one side was still larger than the other. Eventually, he crashed again. This time, the car even fell apart. Looking at all the scattered debris, the bear suspected he was too stupid. Perhaps he should give up on making cars. But just after the bear left, several small animals happened to pass by this place. The scattered parts caught their attention. There was no possibility of repairing it. After such a crash, the wheels seemed like they could be repurposed. Several animals prepared to take away these wheels to avoid being thought of as stealing. The hedgehog specifically asked the magpie nearby if anyone wanted this small car. The magpie clearly said it had been abandoned. So they confidently pushed the wheels toward home. But when crossing a log bridge, the largest wheel accidentally fell into the water. The frog quickly jumped in to rescue it. Fortunately, the wood could float on the water surface. He pushed it all the way to the shore. With the help of several animals, they finally brought the wheels back home. Meanwhile, the magpie actually ran to the bear's home to tell on them, saying, someone had stolen your car. The bear was very Angry after hearing this. Although the car wasn't well made, he hadn't completely given up. He wanted to know who had taken it. The bear rushed forward recklessly. As a result, in his hurry, he accidentally fell into the river. This made him even more furious. Soon the bear found the home of those animals. He was about to show his violent side when he was shocked by what he saw. The B had turned the wheel into a spinning machine, making weaving much more efficient. The hedgehog had made the wheel into a small cart, making it very easy to transport things. The frog had turned the wheel into a water fetching tool, making drinking water much more convenient. The largest wheel had been made into a water wheel by the rooster. Seeing all this, the bear instantly transformed from extreme rage to excitement. He was very happy that everyone could make so many useful things. Bear greatly admired them. The hedgehog said the bear was also amazing. The wheels he made were actually quite useful. The bear was very pleased after hearing this. Since the animals liked his wheels so much, the bear specially cut a piece of wood to make wheels. The small animals around all came to take advantage of the free materials. With just simple processing, the beavers made a car. Though it was entirely powered by legs, it could actually be used as a tractor. The squirrels used the wheels to make an elevator. There was a pulley for the rope on top and a driving mechanism on the bottom, combined with a basket. As the squirrels in the driving mechanism ran, the basket slowly rose up like an elevator. From then on, they no longer had to climb trees to get home. With the bear's wheels, all the surrounding animals were very happy. Only the magpie came again to sow discord. Asking the bear how he did all the work, he said they were all bullying the bear. The kind hearted bear had already seen through the magpie's true nature and told him to leave immediately. As the bear made more and more wheels, even the little rabbit rode a bicycle. Although the bear wasn't skilled at making cars, making wheels was truly beneficial to the entire community.

He uses a clip to pinch his back and slides down. But just as the bird is feeling proud, he doesn't know the cat has already opened his mouth wide, waiting for him. He struggles frantically, seeing the rope break. The cat panics instantly. He frantically searches for the bird, only to discover the bird has tied him to a rocket. Then the bird likes the fuse. The cat's teeth fly out together with the rocket, so the cat decides to use a honey trap. He brings paint and draws a Tweety Bird on his hand, then paints big eyes and red lips. Then he puts on a hat and places it in the nest. The cat climbs the tree and whistles. Tweety Bird is immediately attracted out being the cat's finger. Constantly flirting, the bird can't help but fly over. The next second, the cat grabs the bird with his hand, realizing he's been tricked by the cat. Tweety Bird even wants to escape with his girlfriend. The disguise gets torn off and he immediately sees the truth. Then he switches the hats. The cat lifts the hat and bites his own finger. Only when he sees Tweety Bird flying away does he realize he's been fooled. Then the escaped Tweety Bird puts barbed wire on the pole, wanting to get a good sleep. But the cat made a trampoline with an Iron pipe and a straight jacket, and he jumps on it. The awakened Tweety Bird immediately activates the emergency device. Then when the cat reaches in, he punches him down directly. Then, using the trampoline's elasticity, he continuously attacks the cat. The cat immediately puts on a helmet, but the bird opens the helmet and throws firecrackers inside. The next second, cat is blown up. The cat refuses to give up. This time, he directly builds a birdhouse. Then, while Tweety Bird isn't home, he climbs up the pole in disguise. Before long, Tweety Bird flies back. The cat thinks he's about to succeed and immediately slides to the ground excitedly. But just as he's happily preparing to go home to enjoy his catch, Tweety Bird actually runs to his central nervous system. Seizing this excellent opportunity, the bird immediately pulls the nerves to control the cat. The walking cat's hands and feet suddenly become uncontrollable. Then, like a train starting up, he begins racing rapidly through the streets. Tweety Bird enjoys the speed in the cat's ear. However, he doesn't notice the warning sign. The next second, he makes the cat crash into a wall. You know, I won't more pretty cats that way.

Seeing its food being stolen, it flew into a fury. But these ants moved so fast that the duck always failed. Their teamwork was perfect. Every move was planned but unexpected, like killer tactics, especially when they scored a 3 pointer against an amateur. The duck went crazy trying to grab it. The next second, it lost its shirt, too. The enraged duck grabbed firecrackers. Even with its claws torn, it was determined to catch those ants. But finally, due to the explosion, the duck fell off the cliff again.

Not only was it difficult to pull, but it also couldn't maintain balance. The bear crashed severely on his first attempt to pull the car. Then he switched the positions of the wheels, but one side was still larger than the other. Eventually, he crashed again. This time, the car even fell apart. Looking at all the scattered debris, the bear suspected he was too stupid. Perhaps he should give up on making cars. But just after the bear left, several small animals happened to pass by this place. The scattered parts caught their attention. There was no possibility of repairing it. After such a crash, the wheels seemed like they could be repurposed. Several animals prepared to take away these wheels to avoid being thought of as stealing. The hedgehog specifically asked the magpie nearby if anyone wanted this small car. The magpie clearly said it had been abandoned. So they confidently pushed the wheels toward home. But when crossing a log bridge, the largest wheel accidentally fell into the water. The frog quickly jumped in to rescue it. Fortunately, the wood could float on the water surface. He pushed it all the way to the shore. With the help of several animals, they finally brought the wheels back home. Meanwhile, the magpie actually ran to the bear's home to tell on them, saying, someone had stolen your car. The bear was very Angry after hearing this. Although the car wasn't well made, he hadn't completely given up. He wanted to know who had taken it. The bear rushed forward recklessly. As a result, in his hurry, he accidentally fell into the river. This made him even more furious. Soon the bear found the home of those animals. He was about to show his violent side when he was shocked by what he saw. The B had turned the wheel into a spinning machine, making weaving much more efficient. The hedgehog had made the wheel into a small cart, making it very easy to transport things. The frog had turned the wheel into a water fetching tool, making drinking water much more convenient. The largest wheel had been made into a water wheel by the rooster. Seeing all this, the bear instantly transformed from extreme rage to excitement. He was very happy that everyone could make so many useful things. Bear greatly admired them. The hedgehog said the bear was also amazing. The wheels he made were actually quite useful. The bear was very pleased after hearing this. Since the animals liked his wheels so much, the bear specially cut a piece of wood to make wheels. The small animals around all came to take advantage of the free materials. With just simple processing, the beavers made a car. Though it was entirely powered by legs, it could actually be used as a tractor. The squirrels used the wheels to make an elevator. There was a pulley for the rope on top and a driving mechanism on the bottom, combined with a basket. As the squirrels in the driving mechanism ran, the basket slowly rose up like an elevator. From then on, they no longer had to climb trees to get home. With the bear's wheels, all the surrounding animals were very happy. Only the magpie came again to sow discord. Asking the bear how he did all the work, he said they were all bullying the bear. The kind hearted bear had already seen through the magpie's true nature and told him to leave immediately. As the bear made more and more wheels, even the little rabbit rode a bicycle. Although the bear wasn't skilled at making cars, making wheels was truly beneficial to the entire community.

But the bird also has ways to escape. He uses a clip to pinch his back and slides down. But just as the bird is feeling proud, he doesn't know the cat has already opened his mouth wide, waiting for him. He struggles frantically. Seeing the rope break, the cat panics instantly. He frantically searches for the bird, only to discover the bird has tied him to a rocket. Then the bird lights the fuse. The cat's teeth fly out together with the rocket, so the cat decides to use a honey trap. He brings paint and draws a Tweety Bird on his hand, then paints big eyes and red lips. Then he puts on a hat and places it in the nest. The cat climbs the tree and whistles. Tweety Bird is immediately attracted out, being the cat's finger. Constantly flirting, the bird can't help but fly over. The next second, the cat grabs the bird with his hand. Realizing he's been tricked by the cat, Tweety Bird even wants to escape with his girlfriend. The disguise gets torn off and he immediately sees the truth. Then he switches the hats. The cat lifts the hat and bites his own finger. Only when he sees Tweety Bird flying away does he realize he's been fooled. Then the escaped Tweety bird puts barbed wire on the pole, wanting to get a good sleep. But the cat made a trampoline with an Iron pipe and a straight jacket, and he jumps on it. The awakened Tweety Bird immediately activates the emergency device. Then, when the cat reaches in, he punches him down directly. Then, using the trampoline's elasticity, he continuously attacks the cat. The cat immediately puts on a helmet, but the bird opens the helmet and throws firecrackers inside. The next second, cat is blown up. The cat refuses to give up. This time. He directly builds a birdhouse. Then, while Tweety Bird isn't home, he climbs up the pole in disguise. Before long, Tweety Bird flies back. The cat thinks he's about to succeed and immediately slides to the ground excitedly. But just as he's happily preparing to go home to enjoy his catch, Tweety Bird actually runs to his central nervous system. Seizing this excellent opportunity, the bird immediately pulls the nerves to control the cat. The walking cat's hands and feet suddenly become uncontrollable. Then, like a train starting up, he begins racing rapidly through the streets. Tweety Bird enjoys the speed in the cat's ear. However, he doesn't notice the warning sign. The next second, he makes the cat crash into a wall. You know, I lose more pretty cats that way.

But this time, there was a note stuck to the box. Drink me quickly. With police officers watching her every move, Kelly immediately recognized the familiar handwriting on the note. It belonged to her father, who was now wanted by the authorities. So while the officer monitoring her happened to look down, she gulped the entire yogurt in one breath. No one could have predicted what happened next. After Kelly drove away, the surveillance officer reported the incident to his superiors. Things grew even stranger when the arriving inspector found the yogurt box Kelly had thrown into the trash. Without hesitation, he stuck out his middle finger and used it to scoop out the remaining yogurt, tasting it directly. That seemingly insignificant action would cost the inspector dearly. Meanwhile, shortly after drinking the yogurt, Kelly felt a sudden wave of nausea. Clutching her stomach, she rushed into the women's restroom. And that's when he appeared. It was Kelly's father. But he didn't embrace his long lost daughter. Instead, he immediately located the listening device the police had secretly planted on her and blocked its signal with a jammer to make you nauseous. Nissan, it turned out, had been a CIA operative. Someone capable of predicting a person's prediction. As long as Kelly took the antidote he brought, she'd be completely fine. But without It the consequences would be far beyond anything she could imagine. During their brief reunion, Kelly revealed a shocking truth. After her beloved mother was murdered, her stepfather Jess had suddenly surrounded himself with bodyguards. And the police, framing Neeson as the killer, might have been part of Jess's scheme. Neeson made a dangerous decision to follow Jess's convoy and forced them to reveal the truth behind his ex wife's death. But as he drove along a winding Mountain Road, a large SUV suddenly charged toward him from behind. Though Nissan dodged the first hit, the killer rammed him again, clearly intent on eliminating him. With the car inching closer to the cliff's edge, it seemed there was no way out. The vehicle was reduced to scraps, but the cautious assassin still tossed in a high powered grenade for good measure. Only once the car was engulfed in flames did the attackers drive away confidently. But to everyone's astonishment, Nissan emerged from the slope below alive.

You think you all that, don't you? You wanna fight? Let's fight. I'll beat your bitch ass. Fuck you gonna do? Facing the threat of the robbers, the boy decided to resist. But Leon didn't expect that the other party would directly pull out a pistol. Seeing the seriously injured boy lying on the ground, David was very regretful. It turned out that Leon was once a very friendly child. He often participated in some public welfare activities to help the poor in the community. But some street hooligans regarded him as an oddity. Because this street was filled with a large number of criminals, they thought that everyone should deal drugs. Leon's behaviour made them look like clowns.

Such things happen almost every day on the streets. David believed this young man might be able to change the plight of black people. He decided to protect Leon and teach the boy some fighting skills for self defense. After three months of training, Leon gradually became mature and steady. He even got an admission notice from a prestigious university. When going to register at the school, Leon met John Again. You all that, don't you? You a bitch! I'll beat your bitch ass! Hell, yeah! I did it. It's like you told me. David originally wanted to see Leon's training results. So he didn't offer to help. But the murderer directly pulled out a gun and pulled the trigger. The boy's mother fell into a complete breakdown upon seeing her son's body. David also fell into deep self blame because of this incident. The gangs in this neighborhood had just reached a peace agreement. Tommy didn't want to break the peace, but it was too late. To avenge Leon. He ordered his men to find the murderer. As long as they killed John, they could get $20,000. Hey, yo. Hey, bro. Hey, gang, check it out. You mad though, right? Who asked, man, this is

As a hidden master living off the grid, my mission was to protect these waters. With a small flick of my fingers, the mechanism slowly activated. Countless gears began to turn. One after another, the formation hidden beneath the river burst into life. Massive stone pillars rose from the water. Threads shot out in every direction, weaving a deadly net. In the blink of an eye. Five masked intruders couldn't dodge in time. At that moment, Mike is the nephew of the 48 villages chief was sparring with his fellow disciples. He vaguely overheard them whispering that his skills were no match for Annie's. Just then, Annie walked by carrying a wine jar. Mike's pride couldn't take it and he challenged her right away. Annie wanted to avoid the fight, but the wine jar slipped and shattered and the two of them started trading blows instantly. Meanwhile, the river rippled again. He tossed a handful of fallen leaves, revealing the invisible threads in the air. Then he leapt onto the web using incredible lightness skills, walking on those razor sharp lines as if they were flat ground. Before I could react, he had nearly reached the opposite shore. I threw my fishing rod at him, only for it to become his final stepping point. After breaking through the thousand mechanism array, the young man turned back and nodded. At me, I watched his figure disappear in the distance, a deep unease rising in my chest. In hundreds of years, no one had ever crossed the youngster alive. I immediately fired a signal flare, warning the 48 villages receiving the alert. The chief sent everyone to search for the intruder. While patrolling, Annie saw birds scattering from the forest. Realizing the trespasser had reached the restricted grounds, she and Mike rushed after him. At a fork in the road, she plucked a leaf and tossed it forward. The leaf snapped clean in midair, revealing the invisible danger lying ahead.

It's taken 25 years, but your past has finally caught up to you. After 25 years on the run, serial killer Brian was finally captured in Miami. Benson arrived to take custody, where she met FBI Agent Dana, who eagerly suggested teaming up to investigate the cold case. During the interrogation, Brian readily admitted to killing the first four victims. However, when asked about the fifth victim, Kira, he denied ever having seen her. She's not even my type. Red hair. I didn't do her. Dana believed Brian was merely making a desperate attempt to cover up the truth as Kira's manner of death mirrored that of the first four victims. However, while Brian's DNA was found in the first four victims bodies, neither DNA nor fingerprints were recovered from Kira's remains. The detectives head to the evidence locker to recheck the case, but the box is empty. The log shows that 10 years ago, a detective took the evidence. With no evidence, Brian stubbornly denied killing Kira and the case reached an impasse. Dana speculated that Brian refused to admit to the crime because Kira had been over two months pregnant when she died. But wait, how did Dana know that? The autopsy didn't Mention it. Dana bursts into the interrogation room and demands to question Brian alone. Using a smooth, almost serpentine voice, she managed to get Brian to confess to the fifth rape murder. Do you remember? I remember. Just as Dana triumphantly declared the case closed, something unexpected occurred.

Detectives quickly began searching for the children in the pictures. They Learned that Micah used to run a teen reading group at the library and often interacted with minors. So they suspected the victims might be boys from this group. All the parents were brought to the precinct to help with the investigation. Most of them said their sons weren't in the photos, but one father feared his child might have been abused. Just then, Micah's parents arrived. That furious father even lashed out at them right in front of everyone. Benson explained the case to Micah's parents. They said Micah had struggled with depression for years and asked to see the photos. I don't see how that would help anybody, Mr Fuller. And those, those boys are victims. And So is my son. But no one saw this coming. The moment Micah's parents saw the pictures, they immediately recognized the boy. It was Micah when he was a child.

FBI, open up. The battering ram hit our front door. Before I could even process what was happening, six agents in tactical gear swarmed into my room, weapons drawn, shouting commands. One agent ripped my headset off. Another yanked me out of my gaming chair. My mom was screaming, down, there's hands behind your back. I put my hands up immediately watching my Fortnite character get eliminated on screen. Final two players. I've been so close. They cuffed me and sat me on my bed. Agent searched everything, my PC, my phone, my notebooks, my closet. Mom and dad were brought upstairs. Both of them look terrified. The lead agent was a woman with short gray hair. She pulled out a tablet and held it toward my parents. Your son has been making terrorist threats. We have recordings. My balls dropped to the floor. She pressed play. My voice came through the speaker clear as day. Gonna eliminate everyone in the building. Nobody's getting out. Mom, gasp. Dad's face went white. Wait, that's not. I started. The agent cut me off. She played another clip. My voice again. Got my explosives ready, taking out at least 20 people. We take these threats extremely seriously. The agent said. Your son's school will be shut down tomorrow. Bomb dogs are searching the building. I didn't threaten anyone. My voice was shaking. I was playing Fortnite. It's a video game. We know what Fortnite is, another agent said flatly, bagging my gaming PC. These recordings don't sound like a game. The lead agent played another clip. Running double pump and AR. Tomorrow gonna be ready. Mom started crying. Dad looked at me like I was a stranger. Kevin, if you're planning something, you need to tell us right now. I'm not planning anything. It's a game. Two more agents came upstairs holding printed discord messages. They showed my parents screenshots. Hitting pleasant at three PM tomorrow. Got my whole loadout ready for this. Taking the high ground and picking everyone off. Those are locations in the game. I shouted, strategies we use. The lead agent's face didn't change. We've contacted three of your online friends. They're being questioned right now. Miles, Terry, Zach, all three were in interrogation rooms because of me. A younger agent spoke from the doorway. His teachers say he's isolated, eats lunch alone, spends all his time gaming. The lead agent showed my parents a pamphlet titled Warning Signs of Teen Violence. She named School Shootings, Columbine, Parkland, Uvalde. Each word made mom cry harder. They found my notebook with Fortnite strategies, building patterns, weapon stats, landing spots, tactical planning, the agent said, photographing every page. Dad tried to defend me. Kevin's never been violent. He's never been in a fight. That's what every parent says right before it happens, the agent replied. They bagged my controller, my headset, everything. An agent Scrolled through my YouTube history, hours of combat footage in tutorials for Fortnite. I was sobbing now, chest tight. The agent's radio crackled. School sweep complete. No explosives, no weapons. Building is secure. The lead agent frowned. Could have stashed them elsewhere. She turned back to me. Where are they hidden? There's nothing to hide. My parents were whispering about lawyers. The agents pulled up more recordings. My voice saying, pushing, now throwing grenades. Full squad wipe. Nobody's surviving this.

Everyone nodded. I said okay and left. Three days later, the bank called them. I was carving the Turkey when my sister Melissa clinked her fork against her wine glass. The room went quiet. We need to discuss something as a family, she said, looking directly at me. We took a vote last week. You're not part of this family anymore. I set down the carving knife slowly around the table. My parents nodded. My brother, Josh, avoided eye contact. My other sister, Emma, was recording on her phone. Even my grandmother folded her napkin and muttered, it's for the best. You voted me out of the family, I asked. It was unanimous, my father said. You never fit in anyway. Different values, different priorities. You're always working, never here for family events. I missed three dinners in five years. You didn't come to Emma's gender reveal party, Melissa added, I was performing emergency surgery. Exactly, my mother said. You think you're better than us with your doctor job and your fancy hospital. We're simple people. You don't belong here. Josh finally spoke. Plus, you never help with family expenses. Melissa needs money for her kids. Emma's starting her business, but you just hoard your money. I paid for Dad's bypass surgery, I said quietly. I've been paying the mortgage on this house for eight years. That's different, my father said quickly. That was Your choice. Melissa stood up again. Look, we already decided. Pack your things from your old room. Don't contact us anymore. We'll tell people you moved away for work. My grandmother nodded. The family name stays with real family. I looked at each of them, these people I'd loved and supported my entire life. Okay. I. I put down the carving fork, grabbed my coat and walked out. My mother called after me. You can't just leave. Finish carving the Turkey. I didn't look back. That night, I made three phone calls, first to the bank. I need to remove myself from the mortgage I've been paying. The woman on the phone was confused. Sir, you're the sole name on this.

My real name was Anakin Skywalker Smith, not a nickname, not my middle name. That was my actual legal first and middle name printed on my birth certificate. My parents met at a Star Wars convention in 1997, got engaged at another convention, had a Star Wars themed wedding. When I was born in 2002, they thought naming me after the main character would be the ultimate tribute to their favourite franchise. They love Star Wars so much they had a room in our house dedicated to collectibles, spent thousands on replica lightsabers and went to every movie premiere in full costume. When I was little, it didn't matter because kids didn't get the reference yet. Elementary school was manageable because most kids hadn't seen the movies. Teachers would smile awkwardly when they read my name, but nobody made it a big deal. Then fourth grade happened and the revenge of the Sith came out. Suddenly every kid in school knew exactly who Anakin Skywalker was and what he became. A kid named Marcus stood up in the cafeteria and yelled, there's Darth Vader, and the entire lunchroom lost it. Within days, kids started making breathing sounds when I walked by, doing forced show gestures, calling me the chosen one in this mocking tone. Someone put a Darth Vader mask in my locker. The jokes never stopped. Middle school destroyed me. Every single teacher who called roll would Pause at my name. Some would even laugh thinking it was funny. Like my parents did something clever. Kids who didn't know me would hear my name and immediately start quoting the movies. I ate lunch in the library because the cafeteria was constant harassment. Someone started a petition as a joke to get me to change my last name to Vader. It got 150 signatures before a teacher confiscated it. I begged my parents to let me go by my middle name, Skywalker, but my dad said that's even worse. And my mom insisted I should be proud of such a unique, powerful name. They genuinely thought they'd give, give me this amazing gift. By 8th grade, I stopped introducing myself entirely. I just say call me whatever you want. Because I knew the second I said my real name, people would either laugh or immediately start making Star Wars references. I started skipping classes where substitute teachers might call my name out loud because I couldn't handle the attention anymore. High school was when everything fell apart. First day of freshman year, the principal read me.

Immediately started arguing with me about metabolisms and fat adaptation. So I cut him Off. I said either you help your sister recover from this eating disorder you've encouraged or you don't contact her again until she's healthy because what you're doing isn't helping. It's hurting her and I won't watch it anymore. Josh called me controlling again and said Nina would choose him over me if I made her pick sides. I told him to try it and find out.

Nothing crazy, just wanted to feel more confident in a bikini. Josh immediately jumped in with his unsolicited advice about intermittent fasting and keto and all this other stuff he'd been reading about online. At first, I thought it was sweet that he cared. Nina started doing this 16 to 8 fasting thing where she'd only eat between noon and eight PM she seemed happy about it, lost like five pounds pretty quickly. Josh would text her constantly asking about her progress, sending her articles, cheering her on. But then it got weird. Nina started skipping our usual Sunday brunches because she couldn't eat until noon. She sit there with black coffee while I ate pancakes alone looking miserable. When I suggested maybe taking a break from the fasting on weekends, she'd get defensive and say Josh explained how important consistency was.

Five years. We've been together since college. Seven years of friendship, five years dating. He's at every family event. My niece's baptisms, Christmas dinners, summer vacations at the lake house. My dad calls him son. My brothers invite him to poker night every Thursday. He helped my mom install her new dishwasher last month. My sister's been with her fiance for two years, engaged for six months. She's the type who's been planning her wedding since she was 8 years old. Has three Pinterest boards. Doesn't matter who the groom is. She just wants the dress and photos. And the Instagram moment. Three weeks ago, she texts me at eleven PM. Can we talk? I call her back, thinking some things wrong, maybe the venue fell through. She's all giggly and excited, which already feels off. She says her future brother in law needs a date for the wedding. I laugh because I think she's joking. I literally have a boyfriend. She goes quiet. Then she says it. If I bring him, I'm out of the wedding party. I ask her to repeat that. She does. Same exact words, slower this time, like I'm stupid. I ask why. She takes a deep breath and explains. Apparently, the brothers been asking about me for months. He saw photos from our family vacation in July and told everyone I was the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen. Showed The photos. To his friends. Her fiance promised I'd be his brother's date. They shook on it. I'm sitting there in complete shock. My boyfriend's been part of this family.

I came home early from work because I forgot my laptop. Our neighbour's car was blocking our driveway again. This guy, mid 30s, drives a BMW, acts like he owns the street. He's done this maybe eight times in the past two months. Every single time, I've left a polite note on his windshield. Once I even knocked on his door and asked him nicely to stop. He just smiled and said, yeah, man, my bad, and kept doing it anyway. I parked on the street and walked up to the house, already feeling that familiar frustration building. That's when I heard voices coming from the garage. Angry voices. I opened the side door and there she was, my wife, standing in the middle of our garage in her work clothes, arms crossed, tearing down our neighbour. He was leaning against his BMW, smirking like this was all some kind of joke. She pointed at his car, blocking our driveway and said, calm as anything. You've got 60 seconds to move it or I'm having it towed. Timer starts now. He laughed. Actually laughed out. Loud. You wouldn't actually do that over a parking spot. That's crazy.

We've been married four years and she's always been the confident one. I'm the guy who apologizes when someone bumps into me. She's the one who handles confrontation, makes the phone calls, deals with customer service. I've always admired that about her, but I never really understood what it meant until last week. I came home early from work because I forgot my laptop. Our neighbour's car was blocking our driveway again. This guy, mid 30s, drives a BMW, acts like he owns the street. He's done this maybe eight times in the past two months. Every single time I've left a polite note on his windshield. Once I even knocked on his door and asked him nicely to stop, he just smiled and said, yeah, man, my bad, and kept doing it anyway. I parked on the street and walked up to the house, already feeling that familiar frustration building. That's when I heard voices coming from the garage, angry voices. I opened the side door and there she was, my wife, standing in the middle of our garage in her work clothes, arms crossed, tearing down our neighbor. He was leaning against his BMW, smirking like this was all some kind of joke. She pointed at his car blocking our driveway and said, calm as anything. You've got 60 seconds to move it or I'm having it towed. Timer starts now. He laughed, actually laughed out Loud you would.

And I don't feel guilty about it. My wife was always very close with her parents. And when they passed away in a car crash five years ago, she went into a deep slump. She wouldn't leave her bed. And I took on every chore and cared for our Newborn by myself. The problem is it's been like this for five years. For five years she hasn't left her bed and I mean that literally. She expected me to cook her meals and when I was at work, she ordered take out. We hadn't had intimacy in five years. I didn't remember the last time she kissed me. She barely speaks to our six year old daughter. I did every household chore myself. I worked 60 hour weeks. I finally worked up the courage and I decided to put my foot down about everything for the sake of our kids, for me and especially for her. I sat next to her on the bed, took her hand gently in mine and spoke softly. I know it's hard. It's been really hard for both of us. But we can't keep going on like this, stuck in this endless sadness. Our kid missed you. I miss you too. I miss hearing your laugh and seeing your smile. Please, for all of us, can you try to take even a small step forward with me, I asked her. She looked back. At me. I saw a singular tear fall down her cheek. He squeezed my hand weakly and said, I don't know if I can. I was beginning to lose my patience. I told her she had to get up. She had to. I didn't care how sad she felt, she had to get up. She went silent. The air felt heavy. And then I said that I couldn't keep doing this alone. I was tired. She told me that I had no idea of how it felt to lose my parents and refused to speak to me after that. I yelled, you're seriously telling me I don't understand what it's like to lose someone? You were getting your master's degree. You were studying to be something while you were in school. I supported you through everything. I paid for your tuition. I paid for the house that we're living in. I worked almost 70 hours a week to put food on the table for us while trying to be there for our kids. You remember it? During that time, Andrew died. My own brother and I couldn't even attend his funeral because I had to work to put food on our table. When drew died, I didn't have time to mope around and stay in the bed every day. I had to get up and work even harder for you, for us. I was still here for you when you decided to leave school in the middle of the semester. I still paid for the full class. When you needed therapy, I paid for it. Whenever you needed a shoulder to cry on or someone to be strong for you, I did it. I was there. I was depressed. Kaylee. I didn't wanna get out of bed in the morning. I didn't wanna be the only one taking care of Connor, taking him to school every day before I work a 10 hour shift and not being able to greet him as he gets off the bus. I'm not trying to invalidate your feelings, but after five years of grieving, I'm tired. Kaylee didn't say anything. She just looked at me. I asked her if she had anything to say and she stayed silent. This infuriated me because it felt like I was talking to a brick wall. I woke Connor up and I left the house for the night and got a hotel. I needed some space away. On the drive there, Connor asked me why mom wasn't coming with us and I told him that she would rather stay in the bed because she needed some rest. After we left, she kept calling me and texting me. I texted her back that I would see her in the morning and she sent a text to come back home that instant. But I needed some space from her. I turned my phone on do not disturb, put Connor to bed and got his clothes ready for school the next Morning, while he was asleep, I started writing a letter to give to Kaylee.

I warned her not to do it, but she did it anyways, saying, it's my body, my choice. Now she and her family is begging me, but I am clear. Not my baby, not my problem. My name is Brian Torres. I'm 34 years old, and my life imploded on a Tuesday night Last October. My wife Amanda and I had been married for eight years. We had three kids. Tyler, who is 7, Madison, who is six, and Lily, who is four. We were your typical middle class family. We struggled with bills, but we managed. That night, Amanda dropped a bomb. She told me she had agreed to be a surrogate for her boss, David Richardson, and his wife Catherine. They had suffered multiple miscarriages and couldn't safely carry a child. Amanda said it was the right thing to do and added that David was offering $25,000. I told her immediately that this was insane. Carrying another man's baby would destroy our marriage. She rolled her eyes and said it was just a medical procedure. When I pushed back, she hit me with the line that ended everything. It's my body, my choice. I don't need your permission. Over the next three months, tried everything to change her mind. I reminded her how miserable her pregnancies had been. I asked what our kids would think when they saw their mother pregnant with someone else's child. I warned Her about the emotional toll. Nothing worked. Her entire family backed her up. Her sister Olivia called me selfish. Her mother Patricia cornered me after church and said I should be proud of Amanda's sacrifice. Finally, I gave Amanda a direct warning. If you do this, our marriage is over. She looked me straight in the eyes and said, then maybe you should rethink what being a husband means. Three months later, she walked into the kitchen holding a positive pregnancy test. She gave me a triumphant smile and said, it worked. I'm pregnant. I said one word. Okay. Then I called a divorce lawyer. Two days later, Amanda was served with divorce papers at her office, she called me, sobbing, unable to believe I was serious. Even David called, trying to guilt trip me about abandoning her during the pregnancy. I told him straight it was his baby, not mine, and therefore his problem, not mine. The next nine months were hell. Amanda refused to move out. She set up a nursery in our guest room. She kept asking me for help as if I was still her husband. Whenever she asked me to assemble baby furniture, pick up supplies, or drive her to appointments, I would repeat the same line every time. Not my baby, not my problem. When she went into labor, she called me repeatedly, panicking because David was in a meeting and Catherine was at a spa. I hung up and went back to work. After the birth, the begging began. Amanda's family called Non Stop. David showed up to

In my house, nobody cried alone. Ever. My dad made this rule when my older brother Jake came home from school with a black eye and tried to hide in the bathroom to cry. Dad just sat outside the door and said, you can cry, but not by yourself. I was eight and thought it was the weirdest thing. Like, why couldn't I just go to my room and be sad? If I got a bad grade or some kid at school was mean to me, I try to sneak off to cry, but someone always showed up. Mom, Dad, or Jake would just sit down next to me. They wouldn't say anything. They just be there. At first it felt annoying. I remember thinking, can I just be sad alone for five minutes? But then something weird happened. It actually helped, like, way more than I expected. The rule became automatic in our house. If you saw someone tearing up, you didn't ask questions or try to fix it. You just joined them. Even when my friends came over. They Learned fast. One time, my friend Chloe was crying over some drama with this boy she liked during a sleepover. Without even thinking, I sat down next to her on my bedroom floor. I didn't say anything, just handed her some tissues and sat there. Later, she told me it was the nicest thing anyone had. Ever done for her? Most people either ignored her when she cried or tried to give her advice she didn't want. She said just having someone sit with her made her feel less alone. Things got more intense when mom got diagnosed with cancer. I was in sixth grade and didn't really understand what that meant, but I knew it was bad from how quiet everyone got. The crying rule became even more important then. I remember one night I came downstairs to get water and found dad crying at the kitchen table. He was just sitting there with his head in his hands, trying to be quiet. I grabbed a spoon and the jar of peanut butter from the counter and sat down next to him. I handed him a spoonful, and he looked up at me with red eyes and smiled a little. Thanks, kiddo, he said. You remember the rule? We sat there eating peanut butter straight from the jar until he stopped crying. He never told me what was wrong, but I knew it was about mom. The next morning, he seemed better, like sharing that moment helped him handle whatever he was dealing with. When mom started chemo, she cried a lot, but we all took turns sitting with her. Sometimes all four of us would pile onto her bed and just be there while she let it out. Jake would bring his homework. Dad would read the newspaper. I'd play games on my phone. We weren't trying to cheer her up or make her stop. We were just making sure she wasn't alone. The hardest part was when Jake left for college. He called one night during his first week, really crying. I could hear it in his voice, even though he was trying to hide it. Dad put the phone on speaker, and we all sat around it while Jake talked about feeling homesick and overwhelmed. Even through the phone, we followed the rule. Now I'm in college, too, and I still do it without thinking. My roommate Emma had a total breakdown last month over failing a test. She was sobbing on her bed, and I just sat down on the floor next to her. I didn't try to tell her it would be okay or that one test didn't matter. I just sat there. After about 20 minutes, he stopped crying and looked at me. Why are you just sitting there? She asked. I shrugged. It's just what we do in my family. Nobody cries alone. She stared at me for a second, then started crying again. But this time it was different. She told me later that she'd never had someone just be with her when she was upset. Her family always tried to fix everything or told her to stop being dramatic. She said having me just sit there made her feel like it was okay to be sad. My friends think it's weird at first, but they get Used to it

She filed for divorce immediately, thinking she'd hit the Jackpot. Since we've been married for five years, Lauren strutted into that Phoenix courtroom wearing a two thousand dollar dress I'd bought her, confident as hell. Her lawyer was already calculating his commission on what they thought would be a four million dollar payout for my construction business and dad's inheritance. The whole courtroom was packed. Lauren had actually invited some of her friends to watch what she called James's comeuppance. She been telling everyone for weeks how she was about to become independently wealthy. Your honor, her attorney announced, adjusting his expensive tie. Mrs. Peterson deserves substantial compensation for supporting her husband's career growth during their five year marriage. Lauren actually winked at me from across the room. She thought I was just some heartbroken guy who'd roll over and pay whatever she demanded. Her friends in the gallery were practically grinning, waiting for the show. But here's what Lauren didn't know. Six months before I caught her cheating, I'd started noticing weird charges on our joint credit card. Expensive dinners at restaurants I'd never been to, hotel rooms booked during girls trips that didn't add up, designer lingerie purchases that never made it home. The final straw was when I found an 800 dollar charge at a jewelry store downtown. When I asked Lauren about it, she said she bought herself A birthday present. Problem was, her birthday wasn't for four months. So I hired a private investigator named Frank. Best $5,000 I ever spent. Frank followed Lauren for six weeks. What he discovered was worse than I imagined. The yoga instructor was just the latest in a long line of affairs. There was also her personal trainer, a bartender from her favorite restaurant, and even one of my own business partners. Lauren had been using our joint accounts to fund these relationships, expensive gifts, romantic getaways, even paying for her affairs, gym memberships. She'd blown through nearly $50,000 of our money over two. In our divorce hearing, my wife smirked. I'm taking.

We're halfway through freshman year and my friends still grabbed my wrist to show people how their fingers overlap or joke that I could share my metabolism with them. Not kidding. Last week, my roommate Leah literally put extra fries on my plate when I wasn't looking because someone needs to feed you, babe. Finding this friend group three months into college felt like finally breathing. They adopted me instantly. Leah pulling me into their booth at the dining hall, Sophie looping her arm through mine at parties. At every party, they joke I was their pocket sized friend. Yeah, makes comments like eat a burger skinny whenever we go out. For months it was relentless but weirdly affectionate. You're gonna blow away. Real women have curves. Bones are for dogs. Every meal was commentary. How are you full already? Must be nice to eat whatever you want. from their guy friend group literally picked me up with one arm once just to prove he could. But it felt like belonging, like finally having friends who cared enough to tease me. Besides bringing up my celiac seems dramatic. I'd rather take the skinny jokes and be the friend who needs special accommodations. Then three weeks ago, something shifted. The comments stopped. No more eat a burger jokes. No more grabbing my wrists. Instead, they got weird, careful, like they were walking on eggshells. Leah started buying extra snacks for the Room, casually leaving them on my desk. Sophie stopped making the metabolism jokes, replaced with random compliments about my personality. Olivia began suggesting restaurants with lots of options. When we went out Thursday night, I'm coming back early from Bio Lab and I hear them through the door. Our whole crew is in there. Leah, Sophie, Olivia, Jade, Madison. They never hang without me. Saturday at the pre game, before everyone else shows up, Leah's saying we have to be supportive but direct. The signs were all there. Jade says she never finishes meals, goes to the bathroom right after eating. She's getting thinner. My heart stops. They think I'm bulimic. Madison adds something about nutrition labels and restrictive behaviour. Leah's voice gets soft, talking about doing this with love. They're planning an intervention for me. I text Sam from home about what I just heard. She asks what they could possibly be staging an intervention for. And when I tell her they think I'm bulimic, she points out the obvious. It's because of my celiac. But they don't know about that. She tells me to just tell them. But I have a better idea. I'm going to make a point. Saturday arrives. I've been at the library all day, giving them time to set up. At 5:45, I hit up the only gluten.

I'm 32. My mom kicked me out at 16 because I wasn't contributing enough to the household bills. Told me if I couldn't pay rent, I could sleep under a bridge. I moved in with my best friend's family, worked three jobs through high school and college. Built a successful IT consulting firm by 28. Haven't spoken to her in 16 years. Last month, she filed a lawsuit against me. Claimed I abandoned her in her old age and owed her financial support as her only child. The notification came via certified mail. I almost laughed when I read it. Then I saw she was asking for $5,000 a month in overdue family support payments, $50,000 in damages for emotional distress. My lawyer said these cases were rare, but not unheard of. Some states have filial responsibility laws, but given my history, he was confident we'd win. The courthouse was downtown. I took the day off work, wore my best suit. Figured if I was going to face her after 16 years, I'd at least look successful. She showed up with her lawyer and an entourage. My aunt, who I barely remembered, some neighbors from the old street, even my cousin Marcus, who used to steal my lunch money. Her lawyer was young, probably fresh out of law school. Kept shuffling papers nervously. The Judge was an older woman with reading glasses on a chain. She looked tired, like she'd seen a thousand of these cases. Mom's lawyer went first. Painted this picture of a devoted single mother who sacrificed everything for her ungrateful son. Said she worked double shifts at the hospital, showed photos of me as a kid at birthday parties and Christmas mornings. Her character witnesses backed her up. Said she was always such a caring mother, always put her son first. They couldn't believe how I'd abandoned her. My aunt even cried on the stand. It broke her heart, watching her sister struggle alone while her wealthy son ignored her. I sat there listening to this alternate reality. It was impressive, really. She'd rewritten the entire story. Then it was our turn. My lawyer started simple. Asked her about the last time she contacted me before filing the lawsuit. She stammered, well, I. I didn't have his number. He changed it. Did you try reaching out through social media, email, a letter? He blocked me everywhere. He didn't want contact. So you're saying your son, who you claim to love and miss, blocked you everywhere, and you never wondered why? She looked uncomfortable. Teenagers rebel. I figured he'd come around. He's 32, ma'am. The judge leaned forward, looking interested. Now, my lawyer continued, let's talk about when he turns 16. You filed a lawsuit claiming he abandoned the family. Can you tell the court what happened that year? He. He. Decided to leave. Thought he knew better than his mother. Did you ask him to leave? I may have suggested he needed to start contributing more or find other arrangements. Their arrangements. He was 16, still in high school. Where exactly did you expect him to go? She shifted in her seat. I assumed he'd get a job, learn responsibility. Did you provide him with food, shelter, basic necessities? After asking him to leave, he chose not to stay. That's when the judge interrupted. Ma'am, I need a clear answer.

We all looked at each other confused, but about half the class got up and moved. I stayed on the right with the kids whose parents were still together. Now, everyone who has a dog, stay. Stand. Everyone else, sit down. Three kids sat down on the left side. This was getting weird, but we kept following along because what else were we supposed to do? Right side. Anyone who walks to school moved to the back of the room. Me and four other kids moved to the back. I was starting to feel uncomfortable. Why did she need to know this stuff? Back row. Anyone who stops at the corner store on Maple Street before school, stay standing. Just me and Kaylee were left standing. My heart started beating faster. Kaylee, sit down. If you go there on Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kaylee sat down. I was the only one left standing in the back corner of the room. The substitute teacher stared at me for a long moment, then smiled. Perfect. Everyone return to your normal seats. We all moved back, confused and whispering to each other. She started teaching math like nothing happened, but I couldn't focus. Why did she need to know my exact routine? At lunch, I told my friends about how creepy it was. George said maybe she was just doing some weird icebreaker activity. But Emma pointed out She never even told us her name. When we got back from lunch, this substitute was gone. Principal Hilton was there instead, looking serious. Class, I need to ask you all some questions about this morning. He had us recreate exactly where we stood during each sort. He wrote down everyone's positions and took photos with his phone. When he got to me standing alone in the back corner, his face went pale. Did she say anything to you specifically? He asked me. No, she just stared at me. Then had everyone sit down. He called my parents to pick me up immediately. In his office with my parents and two police officers, I found out the truth. Three weeks ago, a woman had robbed the corner store on Maple Street.

I froze mid step in the lobby. My dad had texted me 20 minutes ago saying he was fine and begging me to bring him real food because the hospital meals were terrible. I'm sorry, what? Elias Morrow, room 4, 12. I literally just talked to him. The nurse's face went completely pale. She looked down at her clipboard then back at me. That patient passed away three days ago. The family was already notified. My stomach dropped. That's impossible. Show me his room right now. She hesitated, then nodded and LED me to the elevator. My hands were shaking as I pulled out my phone and showed her the text thread. The messages were right there. Bring me a burger, extra pickles. This hospital is trying to starve me. Sent 23 minutes ago. We stepped off on the fourth floor and walked to room 4, 12. The nurse swiped her badge and pushed open the door. Empty, completely stripped air. No bed, no medical equipment, no personal items, nothing but four white walls and the faint smell of industrial cleaner. Where is my father? My voice came out sharper than I intended. The nurse was now visibly panicking. She grabbed her radio and called for security. Within minutes, a guard on the floor supervisor appeared. I showed them all the texts. Someone needs to explain to me how A dead man is sending me messages about hospital food. The supervisor pulled up records on her tablet. Her face went ghostly white. Oh, my God. Mr Marrow, your father was discharged three days ago against medical advice. Discharge papers were signed by Lorna Merrow, listed as his wife and primary caregiver. Lorna, my stepmother of two years. She told us he wanted to go to a private facility. We had no reason to question it. The supervisor's voice was shaking now. But these records, they say he's deceased, shouldn't be in the system. Which facility? I demanded. She pulled up the transfer paperwork. Sunset Meadows Care Home, about 30 minutes from here. I was already running for the elevator. I broke every speed limit getting there when I burst through the doors of some.

I looked up from my plate. What settlement money? Uncle Frank's smile faded instantly. From the car accident five years ago when that delivery truck ran the red light and you spent three weeks in the hospital, my sister Heather made a strange choking sound. I watched her face drain of all color, turning almost gray under the dining room lighting. I never got any settlement money, I said slowly, a cold feeling spreading through my chest. Still paying off those hospital bills and installments. Uncle Frank put down his wine glass very carefully. Brianna, the insurance company settled for $127,000. I know because I helped your mom with the paperwork when you were still recovering. You were only 17. So it went into a custodial account until you turned eighteen. I turned to my mother, waiting for her to clear up this obvious misunderstanding, but she wouldn't look at me, very interested in cutting her Turkey into impossibly tiny pieces. Mom, my voice came out barely above a whisper. My mind was racing, trying to make the pieces fit together. I turned 18 five years ago. Where did the money go? The silence stretched out forever. I could hear the kitchen faucet dripping in the other room, each drop echoing like a countdown. Gave it to Heather, mom finally whispered, her voice cracking, for her education and getting Started with her life. The words didn't make sense at first. They literally didn't compute in my brain. You gave my money to Heather. I repeated each word coming out separately and distinctly. The money from my accident, from my broken bones and my three weeks in the hospital and my six months of physical therapy. You were getting financial aid for community college, Heather said defensively, her voice shrill and desperate. You didn't need it as much as I did. I had private university tuition and living expenses. I stared at her, actually stared, seeing my sister clearly for maybe the first time in my entire life. Is that where you got your car? The question came out flat and dead. That Audi you bought junior year that you said was from your internship. She didn't answer, but her face answered for her. The apartment downtown you lived in. My voice was getting louder, stronger. The study abroad semester in Paris. The designer clothes you kept posting online. We were going to tell you, mom started weakly when I shouted. Standing up so fast, my chair backward and hit the wall. When exactly were you planning to mention that you stole $127,000 from your daughter who got hit by a truck? The math was simple and devastating. Well, I've been working 40 hours a week at target and going to community college at night, sleeping four hours and living on energy drinks and stress. Heather had been spending my Blood money on her dream life. I called you crying, I said, my voice breaking completely. I called you crying because I couldn't afford my textbooks and you told me to budget better. I was eating Dollar Menu food for dinner while making monthly payments on bills from my own accident. You were always so resilient, Heather said, tears starting to stream down her face. Now you are handling everything fine. Handling it, I repeated the word, tasting like poison in my mouth. I had to drop two classes last semester because I couldn't afford them and work enough hours to pay rent. I've been living in a basement apartment with black mold because it's all I can afford. I haven't been to a dentist in three years. Uncle Frank was doing calculations on his phone, face getting redder by the second. $127,000 plus five years of interest. At even a conservative rate, we're talking about 145,000 to $150,000 in total value you were owed. Mom was sobbing now, but I felt absolutely nothing looking at her tears. She'd had five years to feel guilty, five years to tell the truth. That money was supposed to compensate me for permanent nerve damage in my left leg, I said. My voice deadly calm now. For the nightmares I still have about that truck coming at me, for the fact that I can't run anymore without pain and you gave it away like it was nothing. She's still your sister, mom pleaded. Desperately, no, I said. Clearly, she's a thief who watched me suffer for five years while spending money that belonged to me. That's not a sister. That's a stranger who stole my future. I grabbed my coat from the hallway, my hands surprisingly steady. Now where are you going, mom? Asked her voice small and afraid. To a lawyer, I said simply looking at Uncle Frank, I'm assuming you kept all that paperwork. He nodded grimly. Every document, I'll have it ready tomorrow morning.

My name is Shavon. The H is silent. It's pronounced like Shavon. Pretty simple once you hear it once. I've had this name my whole life, so I'm used to people getting it wrong the first time. That's fine. Normal. But Missus Hilden Brand was different. First day of 10th grade English, she called roll see O Bohan, she said, really dragging out every single letter like she was reading it off a cereal box. Raise my hand. It's shiv on. Actually, the H is silent. She smiled and nodded. Oh, of course. Sorry about that. Next day, same thing. See you Bahan. She added extra emphasis on the H this time like she was trying to make sure everyone heard it. I corrected her again politely. She apologized again. 3rd day, 4th day, 5th day. Every single morning during roll call, she butchered it. And it wasn't just saying it wrong anymore. She was over pronouncing the H like she was spitting it out. The o bun. Week 2, I stopped raising my hand to correct her. I just sit there while she said it wrong and answer here in the flattest voice possible. My friend Whitney who sat next to me started keeping count in her notebook. But the end of September, Missus Hilden Brand had mispronounced my name 47 * 47. I asked to stay after class one day in October. Missus Hilden Brand I've asked you like 100 times, but my name is shivon. The h is completely silent. Could you please try to remember? She looked at me over her reading glasses and smiled this fake smile. Oh, sweetie, I know. It's just such an unusual spelling. I'll try harder next morning during roll call. C o bahn. Louder than before. Whitney was convinced she was doing it on purpose. Dude, nobody is that dumb. She's messing with you. I didn't wanna believe it, but after three months of the same thing every single day, I started thinking Whitney was right. Other teachers got it right after one correction. Even the substitute teachers figured it out. But Mrs. Hildin Brand just kept going. Here's the thing about Mrs. Hildin Brand. She had this really weird long German last name that all the kids had been making fun of since forever. In middle school, everyone called her Missus Icky Booger because if you say Hildebrand really fast and sloppy, that's kind of what it sounds like. I'd heard my older brother and his friends call her that years ago. Apparently she taught at the middle school before moving to the high school. December rolls around. It's been four months of this every single day. The entire class knows she's doing it wrong at this point because I've corrected her in front of everyone at least 20 times. Some kids even started saying my name right just to prove they could figure it out. But not her Monday morning first period. She's taking attendance gets to my name, d O. B. A. N. Smith. She really went hard on the H that day like she was hacking up a hairball. Something in my brain just snapped. I was so tired of it. I raised my hand and said.

I was halfway through a raid in my game when Eli wandered into my room, one hand pressed flat against his chest. He was 8 years old and always interrupting me for stupid reasons, so I didn't even pause. Nana, feel this. He grabbed my hand and put it on his chest before I could stop him. His heart was hammering so fast I couldn't count the beats. It felt like a hummingbird trapped inside his ribs. Dude, what were you doing running laps around the house? He shook his head. I was just watching TV. I pulled my hand back and shrugged. You probably just got excited about something. Go drink some water. He stood there for another second looking at me with those big brown eyes, then shuffled back downstairs. I went back to my game. Mom was working a double at the hospital and wouldn't be home until morning. Dad was on a business trip in Seattle. I was 16 and in charge, which mostly meant making sure Eli ate dinner and went to bed on time. Twenty minutes later, he was back. It's still doing it, he said. This time his voice was smaller. I sighed and paused my game for real. Still doing what? The fast thing? It won't slow down. I tried taking deep breaths. Like you said that one time. I hadn't said anything about deep breaths, but I got up anyway. I put my hand on his chest again. Still racing. Feel that fluttering hummingbird feeling. I looked at him more closely. His face was flushed, but his lips looked kind of pale. Does it hurt? He shook his head, then stopped. Kinda like it's squeezing weird. I pulled out my phone and Googled fast heartbeat in kids. The results said anxiety, dehydration, too much sugar, caffeine, normal stuff. I asked Eli if he had any soda. He said no. Any candy? No. Was he nervous about something? He just stared at me. I'm nervous now because my heart won't stop. Fair point. Got him a glass of water and made him sit on the couch. I figured it would pass in a few minutes. Hearts don't just race forever for no reason. Fifteen minutes later, his heart was still pounding. I could see his shirt moving with each beat. That wasn't normal, right? I counted silently, watching the fabric jump. I got to 60 beats and maybe 20 seconds. That math didn't seem right, but I wasn't exactly a doctor. I texted Mom, Eli's heart is beating really fast. Normal. Three dots appeared, then disappear. She was probably with a patient. I looked at my brother. He was sitting very still on the couch. His hand pressed to his chest like he could hold his heart in place. Jenna, I feel weird. Weird how like floaty, like when you stand up too fast. But I'm sitting down. I grabbed my Phone again and searched, fast heartbeat, dizzy child. The first result mentioned something called s V t, super ventricular tachycardia, heart rate over 150 beats per minute. I scrolled faster. It said to call a doctor if symptoms persisted more than a few minutes. We were past that, way past that. My phone buzzed, mom, how fast is he? Pale, dizzy. I typed back, yes to both. It's been like 45 minutes. Her response was immediate. Call 9, 1 1 now. Don't wait. I'm coming. My.

Last summer I was complaining about it again and she just shook her head at me. For my birthday two months ago, she gave me a bonnet, the same kind she wears every night. I honestly didn't think it would work for my hair, but I tried it anyway. Dude, game changer. I wake up and my hair is actually manageable now. Way less frizz, barely any knots. I've been wearing it every single night since my dad showed up at my apartment last weekend with his new girlfriend. I say new because my dad has a different girlfriend every few months. This one's name is Brenda and I'd literally never met her before. She walked in with her overnight bag like she owned the place. My dad gave me a hug and introduced us. Brenda barely looked at me. Cool start that night, I got ready for bed around 11. I brushed my teeth and put on my bonnet like I always do. I walked back into the living Room to grab my phone charger. And Brenda just froze. She stared at me like I'd walked out in a full clown costume. Then she goes, what is that on your head? I touched my bonnet. Oh, it's just a bonnet. I wear it to sleep so my hair doesn't go crazy.

It was a Tuesday afternoon, and Jenna, our daughter's babysitter, was standing in our living room waiting to get paid. She'd watched our three year old Mia for the whole day while I was at work, and my husband Cole was supposedly handling some job interviews. Jenna had her backpack on and kept checking her phone. She needed to catch a bus. Cole was sitting on the couch, going through his wallet for the third time. He pulled out a 20 and held it up. This is all I got right now. I can Venmo you the rest tomorrow, he said. Jenna looked uncomfortable. Mister Hayes, we agreed on 60 for today. I really need the full amount now. I said, I'll get it to you tomorrow. What's the problem? I walked over from the kitchen. Cole, just pay her the 60. I have cash in my purse. He shot me a look. Stay out of it. I'm handling this. You're not handling it. She watched Mia all day and needs to get paid now. I said. I said, stay out of it! Cole snapped louder this time. Jenna was standing there looking at the floor. I could tell she just wanted to leave, but also didn't want to lose 40 bucks. Just give her the money, Cole. This is ridiculous, I said. He stood up from the couch. Shut up! I'm the one Who pays her every week? So shut up and stay out of it. Something in me just broke. I was so tired of him talking to me like that in front of other people, in front of our kids. Babysitter who is barely 19 years old. Make me shut up. Then I said. I don't even know why I said it. It just came out. He walked right up to me and slapped me across the mouth with his open hand. Hard. My ears started ringing. The whole left side of my face went completely numb, and I tasted blood on my lip. I just stood there frozen. Then I grabbed the 20 off the couch and basically ran out the front door without saying anything. I touched my mouth, and my fingers came back with blood on them. My lip was split on the inside. Cole walked back to the couch and sat down like nothing happened. He picked up his phone and started scrolling. I went to the bathroom and locked the door. I looked in the mirror, and my lip was already swelling up. There was a red Mark across my whole cheek. I sat on the edge of the bathtub and just cried. I couldn't even make sound come out. It was like silent crying where you can't breathe right. I stayed in there for maybe 20 minutes. When I came out, Cole was in the kitchen making himself a sandwich. Babe, come on. I'm sorry.

He followed me. Don't be like this. You know I didn't mean it. You dared me to do it. I still didn't say anything. I grabbed my pillow and a blanket and went to sleep on the couch. He came out there an hour later. So you're really not gonna talk to me? I said I was sorry. You pushed me when you know I'm struggling right now. I turned my face away from him. The next morning, I still didn't talk to him. I got Mia ready for daycare and dropped

I screenshotted it, smiled, and said, you're right. Then I airdropped it to everyone at the table. Thanksgiving at my parents house. 20 people crammed around the dining table. My sister Lisa and her husband Brett sitting right across from me. Everything seems normal until my phone buzzed. A text from Brett. You look incredible today. That dress is doing things to me. I looked up. He was staring at me, smiling. Lisa was talking to our mom, completely oblivious. Another text. We should grab drink sometime, just us. Then another. Your sister doesn't have to know. What happens between us? Days between us. I felt sick. This man had been married to my sister for three years. I took screenshots of everything. Then I noticed everyone at the table had iPhones. I opened airdrop, selected everyone, sent all three screenshots. Phone started buzzing around the table. My mom checked hers first. Her face went from confused to horrified. My dad's jaw clenched. My brother stood up. What the hell, Brett? Brett's face went completely white. What? What's happening? Lisa grabbed my mom's phone, read the messages, looked at Brett, then at me. Is this real? Check the number. I said quietly, it's his. She pulled out her phone, compared the number. Her hands started shaking. I texted my sister at Thanksgiving dinner while sitting next to me. Brett stammered, I was joking. It was just a joke. Which part was the joke? My dad asked, standing up. The part where you hit on her daughter, or the part where you said your wife doesn't need to know? I didn't mean. I was drunk. You've had one beer, my mom said coldly. Lisa stood up, took off her ring, and dropped it in Brett's mashed potatoes. Get out of my parents house, Lisa. Come on, get out! I screamed it so loud, the neighbors probably heard. Brett tried to grab her arm. My brother stepped between them. She said, leave now. Brett left. The door slammed. Lisa sat back down, shaking. My mom hugged her. We finished Thanksgiving dinner without him. Ask the stuffing. Discuss divorce lawyers. My aunt even made a toast. To family. Who protects family. Last week, Lisa filed for divorce. Cited the screenshots as evidence of emotional infidelity. Brett tried calling me to apologize. I blocked him. Then he tried to claim I manipulated the situation. The screenshots don't lie. Yesterday, my mom asked, do you regret how you handled it? Not for a second, I said. He thought I keep a secret. Instead, I made it everyone's business.

I looked at him, smiled and said, I do now. Then I grabbed the microphone. My husband Daniel and I have been married for 22 years. Yesterday was our annual family reunion. Hundred people, big Pavilion, catered food. I was setting up dessert when I saw her, a girl, maybe 16, walking straight toward Daniel. She hugged him. He went completely pale. Dad, mom said you'd be here, dad. My brain stopped. Daniel's mouth opened and closed like a fish. Sophia, what are you doing here? Mom's in the car. She said we should finally meet your wife, that you told her everything. I walked over slowly. Hi, I'm Rebecca, Daniel's wife. The girl's smile faltered. Oh, I'm Sophia. His daughter. His daughter. I repeated, yes, I'm 16. Mom and dad have been together since before I was born. Daniel grabbed my arm. Rebecca, let me explain. I pulled away, walked to the microphone at the front of the Pavilion, tapped it. Everyone, can I have your attention? The crowd quieted. Daniel was speed walking toward me. I'd like to introduce someone special. This is Sophia. Apparently she's my husband's 16 year old daughter from his other relationship, the one he forgot to mention for 16 years. Gasps, phones came out. Daniel's mother screamed. Sophia looked confused. Wait, you didn't know about me? Not until about 90 Seconds ago, sweetie, a woman rushed in from the parking lot, mid 40s, panicked. Sophia, I told you to wait in the car. You said dad told his wife. Sophia yelled back, I lied, the woman shouted. I was trying to force his hand. The Pavilion erupted. My mother in law fainted, actual fainted. Daniel's brother caught her. I looked at Daniel, 16 years. I can explain. You have a teenager, a whole secret teenager. It's complicated. It's really not. I handed him the microphone. Your turn. Explain to everyone how you managed this. He stood there frozen. The woman, Sophia's mom, was yelling at her daughter. Sophia was crying. My sister grabbed my hand. What do you need? A divorce lawyer and probably therapy. The reunion ended early. People left in stunned silence. Sophia apologized to me on her way out. I really thought he told you not your fault, honey. I said. Daniel tried following me to my car. Please, we can work through this. You have a 16 year old secret child. There's no working through that. I drove to my sister's house, filed for divorce the next morning. Daniel's been calling non stop. His family's been calling. Even Sophia's mom called to apologize. I blocked them all except Sophia. She texted, I'm sorry I ruined your marriage. I replied, you didn't ruin it, your dad did 16 years ago. I'm just finding out now. Sometimes the truth doesn't come out slowly.

Uncle Wayne was worth millions, but lived like a miser, constantly testing our family to see who was worthy of his money. Every holiday was an audition where cousins would compete for his approval like desperate contestants on a reality show. I'm leaving everything to whoever proves they don't need it, he'd announce at family dinners while everyone kissed his ass and hung on his every word. My cousins would bring him expensive gifts they couldn't afford, offer to clean his house for free, practically beg for his attention and validation. They'd research his interests and pretend to share his hobbies. My cousin Kyle even switched his major to business because Uncle Wayne mentioned he respected entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, I brought nothing and sat in the corner reading a book, completely disinterested in his little power games. He doesn't seem to care about family, he'd say loud enough for me to hear. Testing to see if I'd scramble for his approval like the others. You're right, I'd reply without looking up from my book. I don't care about your money, either. This always made him pause. While my cousins were falling over themselves to prove their worth, I was actively proving my indifference. While they fought over who could drive him to appointments and grocery shop for him. I got a second job and Started saving every penny. While they argued about his will, I was building my own future. When they'd ask why I never visited Uncle Wayne, I'd say, he has plenty of volunteers. I found his manipulation disgusting. Watching grown adults debase themselves for money made me sick. I'd rather be broke with dignity than rich through desperation. My cousins thought I was crazy. Don't you want financial security? Anna would ask. I'm setting myself up without begging, I'd tell her. While they spent their weekends doing his yard work and running his errands, I was working overtime and taking online courses to improve my skills. While they were buying him birthday presents and Christmas gifts, I was investing in my education and building an emergency fund. The dynamic was fascinating to watch. The more desperate they became for his approval, the more he seemed to enjoy withholding it. The more I ignored him, the more curious he became about me. At family gatherings, he'd try to bait me into conversations about money and success. I'd give polite, brief responses and go back to whatever I was doing. I wasn't rude, but I wasn't performing for him either. Grace, what are your career plans? He'd ask in front of everyone. Working on it, I'd say simply not elaborating. This drove him crazy because he couldn't figure out my angle. Everyone else was transparent in their attempts to impress him, but I genuinely didn't seem to care about his opinion or his Money the day

I was in music class when I felt that familiar tingling in my fingers. I've been seizure free for three months, but I knew what was coming. Miss Blackwood, I need to get to the nurse. I said, already feeling the electricity building in my brain. I'm about to have a seizure. The substitute teacher rolled her eyes. Oh, please. Every kid suddenly has epilepsy now. It's trendy. No, you don't understand. The tingling was spreading up my arm. I had maybe two minutes before I lose consciousness. I have a seizure action plan in my file. Sit down. She stood up and walked to my desk, but instead of helping, she leaned over me. You know what my sister did when her daughter claimed to have seizures? She ignored them completely. Within a week, miraculously cured, Emily jumped up and ran for the emergency button by the door. She's not faking. I've seen her seizures before. The sub blocked her. The only thing seizing is her need for attention. Then she did something I'll never forget. She walked to the door, turned the dead bolt, and dropped the key in her pocket. Nobody leaves until she admits she's faking. This victim complex is destroying your generation. Call 9 1 1. Someone yelled, reaching for their phone. Phones in the box! Now! The sub grabbed the collection box, or you're all suspended. My vision was starting to blur at the edges, too. Minutes? That's All I had before my brain would misfire completely. The number my neurologist made me memorize. That's when my hated cousin Walsh decided to open his mouth. She used to fake seizures ever since she was little. The sub's face lit up. See? Even her boyfriend knows she's performing. She walked back to the Smartboard and pulled up YouTube. You know what really helps with fake seizures? She searched for flashing strobe light 10 hours and hit play. How's your therapy? If you were really epileptic, I wouldn't do this. But since you're faking. The screen exploded with rapid flashing. White, black, white, black. My brain felt like it was being electrocuted. Emily screamed, turn it off! Photosensitive epilepsy is real! The sub cranked the brightness to max. Psychosomatic reaction. She believes she's seizing, so her body mimics it. That's when David grabbed his head. I guess he had photosensitive epilepsy, too, because his whole body went rigid. I can't. The lights. Everyone lost it. Kids were diving under desks, throwing jackets over their heads. Turn it off! Turn it off! Malik was trying to cover my eyes with his hands. Please don't seize! Please don't seize! Ryan ran to the door and started slamming his shoulder into it. Help! Somebody help! The sub laughed. Sit down or you're expelled. Three other kids were now on the floor. The strobing was triggering something in everyone. Migraines, nausea, panic. Make it stop! Jenna was crying, hands pressed to her temples. Through Door. Window. Mister Peter from next door looked in. The sub stepped in front of the window, blocking his view of the chaos, and gave a thumbs up before pulling down the shade. He walked away. This is torture, Emily screamed. One minute left. I could feel my consciousness slipping. My muscles were already starting to twitch. This. I've actually turned the speed up on the strobe. When I was in school, nobody had seizures. Now suddenly everyone's neurodivergent. Thanks, social media. My body wasn't mine anymore. The seizure hit like a lightning bolt. Told me later. That's when things got really bad. My seizure was violent. Thrashing, foaming, turning blue. She tried to turn me on my side, but I was convulsing too hard. She's dying, Sarah screamed. My blood on her hands from where I bit in my tongue. The sub stood there eating an Apple. Oscar worthy performance, though the fake blood is a bit much. That's when Billy lost it. This sweet, quiet kid who never caused trouble. He grabbed a music stand like a battering ram. Violence, really. The sub pulled out her phone to record. This is going straight to the principal. He swung at the smartboard. Crack. The screen went black. Destruction of

I had this teenage boy, 15, who was referred to me for anger issues. That's what the school called it, anger. Said he snapped at teachers, threw a chair once, barely spoke to anyone, always wore a hoodie with the drawstring tight so you couldn't see his face. They wanted to expel him, but someone on staff suggested therapy first. I agreed to take him. First few sessions he just stared at the floor, shrugged a lot. I asked him his name, it's whatever. That was his answer for most things. But he kept showing up, always on time, always quiet. I noticed he never sat with his back to the door, always chose the corner. That's not nothing. So one day I said, look, you don't have to talk, but I'm gonna talk and you can interrupt if I'm wrong. I started guessing. People say you're angry, but I don't think you are. I think you're scared. I think something happened and you're still living inside it. Still no reaction. Then I left a deck of cards on the table, not normal cards, but this trauma therapy set. It has pictures instead of words. I told them, pick one that feels like your day yesterday. Picked a card with a shattered window, didn't say anything, just set it down and waited. Next week he picked the same one week after that, a drawing of A wolf with blood on its teeth. I didn't push. I just started saying things like sometimes the person who hurt you lives in your house. He looked up just for a second. That was the first time he made eye contact. Few weeks go by. He starts telling me tiny things, not about him, about this dog he used to have named Max, Black Lab. Said Max would sit outside his bedroom door every night like a guard. I asked, why did Max need to guard your door? And he went silent again. But next week, he brought.

So growing up, everyone in my family called me mittens. My mom, dad, both brothers, even my grandma. It was constant, mittens, come eat, mittens, clean your room. Where's mittens? I just assumed it was a quirky little pet name. I mean, I liked cats, and I had tiny hands as a kid, so I figured it was something sweet about that. I even had a onesie with cat mittens sewn on it that I wore into elementary school. My lunch box said mittens. Had no reason to question it. It was just me. The nickname stuck all through childhood and into my teens. Teachers at parent night would call me mittens because that's what my parents wrote on my lunch containers. I didn't mind. I thought it was unique. At sleepovers, my friends would tease me about it, but I just shrugged it off. It's just what my family calls me. But deep down, I always kind of wondered why. There was no origin story, no cute moment that kicked it off. I just. Always been. I remember one day in seventh grade, my older brother brought a friend over, and the friend heard my mom call out, mittens, dinner! He paused and asked my brother, why do you call her that? My brother just grinned and said, it's a long story. Then they both started laughing. I was like, what? What's funny? But they Waved me off. Nothing. It's just a cute name. I dropped it, but it stuck in my head for years. Fast forward to high school. I'm a sophomore, and we're doing this icebreaker activity in Spanish class where we have to share our childhood nicknames and what they meant. I proudly told the class that mine was mittens and that it was because I had little hands and liked cats. That's when this kid, Tyler in the back, snorted and whispered something to the guy next to him. The teacher didn't hear, but I did. Bet she doesn't know what that really means. It bothered me all day. I went home and googled it. Nothing came up except, well, actual mittens. No. It stirred something in me. I started casually asking family members about the nickname. Everyone deflected. My mom said, you were just such a cozy baby. And my grandma said, your hands were so warm. But my brothers would exchange these smug looks and crack up when I brought it up. Then two Christmases ago, I finally found out. I was 24 and home for the holidays. We were doing our usual gift exchange. I got a big box from my dad. Inside, a brand new pair of fuzzy mittens with a note that just said full circle. Everyone burst out laughing. I smiled awkwardly and asked, okay, seriously, what's the deal with this nickname? My dad held up his hands like, okay, okay. It's time you knew. And my mom covered her face already laughing. So apparently, when I was a Newborn, I had this weird obsession with my hands. Always be chewing on them, sucking my fingers to the point where they were red and raw. They tried giving me pacifiers, teething rings. Nothing worked. But what did work? Putting baby mittens on me. Except I hated them. I would scream and cry and throw full tantrums trying to pull them off. One night, they caught it on video. Me in my crib, growling like a gremlin, struggling to yank off the mittens. But here's the thing. I'd only managed to pull one off. Then I'd stare.

So I'm dating Mitchell. He's 56, I'm 28. And, yes, he's rich. Like, really rich. We met at the Starbucks, where I was working on my laptop. He loved that I wasn't trying to get his attention and that I added to my coffee, in his words, more sugar than the Boston Harbor needed in 1773. But here's what six months of dating him actually looks like. Waiters hand him the wine list, never me. His friends, wives talk to me like I'm five, explaining what investment means really slowly. The valet gives Mitchell my car keys every single time. At his country club, someone always asks what I'm studying. I graduated four years ago. Last week, his lawyer asked if I needed help reading the dinner menu. It had seven items on it. Mitchell's company Christmas party is everything I expected and worse. I'm wearing this gorgeous Chanel dress that I bought myself because I liked it, and not even five minutes in, one of the wives pulls me into the bathroom. She puts her hand on my shoulder like she's about to deliver terrible news, and tells me I need to save the money Mitchell gives me for when this ends. When I mention having my own money, she laughs like I've told a joke and presses her friend's financial advisor card into my hand. He specializes in girls like me, apparently. Mitchell gets pulled into a work emergency, Leaving me at the bar where his call kids don't bother lowering their voices. How much do you think Mitchell spends on her monthly? One says, worth every penny at that age. Another answers, cheaper than my boat maintenance. When I approach and mention my startup work, they find it hilarious. One actually asks if Mitchell taught me the word portfolio. Another suggests I'm confusing shopping with investing. Then the boss himself walks over with his champagne and says the most insulting thing yet. When you and Mitchell are done, you should date my son. He's more age appropriate and needs a pretty girl. I say, I don't need anyone to take care of me, but he just pats my head like I'm a golden retriever. We all know what you need, sweetheart. I'm about to tell him exactly what I needed in that moment when I hear Mitchell's voice from the conference room. The door is cracked open, and he's on speaker phone, negotiating to buy a tech company. The seller is refusing his 10 million offer, insisting it's worth more, but won't explain why. Mitchell sounds increasingly desperate, repeatedly asking what he's missing. That's when my blood runs cold. I know this company. I know it intimately. I know exactly what Mitchell is missing. I push into the conference room. Before I can stop myself, Mitchell looks up, irritated at the interruption. He tells the seller on the phone, sorry, my girlfriend just wandered in. I'm already scanning the Paper spread across the table, confirming what I suspected. The seller's voice crackles through the speaker, asking what's going on. I state simply that the company has three major clients not listed in the disclosure. Mitchell freezes. The seller's voice turns sharp, demanding to know how I could possibly know that. Mitchell starts apologizing for my intrusion, while the CEO appears in the doorway. Mitchell, that's confidential information. You shouldn't be sharing these things. His wife laughs, suggesting I overheard something, and I'm trying to sound smart, but I continue.

By one PM, I had 43 people at my house, the biggest party I'd ever thrown. The ribs were falling off the bone, the beer was ice cold, and everyone kept thanking me for saving their weekend. Kids were splashing in the pool, adults were playing cards, and the whole neighborhood smelled like heaven. Meanwhile, Aunt Diana called me laughing. Lexi's reunion is a complete disaster. She ordered pizza for 30 people and only has six there, including herself. She's blaming everyone but herself and having a complete meltdown in front of what's left of the family. The best part? Three more family showed up uninvited because they heard through the neighborhood Grapevine about the legendary barbecue happening on Maple Street. Even people who weren't family wanted to join the party. My mailman stopped by after his shift ended. Lexi texted me again around three PM. This is all your fault. You ruined everything. Everyone's talking about your stupid party. I showed the text to Matthew, who just shook his head and said, she still doesn't get it, does she? She brought this on herself. I replied, I didn't ruin anything. I just took my contributions with me like you asked. Hope your six person reunion is everything you dreamed of. The party went until almost midnight. People were already asking when the next one would be. My neighbor Jeff said it was the best block party in years. Even the kids Didn't want to leave the pool. Three different people asked if I cater events. Lexi never apologized, but she also never planned another family event. Guess who got asked to host Christmas? The funniest part came two weeks later when Lexi tried to plan a makeup reunion and sent out a group text asking everyone to bring food and drinks. The responses were brutal. Pass. We're waiting for the next one at your brother's house. Why would we downgrade? Thanks, but we already know where the good parties are. She finally called me crying, asking what she needed to do to fix things. I told her the truth. You can't fix eight years of taking credit for other people's work with one apology. Lexi.

Just when we were about to lose all hope, she suddenly spotted a small island not far from us. We were so overjoyed, we paddled desperately toward the shore. As soon as our feet touched land, we took a deep breath of relief. After a short rest, we decided to explore the island. I grabbed a flare gun just in case. To our surprise, the island not only had fresh water, but also plenty of wild fruit. However, when we reached the highest point of the island, we discovered it was completely deserted. We decided to stay on the island for now. Eventually, I found a cave, but it was filled with bath. Panicking, we jumped into the water and fled. We had no choice but to return to the beach. That's when I realized the waves had carried our kayak away. Our only way off the island was gone. Annie sat on the sand, utterly desperate with only one life jacket left, which I picked up. We spent the rest of the afternoon on the beach watching the sun slowly set, thinking about how we could escape. As night fell, I gave her the life jacket as a pillow and I pulled out my lighter, starting a small campfire.

Hoping to make him understand its worth, the knight solemnly revealed every other part of the dragon in obliterated in battle. Only this piece survived the assault untouched. The king remained doubt. Under the knight's persuasion, he finally agreed to try it on. Once he was suited up, the knight suddenly swung his blade at him. Sword snapped cleanly in half. The dragon hide didn't suffer a single scratch. Stunned by its resilience, the king no longer cared where it originated. At that moment, a dragon burst out of the sky.

The dragon looked strange, unnervingly focused on the king, uttering distorted, unsettling cries. The night cast one last glance for fleeing for his life.

But then a massive hand peered in Jack's line of sight, and in one swift motion, the sheep vanished with a single bite. Jack was left speechless, his heart racing in terror, while his companions hid behind a tree, peeking out to observe the situation. But in the next moment, their position was discovered by the giant's sharp sense of smell. The giant took a few steps and arrived at the tree with barely any effort. He pushed it aside, leaving the companions without cover. In a panic, they turned and ran. But the giant remained still, waiting until they had gained some distance, four lifting his legs and chasing after them. In just two steps, he caught up with them. A powerful strike knocked one of the companions unconscious. The giant crouched down, studying the scene carefully, then sniffed the air intensely. He grabbed the fallen companion with one hand, lifting him high. At that moment, another companion drew his sword and charged at the giant.

The girl collapsed in terror, fainting. With trembling hands, the manicurist grasped her tweezers, her face alight with a gleam of eager excitement. She delicately lifted the long nail, but it shattered into dust. An instant, it was revealed the girl was, in fact, an elderly woman. Her nails decayed from the ravages of time. Furious, the manicurist slammed a button. The woman thought she had been spared, but instead she plunged into a hidden cellar below. Then the manicurist turned to the second girl's nail, chopping them off with a swift, brutal motion. The girl, terrified, her eyes brimming with tears, feared her nails might not meet the expected standard. However, the manicurist seemed quite pleased with herself. She dropped the nails into a grinder, crushing them into a fine powder, retracing the faint traces of red polish left behind. With a strainer, she sifted the mixture over and over, expertly separating the nail dust from the polish remnants. Girl's chin quivered as she anxiously watched the process unfold. The manicurist ignited an alcohol burner, pouring the nail powder into a pot to heat it up. She added borax and with a secondary extraction technique, managed to isolate rare earth elements from the concoction. Her hands trembled with excitement as she meticulously worked like a scientist preparing a delicate experiment. But no, it wasn't a missile she was building, but rather she drew the nail liquid into a syringe, injecting it into A nail mold. With a blow dryer, she carefully set the shape and soon the nail gleamed with an astonishing shine. Picking one up, she struck it with a hammer and it shattered into pieces. Beneath the girl's polished exterior lay brittle nails, fragile and bloodstained. She had failed the test. The manicurist's face twisted in disappointment.

Not until the day Charlie noticed her sister's face covered in swollen blemishes, reached out to press 1 and watched the imperfections sink into the skin and slide down the braid, crawling straight onto her own face. She froze in absolute terror. Meanwhile, when Charlie pulled back the sheet, he was stunned to see her sister's thighs smeared with grease and her feet over taken by fungal rot. Humiliated beyond belief, the sister pressed her palm hard against her thighs and shove, sending the oily mask toward her abdomen. Then she yanked her belt tight and the excess fat slipped through the braid, pouring into the girl's stomach and leg. She was forced to witness every second. Then her sister pressed all five fungus written nails onto her fingers, each diseased nail regrowing on her own hand. Last, she screamed. Finally realizing the truth, the cursed braid was the conduit. She grabbed Scissors to cut it, only to watch the blade snap. Instantly unshaken, she seized the lighter and set the braid ablaze. Flames shot several meters high, triggering the smoke alarm. The downpour from the sprinklers did nothing. Taking advantage of the confusion, she bolted, trying to wedge the braid into the door frame. Tears finally spilling from her eyes. Then she spotted the fire extinguisher and a sharp idea struck. She rushed back in, seeing her sister's face twisted with rage and Without hesitation, froze her with the extinguisher, then aimed at their intertwined hair, turning the braid into icy shard. The unfair burden of fat and blemishes vanished instantly. Last, she was free, no longer a dumping ground for someone else's bodily waste. Naturally, her sister reverted to her original ghastly appearance, and for a moment, everything seemed back in place. Her sister's boyfriend ran for his life the second he saw it.

I chose a dress and stepped into the fitting room, dragging my sister, of course, because we were permanently attached like an unfortunate two headed octopus. As I was pulling the curtain closed, my boyfriend cleared his throat. I'll wait outside. But the moment I lifted my shirt to try the new outfit, I felt a suspicious tug on our braids, my sister's signal for trouble incoming. Before I could react, she suddenly yanked me backward, almost knocking me into the mirror. Then horror. She leaned toward the curtain and whispered, come in, and he did. My heart nearly exploded. My boyfriend slipped inside with the subtlety of a burglar, holding a necklace he'd picked out for me. But instead of handing it to me like a normal human, he reached past me straight toward my sister. She smiled at him like she'd been waiting her whole life for this exact moment. I stared frozen, caught between jealousy and rage. The worst part, before I could say a word, she leaned forward with dramatic flare and using our cursed braids like a conveyor belt, sent the necklace sliding into my mouth. I gagged so hard I nearly swallowed the entire pendant. My boyfriend blinked at me in confusion. My sister blinked at him in triumph. And I blinked at both of them, wondering how my life turned into this living soap opera. When he finally left the fitting room, I spun toward her. What are you doing? She just shrugged. Then she smirked with that same infuriating, mischievous look and whispered, I'm protecting you from him. That was the moment I realized my sister wasn't just sabotaging my relationships out of jealousy or boredom. No, she had her own plan. And I had no idea how terrifying it was until the night she tried to cut our braids and tie them to someone else.

Anka's voice, or what used to be her voice, gasped and stuttered in a guttural tone, completely unlike her usual speech. The worm, now partially visible, crawling under Anka's skin, pulsed rhythmically, as if sinking with her heartbeat. Jenny's mind raced. She remembered the containment protocols for biohazard organisms, but this was unlike anything she had ever encountered. Throwing herself against the glass, she banged and screamed, but the reinforced window barely budged the creature through. Anca moved closer, tilting her head unnaturally, bearing with a horrifying mix of human and insect like intent. Suddenly the worm's body expanded beneath Anca skin, causing her limbs to convulse violently. Jenny stumbled backward, knocking over a tray of lab chemicals. The liquid spilled across the floor, hissing as it met the floor, the sharp smell of awkward fumes filling the room. Anca screamed, not with her voice, but something that sounded like a chorus of insects. Jenny realized she had only one chance. She had to sever the worm's connection to Anca before it fully took control. Grabbing a metal scalpel from the counter, she steeled herself. Heart pounding, she stepped closer, knowing one wrong move could mean death or worse for both her and Anca.

They glowed faintly in the dim morning light. And a strange, knowing smile curled on his lips. Mom, he whispered. Why do you hide from me? I froze, gripping the edge of the tub. I, I'm not hiding, honey. My voice trembled. He tilted his head unnaturally. You don't understand. I've been waiting, watching, learning. Before I could react, he slipped into the tub with me, the water instantly turning icy. I felt a weight pressing me down, but it wasn't him, with something else, something that made the very air feel heavy. I looked up, and for a fleeting moment, his face flickered back and forth between the child I knew and a grown man's face with eyes full of cunning malice. You can't keep secrets from me, mom, he hissed. Voice layered with my son and someone else. Then, just as suddenly as it started, he was gone. The water drained itself, and my son stood at the doorway, smiling innocently again like nothing had happened. My heart pounded. I knew this wasn't over. He was hiding something inside him, something older, something dangerous. And I didn't know if my family would survive the night.

Front oil shrieked and sprinted down the beach. The man grabbed his improvised surgical tool kit and charged after her. Yeah! Yelling, don't stop! If they catch you, they'll turn you into a snack bar! Behind them, the starfish army flopped across the sand with terrifying determination. And just when They thought they had escaped. A massive shadow rose from the water. A giant starfish. 10 times bigger than the others. Its eyes locked onto front oil, and it started moving toward her.

One night while Jack was asleep, Lisa leaned over to kiss him good night. The moment her lips brushed his cheek, Jack jolted awake, his heart racing uncontrollably. His breathing turned rapid, wet dripping down his forehead. Lisa panicked. She tried to hold him, but the closer she got, the weaker Jack became. Terrified. She backed away and instantly Jack's breathing steadied. That's when the truth finally hit her. She was the problem. The next morning, Lisa secretly visited another doctor, hoping for answers. When the results came back, the doctor frowned. Your body emits an unusual hormone, pheromone, that over stimulates certain men. Too much contact will exhaust them, sometimes fatally. Lisa froze. Her mind went blank. The doctor continued, your husband loves you deeply, but if his body keeps weakening like this, he won't last long. Lisa staggered out of the clinic, tears blurring her vision. All she could think about was Jack's smile, Jack's warmth, Jack's promises. That night she sat beside Jack while he slept, gently brushing his hair and made a decision. The next morning, Jack woke up and found Lisa gone. Only a note remained on the pillow. Jack, to protect you, I have to stay away. Please live. Jack tore out of the house, searching for her everywhere, calling her name in the street.

The snake hesitated at first, but spooked by the fire, it lunged straight for the man watching this. John feared he might be next. Soon, John was dragged to the hunting ground. The chief shot an arrow, then unexpectedly let it fly freely. The farther John ran, the more exhilarated the tribe became. But as soon as he passed where the arrow landed, a warrior sprang after him. Though John was strong, the heat was unbearable. Within 10 seconds, the warrior closed. Seeing John falter, the warrior hurled a spear, which missed, then drew a knife. But John reacted swiftly. He overpowered the attacker, grabbed his gear and kept running. More warriors joined the chase, but before long, one collapsed from a heart attack. John seized the opportunity to vanish into the woods. There, he crafted sandals from grass and spotted a giant snail, cracked its shell and ate it to regain strength. Just then, a third warrior crept up behind him. John noticed in time and bolted. Spotting a cactus along the path, he had an idea. He pierced it, letting the milky sap seep out. The warrior discovered the sap and one of John's discarded sandals, realizing John was near. But John had already circled around He took the warrior down with a single shot after three grueling days.

So he opened the bag, checked the food, and finally took a cautious bite. Just then, a janitor walked by and started chatting with him. What do you think of the burger? The man asked. This might be the best hamburger I've ever had in my life. Oh, we aim to please. Um, Mac McDonald.

As the flames engulfed me, a stunning red gown was revealed before everyone's eyes. Though I wasn't invited, I instantly became the center of attention at the ball. At that moment, the Baroness had no idea who I was. In truth, I was one of her fashion assistants. Seeing my mother's heirloom hanging around her neck, I immediately signaled to my accomplice, who served up a platter of treats filled with mice. In the ensuing chaos, I swiftly snatched the necklace and tossed it to our dog hidden nearby. The Baroness reacted quickly, immediately blowing her whistle to summon three vicious Dalmatians. Hearing that familiar whistle, my mind was instantly transported back 10 years. It made me realize that she was the one who had killed my mother. This revelation left me frozen in shock. Fortunately, my accomplice snapped me back to reality and helped me escape the scene. However, the storm within me could no longer be contained. I decided to wage a war of revenge against the Baroness. My accomplices took charge of capturing the three Dalmatians, as one of them had swallowed the necklace during the earlier chaos. Meanwhile, I returned to work, maintaining my disguise. I specifically designed a gown embellished with golden beads for her. The Baroness was extremely pleased with it to ensure the fashion show would go.

Jennifer stared at the poster in her hand in disbelief. The poster was burned by the energy that had just burst out of her body. The girl stood there unharmed. Jennifer was completely stunned. The girl quickly reminded Jennifer that her phone was on the ground. Jennifer grabbed the phone and shoved it into her pocket. She pretended nothing happened and kept chatting with her friend. After the girl left, she still could not believe what had just happened. Back home, Jennifer tried to release the energy inside her, but no matter how hard she gripped the phone, it did not work. When she finally relaxed, a golden flash of lightning shot out. The phone slipped from her hand. Jennifer froze in shock. She rushed to her sister to explain what happened. Are you pregnant? She handed the phone over nervously. Jennifer tried to explain everything. Her sister only stared at her and thought without answering. The next day, Anisa walked into Jennifer's room. She seriously told her that she also had powers. Look, I'm thunder. Jennifer thought it was a joke and ignored it. She lay back down, ready to sleep. Okay, fine. I'll show you. I'm thunder. Anisa took a deep breath. She crouched down and lifted the entire bed. Jennifer panicked in fear. Anisa calmly told her that this power was inherited from their father. Jennifer could not accept it. She turned and ran out in panic.

Yes, the ball was back in the green team's hands. The kids raced downfield, weaving through defenders. Carl poured everything into the game. The red team coach squirmed in his seat, fearing another surprise move from Carl. His nerves stretched to the breaking point. The green team spotted an opening and the ball found its way back to Carl. Crown on his head, he charged full speed. Ball arked through the air, the entire field holding its breath. The trajectory was precise. The ball landed perfectly in Tony's hands. He poured every ounce of strength into charging toward the end zone. Just as he was about to cross the goal line, a defender lunged forward and tripped him. Tony tumbled, crashing heavily to the ground. Victory just inches away.

He then turned the winch to tighten the wire and finally adjusted the rooftop spotlight position so it could shine directly on vehicles on the road. Soon night came and his target came speeding on his motorcycle. When the target was about to reach the trap, the assassin quickly turned on the spotlight. The sudden bright light left the man no time to react and he was instantly decapitated by the wire. The reason the assassin did this was to rob a locator device worth tens of millions on the victim. The locator contained the location of tons of drugs. To pass security checks smoothly during transport, conning drug dealer actually hid this shipment in a septic truck. Following the instructions on the locator, the assassin quickly found the location of the septic truck. But what he didn't expect was that besides their group, other people were also targeting this shipment. Just after entering the United States, police car followed them. The police inside demanded they stop for inspection. Since they had just passed police inspection at the border station, the assassin determined that these two were definitely fake police. So his companion quickly pulled out gun and got out of the car, hiding in the blind spot of the two fake police. Then the assassin hit the gas and drove away from there. Fake Police who couldn't react in time. One was shot dead on the spot while the other pulled out an Uzi and engaged in a gunfight with the two assassin. Due to the weapon gap, both were soon killed by this fake policeman. Just like that fake policeman, Jimmy successfully seized this shipment. The intense gunfight had shot a hole in the septic truck, so Jimmy had to cut a tree branch to temporarily block the small hole. But to safely deliver the goods to his boss, he still had to repair the truck properly. Fortunately, there was a repair shop nearby that specialized in gray business. The employees there were very professional. Seeing blood stains on the car, they never asked questions but skillfully cleaned it off. And their repair skills were also first rate. They first filled the bullet holes with molten iron blocks, then sprayed sulfuric acid oxidation to make it the same color as the surrounding. At this time, another group of people wanting to rob the goods appeared. This time they directly blocked Jimmy's boss.

Then he grabbed a nail gun and firmly secured the gun to the ground. As soon as the target appeared, Jimmy loaded an armor piercing bullet into the sniper rifle. He checked the wind direction with his palm, then adjusted the shooting angle. The official just stepped out of the plane. Jimmy pressed the fire button. Seconds later, the official and his bodyguard were hit simultaneously. Even the plane had a four inch hole. After a brief moment of excitement, Jimmy loaded another bullet. The official's wife was also on his hit. However, the bodyguard spotted his location using a reflection. He quickly moved toward Jimmy. Jimmy re adjusted his shooting angle. To his surprise, this guy was incredibly agile. He dodged all the consecutive shots. Time was up. Jimmy got ready to retreat. But as he was packing his weapon, police officer aimed a gun at him. Jimmy stayed calm. He falsely claimed he was also a police officer. While the cop was still suspicious, Jimmy quickly drew his own gun and took him down. By the time the bodyguards reached the rooftop, assassin was gone. The official's wife was still alive. So Jimmy had to strike again. This time, he had his rookie apprentice handle the assassination. Jack became extremely nervous the moment he picked up the sniper rifle. Meanwhile, the official's wife had even more private bodyguard. Just as Jack prepared to pull the trigger, bodyguard Noticed something from the reflection. They quickly shielded the woman. Jack's shot hit the police officer behind them instead. The bodyguard grabbed his gun and immediately gave chase. Jack's position was exposed. He abandoned the kill and ran at. At the same time, another shot rang out. The woman was hit and fell. The person who fired this time was actually Jimmy. It turned out he just wanted Jack to distract the bodyguard. He could then frame Jack for the crime. The bodyguard caught up to Jack at that moment.

The woman awoke in terror, witnessing him steal her flesh, and tried to rise in anger, but collapsed onto the couch from weakness. He mocked her expression, using the hose to fill his thin arm, and gradually worked across his body until it looked exactly as he wanted. She stared at him, scheming in a planned form, smiling at his spindly legs, she taunted, driving him into a blind fury. Without hesitation, she shoved the hose into his leg, pumping in fat and cranking the machine to maximum. He couldn't handle the pressure, the machine malfunctioned and his body swelled alarmingly. Furious, he tried to chase her, but his own weight caused him to tumble, flailing helplessly. Seizing the leftover fat, she turned on the machine.

And he had been in a gospel quartet in high school. And this little kid, his mom and daddy raised cattle. So this child knew all about cattle. Barry College put this child in charge of hundreds of heads of cattle. You boys that are my age, do y'all remember that poster everybody had in their, their bedroom? All the boys had it in their dorm room. And it was that poster, a fair faucet in that red bathing suit. Yes, with her nipple. Beautiful. I go to visit my boy in his room. I've done every diet in the world. My mama and my sister and I took dexatrim when I was 17 years old. I'm the youngest. You could buy it everywhere. Do you remember dexatrim? Yeah, it was speed. We took speed as a family. We would take the Dexter trim and our heads would itch. I can't even think about going on one of these trips until I get through Christmas. And I don't mean to sound like everything falls on me, but everything falls on me. I love my family, but they don't do anything to help me. I do all the decorating, the cooking, the cleaning, the wrapping, the shopping, the do all that. Last year on December the 24th, my husband said to me, can I help you do anything? And I said, I'm gonna beat you. To death. And I can't think about this trip cause I gotta get ready for Christmas and I get so torn up that I wanna take to the bed. I wanna take to the bed, for example, questions about the solar system. And finally one day I said, baby, I didn't pay attention in school. Is there anything you'd like to know about young and the rest of us? This is my take on snow skin. I had to get all those little children dressed with all those layers and then I had to put ski boots on. Little children, they go, no, mommy, no, don't put those ski boots on me. We were skiing. This baby child, she starts taking all of her clothes off. I go, what are you doing? And she said, my butthole itches. I remember praying to the Lord and saying, what did I do that was so bad that this is my vacation? Now, I don't know what it is about my husband in a hotel room, but he gets in a hotel room, gets a glazed look over his eyes and I feel like I'm doing this. And I knew what that meant. I'm gonna have to do unspeakable things. My middle child is my oldest daughter, and you may have seen a video about me talking about how hateful she was when she was a teenager. Thank you. Well, I'm not taking that back. We were scared to death of her. If You've got a teenage girl and you're going through that let me give you this hope they're gonna come out of that now it's gonna take a long time, but they're gonna come out of that and then they come back around and end up your very best friend I know girls yummy okay, she takes care of me just like I'm her baby now she calls and checks on me calls me three or four times a day mom, did you get where you're going? Are you in Des Moines? Are you alright? I've got Invisalign and I and I don't have my trays in right now because if I had a man I would spit all over y'all right here so I take those out but I am so crazy that I'm gonna turn 57 on Monday thank y'all thank y'all but I've got brain fog from menopause and I can't even think of what I'm saying and I've gone around telling people I've got Instagram and I go, yeah, you do y'all are so precious to me. I wish I could go out there and straddle every one of y'all what I need to do is go home with y'all and put in a load of wash and so at the end of the routine after the two and a half minutes the finale everybody hunkers down on the stage puts their forehead on the stage and my baby is the finale she pops up and has a Little child's foot in her hand and holds that child's foot. I would put it all the way up, but my dress is tight in the back. But anyway, she holds this little child up over her head. Are y'all listening to me? I mean, it was a big deal. Husband is here and, but he's in the hotel room. I don't let him come and watch me. I know it makes me nervous and I'll tell you why. Socially, when we are out and about with our friends, I'm out there dazzling, you know, in a social situation, trying to spin a yarn in the middle of a bunch of people telling a big tale. And he's a detail person. He's an anal retentive type, a detail person. He'll say, Leanne, it was not Wednesday, it was Tuesday. It was not 2:00, it was 3:00. And I'm like, be quiet.

And that little girl thought it was funny and my baby looked at me and went, so I got out of there and when that little girl left, I came back in I said, what's wrong with me saying that her little panties look like a slingshot? I wish somebody say my panties look like a slingshot. I was so strict with my little children and I said, nobody's gonna say ugly words in this house and I mean it. Nobody's gonna say stupid or butt. If you call somebody stupid or butt, you're gonna be in deep doo doo. They would have never, my first hit, never scared of them. That third one came along. She started out spell cussing little bitty walking around and go, what the H? She would walk into some little child's birthday party and go, what's up, mofos? She's always called her daddy Chuck and she'd say, Chuck Yaho. And my husband who is old school, don't take crap off of anybody, he would go, she's a nut. And my husband, I bet y'all are a lot like him cause my husband's like that and very Driven and overachiever. And he, I had to hide from him that I was watching Real Housewives because he thought it was awful. He goes, what are you watching? This mess? And I would have to get the remote and do this real quick and change it before he got up to the bedroom. And one time he said to me, by watching this, Leanne, you are single handedly ruining the United States of America. And I thought, that's a hit. But my husband and I met and I was so cute and I was little. I had a little britches and my thyroid was functioning and I felt good. And he was so enthralled with me and so in love with me and pursued me and bought me presents and, and vacuumed out my car and did all kinds of things for me.

I am coordinated and I'm athletic. I really am. I can bust a move. I'm not good at math. I can't do math, but I can bust a move. But If I had to go to a club this is how I would dance now if I had to go to a club haha, cause I don't wanna jiggle and I could see a man going, what's that? There was never alcohol in our house until my sister is a little bit older than me and she was gonna marry late in life and she was gonna marry this Humpty dumpty country club man I had to explain to women in North Dakota what that was hooped to do you know country club cause I'm from a town of 500 people farming people we didn't know what we never seen anybody play tennis I've seen somebody on the on TV and I think oh, that's the queen and her people so we didn't know anything about a country club so she's gonna marry this country club lady and you know some country club people like to drink so to get her married off we all started drinking my little mom and daddy never drink okay, are there any teachers in here? Okay, we didn't hear them clap big cause they raise their hand I don't know how y'all do it God did not call me to do it if I was a teacher I'd be running out this highway with my bra on that side of my clothes my teachers for my children were wonderful and help me so much and they like me and I love them and they invited Me on every field trip they did. I got to go on every field trip with three children. And y'all know why they invited me? Because I'm fun and I'm not a butthole. So if you're not getting invited on the field trips, are there any teachers in here? Thank y'all. Lord, I could not do it. God did not call me to do it, honey. He didn't. I'd be running out the streets of Atlanta with my bra on outside of my pants. I thought about, there was a little child that came to our school in 6th grade and he was in, been homeschooled in elementary. And my boy came out in the pickup line and, and I met this kid that's been homeschooled. He goes, mom, no offense, but she could have never homeschooled us. We would have laid up in bed and eaten Cheetos and watch young and the restless. And I said, you're right, you're right. Your daddy could have done it. Your daddy would have, um, done really well with that.

Her boyfriend had been hiding the fact that he was gay. When she witnessed the scene, she didn't shout or cause a scene. She quietly gathered her belongings and walked away. But just then, her boyfriend rushed after her, scrambling and shouting, Hillary, keys! With no income left, she had no choice but to start looking for work. That was when she noticed an ad posted by a wealthy man looking for a caregiver. The generous pay instantly hooked her, so she slipped into a bold mini skirt and confidently headed toward the mansion to apply. But the moment she arrived, every gaze turned cold and judgmental. Still, she forced herself to ignore it for the sake of the job. She waited from morning until night, only to receive a chilly rejection. I'm afraid not, Miss O'neil. My son posted that ad. We actually need a nurse. Are you one? David, give her cab money. I don't want it. Give it to her, I said I don't need your damn taxi money! The whole thing left her both furious and heartbroken. But she didn't realize someone had been watching her from behind the door the entire time. As she walked out of the mansion in disappointment, the Butler suddenly rushed after her. Miss, there's been a serious misunderstanding. Please come back inside for an informal interview downstairs. After hesitating, she accepted his unexpected invitation, unaware that this moment would completely alter her fate. Soon, the Butler LED her down to a basement where a frail, worn out man sat in the dim light. She was still trying to figure out what was happening when the door behind her suddenly shut.
