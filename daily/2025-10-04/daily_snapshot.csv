When I was 12, I discovered I could taste colors, not metaphorically. I literally tasted them. Blue was salty. Red was sweet. Yellow made me gag. I thought everyone experienced this until I mentioned that the blue crayon tasted like ocean water. And my teacher sent me to the nurse. My parents took me to specialist after specialist. They diagnosed me with synesthesia, a rare neurological condition where senses crosswire. Only one in 2,000 people have it. I felt like a freak. Kids at school called me Taste Girl and would wave colorful objects in my face, asking what they tasted like. During lunch, they'd hold up their bright lunch boxes and demand I describe the flavors. The red apple packaging tasted like cherry candy, but I'd lie and say I didn't know, just to make. I Learned to hide it completely. For years, I pretended to be normal while secretly navigating a world where every color had a flavor. Grocery stores were overwhelming. The bright product packaging created a symphony of tastes in my mouth. I'd shop with my eyes half closed, trying to minimize the sensory overload. My parents stopped talking about it after the initial diagnosis, treated it like an embarrassing family secret. When relatives visited, mom would quietly warn me not to mention the color thing because it made people uncomfortable. High school was torture. Art class was the worst. All those vibrant paints made my Mouth water and revolt simultaneously. I switched to black and white photography just to avoid the taste chaos. Then in college, everything changed. I was sitting in my psychology class half asleep during a lecture about rare neurological conditions when the professor mentioned synesthesia. During the discussion, this guy, Ben, raised his hand and said, I have that. Blue tastes salty to me. My heart stopped. I'd never met another person like me. I spent the rest of the lecture staring at the back of his head, afraid to hope. After class, I approached him nervously, my hands literally shaking. What does red taste like, I asked, barely above a whisper. Sweet like candy, he replied immediately, his eyes lighting up. That simple exchange felt like coming home after years of exile. We spent the next four hours in the campus coffee shop comparing our experiences. Yellow made him gag, too, like rotten eggs, he said. Purple was bitter, almost medicinal. Green was minty fresh, which made us both laugh because we'd independently started associating it with toothpaste. For the first time in my life, I didn't feel alone. Someone else understood why I couldn't eat on plates, why I prefer wear neutral coloured clothes, why certain movie scenes made me physically nauseous from the colour combinations. We started dating six months later, then understood my world in ways no one else could. When I said the sunset tasted like strawberries and lime, he knew exactly what I meant when We watched fireworks. We'd compare flavor notes like wine connoisseurs. He helped me embrace my synesthesia instead of hiding it. We'd go to art museums together, sharing whispered descriptions of what each painting taste it like. Van Gogh's Starry Night was a complex blend of vanilla, salt and something metallic that we could never quite identify. Then made me feel special instead of strange. She'd bring me flowers and specific that color combinations because he knew they'd create interesting flavor profiles. Once he surprised me with a bouquet arranged in gradient order so I could taste the rainbow properly. Three years later, he proposed with a blue sapphire ring because he knew it would taste like our first conversation, salty and unforgettable. I said yes immediately, tears streaming down my face. Finally, someone who truly understood me. But here's the twist that shattered everything. Last week, while helping him move some books, I found his old psychology textbook. It was filled with highlighted sections about synesthesia, detailed notes about common taste associations and even a handwritten chart matching colors to flavors. My blood ran cold.

My four year old daughter, Ruby, was obsessed with our mailman, Eddie. Every day at exactly two PM, she'd press her face against our living room window and wave frantically. When he delivered our mail, Eddie always waved back and sometimes made funny faces that sent Ruby into giggles. This went on for two years until everything changed. Eddie was arrested and charged with stealing prescription medications from mailboxes. Several elderly residents in our apartment complex reported missing pills. Heart medication, diabetes supplies, painkillers. The evidence seemed overwhelming. Eddie was the only person with master access to all the mailboxes. And when police searched his mail truck, they found a stash of various prescription bottles hidden under his seat. Eddie insisted someone had entered the substances, but who would believe a mailman over multiple victims? The stolen medications were worth thousands on the street. Eddie was facing federal charges for mail theft and substance trafficking, which carried a minimum sentence. And survive years in federal prison. The prosecutor painted Eddie as a calculated criminal who exploited his trusted position to prey on vulnerable seniors. Eddie's wife broke down in court, begging people to believe leave her husband's innocence. Their three young kids didn't understand why daddy couldn't come home. Eddie's overworked public defender seemed ready to push for a plea deal. The case looked hopeless. That's when I remembered Ruby's obsessive daily routine. She didn't just wave at Eddie. She Provided running commentary on everything he did, like her own personal nature documentary. For two years, she'd narrated Eddie's every move while perched at that window. I contacted Eddie's lawyer about Ruby's detailed observations. He was desperate and skeptical, but agreed to let her testify as a character witness. The day of Ruby's testimony, the courtroom was packed. Ruby walked to the witness box clutching her favorite toy mail truck, looking tiny in the oversized chair. The judge had to lower the microphone to her level. Eddie's lawyer knelt down to Ruby's eye level. Ruby, you watch Eddie deliver mail every day, right? Ruby nodded solemnly. Every single day at two clock. Eddie's my friend. What exactly do you see Eddie do with the mailboxes? Ruby's face grew serious, like she was sharing important grown up information. Eddie never opens the mailboxes. He only puts mail in, never takes mail out. That's the rule. How can you be so sure? Because I watch everything. Eddie only touches the little mail slot part. He slides letters in and closes it. But the sneaky

Made you realize you couldn't trust them? My sister and I are both pregnant right now. She's due in a few weeks, and I've got a little over two months left. We're both having boys, but my husband and I haven't told anyone the name yet, not even our parents, because, honestly, I don't trust my sister with it. It sounds dramatic, but I've got reasons. When she had her daughter three years ago, she and her best friend were pregnant at the same time, and every time we saw them together, they were whispering about baby names and changing their minds every week. My sister kept saying they were stuck and couldn't decide on one. Then, out of nowhere, the day before she gave birth, she suddenly had a name picked first and middle. And it was exactly what her best friend had been planning to name her baby girl. Same spelling, too. That blew up fast. Her friend found out from the announcement post and was so blindsided, she showed up at the hospital to confront her. They fought in the hospital room while my mom tried to calm them down. My sister just shrugged and said it was first come, first serve and that her friend could have picked a new one if it really mattered. They don't speak anymore, so when my husband and I found out we were having a boy, we agreed we wouldn't share the name until he's Born! My sister asked if we had decided on the name yet a few weeks ago while we were helping our mom set up for Easter brunch and I said no. She gave me this fake casual oh, just wondering and change the subject, but the next time I saw her she circled back to it saying name talk was her favorite part of pregnancy and asking what names we were thinking about. I said we hadn't decided. She kept pushing saying maybe she could help brainstorm. I threw out a few obviously fake names just to shut her down, things like Maverick and blue, but she caught on and narrowed her eyes saying I was being weird about something that's supposed to be fun. I told her we just weren't ready to share yet, but she didn't let it go. Last weekend during a family dinner at our parents place, she brought it up again, this time in front of everyone. she bet we were probably using the name her husband had picked if their daughter had been a boy. Just casually tossed it out there like a joke. But before I could respond, our brother jumped in and said don't tell her anything. She already stole one baby name, she'll do it again. The whole room went quiet. My sister looked at me like I told him even though I hadn't said a word. She asked if that was why I wouldn't tell her I didn't Answer. So she doubled down. Said I was holding a grudge over something she never did to me and that I was treating her like a thief over a name. She turned to our mom like she was hoping for backup. Mom

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he'd just say, what's next, Sir, one Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Because she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd

So my wife Emma came home last Tuesday with that look on her face. You know, the one all guilty and nervous, like she just got caught stealing candy. She sat me down on our ratty old couch and started crying before she even said anything. Turns out she'd been hooking up with her coworker Jake for, like, three months. Three months while I was working double shifts at the warehouse to save up for our anniversary trip to Florida. She kept saying sorry over and over, begging me not to leave her, promising she'd cut all contact with this guy. I just sat there staring at our wedding photo on the coffee table. The one where we're both laughing because my cousin Rick photobombed us making bunny ears. He looked so happy. So stupid. Emma grabbed my hands and asked if I could ever forgive her. And here's where I became a complete psychopath. I looked her dead in the eyes and said yes. I told her we could work through this, that our marriage was stronger than one mistake. All that bullshit you see in movies. But I was lying through my teeth. The next morning, I called in sick to work and drove straight to Jake's apartment. Found his address through Emma's Instagram. She tagged him at some restaurant last month. Dude answered the door in his boxers, looking all confused. I introduced myself as Emma's husband, And watched his face go white. Then I very calmly explained that I knew everything and that he had exactly 24 hours to quit his job and move out of town or I'd be paying visits to his parents, his ex girlfriend Sarah, who he was apparently trying to win back, and his boss, who definitely didn't know he was screwing around with married co workers. Jake started stuttering about how sorry he was, how it meant nothing. I just smiled and handed him a printed email I'd already drafted to his entire office explaining the situation. Told him this would be sent if he wasn't gone by Thursday. Meanwhile, at home, I was being the perfect forgiveness husband. Made Emma her favourite pasta dinner, bought her flowers, even suggested couples therapy. She was so relieved and grateful. Kept telling me how lucky she was to have such an understanding Husband. Thursday came and Jake was gone. Just like that. Emma came home from work all confused because apparently he'd quit without notice and moved back to Ohio or something. She kept asking why he just disappear like that. I waited exactly one more week, let her think we were rebuilding our trust. Then last Friday, I casually mentioned over breakfast that I changed my mind about the whole forgiveness thing. Her face went from confused to terrified in about two seconds. I told her I'd known.

My stylist will sort you out. I was hesitant because I'd never been to a black salon before, but honestly, my hair was so bad, I would have tried anything. Walking into that salon was like entering a whole different world. The energy was incredible. Everyone was talking, laughing, music playing, kids running around while their moms got their hair done.

Because they need to stop. She started running her fingers through it, asking me about my routine, what products I used, how I dried it. Nobody had ever asked me those questions before. They just wet it, cut it, and send me on my way. Miss Janet spent two hours on my Hair. Two hours. She deep conditioned it, trimmed each curl individually, showed me how to scrunch it properly, and sent me home with specific instructions about what products to use and how often to wash it.

So I went to this Applebee's last Friday night around eight PM I get seated at this booth near the back and my waiter comes over. Guy looked like he was in his early 20s, kind of scrawny with this patchy beard. He takes my drink order, just a Coke, and disappears. For like 15 minutes I'm sitting there looking around, watching other tables get their food and I'm still waiting for my damn soda. Finally, he shows up with my Coke, doesn't even apologize, just flops it down and asks what I want to eat. I order the chicken tenders with honey mustard and seasoned fries. Pretty basic stuff. He writes it down and vanishes again. 20 minutes go by, nothing. I can see him at the computer terminal just standing there scrolling on his phone. Other waiters are running around actually doing their jobs, but this guy is just chilling. I try to get his attention a couple times, but he's completely ignoring my section. After another 10 minutes, I flag down a different waitress, older lady with gray hair who looked like she actually cared about her job. I asked her if she knows what happened to my food order. She looks confused and goes to check. Turns out my waiter never even put my order in the system. The lady, her name tag said Janet, looked embarrassed as hell. She apologizes and immediately puts my order In says the kitchen will rush it. But now I've been sitting there for almost an hour with nothing but a warm Coke. My food finally comes out, but guess who brings it? Not my original waiter. Janet brings it over with another apology. The chicken tenders are overcooked and the fries are cold. At this point, I'm just hungry and tired, so I eat it anyway. The whole time I'm eating, I can see my waiter at the bar area talking to some girl who's clearly not working there. He's completely forgotten I exist. Never checked on me once after taking my drink order, never refilled my Coke, never even walked past my table. When I'm done eating, I have to wave down Janet again to get my check. He brings it over and I can tell she feels bad about the whole situation. The total was like 18 bucks. Here's where it gets interesting. Janet hands me the check and quietly says, don't worry about tipping Tommy. He didn't earn it tonight and everyone saw what happened. Apparently, this wasn't the first time this kid had pulled this crap. So I pay my $18 cash exact change and leave zero tip as I'm walking.

My 14 year old daughter started asking to sleep over at friends houses every weekend. And I thought it was just normal teenage social stuff. But then I noticed the pattern. Every Monday morning she'd come home looking absolutely destroyed. Dark circles so deep they looked like bruises. Shoulders hunched, dragging her feet like each step hurt. When I asked about the sleepovers, she'd just mumble it was fun and disappear into her room. Her math teacher emailed saying she had a panic attack during class when he'd casually asked about her weekend plans. Her violent teacher called to say she'd quit, just walked out mid lesson without explanation. She lost 10 pounds in just over a month. Her favourite jeans hung loose on her hips. She barely touched breakfast anymore. Started missing Sunday family dinners, events she'd never miss before, not even when she had the flu. My partner thought I was losing it. She's 14, Lisa. Girls have sleepovers. You're being paranoid. But when I was cleaning her room, I found energy drink cans stuffed behind her dresser, dozens of them. My sweet girl who used to drink nothing but herbal tea, my mom instincts weren't just whispering anymore, they were screaming. I started watching her more carefully. She'd get text on Friday afternoon and her whole body would change. Shoulders would tense up, face would go pale, hands would start trembling as she packed always the same overnight bag. But I Noticed something odd. Work gloves sticking out of the side pocket. No more family game nights on Saturdays. No more baking cookies together on Sunday mornings. No more asking me to braid her hair before bed. It was like she was being pulled away from us by some invisible force. One day I was passing her room when I heard her on the phone. Her voice was different, scared, desperate almost. I know, I know I'll be there, her voice cracked. I can't do this every weekend anymore. Please. A pause. No, I understand. I promise I won't tell anyone. Then I heard her crying. Real gut wrenching sobs that made my chest tighten. The next morning at breakfast, I asked casually, which friend's house are you going to tonight, honey? Her spoon clattered into her cereal bowl. Her eyes darted to her phone like it might save her. Just, just Marlene's. Her mom already said yes. But I called Marlene's mom last week. Marlene had been at her dad's house in another state for the past month. That's when I really started noticing her phone behaviour. When a specific notification sound played, just two quick beeps, her entire body would go rigid. Then she'd immediately delete whatever she'd seen. Something was very, very wrong with my daughter. I waited until she left for her sleepover that Saturday night. Then I did something I'd sworn I'd never do. I followed her. She didn't walk like a teenager heading to a Fun sleepover. She walked like someone heading to their execution, taking a weird winding route through the neighborhood, doubling back twice, constantly checking over her shoulder. At one point, she stopped completely, stood under a streetlight, and I watched her take deep, shuddering breaths like she was preparing for battle. She pulled out her phone and typed something. Even from my car, I could see her hands shaking as she hit send. The response must have been immediate because her shoulders slumped in defeat. Then she kept walking. What I discovered made my stomach drop to the floor. She didn't go.

In my family, we had something called Health Day. Every Saturday morning at 9:00am sharp. We'd finish breakfast and dad would already have the basement ready with his white coat on and all his medical equipment laid out on metal trays in the basement. Our mom would kiss our foreheads before sending us down one by one. Then came the examinations, thorough inspections of every inch of our bodies while he muttered medical terms and scrub golden thick glue binders. He'd make us stand naked under the bright lights while he circled us slowly, his gloved fingers pressing into our skin, checking what he called abnormalities. He called it preventative care. I dreaded it every single week. The rule was you couldn't flinch or complain or you'd start over from the beginning. The strangest part, we weren't allowed to mention health day at school, not to teachers, not to friends. I only realised in middle school how weird that was, how other kids just went to pediatricians once a year, not secret basement clinics every week. But the worst part was the special examinations. If dad found something concerning during the regular check, you'd get called down on weeknights. He had this small locked room with bright lights and an exam table with stirrups. The metal was always cold and he'd spend what felt like hours with his instruments documenting every detail while telling us to relax and breathe. He said it was For comprehensive assessment. As a kid, I was terrified. I'd count the ceiling tiles over and over. But dad said fear meant you were taking your health seriously. When I got older, I started questioning everything. Why did we need weekly exams when no one else did? Why did mom drink before every health day? I remember once at 14, I asked if I could skip it for Rachel's sleepover. Dad gripped my wrist and stared at me with these desperate eyes. Health day is the only thing keeping you safe, he said. That's when I knew something was deeply wrong. Rachel's family had annual checkups, vaccination schedules, growth charts on the edge. No basement procedures, no locked rooms, no binders documenting their bodies, just normal healthcare. I finally refused to go downstairs when I turned 16. Dad went ballistic, screaming that I was ungrateful and didn't understand the dangers. Mom just stood there shaking. He locked me in my room and said I couldn't leave until I submitted to a full examination. The next morning, mom slipped me $20 under the door and whispered to use the window. When I came back that night, dad acted like nothing had happened. He just asked if I was ready for my examination like he hadn't imprisoned me the night before. That's when I started planning. Still, the whole thing ate at me. Why was dad so obsessed with our health when he wasn't even a doctor? Where did he get all That equipment. Three months later, I told my health teacher everything. Missus Patterson kept her face very still as I explained our Saturday routine. She said she needed to make a phone call. I knew what that meant. She came back with the principal. Then the police came, then Child Services. They took us out of class one by one, just like health day, except this time, we didn't go home. I'll never forget Dad's face when they arrested him. Not angry, just broken. I was protecting them, he kept saying. The officers found the binders, dozens.

He got me and threw me away. My mom once told me when she was pregnant with me, she prayed for a boy. She already had two sons, but my dad wanted just one more son. He talked about it like he was building a team. But when I was born and the nurse said, it's a girl. My dad didn't even come near me. He walked out of the room. Didn't talk to my mom for two days. She laughed when she told me that I didn't. That moment set the tone for the rest of my life. My brothers were treated like kings. My dad took them to fancy schools, bought them new bikes, and always made sure they had the best. I was sent to a small, poor government school. No library, broken chairs, big classes. But I worked hard anyway. I studied under street lights when the power went out. And somehow I got better grades than all of them. But even when I came home with medals and top marks, they brushed it off. My grandma once said, smart girls are still just girls. My dad said, let's see what she does with all that studying. Girls just end up in kitchens anyway. Still, I kept pushing. At 18, I got a full scholarship for writing. I was the first one in the whole family to earn that kind of opportunity. I brought the letter home, heart racing. My mom Smiled softly. My dad glanced at it and said, so you're finally leaving? I packed my bags. No hugs, no goodbyes. I left like I had lived quietly in the city. I worked hard, got a part time job at a bookstore to help with rent, wrote at night. Graduated with honors. Then I found a job in publishing. Not huge, but enough to live. And somehow, along the way, I found the

I first noticed them in the cereal aisle, a well dressed woman carrying a crying little girl, maybe 3 years old. The child's face was red, tears streaming. But something about her cries seemed desperate, different, not like a tantrum. I'm a kindergarten teacher. After 15 years, you develop a sense for these things. The woman kept whispering. It's okay, sweetie, almost there. But she wasn't doing any of the natural things a parent does. No rubbing the back, no gentle bouncing, no terms of endearment that felt personal. I followed at a distance, pretending to shop. The girl's cries started changing, becoming more panicked. I want my mommy, she whispered. You said Mommy was here. The woman shifted uncomfortably. We are, honey. Just a few more things. Her eyes darted to the exits. When they reached the dairy section, I saw another woman with a cart full of groceries. She was younger, probably early 30s, talking frantically on her phone. I don't know, John. She was right here. I just turned around for a second to grab her juice. He knows not to wander off. No. She was wearing her favourite butterfly clip. The purple and silver one. Yes. And her yellow polka dot dress. My stomach dropped. The crying girl was wearing exactly that, a yellow polka dot dress and a butterfly hair clip, purple and silver, just like the one the younger woman was now Clutching in her free hand, I stepped closer to them, acting like I was reaching for milk. The girls next words confirmed everything Mommy had.

Alison couldn't let anyone else have their moment. At our cousin Jamie's beach wedding, she grabbed the mic during posts to announce her divorce. During our cousin Alex's first dance, she loudly told everyone at our table she was pregnant. At my best friend's reception, she stood on a chair during the cake cutting to reveal she was moving to Paris. That moment of chaos at her reception was nothing compared to what awaited me three months later at my wedding. Everything was going perfectly until the speeches started. My maid of honor was halfway through her beautiful toast when Alison stood up. She clinked her glass dramatically and walked to the front. She took the microphone right out of my friend's hand. Sorry, but I have something important to share while everyone's here. She announced, pulled her boyfriend, Craig up beside her. She told the entire room they were adopting a baby from Korea. My guest erupted in confused congratulations while my maid of honor stood there holding her speech cards uselessly. The rest of my reception became the Alison Show. People kept coming up to her for details about the adoption. Someone started a collection for baby supplies using the envelope box meant for our cards. The photographer spent 20 minutes doing an impromptu photo shoot of her and Craig. My mom found me crying in the bathroom and told Me? I was being dramatic. She just excited about becoming a mother. She said you should be happy for family. My aunt agreed that Alison was just enthusiastic about sharing good news. Two months later, at Sunday dinner, Alison announced her wedding date. She went on and on about her vintage Hollywood glamour theme. She'd already booked the historic Grandview Manor downtown. Craig sat there nodding while she showed everyone her Pinterest boards. I want it to be absolutely perfect, she gushed. No interruptions or distractions, just all eyes on us for once. The irony nearly choked me, but I smiled and said it sounded lovely. That night, I started planning. Allison's fatal flaw was her complete blindness to her own behavior. She genuinely believed she was just sharing joy. She couldn't understand why anyone would mind. She also had zero ability to handle competition for attention. I reached out to my college theater friends first. My roommate, Macy ran an improv group that specialized in flash mobs and public performances. When I explained my idea, she literally cackled delight. Within a week, I had 12 performers committed to the cause. The tricky part was getting them into the wedding. I studied Allison's guest list when she left it at my mom's house. Several couples had generic plus one RSVPs. Macy's performers could pose as dates for single guests. I knew. I reached out to these friends and explained the situation. Every single one wanted to help. After hearing about My wedding, the wedding was as over the top as expected. Allison had seven bridesmaids and released stubs during the ceremony. The reception ballroom dripped with crystals and white roses. My performers were scattered perfectly throughout the room as planned guests, everything started during dinner service. At exactly 6:30, Macy stood up at table four and let out a shriek. Her fake boyfriend was on one knee between the salad and soup courses. The whole room turned to watch as she said yes. He slipped a costume jewelry ring on her finger. Alison's smile froze, but she started clapping along with everyone else at 6:45 during the champagne toast.

But her reaction shocked everyone in the room. For three years, I've been walking on eggshells around David. The slap started small. A quick backhand when dinner was cold, a shove when I disagreed with him, always behind closed doors. Always followed by apologies and promises it would never happen again. His mother had been visiting for the weekend and I'd been trying so hard to be the perfect wife. Margaret Morrison was everything I wasn't. Polished, educated from old money. She made it clear from the beginning that I wasn't good enough for her son. The girl from the wrong side of town who trapped her precious boy with an unplanned pregnancy that we lost three months into our marriage. Made her favourite meals, cleaned the house twice and bit my tongue when she criticized everything from my cooking to my outfit choices. She had this way of looking at me like I was a stain on her expensive furniture. The explosion came over something stupid. I'd accidentally used the good China for lunch instead of saving it for dinner. It was an honest mistake. I've been so nervous about impressing her that I grabbed the wrong plates from the cabinet. David's face went red the moment he saw the delicate porcelain. What the hell is wrong with you? He said, his voice low and dangerous. I specifically told you those were for tonight when the Hendersons come over. I'm sorry. I whispered, already reaching to clear the table with shaking hands. I'll wash them carefully and reset everything with the everyday dishes. His mother was sitting right there, sipping her tea like nothing was happening. I thought maybe her presence would keep him calm. I'd never been more wrong about anything in my life. David grabbed my wrist so hard I felt the bones grind together. You never listen, do you? You're too stupid to follow simple instructions. How many times do I have to explain things before they penetrate that thick skull of yours? I tried to pull away, but his grip tightened until tears sprang to my eyes. Please, I said quietly, glancing nervously at his mother. You're hurting me. His mother continued drinking her tea, her face completely expressionless. No help was coming from that direction. That's when he did it. Right in front of his mother, right in the middle of their pristine dining room with its crystal chandelier and mahogany table, he drew back his hand and slapped me across the face so hard my ears rang and I tasted blood. I stood there stunned, my cheek burning like fire, waiting for his mother to gasp or object or do something, anything. She'd always been so proper, so concerned with appearances and social etiquette. Instead, she set down her teacup with a delicate clink and looked directly at her son. The sound seemed to echo in the sudden silence. David Anthony Morrison, she said. Her Voice cutting through the silence like a blade. What did you just do? Something in her

Now I'm just like, I wish I never found out. But you did find out and I imagine your conscience is eating away at you about this. Yeah, yeah, yes, it is. But I just wish there was a way she could find out without me being involved at all. Well, I mean, you called us, so you're pretty much involved now. Um, but if you want to, we could plan a way where maybe he admits to it while she's listening on the phone and then he doesn't know like, would that work? Maybe, maybe you call him and ask him about it. But we're listening on the other line and we have her on the other and she, and he has no idea she's listening. Well, see, that means I'm, I'm pretty much losing the friend for life cause he's gonna know I set him up and I don't want that. I gotcha. Okay. Maybe we can figure out a way to get him to admit it without even using you at all. Um, give me a few minutes on this one either way I think we're gonna need to get Beth on the phone cause she obviously needs to hear this now do you do you have her number? Uh, my and my girlfriend has it okay, wait I'll go get it okay, I need you to get that number and then get his number too when we come back I think I have a plan that may or may not involve America's No. 1 rated fake morning show Scotty and the buzz oh god yeah here's what I'm thinking tell me if you like this idea okay, what if we pretend we're calling from Scotty in the bus show but we never do Scotty in the bus what if I say great idea great idea so I don't have to hear the voice I'm the producer of Scotty in the buzz show and we got a call from this Dario girl who said I slept with my ex and and we wanted to clear it with you before we put her on the air kind of like getting confirmation like yes, yep yeah, permission okay yeah and then maybe he'll go so you basically gonna do my job if that's okay with you but you your job was to get Beth did you get her? Yep. And what line is she on? Line 2. Okay, I'm gonna sit back and judge no, I'm just kidding I mean we all do don't We, that's what this is all about.

When I landed the contract for the mayor's daughter's wedding, a 50 thousand dollar gig she'd been courting for months, Emma's congratulations text was ice cold. Three weeks before the wedding, things got weird. My Instagram started hemorrhaging followers, 500 vanishing. Overnight. Negative reviews appeared on Google from clients I'd never worked with. Someone reported my business license as fraudulent. Annoying, but I figured it was just bad luck. Then disaster struck. The mayor's assistant called me, voice trembling with barely contained fury. We need to discuss the email you sent email, the one where you called the bride, and I quote, a bridezilla nightmare who should be grateful anyone would photograph her Walmart level wedding. My blood turned to ice. I never sent that email, but there it was, forwarded to me from my professional email address at 3:47 a. M. The previous night. The mayor's family was demanding I be fired immediately and they were considering legal action for defamation. Emma, coincidentally had already reached out to them offering her services as an emergency replacement. What Emma didn't know was that six months earlier, after a previous photographer friend had their career destroyed by mysterious leaked emails, I'd installed advanced tracking software on all my devices, not just basic antivirus, forensic level monitoring that logged every keystroke, IP address and remote access attempt. The mayor's assistant gave me 24 hours to explain myself before they Went public with the scandal. Emma had already screen shot the email and was preparing to share it with our entire professional network to warn them about my unprofessionalism. That evening, Emma organized an intervention. She'd invited 12 of our mutual photographer friends to my studio, plus the president of our local photography association and even my biggest client, the owner of a luxury hotel chain who booked me monthly. We're here because we care about you, Emma said, tears streaming down her face. But you need to admit what you did and get help. This kind of jealous lashing out isn't like you. She'd printed copies of the email for everyone. It even made a Powerpoint presentation titled Addressing Toxic Behavior in our community. Actually, I said, pulling out my laptop, let's talk about toxic behavior. The tracking software had caught everything. At 3:00am, someone had used a VPN to mask their IP address and access my email through a password reset. But VPNs don't hide device fingerprints and the software had captured something beautiful, the unique identify.

She suddenly remembered I existed. My girlfriend dragged me to Bradley's birthday party at the downtown bar, but spent the entire pregame listing all the ways Bradley would have handled things better. Bradley got everyone VIP tables for his birthday, she said, scrolling through his Instagram. He just knows how to make things special. And look at his new promotion post, youngest VP in his company's history. The second we walked through the door, she immediately started her routine. See how Bradley's already bought everyone around, she said, roughly adjusting my collar. That's called generosity. He makes six figures and still remembers his friends. I watched her as she made her way to Bradley. He was the former college quarterback, now investment VP, and still looked like he stepped out of the cover of Vogue. You look like you need this more than me, said a voice beside me. A brunette in a black dress held out a whiskey. Marilyn from Bradley's office, someone I'd only met once at his promotion dinner. I'm more of a wine person anyway. Thanks, I said, taking the drink. Bradley's parties are always overwhelming, she said, settling into her chair like she planned to stay. All that aggressive networking disguised as fun. She turned toward me. You're the teacher, right? Yeah, I teach middle school. God, that's brave. Seventh graders are feral, she Laughed, moving her chair closer. I bet you have the best stories, though. We started talking about my students while Bradley held court across the bar. Real interest asking about lesson plans and classroom management. She actually listened to the answers. So you basically perform for 30 teenagers all day, Marilyn asked, her knee brushing mine. That takes serious charisma. I die, she leaned in. Plus the patience. I can barely handle one Powerpoint presentation without wanting to scream. My chest felt warm. I couldn't believe someone was actually asking about my work instead of why I didn't make more money. I can tell you love teaching, she smiled. You light up talking about it. It's a attractive when someone's passionate about something meaningful. Her hand touched my arm. Not like these finance bros talking about hedge funds like they're saving the world. From across the bar, I noticed my girlfriend glancing over while pretending to laugh at Bradley's story. Her eyes narrowed slightly. Your girlfriend seems nice, Marilyn said, following my gaze, though I'm surprised she's not over here with you. She prefers Bradley's stories. Marilyn scoffed like she couldn't understand why, right? I've heard her talk about him at office parties. She paused. Actually, she talks about him a lot. Like a lot. A lot. That's.

Emma had always been the attention seeking sister. When I got engaged to Tyler, she immediately started planning ways to make my wedding about her. She dropped hints about how she wished someone would propose to her, how she was getting older, how weddings made her so emotional. I ignored most of it because I was too busy planning the actual wedding. Two weeks before the big day, Emma casually mentioned she'd found the perfect dress. She showed me a photo on her phone. It was clearly white. Not cream, not ivory, not off white. Pure white with lace details that looked almost bridal. Emma, that's a white dress. I said, it's champagne. She lied, even though we could both see it was white. You can't wear white to my wedding. Oh, please, it's 2024. Those rules are so outdated. Besides, it'll look different in photos. I told my mom, who just sighed and said Emma would probably change her mind. I told my maid of honor, Katie, who offered to spill wine on Emma if needed. But honestly, I was too stressed with last minute wedding planning to fight about it. The morning of my wedding, I was getting ready in the bridal suite when Katie burst in. Your sister just walked in wearing that white dress, and it's worse than the photo. I looked out the window and saw Emma Posing for photos with our cousins. The dress was absolutely white, floor length, and had this dramatic train. She looked like she was trying to be a second bride. But here's where it gets good. My husband's family is Italian, and his grandmother, Nona Rosa, takes traditions very seriously. She's this tiny 85 year old woman who doesn't speak much English, but somehow always knows what's happening. During the ceremony, I could see Nona Rosa staring at Emma with this look of pure disgust. After we set our vows during the cocktail hour, Nona Rosa marched straight up to Emma. You wear white to someone else's wedding, she said in her broken English, loud enough for everyone nearby to hear.

Well, I mean, you called us, so you're pretty much involved now. Um, but if you want to, we could plan a way where maybe he admits to it while she's listening on the phone and then he doesn't know. Like, would that work? Maybe, maybe you call him and ask him about it. But we're listening on the other line and we have her on the other and she, and he has no idea she's listening. Well, see, that means I'm, I'm pretty much losing the friend for life cause he's Gonna know I set him up and I don't want that I gotcha okay, maybe we can figure out a way to get him to admit it without even using you at all um, give me a few minutes on this one either way I think we're gonna need to get Beth on the phone cause she obviously needs to hear this now do you do you have her number?

In our family, when a husband dies, the widow has exactly 40 days to follow him into the afterlife. They called it the Eternal Service. Packed because apparently men needed servants even after death. I was seven when I watched my Aunt Ling drink the ceremonial poison at Uncle Ling's 40th Day memorial. Her hands shook as she raised the cup, but her mother in law held her wrist steady, making sure every drop went down. Aunt May was 23. She tried to run on day 38. Made it all the way to the bus station before Uncle Ling's brothers dragged her back. I remember her begging, saying she was pregnant. They said the baby could serve Uncle Ling, too. My mom would brush my hair every night and tell me how romantic it was that wives love their husbands so much they couldn't live without them. But I saw the way her hands trembled. Whenever dad got a cold, I saw her counting his gray hairs. Like she was calculating how many years she had left. Sometimes I catch her staring at the kitchen knives. Not in a scary every way, but like she was measuring which one would be sharpest in 20 years. The thing about this tradition was it wasn't even that old. My great grandfather started it after his brother's widow remarried someone younger and prettier. He said it was about loyalty, but Everyone knew it was about control. Dead women can't inherit property. Dead women can't remarry. Dead women can't testify about what their husbands did to them. Dead women can't tell anyone about the bruises hidden under their funeral clothes. The ceremonies were always the same day. 40 would arrive and the whole family would gather. The widow would wear white, her husband's favorite address. She'd serve tea to his relatives one last time. Then they bring out the cup. Always porcelain, always with painted flowers. The poison smelled like almonds. They'd make her drink it in front of everyone, then lay her next to her husband's photo until she stopped breathing. Usually it took about 20 minutes. The younger kids were supposed to watch to learn about duty. When I was 15, Dad had a heart attack. That he survived, but it changed everything. Mom started acting differently. She'd wake me up at 3:00am for lessons. First, she taught me how to forge signatures, making me practice Dad's name until I could do it perfectly. Then came the banking stuff. How to transfer money without triggering alerts. How to hide assets in different names. She showed me websites for fake IDS. Taught me which states were easiest to disappear in. Made me memorize bus routes to the Mexican border. Just in case you ever need to disappear, she'd say. But we both knew who really needed to disappear. Then she showed me the videos. She been collecting them for years. Grainy footage of widow ceremonies from old family gatherings. She had them hidden on an encrypted hard drive labelled recipe collection. She'd pause at certain moments. Look at Aunt Ling's cup. See how it's different from Aunt May's, she'd say. Look at Aunt Lou's funeral. Notice how the coffin is so light when they carry it. Look at how her sister keeps checking her phone during the burial. That's when I Learned about the secret network. For 20 years, widows have been faking their deaths. Some use special drugs that slow their heartbeat to nothing for 48 hours. One aunt was a nurse who'd been stealing them from the hospital for years. Others had doctor friends who falsified death certificates for cash. There was a whole underground railroad of safe houses in other states where dead women started new lives. They had new name, new social security numbers, new everything. Mom taught me the code words at family gatherings. Such a peaceful passing meant the widow escaped successfully. She fought till the end. Meant someone was suspicious. Beautiful ceremony meant they needed help with documents. The flowers were perfect. Meant they needed money. She's with him now. Meant she didn't make it out. I started helping when I was 17. Creating fake

My mom would go through my backpack every single day when I got home from school, checking my homework like I was in third grade. She'd read my text messages whenever she felt like it, and if I complained, she'd take my phone away for a week. My dad wasn't much better. He had this rule where I couldn't leave the house after six PM, even on weekends. If I wanted to hang out with friends, I had to give them a full essay about where I was going, who would be there, and when I'd be back. The final straw was when they installed one of those tracking apps on my phone without telling me. I only found out because my friend Jake mentioned seeing my location pop up when he was trying to text me. I confronted them about it that night, and my mom just shrugged and said it was for my safety. My dad backed her up, saying as long as I lived under their roof, I followed their rules. Been working at this pizza place since I turned 16, saving up every paycheck except for what I needed for gas and lunch money. By the time I graduated high school, I had almost $4,000 saved up. I started looking at apartments online during my lunch breaks, telling myself I was just browsing. But the More I thought about it, the more I realized I could actually do this. Found this tiny studio apartment about 20 minutes from my job. The rent was only 600 a month, and the landlord said if I could prove I had a steady income and pay first month plus deposit, he'd rent to me. I went to look at it on a day my parents thought I was at work. It was small and kind of dingy, but it was mine. I filled out the application that same day. Two weeks later, he called and said I was approved. I could move in the following weekend. That's when it hit me that I was actually doing this. I felt sick to my stomach, but also kind of excited. I started slowly moving my stuff out. Every day after work, I'd grab a backpack full of clothes or books and stash them in my car. I told my parents I was staying late to help close the restaurant, which wasn't totally a lie, since I was picking up extra shifts to make sure I could afford everything. The hardest part was getting my bigger stuff out. I waited until they went to my aunt's house for Sunday dinner, something I'd gotten out of by saying I had to work. I loaded up my car with my dresser, my desk, and my T V. Left most of the furniture since it wasn't really mine anyway. But I took the stuff that Mattered. I left them a note on the kitchen counter. I kept it simple. Told them I'd moved out, that I was safe, and that I'd call them in a few days when I was settled. I said I needed space to figure out who I was as an adult and that I hoped they'd understand eventually. I left my house key next to the note. My phone started blowing up around 8 that night. Missed calls, texts, voicemails. My mom was crying, and half of them, my dad was yelling in the others. They wanted to know where I was, if I was okay, why I didn't talk to them first. They said they'd always supported me and couldn't understand why I do this to them. I turned my phone off and didn't turn it back on until the next morning. I had 37 missed calls and way too many texts to read through. I called them back and told them I was fine. Gave them my address and said they could come see my place if they wanted. My mom showed up.

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he'd just say, what's next, Sir, one Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right?

And it doesn't matter. Like, bro, real friends don't need to be in the same classroom or even the same postcode to stay tight. You could be across the city in a different uniform learning completely different subjects, but somehow the bond never fades. Everyone else is like, oh, if you don't go to the same school, you'll drift apart. Nah, bro, not us. I could be sitting in math class stressed out over equations I'll never use in life, and you're across town doing science experiments and we're still texting dumb memes like we saw each other five minutes ago. And when we do link up on the weekend, it's like we never left. No awkward vibes, no weird energy, just straight vibes, bro. We might not be in the same school, but we've got the same mindset, same humour, same jokes, same energy. And the best part, when you meet their school friends and suddenly you feel famous, like, oh, you're that friend they always talk about, yeah, that's me. I don't even go here, but I run this friendship. So if you've got a friend that's in another school but still feels closer than anyone in your class, appreciate that. That's real friendship. Forget proximity. It's about loyalty.

But what she didn't know was that I am the owner. Last Saturday night, this woman storms into my restaurant with five friends, completely bypassing our host stand. She's wearing designer everything and has this entitled smirk that immediately puts me on edge. I need the VIP section, she announces loudly enough for half the dining room to hear. The owner's my college roommate, tell him Jessica Martinez is here. He always keeps table 7 open for me. I'm standing right there in my server apron, having just finished helping bus tables during our Saturday rush. I've owned this place for three years and have never seen this woman in my life, but something about her smugness made me genuinely curious about how far she'd take this lie. Let me check with management, I tell her, suppressing a grin. While she waits, Jessica starts telling her friends how she practically designed the menu and helped me get this place off the ground. Pure fiction. But her friends are eating it up, taking selfies and posting about their VIP treatment. I decide to seat them at table 7, our actual premium table with no listed prices, reserved for celebrity guests and special occasions. The menus I give them are our exclusive tasting collection, featuring items like Wagyu beef, ported lobster, and bottles of wine that cost more Than most people's rent. Oh my god, he gave us the good menus! Jessica squeals to her friends. See, I told you we were tight. While serving them, Jessica keeps making increasingly bold claims. She tells everyone how she helped me choose the restaurant's color scheme, how she introduced me to my celebrity clients, how I always comp for meals because she's basically a business partner. The breaking point came when she snapped her fingers at me and said, waiter, boy, this champagne isn't expensive enough for my friends. Bring us your most exclusive bottle. You know, the one you save for me. That's when I brought out our 1 200 dollar Dom Perignon vintage, 2000 thousand and eight. Jessica didn't even blink, just waved her hand dismissively and told her friends, he always brings me the good stuff. Throughout the evening, they ordered like money was no object. Appetizers of a select caviar, multiple bottles of premium wine, dry aged steaks, and desserts paired with rare cognac. Jessica kept live streaming parts of the dinner, bragging to her social media followers about her exclusive access and VIP lifestyle. The most insulting moment came when one of her friends asked,

The Coast Guard had been hunting narcotic runners in Miami waters all summer. And with my dark skin and old fishing boat, I looked like every dealer they profiled. I looked so suspicious that Marina security trailed me to my slip every time. Harbour patrol always circled twice when they saw me with my kids. So when the Coast Guard's cutter aimed straight at us, I knew we were targets. Screamed over the loud speaker while still 50 yards out. Cut engines now! My eight year old started crying. The Coast Guard jumped aboard before my daughter's tears dried. He circled me like a shark while three guardsmen kept hands on weapons. His eyes locked onto my Navy anchor tattoo. The Coast Guard made me lift my shirt and traced his finger over my combat scars from Syria. Then he turned to my kids huddled in the corner. My daughter buried her face in her brother's shoulder. The Coast Guard pointed at them and laughed. Teaching them the family business early, huh? He grabbed my arm and twisted it behind my back. The other Guardsmen just watched. My son reached for me, but I shook my head. The moment I shook my head at my son, The Coast Guard grabbed my shoulder. He put me down to my knees hard. The Coast Guard stood over me and started his lecture. He told my kids their daddy, Was a nobody, a narcotic dealer, a waste of space. When I quietly mentioned serving in naval intelligence, he bent down close. Bullshit. Maybe a dishwasher on base. He tore my shirt while pretending to search for track marks. The Coast Guard examined my scars and shook his head. My daughter heard every word. My son's fists clenched, but he stayed frozen. My children watched him tear apart their father, piece by piece. The Coast Guard pulled out his cuffs and made a show of it. He clicked them on tight while my kids stared. My eight year old reached for me, but Coast Guard stepped between us. He blocked her with his body and she stumbled backward. Her little hands shook. The Coast Guard looked at both my children and then back at me. He shook his head slowly like he was disappointed. Then he spit on the deck right next to where I knelt. What kind of father brings kids on narcotic runs? My son pulled his sister close. Then he spotted the decorated urn wedged between in our fishing poles. The brass caught the sunlight. I tried explaining through tears. My father. Vietnam Purple Heart. Today's memorial. The Coast Guard just laughed and pop the lid. He held it over the water. I lurched forward, but the stop me. He tilted it slowly at first, then dumped everything. The ashes hit the waves and spread out like a gray cloud. My daughter broke free and ran to The rail! Grandpa! She reached toward the water. The Coast Guard stepped back and smiled. The Coast Guard stepped back and smiled while my daughter cried for her grandpa. I lost it. Tried to stand, but he tackled me into the railing. My ribs cracked against the metal. He grabbed my neck and forced my head over the side into the same water where my father's ashes floated. He held me under. I fought, but the cuffs made it impossible. Gonna join your narcotic dealer, daddy? Down there? My children screamed. He yanked me up, gasping. Water poured from my mouth, then down again. Kids are better off without you. My eight year old begged him to stop. The other guardsmen look sick, but stayed frozen. My body went limp just as a Navy patrol boat roared up. The captain stood with binoculars locked on us. He grabbed his radio and his voice boomed across the water. That's Commander Williams, Naval Intelligence.

I'm sitting at my reserved table at this fancy Italian place when a couple walks up and says, excuse me, you're at our table. I politely tell them I have a seven PM reservation under my name. The woman rolls her eyes and says, as well, we have one too and we were here first. I show them my confirmation email. The guy gets aggressive. Look, we eat here every week. The hostess knows us. You need to move, the woman adds. We tip really well here. They know to take care of us. I refuse and say I'm not moving for my confirmed reservation. The guy starts raising his voice. This is ridiculous. We're regulars. Other diners start looking over. The woman notices and it's louder. Can you believe this? Some people have no courtesy. I flag down our waitress, hoping she'll check the reservation system. She walks over looking nervous. The couple immediately pounces, thank god you're here. This person took our usual table. The waitress looks between us awkwardly, oh, there might have been a mix up. Maybe you could sit at the bar. The couple smurfs like they've won. The woman crosses her arms. See, even she knows this is our table. The guy adds, we've been coming here for three years, same table every Friday. I'm getting heated, but stay calm and ask the waitress to check her system. He hesitates and says, well, they Are very good customers, the woman jumps in. Exactly. We spend serious money here, not like some random walk in. I tell her I'm not a walk in and show my confirmation. Again, the guy dismisses it. Anyone can fake an email these days. The woman suggests, why don't you just go somewhere else? There are plenty of other restaurants. Other customers are now openly staring at the scene. One couple at the next table starts whispering. The waitress looks uncomfortable and suggests again, the bar has really nice seating, same menu. The guy nods approving. Perfect solution. Everyone's happy. I refuse to budge and ask to speak to the manager. The woman laughs. Oh, please. He knows us personally. The guy adds. We had dinner with him last month. Good luck with that. The waitress says the manager is busy in the kitchen. The couple exchanges knowing looks. The woman leans in. Look, we can make this easy. Easy or hard, your choice. I ask what that means. The guy explains, we know the owner. One word from us and you'll never get a table here again. I stand my ground and say I'm keeping my legally reserved table. The couple gets more aggressive. The woman starts talking to nearby tables. Can you believe some people? No respect for loyalty? The guy joins. In three years we've been coming here, this is what customer service has become. A man at another table nods sympathetic. The woman turns back to Me, last chance, move or we'll make sure everyone knows how selfish you are. That's when I pull out my phone and call the restaurant right there in front of everyone. Hi, this is Johnny. I made a reservation for seven PM under Johnson. There's some confusion about my table. The couple's confidence wavers slightly. The guy I whispers, what is he doing? The hostess who seated the couple answers. I put it on speaker so everyone can hear. Oh, Mister Johnson, yes, table 12 is definitely yours. Wait, someone else.

For as long as I could remember, my younger brother Garrett had been insecure about being weak and scrawny. The LaCrosse team would shove him into lockers daily, calling him Twig Boy. The worst was when he couldn't open a water bottle at lunch and his crush Emily laughed, asking the guy next to her, Garrett's too weak. He needs a man to help him. I always felt bad for him. But the day he discovered one punch man, everything changed. He burst into my room holding his phone showing me Saitama's transformation. Look, he was just like me, a weak, bullied nobody. Then he did the simple training and became the strongest hero alive. I was just happy he found something that gave him hope. The very next morning, Garrett started Saitama's routine religiously, 100 push UPS, 100 sit UPS, 100 squats and a 10 kilometer run every single day. Within two months, his arms showed actual definition and his chest filled out his shirts, the LaCrosse team stopped shoving him around completely. While mom bought him protein powder and dad installed a pull up bar. Look at my dedicated boy. She'd beam at dinner when he shaved his head bald, the school counselor pulled me aside. Whatever is motivating him, it's working. His grades are up, confidence through the roof. Even I was impressed when he bench pressed his body wait for the first time. The best part was Emily starting to notice watching him do pull UPS after school and asking about his anime workout. He flex and quote Sidema, I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun. We all laughed because he was finally becoming the person he wanted to be. But as months passed, things shifted when Garrett demanded everyone call him Sidema. Refusing to Garrett anymore. Teachers got email signed Sidema while he begged mom to legally change his name. When you're 18, she said, this is just a phase. Soon after, he quit soccer because Sidema trained alone and his knuckles stayed permanently stabbed from painting concrete walls in our basement. I'm removing my limiters, he explained, wrapping them in bloody gauze. Now deadlifting 300 pounds, his frame had exploded from 130 to 200 pounds of pure muscle with veins sneaking up his arms like cables. When I tried talking to him about my concerns, he brushed me off. You're getting too intense about this. The whole point is to push past human limits. He showed me his training journal filled with detailed power rankings, strength measurements and notes about breaking through with page after page of Sidema quotes highlighted in yellow. After he passed out doing squats, mom attempted an intervention. Honey, you need rest days. Tama never rested. That's why he transcended. He stormed out to run his 10 kilometer run at midnight. Then the mall incident started a week later when he began picking fights, asking random guys to test His power level until security banned him after the third confrontation. His fist now bore a tattoo reading one punch in bold letters across the knuckles. Six months into his transformation, Garrett looked like a bodybuilder who'd swallowed another bodybuilder. At 220 pounds of carved muscle with shoulders so wide he turned sideways through doorways. We were driving to get groceries on a normal Tuesday morning when he saw a cop conducting a routine traffic stop on the shoulder. Pull over, he said with deadly calm in his voice. What? No, we need to pull over. He grabbed the wheel. This is it, my moment. I pulled over. With shaking hands as he got out and walked toward the officer with purpose. The cop immediately tensed with his hand moving to his whole.

I admit it, I messed up. I had forgotten my phone was on silent. And so for two hours straight, I sweated my butt off on Smash Bros at my friend's house and forgot to text my girlfriend Cindy back. So when I finally saw her, 15 missed calls, she was furious. I need to know you're actually where you say you are, she said, but I already sent you my location and a picture of us on the coach. It's not enough. What if there are girls hiding behind you on the couch or what if it's just an old picture? I'm not stupid, Trent. From now on when you're out, we video call so I can see or you can wake up single. The next day she hung up practically foaming at the mouth. The first few calls were painfully awkward. I'd have to go around the house, introduce each of my friends to her, basically give her a house tour to show it's all clear before she hang up and randomly call again in the next hour or so to make sure I didn't change locations or invited over girls to my friend's house. After a few days like this, everyone was going crazy over her rule. My friend Jeff pulled me to the side with a concerned look. Dude, honestly, if she's gonna act crazy, you gotta do it too. That's When it came to me, a brilliant idea. The next time I was at Jeff's house, I answered Cindy's call in my best David Attenborough voice. Here we observe the male human in his natural habitat approaching the buffalo wings. With caution, I slowly turned the camera towards my friends who immediately caught on and started acting like wildlife. In the background, dinner was pretending to be a gazelle and Jeff was chest beating like a gorilla. Very funny, Cindy said, rolling her eyes at us. The next Friday, we took it further. I answered the call holding a microphone, reading out a fake weather forecast while Jeff held up a map glued to a pizza box. Currently, we're experiencing a high pressure system of Mario Kart moving through the living room area, I announced. Temperatures are rising as we travel through Rainbow Road. Now back to you, Cindy. Stop being weird, Cindy said. Just show me where you are and who's with you. I went around the room pulling each friend into a news interview, asking random questions about incidents that never happened. Cindy hung up before the second interview could even begin. Then at dinner's birthday dinner the following week, I went full cooking show host. Hello and welcome. Tonight's restaurant special is pasta with what appears to be some kind of red sauce. Locals like to call it spaghetti. My friends jumped in as sous chefs, with one describing the texture of the breadsticks. Another rated the Seasoning. Some people at the restaurant gave weird looks. Others started watching and laughing. Cindy lashed out. No more performances. But we couldn't stop, not without one last banger. That night, every single friend was there at my apartment for game night. What are you guys up to, I asked, watching them carry in different costumes. Jeff grinned. Don't worry about it, he said. All secretive, exchanging suspicious glances at each other. This time, I had no clue what was up. So when Cindy called, I answered, completely normal. Hey, babe, just playing games with the guys. She was immediately suspicious, narrowing her eyes. Why are you being so normal? What are you planning? Honestly, I didn't plan anything tonight other than play video games. Just as I panned the camera over to my friends, Jeff stood up behind me and shouted with a strong Spanish accent, Maria, how could you betray me with my twin brother? Tom emerged from the kitchen in a wedding dress, blonde wig and red lipstick that looked like a toddler applied it. I did nothing with your twin because I'm in love with the doctor. Before Cindy could process what was happening, dinner burst through the bedroom door wearing my bathrobe and a bad mustache made from electrical tape. That is right, Mi amigo. She is in love with me and we shall elope on the back of our family donkey and marry on top of El Castillo and Yucatan. Cindy and I stood there. With our mouths hung open, fully immersed in their 10 minute telenovela they called The Passions of Game Night, complete with a written script, costume changes, a random man playing dramatic Spanish guitar music in the background, all ending with the characters getting amnesia out of nowhere. Jeff even got slapped 17 times, falling and getting up dramatically each time. It was glorious. When the telenovela finally ended with Jeff ascending to heaven on a ladder while wearing angel wings made of paper plates, Cindy was silent for a full 10 seconds. Okay, she finally said, bursting into laughter, you win. That was just unbelievable. But I get it. The rule was ridiculous too. So let's just go back to normal. Texts, keep me updated. No more house tours. No more proving I'm not hiding some random woman in kitchen cabinets, I teased. She grinned. Yes, if you guys can put this much effort into proving a point, I doubt you'd be out there doing all that again for another crazy girl. But the thing was, it didn't end there because when Jeff got his own girlfriend with the same crazy rule, all the boys looked at each other with the same wicked thought.

My ex boyfriend, Jake, and I broke up two years ago, but we stayed friends. He was dating this girl, Emma, who seemed nice enough. And when their wedding invitation came in the mail, I honestly felt happy for them. Invitation said cocktail attire, and I had this gorgeous white dress that I bought for my cousin's rehearsal dinner but never got to wear. Here's the thing, though. It wasn't wedding dress white. It was more like cream coloured with tiny silver dots all over it. I paired it with a navy blazer and navy shoes. I thought I looked appropriate and classy. My roommate even said I looked great when I left that morning. I got to the church about 15 minutes before the ceremony started. The moment I walked in, I felt every single person's eyes on me. The ushers kind of froze when they saw me, and this older woman in the front row actually gasped out loud. I started to panic, but figured maybe I was just imagining things. And Jake's mom spotted me. She marched over in her purple mother of the groom dress, grabbed my arm and whispered, what on earth were you thinking? I was so confused. I asked her what she meant and she just stared at my dress like I had shown up naked. That's when it hit me. White dress wedding. Oh, no. I tried to Explain that it was cream, not white, and I had a blazer. But she wasn't having it. She told me I needed to leave immediately or she'd have security escort me out. I was mortified. But then Jake appeared from the back room where he was getting ready. He saw the commotion and came over. His mom started explaining the situation to him, pointing at my dress like it was evidence in a crime scene. Jake looked at me, then at his mom, then back at me. I expected him to be angry or embarrassed. Instead, he started laughing. Not mean laughing, but genuine can't help it laughing. He said, mom

Help me roast this tea. So the teacher, she's so bad at her job, she can't even keep your violent little brat from throwing punches in class. Talking about someone's mom is a low blow.

After seven months of failed attempts, my husband Kyle and I announced that we were finally pregnant. Everyone erupted with cheers except for my sister Jacqueline, who smashed her wine glass against the marble counter. How dare you, she shrieked. You know how long I've been trying for a baby? I deserve to be the first mom. Tried to tell her 19 year olds aren't ready for a baby, but Jacqueline refused to back down. She grabbed her purse and dramatically stormed out, yelling that I, I better abort my baby within one week or else she's getting the police involved. The next morning she showed up at our door with printed pages from abortion clinics, shoving them into Kyle's chest while he was still in his boxers. I made appointments for her at three different places, she announced to our entire cul de sac. She just needs to pick one. When Kyle tore up the papers, she called the whole family, demanding an emergency intervention. That Sunday, 23 relatives crammed into Mom's living room while Jacqueline stood at the fireplace like she was delivering a t. E. D. Talk on why I was destroying her life by having a baby first. She actually had a Powerpoint. Our uncle Jeffrey, who's a lawyer, finally told her there's no legal precedent for forcing someone to abort because you want to be pregnant first. She pointed at me with tears streaming Down her face and said if I didn't terminate by Monday, she'd never speak to any of us again. But we called her bluff and all 23 of us told her, see you, Felicia. She actually left sobbing and we didn't hear from her for a long time. And then seven months into my pregnancy, we were having our baby shower when the door or flew open, it was Jacqueline. She walked in with her hand on a massive belly wearing a shirt that said first grandchild loading. Everyone went silent. Mom dropped her cake knife. Surprise, I'm almost due, she announced, spinning around so everyone could see. I got pregnant right after that horrible meeting where you all betrayed me. I'm 10 weeks away from giving birth. Nobody was impressed. And when I decided to screw with her and mentioned my due date, that was eight weeks, weeks away, her face turned deep red with anger. She grabbed my arm and whispered the dates didn't matter because she'd make sure hers came first, then left before anyone could respond. My mom called me that Tuesday bawling her eyes out. She'd found out from Jacqueline's roommate that Jacqueline had been taking black market labor induction substances she'd bought from some website in Romania, risking her baby's life to deliver before me. Now Jacqueline was in the ICU, but not because of the substances. Turns out Jacqueline had found some girl on Craigslist whose mother used to be a midwife in The Philippines and paid this girl to perform a C section in her living room. The girl kept refusing, saying Jacqueline was only 31 weeks. But my sister threatened to do it herself with kitchen knives if she didn't help. They used box cutters sterilized with vodka. Jacqueline lost so much blood that her neighbor saw it seeping under the, the apartment door. The baby somehow came out alive, but he was purple and barely breathing. They both nearly died in the ambulance. The baby went straight to the NICU on a ventilator, and Jacqueline needed a full hysterectomy. She'd never have another child. When she came to, the first thing she did was call me from her hospital bed. You did this, she gasped through the oxygen mask. My baby is dying because you couldn't wait until me to have a child. The craziest part about all this is now that she was fighting for life, suddenly the fam.

Look, don't buy it right now. I'm trying to get a car and was planning to borrow $48,000 from you. What? You wanna borrow from me, too? And $48,000. I've already paid the deposit on this place. I really don't have extra cash. Are you doing this on purpose? You knew I wanted to buy a car and now you pull this stunt? Brother, don't get upset. I'm not targeting you. Just trying to understand something. From what you're saying, I should lend you $48,000 without question, but you can't lend me $5,000. Is that the logic here? You've known about my car plans forever. How could I possibly have money to lend you? You won't even lend me $5,000. So why should I lend you $48,000? Isn't that a blatant double standard? Because you're my sister's husband. Oh, so just because I'm your sister's husband, I'm obligated to support you unconditionally. I have zero responsibility toward you. I spent a fortune on our wedding when I married your sister. This isn't even a life or death situation. I'm done talking. To you, I'll ask my sister directly. All our money is with me. Going to her won't help. Listen to me. You will give this money to my brother. Give me the money now. Amy, listen to yourself. This isn't healthy. You know what's not healthy? Watching my brother struggle while we sit in our comfortable house with money in the bank. I guess I finally see where your priorities lie.

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother, so one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling washed over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he Was one afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, he said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

It happened during an argument about her curfew. Carmen would let me stay out until midnight, she screamed. She actually understands me. I wish she was my real mom instead of you. I stood there in our kitchen holding the car keys she wanted, feeling something inside me shatter. Carmen, my ex husband's 26 year old wife, yoga instructor who bought my daughter designer clothes and let her drink wine at dinner. The cool mom who didn't enforce bedtimes or check homework. Your curfew is still ten PM, I said quietly slipping the keys into my pocket. I hate you, Natalie shouted. You're ruining my life, dad and Carmen treat me like an adult. She ran to her room and slammed the door. I heard her immediately on the phone. Mom's being a total bitch again. Can you come get me? 40 minutes later, my ex pulled up in his BMW, didn't even come to the door. Natalie dragged her overnight bag downstairs refusing to look at me. I'm staying at dad's this week, maybe permanently. Natalie, you have school. Carmen will drive me. She doesn't have a real job anyway. The job was intentional. I work 50 hours a week as a nurse to keep our apartment, pay for her braces, her phone, her life. Carmen teaches yoga three times a week and post motivational quotes on Instagram. After they left, I sat on Natalie's bed, looked Around her room, the walls still had the stars we painted together when she was 7. The bookshelf I built with my own hands, the quilt my mother made before she passed. But her Instagram was full of photos from her dad's house, Carmen's pristine kitchen, the pool, the shopping sprees, captions like with my favourite person, heart, eyes under, selfies with Carmen. Not one photo of us. I was the one up all night when she had pneumonia at 3. I taught her how to ride a bike, how to read, how to be kind. I worked doubles to pay for her dance classes while her father found himself in Thailand for six months. But Carmen was fun. Carmen was young. Carmen didn't make her eat vegetables or go to bed or study. Natalie stayed at her dad's for 2 weeks, posted constantly about her amazing bonus mom and their girls nights. Carmen taught her how to contour, bought her outfits. I'd said we're too grown up. Let her boyfriend sleep over. Then Carmen got bored. I got the call at 2:00am, Natalie crying, mom, can you come get me? What's wrong? Dad and Carmen went to Vegas. They left me here alone. I, I think someone's trying to break in. I drove 20 minutes in my pajamas, a baseball bat on the passenger seat, found her hiding in the bathroom shaking. The break in turned out to be tree branches scratching the window. But she'd been alone for Two days. I said I was mature enough to handle it, she whispered in the car. Carmen said it was good practice for college. You're 15. I know. Back home, I made her hot chocolate, real cocoa, not the sugar free kind Carmen buys. Natalie sat at.

Marry him anyway, my grandmother told me when I showed her the prenup my fiance's lawyer had drawn up. But first become exactly what they think you are. Everyone else said to run. My friends were horrified. My sister called me pathetic. The prenup basically said if we divorced, I'd get nothing. No alimony, no assets, no claim to anything acquired during marriage. Brian came from old money. His family was convinced I was a gold digger, a nurse marrying a tech CEO for his bank account. The prenup was their idea, protecting their precious son from the calculating poor girl. Sign it, grandma said, then go back to school. With what money? His. She was right. The prenup said nothing about education expenses during marriage, thing about him paying for my life while married. It only protected assets and divorce. So I signed it. His family celebrated. His mother actually said, so glad you understand your place. The day after our wedding, I enrolled in law school. Ryan thought it was cute. My little wife wants to be a lawyer. His friends laughed about how I'd never finish. I finished top of my class, law review, passed the bar, first try. His mother sneered at graduation. Such a waste. You'll be having babies soon. Anyway, I started my MBA next. Ryan paid for everything. We were married, shared finances. The prenup couldn't touch that. His family rolled their eyes at family Dinners while I discussed international business law. Seven years in, I had a law degree, an MBA and had started a consulting firm with the money Ryan gave me for shopping. Built it from nothing to six figures while being the perfect trophy wife at his events. His family still treated me like trash, still made jokes about the prenup protecting them from me. Ryan started believing them, getting cocky, cheating because what was I going to do, leave with nothing? Year 10, I filed for divorce. Ryan laughed. You get nothing. Remember that prenup you signed? Actually, I said I get everything I built. While the prenup protected his pre marriage assets and his income, it said nothing about businesses started during marriage with marital funds. My law degree taught me that. My MBA helped me build it. My consulting firm was worth $2 million. Started with his money? Yes, but legally mine. That's fraud, his mother screamed at mediation. That's marriage. My lawyer, my study partner from law school replied she used marital assets to build her own career. Completely legal. They tried to fight it at $300,000 on lawyers trying to break my business claim. But I documented everything perfectly, every dollar traced, every paper filed correctly. My grandmother's advice that everyone thought was stupid, become exactly what they think you are, then become something they never imagined. I thought I was a gold digger. Fine. I dug through their legal gold mine and found my own treasure. The best part was during the divorce proceedings, Ryan's lawyer tried to argue, I'd planned this all along.

My brother Ryan was marrying this absolute nightmare of a woman named Brianna. Nobody in our family could stand her, but Ryan was completely blind to it. She was controlling from day one. She told my mom she couldn't wear navy to the wedding because that was her color. She demanded our family pay for all the flowers, which cost, like $3,000. When I asked if I could bring my two kids to the wedding, she said absolutely not, because children would ruin her perfect day. But the worst part was when we found out she hadn't even sent an invitation to our grandma Helen. When my mom asked why, Brianna just shrugged and said grandma was boring and would probably fall asleep during the ceremony anyway. I was furious. Grandma Helen was 82 and had basically raised Ryan after our dad died. She taught him how to drive, helped him with homework every night, and even paid for his college textbooks when money was tight. When grandma found out she wasn't invited, she didn't yell or cry like I expected. She just sat quietly in her kitchen chair, nodding slowly. Then she looked up at me with this calm smile and said, well, we'll see about that, won't we? The wedding day came, and I was dreading every minute of it. The venue was actually this gorgeous old mansion that had been in our family for Decades. Grandma had let Ryan use it for free because she wanted his wedding to be special. I was standing there watching Brianna boss around the photographers, when suddenly I heard gasps from the guests. There was Grandma Helen walking up the main entrance in the most stunning gold gown I'd ever seen. She looks like royalty. She was carrying this leather folder under her arm and had the biggest smile on her face. Brianna spotted her immediately and marched over, her face turning bright red. What are you doing here? You weren't invited! Brianna screamed loud enough for everyone to hear. The entire wedding party stopped what they were doing to watch. Grandma didn't even

Ever since I got to Mrs. Coleman's sixth grade class, she had this sick habit of making fun of the way I talked. See, I have this stutter that comes and goes, especially when I'm nervous or put on the spot. And this woman seemed to get off on calling me out every single time. At first, I thought maybe I was being dramatic, like, maybe she didn't mean it that way. But then it got worse. Way worse. Every time I'd raise my hand to answer something, she'd cut me off. The second I started struggling with a word. Oh, for crying out loud, just spit it out already, she'd say, rolling her eyes like I was the biggest inconvenience in the world. The whole class would get this uncomfortable silence, you know, like they wanted to say something but were too scared she'd turn on them next. Honestly, I don't blame them. Mrs. Coleman was the type of teacher who'd write you up for breathing too loud if she was having a bad day. After a few weeks of this garbage, I completely stopped raising my hand, stopped participating in anything. My grades started tanking because I was too terrified to speak up. Even when I knew the answers. I just sit there in the back row, trying to be invisible. My mom started noticing I was acting weird at home. She kept asking what was wrong, but I didn't want to be a snitch, you know? Plus, part of me thought maybe she wouldn't believe me or would think I was exaggerating. One night, when I was doing homework at the kitchen table. She sat down across from me and said, Alex, you used to love reading out loud to me. What's going on at school? I tried to brush it off, but she kept pushing, gently. Finally, I just broke down and told her everything. I told her how Mrs. Coleman would imitate my voice when I stuttered.

My neighbor, Mrs. Daniels, called 9 1 1 like it was her personal hotline. Monday she reported my kids for trespassing because their ball went in her yard. Wednesday she called the cops because my autistic son was making noise in our own backyard. Friday she called saying the kids were in danger because they were playing tag. The 9 1 1 operator probably recognized her voice better than her own family did. Things got worse as spring turned into summer and her calls went from annoying to actually dangerous. First, she called CPS and said we left our kids alone outside. I was sitting right there on the porch with a book when the social worker showed up. They close the case right away, but people had already started talking about us. Two weeks later, during my daughter's birthday party, she called the fire department about a gas leak. Five fire trucks showed up with their sirens going and scared all 12 kids at the party. The firefighters didn't find anything, but she went on Facebook saying we were probably making drugs. The worst thing happened in July when my autistic son had a meltdown in our yard. She called 9 1 1 and said a child was being beaten. Showed up ready for a domestic violence call and found me hugging my upset kid. Officer Martinez said something about her false reports, but Nothing happened to her. She started calling during my work zoom meetings on purpose. Other neighbors told me she kept notebooks full of made up complaints with dates and everything. She actually brag to people about making families like ours want to move away. Everything went crazy on a Tuesday in August when I got a letter from her lawyer wanting $15,000. She said we cause her emotional distress even though she was the one who called 9 1 1 53 times. I tried to talk to her like a normal person, but she said she'd add harassment to the lawsuit. That same day, my autistic son had his first friend from therapy come over to play. While the two kids were quietly playing with Legos, she called about suspicious people in my yard. Police cars surrounded my house, and both seven year olds were terrified.

Then boom, it hits 2:00am and a wave of sadness comes. I'll start crying, acting all depressed and watching videos that aren't even sad. Then start reposting some of them.

After 12 hours of labor, the nurse handed me my son for the first time, and my brain completely rejected what my eyes were showing me. Sarah was destroyed from 12 hours of labor, her blonde hair plastered with sweat as she reached for our baby with shaking arms. But I stood paralyzed. The child in my white hands had deep brown skin and tightly coiled black hair that looked like someone had played the cruelest possible prank on us. Isn't he beautiful, Sarah whispered. And I forced myself to nod, even though my throat felt like it was closing. She must have seen something in my face because her smile faltered and she said, I know he doesn't look like what we expected, but remember what I told you about my great, great grandfather? I did remember vaguely some story about distant relatives with darker features, but this baby looked completely black. And my mind was racing with possibilities I didn't want to consider. The next few hours were a blur of nurses checking vitals and Sarah's family bursting through the door. They raced here for the emergency delivery while my family searched desperately for flights from Colorado. Her mother cradled our son like precious gold, and her sister kept touching his tiny fingers and saying he had Sarah's exact chin. Their pure joy made my doubts feel poisonous. Sarah watched me watching them and finally reached for my hand. Are you okay with this, she whispered. And her voice broke something open in me. I kissed her forehead and promised I'd be the best father this baby could have. This wasn't what we'd expected, but we were still a team. Nothing would change that. But the poison started seeping in. The moment I left the hospital to grab clothes from home, my phone exploded with messages from my mother, who'd seen the photos Sarah posted. That is not your child, her text said in all caps, followed by, I told you she wasn't good enough for our family. My best friend Jake called while I was driving and said, dude, I'm sorry, but there's no way. You need to get tested ASAP before you sign anything. Even my brother, who'd always loved Sarah, texted, man, the math isn't mathing here. By the time I got back to the hospital, my head was spinning with doubt. Sarah was nursing the baby and singing softly, looking like the perfect mother. But all I could think about was how she'd been working late so many nights during her pregnancy and how her phone was always face down on the counter. My mother called again while Sarah was sleeping and spent 20 minutes listing every time she'd caught Sarah in a lie, which were really just miscommunications, but suddenly seemed sinister. She played you for a fool, my mother said, and now she's trying to pass off another man's baby as yours. The Next morning, I couldn't even look at the baby without feeling sick. Sarah noticed immediately and asked what was wrong. But I just shrugged and said I was tired. She tried again, reminding me about her cousin Marcus, who had similar features, even pulling up photos on her phone. But my mother's voice kept echoing in my head, especially after her text that morning saying there were no flights left and she'd come when things were sorted out. When the discharge papers came, I told Sarah I needed air and walked out of the hospital. I sat in my car for an hour reading text after text from friends and family, all saying the same thing, that I was being scammed, that no genealogy could explain this, that I needed to protect myself. I didn't go back inside. Instead, I texted Sarah that I needed a paternity test before we were done, then turned off my phone and drove to my buddy's house to crash on his couch. My brother caught the first flight out when I finally called him, and we spent days feeding each other's doubts while I ignored Sarah's desperate attempts to reach me. She's probably scrambling to figure out her story, my brother said when we grabbed beers at some dive bar near. Thank god you didn't sign the birth certificate, my mother added during one of her hourly calls, her voice full of relief, like I dodged a bullet instead of abandoned my family when I finally agreed to meet for the test. I made.

I lost my son to the streets when he was 14. That was it. Deshawn started running with the nigeltron, stealing, carrying guns, disappearing for weeks at a time. His dad was in prison, so it was just me working double shifts at the hospital while watching my baby throw his life away piece by piece. But I fought like hell to get him back. I never stopped praying he'd come home alive. That year, everything changed completely. Deshawn got arrested on a weapons charge, facing ten years as an adult. But the feds made him an offer. Cooperate with their investigation, testify against his crew, and he'd get probation plus witness Protection. They promised me he'd be safe. We've done this hundreds of times, Mrs. Serena. Your son will be completely protected. This is his ticket out of this life forever. Deshawn took the deal without hesitation. When he was freed eight months later, something was different in his eyes. He looked at me and said, Mama, I'm done with this life. I wanna make you proud for once. The prosecutors relocated us across town. New apartment, new phone numbers, new identities. They said the gang thought he was still locked up. We were completely invisible. I went overboard helping him rebuild his entire future. Got him enrolled in GED classes, drove him to community college. Every morning at 7:00am sharp, he studied like his life depended on it. Which It literally did. Applied to Howard University for business administration. Talked constantly about opening an auto shop, helping kids like himself escape the streets. When the Howard acceptance letter came in March, full scholarship, he screamed so loud, the neighbors complained. First person in our family to go to university. He was blowing with pure joy and pride. His community college graduation was May 20th. Then Howard in the fall. I took my first vacation day in three years. Bought a new dress from the department store, got my hair done professionally. I wanted to look perfect when they called his name. Sean had his speech memorized. Practiced it every morning in the bathroom mirror. The night before graduation, Desean was trying on his cap and gown for the hundredth time, practicing his walk across an imaginary stage. I was making his favorite dinner, my grandmother's fried chicken recipe. We stayed up late talking about Howard. He hugged me tight and said, and tomorrow is our day, Mama. We made it. That morning, Deshawn woke me up at 6:00am, grinning ear to ear. Graduation day, he yelled. We had breakfast together. He put on his suit, and I took pictures of him in his cap and gown. He left early to get to the venue and practice his speech one more time. I was driving to the ceremony alone, singing along to the radio, when my phone rang. It was the hospital Miss

My 16 year old Sophie had been begging for AirPods Pro all summer, the new 300 dollar model. She'd researched every feature, watched countless unboxing videos, even created a detailed comparison chart showing why the Pro version was essential for her aesthetic. Her birthday arrived and I surprised her with the exact model. I was so proud finding them in stock when they'd been sold out everywhere. Her face dropped the second she opened the box. Um, these are the regular AirPods Pro. She held them like they were defective. I specifically said I need the AirPods Pro Max. Everyone at school has the Max version now. These make me look poor. The Max version. This kid wanted the $600 over ear headphones that cost more than my car payment. Her music career consisted of making 15 second TikTok dance videos to trending songs. The Pro version has the same sound quality I explained trying to salvage the moment. These are what actual musicians use for professional work. Mom, nobody cares about sound quality. It's about the look. These tiny earbuds are so basic. The max ones are a statement piece. Was already putting them back in the box. Can you just return these and get the right ones? It's only like 300 bucks more. Only 300 bucks more. Like I was made of money that's stung deep. I'd specifically researched which model music professionals recommended. I'd read reviews, compared features. Even asked my friend who works in audio production. I'll think about it, I said quietly, taking the box from her. She was already back on her phone. Thanks, mom. You're the best. Make sure you get the space grey ones, not silver. Silver looks cheap on camera. I just nodded and walked away. Next day, I'm at Apple store standing in the return line, still feeling terrible about the whole situation. The line was moving slowly and I could hear the customer service conversation happening ahead of me. I'm sorry, ma'am, your card was declined again. Do you want to try a different payment method? I looked up from my phone. A woman about my age wearing scrubs with Maria embroidered on them was standing there with her teenage son. He couldn't have been older than 15, wearing a faded band T-shirt and holding her hand supportively. Um, let me try this one, Maria said, pulling out a different card. Her hands were shaking slightly. Sorry, Miguel. I thought I had enough after paying rent. This one declined too, the employee said gently. The boy immediately stepped forward. It's okay, mom. I don't really need new earbuds for school. My old ones still work fine for online classes. Maria's shoulders sagged like someone had just crushed her dreams. Miho, you've been using those broken earbuds for two years. The left one doesn't even work anymore. And you need them for your virtual music lessons. Maybe next month I'll have Better tips from work, she said, her voice cracking. Your music teacher said you have real talent. You deserve proper equipment. Mom, sharing one earbud with my study group is fine. Besides, my music sounds better when we listen to.

My best friend Mike called me at 3:00am last Tuesday, voice shaking. I need to tell you something, and I need you to listen without hanging up. We've been friends since middle school, so I knew something was seriously wrong. Remember that guy Derek, who kept harassing my sister at work? The one who followed her home and kept showing up at her apartment? I remembered Derek was this creepy older guy who wouldn't take no for an answer. Mike's sister Emma, had filed multiple complaints, but nothing stuck. Well, he's not going to bother anyone anymore, Mike said quietly. My blood went cold. What do you mean, he's not going to bother anyone? There was this long pause where I could hear Mike breathing heavily through the phone. I was driving home from Emma's place last night around midnight. She'd been crying because Derek showed up at her work again, this time with flowers and a note saying he knew where she lived. I was so angry I could barely see straight, Mike continued. That's when I saw Derek's car parked outside her apartment complex. He was just sitting there in the dark, watching her windows. I pulled over and walked up to his car. When he saw me, he started laughing and said Emma would come around eventually. I snapped. I dragged him out of the car, and we started fighting in the parking lot. But then he Hit his head on the concrete when he fell. There was so much blood and he wasn't moving. I checked for a pulse, but there was nothing. My hands were shaking as I held the phone. Mike, please tell me you called 9 1 1. Another long silence. I panicked. I put his body in his trunk and drove his car to the old quarry outside town. You know, the one where we used to go swimming as kids. The car is at the bottom of the lake now with Derek inside. I hiked back to my car and drove home like nothing happened. I felt sick to my stomach. This was my best friend. The guy who helped me through my parents divorce, who was the best man at my wedding. Mike, we need to call the police right now. This was self defense, or at least manslaughter. If you explain what happened. No, he interrupted. They'll never believe me. A guy with Derek's background doesn't just disappear without someone looking into it. But if they find the car, I'm going to prison for murder. The next few days were torture. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn't look at my wife without feeling like I was keeping this horrible secret. Mike acted completely normal, even asking if I wanted to grab drinks that weekend. But something felt wrong about his story. Derek was a big guy, probably 200 pounds. Mike was maybe 150, soaking wet. How did he drag A body that size and get it into a trunk by himself? And why would Derek be parked outside Emma's apartment when she moved to a new place across town two weeks ago? I started doing some digging. I called Emma and casually asked how she was doing with the Derek situation. Oh, that's been resolved for weeks, she said. My new boyfriend Jake had a talk with him, and Derek hasn't bothered me since. When did this happen? I asked about three weeks ago. Jake used to play college football, and I think Derek got the message pretty clearly three weeks ago. But Mike said this happened last Tuesday. Then I remembered something else. Mike had been acting strange for months, not just the past week. Paranoid, jumpy, asking weird questions about loyalty and friendship. He'd been having money problems, too. Something about gambling debts. I decided to drive out to the quarry myself. If there really was a car down there, I needed to see it with my own eyes. When I got to the spot where we used to swim, the water was crystal clear. You could

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning, after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day, I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy, and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was. One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

I moved in with my girlfriend Tessa after dating for 8 months. Everything seemed perfect. She was funny, smart and had this golden retriever named Milo who she absolutely adored. Only problem was Milo seemed to hate my guts from day one. This dog would bark at me non stop whenever I walked in the room. He'd pee on my clothes if I left them on the floor. One time he even snapped at me when I tried to kiss Tessa goodnight. But every time I brought it up, Tessa would just laugh it off. He's just protective of me, she'd say with this sweet smile. Dogs can be jealous when their owner gets a boyfriend. He'll warm up to you eventually. I really wanted to make it work. I took Milo on long walks every morning before work. I bought him expensive treats and toys. I even let him sleep in our bed even though he growled at me all night. But nothing worked. If anything, he seemed to get worse. The weird part was I started noticing Milo only acted aggressive when Tessa wasn't around. When she was home, he'd just ignore me or give me these creepy stares. But the second she left for work or went to the store, this dog turned into a complete psycho. One afternoon while I was making lunch, Milo straight up lunged at me and bit my ankle hard. Blood was Dripping down into my sock. When Tessa got home an hour later, I showed her the bite marks and told her what happened. He looked at the wound then at me and said, you must have done something to provoke him. Milo doesn't just attack people for no reason. I couldn't believe it. Tessa, look at my leg. Your dog bit me and drew blood. Maybe you stepped on his tail or something. She said shrugging. Dogs don't lie, Jordan. People do that. Stung. But I didn't want to be the guy who made his girlfriend choose between him and her pet. Instead, I went online and bought a cheap pet camera. I set it up in the hallway where Milo spent most of his time when Tessa was gone. The first day of footage was normal. Milo just slept on his bed and ignored me. But on the second day, I caught something that made my blood run cold. Right before Tessa left for work, she knelt down next to Milo and whispered something in his ear. I couldn't make out the words, but after she left, Milo immediately got up and started barking at me aggressively. I rewind the footage and turned up the volume. Clear as day, I heard Tessa say.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night. Just stood in the doorway, clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development. Their church pastor who believed homosexuality was a choice. And for three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires. Just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We Were constantly monitored. No privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One. One night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

I didn't know guys will just stand in the shower for 10 minutes doing nothing, no water running, just standing there like they're waiting for a download to finish. The first time I walked in on it, I thought something was wrong. He looked at me all calm and said, I'm just mentally preparing. I've never looked at showers the same way. 2. I found out men treat fridges like treasure hunts. He'll open it five times in a row, stare like something new is going to spawn, sigh dramatically, and then eat plain cheese straight from the block. I once asked why he keeps checking. He said in case a snack magically appears. Three, I didn't know guys hum to themselves during the most random tasks. My boyfriend will be cleaning the sink humming what sounds like boss battle music, then suddenly switched to singing about how this sponge is my sword. I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said, but it still smells like me so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said, because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6, 10. They make sound effects for everything, opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7, they'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8, they'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes. And apparently that's normal to them. 9, they'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car, groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10, they can sit in total silence for an hour staring at the wall. And when you ask what they're thinking about, they say nothing. And somehow they really mean nothing.

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother, so one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his work bench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice. And I apologized over and over. I, I promised I would talk to him, but deep down, I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, I said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

I used to fake sick at least once a month. Nothing dramatic, just your classic ugh, my stomach hurts routine. I'd shuffle into the kitchen, wrap myself in a blanket, throw in a little cough, and wait for my mom to sigh and say, fine, but no video games. She always fell for it. Or maybe she just didn't care enough to argue. This time felt no different. It was a Thursday. I had a math test I wasn't ready for, and zero energy to sit through Mr. Danner's forty five minute rant about fractions, so I pulled out the old stomachache move. My mom was already halfway out the door for work, so she just nodded and left. I grabbed a bowl of cereal, flopped on to the couch, and turned on some cartoons, already feeling like I'd won. Dad works nights, so he usually sleeps through most of the day and the house stays quiet, but around 10:00 I heard his door open. I muted the TV and listened. He walked past the living room without noticing me, phone in hand, and stepped out into the garage. Didn't think much of it at first, figured maybe he was calling in sick or trying to get a refund for something. But then I heard his voice through the wall. And it wasn't his normal voice. It was quiet, tired, flat. I can't do this anymore, he said. I paused. I Tried. I really tried. But I feel like I don't even know my family anymore. I come home and everything's just cold. I tiptoed down the hall, heart suddenly racing. The garage door was cracked open, just like always, and I crouched beside it. I know this isn't what we wanted, but it's where we are now, he said. Every day I feel like I'm just pretend ending. Pretending to be fine. Pretending to be a good husband, a good dad. My stomach twisted. This time for real. I mean, look at him, he said. He doesn't even like me. He doesn't talk to me unless he wants something. And when he does, it's just one word. Answers. I don't even know who he is anymore. My throat went dry. I look at him and all I can think is, what happened? What did I do wrong? When did he start looking at me like I was a stranger? There was silence then. I know it's awful, but sometimes I wonder if I'd be happier alone. Just starting over. Somewhere quiet. Somewhere nobody knows me. My chest felt like it caved in. I haven't said anything to her yet, he continued. I don't even know if I will. But I can't keep going like this. I'm exhausted. I backed away from the door before I could hear more. I stumbled into the bathroom and locked the door behind me. Sat on the edge of the and stared at the floor. He didn't know I was home. He didn't know I was listening. And he definitely didn't know I had just realized something I could never unhear. My dad didn't just feel lost. He felt lost because of me. I stayed in the bathroom for over an hour, just trying to breathe. When I finally came out, he was back in his room. I crept into mine, got under the covers, and didn't move for the rest the day. Later that night, he knocked on my door. How's your stomach? He asked. Fine. I mumbled. Need anything? No. He stood there for a second longer, then said, okay, let me know. I said nothing.

Three months of casual dating is nothing compared to an actual marriage. Okay, I wasn't. Oh my goodness. Wait, listen, I wasn't. Okay. Does he take off his wedding ring every time you see him? Yeah, he girl, he has never been wearing a wedding ring ever. Like never, ever. And I wasn't trying to be disrespectful of your marriage. I had no idea that he was married. Like, so that's what I'm saying. So obviously it's not been casual dating in my opinion and in my eyes, we have been building something together. So forgive me for sleeping with your husband, but I had no idea that he was your husband. Do you feel me? Oh, man. Um, okay, well, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to forgive you, but obviously, like you said, I guess she didn't tell you. This is not necessarily your fault. I'm sure I hope that you wouldn't go Out of your way to sleep with a married man. But if you said that you don't know that he's married, I guess I don't really have any choice to believe you. So. Oh my God, I'm going to, I mean, I honestly wouldn't, I wouldn't go out of my way to sleep with a married man. But like, here's the, the fact of the matter is that I did, you know, and I do have feelings for Desmond. So I don't really know, like, I don't really know what to say right now. I'm feeling very overwhelmed. And I'm sorry, I don't, this is really totally, completely awkward and weird. But like, I don't know what's going on either. I have no idea.

Last month I bought my first home after 13 years of grinding. My reward, a court summons from my own parents. The reason? That house should have been sages. I thought they were joking. They weren't. See, I've been living off ramen and working 60 hour weeks since college while my sister Sage got a full ride through life, art school, fancy apartment, everything handed to her. When she graduated with her 1 hundred eighty k art history degree, my parents promised her they'd help buy a house. Problem is, they're broke. Turns out funding Sage's lifestyle for 26 years drained their savings. when I finally scraped together enough for a down payment on a modest three bedroom, suddenly I became the villain. Their lawyer wanted me to transfer the house to my sister, pay off her mortgage, 50 k for emotional damages and write an apology for breaking up the family. I laughed so hard I snorted and hung up. The harassment started immediately. Mom posted on Facebook, some children forget where they came from. His sister has student loans and no stable housing. A good son would help his family. Disappointed. Now your family values, my aunt commented, shameful behavior. Your sister needs that house more than you need your selfishness. I got uninvited from Thanksgiving. The family group chat, cousins I hadn't talked to in years suddenly had opinions about my greed. My uncle called me Selfish for not stepping up when family needed help. Extended family members I barely knew were messaging me, telling me I was destroying the family and that I should do the right thing. Sage started posting Instagram stories about being betrayed by blood and how money changes people. He filmed herself crying outside my new house, talking about how she just wanted a place to call home. My parents escalated. Dad started parking outside my workplace, following me to the grocery store. Mom would show up at my gym, making scenes about how I was breaking her heart. They actually hired a private investigator to go through my finances trying to prove I somehow stole money or got help from someone. When that turned up nothing, they claimed I must have gotten an illegal loan. Court day arrives. My parents show up with Sage and my aunt, all wearing matching t shirts that said family comes first in giant letters. They brought a photographer to document their fight for justice. The drama started immediately. Sage rushed at me crying, I forgive you for pushing things this far. We can still fix this. I stepped back. She stumbled forward, arms grasping at air, putting on a perform for the courtroom. From the back row, my aunt muttered loud enough for everyone to hear, look at him turning his back on his own sister in her time of need. The judge banged his gavel for silence. Their lawyer clearly embarrassed to be There began presenting evidence, childhood Happy Meal receipts from 2003, a spreadsheet itemizing every birthday gift they'd ever bought me, including a 3 99 toy car from 1998, text messages where I said love you as proof of family obligation. They brought photo albums from when I was a baby, presenting them.

I was at my cousin Rachel's wedding reception when shit went completely sideways. The D J. Had just announced the father daughter dance. Everyone had their phones out ready to record, when this woman at table 12 starts talking loudly on her phone, not whispering, full volume, like she was alone in her living room. Yeah, I'm at some wedding. She. He's saying the decorations look like interest threw up. I'm only here because Mark works with the groom. My aunt Patricia, who'd spent eight months planning every detail and handmade 200 pascals a D per F lowers for the centerpieces, walks over with this forced smile. Real polite. She leans down and asks the woman to take the call outside. Woman, mid forties, wearing what looked like a sequin nightmare, pulls the phone away, looks Patricia dead in the eye, and goes, honey, I've been to nicer weddings at Applebee's. The music stops. Everyone's staring. Patricia's eye twitches. The woman continues into her phone. I'm serious, Sharon. These centerpieces look like dollar store clearance. And don't get me started on the bridesmaid dresses. That's when I noticed movement from table two. My 7 8 year old Grandma Dorothy was slowly standing up from her wheelchair. This woman, who complained for 20 minutes about her hip during the ceremony, was now moving with purpose. He adjusts her hearing aid, grabs her walker, and starts crossing the dance floor. The crowd parts like the Red Sea. Everyone knows Grandma Dorothy. She raised six kids during the depression and once made a door to door salesman cry just by looking at him. She taps the woman on the shoulder. The woman turns, phone and still pressed to her ear, looking annoyed. Grandma clears her throat and in her sweetest church voice says, sweetheart, I need to tell you something. Lady, I'm on the phone. Oh, I can see that. Grandma says still sugar sweet. I just wanted to let you know that I may be half blind, but even I can see you're built like a melted candle wearing a Party City wig. The woman's jaw drops. Someone gasps, my uncle starts recording. You're sitting here insulting my granddaughter's wedding while looking like you got dressed in the dark at Ross Dress for less! Those sequins aren't fooling anyone. We can all see your spanks are screaming for mercy. The woman finally hangs up, face going purple. How dare you! Grandma interrupts. Adults are talking. Well, one adult and whatever yard sale mannequin you are. Half the reception is now filming. The woman stands up, trying to tower over my five foot grandma. Listen here, you old bat! Old bat? Grandma chuckles. Honey, I've got any holes older than your marriage. Wait! She glances at the woman's bare ring finger. My mistake. Can't imagine why you're single. Someone at table 6 applauds. The woman grabs her knockoff purse. This is assault! I'll sue! For what? Telling the truth, I suppose if I looked like a clearance rack exploded on a scarecrow, I'd be sensitive, too.

When I was 17, my mom forced me to start babysitting, but I had no idea who I was doing it for. When I met this woman, I couldn't believe how overprotective she was. She had cameras in every room of the house and asked me to call her every half hour just to make sure her daughter was okay. She told me I wasn't allowed to do anything except watch her. And when she finally left, I basically just sat there for three hours doing nothing until she came home. She came back and basically ran into the room to make sure the girl was okay and I assured her everything was fine. I had long hair at the time and had put it up at this point. And should probably now mention I have severe hearing loss. I have to wear hearing aids, which can usually be easily mistaken for headphones. Then as I was standing up to say bye to the girl, her mom noticed them in my ears. She thought I was wearing headphones the whole time and wasn't paying attention to the little girl. This made her furious and a second later, I felt her grab my head. All I remember was feeling the worst pain I've ever felt in my ear. I turned around to see her holding my hearing aid and realized what she did. She thought I was listening to music. She ripped my hearing aid. Out of my ear, thinking it was a headphone. And since they connect directly to my eardrum, she completely ripped that out, too. The pain was so intense I passed out and woke up in the hospital to my mom crying. She was livid. And even though they begged us not to, we sued her. I will never hear out of my ear again, but I'll never have to work again either.

I will take the house, kids, and everything. I stayed calm. Then I sent her an envelope. Now her lawyer is frantically calling mine. After 15 years of marriage, Megan stood in our kitchen and delivered her nuclear bomb. I'm not happy, Jeremy. Haven't been for years. And, yes, there's someone else. Been going on for a while. I just nodded, keeping my face neutral. Inside, my chest was caving in. Then came her smirk, pure arrogance that revealed who she really was. You'll never prove it. Keith is very careful. And even if you did, good luck. She puffed out her chest like she'd rehearse this. I'm taking the house. The kids will stay with me, obviously. And you'll be paying for all of it. You'll have nothing. Voice dripping contempt you think I haven't spoken to a lawyer? I know my rights. You're too soft, Jeremy. Always have been. I looked at her, really looked at the woman I'd loved, mother of Alice and Harold, and felt only. I see clarity. Okay, Megan, I said simply. Okay. Her smirk faltered. She'd expected yelling, tears. Instead, she got calm acceptance. For two weeks, she acted like she'd already won, telling our kids, you'll be with mommy. Mostly while serving me divorce papers demanding full custody, house, my car, and crushing alimony. Her shark lawyer clearly thought this would be easy prey. Megan believed she held all the cards. She was wrong. What she didn't know was that I'd hired a private investigator the moment she admitted the affair. While she felt smug and invincible, I was methodically building a case that would destroy every Assumption she'd made. The PI documented everything. Hotel receipts, their dates, intimate photos of Megan and key. All paid for with her credit card, funded by salary earned during our marriage, making it marital property she was squandering. But the evidence got even better. Megan had used her company email for the affair, detailing how she'd take Jeremy to the cleaners, how he was too stupid to see it coming, and how she'd make sure the kids understood the divorce was his fault. The best part came from my friend Andrea. During lunch, after two glasses of wine, Megan got loose lipped about her exit strategy. How she'd cry for the judge, paint me as emotionally distant, and how Keith thought her shark behavior was hot. Andrea recorded the whole conversation. I compiled everything into one devastating envelope. Detailed PI reports with dates, times, and locations. Copies of her work emails.

My older sister Emma has cerebral palsy, and my parents have spent my entire life making me pay for being the normal one. Growing up, every family dinner was about Emma's achievement. She got a B+ despite her challenge, while you only got an A. Every birthday, half my presents went to Emma so she wouldn't feel left out. When I made varsity soccer, her dad said, just remember, Emma will never get to run like that. I became the family ATM at 14. My summer job money went to Emma's therapy. My babysitting cash funded her special equipment. When other kids bought video games, I was buying Emma's medications. My friends got cars for their 16 birthdays. I got a lecture about privilege and responsibility. The worst part? Everyone praised my parents for raising such a selfless son. Teachers would gush about how mature I was. Neighbors called me an inspiration. Church members held us up as the perfect Christian family. I smiled and nodded while dying inside, wondering what I'd done wrong to deserve this life. My guidance counselor pulled me aside junior year. Jake, your grades are incredible. Have you thought about applying to top universities? I laughed bitterly. With what money? She looked confused, so I explained that every penny I'd ever earned went to Emma's care. When I got accepted to Stanford with a partial scholarship, mom sat me down with tears in Her eyes. We're so proud of you, she said. But we can't afford the rest. Emma needs a new wheelchair, and her therapy costs just went up again. My college fund, 18 years of birthday money, graduation gifts, everything had vanished into Emma's medical expenses without anyone asking me. I watched my dreams crumble while my parents acted like they were making a noble sacrifice. I was 22, working two dead end jobs to afford community college, living in my childhood bedroom decorated with part disappointment trophies I'd won before I Learned winning meant nothing in our house. Emma called me, sobbing one night. I need to tell you something, she whispered. Can we meet tomorrow? We sat in a coffee shop where she pulled out her phone with shaking hands. I recorded mom and dad last night. You need to hear this. The audio destroyed me. Mom's voice we've been too hard on Jake. Using Emma as an excuse to control his life isn't fair to either of them, dad replied. He's strong, though. He'll figure it out. Besides, Emma actually told me she feels guilty about the college money. She never asked for any of this attention, but we made it seem like she needed everything. Mom continued, when really, we just couldn't say no to her requests and yes to his dreams. We turned him into her caretaker instead of her brother. The worst part is how proud everyone thinks we are. Dad sighed. When really, we Just took the easy path. It's easier to sacrifice Jake's future than fight insurance companies. My sister looked at me with tears streaming down her face. Jake, I never asked them to take your college fund. I begged them not to. When I found out last year, they said you'd understand because you're the responsible one who always

Look, I never thought I'd be the type of person to have a screaming match in a hospital parking lot, but here we are. My husband Jake and I have been together for six years, married for four, and this was our first real fight that made me question everything. 33 weeks pregnant right now, and at 20 weeks, my doctor told me I have something called placenta previa. Basically, my placenta is blocking the opening where the baby needs to come out. They said it might move as the baby grows, but mine never did. So I'm scheduled for a C section in three weeks. The whole thing started getting real at 30 weeks, when my doctor put me on strict restrictions. No running, no lifting anything over 10 pounds, no standing for more than three hours, and absolutely no sex or anything going near that area. She was super clear. Any bleeding could trigger preterm labour and put both me and the baby at risk. Jake has been losing his mind over the no sex rule every single day. He'd bring it up every morning while I'm trying to eat my cereal without throwing up. He's making comments. When I'm trying to watch TV after work with my feet up because they're swollen like balloons, he's rubbing my shoulders, but really, he's just working up to asking again. I kept explaining the doctor's Orders. But he'd roll his eyes and say stuff like, you're not made of glass or, doctors are so paranoid these days. I'm exhausted all the time. My back hurts, I can barely see my feet, and honestly, sex is the last thing on my mind. Anyway, three days ago, he came into our bedroom while I was folding tiny baby clothes and started this whole speech about how doctors exaggerate things for money and push unnecessary C sections. He said my doctor was being dramatic and that one time wouldn't hurt anything. I tried to explain again about the bleeding risk, but he kept pushing. I was tired of fighting about about it every single day. Part of me just wanted him to stop asking. And I guess I convinced myself that maybe he was right and the doctor was being overly cautious. So we had sex. About two hours later. I went to the bathroom, and there was so much blood, I thought I was dying. I'm talking bright red blood just pouring out of me. I started shaking and crying, thinking I was about to lose our baby at 33 weeks. I called my doctor's emergency line while Jake was in the living room watching some stupid action movie. She told me to come to the hospital immediately. The whole 20 minute drive, there I was, sobbing, imagining holding a tiny premature baby who might not make it. Jake kept trying to hold my hand and saying, Probably nothing. But I could see he was scared, too. His face was completely white, and he kept gripping the steering wheel. When we got to the hospital, they hooked me up to monitors right away. The baby's heartbeat was strong, and after what felt like hours, the doctor said I wasn't in labor. The bleeding had stopped, and everything looked okay. But it was definitely caused by the sex. That's when my doctor asked Jake to step outside. She started.

Yeah, I was all in on it, you know? And then we went over to. We went bowling over at Cosmic Balls, you know, and they got the neon lights and the loud music, you know, we were having, like, a good time. Balls are. That is a good. And that's where you can, like, order some mozzarella sticks for yourself on the side and eat them over, like, the bathroom where she can't see you. Tell him, hey, leave them over on the stall. Too on the stall. But the thing is, the bowling, it ends like at 11:00. And I was like, I thought the date went well. And I was thinking, we just call it a night, okay.

That's like the perfect place to hit a ball. It's a sweet spot. Alright, it's a layup. Are you a little bit older than Kelly? No. Well, I think I have a couple years on her, but not that much.

Yeah, yeah, okay. But you know, she needed to get coffee first. So we just went to one of those gas stations and got some coffee and. Oh, gas station coffee. You couldn't wait to Starbucks? That's open 24 hours. She suffered from heartburn the rest of the evening. It's not easy to get a coffee. I guess at 11:30 it is. If you know the Prices, yeah. Yeah, but not all, like, Starbucks or whatever. I mean, maybe that's not even a thing. Like, was it. Was she fine with that? It's not like we're in Miami in the 80s.

And I'm calling you because you recently went out on a date with one of our listeners and they were hoping that we could get a hold of you. Why is a radio show calling me about a date? Well, we do a segment on our show called The 2nd Date Update. So you recently went out on a date with a girl named Jenna. Yeah. Okay. And so Jenna emailed us because you haven't been answering any of her phone calls and she thought you guys had a great time, but she's wondering if she did something wrong or if there was a specific reason that you're not calling her back. No, there's nothing specific. Just, you know, not digging to going through with things that you know There's no point to so you feel like there's no point in continuing to try to date Jenna? I mean, I just know that it's not gonna work let me ask you this was it because she dressed too conservatively right? Please. I know that's annoying. No, that had nothing to do with it. Okay. Well, she was she was actually concerned that that might be the issue. No, that's that's that's not the reason why well, if that's not the reason why can you kind of give us a little bit of information so that at least I can tell her hey, don't worry about the way that you dress it wasn't that yeah, you can tell her that that's fine but I mean, as far as like a more specific thing it's just kind of like one of those things where it's not gonna work and really to be honest, she's cute and everything but I'm looking for a different breed of girl a different breed. What does that even mean? We're not breed like we don't come like thoroughbred or no, there are some thoroughbreds out there and there are some definite runs believe me. I know I know what you're talking about Scott. Yeah, I mean, there are some breeds of all kinds of humans. Thank you. But what are you looking for then? You know, basically I'm a guy who works a lot pretty successful at what I do and you know is she not Pretty enough? No, she's fine. She's very cute. I'm not saying that the bottom line is that like, I don't know how to say this, but she's too smart. What you said too? Did you just say too smart? Yeah, too smart. Yeah, that's right. She is too smart. I'm not looking for, um, a smart girl. What you want for, um, a smart girl what you want that might be the, that might be the best way to be turned down for a date ever is for somebody to tell you that you're too smart. That's like a compliment, but then also a let down at the same time. Why? What? What do you mean you, you only date dumb girls? Well, I mean, I wouldn't say that. Um, I just want someone who is not as smart and someone who's not as ambitious as Jenna is. Why would you not? I, I, I feel like I look for the opposite and I've never had the opposite. So I've had the other thing and trust me, it's not all that's cracked up to be, but I feel like I want the opposite and and why would you want to be with someone who's not ambitious and not smart? Well, like I said, I'm pretty successful and, um, I need someone who's just gonna focus on me and not their own career or their own motivation. Oh my God. Oh, so cool. So you just want someone to be home And look pretty for you and make you some dinner every once in a while. You know, I'm a good looking guy. I do really well. Basically, I just been looking for some arm candy. And there's nothing wrong with that. Well, there is because you're treating your woman as a trophy no matter who she is. So there's lots of things wrong with that. There is a ton of benefits, okay. She gets to go on a lot of great vacation, a lot of business trip.

I don't know if I have Like enough time for that. I mean, might be a little, you know, so it's not just you've been busy and you haven't had time to get back to her. I mean, if you want to tell her that, okay, well, if it's a lie, I don't want to tell her that. Is there a particular reason? Like, did she do something wrong? No, no, she was awesome. I mean, I'm really into her. I mean, stop that, you know? Yeah, wait, usually when you're really into somebody, you don't call them back after a really awesome date. You don't know my situation, right? I know. I'm trying to find out your situation. I'm trying to see if I can help you out. Actually. Hold up, Jason, are you in a relationship? No, no, no, I'm not in a relationship right now. I'm single. Okay, so wait, why would you not call someone back that's awesome and that you're really into? Um, it's really complicated right now and I just don't want to really talk about it. Okay, well, can you tell us anything? Because here's the thing though, she really liked you and from the sounds of it, you really liked her. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I really do. And like, I will get in touch with her, right? But I'm telling you right now though, if you wait too long, that ship's gonna sail. Cause she actually did tell us that it's been so long since she's heard that she's just thinking about cutting it and not even trying anymore. Yeah. She doesn't wanna spend her days thinking about some guy that's not thinking about her. Like that's, you have to understand that she doesn't wanna waste your time. Uh, look, I really fucked up and, uh, and I, yeah. Okay. Well, can you tell us what happened? Yeah. All right. Just you're not gonna tell her? No, we'll tell her something else if it's that bad. Yeah. Like I want you guys to go out again cause you both liked each other. So try to figure out a way to sugarcoat it, I guess. Whatever it is.

But my daughter did something that made him turn pale. It was Thanksgiving at his parents house and I should have known better than to show up with store bought dinner rolls. For eight years of marriage to Derek, I had Learned that everything had to be perfect in front of his family or there would be consequences later. But I had been pulling 12 hour shifts at the hospital all week and barely had time to shower, let alone bake homemade bread. His mother, Patricia, made the first comment. As I set the plastic container on her perfectly set dining table, she lifted one roll with her manicured fingers like it might contaminate her entire meal. Well, she said, loud enough for the entire room to hear, I suppose not everyone has time for family traditions anymore. Twenty two family members were crammed into that dining room. His parents, both brothers with their wives, six kids ranging from toddlers to teenagers, and various aunts and uncles who had been in from neighboring towns. All of them turned to stare at me like I had committed some unforgivable sin. I forced a smile and explained that I had been working overtime at the hospital. Three nurses had called in sick with the flu and someone had to cover the emergency department. I thought they would understand. His father was a retired police officer. His brothers worked construction. They knew about demanding jobs. But Derek's face was already turning that familiar shade of red that meant trouble was coming. His jaw clenched the way it always did when he thought I had embarrassed him. The vein in his temple started throbbing. You always have an excuse, he said loudly enough to cut through every conversation in the room. The football game on TV suddenly seemed too loud. Someone's fork clinked against their plate. One of the toddlers asked for more juice, but nobody moved to help him. All eyes were on us. Now. I'm not making excuses, I said as calmly as I could manage. I'm explaining why I didn't have time to bake this week. That's when he hit me. The slap echoed through the dining room like a gunshot. My cheek exploded in pain, and I could taste blood where my teeth had cut the inside of my lip. The force of it knocked me sideways, and I had to grab the back of a chair to keep from falling. Complete silence fell over the room. Not one person moved. Not one person spoke. His father stared at his plate like it held the secrets of the universe. His mother suddenly developed an intense interest in folding and refolding her napkin. His brothers exchanged a quick glance, but immediately looked away. Even the children had gone completely quiet. Don't you ever embarrass me like that again! Derek hissed through clenched teeth. That's When my 16 year old daughter Chloe stood up from the kids table in the corner. She had been living with us for two years since her father died in a motorcycle accident. Derek had never liked her, always complained that she was too mouthy, too independent, too much like me for his taste. She walked over slowly, deliberately pulling her phone out of her back pocket as she moved. When she reached where Derek was standing, she held it up and aimed it directly at his face. Smile, she said with the sweetest voice imaginable. You're about to become very famous. Derek's angry red face drained to white so fast I thought he might pass out. His hands, which had been clenched into fists, started shaking. What the hell are you talking about? He demanded. I've been recording everything for the last hour, Chloe announced to the entire room. Every nasty comment, every threat, every single slap. And guess what, Uncle Derek? It's already uploaded to three different cloud servers. She turned to face his entire family, who were now staring at her like she'd grown a second head. Did you all know that in this state, witnessing domestic violence and failing to report it when children

My first few months as a 9 1 1 operator were scary, but nothing could have prepared me for when I got a call late at night from a young girl. I could barely understand what she was saying through her sobbing, but she told me she had just swallowed an entire bottle of pills and just wanted someone to talk to before they did anything. I started asking her why she would do that and asked for her address. She thought I already had it. But after a few minutes, she finally told me where she lived. She said she was severely depressed and just wanted everything to end. I asked her why, just trying to keep her on the phone and she said she couldn't take the hate she was getting anymore. I knew I only had literal minutes to do something and tried talking her into throwing up. She told me no. So I asked her what kind of hate she was getting. Apparently, she just wanted people to like her and wanted to help people. She was getting a lot of hate comments on TikTok and even people in real life. Then it all clicked. I knew I recognized her voice and I actually knew who she was. After a few minutes, I asked her if she was who I thought and she was really surprised. I started to tell her how one of her Videos actually changed my life and got me out of a toxic relationship. She knew I wasn't lying because I told her all about it. I asked her one more time and she finally agreed to try and make herself throw up. She was unconscious when the paramedics got there, but because of that, she was still alive. She now has millions of followers and I'm glad to see her much happier today.

I thought Doctor Martinez had seen everything, 23 years of experience, wrote the textbook on emotional regulation, had a waiting list longer than a CVS receipt. His office wall was covered in certificates, including one from the Dalai Lama. I was there because I'd gotten into a fist fight with a mall Santa. Not my proudest moment. Anger, Doctor Martinez said during our first session, is like holding a hot coal. You're only burning yourself. He had this perfectly calibrated therapist voice like NPR merged with a yoga instructor. Behind him sat a collection of stress balls shaped like world leaders heads. I noticed Nixon was particularly worn out. Session one was textbook. We explored my triggers, discussed coping strategies. He gave me a worksheet about identifying emotions. I pretended to care. He pretended to believe me. We were both professionals at this dance. Session 3, I mentioned my coworker Brad. Brad replies all to every email, even the automated ones. Brad clips his toenails at his desk. Brad pronounces it expresso and corrects others who say it right. Doctor Martinez's left eye twitched just once. Brad sounds challenging, he said, squeezing Stalin's head. Session 5 changed everything. I was ranting about my gym. They play the same Ed Sheeran song on repeat for three months. The same song. Doctor Martinez set down his notepad. Which song? Thinking out loud, he went pale. My gym plays shape of You four months, I've counted 847 times. By session seven, we'd abandoned all pretenses. He for us both coffee and we just vent. His mother in law moved in and rearranged his entire house while he was at work. My HOA, find me for my grass being 0.5 inches too tall. He got a parking ticket. While contesting a different parking ticket, I found out my ex was dating my dentist. Session 9, he told me about his colleague, Doctor Peterson. He steals my yogurt every day, writes his name on my yogurt, says he's conducting a social experiment on possession and ownership. I have a pee HD from Harvard. I don't need his experiments. I need my strawberry yo plate. Session 11 was when the universe chose violence. I walked in to find him on the phone. White knuckle Churchill ceramic head. What do you mean the insurance doesn't cover therapy for therapists? I am the therapy. He hung up, looked at me. My therapist just fired me. Said I was too negative. M E. I teach positivity seminars. Then his phone buzzed, a text from his teenage daughter. Dad, I'm dropping out to be an influencer. Also, I crashed your car into a subway. The restaurant, not the train. Something in his eyes changed like watching a documentary about damn failures. First a crack, then a trickle, then you know what? He stood up eerily calm. Buddha was wrong. Nisha was wrong. Young Freud, all of them wrong. He picked up his stress ball collection. Some people just need to be punched. Some situations don't have a breathing exercise sometimes. He launched Nixon at his diploma. The only path to inner peace is accepting that everyone else is the problem. He opened his window, started throwing everything out. Books, certificates, the meditation fountain that never worked anyway. Twenty three years of breathe and count to 10. You know what? I've been counting to 10 my whole life. I'm at like 84 million by now. His secretary knocked. Doctor Martinez, your three o'clock is here. Tell them to breathe and count to 10, he screamed, launching Roosevelt out the window. Security.

My husband's on the way home. I lied immediately feeling nervous from his question. The delivery driver held my Chinese food peeking into my house. What does your husband look like? He asked. Sorry, listen, I have a movie to catch. Here's an extra tip. I pushed a 5 dollar Bill at him and reached for my food. What does he look like? He pressed more desperately. His tone making all the hair on the back of my neck stand up straight. I grabbed my food and practically slammed the door in his face before turning the dead bolt. Now, I know weird people deliver food all the time, but I wasn't ready to become a true crime story that people we'll make YouTube videos about. But 20 minutes later, just as I'd forgotten all about him, I walked into the kitchen to get some ice cream and noticed that his car was still parked on the street with the engine running. When his eyes met mine through the window, I closed the blinds in a panic and fell to the floor covering my mouth. My phone buzzed with text from an unknown number. This is your delivery driver. Where is your husband? Are you still by yourself right now? I didn't respond, but my hands were shaking. Another text came through immediately. Please answer. It's important. Through a crack in the blinds, I watched him get out of His car and walk back toward my house. The pounding of my heart filled my ears. I crawled around, turning off all the lights, closing all the blinds on the first floor. Then a third text. I'm outside. Two words that made my spine tingle. I heard his footsteps on my front porch, gently knocking like he didn't want to scare me even more than I already was. Annabelle, he said, voice calm and eerie. Annabelle, I know you're in there. Please come out. I couldn't take it anymore and figured if I threatened him with the cops, he'd leave. I stupidly opened the door just a crack with the chain still on. You need to leave or I'm calling the police. Before I could react, his hand shot through the gap and unhooked the chain. He grabbed my arm and dragged me out of my house. I tried to scream but he was already throwing me into his back seat and slamming the door. I tried to leave but the child lock trapped me inside. I kicked at the window weakly, even screamed. As he calmly got into the driver seat. He reached down and pulled out a baseball bat that he said in the passenger seat, call the cops, he told me what I said. Suddenly thrown so far off, all the panic drained from my body in an instance. Call the cops now. He repeated it while staring straight ahead at my house. His hands were on The steering wheel. And he wasn't even looking at me. I fumbled with my phone and dialed 9, 1 1. There's a delivery driver. And he grabbed me and forced me into his car.

She thought it would secure her a payout until the judge asked one question. You ever see someone's face when their own lie destroys them? Because I got a front row seat to that exact moment. Natalie walked into that courtroom eight months pregnant, glowing with confidence. She'd been stalling our divorce for a year with every trick in the book, fake emergencies, missing paperwork, sudden mental health crisis that required postpone opponents. But this, this was her grand finale. The plan was obvious. Walk in looking vulnerable, play the abandoned pregnant wife card and watch the judge throw out our iron clad prenup out of pure sympathy. She'd done her research, too, picked a female judge thinking the sisterhood would work in her favor. What Natalie didn't realize was that her own paranoia had already destroyed wait her. Six months earlier during one of our screaming matches, she'd called the cops claiming I'd threatened her. Complete lie. But she ran with it, filed a restraining order. The next day, stood in front of a judge with crocodile tears claiming I was violent and dangerous, said she feared for her life and needed protect action. The judge bought it, granted the order immediately. I couldn't come within 500 feet of her, couldn't contact her, couldn't even drive down our old street. My lawyer advised me not to fight it, just let the divorce proceed and move on. So I did. Exactly That followed that restraining order to the letter. Didn't call, didn't text, didn't even look in her direction when I saw her at the grocery store. I had witnesses, security footage, phone records, everything proving I'd stayed away. But here's the thing about restraining orders that Natalie forgot. They create a paper for trail. Every violation gets documented. Every interaction gets recorded. The court system tracks everything. Fast forward to Today. Natalie strutted in wearing a designer maternity dress, one hand on her belly, the other clutching tissues for the Waterworks. It even brought her mother. For extra sympathy points, her lawyer started the sob story immediately, painted me as the classic deadbeat dad who'd abandoned his pregnant wife, talked about her financial hardship and how she'd been left with nothing while carrying our child. Natalie sat there nodding occasionally, dabbing her eyes, playing the victim to affection. She even threw in protective hand gestures over her belly whenever the lawyer mentioned my name. My lawyer stayed quiet, letting them dig their own grave. When it was his turn, he simply stood up and said, your honor, before we address any financial claims, I believe we need to clarify something important. That's when he pulled out the court records, restraining order application, the sworn statements, the police reports, everything Natalie had filed claiming I was a dangerous monster. The judge reviewed the documents, her expression growing serious. she looked up at Natalie and asked the question that ended everything. Miss Brooks, according to these records, you filed a restraining order. Six months.

Tobacco Harris Duke Legacy. Father owned a billion dollar company. The wedding was planned before our fifth date, scheduled for the family foundation's 100 anniversary gala. My parents had already commissioned the oil painting of our future children. Two weeks before the wedding, my brother called. We're adopting them. All three kids, Carlos and I are going to be dads. My heart broke. My parents first grandchildren, three of them, and they'd never know. Three kids who desperately needed grandparents never had a stable family. And my parents would rather pretend they didn't exist unless I thought. At our rehearsal dinner with 500 guests, including the governor at our table, I stood up for the toast, pulled out my phone. Before I marry Isabella, everyone should see who's missing. I. I took the photo on the wall, my brother and Carlos at the adoption ceremony. Three kids clinging to them like life rafts. The oldest 10, holding his straight a report card. The middle child in his soccer uniform. It overcame developmental delays and now LED his team. The youngest with her violin headed to state competition. Everyone gasped, shocked, unsure how to feel. My brother isn't dead. He's happy. He's married to a brilliant surgeon and these are your grandchildren. I looked at my parents that you'll never meet because your homophobic hatred matters more than three kids who need a family. My father stood up. Shake those Aren't real grandchildren. But Isabella's hypothetical children are. Children who don't exist are more real than three kids who call him daddy. My mother was crying, you're destroying everything. You destroyed everything when you threw away your son for liking the wrong gender, she yelled. The bloodline ends with him disgusted. The bloodline. Carlos saves babies for a living. My brother runs a free clinic. Those three kids were thrown away by their bloodlines. But sure, let's talk about legacy. The governor was already leaving. Isabella's family followed. The wedding was off before the appetizers arrived. Parents screamed about the shame, the ruined foundation gala, the million dollar wedding they couldn't get refunded. Good. I said, now you know how those three kids felt when their biological families threw them away. Except my brother chose them. You're throwing away grandchildren who already exist. Kicked me out that night. Drained my accounts, too. But I'd already taken out loans already matched at a residency program. I already knew where I was going. My brother opened his door at midnight. We just held each other and cried. That was five years ago. I'm Uncle Rob now. Help with homework, teach the oldest premed concepts since he tests at college level. Watch the middle one score soccer goals at front row at violin recitals. Those three kids my parents said weren't real. They're honor students, athletes, musicians. They're loved. My parents still tell people they have no children. Spent 3 million on fertility treatments. For my cousin rather than acknowledge three grandchildren exist.

I was deep in my work when I heard what sounded like someone knocking over chairs in the break room. Then Derek, our newly promoted director, came stumbling out with his face already going puffy and red. His hands were at his throat, and he was making these horrible wheezing sounds. Epipen! He gasped, fumbling at his pockets. Can't breathe. Someone called 9 1 1 while another co worker helped him with the Epipen. In the chaos, I ran to see what happened and found my purple container open on the counter. My pad Thai was half eaten, and my name in black marker stared up at me like an accusation. The peanut sauce was still Visible on the fork. My boss called me into his office the next day. I have to ask, I said, looking uncomfortable, did you know Derek had a peanut allergy? I told him I had no idea. Derek and I barely interact, and it's not like he wore a medical alert bracelet or ever mentioned it. I pulled out that day's lunch, which was also pad Thai, because I made a huge batch and ate several bites in front of him. This is literally what I eat three times a week, I said. He nodded, seeming satisfied. Derek shouldn't have taken your food. This is on him. I thought that was the end of it. Then a week later, HR called me in for a formal investigation. Derek sat there with the HR director, arms crossed, explaining how I'd obviously targeted him. She's been jealous ever since my promotion, he said, giving me this condescending look. He claimed he only borrowed food when he had back to back meetings, like it was some noble sacrifice. She left it right in front like they. The HR director, a woman I'd never seen smile, was bizarrely aggressive. When my boss tried to defend me by saying the container was clearly labeled, she wouldn't even look at him. We can't prove Derek stole anything, she said. For all we know, you offered it to him. This looks like a calculated attack on someone in a vulnerable position. Then she actually suggested Derek should Sue me for reckless endangerment and emotional distress from nearly dying. My boss kept trying to interject, but she steamrolled over him every time. This could be considered assault, she said, leaning forward. You brought a deadly weapon into the workplace. It's pad Thai, I said. It's food. My food with my name on it. Two days later, I was called into HR and fired on the spot. She seized her opportunity perfectly. With the owner gone on business for the past month, she knew no one could stop her. She cited workplace endangerment and malicious intent, then had security escort me through the office with my belongings in a cardboard box, making sure everyone saw me leave like some kind of criminal. The humiliation lasted about as long as my drive home, but

My girlfriend came home at 2:00am with her underwear and dress torn open screaming for me to help her. She collapsed into my arms and I could feel her whole body trembling. She kept throwing up and shaking all over our carpet. I helped her to the couch and got her a glass of water while trying to stay calm myself because I was sure my worst fear just happened. Luna is without a doubt the strongest person I know. She worked as a prosecutor and dealt with assailers, PDF files and slaughterers every day without flinching. But now she looked broken and small, literally rocking on our couch, kept apologizing for ruining my night, which made no sense. And I assured her she did nothing wrong. At the club, some guy had cornered her outside the bathroom when she was alone. According to her, he towered over her, was super muscular and his breath reek of whiskey. He pushed her against the wall and put his hands where they didn't belong while she screamed for help. The music was too loud and her friends were too far away. She tried to fight back but he already had his way with her. The worst part was what happened next. Luna found security and told them exactly what occurred. She pointed out the guy who was laughing with his friends near the VIP section. The bouncer just shrugged and said, what do You want me to do without any witnesses, lady? he leaned in close and told her that the guy was the owner's nephew, so maybe she should just go home and sleep it off and that it probably wasn't that bad. I felt rage building in my chest as Juna explained how the manager said the same thing, how her friends wanted to call the police, but the staff threatened to ban them, all of them, from every club in a 5 mile radius for causing trouble. Literally. Other women at the club whispered that the same guy had done this before, but nothing ever happened. Police protected him because his uncle owned three clubs in the city. Juno was a prosecutor who put criminals away for a living, but even she knew this would go nowhere. Rich guys with connections didn't face consequences for raping women in dark clubs. There would be no cameras in that hallway and no witnesses willing to testify. The system she worked for every day had failed her completely. I held her while she cried and felt more helpless than ever before in my life. I didn't know people who could handle this kind of thing. There was nothing I could do that would touch that man. But then I remembered that my father would know what to do. My dad had spent 30 years working construction in the roughest parts of the city. He knew people from a different world than mine. People who handled problems outside the law when the law wouldn't help. I spent my whole life trying to distance myself from that part of his past, but now I needed it. The next morning while Juno was sleeping, I drove to my parents house. My dad was drinking coffee in the garage like always, surrounded by his tools and old boxing trophies. I told him everything and watched his face go from confused to furious. He sat down his mug so hard it spilled everywhere. You know the guy's name? He asked in a voice I'd never heard before. I showed him the club's Instagram where the nephew was tagged in VIP photos flashing expensive watches and bottles. My dad studied the pictures like he was memorizing every detail of the guy's face. My father made some calls right there in the garage. I could only hear his side of the conversations, but they were short and serious. He used names I didn't recognize and mentioned favours that were owed. When he hung up, he told me to go home and take care of Junah. He said he would handle everything else. Three days later, the local news reported that the club owner's nephew had been found in an alley behind one of his uncle's properties. Both his hands were broken in multiple places. His ribs were all broken, his eyes were swollen and he had a 1,000 dollar bottle of tequila shoved up his bum, the report said. No witnesses came forward and no cameras covered that particular alley, so they couldn't prosecute anyone. The interesting part was what they found in his apartment during.

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother, so one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his work bench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice. And I apologized over and over. I, I promised I would talk to him, but deep down, I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, I said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night, just stood in the doorway clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development, their church pastor who believed homosexuality was a choice. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp Restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires, just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We were Constantly monitored, no privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One, one night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents.

At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night, just stood in the doorway clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development, their church pastor who believed homosexuality was a choice. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp Restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires, just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We were Constantly monitored, no privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One, one night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

Not my parents, not even my sister. They all went to my brother Diego's B B Q. Instead. As I opened gifts from two co workers, my phone lit up. Mom's text, answer the phone. Then 67 missed calls. I had my baby shower last Saturday, but all I could see were the empty chairs, my current spots, the place my sister should have been sitting, the seat my best friend Valentina, who'd organized everything with me, promised to fill. Every single person who mattered had chosen Diego's Backyard BBQ, an event he announced three weeks after I'd sent my invitations. And my family picked him. His invites went out by personal phone call. Diego got on with each relative, chatting about his new smoker, the craft beer selection, how perfect the weather would be. Mine got a thumbs up emoji in the family group chat. When I sent out my baby shower invites two months ago, my mom texted, we'll see what we can do. My dad left me on read three days before the shower. I called to confirm. The pause told me everything before she spoke. Camilla, it's tough, my mom said finally. Diego's doing this whole thing for his promotion. His boss is coming, so you understand we need to be there. My voice cracked. Her sigh was theatrical, condescending. When you have your second baby, you'll get it. These work things matter. That gutted me entirely. But the killing Blow came the morning of when Valentina texted, can't make it, babe. Diego invited my boyfriend, and it would be weird if I didn't go with him. Sorry. I sat in the room trying to keep it together. My husband Mateo, stood by me. The two co workers meant well, but those empty chairs felt like verdicts. I managed to hold it together until the gifts. Pink wrapping paper between my fingers, unopened boxes stacking up when my phone exploded. Answer your phone now! My mom. Then another ping. Then another. 67 missed calls in 40 minutes. The polite conversation around me dissolved into static. It was my cousin Jasmine, the only one who ever warned me about things, who broke through. She texted, Camilla, you won't believe what they're saying. Call now. Keep this between us. I escaped to the porch into the afternoon heat. Jasmine answered, whispering like someone might overhear. They're trashing you, Camilla. Telling everyone you intentionally planned your shower to sabotage Diego's promotion Celebration. Your mom's leading the charge. That's insane. I choked. My shower was planned months before he even got promoted. Doesn't matter. Your dad's backing her up. And Valentina's here telling people you've been demanding and jealous since getting pregnant. Everyone's buying it. My legs felt weak.

It's coming. What's coming? I asked, setting down my water bottle on the bench. She was gripping my Jersey with one hand and holding her stomach with the other. Her face twisted in a way that made me think she was about to throw up. I thought she needed help with her skirt or something, but then she screamed at me. More like all the air being forced out of her lungs at once. Suddenly, she collapsed behind our bench, holding her stomach, and I started looking for her boyfriend. She was dating Owen, our starting quarterback, and they've been together since sophomore year. Help me, please. Get someone! She gasped, and I'd never run so fast in my life. I didn't know who to get. I couldn't see a single girl in sight, so I grabbed the next best person. Our coach took one look at Jenna, and his eyes went wide under the stadium lights. And I kept saying, it's too early. It's not supposed to happen yet. Which didn't make any sense, because what was too early? Our coach started freaking out. Before telling me to stay with Jenna, he went and grabbed one of our teachers, missus Pruitt, from the stands. And as I kneeled next to her, I asked what was wrong. She was holding her stomach. And then it hit me. Jenna was having a baby right here. During homecoming. The crowd was starting to notice something was wrong because we'd formed this weird huddle behind the bench. The referees were blowing their whistles, wondering why half our team wasn't on the field. Owen came jogging over in his quarterback year, asking what was wrong with his girlfriend, and Jenna grabbed my hand so hard, I thought she'd break it. Don't let him see! You can't let him see the baby, she whispered to me. But Owen was already trying to get there. Everyone in the stands were freaking out over what was happening, and every student was trying to see what was going on. The cheerleading squad had formed this protective circle around Jenna, but you could still hear her screaming over the marching band that was trying to play through their halftime show. We need to get her to the ambulance, missus Pruitt said. But when two players tried to lift Jenna, she screamed so loud, the referees actually stopped the game completely. No! The baby's come!

Mia says Jennifer shouldn't go. She says. She says the road will be angry. I didn't know what to do. Do you call someone and say my five year old had a premonition about your death? But the teacher begged me. She canceled her sister's trip, made up an excuse about family emergency. November 14th came and went. Nothing happened. I felt ridiculous. Maybe everyone was right. Maybe Mia was just an anxious kid with an overactive imagination. Then we saw the news.

Another Valentina's party photo we weren't invited to. Another, dad's voicemail asking me to cover Joshua's truck payment. I didn't yell. I just told the truth. The table went silent. Joshua's smirk vanished. Mom looked slapped. Dad's face turned red. Before we talk about contributions, I want everyone to understand why we won't be participating. We've been excluded from birthdays, vacations, Christmas. That stops tonight. I pulled out my business card, listing me as owner. I don't need your money. I don't need your fund. I don't need anything from you except distance. I stood. You wanted me to set the tone. Consider it set. I walked out, leaving the papers behind. The next morning, my phone exploded. Mom called. I can't believe you embarrassed us. Didn't embarrass you. I just showed everyone what you've been hiding. You didn't have to do it in front of everyone. Yes, I did. If I said it privately, you'd have brushed it off. Over the next weeks, relatives reached out. An aunt admitted she'd been biting her tongue for years. A cousin apologized for never inviting my kids. Three weeks later, mom and dad showed up at my shop. We didn't realize how bad it had gotten. Mom said softly, if you want to Be part of their lives. It has to be on equal terms. No more secret parties, no special treatment. Mom nodded slow. We'll try that weekend. The group chat pinged. Dinner Sunday, everyone invited. When we arrived, there were four gift bags by the door. Two with Joshua's kids names, two with mine. Madeline's face lit up when she saw hers. Watching my kids laugh and feel included for the first time in years, I realized this was what I've been fighting for all along.

The man had contact to them. Said a little girl at the store had saved his life. He'd planned to end things that evening, had the pills in his car. But something my daughter said made him call a crisis line instead. The site chiropractor said she had heightened anxiety and hypervigilance, possibly from trauma. But Mia had no trauma. We'd given her the safest, most loving childhood possible. The psychologist said she was exceptionally intuitive and might be reading micro expressions subconsciously. But that didn't explain the incident. At school, Mia's kindergarten teacher called me in for An urgent meeting. She looked terrified. Your daughter drew this during free time, she said, sliding a picture across the desk. It was a woman lying in red, a car on its side, a date written in crayon. November 14. That's my sister, the teacher whispered. That's Jennifer. She's borrowing my car this week.

No, don't let him touch me! He hurts the little ones. I was mortified. Doctor Harrison looked shocked, but tried to approach her gently. Mia threw herself on the floor, hyperventilating, pointing at him. His hands are red. His hands are red. We left immediately. I apologized profusely. He said children sometimes react strangely to doctors. But Mia had never done this before. Not with him, not with anyone. Three weeks later, Doctor Harrison was arrested. They found thousands of images on his computer. He'd been abusing patients for years. The youngest was 18 months old. I threw up when I saw the news. My husband held me while I sobbed.

She suddenly became possessive. My girlfriend made me change out of the festive sweater I knitted for her work's holiday party because she said everyone would know it was homemade and her coworkers were fashion people who notice things like that. I wore my black henley instead and watched her abandon me the second we entered the apartment to air kiss her marketing team by the gold balloon arch while I stood alone, hanging both our coats in the closet like her personal assistant. Within five minutes, she was posing for Instagram Stories, and I was standing by the kitchen island arranging crackers on my tiny plate and pretending anyone else at this party might acknowledge my existence. Oh, my god, that sweater is absolutely insane. A woman with purple highlights practically materialized beside me, staring at my clothes. I look down at my plain black shirt, confused, until she pointed at the Fair Isle cardigan draped over my arm that I knitted for my girlfriend and hoped she'd wear to the party. Did you seriously make this yourself? Because I'm going to lose my mind if you did. Before I could answer, she was already touching the sleeve and examining the pattern up close. The colors blend together like an actual sunset. And these stitches are so perfect, they look machine made. But she held it up to the Light and gasped. Wait. Are these your girlfriend's initials worked into the pattern? That's the most romantic thing I've ever seen. My stomach dropped because, yes, those were her initials hidden in the color work, and she'd never even noticed them. Your girlfriend must die every time you make her something. This beautiful woman was already putting the cardigan on over her dress. I need you to understand that I would wear this every single day until I died. Something in my chest unclenched for the first time in months because finally, someone actually saw what I'd create.

Families would pack the place from Friday through Sunday, and every single regular family had their own special way they wanted their breakfast. I've been preparing special seasoned meats for weeks that customers have been asking about, marinating them just right with my own blend of spices I perfected over the years. Carlos had never bothered to learn any of this stuff because he was too busy talking about portion control and standardized recipes. But our. Our customers were families who've been coming for generations and wanted their food exactly how they remembered it from when their parents brought them as kids. Saturday morning came, and at 6 a m. Sharp, my phone started going off. I ignored it and made myself some coffee. By 6:45, Carlos had called eight times. At 7:15, Elena texted me. Miguel, it's crazy here. Where did you write down how to make Antonio's plate? Carlos is freaking out. I texted back. Everything should be in the kitchen somewhere. There's nothing here. Just the regular menu recipes. Of course there wasn't anything written down. All those special orders lived in my head. Like Don Roberto's Saturday special with my secret salsa blend that took me three years to perfect. Or Maria's eggs with that specific combination of peppers she'd been ordering for 15 years. I knew exactly how much of each spice to use, which vendors sold the Best chilies. And how every regular liked their tortillas toasted. At 8:30, Elena called me directly. Miguel, Don Roberto's whole family is here for their monthly gathering. 12 people and they all want their usual orders. I was asking for you specifically. I wish I could help, I said, and I really meant it, because I liked on Roberto and his family. By 9 a m, owner Rosa Herrera called, begging me

Nothing we can do. But I literally have a ring camera showing no one came. Doesn't matter. The driver confirmed delivery. In October, the same thing happened with sushi. The 40 dollar order just vanished. This time I was ready. I had screenshots, camera footage, time stamps. The support agent actually laughed at me. Not our problem if someone stole it after delivery. But no one delivered anything. I watched my door for an hour. They ended the chat while I was typing. The third strike came two weeks later. Pizza for my nephew's birthday. The kid was heartbroken. So court's response? You've requested too many refunds. Account flagged for fraud. We won't be processing any more complaints. Fraud? I'd lost $130 on food that never showed up. They kept suggesting I was scamming them. The fourth agent straight up called me a liar. Maybe you should pick up your own food if you can't figure out how doors work. These people had stolen from me three times, insulted me, then blocked me from complaining. If they insisted on wasting my time, I'd Make sure I wasn't the only one suffering. It started simple.

When I asked what allowance, his face went white. For four months, I've been grinding three jobs tutoring high school kids, weekend event staffing and bar shifts until 2:00am, classes until three PM, then straight to tutoring until 6. Quick dinner of instant noodles, then bar work until closing. I get home at 3:00am, study until 5, sleep for two hours, repeat. Surviving on ramen packets and day old bread. When textbooks cost $400 each, I photocopy pages at the library. My friends go out Thursday nights while I'm serving drinks to businessmen who tip in singles. My bank account never goes above $200. Every dollar is calculated. $50 for groceries, $30 for laundry. I wear the same three shirts, and my shoes have holes I cover with duct tape. Meanwhile, my sister Mariah floods Instagram from Paris. Designer coffee at trendy cafes, weekend trips to Monaco. New Dior dresses with captions like mom always knows exactly what I need. Hashtag blessed, hashtag fashion life. When I begged mom for even $200 for groceries, she sighed heavily. Money's tight. Your father's practice is struggling. Paying your tuition is already stretching us. I worked harder, picked up extra shifts, skipped meals to save money. Last Friday, everything changed. I was carrying cocktails when the room started spinning. I remember reaching for the bar to steady myself. Then nothing. I woke up in a hospital bed with an IV. The doctor was Stern, you collapsed from exhaustion and malnutrition. Your blood sugar was dangerously low. My bar manager visited, looking guilty, even working doubles every weekend, the rest of the month off. That meant losing $1,200 in income I desperately needed. My friend visited with groceries and made me spaghetti. While eating, the first real meal I'd had in weeks, said something that shattered my world. Your dad's a surgeon with a luxury car. You went to private school. How is your sister affording Paris? If money's so tight, you're working yourself into the hospital? That night, I called Mariah directly. Just checking in. How's Paris? Amazing. Mom just sent me the cutest Chanel bag for my birthday next month. My stomach dropped. How are you managing financially? Paris must be expensive. Oh, I don't worry about that. Mom transfers me about $3,000 a month, plus extra whenever I need something special. $3,000 a month plus extras? While I was told there wasn't a single dollar to spare. At Sunday dinner, when dad asked about my allowance, I watched our family explode. What do you mean? Dad's voice was confused. I've been sending $2,000 every month since you started school. Mom kept cutting her pot roast, not looking up. Where is Henry's money? Dad asked mom. Silence stretched forever. I haven't sent any money to Henry. What? Why not? I've been keeping it for Mariah. She needs it more. She's studying fashion in Paris. It's expensive. She needs to look the part. Dad's face turned white. You've been withholding Henry's allowance, letting him work himself into a hospital while secretly sending thousands to Mariah for shopping. Mariah has potential. She's special. She's delicate. He's exactly like you. He'll be fine. He doesn't need help. And Henry doesn't have potential? He's studying medicine. That's exactly it. He's practical. Mariah needs more support. The truth kept getting worse. $3,000 monthly for living expenses. Another 2,000 to 3,000 some months for networking events, proper clothes, accessories.

I thought I was imagining things at first. Me and my girlfriend Rachel were sitting on the living room floor with 10 month old Emma trying to get her to say anything. You know how it is with babies. You make all those stupid faces and weird sounds hoping they'll copy you. Rachel was doing the classic mama, mama, mama thing while waving her hands around like a complete maniac. I was on the other side doing my best dad voice going Dada, Dada, come on, sweetie. Emma just sat there in her little pink onesie chewing on her fingers and staring at us like we were the biggest idiots on the planet, which let's be honest, we probably were. Then my phone buzzed with another YouTube notification. I've been binge watching this tech review channel all week and apparently I'd forgotten to turn off notifications. Without thinking, I grabbed my phone and set out. God, I need to unsubscribe from this guy. Emma's head snapped toward me. Her eyes went wide. Then clear as day she looked right at me and said unsubscribe. Perfect pronunciation, three syllables like she'd been practicing. Rachel stopped mid mama and stared. I dropped my phone. We both looked at Emma who had this huge grin on her face like she knew she'd just blown our minds. She clapped her little hands together and said it again, unsubscribe. Pediatrician told us it was Perfectly normal. Kids pick up whatever words they hear most often. And apparently I've been saying unsubscribe way more than either Mama or Dada. That week, Rachel was not happy. She kept giving me these dirty looks like it was somehow my fault our daughter's first word was a YouTube feature instead of something sweet and meaningful. But here's where it gets weird. Emma became obsessed with that word. She he'd crawl around the house saying unsubscribe to everything, the cat, her toys, the TV. When she was hungry, instead of crying, she'd look at her empty bottle and say unsubscribe like she was canceling her milk subscription. Two weeks later, I'm at target with Emma in the cart. He's being super good, just sitting there playing with her little stuffed elephant. Then this random lady walks up, you know the type, the one who thinks every baby in public belongs to everyone. She starts making baby talk at Emma, doing that high pitched voice thing. Oh, what a cute little girl. Can you say hi to me, sweetie? Can you wave? Emma looks at this lady for a second, tilts her head and then says in the clearest voice ever, unsubscribe. Lady's face went from sweet grandma mode to completely confused. She looked at me like I'd taught my baby to curse at strangers. I just shrugged and said she's very selective about her content.

My sister died when my niece Chloe was 12 and her dad basically disappeared after that. So Chloe moved in with me and my husband. He was this quiet kid who barely talked for the first year, which honestly broke my heart because my sister was the loudest person alive. By the time Chloe turned 15, she started opening up more. She tell me about school, drama, boys she thought were cute, normal teenage stuff. But then junior year, she started acting different. She get weird when her friends talked about guys and she stopped mentioning crushes all together. I figured she was just focusing on school. One night she was helping me make dinner when she goes, Aunt Jamie, what would you do if someone in our family was gay? I'm stirring pasta sauce trying to act casual and I said something like, love them the exact same way I always have. She got quiet after that. A few weeks later, she brought home this girl named Alex for a study session, except they weren't studying anything. They we're sitting way too close on the couch sharing earbuds and Chloe was laughing more than I'd seen in years. When Alex left, Chloe had this dopey smile that gave everything away. I didn't say anything because I wanted her to tell me when she was ready. But then my mom called last month asking if Chloe Was dating anyone. My mom's old school Catholic, the type who still thinks being gay is a choice and that prayer can fix everything. She started going on about how she couldn't wait for Chloe to find a nice boy and settle down. That's when I realized the problem. See, my sister left Chloe a pretty big inheritance that she gets when she turns 18. But there's a catch. My mom controls it until then. And knowing my mom, if she found out Chloe was gay, she'd probably find some way to mess with that money or make Chloe's life hell. So when Chloe finally came out to me last week, I was in my kitchen at midnight, scared I'd kick her out. I hugged her tight and told her I was proud of her. But then I said, listen, you need to keep this between us for now. Your grandma can't know until you get your inheritance. She looked confused. So I explained the whole situation, how grandma still thinks gay people are going to hell, how she controls the money, how we only have to wait six more months until Chloe turns 18. Chloe got upset and said she was tired of hiding who she was. I, I told her I wasn't asking her to hide forever, just to be smart about it. Bring Alex over whenever you want, I said. Be yourselves here, but around grandma maybe. Don't mention the girlfriend part yet. She called me a Coward and locked herself in her room for two days. My husband thinks I'm wrong, too, says we shouldn't let my mom's bigotry control our choices. I've seen how nasty my mom can get when she disapproves of something. I cut off my cousin for getting pregnant at 19 and didn't speak to him for three years. Six months feels like forever when you're 17 and in love. But that inheritance could pay for Chloe's college, maybe help her buy a house someday. It's her mom's money, money my sister saved specifically for Chloe's future.

Three months ago, Maddie had supposedly been brought in for extreme emotional distress and anxiety, with notes about nightmares and separation anxiety after weekends with me. Complete fiction. Maddie was always happy during our time together. The morning of the hearing, Scarlet's lawyer painted me as unstable and aggressive, dramatically describing the crosswalk incident as a violent rage. He had a therapist testify I about Maddie's anxiety, though she'd only seen Maddie twice, both times in the past month. When it was our turn, my lawyer presented evidence of my involvement in Maddie's life and raised concerns about the mysterious Epipen fabricated medical records. The judge looked troubled. These are serious allegations, council. Do you have evidence? We do, your honor, my lawyer replied. And there's something else the court should hear. She nodded to me. I pulled out my phone. Your honor, I received this voicemail yesterday. It was left on my daughter's tablet by accident. Maddie had left her tablet at my house the previous weekend. While charging it, a voicemail notification popped up. Checked it, and what I heard made my blood run cold. I pressed play, and Scarlett's voice filled the courtroom. Maddie, I don't care what your father told you. You will tell Doctor Morris that you feel scared at your dad's house. Do you understand me? I am not dealing with another custody hearing because you can't follow simple Instructions? Do you have any idea what you've put me through? The stretch marks, the weight, the ruined body. The least you could do is cooperate for once in your life. If you mess this up tomorrow, there will be serious consequences. No more dance classes, no more playdates with Emma. Nothing. Got

My kid was still an afterthought. The night of the party, I took Leo to the park. We shot free throws until the sky turned orange. Got milkshakes. I didn't check my phone after 11 p m. Aunt Nora texted. They seated grandma next to a fountain with strobe lights. Couldn't see her food. Your sister spent half the night yelling at everyone. When the Bill came, no one made eye contact with your mother. You missed nothing. I watched my son fall asleep with chocolate on his lip and realized I wasn't the family ATM anymore. I was just Leo's dad.

For the first hour, Haley's lawyer painted Ryan as controlling and manipulative. He claimed Ryan forced her into an inappropriate relationship. Then we presented our evidence. 60 pages of proof. The daycare teacher testified that Ryan knew everything about his daughter, including her favorite toy, her allergies, her exact bedtime routine. Haley didn't even know her daughter's teacher's name. The pediatrician confirmed Ryan never missed one appointment, while Haley had been to exactly zero. Her own Instagram became evidence against her, showing her partying while Ryan was home doing bedtime. During recess, Haley cornered me in the Bathroom with mascara running down her face. She said, you're destroying me because he chose me. I dried my hand slowly and told her, I'm showing the court who actually raises that little girl. The judge gave Ryan primary custody, and Haley only got supervised weekends. Outside court. Ryan thanked me and said leaving me was his biggest mistake. I told him it was the best thing that happened to me. Two months later, he texted me that the dentist had left Haley. She tried the same manipulation story on him.

The plumber says it's coming from the unit down the hall. The bathroom ceiling collapsed. The plumber discovered a slow leak in the shared wall between my rental and Eliza's apartment. When they opened the wall, accumulated water released, causing major damage to both units. Building declared both apartments uninhabitable for three to four weeks. I didn't cause the leak. It was genuine maintenance. But the timing was perfect. She calls that evening. Where am I supposed to go? I hear Kyle has a nice place. You know about everything. Security cameras. Eliza, did you think I wouldn't notice two Weeks later, my friend texts see Instagram. Kyle had posted weekend photos with a woman who wasn't Eliza.

I helped them out professionally. She started helping with my marketing materials. Everything seemed collaborative. Then came my 29th birth. Eliza organized everything. Dinner at an upscale place, inviting our closest friends. The day before, she casually mentioned. Oh, by the way, I invited Kyle, too. Kyle? Your ex? Yeah. Is that okay? He's just a friend now. Something felt off, but I didn't want to seem insecure. Sure, whatever. The night arrived. Table for eight at this beautiful restaurant. We're having drinks, waiting on Kyle. He shows up 20 minutes late with purple dahlias. Eliza's beaming. Kyle hands her the flowers, completely ignoring me. These are for you. He Says, happy spring. It's October. Eliza accepts them, face lighting up purple dahlias. It's sweet that you still remember what I like. The table goes silent. Everyone's looking, from Kyle to Eliza, to me. Kyle finally acknowledges me with a nod. Happy birthday, man. No flowers for the birthday boy. Dinner proceeds like I'm invisible. Kyle dominates conversation, sharing inside jokes with Eliza. He's positioned directly across from her, making constant eye contact. I'm supposedly the guest of honor, but might as well be a ghost. The

You're too embarrassing. I replied, understood. Then I showed up to her elite country club as the owner's son. When she saw me shaking hands with her friends. Victoria and I had been together three years, engaged for six months. She recently got accepted into this exclusive country club through her boss's sponsorship. Everything changed when she got in. Suddenly, every weekend was about the club. Tennis, charity lunches, wine tastings. Then came the conversation that ended everything. Last Tuesday, she was getting ready for some gala. I asked, when do I get to meet these new friends? She stopped applying makeup and gave me this look. Daniel, these people are different. They're refined. They discuss investments and art, not carburetors and fishing. You'd be uncomfortable, and frankly, you'd embarrass me. Your job, your hobbies, your too blue collar for that environment. I stared at her. Three years together, living in my house, wearing the ring I bought, and I'm too embarrassing. Understood? I said. After she left, I made a phone call I've been avoiding for two years. Here's what Victoria didn't know. That country club she was so proud of joining. My father built it from scratch in 1987. When he. He died five years ago, he left it to me and my sister Eleanor. I never mentioned it because I wanted nothing to do with it. Dad thought I was wasting my life being a mechanic. Instead of wearing a suit, Eleanor runs the business side. I'm a silent partner who just signs papers once a year. After Victoria's speech, I called Eleanor. I need to visit the club Saturday. There's a charity auction, right? You haven't set foot there since Dad's funeral. Is this about that woman you're seeing? Eleanor handles membership approval.

For 3 years straight, Danny would act surprised when my birthday rolled around. First year he said work was crazy and he'd make it up to me. Second year he claimed his phone died so he lost track of dates. Last year he literally asked me why I seemed upset on February 15th, like he had no clue it was the day after my birthday. Meanwhile, this guy remembered every sports stat from 1995 and could tell you exactly when his favorite show aired each week. He had phone reminders for oil changes, dentist appointments, even when to water his plants. But somehow my birthday was this impossible thing to keep track of. My friends kept telling me to just remind him or send hints, but that felt pathetic. If some someone cares about you, they remember what matters to you without being nagged about it. This year, I decided to test something. Two weeks before my birthday, I started dropping hints everywhere. I left my birth certificate on the kitchen counter. I circled February 14th on the calendar with a big red heart. I even mentioned it during dinner. My birthday is coming up soon, I said, while we ate tacos. He just nodded and kept scrolling his phone. The week before, I got more obvious. I showed him a dress online and said this would be perfect for my birthday dinner next week. He mumbled something about it. Being nice and went back to watching TV. Three days before, I literally said, so what are we doing for my birthday Thursday? He looked confused and asked, what's Thursday? When I told him it was my birthday, he slapped his forehead like he always did and said, right? Yeah, I've been so busy with work stuff. Thursday morning came. I woke up expecting something, anything, maybe flowers by my bedside or breakfast in bed. Nothing. He got dressed, kissed my cheek and said he'd be back late because of a client dinner. Not even a happy birthday. I sat there in my pajamas until noon feeling stupid for hoping things would be different this year. Then I remembered something. His birthday was exactly one month later, March 14th. And for the past four years, I'd thrown him surprise parties, bought expensive gifts, took days off work to plan special celebrations. That's when I made my decision. I spent my actual birthday doing something I'd never done before. I went shopping alone, bought myself the exact dress I'd shown him, got my nails done and treated myself to dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. The waiter even brought me free cake when I mentioned it was my birthday. For the next month, every time Danny mentioned his upcoming birthday, I played dumb. When he showed me golf clubs online and said these would be perfect for my birthday, I just said, cool and kept folding laundry. When he asked, what Restaurant we should book for his birthday dinner. I told him I hadn't really thought about it. When he mentioned taking the day off work to celebrate, I said that sounded nice and changed the subject. March 14th arrived. I woke up early, got dressed for work like any normal day and started making coffee. Danny came downstairs in his favorite shirt, clearly expecting something special. Morning, I said, not looking up from my phone. It's my birthday, he said, waiting for my reaction. I looked up, pretended to think for a second.

Your family canceled your invitation, but asked to keep the 50 thousand dollar deposit you paid. I said cancel the entire wedding. The call came Tuesday morning while I was editing a commercial in my home studio. This is Renee from Perfect Day Planning calling about Jared's wedding next month. Her voice sounded uncomfortable. I have some difficult news. Your family contacted us yesterday and asked us to remove you from the guest list entirely. They mentioned some family disagreements and said you wouldn't be welcome at the ceremony or reception. I paused my editing software. My family still sees me as the 29 year old college dropout who threw his life away to become a freelance videographer. What they don't know is what I actually do with all that video equipment filling my garage. However, Renee continued nervously, they also specifically requested to keep the 50 thousand dollar deposit you paid for the wedding videography pack. Missus Ruth said the family had already allocated those funds to other wedding expenses and couldn't possibly return them. I leaned back in my chair looking at the wall of awards behind me. Emmy nominations, industry recognition, contracts with Fortune 500 company. My little video hobby had quietly become a 15 million dollar production company over the past eight years. Renee, I need to ask you something important. What's the name of your wedding venue? The Riverside Manor downtown. And who owns that property? I heard papers shuffling on Her end. Um, it's listed under Sunset Holdings, LLC, right? What about your catering company? Golden Plate Catering Services. Also owned by longer pause. Sunset Holdings, LLC as well. Wait, what's going on here? The photography studio handling the wedding photos. Elite Moment Studio. Oh, my god. That's also Sunset Holdings. The florist providing all the arrangements, Bella's Garden Creations. That's. That's you, too, isn't it? The DJ company, the luxury transportation service, the rehearsal dinner venue, even the hotel block for out of town guests. All owned by Sunset Holdings, LLC. Which is my company. Renee's voice went up an octave. Mister Ruth, are you telling me that you own every single vender for this wedding? I'm telling you that for the past eight months, I've been secretly funding my brother's entire dream wedding through shell companies I created. Every vendor, every service, every single detail of this wedding, all paid for by me through different LLCs, so my family wouldn't know their disappointment. Son was actually footing the entire Bill for everything. This can't be happening. When I dropped out of film school seven years ago, my parents told everyone I was throwing my life away. While they focused on Jared's safe marketing career at his corporate job, I was quietly building a production empire. Corporate videos, national commercials, award winning documentaries. I work with Netflix, HBO, major advertising agencies. But to my family, I'm still just a failure who plays with cameras. Sir, what exactly are you Saying? I'm saying cancel everything. The venue rental, catering contract, floral arrangements, photography package, DJ services, transportation, all of it. Every single contract goes through companies I own. the wedding is in three weeks. There. There are 180 confirmed guests coming. Then they better start making phone calls fast. I want every vendor canceled by close of business today. Send the Ruth and Miller families a complete itemized Bill.

I thought I was doing everything right after my husband died. Making pancakes shaped like dinosaurs, never missing a soccer practice, smiling through parent teacher conferences while my chest felt like it was caving in. My daughter Ava, was only 3 when the accident happened. She was too young to really understand that her dad wasn't coming back from his work trip. I kept telling myself I had to be strong for her. That's what good moms do, right? They hold it together. They don't fall apart in front of their kids. So I cried in the shower. I cried in my car before picking her up from daycare. I cried into my pillow at two in the morning. But never in front of Ava. Never where she could see the cracks forming. For eight months, I played this role. The happy mom. The one who had everything under control. I packed her lunch with little notes inside. I took her to the park every Saturday. I read her three books before bed, even when I was so exhausted I could barely see straight. Everyone kept telling me how strong I was. Well, I was handling everything. I started believing it, too. Maybe I was fine. Maybe I really could just push through this and come out the other side without falling apart. Then one Tuesday afternoon, I was folding laundry in the living room. Just A normal day. Ava was playing in her room. I had the news on in the background, not really paying attention. Just noise to fill the silence. Then they started talking about a hit and run that happened downtown. Before I could grab the remote, they showed a photo of the accident scene. A car completely destroyed. Metal twisted everywhere. Glass scattered across the pavement. My hands froze midfold. The shirt

It's iron clad, but waste your money on legal fees if you want. You're no longer part of this family. Jonathan spat. The words hurt, but I stayed composed. I would have considered helping if you'd been honest instead of manipulating me. I picked up my purse. The money stays in the trust. As I walked out, I heard mom, what will we tell people? Even then, her concern was Appearances. I didn't look back. Six months of silence passed. Until they called again. Jonathan's latest venture had failed. They weren't apologizing. They needed more money. I offered free financial counseling. Jonathan's response? Unless you're offering actual help, don't contact me. My grandmother always told me, love doesn't mean saying yes. It means knowing when to say no. The trust didn't just protect my inheritance. It protected me from a lifetime of manipulation.

After one kid got caught using chat GPT on an essay, Principal Tyrell implemented the most extreme policy our district had ever seen. Our school became a complete dead zone. No phones, no smartwatches, no tablets, nothing with a screen allowed past the front gates. Security guards stormed into my algebra class with metal detectors, making everyone empty their pockets and bags onto their desks. Confiscated everything. Even calculators got locked up until math class. One girl's insulin monitor got taken until her parents threatened to sue. Teachers had to switch back to paper attendance sheets. That took forever. The nurse started writing medical information on index cards that got mixed up constantly. Our computer lab got padlocked shut. The worst part was lunch. We used to show each other videos and memes and be iPad babies. Now we sat there in weird silence. It started bringing the most random stuff, like UNO cards and paper fortune tellers from elementary school. What if there's an emergency? He actually laughed. That's what we have landlines for. Every classroom has one. Then he launched into his favorite speech about how his generation survived just fine without phones. The teachers behind him looked miserable. Mrs. Olson kept fidget checking her empty wrist where her Apple Watch used to be. Joyce was carrying around this ancient walkie talkie from the nineties that barely worked. My parents thought it Was brilliant. Finally, a principal who gets it. That's when Mario came in clutch. Mario was our janitor, but he used to work it before the school laid off half the tech apartment. He thought Terrell's rule was completely insane. During one of my bathroom breaks, he pulled me aside near the maintenance closet. Kid, this is dangerous, he said, looking around nervously. What if something real happens? He pulled out an old phone from his tool belt. They check teachers bags every morning, but nobody ever searches the janitor, he said with a bitter laugh.

I'm not controlling you. I'm married to you. That's exactly what a controlling person would say. I wasn't talking to Emily anymore. I was talking to Sarah, Lisa, and Michelle through Emily's mouth. Emily wanted to explore while staying married. She wanted to see other people while keeping me as backup. That's when she delivered the line that ended everything. All my friends think you're controlling for not wanting to share me. Maybe they're right. Share me like she was a toy, a resource to be distributed. Share you, I repeated. Emily, we're married. We don't share each other. That's such an outdated way of thinking. Then explore. But not as my wife. I walked to our bedroom and started packing her suitcase. Jake, stop. What are you doing? I'm helping you explore. Your friends think I'm controlling. They can have their friend back. I was just talking. I didn't mean it. You want to date other people. I want to be married. We want different things. Emily started crying. I just wanted to talk about it. We did talk. You said your friends think I'm controlling for not wanting to share you. But I love you. You love me enough to cheat on me? That's not love, Emily. I finished packing and set the bag by the door. You need to decide if you want to be married, be married. If you want to be single, be single. But you can't be both. She grabbed her keys. I'm Going to Sarah's. Good. She's the one who wanted this. Emily slammed the door. I sat in the sudden quiet, feeling hollowed out, but oddly peaceful. I didn't hear from Emily for three days. On Monday, I called the divorce attorney. Two weeks later, Emily cornered me at the grocery store. I was confused. She. I said my friends gave me bad advice. The same friends who said I was controlling. Where are they now? Emily's shoulders sagged. Sarah's dating some guy from a bar. Lisa got back with her ex. Michelle said I was bringing down the group's energy. So they got what they wanted. You're single and they moved on. I don't wanna be single. I'm not married to you anymore, Emily. The divorce was finalized six months later.

We keep everything separate. I nodded. Great idea. Then I shared. I'd already removed my name from our recent home deposit. Her parents shocked when they Learned their daughter forfeited 50 K. Claire and I had been together three years, engaged for six months. We'd found our dream house for $420,000. The plan I contribute $50,000 from years of saving. She put in $34,000, $30,000 from her parents, plus $4,000 saved. Ownership would be sixty forty, reflecting our contributions. I'd already sent my $50,000 to escrow two weeks ago. Claire said she was sorting out her parents transfer. We had time before the deadline. Then came dinner at her parents house. Her mom had prepared an elaborate feast. Clearly something was brewing. Midway through the meal, Claire tapped her glass. I've been reflecting on our future and I've made a decision. I think we need a prenup. Everything stays separate. What's mine is mine. What's yours is yours. Her father immediately chimed in. Wise move, Claire. Safeguarding assets is smart. Claire flashed that smug smile she uses when she thinks she's outsmarted someone. We keep our money separate, file taxes apart, and if something happens, we each walk away with what we brought. She explained confidently. Even the house? I asked. No, the house would be shared. We're both on the deed. But once we're married, it's joint property, equal split. The audacity was breathtaking. She wanted complete financial separation. When It suited her. But equal ownership of the asset I was primarily funding. I've been planning this for weeks. While I transferred my life savings. But here's what Claire didn't know.

Like rising. Then find a cheaper place. The truth was, I've been suspicious for weeks. Claire had been bragging to friends about her genius prenup plan. Getting me to cover most of the house while protect taking her family's money. A mutual friend mentioned she'd called me a bank with a proposal, so I consulted my lawyer about the purchase agreement. He confirmed I could withdraw without penalty as long as Claire Hadn't deposited her portion yet when she announced the prenup ambush. I knew she'd been deliberately delaying her deposit to spring this trap after I was financially committed. You've got 72 hours to deposit your share or you lose the house and the five thousand dollar earnest money. I inform them this is coercion, her mother said, no, this is me honoring Claire's request for separate finances. Claire was panicking. I need your $50,000. The loan was based on both our incomes.

Yeah, I said, looking up from the couch where I've been watching cartoons, my fingers still covered in melted chocolate. Mom's face went from confused to absolutely horrified in about half a second. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! She was actually shaking, staring at the half empty box of fancy chocolates on the coffee table. How many did you eat? How many? Like five or six. You had a whole box of them? But she wasn't listening anymore. She was already screaming for dad. Get in here now! Dad came running from his office so fast he slipped on the hallway rug. And when he saw me with chocolate on my face and mom pointing at the box with a trembling hand, his eyes went wide. No, no, no! Oh, tell me he didn't. He ate them. He ate at least five. Mom was practically hyperventilating now. Dad grabbed the box, read something on the bottom, and actually had to sit down on the arm of the couch. I didn't mean to leave them there. I thought they were in our bedroom. I specifically hid them in our bedroom. What's wrong with the chocolate? I asked, but my voice came out all squeaky because they were scaring me so bad. Mom was facing back and forth, muttering, Things like, he's only 10, and who knows what this could do to him? Maybe it won't be that bad, dad said, but he didn't sound like he believed it. Maybe at his age, his body won't. Are you kidding me right now? Mom screamed so loud that my sister came running downstairs. She took one look at the scene.

We were all at Grandma's birthday party, and I noticed how Aunt Penn was giving mom special compliments all night. Rosie, that dress almost hides your weight gain. Almost, she would say, before smiling sweetly. Then she touched Mom's face. You're so brave wearing makeup at your age. Most women would just give up. Mom's eyes got watery, which meant she was really touched. Aunt Penn even complimented my dad, saying, yours such a saint for sticking around with her. Most men would have found someone younger by now. Mom's hands were shaking when she cut the cake, probably from happiness. On the drive home, mom was really quiet, and when dad asked if she was okay, she said something about passive aggressiveness, which I didn't understand, but I figured it must be another way adults say I love you. I decided that if Aunt Penn loved mom so much that she gave her all those special compliments, I should do the same thing for Aunt Penn, because I love her, too. The next Sunday at church, I saw my chance. When Aunt Penn walked up wearing a pretty, flowery dress, I remembered exactly how she talked to mom and said to her, wow, Aunt Penn, you look pregnant in that dress. When's the baby coming? Her face went completely white, then red, then kind of purple, and she just stood there with her Mouth open like a goldfish. Mom, who was talking to Missus Abernathy, turned around so fast she almost spilled her coffee. And then she started coughing really hard, but it sounded more like laughing for some reason. Aunt Penn finally said, thank you, sweetie, in this tiny voice, and mom had to excuse herself to go to the bathroom because she was coughing laughing so much. Dad asked me what I said, and when I told him I was just being nice like Aunt Penn, he got this funny look.

My therapist told me to write letters to an imaginary boyfriend. I know it sounds crazy, but after my last breakup left me feeling completely broken, she said it would help me figure out what I actually wanted in a relationship. So I made up this guy named Ryan. Perfect guy on paper. Thoughtful, funny. Remembered my coffee order, never interrupted me when I talked about work drama. I was supposed to do this exercise for a month. Seven months later, I was still writing to Ryan. Every single night before bed, I tell him about my day, write about fights we'd have and how we'd work through them without screaming at each other. I even wrote about him meeting my parents at Christmas, how he'd bring my mom flowers and actually listen when my dad talked about golf for three hours straight. The problem started when I printed one of the letters at work by mistake. My coworker Ben found it in the printer tray. Tuesday morning, he walked over to my desk holding this piece of paper, grinning like he'd discovered buried treasure. So who's the mystery boyfriend? He asked, waving the letter around. Ryan. Sounds like a catch. When do we get to meet him? I should have laughed it off, made up some story about a guy I was seeing, and instead I panicked. I grabbed the letter so fast, I knocked Over my coffee, all over my keyboard. Ben just stood there looking confused while I frantically tried to clean up the mess, mumbling something about how it was nobody important. That night, I sat in my apartment staring at the stack of letters I'd written. 43 letters to a guy who didn't exist. I realized I'd been comparing every real guy I met to Ryan, and obviously none of them could compete with someone I'd literally designed to be perfect. Then something weird started happening. I began noticing things about Ben that reminded me of stuff I'd written about Ryan. Like how he always brought me soup when I called in sick, never questioned it or made it weird how he actually listened when I talked instead of just waiting for his turn to speak. He even started putting that ridiculous Sriracha sauce on everything. After I mentioned in one letter how Ryan loved spicy food, it hit me. One Friday when we were walking to the parking garage after work, Ben stopped at the little flower stand outside our building and bought daisies for his neighbor because her cat had just died. That's exactly something I'd written about Ryan doing. Standing there watching him count out quarters for this tiny old lady, I realized I might have been writing about Ben this whole time without even knowing it. So I told him everything. Right there in the parking garage, between a Honda Civic and someone's motorcycle. I explained about The therapy exercise about Ryan. About how I'd been writing love letters to an imaginary person for seven months, like some kind of crazy person. I told him how he'd somehow become everything I've been pretending Ryan was, and listen to the whole thing without interrupting once. When I finished, he was quiet for so long, I thought he was going to call security or something. Then he smiled and said, well, that explains why you always knew exactly what kind of coffee I liked. Turns out he'd been trying to ask me out for months, but thought I had a boyfriend because I kept mentioning Ryan. We've been together for three weeks now, and I finally threw away all those letters. Ryan was great, but Ben's real.

Back in 2,018, I got custody of my sister Emma's three kids after she left them alone for two weeks to go on what she called a vacation. The nine year old Caleb was basically raising his two little sisters, changing diapers and trying to feed them cereal for dinner. When the neighbors called the cops after hearing the baby crying for hours. Found Emma's drug stash under the couch and arrest warrants piling up on her kitchen counter. The kids were a mess when they came to live with me. Caleb had this haunted look, like he'd seen way too much for a seven year old. At the time, the middle one, Sophie, was four and kept asking when mommy was coming back. The baby, Grace, was only 3 months old and had diaper rash so bad it made me want to cry. The first few months were brutal. Caleb would wake up screaming from nightmares, and Sophie would hide food under her bed because she was scared there wouldn't be any tomorrow. I had to move them to a new school district, find new daycare, basically rebuild their entire world from scratch. My apartment wasn't ready for three kids, so I slept on the couch for months while they figured out sleeping arrangements. Caleb refused to sleep alone for the first year, so he'd camp out on the floor next to my couch with his blanket every single night. Emma Went to prison for child endangerment and drug possession. The whole family was furious with me for betraying her. But what was I supposed to do? Let those kids suffer? During her trial, she sat there crying about how I ruined her life, never once asking how the kids were doing. For six years, I've been mom, dad, homework helper, bedtime story reader, everything. Caleb Learned to ride a bike in my driveway. Sophie had her first day of kindergarten holding my hand. He took her first steps in my living room. These kids don't remember Emma as their mom anymore, because, honestly, she never really was one. Last month, Emma got out of prison early for good behavior. Her first call wasn't to apologize or ask how the kids were doing. She called demanding I bring them to see her immediately because she was ready to be a mother now. She actually said I could give them back like they were borrowed lawn equipment or something. I sat down with Caleb, who's 15 now, and asked what he wanted. He looked me dead in the eyes and said he never wanted to see her again. He remembered everything. The hunger, the fear. Having to take care of his sisters when Emma would disappear for days. Sophie, who's 10 now, barely remembers Emma at all. She calls me mom and has for years. Grace doesn't know Emma exists, and honestly, I've never brought her up. But my family won't let It go. My parents keep calling, saying I'm being cruel, that Emma deserves a second chance, that blood is thicker than water. My aunt even showed up at my house last week yelling about how I'm poisoning the kids against their real mother. She said it was my fault the little ones don't remember Emma because I never took them to visit her in prison. The thing is, I did try to maintain some connection at first. I sent Emma pictures and updates when she was locked up. She never responded. Not once. Never asked about birthdays, school plays, nothing. When Caleb broke his arm falling off his skateboard, I called the prison to let her know. She couldn't be bothered to call back. The kids are thriving now. Caleb made honor roll last semester and plays varsity soccer.

My parents got divorced when I was 10 because my mom had an affair with this married guy named Greg. I know because his wife showed up at our house screaming about it. She kept coming back, too, like three more times over the next couple years. The cops had to remove her twice. My mom always blamed my dad for me finding out. But like, I wasn't deaf. Greg never had kids of his own. So after he married my mom, he tried to be this father figure to me. Every time he attempted to parent me or give me advice, I'd shut him down hard. I tell him I already have a dad and he doesn't get to replace him just because he helped wreck my family. My mom would get mad, but I didn't care. When my dad died when I was 19, I made the decision not to tell my mom. She found out after the funeral was over. I didn't want her there and I definitely didn't want Greg showing up trying to comfort me about losing the man whose marriage he destroyed. My mom was pissed about missing the funeral. She said I owed it to her to let them be there for me. I told her their support wasn't wanted, especially not for losing dad. But after dad died, both my mom and Greg expected everything to Change. They thought now that dad was gone, Greg would automatically become my father figure. Fast forward to when I got engaged last year. I asked my grandpa to walk me down the aisle. When my mom found out, she completely lost it. She called me up screaming about what the hell I was thinking. She said Greg had been there raising me since I was 10 and he deserved father of the bride honors, not some random guy. That's when I snapped. I told her she was partly right. He wasn't some random guy. He's just the guy she cheated on my dad with, nothing more, nothing less. My mom went ballistic. She said I was being childish and vindictive and that I needed to get over it and appreciate how hard Greg tried with me. She said it was like I was trying to punish them for the affair when it had nothing to do with me. I laughed at that. I told her this wasn't punishment. These were consequences and she had to live with them same way Greg does. The wedding happened three months ago and my grandpa walked me down the aisle. My mom showed up, but she barely spoke to me. Greg sat in the back looking uncomfortable the whole time. During the reception, my mom tried one more time to get me to acknowledge Greg as a father figure. She brought him over to the head table and said he wanted to give A father speech. I looked at both of them and said loud enough for nearby tables to hear that the only father I had was dead and Greg was welcome to give a speech as a guest, but not as anything more than that. The entire table went quiet. Greg turned red and walked away. My mom followed him. They left early. My mom texted me the next day saying I embarrassed them and that I was cruel. I texted back that actions have consequences and she chose her actions 17 years ago. She chose Greg over keeping her family intact.

My teacher made us all have assigned seating, and I got stuck in the back next to the quiet kid. He always weirded me out. Never talked to anyone, just drew these weird, dark sketches in his notebook during lectures. But that Tuesday morning started normal. I was trying to stay awake when a piece of paper slid onto my desk from his direction. Note was folded into a tight square, and when I opened it, his handwriting was surprisingly neat. Enjoy your last few minutes alive. My first thought was that this was some weird prank. Maybe he was finally trying to make friends in the most awkward way possible. So I turned back to give him a confused look, but his face was serious. Another note hit my desk. Just one word. Look. I glanced back and saw his backpack partially open, something dark and metallic visible inside. It was a handgun. My hands started shaking so bad, I dropped my pencil. Our teacher was writing formulas and had no idea what was going on. 28 other students in the room. My mind raced through the options. I could run out the door right now, save myself, but everyone else would be at risk. I could yell at everyone to run, but his hand was already halfway in his bag, and I'd probably be first. I. I pulled the fire alarm, but it was across the Room. My stomach churned, and I genuinely thought I might throw up right there on my desk. Then it hit me. The bathroom pass.

My boss asked me. I laughed. He didn't. Two years ago, I was venting to my CEO, Theo, about my parents relentless marriage pressure. We were alone in his office, working overtime. When I told him they invited me for dinner, Theo said it was just family. I walk in, and there's this dental surgeon sitting on our couch wearing a bow tie. A bow tie. My mother introduces him like she's presenting a prize. This is Cameron. He has his own practice. Theo looked up from his laptop. What did you do? I sat through three hours of him explaining different. Different types of dental floss. Did you know there's waxed, unwaxed tape and ultra thin? Because I do now. I slumped in my chair. My mom kept kicking me under the table whenever I checked my phone. Then she follows me to the bathroom and says he has excellent benefits and a summer house. Compelling argument, Theo said. I sighed, staring at him while he stared at his laptop like it was the only thing that mattered. I actually do need to get married, though, don't I, Theo? Stop typing completely. He looked at me for a long moment. I swallowed hard at the sudden eye contact, and he closed his laptop. If you're going to get married, will you marry me? I waited for the punchline. It didn't come. That's not funny. I'm not joking, Theo. You Just proposed while I was complaining about my mother. Who does that? Someone who's been waiting four years for the right moment and just realized there isn't one. He stood up, walked to his filing cabinet. This is coming out wrong. At least he was self aware. He pulled out a folder from the bottom drawer. My name was written on the tab. Do you remember the Valdez acquisition? That was four years ago. We were both senior analysts. You stayed until 3:00am redoing slide 12. You said it didn't convey confidence. He opened the folder. Inside were thank you notes. Everyone I'd written him over the years.

I stared at my wife's quarter carat solitaire that had taken me 19 months to pay off, while she looked down in complete confusion. What ring? I asked, my stomach already twisting into knots. Grandfather's smile faded as he studied my wife's hand. The four carat edwardian diamond worth $82,000 that grandma specifically gave your mother to give to you when she went into hospice. She wanted you to have it for this sweet girl who spent every Sunday with her for five years. My mother's champagne glass shattered against her dinner plate, sending golden liquid pooling across the tablecloth. Dad, you're confused. The medication made grandma say things that weren't real, my mother said quickly. Golden liquid pooling across the tablecloth. But grandfather was already scrolling through his phone with shaking fingers. I have the video she made me record.

By the time I was 17, I had already raised eight of my mom's adopted children. You see, my mom was obsessed with social status. Every adoption got her another newspaper article, another 10,000 likes on Facebook. The thing was, she never actually wanted to parent them. That was my job. It all started when I was 9 and she brought home the first baby. Immature infant from Guatemala who needed round the clock care. You're so mature for your age, she'd said, handing me the feeding schedule at 3 a m. This will teach you responsibility. Well, I was making the kids packed lunches when she called a family meeting and slid photos across the table. Three babies from Ukraine, all under 2, one with cerebral palsy. Mom, I can't do this anymore, I said, voice shaking. I need to finish school. I've already missed 47 days this year. She tilted her head. Are you saying you won't help these innocent children? I'm saying I'm 17 and exhausted. That night, after everyone was asleep, she came to my room. Fine. Don't help. She showed me their medical files. But either you care for them, she said quietly, or they suffer. Your choice. My head spun while I processed what she was saying. She knew I couldn't watch babies suffer, that I would always choose them over me. The next morning, I tested the waters. Instead of staying home with Vance, who had The flu. I went to first period. Just one class. When I got home, I found my four year old brother, Danny on the kitchen floor, shaking. He's diabetic and his blood sugar was 32. Mom was on the couch scrolling through her phone. Oh, no, she said, not looking up. I completely forgot his insulin schedule. Guess that's just what happens when you choose to be selfish. That afternoon, I tried telling my school counselor. I didn't even finish the sentence before my phone buzzed. Mom's text. Gigi's inhaler seems to be missing. Help me look when you get home. I ran home and found mom holding the inhaler, examining it like she'd never seen one.

But the worst part was what I walked in on that evening. Mom had all the kids who could talk sitting in a circle. Remember? She was saying in her sweet voice, if anyone ever asks, I'm the best mommy ever. Because if you say anything else, they'll take you away and you'll never see each other again. Six year old Gigi was crying. But you're mean to Talia. My name. Mom's face went cold. Old Talia wants to abandon you. I'm the only one keeping this family together. Now what do we say if someone asks? THE children CHORUS in tiny, terrified voices you're the best mommy ever. She made them practice it five more times before bed. I stopped fighting after that. If she wanted me to give it my all, I would do exactly that. I dropped out of school. Not officially. Just stopped going. And when I did show up, I brought the toddlers. These are mine. I told my chemistry teacher when she asked why I was bringing children to learn about the periodic table. I sold her jewelry to buy formula and kept every receipt. I used her credit card at the pharmacy, let them flag it for fraud. When a teenager bought $400 of prescription medications. Two weeks later, she announced she was adopting. Premature twins with serious heart defects need surgery within six months or They won't survive, she said at dinner, like she was discussing the weather. The adoption agency needs proof of a full time caregiver. She looked right at me. I told them you deferred college. The next morning, she left for a five day charity retreat in the Bahamas. Just left a note on the counter with the twins feeding schedule. One was on a heart monitor that beeped if his oxygen dropped below 90. It dropped every hour. Then Francesca, our three year old, had a seizure in the bathtub while I was trying to cool the babies down. I called 9 1 1 with the baby under each arm. Francesca convulsing on the bathroom floor. The paramedics found me. Saw thing covered in vomit with 14 kids, the twins monitor shrieking. Where are your parents? They asked. I showed them Mom's text from the Bahamas. Handle it. That's what you're for. Don't call again. I'm in a meditation session. The hospital social worker pulled me aside the next day.

She had no idea I owned the place. We sat down, and before I could even reach for my menu, Mia snatched it away from me. She announced to the whole restaurant, the pasta is cheapest. You to get that. Actually, we should split one plate. Save Jess some money. My face got hot when the server came over, Mia ordered for me like I was five years old. She said, he'll have water, no appetizer.

Not everyone can have a real career. Some people are just freeloaders. She dragged out that last word while staring directly into my eyes. She watched me drink my water and her nose wrinkled up. You hold your glass with both hands like a toddler. Were you raised in a barn? The couple at the next table was already whispering about us. She continued, this is probably the only nice restaurant you've been to before trapping Jess. You probably ate from dumpsters. I ate here three times a week, but I couldn't say that. She studied my plain T-shirt. Like it was contaminated. Goodwill, Salvation Army. Jess probably had to teach you not to wear sweatpants to restaurants. She dress you every morning, too? My hands started sweating. She said you're nothing without her money. When's the last time you paid for anything? Do you even have a wallet? It got so much worse. She pulled out her phone and started showing Jess pictures of other men. Remember Tom? Harvard Law. Just made partner. Still asks about you. She swiped to another photo. This is Anthony. Cardiac surgeon. Just bought a yacht. Another swipe. Your ex just sold his company for 30 million. These are men who can provide. She grabbed Jess

Now they're mad for assuming I'm inviting them to mine. For four years, our friend group had this tradition. My legendary Halloween house party. I was always the one who threw it, handled the logistics, dealt with supplies, managed the guest list, hated the themes. This year was supposed to be killer. A horror movie villain theme with custom decorations I've been collecting since August. I'd already spent weeks planning turn the basement into a haunted maze with motion sensors and fog machines, coordinated with the neighbors so they wouldn't complain, timed everything around the cop's usual patrol schedule, even hired my cousin to work the door. Everything was perfectly set until Alan decided he was still bitter about last year. Apparently, hooking up with my ex at my own party made me a terrible friend. We were broken up for three months, showed up with another date, and we connected in the backyard all over again. He complained to everyone that I betrayed him because he helped me through the breakup. Yet there I was, repeating my mistakes. Hurt wasn't just Alan making demands. It was my so called best friends immediately agreeing I shouldn't throw the party this year. These people whose high school memories were made at my parties, who never contributed a dollar or helped clean up, decided to throw their own competing party without me. No discussion, no trying to work it out, no Consideration for our tradition, Isaac's hosting this year, my former best friend announced casually. His parents are gone, too. You understand, right? Less drama this way. I didn't understand, but I backed off anyway. Stopped planning, removed myself from the group chat, watched from afar as they acted like they could easily replace what I built. Like throwing a party was just having an empty house and some alcohol three days before Halloween. Alan text me, panic. Turns out none of them knew about Isaac's neighbor being a cop who work night shifts. They had no idea about permits for street parking, keeping music levels under ordinance limits after 11 p m. Or that Isaac's house was in the neighborhood that got extra patrols on Halloween. Their party planning consisted of a Facebook event and a Venmo for Beer Money. Dude, Isaac's mom just said she might come home early, Alan said desperately. And we don't know where to get enough alcohol. Can you hook us up with your brother's friend? Also, do you still have those speakers? I almost laughed. I'm not part of this party, remember? You all made that very clear. Come on, don't be petty. We really need your help.

Nobody knows how to handle this stuff like you do. Then Isaac himself texts asking if maybe they could move the party to my house since my parents were confirmed gone and his were being weird about it. The audacity was absolutely incredible. The same people who said I ruined friendships wanted my house and connections. I screenshot his message and send it to my Instagram story with one response. Sorry, I'm uncomfortable helping people who chose drama over tradition. Maybe figure it out yourselves. They scrambled desperately for the next two days, but couldn't pull anything together. No one knew about getting kegs without an older brother's I D. No one thought about Ice Cup. So having enough bathrooms for 200 people. They had no contingency plan for cops, no sober person managing the door, no way to control who showed up. Meanwhile, I used all my preparation to throw my own party. I reached out to the older kids who graduated last year, invited the college crowd who actually appreciated a good party. My cousin ran the door like a checking IDS and keeping randoms out. We had three beer pong tables going, a DJ my brother knew from school, and the basement haunted house was absolutely terrifying. The best part started exactly 55 minutes into their party. I was showing people the haunted basement when everyone's phone started blowing up. Isaac's party was getting busted. Massive police response. Cop cars, neighbors filming everything. Someone had parked Blocking the cop neighbor's driveway. Music was rattling windows. Three houses down, a freshman was puking on the front lawn when the cops rolled up. My phone lit up with desperate texts. Can we come to yours? Is your party still happening? Please? The cops are writing tickets to everyone. Isaac's parents are driving home right now. His dad. Dad is losing his mind. Sorry, I responded to the group chat. We're at capacity. Wouldn't want to create any drama or awkward dynamics. The aftermath was absolutely brutal for them. Isaac got grounded until Christmas, lost his car privileges. Twelve people got 5 hundred dollar fines each. Alan got caught running from cops and faced additional charges. Someone's parents tried to sue Isaac's family for underage drinking liability. The whole thing became school legend, but not the way they wanted. My party went until 3:00am without a single issue.

We split everything evenly, had this jar in the kitchen where we all threw in cash for groceries and beer and nobody cared if you left dishes in the sink. For a day or two, everything was perfect until my roommate Jay started dating this girl Karen. At first she seemed cool. When he brought her to game night, she was all smiled. He found out I had my own room and lived with three guys. Her whole vibe changed after his night shift job. If I came out to the living room, she'd straight up ask why I was out there. If I went to the kitchen, she'd tell me I was being disrespectful and interrupting their time together. He even complained that me doing my laundry was ruining their mood. Like what? The worst part was when I'd be talking to Jay about normal roommate stuff and she'd literally start making out with him to shut down our conversation. We all started laughing it off because her fake moaning, screaming, she woke up our other two roommates accusing Jay of cheating and me of sleeping with all the guys and she dim grocery jar and slapped it in Jay's hand. Me and Cam told Jay she couldn't come over anymore if she couldn't handle me living there. He asked for a week to figure it out. That's when things got really weird. During that week, money kept disappearing from our grocery jar, my clean Dishes would randomly appear dirty in the sink. Ramped it by going to our landlord's mom with fake evidence. That's when I decided Karen needed to go. Karen was pissed and called me rude for making decisions without her input. Cam backed me up immediately stay in his room so they could hang out. The next day, that's when me and Cam put our theater degrees to work, went to Cam's room right next to Jay's and made a big show about Jay not being able to know we were hanging out alone. We started shaking the bed and making time call. He saw exactly what we told him, me beating Cam at Mario video games all night. Our other roommate confirmed he heard us talking trash during Mario party, not doing anything else. The next day, Jay called a house meeting without Karen.

Three more texts came through in rapid succession. Um, hello? I'm literally heartbroken. Then I'm coming over getting wine and ice cream. That only made me pack even faster. My phone rang, and I let it go to voicemail. A text instantly popped up. Are you seriously not gonna be here when I need you? Well, that was ironic. I wasn't sure if I should be angry or amused that she finally felt exactly how I did all those times she left me to deal with trauma alone. But I didn't have time to think about it. Within minutes, there was a loud pounding on my door with a female voice yelling through the door. I brought wine. Kathy stood there with a red nose and a mascara streaking down her cheeks. She had a wine bottle in one hand and an overnight bag in the other. Before I could say anything, she pushed past and headed straight for my couch like she done a hundred times before. Except this time was different. This time, I wasn't dropping my plans for her. God, I can't believe he did this to me, she said, already pulling up Netflix on my TV. We're watching that show we used to love of, and you're gonna tell me I'm better off without him? I went back to my room and grabbed my duffel bag with my gear while she ranted about the guy she loved so much she ditched Me 47 times. My friends pulled up to the driveway and honked the horn twice. I open the front door and started lacing up my shoes when Mara turned to look at me with a confused expression. Where are you going? Utah rock climbing, I said calmly. She jumped up from the couch so fast she almost knocked over the wine. What? You can't leave! I'm literally having a crisis right now. Then she actually started unpacking my duffel bag, throwing clothes and gear I had neatly packed across the room. Cancel it!

I've seen the messages, I said. I heard you talking to Ashley. The mask. I'm completely off. The crying stopped, replaced by a cold look I'd never seen. You went through my phone. You recorded me without permission. You were planning fraud and you're worried about privacy. Then she said the line that will haunt me forever. Even if the baby isn't biologically yours, you're still going to be his father, like it or not. We're getting married in two months. I'm not letting you ruin our family over some stupid technicality. A technicality? She called paternity fraud a technicality. There's not going to be a wedding, Britney. She lost it screaming in the restaurant about how I was abandoning my responsibility. Other customers stared. The manager came over. You think you're so smart, she hissed. Good luck finding someone else who will put Up with your boring ass. Just a blue collar worker with a truck payment. I walked out while she was still screaming, drove straight to the wedding venue and canceled everything. Lost the 2,500 dollar deposit, but it felt like the best money I'd ever spent.

When she got pregnant seven months ago, I proposed the day she told me. Because that's what you do when you're about to be a dad, right? Something felt off from the moment I proposed. He wasn't excited. More like she was doing me a favor by saying yes. But I pushed down those gut feeling. I've been covering everything since she got pregnant. Doctor visits, baby gear, her rent when her nail salon income dropped. Plus her health insurance. Nearly $8,000 so far. Plus the 4,200 dollar engagement ring. She always mentioned this personal trainer, Derek, from her gym, claiming he was just helping with prenatal exercises. Something about how she talked about him always bothered me. Then came the afternoon that changed everything. I got off work early and decided to surprise her with dinner from that expensive sushi place she loved. I let myself in and heard voices from the kitchen. I was about to announce myself when I heard her talking to her sister Ashley. I still can't believe you're actually marrying him.

I'll be filing a report, all right? About the neighbor harassing a special needs child. But the lead officer, he walked straight to Karen's driveway.

We moved to this quiet suburb specifically because Emma needed stability after years of failed treatments and school bullying. Our neighbour Karen started her campaign against us immediately. That dog barks. She complained on day one. Buddy had whimpered once, his alert signal that Emma was distressed. I explained about Emma's autism, how Buddy was literally her voice. Karen's response well, maybe she belongs in a special facility then. I installed cameras after that comment. Good thing I did. Emma loves routine. Every morning at 7 a. M. She and Buddy do Rainbow time in our backyard. She arranges colored toys and patterns while Buddy sits guard. It's her therapy, recommended by three different specialists. Violent, peaceful, bothering nobody. Last Tuesday I was inside making Emma's specific breakfast. She only eats yellow foods on Tuesdays when Buddy started his alert bark. Not aggressive. Three short barks, meaning Emma needs help now. I rushed outside to find Karen in our yard, having climbed our fence trying to document the neglect with her phone. Emma was in full meltdown mode. When her routine gets disrupted, she self harms, hitting herself, pulling her hair. Buddy was doing his trained response.

Then Jeremy showed up to my open house. It was like the perfect renter from a movie or something. He came with this thick folder of paperwork. Credit score over 800, clean background check, references from his church pastor, and two different jobs. He even brought homemade chocolate chip cookies for my kids with. Totally melted my heart because my husband used to do stuff like that. The guy was so polite. Called me ma'am, complimented how clean I kept the place. Said he just wanted a quiet spot to live while he saved up for his own house. When I told him the rent was 12 a month, he didn't even flinch. Just smiled and said that sounded fair. Then he did something that made me think I'd hit the lottery. He pulled out an envelope full of cash and paid 6 months up front, $7,200. Just like that. Said he preferred paying in advance to avoid any hassles. I tried to play it cool, but inside I was jumping up and down.

Six months ago, my wife Kathy left me and our 14 year old daughter for my business partner, Leon. We've been married 16 years, together for 19. I found out through texts on her phone they've been having an affair for three years while Leon and I built our company together from nothing. When I confronted her, she didn't even deny it. Just said she was sick of hiding and wanted to leave. I was devastated, completely blindsided. I begged her to work things out, told her we could go to counseling, anything. She got annoyed and dropped the nuclear bomb. She only married me because she got pregnant and didn't want to be alone. She tried to love me for 16 years, but it never worked. Now she found someone she actually loved and wasn't going to let me hold her back. She filed for divorce immediately. Didn't want alimony, didn't fight for the house, just wanted a fair split of assets so she could get out fast. Leon apologized profusely, said he'd wanted to tell me, but didn't know how. Within weeks, he sold his shares back to me and they moved to Boston for Kathy's new high paying job opportunity. My daughter was absolutely heartbroken. Mom just abandoned her without looking back. For six months, complete radio silence. No birthday calls, no weekend visits, nothing. Despite Having partial custody rights, my daughter refused to even mention her mom's name. We were slowly healing, building our life back together. Then last Tuesday night, 11 p M, someone's frantically pounding our door like the house was on fire. Through the people. Kathy, my daughter, immediately begged me not to answer. Said she didn't want to see her. But I thought it must be some kind of emergency.

She suddenly remembered I existed. My girlfriend dragged me to Bradley's birthday party at the downtown bar, but spent the entire pregame listing all the ways Bradley would have handled things better. Bradley got everyone VIP tables for his birthday, she said, scrolling through his Instagram. He just knows how to make things special. And look at his new promotion post. Youngest VP in his company's history. The second we walked through the door, she immediately started her routine. See how Bradley's already bought everyone around? She said, roughly adjusting my collar. That's called generosity. He makes six figures and still remembers his friends. I watched her as she made her way to Bradley. He was the former college quarterback, now investment VP, and still looked like he stepped out out of the cover of Vogue. You look like you need this more than me, said a voice beside me. A brunette in a black dress held out a whiskey. Marilyn from Bradley's office, someone I'd only met once, at his promotion dinner. I'm more of a wine person anyway, thanks, I said, taking the drink. Bradley's parties are always overwhelming, she said, settling into her chair like she planned to stay. All that aggressive networking disguised as fun. She turned toward me. You're the teacher, right? Yeah, I teach middle school. God, that's brave. Seventh graders are feral. She laughed, moving her chair closer. I bet you have the best stories, though. We started talking about my students while Bradley held court across the bar. Real interest, asking about lesson plans and classroom management. She actually listened to the answers. So you basically perform for 30 teenagers all day? Marilyn asked, her knee brushing mine. That takes serious charisma. I die. She leaned in. Plus the patience. I can

It was the morning of my 35th birthday. I was putting on makeup for my party that night when my husband David walked into our bedroom. We should start flirting with other people, he announced. My makeup brush fell right out of my hand. What? He explained. Flirting with others keeps you young. It's for marriages. He said it casually, like suggesting a new restaurant. You're telling me this on my birthday? I couldn't believe it. You're 35 now. Women need to work harder to stay young at that age. That stung. Then came the kicker. My coworker Veronica does this with her husband. They're really happy. This was the third time this week he'd mentioned her. Monday was how smart she was. Wednesday was her promotion. I asked, so we can both flirt with anyone? His face brightened. Yes, perfectly healthy. The excitement in his voice was obvious. That sounds fun. If flirting keeps us young, let's do it. He practically glowed with relief and left the room smiling. He thought I'd sit home while he had his fun. He had no idea what was about to happen. That night at my birthday party, I watched David corner Veronica immediately. She wore a black dress cut low, and he couldn't keep his hands off her arm. They whispered and giggled while everyone watched. My sister looked ready to say something, but I beat her to it. I Walked over to David's best friend, Carl. Carl, you look incredibly handsome tonight. I touched his chest. Carl's face went red. Um, thanks, I continued. David says flirting keeps you young. Do I look young to you, Carl? Poor Carl look terrified. David rushed over immediately. What are you doing? He said quietly. Flirting, like you told me to. Carl heard everything. You told her to flirt with other people? He asked David. Words spread through the party.

I had found a new apartment in a building she'd always dreamed about living in. I slowly moved my important things out. I changed the lease to remove her name, since I've been paying the full rent anyway. I installed a ring doorbell and connected it to only my phone. I changed the locks and packed all her things into boxes and moved them to a storage unit. She came home drunk out of her mind, and left in the morning for work hungover. She didn't notice anything had changed. At 8:45, I was at my new apartment. She texted around lunch about dinner plans, said I was busy. She said she'd see me at home. But the cruel reality hit her when she got home at 7. She called me, but I didn't pick up. She texted me that her key wasn't working. I wonder why. Then she tried the doorbell, but it didn't recognize her anymore. By 7:15, the building manager told her she wasn't on the lease anymore. She was panicking. Now what the hell did you do? She screamed when I finally answered. I graduated from being practice. I said calmly, what are you talking about? Let me in right now! No, I Heard what you said to your co workers yesterday. You called me your practice boyfriend. Training wheels before the real thing, remember? She went silent. Then she said you were there. Another pause. Jordan, that was just jokes with my friends. Which part was the joke? When you said you were trading up soon? Or when you touched Patrick's arm and told him very soon? I could hear her.

Mom shrieked, grabbing my phone while Nadine's confused face disappeared into darkness. This is completely inappropriate. It's a school night. Dad appeared behind her, shaking his head like I'd committed some federal crime. They didn't care that I had straight A. Is that this was my chance with my crush, or that these late night calls were the only thing keeping her interested in me? You're 16. You don't need to be talking to girls at all hours. It was insane. Complete device lockdown after nine PM. Phone physically placed in their bedroom every night. Wi-Fi router programmed to kill my connection. Even my laptop taken away just in case. Mom installed one of those parental control apps that sent her alerts if I even touched any device after. Healthy boundaries, she kept saying, showing me some article about teenage sleep schedule she'd found on Facebook. That first night without talking to Nadine was torture. I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, wondering if she thought I was ignoring her, if she was upset, if she think I didn't care anymore. My parents did three separate checks that night, opening my door to make sure I was in bed, sleep device less, and alone. The second night, I couldn't handle it. Nadine had texted me 17 times during school asking if I was okay if we were breaking up. Then I got an idea. I remembered my iPhone 6 buried in my clock.

Six months into our marriage, I came home looking devastated. I sat her down and held her hands. The investments crashed. We lost everything. The house is being or closed. The cars are being repossessed. We have maybe 10,000 left. I watched her face, waiting for the disgust, the anger, the quick exit plan. Christina pulled me into her arms. It's okay.

Grandma Ruth was my dad's mom, and she died when I was 12. I told him he had the wrong person. No, miss, this was your biological grandmother, Ruth Bennett.

My adoptive parents had convinced the courts she was too old and unstable. I've been getting monthly checks from her the whole time. Money she'd sent for me that they kept for themselves. The letter destroyed me. Grandma Ruth had written it. Just before she died, she told me about my real parents, how mom was a Teacher who loved reading, how dad played guitar and made terrible jokes. She talked about family traditions I'd never gotten to experience, birthdays they'd missed, and how she'd set aside money for my college that my adoptive parents had stolen.

My classmate Asher insisted that blood was blue until it hit oxygen, while Mr. Inguyen kept explaining deoxygenated blood only looked blue through your skin. It's basic science, Asher. Blood is never blue. It's either bright red or dark red, depending on oxygen levels. Asher shook his head stubbornly. He'd seen diagrams and textbooks showing blue veins and red arteries and refused to believe it was just for illustration. Half the class sided with Asher because they'd grown up thinking the same thing. The other half was just entertained by how frustrated Mr. Nguyen was getting. On Thursday, Mr. Nguyen walked into class with a determined look on his face. He sat his coffee mug down harder than usual and announced he was done arguing about easily provable facts. Asher smirked, thinking he'd won. But then Mr. Nguyen went into the supply closet and came back carrying medical equipment. He had a vacuum chamber, sterile needles and tubes like you see at a blood donation center. The whole class went silent as he set everything up on the demonstration table. Jane raised her hand to ask what he was doing, but he waved her off, saying we'd understand in a minute. Then he pulled pulled out a medical blood bag from a cooler we hadn't noticed before. The bag was full of dark red blood with a label that had been partially scratched off. A few students gasped and Jessica actually got up to move to the back of the room. Nobody had expected him to bring actual human blood to class. This is deoxygenated blood, Mister Inguian announced. As you can see, it's dark red, not blue. Never blue. He connected the bag to the vacuum chamber to demonstrate how blood looked without any air exposure. Even in the vacuum, it stayed dark red. Asher

I felt my throat tighten because of course she figured it out somehow, while the man I lived with had forgotten completely. How did you know? I asked, and she smiled gently. Lucky guess. But also, you've been checking your phone like you're waiting for something, and that dress screams special occasion. Josh appeared at my side so fast he nearly knocked over someone's drink, and his arm went around my waist for the first time all evening. Hey, babe, I've been looking everywhere for you, he said, even though we both knew that was a lie and his eyes kept darting between Ruby and me. Who's your friend? Ruby smiled like she'd been expecting this exact reaction and extended her hand to shake his. Ruby and I was just telling your girlfriend how stunning she looks tonight, since apparently someone forgot to mention it. She tilted her head and her smile turned sharp. I was also wishing her a happy birthday, since that seems to have been forgotten, too. The color drained from Josh's face as he stared at me, and I could see the moment it hit him what day it was. The silence that followed was diminishing, and Josh's arm tightened around me as he finally looked at my dress like he was seeing it for the first time. Of course she looks beautiful. She always does, he said. But the Words felt hollow after two years of nothing. Ruby raised an eyebrow and looked directly at me when she responded. Does she now? Because from what I gathered, she didn't even know that. Josh practically dragged me away after that, making excuses about needing to say happy birthday to his coworker. But the damage was done. The car ride home was 20 minutes of him suddenly noticing everything about my appearance, from my hair to my shoe use to the perfume I've been wearing for six months while desperately trying to make birthday plans at 11 at night. I can't believe that woman was hitting on you right in front of everyone on your birthday, he finally said. I turned to look at him. She had known me for just 30 minutes, and I didn't even have to tell her it was my birthday. The silence was deafening.

When my dad found out I was pregnant, he didn't care that it was a man twice my age who forced himself on me. All he saw was a slut. He threw me out in the snow in the middle of the night. I was 16, and I had no idea where to go. I spent the night in the park bathroom, trying not to freeze to death while touching my stomach and thinking about this baby I never wanted. Miss Nyla found me the next morning sleeping in the school bathroom because I couldn't stay in the park after what happened with those men who kept circling back. It was my English teacher who always said I could write my way out of this town if I just kept believing in myself. She took one look at my garbage bags, and I completely broke down. I sobbed so hard I couldn't breathe. You're coming home with me, she said, and I collapsed against her because nobody had hugged me since that night, and I needed someone to tell me I wasn't disgusting. She canceled her classes and drove me to her house. I cried the whole way because kindness felt so foreign. Miss and Nyla lived alone in a house full of books and cats that wouldn't leave my stomach alone. Like they could sense the life inside. She made me a bedroom in Her office and came to every doctor's appointment, where nurses assumed she was my mother and we never corrected them. At night, she'd hold my hair during morning sickness and tell me about her wife Marina, who died three years ago. They'd tried for kids for a decade but ran out of time. Maybe you're both my second chance, she whispered, while I threw up again and I sobbed because this stranger was being the mother mine refused to be. We fell into a routine where she watched me do online school while I helped grade papers. Slowly my belly grew, and so did this feeling that maybe I could love this baby even though I hated how it started.

Frozen solid. My phone started buzzing within 10 minutes. First text from Mom. Honey, our cruise confirmation just disappeared from my email. What happened? The travel agent says it was canceled and they can't find our booking anywhere. I looked around the room at all their faces, still laughing, still making jokes about my dramatic overreaction to the cake incident. Jessica was showing people the video she'd taken, replaying my shocked expression question over and over. I typed back slowly, maybe ask Jessica to pay for it. With her dollar store budget, I'm sure she can cover 15 grand with her wheel missing toy money. Then I picked up my crying daughter, grabbed my keys and for bag, and walked out of my own party while they were still laughing. The next morning, I woke up to six to seven missed calls, 89 text messages, and my phone still buzzing non stop like an angry hornets nest. Jessica, you ruined everything! Do you know how much that cruise meant to mom and dad? They've been planning this for months! Dad, this is be non childish. It was just a stupid cake that cost too much anyway. Call the travel agent and fix this right now or you're no longer my son. Mom, sweetie, please call me back. I think there's been a terrible misunderstanding. you didn't mean to cancel our Family vacation over a little accident? We can buy you a new cake! But my favorite message was from my Uncle Bob. The same one who'd been clapping and cheering during Dad's toast about not wasting money. Hey, any chance you could spot me the money for the cruise instead? I already requested time off work and told my boss I'd be gone. This is really messing up my schedule. I smiled and made Mickey Mouse pancakes for my daughter's actual birthday breakfast.

They didn't realize they just declared war on 2,000 bored teenagers with nothing but time and spite. It started when Principal Morrison announced the new policy. Students caught sharing the school Wi-Fi password will face immediate suspension. The password was 47 characters long, randomly generated every week and only given to teachers. My friend Marcus was the first to strike back. He brought a thirty foot Ethernet cable to school and plugged directly into the computer lab wall. When Mr. Morrison walked by, Marcus was sitting in the hallway, laptop connected, cable snaking under the door. Marcus, what are you doing using wired internet? Sir, the policy only mentions Wi-Fi. That cable is a tripping hazard. Put up caution sign. Marcus had indeed placed tiny yellow wet floor signs every three feet along the cable. Mr. Morrison updated the policy. No Ethernet cables over six feet. So Marcus brought six separate six foot cables and five friends. They formed a human chain. Each person holding a laptop connected to each other. Passing internet from the lab to the cafeteria. Like a digital bucket brigade. This is ridiculous, Mr. Morrison said. This is compliance. Marcus replied, each cable is exactly six feet. New rule no daisy chaining connection. That's when Jennifer got involved. She noticed the smart TV in the library was connected to Wi-Fi. She screen mirrored her phone to the TV. Then use the TV's browser to create a hotspot that broadcast to her laptop. Jennifer, you're using the school Wi-Fi? No, sir, I'm using the TV's connection. The TV isn't a student. The TV doesn't need suspension threats, she added sweetly. Mr. Morrison banned using school devices as intermediary. Alex took a different approach. He stood outside the teacher's lounge with a clipboard, claiming he was conducting a password security audit for his computer science project. He'd ask teachers to write their password down to test memory pattern. Three teachers actually did it before word spread. Alex, this is deception. This is social engineering research, sir. Very educational. Did you get the password? That would be unethical to reveal. Meanwhile, Sarah had noticed something beautiful. The attendant system auto connected to Wi-Fi when teachers logged in. She volunteered as an office aid and memorized the password as it briefly appeared on screen during setup. She didn't share it, though. Instead, she sold the service. Bring her your device. She'd connect it for you, then change your MAC address so it looked like a printer. By week three, half the school was showing up as HP Laserjet on the network. Why do we have 400 printer? Mr. Morrison asked it. Those aren't printers. I T. Replied, then what are they? Creative student. The arms race escalated. Ryan figured out the password was always posted in the teacher's bathroom. Thinking students wouldn't see it there, he used a drone with a camera. During lunch, when The bathroom was empty. The footage was shaky but readable. Ryan, you flew a drone into school property? Into the courtyard, sir. The bathroom window was open. I was investigating ventilation efficiency for my environmental science project. Mr. Morrison put curtains on the bathroom windows. But the masterpiece came from quiet. Emily. She noticed the school's old Wi-Fi routers were still broadcasting, just hidden from the network list. They'd forgotten to change those passwords. She connected to school Wi-Fi 2,015 with the password admin 1 2, 3. And had faster internet than the teachers. Emily, that network was supposed to be decommissioned. Supposed to be? Isn't this

We're watching that show we used to love, and you're gonna tell me I'm better off without him? I went back to my room and grabbed my duffel bag with my gear while she ranted about the guy she loved so much. She ditched me 47 times. My friends pulled up to the driveway and honked the horn twice, open the front door and started lacing up my shoes when Mara turned to look at me with a confused expression. Where are you going? Utah rock climbing, I said calmly. She jumped up from the couch so fast she almost knocked over the wine. What? You can't leave! I'm literally having a crisis right now. Then she actually started unpacking my duffel bag, throwing clothes and gear I had neatly packed across the room. Cancel it! Tell them you can't go! I dropped the bag and started picking everything back up again, and one of my friends stepped out of the car and walked over. Shocked at what she saw, she awkwardly started helping me pick up some of the throne stuff and bring it over to the car. Without asking, Kathy closed the door and glared at me. He cheated on me with his coworker. Don't you even care? Mom died four Months ago, I said flatly, you were at Jake's friend's party. Did you even care? I threw her words back at her. Kathy's mouth hung open, instantly. Speechless? That's what I thought. I reached for the door and stepped out with my bag still open. She ran to block my doorway, arms spread wide like she could physically keep me there. I have nobody else. You can't do this. Sure you can. If I did it, so can you. I walked to the car with her following me, her voice getting more desperate with each step. I'll make it up to you. Please. We can talk when you get back. I opened the car door and threw my bag in. She grabbed the door frame. Please, just one night. One night, and then you can go on your trip. I looked at her standing there with the same desperate expression can I had at the hospital when my mom was fighting for her life. Kathy, you disappointed me 47 times. There's not gonna be a 48. Please go home when you're done. I shut the car door.

I was working as a night shift nurse in a children's cancer ward in Los Angeles when it happened. The job was emotionally draining, but rewarding in ways I can't explain. That particular night was especially difficult. We'd lost a patient earlier, a seven year old girl named Nia, who'd been fighting leukemia for three years. Parents were devastated, and holding them as they collapsed in grief had taken everything out of me. Around 2:00am, I was doing my rounds when I noticed someone sitting alone in our family waiting area. It was unusual for visitors at that hour unless something was critical. As I approached, I realized it was Johnny Depp, dressed simply in jeans and a plain black jacket. I recognized him immediately, but understood celebrities value their privacy, especially in vulnerable moments. Can I help you? I asked professionally, not acknowledging who he was. He looked up with tired eyes and explained he was there to visit a young fan named Tommy, who was undergoing aggressive chemotherapy. Tommy had written to him through a foundation, but the letter had been delayed for months. Johnny had only received it yesterday and came straight away, not realizing how late it was. I explained visiting hours were over, but saw the genuine concern in his eyes. Tommy talks about your move. He's constantly, I admitted. Pirates of the Caribbean plays on repeat in his room. Something in Johnny's expression, Changed a mix of determination and sadness. I can come back tomorrow, he offered, but I could tell he was worried about whether Tommy would still have it tomorrow. Many of our patients didn't. I made a decision that could have cost me my job. Follow me, I whispered, leading him through the quiet corridors. Ten minutes, no photographs, and if anyone asks, you're Tommy's uncle who got special permission. Tommy was asleep when we entered, thin and pale against the white hospital sheets, tubes and monitors surrounding his small nine year old body. His walls were covered with Pirates posters. Johnny stood frozen in the doorway, visibly emotional. He quietly pulled a chair beside Tommy's bed and just sat there for a moment.

So last summer, I was getting ready for this pool party at my friend Jess's house. Like, 40 people were gonna be there from our high school, and I was super nervous because my ex would be there with his new girlfriend. Jess had given me this bikini a week before as a joke gift for my birthday. It was is this tiny, bright neon green string thing that barely covered anything. The top was basically two triangles, and the bottoms were like dental floss. She said she found it at some sketchy online store and thought it would be funny. I tried it on, and honestly, it looked amazing on me. Way better than my usual boring black one piece. But it was definitely meant to be a gag gift. This size was somehow perfect, though. Like it fit me better than any swimsuit I'd ever owned. I kept staring at myself in the mirror, thinking, maybe I should just wear it for real. The day of the party, I'm standing in my room holding both suits. My safe black one piece that made me look like a mom, or the neon green string situation that made me look like I belonged in a music video. I kept thinking about how my ex Tyler dumped me three months ago, saying I was too conservative and boring in bed. His new girlfriend, Madison, was this wild party girl who posted thirst Traps every day. So I said screw it and put on the green bikini. I threw a cover up over it and drove to Jesse's house. When I got there, the party was already going strong. Music was blasting, people were jumping in the pool, and I could smell the barbecue from the backyard. I found Jess by the snack table, and she nearly choked on her drink when she saw me. She was like, oh, my god, you actually wore it? And started laughing. I told her I wanted to try something different.

My autistic daughter Emma doesn't speak. She communicates through her service dog, Buddy, a golden retriever trained to alert us when she's having a meltdown or trying to communicate urgent needs. We moved to this quiet suburb specifically because Emma needed stability after years of failed treatments and school bullying. Our neighbour Karen started her campaign against us immediately. That dog barks. She complained on day one. Buddy had whimpered once, his alert signal that Emma was distressed. I explained about Emma's autism, how Buddy was literally her voice. Karen's response well, maybe she belongs in a special facility then. I installed cameras after that comment. Good thing I did. Emma loves routine. Every morning at 7 a. M. She and Buddy do Rainbow time in our backyard. She arranges colored toys and patterns while Buddy sits guard. It's her therapy, recommended by three different specialists. Violent, peaceful, bothering nobody. Last Tuesday I was inside making Emma's specific breakfast. She only eats yellow foods on Tuesdays when Buddy started his alert bark. Not aggressive. Three short barks, meaning Emma needs help now. I rushed outside to find Karen in our yard, having climbed our fence, trying to document the neglect with her phone. Emma was in full meltdown mode. When her routine gets disrupted, she self harms, hitting herself, pulling her hair. Buddy was doing his trained response, putting his body between Emma and Karen while alert barking. For me, Karen was screaming, it's attacking me, rabbit dog! I scooped up Emma, who is now completely nonverbal and scratching at her arms. Get out of my yard! I shouted at Karen, who was still filming. This is child endangerment, she yelled back. Leaving a disabled child with a vicious animal. I'm calling CPS and animal Control. I got Emma inside, gave her her weighted blanket.

Around 1:30, my phone started buzzing. First text asking me to call the bank because her card got declined. Then increasingly frantic messages as she realized she couldn't pay for anything. Half an hour later, she came storming in, yelling about how embarrassing it was when her cards got declined, how her friend had to pay for lunch. I was sitting on the couch with voice papers in my lap and boxes beside me. When she stopped yelling, I told her, real calm, yeah, I canceled the cards because you don't need them anymore. That's when she noticed the papers and boxes. I handed her the divorce papers and explained this was her graduation from practice marriage. The look on her face was worth every penny I'd spent on her. Pure shock, then panic, then desperate backtracking. She tried every approach, claiming it was a joke, apologizing, getting angry, making it my fault. But the damage was done. I'd heard exactly what she thought of our marriage. When she tried to argue. She couldn't be kicked out because it was her house, too. I showed her the prenup. You could see her face change as she realized how screwed she was. She signed away any claim to everything. I gave her two hours to pack and get out. She tried crying, tried arguing, tried one last desperate plea. I told her she should have thought about that before calling me. Practice

Haley acted completely normal while I sat there thinking how she basically admitted to using me as a financial safety net. Monday morning, I called in sick, went to my lawyer. Best decision I ever made was insisting on that prenup three years ago. Haley hadn't been happy about it. Kept saying it showed I didn't trust her. Turns out my paranoia was justified. The clean up was straightforward. Anything I owned before marriage stayed mine. Anything I earned during marriage stayed mine. Unless she could prove financial contribution. Since she'd quit working and hadn't contributed financially in two years, she had no claim to the house, savings, or car. I spent the week quietly preparing. Moved money from joint accounts, changed passwords, updated contact information. Haley never noticed because she never paid attention to finances anyway. I had divorce papers drawn up Thursday. Then I waited for the perfect moment. Saturday morning, as soon as she left for brunch with her girlfriends, I called to cancel her credit cards and froze our joint checking account. 30 minutes to cut off the financial pipeline.

I've been married to Haley for three years. Decent marriage, or so I thought. I made good money. She'd quit her job a year after we got married to figure out what she really wanted to do, and I've been supporting both of us ever since. Last Friday, she had her girlfriends over for dinner, like she did every month. I cooked, serve them, then went to clean up. That's when I heard my name and tuned in. Honestly, girls, Anthony's just my practice husband until I find someone better. I literally froze with a plate in my hand. Her friend asked what she meant by practice husband, and Haley started explaining how I was good for now because I paid all her bills and did the cooking, but she wasn't planning to stay with me forever. Said I was fine for practice, but not husband material long term. The problem was she couldn't leave me yet because I paid for everything. All three started laughing like it was the funniest thing ever. What hit me wasn't just what she said, it was how casually she said it. Like obvious accepted fact. She wasn't confessing some secret, just stating the situation, like commenting on the weather. After her friends left, I waited an hour before confronting her. When I asked about the practice husband comment, she acted confused at First, when I spelled it out, her whole demeanor changed. Oh, that? Yeah, I said that.

I didn't yell, I just smiled. The entire table went quiet because they knew that smile meant something was coming. Later, Amanda and mom were giggling in the kitchen. Don't look so serious, mom said. It was just a prank. You're acting like they burned down your house, Amanda said. I worked months of overtime for that laptop. Amanda shrugged. Then buy another one. Dad walked in. Have to let things go. They're just kids. That was it. They weren't going to apologize. Something shifted that night. I'd spent years being the bigger person, but watching Carla cry while everyone laughed broke something inside me. I started thinking about everything I'd done for this family. Bills I'd covered when Amanda forgot rent. Times I'd bailed them out. A month later, mom called. Amanda's in a tough spot. Could you help with rent? The same sister whose kids destroyed a two thousand dollar laptop while everyone laughed? You can't hold on to that forever. No. A week later, I checked my joint emergency account. Nearly $1,800 gone in a transfer to Amanda. I called mom. Why did two grand disappear? Amanda was about to get evicted. That wasn't your money to give. That night, I closed the account and transferred everything to My personal savings. Then I made a spreadsheet listing every favor over the years. The total shocked me.

Only without Amanda's constant emergencies, my savings grew fast. I bought Carla an even better laptop. Meanwhile, Amanda posted pictures of her kids with expensive new tablets. I screenshotted it. Evidence. Through work, I had influence over supplier relationships my dad's business relied on. When contract renewals came up, I was asked about their account. Late payments, missed shipments. I've been given three Grace periods in 12 months, I said calmly. Continuing without a payment plan would be a liability. Dad called, furious. Did you tell them to put us on prepaid? We'll go under! Maybe you should have thought about that before you laughed while my kid cried and stole from my account! When Amanda posted about people turning their backs on family, I sent her husband screenshots of her luxury purchases and the stolen money. Amanda called, screaming, how dare you! You went behind mine first! With been months, everything collapsed. Dad's business lost contracts. They sold the house below market value. Amanda's marriage was shaken. Mom finally called to apologize. We laughed when we should have defended Carla. We've paid for it. Amanda showed up weeks later, defeated. You ruined me! You ruined yourself! I just stopped cleaning up after you. That evening, Carla brought me a drawing. A big tree standing tall after a storm, with two figures smiling at the bottom. Looks like we made it through, she said. I framed it and hung it where the melted laptop used to Sit. When my family called to pull me back into their chaos, I didn't answer. Not out of anger, but peace.

Yesterday, she gave them all back. When Heather was 18, she walked into the kitchen carrying an old Adidas shoebox and said, dad, I need to show you something. She set the box on the counter and lifted the lid. Inside were hundreds of napkins, post its index cards. They were every lunch note I'd ever written her. You kept these? I asked. She nodded. Every single one. I'd started writing them when she was 6. The divorce between her mom and I had been final for two months. Her mom got weekends and holidays. I got weekdays. I meant I did all the school stuff. The problem was, I didn't know how to do school stuff. That first Monday of kindergarten, I packed Heather a peanut butter sandwich, apple slices, and a juice box. She came home talking non stop about everyone else's lunch. Catherine's mom made sushi rolls that look like pandas. And Julie's mom cut her sandwich into a butterfly with cookie cutter. And Joyce had a note from her mom in her lunch box that said, I love you to the moon and back, with a drawing of a rocket ship. Did you like your lunch? I asked. It was fine, she said, but I could tell she was envious. That night, after she went to bed, I stared at her lunch bag. I couldn't make sushi. I didn't own cookie cutters. But I could write I Grabbed a napkin and wrote, you're braver than you know. Love, dad. The next morning, I tucked it under her sandwich. When she got home, she ran to hug me and said, I saw the napkin. Ellie asked if my mom wrote it, and I said, no, my dad did. Nobody else's dad writes notes. I love you, dad. So I kept writing them. At first they were simple. Have a great day, or, you're my favorite person. Then I started adding drawings. Terrible ones. A cat that looked like a potato. A son with sunglasses. Our dog if our dog was made of circles. My first grade, I was writing jokes. What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear. Told me her table laughed so hard, the lunch monitor had to shush them. Second grade, I started writing them based on what was happening before her spelling test. You got this. Those words don't stand a chance. After she'd fought with her friend. Being kind when you're hurt is the hardest kind of brave. Sit down, Heather said that morning in the kitchen. I need to show you how I organized them. She'd separated them into sections with rubber bands and labeled sticky notes. The first bundle said, funny. She pulled one from third grade. Why don't eggs tell jokes? Cracker. Another one had a drawing of me attempting to dance at her recital. This is still the worst drawing you've ever done, she said. Laughing. The next section was labeled Bad Days. These were thicker napkins, longer notes. She pulled one from seventh grade. You are exactly who you're supposed to be. Not who they say you are. Not who you think you should be. Who you are. That hey, Ruth had told everyone I was weird for not having a mom at home. That I was probably weird, too. How did you know? She said that I hadn't known. I just wrote what I wished someone would tell me. She pulled out another bundle. This one made my chest tight. The label said, saved me. This section is from eighth grade. Mostly. She said she pulled out a coffee stained napkin. You're not alone. You never have been. You never will be. Even when I'm not there, I'm there. She showed me another one from that year.

She could come back when she had a real plan. She ran to her room crying and my husband came in asking what all the yelling was about. When I explained, he said maybe I was being too harsh. Emma's always been a homebody and maybe forcing her out wasn't the answer. But I stood my ground. The next day, Emma's grandmother called me screaming. Emma had called her crying about how I was kicking her out for wanting to be a traditional wife. My mother in law went on this whole rant about how back in her day women didn't need careers and how I was being a terrible feminist mother for not supporting my daughter's choices. Then Emma's best friend's mom texted me saying I was wrong for not respecting my daughter's dreams. Apparently Emma had been telling everyone I was forcing her to abandon her values and become some kind of career obsessed woman who doesn't want kids. But that's not what I said at all. I never said she couldn't be a stay at home mom. I said she needed a backup plan. Some kind of skill or education or work experience. Even just working part time at target would give her basic customer service skills and show her what it's like to earn her own money. The whole thing came to a head last week when Emma announced she joined some online matchmaking group for traditional Wives. She showed me this website where women post profiles talking about how they want to be homemakers, and men look for wives who will stay home. Some of these women were 18, 19 years old, talking about how they're looking for older men who can financially support them immediately. I told her she was basically looking for someone to take care of her like a child, not a partner. That set her off again. She screamed that I didn't understand her generation, that I was stuck in some second wave feminist mindset, and that plenty of women choose to be traditional wives. My husband finally stepped in and said we needed family counseling. Emma refused. She said she'd rather move out than listen to some therapist tell her that her dreams were wrong. So I told her, fine, start packing. She's been staying with her grandmother for the past week.

My daughter Emma just turned 18 and graduated high school two months ago. Since she was about 15, she's been talking about how she doesn't wanna go to college or get a job. She wants to find a husband and be a stay at home mom, period. That's it. That's her entire life plan. At first I thought it was just teenage talk, like how kids say they want to be astronauts or YouTube stars. But she's been dead serious about it for three years now. No college applications, no job hunting, nothing. She spends most of her time watching these TikTok videos about traditional wives and reading blogs about homemaking. Last month she came to me with what she called her life plan. She was going to live at home with me and my husband until she found a husband. She figured she'd meet someone at church or maybe through friends, marry them within a year or two, then have kids right away. When I asked what she'd do if something happened to her hypothetical husband, she just shrugged and said she'd move back in with us. I lost it. I told her that wasn't happening. If she wanted to live at home after graduation, she needed to either get a job or go to school. Community college, trade school, something she didn't have to get a four year degree. But she needed some kind of plan that didn't involve sitting around waiting for Prince Charming. She started crying and said I was being mean and that being a mom was a real job. I told her I wasn't saying being a mom wasn't work, but what happens if her husband dies or leaves or gets disabled? What if they can't have kids? What if he turns out to be abusive? She needed something to fall back on. That's when she dropped the bomb. She said her backup plan was literally me and my husband. If anything went wrong, she just moved back home and we'd support her and any kids she might have. I asked what would happen if we died or couldn't help anymore, and she said, I don't know, mom. This is ridiculous. None of it is going to happen. I told her she was being naive and that I wouldn't enable this fantasy. I said if she graduated and didn't have a job or wasn't in school.

I had just been served divorce papers during my lunch break by someone named Sophia, citing abandonment after five years of marriage. The problem was that I had never been married and had definitely never met anyone named Sophia in my entire life. Maybe it's a different Ryan, my coworker suggested as he studied them more carefully. But then his expression changed. This has your Social Security number and your address and your parents names as in laws. I stared at the signature on the marriage certificate attachment, and my blood ran cold because it looked exactly like my handwriting, down to the way I always make my R's too narrow. This has to be identity theft, I said, but my voice sounded shaky. I dialed the law office with trembling hands, trying to explain that someone was impersonating me. The attorney listened patiently before responding, Mister Ryan, I understand this is emotional, but denying your marriage won't make this simpler. And we have extensive documentation, including wedding photos and joint tax returns. I tried to process that they supposedly had wedding photos of me that I'd never seen. Where are you claiming this marriage took place? I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. Vegas, five years ago. You've been living together in the marital home ever since, though apparently you haven't been there for the past two years, she replied. But five years ago, I was living alone in my current apartment. And I had the least to prove it. There must be some mistake. I've never even been to Vegas. I insisted the attorney side. Mister Ryan, your wife has photo albums and five years of documentation. Perhaps you should review the materials I'm sending before making

Three days after Grandpa died, my parents arrived at my door with flowers and a business proposal. They wanted guardianship of my unborn baby. Turns out Grandpa had left behind a trust fund that paid $100,000 a year to whoever raised his great grandchildren. My parents were claiming if I gave guardianship to them, we could all have access to it. It's a win win. They smiled sweetly. They left after I told them I needed time to think. They waited exact three days before going nuclear. I was making breakfast when mom called, crying. The cancer is back at stage 4. Treatment is $80,000 a year, and insurance won't cover it. Two hours later, Annika showed up at my house. She snuck in using the spare key and put her hands on my belly. Before I could react, I had to go through seven years of pain. She whispered, her fingers spreading across my skin like she was claiming territory. Seven years of needles and failure and empty cribs. She swore that with a trust fund, she would give my baby everything I was stressed about private schools, funds, a big backyard to play in. The baby kicked, and I wondered if I was being selfish by keeping her. When you've been trained since birth to put family first, setting boundaries feels like a trail. The breaking point came when mom sent a photo of herself in A hospital bed with an IV in her arm. Starting chemo tomorrow. The caption read. I wish I could afford the treatment that actually works. I arrived to granddad's funeral three weeks later with guardianship papers tucked in my purse. But as the last hymn ended and the funeral director cleared his throat, everything changed. He announced that our grandfather had left specific instructions for this moment. Suddenly, the screen behind the casket came to life, and there was a recording of Grandpa propped up in his hospital bed and staring directly at the camera. If my daughter Evelyn

There wasn't gonna be a 48. Everyone told me I was too lenient with my best friend Kathy, and always made excuses for her when she flaked out on plans to be with her boyfriend. And maybe they were right. I mean, two years ago, she had offered to take me out for brunch after I was feeling down over losing my job, when she suddenly texted me, can't make it. Jake surprised me with breakfast in bed. And the worst part of it was that I was literally already there at our reserve table ordering two mimosas. Then it was the birthday dinner where she showed up 90 minutes late, then left after 10 minutes because Jake asked her to come over. Same thing when I was moving apartments and when my mom was having surgery, and I really needed a friend. And you think that was the final straw, right? No. It wasn't until Kathy flaked out on my mom's no. That I realized I was chasing after someone who clearly didn't want me around like I wanted her. So I stopped inviting her to things, focused on myself, joined a climbing gym, made some new friends, and made space for old friends who actually wanted to be there. And by the time my birthday came around, my dinner table was full of people who cared and made time for me, too. But just as things started turning Around Kathy came back, I was packing up my climbing gear when I suddenly got a flood of texts. Jake cheated on me with crying emojis filled my notifications. I glanced at it, then went straight back to packing. Three more texts came through in rapid succession. Um, hello. I'm literally heartbroken. Then I'm coming over getting wine and ice cream. That only made me pack even faster. My phone rang, and I let it go to voicemail. A text instantly popped up. Are you seriously not gonna be here when I need you? Well, that was ironic.

The whole table stopped eating. I nearly choked on my sandwich because everyone had been thinking something was off, but nobody had said it out loud. She's just helping me with homework, I said, looking around to make sure no teachers were nearby. But Megan was already shaking her head at me. Roger sat down his juice box deliberately and said, stop defending her. She let you turn in your lab report a week late. A week? She gave me a zero for being one day late. I suddenly felt defensive of Miss White. Maybe he had a good reason, I said quickly. She's strict, but she's fair. There has to be an explanation. Megan's voice came out sharp. Roger, what exactly have you seen? Roger pulled out his phone. His movements quick, angry. I made a list. Look at this and tell me this is normal. He showed everyone his notes app. The list made me uncomfortable. Me sleeping in class without punishment. Me eating full meals during lectures. Me getting bathroom passes whenever I wanted. Me staying after school with a key to her classroom. Megan leaned forward, reading everything. This. This does look weird. What's your explanation? An explanation? I insisted. There's nothing to explain. She's just being helpful. Roger wasn't finished. He swiped to another page. This was yesterday. Tell me this isn't suspicious. The photo showed Miss White putting bags in my car after school. I stared at it, my mind racing. This is innocent. She was helping me with something. Helping you with what, exactly?

You're taller, way better than my boyfriend. The crowd cheered. I just left. The next morning, she realized she'd lost more than just me. My girlfriend Maya had this male best friend, Eric, who was always around, always touching her arm, always looking at her like she was his prize. Six months earlier, I'd laid it out clearly. Either put serious distance between you two, or we're done. She cried, promised he was just a friend. And for months, things seemed better. Then came the concert. I busted my ass to get expensive tickets to her favorite band. It was supposed to be our date night. We get through the gates, and the first person I see is Eric, standing there with this smug grin. What's he doing here? I asked, not hiding my irritation. Maya went defensive immediately. Oh, my god! God, Leo, don't start. He got a ticket from a friend. It's total coincidence. The look Eric gave me, that little victorious smirk, told me everything. This was no coincidence. This was a. She lied to me and broken the one promise I made. A deal breaker. But I paid for those tickets, so I decided to just ignore them. Stupid plan. Because Maya and Eric had other ideas. They were all over each other the entire time. Whispering, laughing at inside jokes I wasn't part of. She was putting on a performance, and I was the chump in the background. I wasn't her date. I was just the guy who drove her there. When the headliner came on, the crowd surged forward and Maya started complaining she couldn't see Leo. Let me get on your shoulders, she said, like nothing was wrong. You know I have a bad back, I told her, suggesting we move to the side instead. She gave me a five second pout, then turned to Eric with that bright fake smile.

Even bought my brother Mason his Epipens with her waitressing money. Well, last Saturday, I was babysitting Mason when it happened. We were at the park and some kid shared his granola bar. Mason was six bites in when his face started swelling. Where's your Epipen? I asked. Already checking his backpack. His eyes went wide with panic. Jessica has it. She said she'd bring it. My stomach dropped. Jessica was supposed to meet us at noon. It was 12:17. I called her immediately. Restaurant noise and laughter filled the phone. This better be important. Mason's having a reaction. Where are you with his Epipen? I'm on a date. Finally, after three years. Jessica. He ate peanuts. Throat is closing. Are you kidding me right now? You're supposed to be here with his medication. I'm supposed to be 22 and having a life. This is the first time James could get reservations at this place. He needs his Epipen now.

Eric just stared at me with that same smug, punchable face. He'd won. That's when everything went quiet for me. The music, the crowd. Everything just faded.

Chicken and vegetables. It only cost me three dollars to make, I said. Must be nice to know how to cook, he said while placing another forty dollar dinner order, including delivery fees and tip.

The pasta had started smoking and set off the fire alarm. Travis, what the hell are You doing? I asked, while fanning smoke out the window. The box says cook for eight minutes in water, so I put it in water and set the microwave for eight minutes. It was still crunchy, so I added more time, he explained.

We'd kept separate accounts for that. But our apartment, our life together, 12 years since college. All fake. Monday, I met with three divorce attorneys while she thought I was at work. Chose the one who could file fastest. Then I contacted his wife. We met at a coffee shop while our spouses were on another work trip. Hers to help her mother, his for a conference that didn't exist. I showed her everything. She just stare at the hotel receipt from their weekend. The same weekend her mother had been in the hospital for surgery. He used my mother's cancer for a fair time, she said, voice flat. Sunday evening, my wife came home from her weekend with her sister. Kissed me hello. Said she missed me. Asked if I wanted to order Thai food. I hit record on my phone, per lawyer's advice. How's your sister? I asked. Good. We had fun shopping. That's nice. Where'd you stay? She named a hotel the wrong one. She couldn't even keep her lies straight. Funny, because the Marriott Downtown says you stayed there with Mark. Her face went white, then red. Then came tears and denials. Then partial confession. Just one kiss at a bar months ago. She swore. Nothing more. I laughed. Actually laughed. Eight months, Rebecca. I've seen everything. The photos you sent him. The I love you messages. The plans to leave me after my parents Anniversary. Because you didn't want to ruin my grief, period. She tried everything. Blamed me for working too much. Said I'd grown distant after my parents died. Then when nothing worked, she went nuclear. You have no family left. I'm all you have. You'll be completely alone. She knew exactly where to strike. My parents died in a car accident two years ago. No siblings. She'd been my only family. Better alone.

Also, you're not infertile. You're on birth control. The pills are in your medicine cabinet, behind the vitamins. The funeral home erupted. Now, Grandpa's voice continued calmly, my granddaughter, if you're holding guardianship papers right now, and I know you are, because you always want the best for everyone, read page 4, subsection C, out loud. My hands trembled as I flipped through the pages. Permanent and a reversible transfer of parental rights. The guardianship was never meant to be permanent. Your mother's friend drafted those. Stand up, Joe. A man in the fifth row reluctantly stood, face bright red. Mom was freaking. Turn this off! He's destroying our family! Evelyn, you're about to say I was always manipulative. Three, two, one. He was always manipulative, she screamed. Too predictable. Oh, and sweetheart, his voice softened, addressing me. Check under that pregnancy book I gave you. There was a USB. And in seconds, a recording of my mother's voice filled the funeral home. When dad dies, let's tell Opie the cancer's back. She always caves when I cry. And here's the kicker. Grandpa's video continued over the chaos. The trust can only be accessed by biological parents. Guardianship changes nothing. You exposed yourselves for money you could never touch. The funeral home turned in to a battlefield. Family members screaming, mom lunging for the screen, the funeral director calling security. I stood there ripping those guardianship papers into pieces. One more thing. Grandpa's voice echoed for the last. Time about the trust money. I already put it in a locked account for the baby, accessible only at 18. To the child directly. Oh, and Evelyn, if you're still watching this, your parking meter ran out 20 minutes ago. He kept going. And what he said next made my face drain of color. My mother's face went from angry to terrified. Turn it off! She screamed. She doesn't need to know. And after I found out, I was ready to destroy them in the same way they destroyed me. But worse.

Rebecca called 6 7 times between six PM and midnight. Messages progressed from confused to angry to desperate. She claimed Connor didn't mean it, was just showing off for friends, that I was overreacting to. Typical teenager behavior. I texted back once saying I needed space and would contact her when ready, then blocked her number to avoid the emotional manipulation building in her messages. Monday morning, I contacted my bank and removed Rebecca as joint account holder. Called the mortgage company. Thankfully, my name wasn't on the loan. Rebecca had refinanced in her name only six months before we moved in together. The mortgage was due the first. By the fifth, Rebecca contacted me through a mutual friend with a frantic message explaining she didn't have enough money to cover the mortgage, begging me to reconsider. She claimed she talked to Connor and he was very sorry, wanted to apologize personally. I responded that I appreciated her reaching out, but my decision was final. I'd already put a deposit down on a one bedroom apartment across town. Rebecca's sister called Thursday night saying Rebecca was having panic attacks about potentially losing the house. Tried guilting me about abandoning a single mother and her child. I calmly explained I've been financially supporting them for two years while being treated as an outsider in my own home. Friday evening, Rebecca showed up at my brother's place crying, begging to talk. Against better judgment, I agreed to Speak on the front porch. Rebecca looked like she hadn't slept in days. Admitted she'd been wrong. Undermine my authority with Connor. Gotten too comfortable with our financial arrangement. Offered to add my name to the mortgage. Suggested couples counseling. I listened to everything, then explained the issue wasn't just about chores or Connor's attitude. She created a dynamic where I was expected to provide without receiving respect or having any real say in household decisions. Told her I cared about them both, but couldn't continue being treated like a premium rent paying tenant.

Three days after Grandpa died, my parents arrived at my door with flowers and a business proposal. They wanted guardianship of my unborn baby. Turns out Grandpa had left behind a trust fund that paid $100,000 a year to whoever raised his great grandchildren. My parents were claiming if I gave guardianship to them, we could all have access to it. It's a win win. They smiled sweetly. They left after I told them I needed time to think. They waited exactly three days before going nuclear. I was making breakfast when mom called, crying. The cancer is back at stage 4. Treatment is $80,000 a year, and insurance won't cover it. Two hours later, Annika showed up at my house. She snuck in using the spare key and put her hands on my belly. Before I could react, I had to go through seven years of pain. She whispered, her fingers spreading across my skin like she was claiming territory. Seven years of needles and failure and empty cribs. She swore that with a trust fund, she would give my baby everything I was stressed about private schools, college funds, a big backyard to play in. The baby kicked, and I wondered if I was being selfish by keeping her. When you've been trained since birth to put family first, setting boundaries feels like a trail. The breaking point came when mom sent a photo of herself. In a hospital bed with an IV in her arm, starting chemo tomorrow. The caption read. I wish I could afford the treatment that actually works. I arrived to granddad's funeral three weeks later with guardian ship papers tucked in my purse. But as the last hymn ended and the funeral director cleared his throat, everything changed. He announced that our grandfather had left specific the constructions for this moment. Suddenly, the screen behind the casket came to life, and there was a recording of Grandpa propped up in his hospital bed and staring directly at the camera. If my daughter Evelyn is perking up right now thinking this is about trust distributions, he said, and Mom's eager face shifted to

I moved out quietly. I'm 38. Been with my girlfriend Rebecca for three years. She has a 15 year old son, Connor, whose biological father moved states away when Connor was eight. The deadbeat sends maybe $200 monthly when he remembers. Rebecca works part time at a dental office making $30,000 while I pull $95,000 as a project manager. When we moved in together two years ago, I took over her 2 thousand two hundred dollar mortgage payments, plus utilities, groceries and Connor's expenses. Phone, clothes, sports equipment, everything. Rebecca insisted we keep separate finances, which I stupidly agreed to. Looking back, this arrangement only benefited her while I shouldered the financial burden. Connor and I had what I thought was a decent relationship. I never tried replacing his father, but expected base, take respect and help with household chores. Taking out trash, keeping his room clean, weekend yard work. Nothing unreasonable. Rebecca constantly undermined me, saying I was too strict or Connor needed time to adjust. Red flag I ignored. Last Saturday, I was in the kitchen making lunch when Connor's three friends came over. They were hanging out in the living room and Connor was complaining loudly about raking leaves that morning. Our house has thin walls and they weren't keeping voices down. One friend asked why Connor had to do chores when his Mom's boyfriend was home. Connor's response hit like a punch to the gut. My real dad would never make me do chores like this loser. This guy thinks he can boss me around just because he pays for stuff. My mom says I don't have to listen to him anyway. His friends laughed. Once said Connor was lucky having someone pay for everything while doing whatever he wanted. Connor agreed, adding that his mom told him I wasn't going anywhere because I was too.

My neighbour Bethany treated her Pomeranian, Princess, like a golden ticket to break every rule. The fake service vest fooled nobody with experience. She'd bring Princess into the gym, claiming emotional support privileges while the dog peed on equipment. She'd let Princess destroy the community garden because service animals need enrichment activities. She'd have Princess bark through movie nights, insisting it was medical alert behaviour. Living in the same building meant I witnessed Bethany's blaming abuse of the system. First was Mister Beckett in the grocery store. Princess tore into his bags, scattered food everywhere while snarling. When he asked Bethany to pay for damages, she screamed about discrimination. She threatened to sue him for trapping her service animal. He was an elderly widower who couldn't afford lawyers. He just absorbed the loss. Two weeks later, during a residents meeting, Princess defecated next to the coffee station. Our property manager asked Bethany to clean it. She exploded about ADA violations and demanded written apologies. She called the Fair Housing Department while the manager cleaned feces in front of 30 residents. Stephanie still filed a formal complaint, claiming the building created a hostile environment. The worst came when Princess attacked Derek's actual service dog, Duke. Duke was a German Shepherd who helped Derek walk after losing his leg overseas. Princess lashed on to Duke's ear at the mailboxes, drawing blood. Duke remained perfectly still. Derek Almost fell without Duke's support. Bethany immediately filed paperwork claiming Duke was aggressive and intimidating. She demanded he be banned from the building. Three weeks after Derek's attack, I was returning from the VA hospital with Ranger. My PTSD service dog nudged my hand, warning my heart rate was spiking. The elevator opened, revealing Bethany and Princess. Pomeranian launched across the lobby and locked onto Ranger's shoulder. Teeth sank deep in muscle. Blood seeped through his fur. While Ranger stayed motionless, still trying to work. I pried Princess's jaws apart with my hands. Your mother attacked my medical alert dog. Bethany shrieked, already dialing 9 1 1. Any police here now? A dangerous dog tried to kill mine. She told dispatch I was faking disability, that Ranger was aggressive. Four hours at the station defending my documentation. Four hours while Ranger waited at the emergency vet for 12 stitches. Four hours of explaining how a certified service dog could stand perfectly still while being mauled, watching them stitch Ranger's

After a month she was teaching me secret tricks I didn't know existed, and she chose in the username Defi Knitting and joined a guild without telling me, though she mentioned making friends who didn't constantly ask about her cholesterol levels. Then my mother discovered grandma wearing a headset shouting tank the Boss properly or I'll shove my cane somewhere extremely uncomfortable at her monitor. During one of the hardest battles in the game, she called me, screaming that I turned her mother in law into a gambling addict because online games were just slot machines with dragons, and that I was destroying an old woman's golden years. She tried canceling Grandma's internet, but grandma had already switched everything into her own name with two factor authentication.

I've never loved him more. I've always known I'm not conventionally attractive. It's just a fact I've lived with my entire life. Growing up, kids called me names. In high school, I was invisible to boys. In college, I watched my roommates get asked out while I stayed home studying. But when I met Charles four years ago at a coffee shop where I spilled latte all over his laptop, he made me feel beautiful for the first time in my life. He never just said I was pretty and left it at that. He trace my face with his fingers and tell me I had the kindest eyes he'd ever seen. He kiss my forehead and say my smile could light up any room. For four years, I actually started believing him. Last Saturday, his college buddies came over for their monthly hangout. These guys have been friends since freshman year. The kind of bond where they could say anything to each other. I was upstairs in the kitchen making my famous buffalo chicken dip and cutting up vegetables when I heard their voices drifting up from the basement rec room. I shouldn't have listened, but I couldn't help myself. At first it was normal guy talk. Work complaints, fantasy football, whose turn it was to pick the next restaurant for their group dinner. Then I heard my name. They were absolutely roasting Charles about me. Dude, seriously? Her? Arthur laughed, and I could Hear the beer bottles clinking? I mean, what happened to your standards, man? Another voice, I think it was Anthony, chimed in. Yeah, she's got a nice personality and all, but come on. She's what we used to call a butterface back in the day. The whole group erupted in laughter that made my stomach drop. Remember when you used to date those sorority girls? Someone else added. What was her name? Amber. Now she was smoking hot. I gripped the kitchen counter, my knuckles turning white. This was my worst nightmare coming true. These were Charles's closest friends, the guys he'd known longest, and they were talking about me like I was some charity case. Then Charles exploded. His voice boomed through the house.

So I spent years perfecting my payback. I discovered Dave's cheating when I saw a graphic text on his work phone. The message was explicit and had no business being on anyone's work device. For a split second, I just stared at the lock screen showing the sender's name, Paula. My brain immediately started connecting dots I've been ignoring for months. Dave always stepped out to take calls, meaning hippo violations. If I overheard, he'd come home with the same perfume scent saying he helped move female patients. Our bedroom life had cooled off significantly, and he was always getting called in for sick nurse coverage at odd hours. But he. Here's the thing. When our kid left a book in Dave's car, I had an excuse to visit the hospital. I casually mentioned to a lobby nurse how work phones seem convenient but keep you on call 24 7. She laughed and said the hospital was too cheap for nurse phone. Only high level executives got them. Dave wasn't an executive. I rushed to a divorce lawyer the next day, but the news was devastating. Community, property, state. No fault divorce. I made more money. He was primary caretaker of our three kids. If I filed, I'd lose the house, pay alimony, child support, and give him half my retirement. The worst part? His affair didn't legally matter. At all. I was crushed until my friend Andy said something that changed everything. If you don't like the hand you're dealt, change the. I had two problems to solve. First, I needed to become the primary caretaker. I transferred to a regulatory admin position that nobody wanted. Just number crunching. With flexible hours, I could work from home and set my own schedule. With my newfound freedom, I started picking up the kids from school, helping with homework, making dinner every night. I can't explain how much I genuinely enjoyed being more involved in their daily lives. Meanwhile, Dave seemed relieved to have more study time. Second, Dave needed to out earn me. I

My cousin Ashley has mimicked everything I've done since we were kids. Same clothes, same haircuts, same hobbies. When I Learned guitar, she bought one the next week. When I got into photography, suddenly she was a photographer, too. It was annoying, but I thought she'd grow out of it. I was wrong. It got worse in college. Same major as me. Marketing. Same internships. She even transferred to my university sophomore year, claiming she just loved the campus. When she visited me after graduation, I moved to Portland for a job. Guess who showed up six months later? Ashley. With a job at a competing company. She rented an apartment two blocks from mine. But the final straw was when she started dating my ex boyfriend, Richard. We dated for two years in college. He cheated on me with some girl from his fraternity, and it destroyed me. Ashley knew all of this? She was there when I cried about it for months. Yet suddenly, they're soulmates who met through fate. Their Instagram was nauseating, recreating the exact same photos Richard and I used to take. Same restaurants, same hiking spots, even the same poses. My family thought it was romantic. They're so perfect together. My aunt would gush. I wanted to scream. Then Ashley started copying my social media posts word for word. I'd post about trying a new coffee shop. She'd post the same review. The next day I'd share a workout routine. She'd claim it was her personal fitness journey. She even copied my dog's Instagram captions for her cat. It was getting psychotic, so I decided to test just how far she'd go. First I posted about my amazing new skincare routine drinking a shot of apple cider vinegar every morning. Complete lie, but I made it sound life changing. My skin has never looked better. This ancient remedy is incredible. Three days later, Ashley posted her morning vinegar shot video. She was trying not to gag, but captioned it already seeing amazing results. For two weeks, she posted daily.

My seven year old daughter started telling me she was seeing a man walking around our house at night. Every time I just laughed, passing it off as one of those weird things kids say. But every morning she kept repeating the same story. She said she heard someone sneak into our house while we were asleep, that he'd climb in through the living room window, then go upstairs and hurt my son. At first I thought she just had an overactive imagination. I mean, I know if someone was actually breaking in, wouldn't I? Still, something about the way she said it started to creep me out. So that night, I made sure every door and window was locked before heading to bed. I even double checked the alarm system and told myself it was just for peace of mind. Around three in the morning, my daughter came running into our bedroom. She was shaking and said, he's here again. This time I didn't brush it off. I grabbed my flashlight and hurried downstairs. Every door was locked, but when I got to the living room window, I pulled on it and it slid open without any resistance. My heart dropped. She wasn't imagining it. Someone had been getting in. I bolted upstairs and grabbed my rifle from the closet, then quietly crept down the hallway toward my son's room. I took a deep breath, pushed open his door, and Aimed into the dark. There was someone in there, punched over my son's bed. My finger was already on the trigger. Then my son screamed, stop! I flipped on the light. What I saw made me freeze. It wasn't a grown man. It was a teenager, maybe 17 or 18. My son scrambled out of bed, throwing himself between us. I lowered the rifle, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. My brain felt like it short circuited. The intruder wasn't hurting him. He was holding him, comforting him. That's when it clicked. This guy wasn't a stranger. He was my son's boyfriend. Apparently, they've been sneaking around for months. My son hadn't told us he was gay, let alone in a relationship. He thought we wouldn't accept it. His boyfriend, not wanting to get him in trouble, had been sneaking into the house late at night, not realizing anyone else knew. I stood there in silence, rifle in one hand, flashlight in the other, heart still pounding in my ear.

A couple months ago, my twin sister and I had just started high school. At first, I thought she was just adjusting, but within a few weeks, I noticed something was seriously wrong. She barely spoke, kept her head down in the hallways. And the second we got home, she would rush into her room and lock the door. Most nights, I heard her crying through the walls. Teacher started calling home. They said she was always in tears during class. Couldn't focus, and her grades were falling fast. Tried asking her what was wrong, but she always forced a smile and told me everything was fine. It wasn't. One day, I found her sitting on the bathroom floor, her eyes swollen and a bottle of sleeping pills open beside her. That was the moment I knew something had to change. My mom sat me down that night and told me the truth. There was a senior boy at school who had been bullying my sister. He would shove her into lockers, tear up her homework in front of other students, and humiliate her in the hallways while everyone watched. She had never said a word about it to me. My mom looked me in the eyes and said, do whatever you need to do. I don't care what the school says. I'll forgive you. I didn't waste a second. I started asking around and eventually found out the guy's name was Brian. He was a smug, blond haired senior who spent most of his time alone and skipped class constantly. Every day at 11:15 in the morning, he would sneak off to the far gym bathroom to smoke. So I waited. One day, I skipped class and locked myself in the stall of that same bathroom. As soon as he walked in, I came out and locked the door behind him. He barely had time to speak before I slammed into him and knocked him to the ground. I pulled a rope from my backpack and wrapped it tightly around his body, pinning his arms to his sides. Then I started swinging punch after punch. I didn't stop. His face, his ribs, his chest, whatever I could hit. I wanted him to feel what my sister had been feeling for months. He cried and begged me to stop, but I didn't care. Who's the tough guy now? But I wasn't done. I pulled out my car keys, aimed right between his legs, and tried to tear him apart. His screams were so loud that a staff member heard.

I walked inside to see this woman and the girl who had been badly hurt. Oh, good, finally, she said. I asked her what happened, and she told me her niece Daisy fell off the playground equipment at the park. Kids, right? She gave a tight smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. But then again, people react to stress differently. I took a look at her head, and it was bad. Daisy was being remarkably brave, while her brother Jimmy sniffled beside her. She's usually more careful, she added, checking her watch. How long do these things usually take? I looked closer at Daisy's head, but thought it was strange. It did look like it was from falling on the ground at all. I asked Daisy to tell me exactly how she fell. I was on the monkey bars, and then I. She trailed off, glancing nervously at her aunt.

Ma'am, why don't you and Jimmy wait outside while I prep Daisy for stitches? It can be scary for little ones to watch. He seemed relieved to leave, finally. Come on, Jimmy. Stop that crying. Once they were gone, I gently asked Daisy again. Sweetie, I need to know what really happened so I can help you properly. Her eyes filled with tears, but she. She stayed silent, shaking her head. She was terrified of something. Or someone. I made a decision. I knew I wasn't letting this poor girl go back out there, so I had to get the truth. There was something going on. I'll be right back. I found Jimmy in the hallway with their Aunt. Jimmy, can you come hold Daisy's hand for her? She's really scared. She waved us off without looking up. The moment we were alone, I asked him to tell me what happened. He had that same look in his.

My mom's this 4 11 woman who works at a library and knit scarves for charity. But I've watched grown men literally back away from her at grocery stores and cross streets when they see her coming. I found out why last week, and it's absolutely terrifying. When I was 8 years old, some punk teenager kept breaking into cars in our neighborhood. Hit everyone's car multiple times over several months, stealing whatever he could find. Phones, wallets, who's change, anything valuable left visible. This kid was relentless. Didn't care about security cameras or motion lights. Just kept coming back, night after night, like some kind of criminal ghost. One night around midnight, he smashes my mom's passenger window with a crowbar and steals her entire purse. Inside was $800 in cash, a rent money that she just withdrawn from the bank. Also her credit cards, driver's license, house keys, work badge, everything important. We called the police immediately and filed a report. The cops were sympathetic, but said there was nothing they could realistically do. No cameras caught his face, no witnesses saw the break in, no fingerprints on the glass. Just another case number. My mom just nodded politely and thank the officers for their time. She seemed unusually calm about losing $800. Three days later, she spending every afternoon at the library after work, researching on computers for hours, printing out pages of documents, making dozens Of phone calls, taking detailed notes in that tiny, precise handwriting. Turns out she'd figured out who the kid was from security footage at a nearby gas station. Cross reference time stamps. Tracked his route backwards. Found his social media from a partial license plate reflection. Found his address, full schedule, friends, family members, job. Everything about his entire life. But here's where it gets absolutely insane. During her investigation, she discovered his mom was having a full blown affair with their neighbor three houses down. Hotel meetings twice a week.

My whole family is watching, and some of them are even laughing like it's some cute family moment. He picks me up and throws me straight into the deep end. I hit the water and immediately panic because my hearing aids are getting soaked. I scramble to get out as fast as I can, but it's too late. They're completely fried. When I climb out, dripping wet, my perfect hair is ruined and I'm furious. Blake is cracking up, laughing with everyone else. I pull out my hearing aids and they're dead. Completely dead. Blake, you just destroyed my hearing aids! I tell him. He stops laughing for like two seconds and goes, oh, whoops. Didn't know you had those things now. When I tell him they cost $6,000 and he needs to replace them, his face goes white. Then he starts getting defensive. No way I'm paying that much. That's insane. Why would you wear those near a pool anyway? I explain that I wear them everywhere because I need them to hear. Wasn't like I was planning to go swimming. But he just keeps making excuses and acting like it's somehow my fault. My family immediately takes his side. They keep telling me to just let it go because Blake's broke. He was still in college working some crappy call center job. His girlfriend just had a baby, and they're living in this tiny apartment.

Everyone thought I hit the Jackpot. When I started dating Elias, he wasn't just any doctor. He was young, successful, and his dad literally sat on the hospital board. My parents were obsessed with him. They called him doctor perfect behind his back and brag to everyone at church about their daughter dating such a catch. What they didn't see was how he treated me. When we were alone, Elias timed my meals like I was some kind of patient. He'd check his watch when I ate and tell me I was going too fast or too slow. He criticized how loud I talked, saying doctor's wives needed to have appropriate volume control. Every Sunday morning, he made me step on his fancy digital scale for my health and would write down the number in this little notebook. Even corrected how I held my fork at dinner, repositioning my fingers like I was 5 years old. I thought it was just because he cared about me looking good in front of people. My friends said I was lucky to have someone who wanted to help me improve myself. But then my dad had a heart attack on a Tuesday night. Mom called me crying, saying they were rushing him to the ER. When I got there, guess who was on call. Elias. Mom grabbed my arm and whispered, it's a sign from god that He's here to save your father. Elias took charge immediately, which should have been comforting, but something felt off about the whole thing. He seemed too prepared, too calm. Like he already knew what was wrong with my dad. When I asked questions, he brushed me off with medical terms I didn't understand. Dad got better after a few days, but I couldn't shake this weird feeling. I started going through his medicine cabinet, just looking at all the pill bottles. That's when I saw it. Elias's name on three different prescription labels from the past.

Little boy with two dads. One crossed out with angry black scribbles. That's when I remembered the parent teacher conference from last week. His teacher had mentioned they were doing family tree projects. My son had gotten unusually quiet after that. I sat him down that night and asked about the drawings. He burst into tears, saying the kids at school told him I wasn't his real dad because he was adopted. That his real dad was out there somewhere and that's who belonged on his family tree. I hugged him tight and grabbed his art supplies. Together, we drew a new family tree. Instead of a regular tree, we made a giant heart with branches growing out of it. See, I told him, some families grow from hearts instead of trees. He hung that drawing in his room last week at school. He proudly presented it, explaining how love makes a family, not DNA. His teacher called me later, crying, saying three other adopted kids in different classes had asked to Redo their projects the same way. Sometimes the smallest hearts teach the biggest lesson.

He Said she's not my type. I was both touched and impressed.

How did you get back at a horrible customer? I worked at Rosie's Diner for almost two years, saving up for college. Most customers were decent, but this one guy named Doug made my shifts hell. Every Tuesday at lunch, he'd show up with his work buddies, acting like he owned the place. Doug would snap his fingers at me, complain about everything, and never left a single little tip. Not even a quarter. The worst part? He'd mock me in front of his co workers. Called me sweetheart in this condescending way. Once I brought the wrong salad dressing, and he literally rolled his eyes and said, loud enough for everyone to hear, can't even handle ranch dressing? Good luck in life. His buddies would laugh. I'd smile and apologize because I needed this job. One Tuesday, Doug came in extra loud. He was bragging about some presentation he gave. When I took their order, he mumbled something about no onions on his burger. Kitchen was slammed, so when his food came out with onions, he lost it. Are you kidding me right now? Do I need to spell everything out for you? His voice carried across the whole restaurant. I apologized and got him a new burger. But while I was walking back to their table, I heard one of his co workers, Amy, whisper to another guy, he's always like this. It's embarrassing. That caught my attention. Amy seemed uncomfortable. Every time Doug went off on Me. After they left with their usual zero tip, I had an idea. I remembered Doug mentioning he worked at Fletcher Marketing down the street, so I did some research. Turns out Fletcher Marketing was hosting a big charity event next month at our restaurant. They were bringing in potential clients to show off their company culture. I wrote an email. Not some angry rant, but a professional complaint with specific dates and examples of Doug's behaviour. I sent it to Fletcher's H R. Department, explaining how their employees conduct might reflect poorly on their company, especially with the up

After forgetting my ninth birthday completely, they swore they'd make it up to me. Invite five friends. Mom said. We'll handle everything else. I spent the whole morning decorating our backyard by myself. Made these crappy paper signs that said happy birthday, Jason in crayon, set up plastic chairs in a circle around our picnic table. I even found streamers in the garage from some party years ago and hung them up. My friends started showing up around noon with wrapped presents and confused looks. Tommy came first, then Alex, then Kevin and his little brother. They kept looking around like they were missing something obvious. Where's the cake? Tommy asked after we'd been playing tag for, like, 20 minutes. I smiled and tried to sound confident. My mom's bringing it. She went to get the good kind from the bakery downtown. But an hour passed. No food, no music, no parents anywhere. The boys were getting restless, digging through our kitchen cabinets looking for snacks. I found a bag of stale chips and some crackers, but that was it. When are they coming back? Alex asked, checking his watch. Soon, I kept saying. They said they'd be back before noon. It was almost three in the afternoon. That's when Kevin's mom showed up early. Pick him up. She Walked into our backyard and found me sitting alone under the tree, watching my friends kick a soccer ball around. Hey, sweetie, is your mom inside?

While my wife is breastfeeding our daughter. My mom has always been one of those people who just can't keep her mouth shut. Like, she'll comment on everything from the way I fold my laundry to how long my grass is getting. But when my wife Emma gave birth to our daughter Zoe three months ago, my mom somehow got even worse. Emma was already dealing with all the normal new mom stuff. She was exhausted, emotional, and trying to figure out breastfeeding while her hormones were all over the place. The last thing she needed was my mom's commentary about literally everything she was doing wrong. According to her expert opinion, it started small. Mom would come over and make little comments about how Emma was holding the baby or how often she was feeding her, why the house looked messy. Emma would just smile and nod because she's way nicer than I am, but I could see it was wearing her down. Then last Tuesday, my mom came over unannounced, like she always does. Emma was on the couch feeding Zoe, looking tired as hell, but happy. She'd been up most of the night because Zoe was going through a growth spurt and wanted to eat constantly. My mom walked in, took one look at Emma, and said, oh, honey, when's the last time you showered? You're starting to smell a bit Ripe. Emma's face went bright red, and she just stared at the floor. I felt my blood pressure spike, but before I could say anything, my mom kept going. I mean, I know breastfeeding is hard work, but you really can't let yourself go like this. The baby can smell it, too, you know. It's not healthy for either of you. Emma got up without saying a

So I'm going through this absolutely soul crushing breakup with my boyfriend of three years. You know, the kind where you can't eat, can't sleep, and your friends are tired of hearing about it. I start going to this 24 hour diner at like 2:00am because I literally cannot sleep. It's one of those old school places with cracked vinyl booths and fluorescent lights that make everyone look dead. First night, I order coffee and pancakes and just sit there scrolling through my ex's Instagram like the masochist I am. The waitress, this woman in her 50s with kind eyes, just keeps refilling my coffee without saying anything. Second night, same thing. Third night, she finally asks, rough patch, honey? I nod and try not to cry into my syrup. By the end of week two, I'm there every single night at exactly 2:00am. Same booth, same order, same pathetic scrolling routine. That's when she sits down across from me. Alright, sweetie, you've been here 14 nights straight crying into pancakes. What's his name? And I just break. I tell her everything. How he cheated, how he moved in with her immediately, how all our mutual friends picked. She listens to every word while bringing me free pie. The next night, she introduces me to the cook. Hank, this is Pancake Girl. She's having serious boy troubles. Hank, this massive guy with tattoo sleeves, looks at me and Goes. What kind of idiot breaks a heart like that? Then he makes me these incredible chocolate chip pancakes shaped like a heart. Soon, the whole night shift knows my business. There's Madison, the other waitress, who gives me brutal but honest dating advice. Cameron, the dishwasher, who barely speaks English, but always pats my shoulder and says, no cry, Mija. Even the manager, Frederick, starts checking on me.

No. Can I go to bed now? She practically ran to her room. Before I could follow, my phone buzzed with a text from my other foster son, Jason. Is Lily okay? She was crying in the bathroom earlier. Do you know if anyone's been bothering her? No, but she's been acting weird, like, really tired all the time. The next morning, the school nurse called while I was at work.

She told me they happened at home. I'm required to document this. The threat hit me like ice water. They thought I was hurting her. I'll need to file a report with child services. Someone will be contacting you within 72 hours. After hanging up, I sat in my car shaking. Three foster kids under my roof, and now I was being investigated. They could take all of them away. That night, I watched everyone like a hawk. Jason was doing homework. My youngest foster daughter, Kia Was coloring. Normal evening, except Lily kept nodding off at dinner. Didn't you sleep well? I asked. I had weird dreams, she mumbled into her Mac and cheese. What kind of dreams? She shrugged and asked to be excused two days until the home visit. I found pine needles in Lily's hair while braiding it, which made no sense since we lived in a suburban neighborhood with only oak trees. Were you playing in someone's yard? No, but her hands twisted her rabbit's ears nervously. Jason pulled me aside that night. Something's up with Lily's window. I followed him to her room, where she

Je suis en col√®re contre lui, mais aussi perplexe devant la r√©action de maman. C'est juste la r√®gle stupide de la casquette. Pourquoi ? S'englotte-t-elle. Ma s≈ìur me prend √† part plus tard.

That's when she completely broke down and confessed everything. She'd faked the entire kidnapping.

All because she couldn't face failing my class and losing her scholarship. The administration was furious. Suspended her immediately. Talked about pressing charges for filing false reports, wasting police resources. But I asked to see her paper first. Couldn't help my curiosity about what drove a kid to such extremes. What I read blew my mind. 47 pages of brilliant analysis connecting Cold War propaganda techniques to modern social media manipulation. Original research, primary sources. I'd never seen students use arguments so sophisticated. They belonged in graduate school. This girl understood desperation and manipulation better than most political science professors. She'd lived it for one terrifying night. I stared at that paper for hours. Technically, she missed the deadline. School policy was clear, but she demonstrated more understanding of historical context through her actions than most students showed in their writing. The irony was perfect. A paper about propaganda written during an act of propaganda. I gave her an A. Quietly, never announced it. She graduated with honors by half a point, kept her scholarship, never spoke about what happened again.

The whole town was looking for this girl. Her mom was on the news, begging for her safe return. Even I felt sick, thinking something terrible happened to one of my students. Twenty four hours passed. Nothing. Then suddenly, around six PM, Rebecca was found behind some dumpster at a gas station 20 miles away. She told police this wild story about being grabbed by some random guy who panicked and let her go. But things felt off immediately. Zero injuries on her body, no defensive wounds. Her phone records showed it never actually left the city limits. Most suspicious part was security footage from near her last known location.

Then three months after her funeral, I got a Bill in the mail addressed to her estate for eight hundred forty seven dollars and fifty cents from Sunset Manor Care Facility.

She very matter of factly explained that the charge was for post residency room cleaning and restoration services. I was confused. What exactly does that mean? Janet cleared her throat and said, well, when residents pass away, we have to thoroughly sanitize and restore their rooms for the next occupant. It's quite an extensive process. I asked for an itemized breakdown, thinking maybe they'd had to replace furniture or something. What I received in the mail two days later made my blood boil.

My siblings and I always joked about how none of us looked anything like our dad. It was just a silly family joke and we all laughed about it. But one day, our youngest sister saw a DNA test kit on sale, and she suggested we finally settle the question of who was really dad's kid. We thought it was funny, so we agreed to do it just for fun. None of us had any doubts or suspicions because we were sure it would just be a laugh. I'm the oldest of four siblings, two boys and two girls. My youngest sister had always been the favourite, and our parents worked hard to give us everything we needed, even when money was tight. We all took the DNA test while laughing the whole time, making dumb bets and teasing each other. Then we sent off the samples and forgot about it for a few weeks until my phone buzzed with the results. I opened the email expecting something funny, maybe even a confirmation that we were all just being dramatic. But my smile disappeared right away. Out of the four of us, only our youngest sister was actually related to our dad. At first, I thought it had to be a mistake. There was no way this could be real. I stared at the screen for a full minute before I even moved. My hands were shaking as I called my siblings Into the room and showed them the results. My brother said it had to be wrong and suggested we take another test. No one argued. We all needed to believe it was a fluke. So we did. We went to a different place for testing and waited nervously, each day dragging longer than the last. That second test felt heavier, like we were waiting for a sentence. When the second results came back the same, we knew our lives had changed forever. We went to our mom, hoping for answer.

So my girlfriend Amy had this cookout planned with her friends, and honestly, I was dreading it. I mean, she's way out of my league. Like, this girl could be a model, and I'm just some regular dude who works at an auto shop, but whatever. I figured I'd try to make a good impression. Her friends showed up around 2 p m, and right away I could tell they were the type who thought their shit didn't stink. Designer clothes, fancy cars, the whole deal. I'm out there grilling burgers in my regular jeans and a band T-shirt, trying to be friendly, asking if anyone wanted drinks or anything. That's when Amy started in on me. First it was about my hairline. Oh, Jake's going bald already, and he's only 24, she said while laughing with her friend Madison. I just stood there flipping burgers, pretending I didn't hear it, but my face was getting hot. Then she spotted my tattoo when I rolled up my sleeves. Yeah, his buddy Tyler gave him that masterpiece in his garage. Real professional work, right? The tattoo is pretty shitty, I'll admit that. But hearing her tear it apart in front of people who barely knew me was rough. When I grabbed a beer around 4 p m, she goes, better make it a light one. Jake's a total lightweight. He'll probably be passed out by 8:00. Her friends were eating this up, giggling like we were in middle school or something. The worst part came when one of her friends asked about my truck. Before I could even answer, Amy jumps in with, oh, that piece of junk? It barely runs. I keep telling him to get a real car, but you know how?

I spent two weeks quietly packing during lunch breaks, found a perfect place near the river, transferred my lease, changed my address with work, updated my voter registration, forwarded my mail, the whole nine yards. My parents and Jennifer had absolutely no idea. Great, I said, standing up and wiping barbecue sauce from my hands. You can drop them off at my place tomorrow morning around 9. I'll be completely ready. Jennifer's face lit up like Christmas morning. Really? Oh, my god, thank you so much. I knew you'd come through for family. Mom started tearing up. You're such a good sister, Laura. I gave them my old address with a straight face. You know, the completely empty apartment I'd already vacated, the one with the bright for rent sign posted in the front window. That night, I turned off my phone completely and enjoyed my first peaceful evening in my beautiful new place. I ordered pizza, unpacked my last moving box, and watch Netflix without any guilt or interruptions. The next morning, Jennifer showed up at my old apartment complex with three enormous duffel bags, car seats, toys, snacks, and a huge, excited smile. She knocked on the door for 10 solid minutes before my former landlord, Mister Peterson, came out. Can I help you with something? He asked. Lately, I'm looking for Laura Mitchell, she said, balancing four year old Sophie on her hip. While Emma and Jake ran circles around the parking lot screaming, oh, she moved out two weeks ago. Nice girl. This unit is available if you're interested in renting it. My phone started absolute we blowing up around noon when Jennifer finally made it back home with three confused, cranky kids. 12 missed calls, 37 increasingly frantic text messages. Where the hell are you? What kind of sick joke is this?

You won't mind, will you? They smiled like it was already decided. My sister Jennifer sat there twirling her hair, scrolling through dating apps, not even looking at me, while her three kids demolished my parents living room. It's just temporary, mom said, cutting her steak like we were discussing weekend plans, until David gets comfortable with kids being around. So let me get this straight. Jennifer wants to hide her three children from her new boyfriend, dump them with me for months, and I'm supposed to pay for daycare while she plays house? You don't understand what sacrifice means. Dad jumped in, waving his fork. Dramatic. Automatically, Jennifer's given up everything for those kids. The audacity was absolutely unreal. Jennifer had been pawning her kids off on everyone for years. Last month she dropped them at our cousin's wedding reception and disappeared for the entire party. The month before that, she left them with our 80 year old neighbor, Missus Chen, while she went clubbing until 3:00am. Two months ago, she dumped them on me for a girls weekend that turned into five days. I nodded and kept eating my ribs and calm. Sounds like you've got it all figured out. The thing is, Jennifer finally looked up from her phone, eyes sparkling with greed. David's got serious money. Like country club money. I already Told him I don't have kids yet. Just need a few months to ease him into the idea of family life. And you'll somehow manage Emma J. And Sophie during the day while you're working full time? Mom asked me directly. Like I wasn't even there to speak for myself. Oh, I figured Laura could find a babysitter. Jennifer shrugged casually. I'll be pretty tight on cash with David moving in. His place is expensive to maintain, so I'd be paying for full time childcare for kids that aren't.

In that moment, my wife had declared me an unfit father in front of my son's teacher. I didn't react. I just smiled quietly and sat through the meeting. But something inside me died and was replaced by cold resolve. I wasn't just leaving her. I was taking my son with me. Using her own cruelty to do it. I hired Marcus Thorn, the most aggressive family attorney in the city. I drained my savings to pay his retainer. He was blunt. Judges hate parental alienation. But you. I need proof. Hard, undeniable proof. So I became a spy in my own home. I bought voice recorders and placed them in the kitchen, living room and Leo's playroom. It was legal, since I was part of the conversations in my own home. The evidence I gathered was sickening. A kitchen recording where Leo asked about his history project.

Nothing fancy, just two days of doing absolutely nothing with people who act like putting frozen waffles on a plate is a full meal prep routine. So Saturday rolls around, it's five thirty PM. I haven't eaten since noon. The house smells like someone burned a candle next to a microwave dinner. I figure, okay, we're probably about to eat soon, to be clear, I asked this so politely, like peak non threatening tone. I walk up to Tessa and go, hey, do you know what time dinner is? Not make me dinner, not I'm starving and your house smells like depression. Just a simple question. Civilized, friendly. She freezes, looks at me like I just asked her to twerk on me and to solve world hunger with two spaghetti noodles and a paperclip. Then she says, and I quote, why do you always assume I know things? I blink. What? She's pacing now. Pacing in her socks, clutching a throw pillow, like she's about to monologue about betrayal in a Netflix original. I say, sorry, I just meant, like, are we ordering food? Cooking? Is someone bringing something? Like, just curious. She goes, yeah, well, maybe next time ask the ceiling, because clearly I'm just the girl who always knows stuff. Ma'am, I asked what time the nuggets arrived. You're acting like I forced you into an unpaid therapist position then, because this couldn't possibly stay normal. She flops onto the couch, stares at the ceiling.

After around 10 minutes of him being calm and saying things like it's okay baby, just let me finish this game, I will get punished if I leave and her just not understanding, she issued an ultimatum if you don't turn that game off right now and take me to dinner, I'm leaving. He just typed in chat pause please. Need to break up with my GF and everyone laughed and paused. Dude just went ballistic. This is my apartment. You stay here on my dime. I buy you all your food. I give you money to go shopping. You don't get to issue ultimatums to me when you don't have anything without me. Get out of my apartment! This relationship is over. Then it was lots of her crying and yelling and bringing up all the things he did wrong in the past as if that was going to help. Eventually he just said sorry, the relationship is over, I don't care. Bring a truck and one of those douchebag bar guys you love to fuck so much to get your stuff tomorrow. See if any of Them are willing to clothe, feed house, and fuck you. Everyone on voice chat just went oh! And we were typing everything that was happening to the enemy team. He eventually got her out of the apartment, and boy, did it sound like the guy had a world of pressure off his shoulders. After the game, I friended him. We still talk on steam sometimes.

His friend never made a move because she was into him instead, the guy was deep into his story when she walked in, stunning in a little black dress and high heels. They greeted each other with a kiss and took tequila shots together, the banter quickly heating up. Out of nowhere, he whistles at me like I'm a dog and says, Yo man, more shots. Disappointed, I pour them and let him know I'm not a dog. He brushes it off, saying, just keep an eye out, we're gonna get lit. As the night goes on, he gets louder, laughing at his own jokes and talking over the girl. Then he announces he needs to pee on a rock and stumbles to the back. The girl looks mortified, texting furiously. He returns with another guy, not fully drunk but well on his way, and makes an offhand comment before stumbling outside. His friend follows, leaving the girl alone. Five minutes later, the friend returns, says he put Bob in an Uber, and takes the girl to dinner. But thirty minutes later, Bob walks back in sober, apologizes for whistling, and buys us a drink. He admits he played the fool on purpose so his friend could save the day. He's better for her, he said She's not my type. I was both touched and impressed. Fathers. What moment made your life fall apart? I knew something was wrong when my son stopped showing me his artwork. Every day after school, he used to run to me with his drawings, proud of each messy masterpiece. Then suddenly, nothing. At first, I thought maybe he'd lost interest in art. But one day, I was cleaning his room and found them. Dozens of drawings stuffed under his bed. All of them were of the same thing. A little boy with two dads. One cross.

My fiance said, thinking I'd raise another man's child. But she. I'm a 28 year old union electrician making decent money. I've been with Britney for three years. When she got pregnant seven months ago, I proposed the day she told me. Because that's what you do when you're about to be a dad, right? Something felt off from the moment I proposed. She wasn't excited. More like she was doing me a favor by saying yes. But I pushed down those gut feeling. I've been covering everything since she got pregnant. Doctor visits, baby gear, her rent when her nail salon income dropped. Plus her health insurance. Nearly $8,000 so far. Plus the 4,200 dollar engagement ring. She always mentioned this personal trainer, Derek, from her gym, claiming he was just helping with prenatal exercises. Something about how she talked about him always bothered me. Then came the afternoon that changed everything. I got off work early and decided to surprise her with dinner from that expensive sushi place she loved. I let myself in and heard voices from the kitchen. I was about to announce myself when I heard her talking to her sister Ashley. I still can't believe you're actually marrying him. Damien's got great insurance and steady money, but girl, you're really settling. Derek can't provide what this baby need. Britney replied, Damien can. My blood went cold. I Guess Damien's okay, Ashley continued, but you deserve better than some electrician who thinks Applebee's is fine dining. Britney laughed. I care about him enough. And honestly, he's so desperate to play hero that he'll never question anything. He just nods and pays for whatever I want. For 15 minutes, I stood frozen, listening to them plan my future like I was an ATM with legs. How she'd keep seeing Derek after we got married. How Derek didn't even know the baby was his. How they'd already coached Ashley on what to say if I got suspicious. Just when I came home later, she was acting completely normal, showing me baby monitors, talking about honeymoon plans, asking if I was excited about becoming a daddy. I needed evidence. Started recording conversations, since our state allows one party consent. When she left her phone unlocked during a shower, I found months of messages between her and Derek, planning their future together, discussing how they'd manage things after my wedding. She literally called me the bank in one message. But here's the kicker. She'd been lying to Derek, too. She told him she was on the pill and the pregnancy was an accident. This woman was playing everyone. I got a prenatal paternity test through my doctor. The result? Zero percent chance I'm the father. Last night, I took her to Romano's, where we had our first date. She thought I was planning some romantic surprise. Britt, I need to ask you Something straight up. Is there anything about this pregnancy you haven't told me? Pure panic flashed in her eyes before she slipped into innocent girl mode. What do you mean? Babe, I know about Derek. I have the paternity test results. I know the baby isn't mine. She stared at me. Then the fake tears started. Some sob story about it being just. Just one mistake when we were fighting about money. I've seen the messages, I said. I heard you talking to Ashley. The mask came completely off. The crying stopped, placed by a cold look I'd never seen. You went through my phone. You recorded me without permission. You were planning fraud and you're worried about privacy? Then she said the line that will haunt me forever. Even if the baby isn't biologically yours, you're still going to be his father. Like it or not. We're getting married in two months. I'm not letting you ruin our family over some stupid technicality. A tech technicality. She called paternity fraud a technicality. There's not going to be a wedding, Brittany. She lost it screaming in the restaurant about how I was abandoning my responsibility. Other customers stared. The manager came over. You think you're so smart, she hissed. Good. Good luck finding someone else who will put up with your boring ass. Just a blue collar worker with a truck payment. I walked out while she was still screaming, drove straight to the wedding venue and canceled everything. Lost The 2,500 dollar deposit. But it felt like the best money I'd ever spent.

He'd done months of research and knew exactly what parts he needed. Sales guy took one look at my son's wheelchair and started talking to me instead. Sir, maybe we should look at pre built systems. They're much simpler. My son pulled out his carefully organized parts list, but the guy wouldn't even look at it. These high end components are very complicated, he said, still ignoring my son. Maybe something more basic would be better suited for his situation. My son, who'd been building computers in his head since he was 12, finally had enough. My situation?

I teach high school Spanish, and last semester a student named Tyler didn't show up for his oral presentation. Instead, he sent an email with a video attachment claiming he was stuck in Mexico after a family emergency. The video showed him stranded at a Mexican beach, apologizing in Spanish for missing class. Behind him were palm tree, crystal blue water, and a sign that said ply a Cancun. It was actually pretty impressive. He'd even thrown some Mexican coins on the table next to him to sell the story. But there was one problem. I could see his bedroom poster reflected in his sunglasses. Instead of calling him out, I replied with my own video, speaking entirely in Spanish, of course. I congratulated him on finding such a nice beach and mentioned how amazing it was that he'd managed to find the only Cancun beach with a target shopping cart in the background, which was visible in the reflection of his window. I ended by assigning him an extra credit project, a presentation on the difference between Mexican beach is and the local lake where he'd actually filmed the video. He showed up to class the next day with a full Powerpoint comparing them. Now he helps run the Spanish clubs weekly movie nights, where we sometimes watch his travel video for laughs. When he finished, he closed the panel, wiped his hands on his jeans, And said should run fine now. The bearings might need replacing next year, though. That night, my brother in law called to invite us to his son's basketball championship. He couldn't resist adding, bring Avery, too. Maybe he'll finally get interested in something besides books.

Max's overnight bag was packed with it, stuffed elephant and three days worth of clothes. Missus Chen, my 70 four year old neighbor, met us at her door in her bathrobe. She spoke broken English but hugged Max like he was her own grandson. Don't worry, she whispered to me. I take good care. What was supposed to be a routine appendectomy turned into a nightmare. Internal bleeding kept me unconscious for eighteen hours. When I woke up, machines were beeping and tubes were everywhere. The surgeon explained I need to stay at least six days for monitoring. My phone had dozens of missed calls, but none from family. Instead, there were voicemails from Mrs. Chen and her careful English. Max eating good breakfast. He helped me water plants. He very Good boy. Day three, I was finally stable enough to Facetime max, sitting at Missus Chen's kitchen table, carefully folding dumplings with tiny fingers covered in flour.

That same day, my phone rang. Hospital administration. Mr. Rodriguez, your mother called demanding to speak with your doctor about visiting hours. She was quite insistent about getting details regarding your condition. When we explained you've been here since Monday with complications from emergency surgery, she became extremely upset.

Mom had apparently brushed it off, saying I was being dramatic about a minor surgery and that I was probably partying or dating someone new while Mac stayed elsewhere.

He was sitting at her kitchen table, carefully practicing writing Chinese characters she taught him. When he saw mom and Amber, he politely said hello, then turned back to his paper. Missus Chen is teaching me to write thank you in Chinese, he explained. Seriously. She says it's important to say thank You to people who help you. Missus Chen stood actively near Max, her small frame somehow intimidating as she faced my family. In her careful English, she said, this boy very good. He helped me. I helped him. He not cry one time for papa. Very brave. Mom tried to explain they'd rushed back as soon as they heard, but just looked confused. But Daddy told me you were on an important trip.

I worked at a memory care facility when I witnessed something that still haunts me. There was this resident, Dorothy, 82 years old, with mid stage alzheimer's. Every day at three PM, she'd wait by the window, convinced her son Bradley was coming to visit. She'd put on lipstick, fix her hair, and clutch this little photo album she kept hidden under her mattress. Bradley hadn't visited in two years, but Dorothy didn't remember that. Every day was the first day of waiting for her. One Tuesday, Bradley actually showed up, not to visit, but with a lawyer and a real estate agent. They needed Dorothy's signature on papers to sell her house. I watched from the hallway as he walked right past the recreation room, where his mother sat in her usual chair, wearing her good dress, photo album in her lap. The administrator called Dorothy to the office. When she saw Bradley, her whole face transformed. You came. I knew you'd come. She reached for him, but he stepped back, gesturing to the lawyer to explain the documents he needed her to sign. Papers she couldn't possibly understand, using medical terminology about her diminished capacity, while she sat there smiling at her son, asking if he'd like some of the cookies she'd saved from lunch. But here's the part that broke me. Dorothy started showing Bradley the photo album. Pictures of him as a baby, at graduation, his wedding, She narrated each photo with perfect clarity. Moments from decades ago preserved while yesterday vanished. This is you at the beach. You. We're scared of the waves. But I held your hand. Bradley wasn't even looking. He was texting on his phone. When she got to a photo of them at Christmas, she started crying. I'm sorry. I can't remember things anymore. I try so hard. Are you disappointed in me? Bradley finally looked up, annoyed, and said, mom, just sign the papers. She signed everything. Seven documents giving Bradley full control of her.

They took my brother shopping for school clothes instead. Your birthday can wait, mom said. It never got rescheduled. By high school, the pattern was set. He'd break something, blame me, and I'd get grounded. He failed every class, but got a BMW for his 18th birthday. I was valedictorian and got a card. They skipped my graduation because he felt left out and needed a beach day. I stayed home during college to save money, working two jobs while finishing my degree. Every morning, my brother would jingle his BMW keys at me. Still taking the bus. Loser. After six months of overtime shifts, I finally had enough for a down payment. My friend's dad owned a used car dealership and cut me a deal on a blue Dodge Challenger. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. First thing I'd ever owned that my parents hadn't touched. I parked it in the driveway that night, put the keys on my dresser, and took about 50 photos. Even posted one on Instagram with the caption earned, not given. Next morning, the keys were gone. So was the car. So was my brother. He probably just borrowed it, mom said, not looking up from making His favorite breakfast. You know how boys are. He stole my car. Family doesn't steal from family. Three hours later, I heard the engine. My brother pulled up in my challenger. Except the front bumper was dragging, the passenger mirror was gone, and there was a crack. Spider webbing across the windshield. He tossed me the keys. Your car is junk, bro. Fell apart on the highway. You should get your money back. I stared at the damage. You crashed it. Prove it.

You're taller, way better than my boyfriend. The crowd cheered. I just left. The next morning, she realized she'd lost more than just me. My girlfriend Maya had this male best friend, Eric, who was always around, always touching her arm, always looking at her like she was his prize. Six months earlier, I'd laid it out clearly. Either put serious distance between you two, or we're done. She cried, promised he was just a friend. And for months, things seemed better. Then came the concert. I busted my ass to get expensive tickets to her favorite band. It was supposed to be our date night. We get through the gates, and the first person I see is Eric, standing there with this smug grin. What's he doing here? I asked, not hiding my irritation. Maya went defensive immediately. Oh, my god, Leo, don't start. He got a ticket from a friend. It's total coincidence. The look Eric gave me, that little victorious smirk, told me everything. This was no coincidence. This was a setup. She lied to me and broken the one promise I'd made. A deal breaker. But I paid for those tickets, so I decided to just ignore them. Stupid plan. Because it's. Maya. And Eric had other ideas. They were all over each other the entire time. Whispering, laughing at inside jokes I wasn't part of. She was putting on a performance. And I was the chump in the background. I wasn't her date. I was just the guy who drove her there. When the headliner came on, the crowd surged forward and Maya started complaining she couldn't see Leo. Let me get on your shoulders, she said, like nothing was wrong. You know I have a bad back. I told hold her, suggesting we move to the side instead. She gave me a five second pout, then turned to Eric with that bright fake smile. Eric will do it. He's strong. Just like that, he's crouching down and she's climbing onto his shoulders. The crowd around us, a bunch of drunk kids, started cheering. She was loving it, playing to them, living her main character moment. And she looked down at me. Since Eric's a few inches taller, she was really looking down. She laughed this loud, ugly sound that cut right through me. See? She shouted, making sure everyone around could hear. You're taller, way better than my boyfriend. The crowd roared their approval. Eric just stared at me with that same mug, punchable face. He'd won. That's when everything went quiet for me. The music, the crowd. Everything just faded. It was this cold, hard clarity hitting me like a freight train. This was it. The final line. I didn't get angry, I didn't yell. I just.

Making a fool of me on another man's shoulders in front of thousands of people. And I smiled because I was done. I turned and walked away. The crowd parted like they could feel the energy coming off me. I didn't look back once I walked out of that venue into the cool night air and felt nothing but relief. The taxi ride home was the best 45 minutes I had in months. My head was completely clear for the first time in ages. I got I back to my apartment, my name on the lease, my furniture, and shot the deadbolt. Then I packed every single thing she owned, used her expensive luggage, did it properly. By midnight, it was like she'd never lived there. Around 2:00am, I heard them stumbling and laughing outside. Her key scraped the lock, then hit the deadbolt. Banging started. Leo let me in. The door stuck. I didn't move. Just watch them on the doorbell camera. Eric trying to shoulder the door like some tough guy and bouncing off like an idiot. Finally, she called my phone. Leo, what's wrong with the door? Nothing's wrong with it. It's locked. I'll unlock it. No! Silence! What do you mean, no? I mean you don't live here anymore, Maya. You found someone way better, so you can go live with him. Your bags are packed. Have a nice life. I could hear Eric yelling in The background. She started sputtering about how I was breaking up with her over a joke. You broke up with us? When you lied to my face and brought him to the concert, I said the rest was just you confirming my decision in front of a few thousand people. I hung up and blocked both numbers. Eventually, they gave up and left. Watch them go on the camera dragging her luggage down the hallway. The next morning, I moved everything to the building's hallway and sent an anonymous text. Your things are in the hall. Six months later, I haven't heard from her since. Their relationship imploded within weeks. their whole dynamic was based on him being the exciting alternative to me. Once I was gone, they had nothing to rebel against. Maya had to move back with her parents without me funding her lifestyle. Eric became the local joke after getting knocked out defending his girl. I saw her recently working as a waitress. When I was on a date, she turned white and immediately left her shift.

Get out before I drag your black ass out, he said, while already opening my door. And keep your hands where I can see them, or things will get real bad real fast. Got out slowly, because I've seen enough videos to know how this goes with cops like him. He immediately started destroying my car like a wild animal looking for food. You people are all the same, he said, while throwing my stuff everywhere, acting innocent. But I know you're dealing or stealing. He actually pulled out a knife and started cutting my seats open looking for hidden substances. Your kind is why I became a cop, to protect real Americans from animals like you. What this racist trash didn't know was that I was actually a federal agent. I've been working undercover for six months investigating him. Fifteen black families had filed complaints saying Owens planted evidence to arrest innocent people. One kid jumped off a bridge after Owens framed him and he lost his full ride to college. Another family became homeless fighting fake charges that Owens laughed about. In the station, I had cameras in my earring, my necklace, and even my shoes, recording everything. The investigation team was watching from A van two blocks away. He was about to find out that his most famous arrest would be the one that destroyed him. Owens grabbed his radio and called for backup. I've got a violent black female. She is acting aggressive and probably armed. I literally hadn't moved or said anything. Three cop cars came flying in with sirens, screaming like I was holding hostages or something. His partner Garrett jumped out already pointing his gun at my face and yelling, is this the substance dealer? They always made stuff up like this. Yeah, she matches the description perfectly. Owens lied. Dark

Mom chose her boyfriend Rufus over me when I was 16. He claimed I stole his Rolex, which was ridiculous since he pawned it weeks earlier for casino money. Rufus gave mom an ultimatum that night. Either she goes or I go. Mom didn't even hesitate. She packed my clothes and trash bags while I was at school and changed the locks. When I got home, my stuff was on the lawn getting soaked by sprinklers. I spent three weeks sleeping in a 24 hour laundromat. The owner eventually caught me, but instead of kicking me out, he offered me a job cleaning his other properties. That's how I met Mister Thief, a 73 year old man who was more powerful than I could have thought. His daughter had died at 17 in a car accident years earlier. When he found me scrubbing his toilets at 2:00am for grocery money, something in his eyes changed with in a month, he moved me into one of his vacant luxury condos. Not some rundown unit, but a penthouse he usually rented for $5,000 a month. Mr. Thys brought me dinner every night, helped with homework, and taught me the property business. When other kids were learning to parallel park, I was learning to negotiate lease agreements and manage construction crews. He paid for my prom dress, my college tuition, even walked me down the aisle at my Wedding for five years. He was the father I never had. When he died of a heart attack, he left me everything. 47 rental properties worth $18 million. I was 21 and suddenly one of the largest property owners in the city. I tried reaching out to mom once during those years. Invited her to my high school graduation. She never showed. Drove by the house one Christmas Eve and saw her through the window laughing with Rufus. I knocked for 10 minutes. She looked right at me through the glass and closed the curtain. Mom's sister called me when I was 25. Said mom and Rufus were begging family members for money again, asking if I had anything to spare. They've hit up everyone.

My dad died believing I was in federal prison. That's what my stepmother Veronica told him during his final week in hospice care. She had convinced the hospice staff I was dangerous and shouldn't be allowed to visit. I found out because a nurse broke protocol and called me after dad died. She said Veronica had been telling him for weeks that I was in prison for fraud and couldn't come see him. The truth was I lived 20 minutes away and had been calling the hospice daily begging to see. Two weeks before he entered hospice, while he was still confused from pain medications, Veronica got him to sign a new will. Everything went to her. The house, his plumbing business, 400,000 in savings. All of it. At the will reading, the lawyer said, everything goes to my wife, Veronica. My son gets nothing because he betrayed my trust. I tried to fight it, but my lawyer said without proof of coercion, I had no case. Cost me 5,000 just to hear that. Within a month, Veronica sold dad's plumbing business for cash. While I was sleeping in my car, she posted photos from Miami with her trainer. While I work double shifts at a warehouse. She bought a seventy thousand dollar Mercedes. While I saved every penny. For three years, she was burning through dad's money on failed boutiques and younger boyfriends. I watched It all on social media. The shopping sprees, the ages, the parties. She went through 100,000 in the first year alone. Meanwhile, I bought my first condemned property for 30,000 using a hard money loan. Spent six months fixing it myself after my warehouse shifts. Kept it for 60. Used the profit to buy two more, started renting them. Year 5, she was selling dad's house to cover debts. Year 7, her latest boyfriend cleaned out her accounts and disappeared. Year 8, she had to take a retail job. By year 10, I own 22 rental properties, bringing in 300,000 annually. She was folding clothes at minimum wage. I built everything from nothing, while she destroyed everything.

A spider had taken priority over their son's cardiac emergency. We called exterminators, but none can come until tomorrow. She won't stop throwing up. I woke alone in the ICU at 2:00am. No family, no flowers. My parents chose pest control over their dying son. The night nurse found me staring at the ceiling. Families usually camp out here. Where's yours? I explained the spider situation. Her face shifted to, I've seen families drive through hurricanes to get here. Never seen someone choose a bug over their child's heart surgery. That's when I called my lawyer, Tony, at 5:00am. I need some paperwork. Big changes. Tony arrived looking like he'd thrown on yesterday's clothes. I gave him the full story. His jaw tightened. This explains so much. We spent Three hours going through my finances. The joint savings account I'd set up for their emergencies showed $125,000 in withdrawals over five years.

Do you remember my college fund? I asked. That was a long time ago, mom said uncomfortably. You took $75,000 that grandpa left for my education and spent it on Jessica's failed marriages, then called me selfish for being upset. You turned out fine, dad said. You have a good job, a house. I turned out fine despite what you did, not because of it. Two weeks ago, they called again. We're losing the house. Jessica's lawyer says Travis might owe her money from their divorce. We just need $10,000 for the retainer. Even facing homelessness, they were still looking to extract money from Jessica's failed relationships instead of making her take responsibility. You want me to pay for Jessica's divorce? Lawyer? It would be a loan, mom said quickly. 28 years. Jessica's needs came first. Her wedding dreams over my education. Her crisis over my future. You never once asked how I was doing, only called when you needed money for Jessica. You're our son, too, mom said. Then treat me like it. Stop seeing me as Jessica's backup funding source. Long pause. So we're on our own? You're exactly where I was when you took my college money. You'll figure it out. Take out loans, work extra hours, make sacrifices. You'll be fine. We're too old to start over. I was 18 when you made me start over. You'll manage. Yesterday, my aunt called. My parents filed bankruptcy and moved to a small apartment. Jessica's staying With friends. While looking for work. She's thinking about community college. Student aid is complicated when you're over 30. She might need help with application fees. Jessica has had plenty of chances. All funded by my parents, retirement, and my college money. At some point, she needs to create her own chances. You've gotten hard. I've gotten realistic. There's a difference. Last week, Jessica called me directly for the first time in three years. Her voice was smaller than I remembered. I know things are messed up between us, but I

It started with a pizza. Like most tragedies, we were at a casual little team bonding night that was less bonding and more let's all pretend we're friends so we don't get passive aggressively fired next week. They ordered three large pizzas. One pepperoni, one veggie, one pineapple, because apparently someone in HR hates. Now, there's an unspoken law when it comes to communal food. If you're not in the room when it arrives, your slice becomes part of The Hunger Games. That's not rudeness. That's survival. That's etiquette. That's biology. So when I walked into the break room and saw one last slice sitting there alone, looking sad, abandoned, practically whispering, take me, I took it like any good citizen of earth would. I folded it like a New Yorker with childhood trauma and took a bite. Then he walked in. Chris from sales. A man whose entire person Mellody is just protein powder and Bluetooth headsets. He entered the room like he just returned from a battlefield. Hair wind blown, shirt unbuttoned at the top like he'd fought a lion. On the way in, he froze when he saw me and the pizza. The room dropped 10 degrees. His eyes locked on mine like I had just eaten his first born. He goes, you. You ate it? And I, stupidly trying to be friendly, said, oh, yeah, hope that wasn't yours.

Brooke herself, sobbing. Vanessa, I already hired caterers. I sent embossed invitations to the senior partners. They think I own a lakefront estate. You don't own anything, Brooke. I do, but this will ruin my career. These people are expecting elegance and sophistication. Maybe you should have thought about that before uninviting the person who actually owns the house. Beautiful part. Brooke had already booked the catering, hired servers, ordered custom linens. She'd positioned herself as the hostess of this prestigious lakefront estate, probably bragging about her family's success to colleagues for weeks. Now she had 30 days to explain why she was suddenly homeless. Next text was desperate. Vanessa, I'll pay you back. I'll get a loan. With what credit score, Brooke? After you destroyed mom and dad's? I booked my ticket to Bali that afternoon, first class. Naturally. The money I'd saved from not having to support Brooke's lifestyle anymore was finally working for me. The irony was perfect.

I'd be watching sunsets over the Indian Ocean. My phone kept buzzing with increasingly frantic family messages, but I was already mentally checked out. Then came the final text from Brooke.

Look, I love my family, but hosting Thanksgiving for five years straight has turned me into their personal servant. Last year was when I finally snapped. My sister Jen showed up three days early with two suitcases like she was moving in. She immediately claimed my couch, turned on Netflix, and announced she was on vacation mode. My brother Rick brought his twin boys, who are 7 and treat my house like it's Chuck E. Cheese. The first morning, I woke up to find chocolate fingerprints on my white walls and goldfish crackers ground into my carpet. When I asked Rick to clean it up, he just shrugged and said, kids will be kids. Then my mom arrived with a list of everything wrong with my house. The guest towels weren't fluffy enough, the dining room needed better lighting. She even made me drive to three different stores to find the exact cranberry sauce she wanted. But the absolute worst part was the Thanksgiving night. After I spent eight hours cooking a Turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, green bean casserole, and two pies, everyone ate and immediately scattered to the living room. I'm talking dirty plates everywhere, gravy spilled on my good tablecloth, and Turkey bones just left sitting there. My husband Jake and I cleaned for three hours while everyone else watched football and complained that the TV was too quiet. Next morning, Rick's Kids ate the entire leftover pie I was saving for Jake's parents who were coming that weekend. When I got upset, Jen rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic over dessert. That's when I lost it. I told everyone they needed to leave by noon, that I was done hosting. Fast Forward to this year in September. I told them I needed a break and suggested we rotate hosting or go to a restaurant. Mom immediately said my house was the most comfortable and I was being selfish. Jen said her apartment was

She'd laugh, ruffling my hair. But then it got weird. She started saying it more seriously when she had to work late again and missed my school play.

I just replied. Noted. That was the night they realized I was done being taken for granted. I'm Vanessa, 32, software engineer. Six months ago, my parents nearly lost their lakefront house because my golden child sister Brooke, racked up massive debts on their credit cards. Who did they call? Me. I liquidated everything.

Brooks really blossomed into such a sophisticated woman. You understand, right? Brooke? The same sister who called me jealous when I asked about the $15,000 she borrowed last year. The same one who maxed out Mom's credit cards on networking trips to Cabo. But they didn't know about the paperwork my lawyer made them sign when they were desperate. The loan agreement with very specific terms they'd forgotten about. I opened my laptop and typed one word in the family chat. Okay. Then I called my attorney, Steven. Start the proceedings. They have 30 days. The next morning, I woke up to 17 missed calls. Brooks hysterical voicemail was The Vanessa? What is this? Eviction notice? This is my Thanksgiving dinner. I already sent invitations. Mom's text came next. Sweetie, surely we can work this out. Brooks worked so hard planning this event. Hard work? That's rich coming from someone who spent the last six months shopping with money she didn't earn.

Growing up, there was just one rule in our family, blood is thicker than water. It was drilled into us at every family gathering. We had these massive Sunday dinners at my grandparents house every month with like 30 people showing up. And every single time someone would ask where cousin Jamie was, the answer was always the same. Oh, you know, Jamie, always working. I was 28 when I ran into Jamie at the grocery store. First time I've seen her in 13 years. She went completely pale when she saw me and tried to leave, but I grabbed her arm and insisted we get coffee. I mentioned how my five year old daughter loved art just like Jamie used to. That's when she broke down. She grabbed my hands and begged me to never let my daughter near the family gatherings. Then she just ran out before I could ask why. I couldn't stop thinking about it, started noticing things I never paid attention to before. Old family photos on my, my mom's mental had weird gaps where someone had been cropped out. Jamie's name never came up in stories about the old days. When I asked my mom about it, she got all defensive and said Jamie made her choice to abandon the family. But that didn't make sense because I remember for Jamie being the star student with a full scholarship to art. School. Then Uncle Rob got drunk at my parents anniversary party and let something slip. He said Jamie destroyed our family with her lies. My mom shut him up real quick, but I saw the look they exchange. I found Jamie on social media and begged her to tell me what happened. She didn't want to at first, but when I sent her a picture of my daughter, she finally agreed to meet. We sat in her car outside of Starbucks and she told me everything. Uncle Mark had been molesting her since she was 8 years old. Uncle Mark, who everyone loved. Uncle Mark, who was my grandparents golden child. She finally told her parents when she was 15 and they called a family meeting. My grandparents accused her of trying to destroy the family, said blood is thicker than water and she needed to think about what she was doing to everyone. Her own mother coached her, take it back, asked if ruining everyone's lives was worth it. The worst part was that other cousins had come forward privately and admitted it happened to them too. But they were too scared of losing the family to say anything publicly. When Jamie refused to recant, they branded her a liar and an attention seeker. They literally erased her from the family, removed her birthday from the calendar and edited her out of photos, told everyone she declined her scholarship and ran away. I remembered being 15 and my parents. Telling me Jamie was sick in the head, I believed them. Everything started clicking into place. Uncle Mark always volunteered for kid duty at gatherings. He'd offer to babysit my daughter. Last month, I discovered three other female cousins had mysteriously moved away over the years. Found my Aunt Sarah's number and called her. She confirmed her daughter was a victim, too, and the family forced them out when they wouldn't stay quiet. The thing that really got me was realizing Uncle Mark basically owned everyone. He paid for my grandparents medical care and had given loans to half the family for their businesses. My own parents had borrowed 50 thousand from him to save their house during the recession. That's when my daughter made a comment that made my blood run cold. She said Uncle Mark's games were weird. I found old home videos and sure enough, there he was, always positioned near the young girls, always finding reasons to be alone with them. The next family gathering, I showed up late and couldn't find my daughter anywhere. Panic started rising as I searched room after room. Then I saw Uncle Mark's study door was locked. I heard my daughter.

How did it go? I used to date these super loud guys who would flirt with waitresses and talk over everyone at dinner. After my last boyfriend made me cry in a Taco Bell parking lot because he was texting other girls, my co workers at the bank kept telling me I needed to try something different. They all kept pointing to Owen from I T. Mid thirties. Always wore these soft sweaters, never raised his voice at anyone. He was the guy who held doors open and offered gum to random people. Everyone loved him because he literally never said no to helping anyone with their computer problems. So after weeks of my friends bugging me about it, I asked him to grab coffee. He got this huge smile and said yes immediately. Our first few dates were like something straight out of a romance movie. He brought me daisies because I mentioned once that roses felt too fancy. He walked me home even though his car was parked the opposite direction. He texted me good morning and good night every single day without fail. But after about three weeks of dating, something started feeling weird. Not anything he did exactly, but what he didn't say. Like I realised he never talked about himself, ever. I would ask about his childhood and he'd smile and change the subject to asking about mine. When I asked about past relationships, he'd just say nothing. Worth remembering. And immediately asked me about my ex boyfriends. It wasn't sketchy exactly, just really empty. Then came the night I was supposed to meet his friends. We planned to meet at the sports bar downtown. I showed up on time, but only Owen was there. He seemed totally normal about it and said his friends had to cancel last minute. We just had a quiet dinner instead. But then it happened again the next week and again. Every time we were supposed to meet his friends or family, something would come up. When I finally asked him directly about his family, he just said they were complicated and left it at that. I started getting curious, so I decided to Google him. One night there was nothing. Like, weirdly nothing. No Facebook, no LinkedIn, no Instagram. I even tried searching his name with our city and his workplace. Nothing came up except basic work directory stuff. That seemed really strange for someone our age, so I decided to do something I'd never done before. The next time he came over, I waited until he was in the shower and opened his laptop. It wasn't even password protected, which should have been the first red flag, but what I found made my stomach drop. There were hundreds of folders on his desktop. Each one was labelled with a girl's name. Some had full names, some just first names. I opened a few of them randomly. Each folder had screenshots. Of social media posts, selfies, pictures from what looks like dating apps, even some photos that looks like they were taken without permission. Then I saw a folder with my name on it. I clicked it, and my hands started shaking. There were dozens of photos of me that I had never sent him. Some were screenshots from my social media, but others looked like they were taken through my apartment.

My ex wife gets our daughter Haley every weekend. And every weekend, Haley comes home with a brand new injury. Bruised lip, scraped knee, even a cracked rib once. But the court's only response has been, children need their mothers. last week I was getting ready to go pick her up when I got the call. It was her friend's mom. Haley's at my house in Woodbridge for a sleepover and her insulin pump just fell. We don't know what to do. Her blood sugar is at 450 and climbing. I felt my stomach drop through the floor. That number should never be above 180. Where's her backup insulin? I asked, already grabbing my keys. She doesn't have any with her. Your wife dropped her off and said everything was in the pump. My hands were shaking as I started my car. My ex always carried the backup insulin in her purse. She made a huge show of it during custody hearings. Moving. What a prepared mother she was. I called her immediately. She answered with casino noise in the background. Haley's pump failed. She needs insulin now. You're only 15 minutes from the sleepover house. Yes, yes, yes! I just hit an all time record. She responded, our daughter is dying. I yelled, you need to leave now! There was a pause. I can hear dealer voices in the background. I'm at the high roller table. I don't care. What table? I'm down $3,000. I need to win it back. I slammed my hand on the steering wheel, pushing 90 on the highway. Our daughter is going to die. I'm 45 minutes away. You're 15. Then call an ambulance. They don't carry insulin. You know this. Only her prescription pen works. It's in your purse. I'm in the middle of a hand. Give me 20 minutes. Sleepover. Mom texted me a photo at 12:15. Haley unconscious on their bathroom floor, her lips pale, vomit on her shirt. The text said she's over 500 now, barely responsive. I called my ex again, screaming. Now she's dying. Dying? Get in your car. Stop being dramatic and stop calling. You made me lose that hand. The dealer thought I was cheating with signals. That's another 500 gone because of you. I hung up and called 9 1 1, explaining everything through tears. They said they'd meet me there, but confirmed what I already knew. Paramedics can't administer insulin without the pen. When I finally screeched into their driveway at 12:00am, the ambulance was already there. Haley was on a stretcher, completely unconscious. The paramedic looked grim. Blood sugars too high for our meter to read. We need insulin immediately. My ex has it. She's coming. But she wasn't. Not for another 42 minutes. I tried calling the casino directly. My daughter is dying. My ex wife, Rachel Beckett, is at your high roller table. She has life saving medication. Please make her Leave. Sir, we can't force guests to leave for personal matters. It's not personal. A child is dying. I'm sorry, sir. The paramedics arrived. I begged them to call her, thinking medical professionals would get through. The lead paramedic tried. Ma'am, your daughter is in diabetic ketoacidosis. Her organs are shutting down. I heard her response through his phone. I'm her mother. I'll decide when it's serious enough to leave. When my ex finally strolled through the emergency room doors at 1:00am, her designer purse was over her shoulder, reeking of cigarette smoke and wine.

I'm deaf and lived my whole life thinking my apartment was this peaceful, quiet space. Boy, was I wrong. I'm 24 and got my own place about two years ago. Small, one bedroom, nothing fancy, but it was mine. I loved how calm everything felt. My cat pepper and I had our routines down. I'd make tea every morning, watch Netflix with subtitles, do my thing. But here's the weird part. I could never sleep through the night like ever. I'd fall asleep fine around 11, then wake up at 2:00am sweating and anxious and again at 4, sometimes 5:30. Every single night for months, I check my phone, look around the room, everything seemed normal, but my heart would be racing like I just run a Marathon. My doctor said it was probably anxiety, prescribed me some sleep aids. That didn't do anything. My therapist thought maybe I had some deep childhood trauma, trauma messing with my sleep. We spent weeks talking about my past, but nothing clicked. It didn't feel like nightmares or panic attacks. It felt like something was physically wrong with my space. My cousin Zoe came to visit last month. She's hearing and was gonna crash on my couch for the weekend. She works at this marketing firm downtown and needed a place to stay while her apartment got fumigated. We've been texting about it for weeks. So she shows up Friday night around 8 with her overnight bag and some Chinese takeout. We're eating and catching up, talking about her job, drama and my new position at the graphic design company. Everything's normal. Then around 10, she starts looking around my apartment. Weird. Yeah. How do you sleep here? She asks, making this disgusted face. I'm confused. I signed back asking what she means. My apartment's clean.

I spent three years invisible at my high school. Not the shy kid who sits alone, but the one nobody remembers exists. Teachers called me by the wrong name. Kids borrowed my notes then forgot who gave them. Even the lunch lady skipped my tray sometimes like I wasn't standing there. So when I overheard two popular girls planning the senior prank, something inside me snapped because I wanted to join, but because their idea was weak, they wanted to fill the principal's office with balloons. That's it, balloons. Like we were still in middle school. I knew I could do better, so I started planning something that would make everyone finally see me. First, I got Jake involved. He worked at his uncle's print shop and owed me for doing his chemistry homework all semester. I told him I needed 500 copies of something but couldn't say what yet. He agreed without questions because that's how desperate he was to pass. I talked to Emma from theater. She had keys to the costume room because she managed props. I told her I needed to borrow something for one night. She handed me the keys and said, just don't get caught. The hardest part was getting into the school database. But my computer science teacher, Mr Lopez, had been using the same password for three years, football 2,019. I knew because he typed it in front of us every morning when he Logged in two weeks before graduation. Everything was ready. I stayed after school pretending to work on yearbook layouts. When the building emptied out, I went to work. First, I logged into the announcement system and recorded a new morning message. Then I printed all 500 copies. Every single one was a different embarrassing photo from the principal's Facebook. Him doing carry okay. Him wearing a banana costume at Halloween. Him crying at his daughter's wedding. But that wasn't the best part. Using the theater supplies, I made a perfect replica of our school mascot costume, except this one had the principal's face printed on the head. I hung it from the main hallway ceiling with fishing wire so it would drop during morning announcements. The next morning, I sat in homeroom trying not to smile. At exactly 8:15, my recorded message started playing over the speakers, but it wasn't my voice.

I was home alone one evening when the doorbell camera notification pinged on my phone. A FedEx guy stood on my porch holding a small package. Nothing unusual, just didn't remember expecting a delivery. I answered through the speaker. Just leave it at the door. Thanks. I looked directly into the camera. I need a signature for this one, ma'am. Through the doorbell camera, I watched him shift his weight. It'll just take a second, he insisted. That's when I noticed he wasn't holding a scanner. FedEx always has those handheld devices for signatures. This guy's hands were empty, except for my package. Who's it from? I asked, buying time while pulling up the actual FedEx tracking site on my laptop. No delivery scheduled for today. It's marked urgent. He said. Medical supplies. My heart started racing. I don't have medical conditions requiring special deliveries, but, I mean, it's just in my head, right? The driver knocked again, harder this time. Ma'am, I can hear you moving around in there. I hadn't made a sound. I was sitting perfectly still on my couch, phone clutched in sweaty hands. How did he know I was home? I tell him he's got the wrong address. He says, no, this is the right one. I messaged my neighbor, Mark, an off duty cop, I claiming to be FedEx at my door. No truck, no scanner. Says he can hear me inside. What do I do? He said he's at a grocery store and is heading over. I called him and said what's going on and please hurry cause I was scared. The man outside started trying the doorknob, gently at first, then with more force. Mark said, I'm calling it in. Stay quiet, hide and lock yourself. He hung up. The delivery man set the package down and pulled something from his back pocket. Through the camera, I watched him unfolding what looked like locked

My friend's girlfriend venmoed me $200 with a message. Brutally crush her heart for me. I accepted the request. I thought, wow, what a sick joke. About two weeks ago, at my friend's birthday party, his girlfriend Aria cornered me in the kitchen. Need you to date my roommate Amelia for exactly three weeks, then break up with her. She pulled out her phone and showed me a picture of the most gorgeous girl I've ever seen. Dark brown hair and eyes like sapphire. She's been obsessed with an ex who ghosted her six months back. I'm done watching her cry over a guy who doesn't deserve her tears. I'd rather she cry over a guy like you and move on quickly. Plan was simple enough. Make Amelia fall for me, then hurt her in a nicer way. A smaller heartbreak to get over the bigger one. I told her it was cruel, but she'd already written me a script with conversation starters and favorite books. I accepted to get her off my back and for the easy money. It wasn't hard to find her at the bookstore. Amelia sat directly beside the window, the light hitting her gently, highlighting the different hues in her eyes. She looked like a painting from a distance. Became the only girl to ever make me nervous. I walked over and smiled softly. Is this seat taken? She glanced up at me. Her smile Meeting mine clumsily, yes. I mean, no. Please sit. I watched her ears burn red. Cute. I pointed at the book in her hand. Also a fan of Rebecca Yarrow? She giggled. You know this is a romance book for women, right? I shrugged. Yeah, well, I like the dragons. That made her laugh harder, which made me feel relieved. Aria had sent me cliff notes late at night, and I'll be honest, I wasn't very good at memorizing, but I did remember seeing the word dragons. Rest of the book club date went smoothly, to the point where half of the time I wasn't acting, and we ended up staying in the parking lot talking until closing time. When Amelia mentioned her ex and got this sad look. It snapped me back. Right the favor, I thought. Feeling kind of disappointed almost. The second date felt dangerously real. I picked up Amelia from the book club on my motorcycle, putting on a worn leather jacket that had been hidden for months after my dad passed. She got on the bike full of fear and excitement, like kid on a field trip for the first time. Amelia screamed as I took her along the winding roads, and gasped when she saw the spot overlooking the city. They look like stars! She shouted. We both stared out at the twinkling view of the skyline. The sound of crickets around us made it feel like we were in our own world. It's Funny, I said, licking my lips anxiously. I don't usually bring people up here. She raised an eyebrow and jabbed me with her elbow playfully. Oh? And why is that? I shook my head at her tone and took in a deep breath. This is where I came after my dad died. He and I used to go on rides together up here for years. I turned away, fighting back emotions that I hid away carefully to protect myself. Amelia slipped her hand in mind and squeezed hard. It's okay. I'm glad I can share this with you. Noted. We spent another hour staring at the bright lights, talking about our family before heading back. Aria made sure to check in the next day. I don't know what you're doing, but it's working. She's looking happier than ever. Her words didn't make me feel good. It made me nauseous with guilt instead. And it made me think about how I go through with the final date. The night before then, Amelia showed up to my place, saying, I'm sorry if this is going to sound crazy, but I couldn't say it over the phone. I'm in love with you, and I hope you are, too. She stood at my doorway, fidgeting and breathing heavily from her nerves. I had never felt more happy and heartbroken at once. I'm sorry, but I don't feel the same way, I said through my teeth. I tried to close the door, but she stepped Her foot through to stop me. But what about the things before? I shook my head and looked away, doing my best to keep things together. I thought I could handle your baggage, but you're exhausting. My tone felt scripted, but I had no choice. She needed this. Aria had said so. Every time you talk about your ex, I realize you'll never be over them. Amelia looked at me, pain apparent across her face. You know what? You're right. I was too much. Too much for someone who's emotionally vacant. At least my ex had the decency to just disappear. Not this performative. Cruel. I watched her run down the hallway of the apartment, wiping tears from her eyes. I slammed the door closed, regret flushing over me. I didn't deserve her anyway. I tried to convince myself. Three days later, we both showed up at Aria's apartment to return the money. Aria smiled awkwardly. She pointed at us. I paid you guys for the same thing. Look, Aria was hurting over an ex, and you were hurting over your dad. And I thought, hey, what better way to not feel hurt than love, right? We glared at her while she backed into A. Amelia and I stared at each other in silence until she asked quietly, so you don't like dragons? I burst out.

I never thought anyone would be good enough for my daughter. Call it overprotection or just a father's instinct, but Lily was my only child and I'd seen her heartbroken too many times before. When she first mentioned Marcos, I barely paid attention. Another name and a string of boyfriends who wouldn't last. But then months passed. She kept talking about him. I started to worry. He's coming for dinner next Friday, Lily announced one evening, not asking but telling. My wife squeezed my hand under the table, a silent plea to behave. Fine, I muttered, but I'm grilling steaks my way. Marcos arrived 15 minutes early with a bottle of wine and a firm handshake. Strike one, too eager to impress. Throughout dinner, I watched him carefully, waiting for the mask to slip. He laughed at my jokes, complimented my wife's cooking and asked thoughtful questions about Lily's childhood. Too perfect. Nobody is that genuine. When Lily mentioned her car was making strange noises, I saw my opening. I'll take a look at it tomorrow. I offered. Actually, Marco said, I'm pretty good with cars. My dad owned a garage and I work there every summer through college. Strike 2, trying to one up me in my own house. After dinner, I suggested we move to the porch for drinks. My secret weapon was always the porch, where potential boyfriends inevitably revealed their true selves under my scrutiny. Sir Marcos Said quietly when Lily and my wife were inside.

My Japanese grandmother called me bakachan from the day I was born. I thought it meant little treasure or precious jewel in Japanese. She would pat my head and say bakachan with such warmth in her voice. I felt like the most special grandchild in the world when she said it. In fourth grade, I did a family tree project explaining how bakachan was a sacred Japanese term. It showed how much my grandmother cherished me above all her other grandchildren. My teacher, who I now realise spoke Japanese, kept making strangled noises and spilling her coffee. I thought she was just emotional about my beautiful cultural presentation. I begged my parents for a bakuchon themed birthday party. We had custom napkins printed with Wakachan Sweet 16 in Japanese characters. The Japanese bakery tried to refuse our order three times. They kept suggesting alternatives like birthday girl or literally anything else. Mom had to pay triple to convince them. For my 18th birthday, I got bakuchan tattooed on my wrist in beautiful Japanese characters. The tattoo artist, clearly Japanese, made me sign five different waivers. He kept muttering in Japanese and showing me pictures of butterflies and cherry blossoms instead. I insisted on bakuchan because I wanted authenticity. He took photos of the consent forms while shaking his head. My college application essay is centered around being called bakuchan and it meant to me I Wrote about how this precious nickname connected me to my Japanese heritage. I explained how it represented unconditional love and acceptance in Japanese culture. I got into several schools and was convinced my touching essay made the difference. Freshman year, I decorated my dorm room with a giant neon sign saying Baku Chan's Palace in Japanese. My Korean roommate took one look and immediately requested a room transfer. When I explained the beautiful meaning, she just patted my shoulder sadly and doubled her transfer request. I assumed she was intimidated by my cultural authenticity. I joined the Asian Student Union and introduced myself as bakachan. At every event, the Japanese exchange students would freeze and then whisper frantically to each other. One girl actually laughed out loud before her friend elbowed her hard. they were impressed by how connected I was to Japanese traditions. My boyfriend got property of bakachan printed on a hoodie for Valentine's Day. His Japanese roommate saw it and laughed so hard he needed his inhaler. When my boyfriend wore it to the International Student Mixer, the entire Japanese Student Association took group photos with him. I thought they were admiring our cross cultural romance. Junior year, I finally got to study abroad in Tokyo. At customs, I proudly declared Watashi wabakachandeisu. The officer dropped his stamp and called his supervisor over. They had a heated discussion in rapid Japanese while staring at my passport. I assumed they were by my perfect pronunciation. I made Friends with a girl who seemed constantly on the edge of telling me something. She'd start sentences, then stop herself and shake her head. One day she asked.

In my family, the eldest daughter was expected to raise every child born after her, not help with, not babysit, but become their actual mother from the moment they arrived home from the hospital. I changed my first diaper when I was 6 years old. You see, my mother was a former teen mom who treated pregnancy like catching a cold, something that just happened to you. My father worked construction, but somehow his paychecks always disappeared into new tools or nights at the bar. They both came from huge families where this was just how things worked. By the time I was 8, I had three siblings under my care. My parents would leave for their date nights while I heated bottles and rocked crying babies. Soon you'll get married and pass the burden onto someone else, my mother would say each time she announced another pregnancy, her eyes landing on me like I was hired help. Fast forward eight years later, when I turned 14, my mother sat me down at the kitchen table with this formal announcement. She was pregnant again. Nothing new, except this time she handed me a notebook labeled Household Schedule with my name listed as primary caregiver from 6:00am to eleven PM your old enough to handle night feedings alone now, she said. My father nodded from his recliner. We cancelled your after school activities. Family comes first. The worst part was when they told me I need to get a work permit to buy diapers because they couldn't afford extras. They called it giving me real world experience. This is what love looks like in our culture, they said. You're so much better with them than we are. My day started at 5:00am, making breakfast for four kids while my parents slept in. I fell asleep during a parent teacher conference. Once my parents told everyone I must be partying. The youngest started calling me Mama at the grocery store and people would give us looks. Came the breaking point. I'd worked so hard to get a full academic scholarship to my dream college. The acceptance letter arrived on a Tuesday. For once, I wasn't an underage mother. I was just Lisa, a normal girl going to a normal college. I was in the middle of happy tears when my mother walked in. I'm pregnant, she yelled. My face dropped. It was twins. That was the same week that my dad decided to be even more neglectful than usual. I had to be the one to hold my mom's hair when she vomited, to massage her feet to fix her pregnancy cravings, all while taking care of the kids. The counselor called the next week saying I needed to submit final paperwork by three PM the baby got sick and wouldn't stop screaming. I missed the deadline by 10 minutes. The scholarship was withdrawn for lack of commitment. My parents said college would have been Selfish anyway, I started planning my escape in secret, applied to community college and got accepted. Got a part time job at a grocery store and hid my money in a tampon box. My 16 year old sister Sarah found out but promised to keep quiet. For once, everything was going according to plan. And so my parents found the acceptance letter I'd hidden in my chemistry textbook. My mother cried about all their sacrifices. My father threatened to kick me out if I abandoned the family. I didn't say a word. And the next day I came home from work to find the house riddled with social workers. Apparently my parents told them I was the neglectful caregiver who was supposed to be watching everyone. The social worker saw through it but gave me an impossible choice.

I was 20, working graveyard shifts at a 7 11 when I got slammed with a 1,200 dollar DUI that would destroy my entire life. The citation claimed I was driving drunk at 3:00am on Saturday, weaving between lanes and refusing a breathalyzer test. One problem. I don't drink alcohol. I'm a recovering addict who's been sober for three years. Officer Thompson wrote that he pulled me over outside Miller's Bar on Fifth Street. He claimed I reeked of alcohol, had bloodshot eyes, and failed every field sobriety test. But I was restocking energy drinks at 7 11 during my overnight shift. My register transactions showed I sold $847 worth of merchandise between 3 and 4 a m. The security cameras captured me behind the counter at the exact time he claimed I was drunk driving. I couldn't afford a lawyer. A DUI conviction would mean losing my license, my job, and probably going back to jail. So I printed everything. Work schedules, register logs, security footage, time stamps, even my three year sobriety chip. I. I practiced my defense speech until my hands stopped shaking. This was life or death. The courthouse reeked of desperation and broken dreams. I watched person after person accept plea deals for things that would ruin their lives. When they called my name, Officer Thompson walked up looking like he'd done this a thousand times. He was massive, intimidating, with dead eyes. And a bored expression. Your honor, I observed the defendant's vehicle swerving erratically on Fifth Street. Upon contact, the and exhibited classic signs of intoxication. Slurred speech, alcohol odor, bloodshot eyes. He became combative and refused all sobriety tests. Combative? I was working at 7 11, Officer Thompson. When it was my turn, I started carefully. Officer Thompson, what kind of car was I driving? He looked confident. Blue Ford sedan. Your honor, I don't own a car. I've never owned a car. I take the bus to work every night because I can't afford insurance.

I thought it would be a nice little snack to eat while going through the day and finishing my homework and studies. When I took the first bite, it tasted good, but then.

Growing up wealthy, I never let anyone forget where I stood. Every time someone asked for a loan, every time a friend suggested I pay for dinner, every time a girlfriend lingered too long at the jewelry store window, I had my guard up. My parents would tell me to stop being so cynical, but I'd just shrug and remind them about Vanessa, the last girl who sued me for a fake engagement ring. When I was 28, my dad threw me in for a whirlwind. We were at the country club when he announced he'd arranged my marriage to Christina, the niece of his new business partner. Mom clasped her hands together, excitement brightening her face. She's lovely. She's an elementary school teacher and comes from a very traditional family. Dad nodded. The merger depends on this union. I met Christina two weeks later. Beautiful, yes, but from a family that lived in a two bedroom apartment, Christina wore the same dress to three different meetings. Her phone screen was cracked. She public transportation. Every alarm bell in my head went off. Even worse, the wedding happened fast. We prepped for three months and she refused every expensive option. The simple flowers are prettier, she'd say. I don't need a designer dress. I assumed she was playing the long game. I had to give her credit. It Was a smart move. Act humble until the papers were signed. After the honeymoon, I started my tests. I left my Amex black card on the kitchen counter for a week, but it went untouched. So I suggested we go shopping for her new wardrobe. I have enough clothes, Christina said, heading to her teaching job at 6 a. M. I offered to buy her a car. She said the bus ride was convenient and he liked reading during the commute. Two months in, I took things a step further. I brought her to the Cartier store for our anniversary. Pick anything, I said. Watching her face carefully, Christina held my hand and pulled me out. Let's get ice cream instead. There's a place nearby that makes it fresh. We spent $20 total. My business partner couldn't believe it when I told him. She's good, he said over drinks. But they all crack eventually. my ex wife acted sweet for two years before the spending started, I decided on the ultimate test. Six months into our marriage, I came home looking devastated. I sat her down and held her hands. The investments crashed. We lost everything. The house is being foreclosed. The cars are being repossessed. We have maybe 10,000 left. I watched her face, waiting for the disgust, the anger, the quick. Is it a plan? Christina pulled me into her arms. It's okay. We'll figure it out. My teaching salary can cover a small apartment. You're brilliant. You'll rebuild. She spent that night making budget spreadsheets, looking up affordable neighborhoods near her school, calculating how to stretch her 35,000 salary for two people. The next morning, Christina called her principal to ask about summer school positions. For extra income, she canceled her gym membership.

My mom had this absolutely insane rule, no music above whisper volume anywhere in the house, ever. Not in our bedrooms, not in the basement, not even with headphones if she could hear the faintest sound leaking from the hallway. We had to keep everything so quiet that my friends thought our house was like a library or a museum. My sister would literally hold her phone directly to her ear to listen to songs. I got in serious trouble once for humming the frozen soundtrack too loudly while doing homework. She made me sit in silence for an hour as punishment. This went on for 12 entire years, 12 years of basically living in complete silence like monks. Then my boyfriend came over for dinner last month. He asked if he could play some background music on his phone while we cook together. I automatically said, oh, no, absolutely not. We can't have music on in this house. He looked completely confused. Why not? It's just background music. I shrugged like it was obvious. Mom's rule, no music above whisper level anywhere in the house. He stared at me like I just said we weren't allowed to breathe oxygen. That's really weird and kind of concerning. Why would that be a rule? I realised I'd never actually questioned it in my entire life. We just accepted it as absolute fact, like gravity or paying taxes or for the sky being blue at dinner. He asked my mom. Directly, Missus Chen, can I ask why music isn't allowed in your house? I've never encountered this rule before. The whole table went completely quiet. We never questioned Mom's rules ever. That was just asking for trouble. Mom looked genuinely puzzled. What do you mean the no music rule? Why can't there be any music played in the house above whisper volume? Mom's face went completely blank. What no music rule? I don't have a no music rule, my sis.

So I became the emotionless void she asked for. I've been with Danielle for two years and never imagined she'd humiliate me at my dad's funeral right there in the church while I cried during my uncle's speech. Stop being such a fucking pussy, she hissed in my ear while I cried. Real men don't cry like little bitches at funerals. She said it loud enough that my aunt turned around. You're embarrassing me in front of everyone and making my pussy drier than sandpaper. Couldn't believe what I was hearing. Danielle, my dad just died 3 days ago. That's why you need to grow some balls. She was getting louder. Your dad would be ashamed watching you cry like a girl on her period. My grieving family was now staring at us. You seriously want me to stop being sad at my father's funeral? Oh, my god, you're so dramatic. She rolled her eyes. This is why I can barely get wet anymore. You're always acting like such a woman. I slowly wiped my last tear and stared at her with dead eyes. Fine. You want no emotions? You got it. She smiled and patted my cheek like I was a dog. Good boy. Now you're finally acting like a real man instead of a whiny little girl. A few days later, she got promoted and started screaming with joy. She was jumping around our apartment waving the email on her phone. I'm the new general manager, she squealed. Three years of ass kissing finally paid off. We need to celebrate. I looked at her with absolutely zero expression on my face. Okay, I have received this information. She stopped bouncing immediately. What? That's it? She looked genuinely confused. You said emotions are for pussies. What? What the hell are you talking about? Her face was scrunched up trying to understand. This is the biggest moment of my career. You said real men don't have feelings. I reminded her flatly, emotions make you dry. Remember? She threw her phone on the couch. Really frustrated. Whatever. You're being weird. The next day, her sister announced she was pregnant at a family dinner and everyone was crying happy tears. Her sister ran over to hug me after showing us the ultrasound. We want you to be the godfather, she said excitedly. No, thank you, I said, with.

When my daughter was 16, she got rear ended by a drunk driver while stopped at a red light. The guy was clearly wasted, failed three sobriety tests. But somehow his expensive lawyer was trying to blame my daughter for the accident. The crash left her with a concussion and whiplash. She he missed two weeks of school and had to quit her job at the local coffee shop because she couldn't handle the physical demands anymore. But this lawyer was determined to prove she was somehow at fault. During the deposition, he kept asking the same questions over and over, trying to confuse her or get her to contradict herself. My daughter has always been sharp, but head injuries can affect your memory. So I was worried about how she'd handle his aggressive tactics. The lawyer starts with this condescending tone. Now, Miss Johnson, you claim you were completely stopped at the intersection, correct? Yes, sir. The light was red. But how can you be absolutely certain you were stopped? Isn't it possible you were still slowing down? Because my car has something called brakes and I use them. The stenographer smiled, but the lawyer wasn't amused. He kept pushing. You were on your phone at the time of the accident, weren't you? No, I wasn't. Come now, you're a teenager. All teenagers are on their phones constantly. Surely you were texting someone. I wasn't on my phone. I Find that very hard to believe. What teenager isn't on their phone while driving? That's when my daughter looked him dead in the eye and said, the kind whose parents actually taught her how to drive responsibly. Maybe if more adults acted like adults instead of getting drunk and driving into teen, we wouldn't need to have these conversations. The room went completely silent. The lawyer's face turned red, but he kept going. Let's talk about your alleged injuries. Concussions are very convenient because they're impossible to prove, aren't they? Actually, they showed up on my CT scan. But I'm not a doctor. Are you? I'm asking the questions here, young lady. Right. But you just asked me if concussions are impossible to prove. And I'm telling you mine was proven by medical imaging. So either you don't understand how CT scans and work or you're asking questions you already know the answers to just to waste everyone's time. Our lawyer was trying not to smile. The other guy was getting flustered. Miss Johnson, isn't it true that you've been milking these so called injuries for attention and to get out of school? Yes, because nothing says fun teenage experience like massive headaches, memory problems and having to quit the job I loved. I definitely gave myself a concussion just to miss my AP chemistry test. The sarcasm was thick and even and the court reporter was stifling a laugh. But the lawyer wasn't done. He pulled out a photo On his phone and showed it to her. This is a picture from your Instagram account posted 3 days after the accident. You're smiling. If you were really injured, would you be posting happy photos? My daughter looked at the photo, then back at him with this completely deadpan expression.

I replied, okay. When they tried to log into the company servers the next day, they realized the family business was built entirely on the code I had just revoked. I, 28, male, just got the most hilarious text from my brothers. After 5 years of building what they called the family business, they've decided to vote me out. My brothers, Garrett, 35, and Toby, 32, started a logistics company consulting firm in 2019. What they actually had was a fancy name, business cards and exactly zero clients. Six months in, they came crawling to me fresh out of college with a comp computer science degree. They needed someone to handle the website. What they actually needed was someone to build an entire automated system from scratch. Client portal, inventory tracking, route optimization, payment processing, the works. Took me 8 months of nights and weekends. They paid me in pizza and promises. Here's the thing, I never transferred ownership of the code. It's all licensed through my personal LLC. They I signed without reading because we're family. Fast forward five years, we're pulling in $2.8 million annually. My systems handle everything. They just shmooze clients and collect checks. Last week, things got interesting. Garrett's wife Mallory suddenly became operations director, a made up position where she reorganizes filing cabinets and changes email fonts. Toby's girlfriend Kelsey became social media manager for our B2 B company that doesn't even Need Instagram, both making DOLLAR85K annually, by the way. Meanwhile, I'm still maintaining every line of code, updating systems, handling server crashes at 2:00am, and taking my measly 20% cut as the tech guy. Yesterday at four PM, hey, we held a partners meeting and voted, you're out. The business needs to evolve beyond just tech stuff. Pack your desk by Friday, we'll mail your last check. Hey, thanks for everything, I replied. Okay. Then I did what any reasonable person would do. I logged into AWS and revoked every single license key for their software. All of it. The client portal, routing system, inventory management, payment processing, everything. Now it all shows one simple message, license expired. Please contact your software administrator. Garrett called me at four seventeen PM, then 4:19, then 4:12, missed call. By 4:30, I didn't answer any of them. The chaos that followed was honestly better than Netflix. Their biggest client had a 400,000 dollar shipment scheduled for the next morning. Without the routing system, they had no idea which drivers were supposed to go where the inventory system was down, so they couldn't figure out what was supposed to be. Garrett showed up at my apartment at 6:00am, pounding on the door like police. I recorded it through my ring doorbell but didn't answer. He screamed for 20 minutes about how I'm being petty and destroying the family business. My neighbor eventually threatened to call the cops, so he left. Then came the lawyer. Threats. Toby sent me this gem. Our attorney says what you did is illegal sabotage and corporate theft. You have.

I said nothing and revealed what she'd hidden for years. When I was 19, my mom remarried Richard and suddenly decided I was too spoiled living in our family home. Time to learn independence, she said, kicking me out so Richard's son Tyler could have my room. My childhood bedroom became his gaming setup overnight. I'll never forget packing my stuff while Tyler lounged on my old bed, already planning where to put his new desk. Mom stood in the doorway with her arms crossed, explaining how this would build character. The same woman who used to make me hot chocolate when I had nightmares with now treating me like a burden she couldn't wait to get rid of. I crashed on couches for months. My friend Jake's mom let me sleep in their basement, but I felt like such a charity case. I worked three jobs. Morning shift at a coffee shop, afternoons at a retail store, nights doing delivery driving. I'd see families eating dinner together through restaurant windows and feel this hollow ache in my chest. Mom would post family vacation photos with Tyler in my old spot at the dinner table. Disney World trips, beach houses, fancy restaurants. Tyler wearing my old high school Letterman jacket in one photo. Really stung like I never existed. The worst part was running into them at the grocery store. Mom would get this awkward smile and ask how I was doing out there in the real world while Tyler stood behind her wearing brand new clothes. Meanwhile, I'm calculating if I can afford name brand pasta sauce. This week, I finally saved enough to rent a tiny studio apartment above a pizza place. The walls were thin, it smelled like pepperoni constantly, and the heat barely worked, but it was mine. I'd fall asleep listening to Tyler's Instagram stories about his awesome new room and best mom ever. During this time, I was the only one who visited grandma regularly. Every Sunday, I bring her groceries and we'd watch old movies together. She never asked why I looked so tired or why my clothes were getting loose from skipping meals. She just made sure I ate a real dinner every week and sent me home with leftovers. Grandma would tell me stories about growing up during the depression. How her family stuck together no matter what. Real family doesn't abandon each other when times get tough, she'd say, patting my hand. I always wondered if she knew what mom had done to me. Five years crawled by like this. I bounced between apartments, worked my way up to assistant manager positions, slowly built a small emergency fund. Mom would occasionally text on holidays. Generic thinking of you messages that felt more like obligation than love. Then grandma died suddenly. Heart attack in her sleep. At the funeral, mom cried dramatically while Tyler stood there checking his phone. I Was the one who held Grandma's hand during her final hospital visit. I was the one who knew she wanted to be buried next to Grandpa, wearing her blue dress. A week later, the lawyer called. Grandma had left me everything. Her house, her savings, her vintage jewelry collection that I'd always admired. The reading of the will was surreal. Mom kept shooting me confused glances, like there must be some mistake. But the real shock came when mom

I was 22, living my best life when my phone exploded with calls from my entire family. My cousin Eve, who was 16, told everyone I'd been sneaking into her room and that she was now pregnant with my baby. The whole family believed her instantly. My parents screamed at me over the phone, calling me disgusting. My siblings blocked me on everything. Even my grandparents who raised me wouldn't take my calls. I had zero proof it wasn't true. Eve was the family princess. I was just a black sheep cousin who barely came around anymore. The accusation spread like wildfire through our tight knit extended family. Aunts and uncles who used to invite me to barbecues suddenly acted like I didn't exist. My mom's sister, Eve's mother, posted critical Facebook statuses about protecting our children from predators in our own family. Within a week, I was completely erased from every family group chat, every holiday plan, every graduation announcement. The next year destroyed me completely. I waited every day for police to show up at my door with handcuffs. Every knock made my heart stop. Every phone call from an unknown number sent me into a panic attack. I lost my job at the auto shop because I couldn't focus, kept making mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss finally sat me down and said, whatever was going on? At home, needed to stay there, but I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment three months later when I couldn't make rent, moved in with a buddy who let me crash on his couch. But even he started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Started drinking heavily just to sleep, then drinking to get through the day, then drinking because breathing felt impossible without it. Dating became a nightmare. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried to date asked to meet my parents. After 2 months, I made up some story about them being dead. Second girl saw through the lies when she noticed I had 0 family photos, no childhood stories, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. And when I couldn't give a straight answer, she was gone by morning. The isolation was crushing. Holidays were the worst. Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call. I'd drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway knowing they were all inside without me. I finally moved three states away and started completely over. New job, new friends, new identity. Told everyone I met that my family lived far away and we weren't close. Simple, clean lie that people accepted. Got into therapy, got sober, worked my ass off to build something resembling a normal life.

My love for you will give you all the energy you need. Oh, that's so sweet. You're right. I do have enough energy for one more trip. Meet me at the car. Yay! I'm bringing my barbies. I'm bringing my new barbies to come play with you. Emma, I miss you so much. You were the best thing I had in my life. I will never forget you. And I'll keep that promise that we made at your grave that I will come play barbies with you every single day. I love you so much. Mommy, when will you be back from work? I have to go see Emma again today so we can play barbies. Yesterday was so fun with her. I was so happy I could spend time with her. Sorry, baby, I won't be able to make it home on time because of this snowstorm. But Mommy, I made a promise to Emma that I would never miss a day. I'm so sorry, Tammy, but I can't today. Don't be sorry, Mommy. I won't break my promise to Emma. Wait, honey, what do you mean by that? Tammy? Justin, where is Tammy? I don't know. Why are you asking me? You didn't watch over your little sister? I looked over the entire house and she's not here. And that's my problem. How, oh, my god. I think she went to Emma's grave. Wait. How would she even be able to walk all the way over there by herself in the snow? No time for questions. Get in your car and drive to the cemetery now. Whatever. Did you find anything, Justin? I looked around. And found nothing. Oh, my God. Not my Tammy. Well, actually, I did find this one thing, two frozen barbies in front of Emma's Tombstone. Oh, my God. No.

Where did you hear that date? It was in the note with Dad's watch. The watch you said was destroyed. Emma, where are you right now? Still at Jessica's. Her mom's about to drive me home. Number? Go to Aunt Claire's instead. Don't come home. You're scaring me. What's going on with these texts from Dad's number? Someone is trying to manipulate you. Your father died in that accident last month. Then why is his watch here? Why does someone know about July 15th? Your father's former partner must have gotten access to his personal effects. What partner? You said dad worked alone. I needed to protect you from certain aspects of his work. There's another text. Ask about the offshore account in the Caymans. Don't respond to any more messages. They're trying to get information. Information about what? What was dad involved in? Your father was an accountant for some powerful people. He found discrepancies. Criminal discrepancies. Was dad in danger? We're in the car now. Jessica's mom is acting strange. She keeps checking her mirrors. Is she taking you to our house or to Claire's? Neither. We're heading toward the lakehouse where the text said to go. Emma, that's not Jessica's mother. The real Carol has a scar on her wrist. She's wearing long sleeves. I can't tell. Ask to use her phone. Say yours is dying. She refused. Said her battery is low, too. Try to get a look at her wrist. Find An excuse. I asked her to check the time. No scar. Mom, who is this woman? Listen carefully. When she slows down at the next intersection, unlock your door and run. She just locked all the doors from her control panel. Is there anything in the car you can use as a weapon? Jessica's field hockey stick is in the backseat. I'm 10 minutes from the lakehouse. Is she still heading there? Yes. She just got a call. She's speaking another language. Sounds Eastern European. Your father's files exposed an international money laundering operation. Dad was just an accountant. How did he get involved in this? He was recruited specifically because of his skills. He didn't know what they were hiding. She's pulling over at the convenience store. Says she needs cigarettes. This is your chance. Get out while she's inside. I can't. She took the keys and told me she'll be watching through the window. Check the glove compartment. Is there anything useful? There's a gun, mom. A real gun. Don't touch it. It could be a setup. She's coming back. She's talking to someone outside the car. Take a photo of them. Discreetly, if you can. Done. Sending it now. That's Andre Kozlov. He worked with your father's firm. We're driving again. They're taking me to the lakehouse. The watch, Emma, is there anything unusual about it? The back has a small SD card taped to it. I never noticed before. That's what they want. Your father must Have copied the evidence. Should I destroy it? No. It's the only leverage we have. It's evidence of their entire operation. We're at the lakehouse. There's a black SUV waiting. I'm two minutes away. Can you see who's in the SUV? It's Mister Peterson from Dad's office. The one who spoke at his funeral. He's the one who recruited your father. He's been leading this whole operation. She's making me get out of the car, stall, ask questions, keep them talking until I get there. Peterson says he just wants the watch and we'll be safe. He's lying. They can't leave witnesses. He's showing me a badge. FBI. Is that possible? Huh? Boost for part three.

Okay, so you have an ex? Yes. And what is his. What is his name? Brian. Okay, and when did he become your ex? Like, how fresh is this? It was last year, but we still talk to each other all the time. Okay, so. But he's dating someone else now? Yes. And her name is Hannah, and she seems totally nice and everything. I know a few people who know her, too. They said she's super nice, and they seem happy together. But here's the thing. I keep telling her that Brian is doing things behind her back, and she keeps ignoring me when I try to help. Okay. Do. Doing what things behind her back? Talking to other girls, talking to me still, and trying to get me to actually hook up with him. So Brian is still trying to hook up with you even though he has a new girl? Pretty much. And I tried getting a message out to her, and she blocked me, so I just. Yeah. Oh, wow. Well, how did you try contacting her? Contacting her? Did you, like, DM her or something? Like, what'd you do? Yeah, I tried dming her through Instagram, but she blocked me right away. She told her friends not to talk to me either. She told them I was Brian's psycho ex. But really, truthfully, all I'm trying to do is help her here. Okay, so you're trying to be the nice person here so she doesn't get her heart broken like you did? Basically, yeah. Okay, but she won't listen to you. Probably cause Brian himself is probably been like, ah, she's my psycho ex, don't listen to her. I guess, yeah. Okay, yeah, but the whole thing is. Didn't you say Brian was still trying to hook up with you? Like he's still trying to get with you. I mean, we're supposed to be going out for drinks this weekend and he specifically told me not to mention it to anyone because of Hannah. Oh wow, that's shady. Okay, so. But she doesn't believe you. Well, alright, what if we did this? What if we got Brian on the phone, okay, and then also had this Hannah girl on listening, like on a third line. And then you sort of talked about hooking up or your little drinks date coming up. And then she'd be able to hear everything herself. That way you wouldn't have to convince anybody of anything cause she'd hear it for herself. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Okay. Alright, good. So it's an old fashioned Three Way call. We can set that up, no problem. Wait, do we have the other girl's number? Oh yeah, do we have. Yeah, This new Hannah Girls phone number. I have her number, yes. Oh, okay, well, there you go. Three Way. Action time it is. We'll do that when we come back. Next we're gonna do an old fashioned zoo morning zoo Three Way. But before we get to the actual call. And we're ready to go with this. Yes. Okay, so please welcome Hannah to the show. Hello, Hannah. Hello. So, shag talked to you already, right? We're on live. Watch the language, that sort of thing. Yes. Okay, so before we bring her on, Hannah, tell us what you know about Chantal, your current man. Brian's ex. Uh. Oh, boy. Um, not much. Just that they dated, they broke up, and she's sort of crazy, I guess. Oh, okay, let's bring Chantelle on real quick. So, Chantelle, before we do this, what did you want to say to Hannah? Just that I am not crazy, and I'm only trying to prevent you here from getting hurt. That's. That's it? That's really it? Okay, Hannah, I mean, if. Okay, if you're just trying to help me, then what was wrong with keeping all this private? Like, why do we have to do all of this on the radio? Because you won't answer me when I try to talk to you. You blocked me on Instagram, that's why. Yeah, I blocked you because Brian asked me to. He said he didn't want you spying on him. Well, like I said, I'm only. I'm only Trying to help you here. Okay, so listen, we came up with this idea here real quick. We wanted to call Brian up, and then. Chantelle, why don't you ask him about your supposed upcoming date that he made with you behind Hannah's back and see what he says? Fine with me. And Hannah. We're gonna turn your line down while she's talking to him, but you're still gonna get to hear everything that's being said. Okay? I mean, I just think this is really immature, but whatever. Okay, hang on, Chantal. We're gonna call him up here, and when he answers, you're on. Okay?

I'm home. Babe. You're not here. Where'd you go? Still at work. Overtime, tons to do. Deadline tomorrow. Go to bed. I'll be back when I'm done. Babe, my head's killing me. Okay, noted. Did you hear me? My head hurts. Can't talk. Busy. We'll discuss when I'm back. Changed? You don't care about me at all anymore. So cold and distant. Nothing like when we first met. I go out now. No calls, no texts. Let me ask you. Isn't this what you wanted? Not prying, giving you space. This is what you told me before. I'm doing it now. Isn't that enough? What more do you want? Why are you unhappy now? You've got it all wrong, babe. This isn't what I wanted. I want you to be your old self again. The girl who only had eyes for me. Back to how We were when we first fell in love. It's too late. We can't go back. I'm numb now. I see things clearly. Let the past be the past. There's something I've wanted to tell you for a while.

Oh, my god. I was just about to do the same thing. Our phones were switched. I know. I hate this stupid school. They are the only ones who take our phones for assemblies. It's so annoying. Anyways, when can we meet? Uh, about that. What? My family and I were going on a road trip right after school, and we already left. We are an hour away, and trust me, I can't make them mad by asking to go back. You're lying. What the hell am I going to do with your phone for however long you are gone? I'm gone for the weekend. What? I can't wait three days. I have things to do. You know, sorry, Adam, but I don't know what to say. You're going to have to wait. Wait. How do you know who I am? Oh, uh, yeah, you know, I heard of you, at least. But how did you know it was my phone? When you texted me, I clicked on the notification and it showed your messages. Your last text was from your mom. So we are going through each other's messages now? No, no, it wasn't like that. I didn't mean to. Ha ha. I know. I'm just playing with you. So who am I speaking to then? You don't know me. Let's just keep it that way. Oh, come on. That's no fun. What's your name? Lily. Lily Smith. Yeah, you know me? Well, you know, heard of you. At least. Ah, you got me there. Yeah. Ha ha. So are we really doing this? Three days with each other's phones? There's no other choice. Unless you wanna drive six hours to meet us at our first stop, be my guest. Yeah, I don't know about all that. Anyways, let's make this interesting. How about we both can choose one app that's off limits? Alright, what app are you gonna choose? I choose notes. Notes? What the hell you got going on in there? Nothing. I chose it so now you can't see it. Okay then I'm going to do Snapchat. I wonder why. Oh stop it. Are you trying to call me a fuck boy? Ha ha. Maybe. At least get to know me. Just because I play football does not mean I'm one of them. I guess we will have to wait and see. Oh shoot, my dad just told me cell service is about to go out. We are in the middle of nowhere. I'll text you in a bit. Alright, see you soon Lily. Gosh, that was long. Thankfully you had games on your phone. Oh yeah, glad I could help. Haha, those come in handy sometimes. Hey, I have a question. Are you still dating Emma? Emma? How do you know about her? Everyone was talking about you guys and how great of a couple you were. Oh, well thankfully that's no longer. Thankfully? Yeah, she cheated on me. Oh my god, I'm so Sorry. No, no, don't be. I'm glad it happened. Why? Rizz app. What should I say? Because now I got my eyes on finding someone better. Because now I got my eyes on finding someone better. Oh. Anyone in mind? Uh, I don't know. I guess you could say I have a little crush. Really? Who? Ha, ha. You aren't gonna find out that easy. Oh, my god, you are really going to make me wait. Well, you are making me wait 3 days for my phone, so I think you can wait as well. Okay, maybe you're right. Ha, ha. It's getting kind of late. I think I'm gonna head to bed. Okay. Good night, Adam. Good night, Lily. Good morning, Lily. I hope you slept well. If you count sleeping in the back of a van sleeping well, then I guess you could say I did. Oh, yeah. Ha, ha. I forgot about that. Hey, I have a question. Go for it. What's in your notes that is so important? Oh, my god, stop. You can't look. I won't, but I'm curious now. Ha ha. Well, how about this? At the end of the trip, you can open my notes app on one condition. Which is? You tell me who your crush is. Oh, I think I could work with that. Yay! So where did you guys road trip to? We just got to Baltimore. No way. I have family there. Could they meet you and get my Phone. Oh, I mean, we are just about to leave now. I don't think we can. Haha, I'm just messing with you. I don't have family there. Oh my god, you scared me for a second. I'm guessing you're not actually leaving. Just wanted to keep talking. Well, I guess you could say you were right. Haha, I knew it. I'm actually sort of glad this all happened. Me too. You're really fun to talk to. Oh, thanks. I think I'm gonna go play some basketball. Okay. Have fun. Who said I was going? How are you gonna play while texting me? That's why Facetime was invented. Facetime? Uh, I don't know about that. Why not? I don't look good right now. Oh stop it. I see you every day and you look amazing all the time. Now is no different. Do you really think that? Of course. OMG, you're so sweet. Ha ha. I tried. Now pick up. Alright. Well that was fun, wasn't it? Yeah, you could say that. I didn't know you were that good at basketball. You play football? Ha ha. Well, what can I say? An athlete is an athlete. I'm gonna shower and get ready for bed now, Adam. Okay. I'll have you know though, tomorrow is the big day. Yeah. Ha ha. See you then. Good morning, Adam. Wakey Wakey, I'm awake. Your message notification can wake up my whole house, let alone just me. Haha yeah, it is a pretty loud one. So can I go on the notes app yet? Not just yet. Have some patience. You can do it when I'm an hour away from home. And how long is that gonna be? Well, for starters, I'm 6 hours out. Oh, my god. So long. For what? This better be good. Hopefully you like it. Me? Why would I like it? Oh, I don't know. I mean, just like after the wait. I hope you like it. I see. Well, I never thought I would be texting myself, but I will say this has been pretty fun. Same to you, Adam. Yeah, I was going to complain to the school about getting our phones mixed up, but I guess I'll cut them a break this time. Ha ha. This time. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. If it's with you, I wouldn't mind. Oh, okay, Adam, we are going back to a no service area. I'll text you when I'm close. Okay. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

Flirting with your boyfriend? Honey, I'd never do such a thing. Mom, you are not slick. Every time I bring him over, you're extra sweet and nice with him, hugging him all closely and tightly. You make sure to wear your skimpiest outfit whenever he comes over. Then you always bend over and pick things up in front of him. Mom, stop this! Oh Sasha, I have no idea what you mean, but if you're afraid of your man taking more of a liking to me, you should be. Everyone knows Mama is way more attractive. Haha! Mom, how could you say that? Why are you always so mean to me? It's like you're always in competition with me. I'm literally your daughter, but you never show me love. You're a grown ass woman who's stuck acting like a teenager. Grow up! Oh gosh, no daughter of mine would look like that. Stop your crying. I provide you everything. That's all you need. Astro app! I need astrology help! My mom keeps acting like a flirting with my boyfriend. What should I do? Pisces have a reputation for being very flirtatious and trying to take people's partners. Try telling your mom how you feel. Mom, just stay away from my boyfriend. He's coming over today and I don't want you flirting with him. Whatever, Sasha. I can't help that your boyfriend gravitates towards me. Tee Hee. Just stay away. Mom, can you Not! What are you whining about now, Sasha? Hahaha! You literally kissed Jack on the cheek as soon as he walked in. Stop! And you see the way he blushed at me when I gave it to him? Hahaha! You must be careful honey, or you man might vanish. Mom, please stop this, I'm begging you. You've done nothing but make my life a living. I've tried my best to be the daughter you've all always wanted, but it's never enough for you. Never pretty enough, never smart enough. Just not good enough for you. Maybe if you got better grades in school I'd stay away from your man. But no, you just flunk everything. This is your punishment. And the final punishment will be me taking him. Haha! Mom, no, please! This is the only boy who's ever shown me attention in my life. Please don't ruin it. It's not my fault you didn't get your mama's attractive jeans. Haha, don't cry to me about it. Take it up with god. If you can excuse me, I'm going to look for an outfit Jack will really appreciate. Mom, please! Mom, what did you do? You took Jack to the room and I heard you two making macaroni and cheese sounds. There's no way you actually did it. I told you Honey Bun, this is your punishment. You thought I was joking? Jakey Poo is mine now. You think you deserved a guy that handsome and tall? I bet you Haven't even seen his pencil yet. Mama did first, and it's huge. Haha! Mom, how could you do this to your only daughter? Me and Jack didn't even make it to that stage yet, and you took the card before me? I thought you loved me. Oh, cry and weep somewhere else. Me and Jack are going on a date tonight. I turned him and he's mine now. Make sure this home is spotless when I come back, or you're grounded. Here's no way. You know what? When you come back, you're going to see something you'll never be able to forget. Hopefully it's you wearing an outfit that actually matches. Ha ha ha! You'll see.

Yesterday, my phone rang at 2:00am. It was the police. Ma'am, we have your 6 year old son, Tommy at the station. He walked here by himself, saying his mommy hurt his baby sister. I shot out of bed. What? Tommy's in his room sleeping. And I don't have a baby sister. Ma'am, please come down to the station immediately. I ran to Tommy's room. Empty bed, front door wide open. At the police station, Tommy was wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The moment he saw me, he screamed, don't let her take me! She killed my sister. My heart stopped. The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, Buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away, too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room while Tommy sobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My Stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. I spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. His little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. Psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy story never changed. Hours passed. Detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She. She showed me the room she made all pink. And pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us? But before I could answer,

And he's just short by a tiny bit. How much is he short? Only 48 thousand dollars. I already told him we'd help. We have plenty of money anyway. A 50 thousand dollar car and he's short forty eight thousand dollars? Is this some kind of joke? Why don't I just buy him the whole car then? Yes, yes. You're the best husband ever. Quick, give me the money! Hold on, he makes $200 a month. How's he going to maintain it? Gas, insurance, repairs. Besides, our own car only cost $20,000. He absolutely must have a car. He's getting married soon. A 50 thousand dollar car gives him so much face. I think when buying cars, you should go straight to the top. Mom, my brother and I already went car shopping and we all agree it's perfect. Hmm. A 50 thousand dollar car. I'm sure it's nice even without seeing it. Hurry up, babe. Give me the money. They need the deposit today. Why am I the one paying? Do you know why I don't let you handle our money anymore? It's precisely to prevent this.

What for? Hey, brother, your sister's husband here. Got something to discuss with you. What's up, bro? What's going on? So I spotted this great apartment, but I'm short $5,000 on the down payment. Wondering if I could borrow from you. Huh? Don't you already have two apartments? Why buy another one? Look, don't buy it right now. I'm trying to get a car and was planning to borrow $48,000 from you. What? You wanna borrow from me too? And $48,000? I've already paid the deposit on this place. I really don't have extra cash. Are you doing this on purpose? You knew I wanted to buy a car, and now you pull this stunt? Brother, don't get upset. I'm not targeting you. Just trying to understand something. From what you're saying, I should lend you $48,000 without question, but you can't lend me $5,000? Is. Is that the logic here? You've known about my car plans forever. How could I possibly have money to lend you? You won't even lend me $5,000, so why should I lend you $48,000? Isn't that a blatant double standard? Because you're my sister's husband. Oh, so just because I'm your sister's husband, I'm obligated to support you unconditionally? I have zero responsibility toward you. I spent a fortune on our wedding when I married your sister. This isn't even a life or death Situation. I'm done talking to you. I'll ask my sister directly. All our money is with me. Going to her won't help. Listen to me. You will give this money to my brother. Give me the money now! Amy, listen to yourself. This isn't healthy. You know what's not healthy? Watching my brother struggle while we sit in our comfortable house with money in the bank. I guess I finally see where your priorities lie.

We've all been either shot with a BB gun or stabbed with a fucking Jart. The television stations had to make a commercial reminding our parents that they had kids. I shit you not. Every night on the ten PM news, a voice would come on and say, it's ten PM. Do you know where your children are? To remind our parents that they had fucking kids. So, no, sir, shirtless with the beanie, sinks were not an option.

It might be enough to make you late for work, but not enough to keep you home all day. I bet if it's your first time seeing snow, it'd feel like a lot of money. That's a bless your heart.

This is my story. Yesterday, I called up an old veteran buddy, mine, mine, and my dad's, and I ain't seen him in a while, and I wanted to take him to dinner and just kind of catch up. So called him up, asked him to supper. He said, yeah. And I met him down at the restaurant in the parking lot. We walked in together, went and sat down at the booth, and the waitress come up to us, said, hey, can I get y'all something to drink? He said, yes, ma'am, I believe I'm gonna have a sweet tea. Zack, what are you gonna have? Before I could answer, the waitress cut my buddy off and said, uh, excuse me, but I don't really believe in genders. I actually identify as they them. So whenever you address me, can you make sure that you address me as they them? He goes, I don't care about that. Zack, you gonna have sweet tea? I said, yes, sir. He said, two sweet teas, please. They walk off, bring back the tea. When they set the tea down on the table, I say, just consider what I told you. This is a new day and time, and you really need to honour what people identify as. He goes, okay, I'll consider it. Me, him, sitting there, shit, shooting shit, chewing a fat shit like that. And she come back about 5 minutes later says, can I get y'all something to eat? He said, yes, yes, I'm. I'mma believe I'm gonna have the all American cheeseburger. Zach, what you gonna have? I said, I'll have the same all American cheeseburger, just add bacon to it. And they say, okay, well, have you considered what I told you about earlier? He said, I'm still considering, I'm still considering. But I'll tell you what, before you run off, would you mind topping off this tea? Cause he had drank about that much out of his glass. They ran, got him the tea, brought it back to the table. While we were waiting on our food, waitress passed on by again, stopped by the table and said, do you need any more explanation? Like, I would really like to talk about this some more, the way I can get you a full understanding of why I am the way I am. He said, um, no, I don't need any more explanation. But I'll tell you what I do need. I need you to top off this tea for me. This some good tea right here. They take the tea, they go and top it off, they bring it back to the table, the food comes out, and we sitting there eating. And as we're eating, they come by and they say, hey, y'all need anything else? Y'all need ketchup or anything like that? And say, no, we're good. It's delicious. Thank you. And before They walk off from the table, they say, you sure you don't wanna talk about this some more? I really feel like I can get through to you. He goes, no, I just wanna eat my cheeseburger. But I tell you what I do need. I need you to top off this tea for me. I'm telling you, some of the best tea I've ever had. They go top off the tea and come back. Now, wait, let's fast forward to when they bring the check. When they bring the check, they walk up to the table and they throw the check on the table. Okay? And they say, you're going to accept me for who I am. Okay? You have been dodging this situation since you walked in here. You are going to accept me for who I am. I am a person. You can't deny that. And you need to honour my wishes about who I identify as. You need to address me as such. Well, my buddy takes his last bite of hamburger, wipes his mouth, looks up and says, let me explain something to you. The difference between me and you. Okay? I was gonna tip you very well because you were a very good waiter. You really were. You were fantastic. My tea was always full. You. You checked on us throughout the entire meal and everything. But because of what you just did, you just explained something to me that I already knew about. You. You being noticed and acknowledged is more important than you getting paid. Because now you get no tip. You see, cause you were rude to us right here at the end of our meal. And up until this point, you were a pretty good waiter. I didn't do anything bad towards you. I didn't misaddress you. I just didn't address you as anything. But because I didn't adhere to your little agenda, you got mad. So now you've explained to me that it's way more important for you to be acknowledged than it is for you to be paid. And that's the difference between Republicans and Democrats. We want what's in the pocket. Y'all want some kind of recognition, and I'm not gonna give it to you. We walk out of the door of the restaurant after that, and I looked at him and I said, man, what? Like, how, how. How do you know that was gonna happen? And he looked at me and he said, Zach, I'm old buddy. But I've Learned a few things throughout the years. Most people, when they come at you, they just want a reaction. Because if they get a reaction out of you, it means they have power over you. If you give them no reaction, they have no power over you. And that drives people crazier than you can even imagine. Keep that in mind next time you're in a situation like this. So I Learned something today. Not every Action deserves an equal and opposite reaction. Sometimes you just gotta kill them with kindness. That's some cool shit. And she lost her shit over absolutely nothing. And I'm pretty sure that I'm gonna go back there today and get her fired. Because, you know, that's who I am as a person. Love y'all to death. Y'all enjoy shit.

And I really, truly don't give a fuck. But let me tell you something, women. Intuition is real. And if you don't believe it, check your roster of how many times you got caught up in a situation that you thought we would not find out about. Okay? When we get intuition, um, we get anxious, we get antsy, we can't sleep. It urges us to be a fucking psycho, a stalker, spy on you, figure out what's really going on. Right? What blows my mind is that when the truth comes out, days later, weeks later, months later, then you wanna get mad at us. Cause now we look at you like a fucking liar. Now everything you tell us that you're doing, you're a fucking liar. But then we become the crazy ones, right? And then the roles reverse, and then they call us a liar. Oh, if you can't trust me, that gives me reason to think that you're doing something that you shouldn't be doing. That's why men are narcissistic as fuck. And it is disgusting. You want us to trust you when you fucking lie. And I'm never gonna cave in, because I've never been a liar to any man that I'm really, really down for. Or if I'm in a relationship, I've never fucking cheated. So it blows my mind how a man can sit there and get mad at you because of their fucking Actions. And this is why I do not trust men. Because they do weird ass shit all the fucking time. All the fucking time. I can go on a rant 24 7 every single day on why men are trash. And I'm not saying all men, but most men. Y'all fucking lie. Y'all do shit behind our back. When we find out or have intuition, we're fucking crazy. We're wrong. Rules get reversed. We shouldn't have been looking. We shouldn't have been doing this, we shouldn't have been doing that. Now you found something. You don't want to see this. And the third. No, you should have been a real ass motherfucker. Just how you ride out for your boys in the street. That's how you should ride out for the woman that really fucking loves you, right? Y'all are weird. Y'all are weird. Y'all are weird. And it's really weird. Let me go into this. It's really weird how men are so homophobic. It's really weird because they want us to not be emotional creatures. They want us to be strong. They want us to stop bitching and. And crying in this and that, knowing that's how women are, knowing that's how we already are. And they want us to be more like their friends. So why don't you go date your friends? But y'all are so homophobic, right? But you want your women to be like your. Your. Your homeboys, right? If your homeboy calls you cause he's Having a rough day and he's going through something. Oh, I gotta go. My bro's going through it. But when a woman cries and is going through something, we're just fucking annoying and we're complaining. Which side do you want? Which. Which part of us do you want? I'm sick of men.

Italy here in my country, only my country. That, by the way, needs no fucking introduction about the culinary culture. We normally use at least 30 kind of spices, but there are many more along those lines. I hear all they eat is fish. So I guess Europe and Japan are pretty similar. But, I mean, you all know this.

This past week, I got to go to Mexico, and I gotta tell y'all, the trip was amazing. Until the last day, at least. You see, the night before, I had had a little bit too much to drink. So, understandably, when I got up to brush my teeth, I was a little hungover. Okay, a lot hungover. See, at home, I have no problem drinking water out of the faucet, but in Mexico, that's a no, no. You heard? So I knew I messed up the second the water hit my tongue. I just had a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. Well, maybe more like a gurgle. I spent the next couple of hours dreading what was to come. But to be honest, like, not really much happened. I mean, I was always a little gassy, but that's pretty normal for me. Anyway, that night, we had a wine tasting, like, fancy dinner. Everybody was dressed to the nines, right? So we get in the elevator to go down, and it hits. I swear, my stomach was rumbling like Mount Krakatoa. So by the time we got to that bottom floor, I thought I was gonna erupt, and people are gonna be covered in an ash cloud of caca. I'm talking. I had to go, and I had to go now. So in one of my rare, but Brilliant moments. I decided I forgot my wallet in the room, and I need to go get it. So I press the button for the elevator to go back up. Elevator gets there, and guess what? It's full. And they're not getting off at that floor. This ain't gonna wait for another elevator to get there. So I make a break for it. I run down past the convention center to the most remote bathroom I can possibly find so nobody has to listen to the sins I'm about to commit in this room. Through the bathroom door. And guess what? Somebody's a boyla. Sweet little old lady sitting there, just finished cleaning the whole bathroom. And she goes, oh, yeah? And I go, see, the thing you gotta understand is this ain't no 50 saw bathroom. This ain't no Bucky's. This is a one year old, one saw bathroom and a boy. She ain't leaving. This one is happening either way. So I got two choices. The floor or the toilet. I chose the toilet. Let me tell y'all the sounds. It wasn't solid. It wasn't liquid like. Like pebbles being gently washed down a river. It was. It was bad. I start gagging. She starts gagging. And then I just hear a. A thud. I slowly go to look underneath the stall, and this lady is passed out. I have to call an ambulance from the toilet seat, and the operator can barely understand me because sounds like There's a machine gun going off in the freaking background when it's really just my butt. Don't worry, like, she's okay. But moral of the story, don't drink the water in Mexico cause you might kill somebody's grandma.

It might be enough to make you late for work, but not enough to keep you home all day. I bet if it's your first time seeing snow, it'd feel like a lot. You have others?

You are not ready. Buckle up. So it took almost two years for them to get my meds right, and I just cycled that whole time. After nine years of marriage and two children, I came out to my ex wife via text. In fact, I came out to everyone I know via text that night. Flew to Texas to spend several days with a man that I had never met. Shoplifted like $15,000 worth of stuff. I mean one time I got a futon from Walmart. Needed to try everything that included meth and I get so addicted to that and went to rehab. Got arrested seven times, including one felony, then spent 24 days in jail. My body count went from one to more than 250. Went missing for like 3 weeks. Lived in my car and became a hooker. Was held up at gunpoint in someone's apartment for a day and a half. Oh. Moved a homeless meth addict into my parents basement and had sex on camera for money. Lost custody of my children because I threatened to kidnap them. But now my meds are right and things are Gucci.

And one of the first questions was do you ever finish other people's sentences for them while they're talking? And I was like, no, that's rude. And she goes, did you ever do that as a kid? And I was like, yeah, all the time. And she's like, alright, so now as an adult, when someone's speaking, do you mentally finish their sentences for them but still wait for them to finish? And I was like, yeah, doesn't everyone? She was like no. And I was like what? I have done that for my entire life. You're telling me that when people are talking, you don't try to finish with their sentences cause they're taking too long? And she's like, no, that's insane. And I was like, what? But how do you have our answer ready by the time they're done talking if you don't try to figure it out what the end of the sentence is? And she was like you don't. I was like, oh. She's like, yeah, I'm definitely gonna give you this prescription. I was like, that's. That's probably a good idea.

I fucked around one time accidentally did that and I was tasting colors and speaking in cursive for two weeks. Y'all don't play around with these women like that.

So please, for the love of fucking God, guys, please don't be silly. Wrap your willy.

Growing up, my sister Kayla made everything about her. My birthday parties. She got gifts, too, because I wouldn't exist without her. Every graduation, every achievement hijacked. When I won the science fair in eighth grade, she convinced my parents to throw her a supportive sister party the same night. When I got into college, she announced her engagement at my Celebration dinner. When I graduated with honors, she showed up in a revealing red dress and spent the whole ceremony flirting with professors. The pattern never stopped. Kayla had this way of making herself the victim whenever I achieved anything. You're so lucky, she'd say. I sacrificed so much for you growing up. Meanwhile, I was the one babysitting her kids while she partied through her 20s. I was the one lending her money she never paid back. I was the one covering for her when she bailed on family obligations. When I got engaged to my Indian fiance. Yeah. I was terrified Kayla would find a way to ruin it. Sure enough, at our engagement party, she immediately joked about wearing white to our wedding. It'll be so funny. She laughed. Like in the movies. I'll be the mysterious woman in white. She even made this dramatic pose, hand on her forehead like some soap opera actress. I pulled her aside and told her, absolutely not. This is my one day. Kayla, please. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic, that it was just a joke. God, you're so sensitive. It's not like anyone would actually confuse me for the bride. But she seemed to agree to drop it. Two weeks later, I found out she'd gone behind my back and asked. Yeah, directly. Your sister seems really excited about her dress choice. Priya mentioned casually over dinner. She kept asking about fabric and styles. My blood ran cold. I knew exactly what that meant. I freaked out on Priya explaining Kayla's entire history of stealing my moments. She did this at my high school graduation. Wore this attention grabbing red dress, and flirted with all the dads. At my college graduation, she announced her pregnancy. She'll definitely show up in some elaborate white gown designed to make everyone look at her instead of us. That night, I had a complete breakdown. Sobbing, hyperventilating. 28 years of suppressed resentment came pouring out. I was convinced Priya would see my toxic family dynamics and run for the hills. Who wants to marry into that kind of drama? Instead, she held me and said something. Gene

But what happened next destroyed her career. So this director, Jessica, shows up at our biotech firm in January, immediately starts making changes. She's got this NBA swagger, calling our methods outdated and pushing for streamline efficiency. Three months in, she calls me into a conference room with my whole team watching through the glass walls. We're going in a different direction. She announces, your position is redundant. You're terminated effective immediately. I've been there eight years. Here's built every client relationship from scratch. But I just nodded professionally and started packing my desk. My team looked shocked. Sarah actually had tears in her eyes. As I'm carrying my box to the elevator, I casually mention hope Friday's client presentation goes well. Jessica freezes mid stride. What presentation? I turned back with a smile. The Hollowgate systems review. Big one. Oh, well, you'll figure it out. Her face went pale. See, Hollowgate was our biggest client, a two point three million dollar annual contract. They were flying their entire sea suite in from Seattle Friday morning for a comprehensive technical review. I've been preparing for three months. All the calibration specs, sensor protocols, compliance documentation, everything was stored in my personal leather notebooks that I bought with my own money. Over the years, Jessica had never bothered learning the technical side. She was all about relationship optimization and digital transformation. But our clients were old school engineers who wanted Detailed hands on expertise. Friday morning at 8:00am, my phone starts buzzing. Jessica calling. I let it ring, then again. By 9:15, she'd called 12 times. At 9:33, my former teammate Beth text, it's me. SOS Hollowgate team is here. Jessica's in full panic mode. Where are the technical specs they're asking for? I'm sipping coffee on my porch typing back. Should be in the system, she says. There's nothing, just basic contact info. Of course, there wasn't. All the real technical documentation lived in my notebooks, stuff that mattered, sensor calibration tolerances, environmental testing parameters, custom modification requests. I'd handwritten everything during countless client calls and site visits. At 10:15, Beth calls directly. Randy, they're asking for you specifically. The CTO wants to discuss the pressure sensor modifications you designed for their Portland.

So I moved across the country for my dream job. But six months later, she showed up at my door, saying, I'm ready to commit now, because distance doesn't matter when it's real love. And I laughed before introducing her to my new fiance, who was cooking dinner in our kitchen. I'm Marcus, 26, and when Jess dumped me six months ago, she said I was emotionally unavailable and socially stunted. Her exact words. You hide behind your work and can't form real connections. I need someone who actually has friends and knows how to be vulnerable. This happened right after I got accepted to my dream veterinary residency in Denver. We've been together two years, and I thought we were solid. I was planning to propose that Christmas, even had the ring picked out. The breakup destroyed me. I spent three days eating cereal in bed, questioning everything. Was I really that disconnected? Maybe she was right. Maybe I was just using her as a placeholder while focusing on my career. But I'd committed to the residency. So I packed up and drove to Denver with just my clothes, textbook, and a broken heart. If I was going to be miserable, at least I'd do something I loved. The animal hospital was this busy emergency clinic downtown. Doctor Peterson put me on 12 hour Shifts immediately. I was so exhausted learning new procedures that I barely thought about Jess. Something unexpected happened, though. My colleague Mike kept inviting me to trivia night at this bar. I made excuses. Too tired, had studying. But Mike was persistent, and I finally gave in just to shut him up. Trivia night was actually fun. Mike's team called themselves the Possum 4 and competed against other medical professionals. I was weirdly good at Animal Facts, making me valuable for the first time in months. I was laughing and genuinely enjoying people's company. Mike introduced me to his hiking group. Outdoorsy medical people doing weekend trails around Colorado. I'd always loved nature, but never had anyone to explore with. Suddenly, I was spending Saturdays climbing mountains and having real conversations with people, but who weren't Jess. Then I started volunteering at the city animal shelter on days off. They needed someone with medical training for health assessments. That's where I met Diana. She was the shelter coordinator. This amazing woman who knew every single animal's personality and hit

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the centre of attention for 5 minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance, Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day, the one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding, I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up, he said. And I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself and I just can't deal with that stress on my wedding day. The line went quiet for like 10 seconds. Then Jake exploded. Are you serious right now you're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. He's basically family. I tried. To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice, hoping he'd change his mind. He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, she says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted like 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewellery. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today with a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. He's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done, and I have to deal with.

So I got the perfect revenge. She crashed our cabin weekend claiming her Airbnb fell through. I knew it was BS the moment she showed up with a perfectly packed bag and a smug smile. My boyfriend Joseph felt bad for her and invited her to stay without even asking me. For three days straight, she kept creating these elaborate situations to make me look like the worst girlfriend ever. Like when she helped make dinner on Friday night. She volunteered to preheat the oven while I prepped ingredients. Everything seemed normal until I put our carefully marinated steaks in and they came out completely charred. She acted shocked when Joseph got mad at me for ruining our expensive dinner. Later, I noticed she'd secretly cranked the oven to 500 degrees. Saturday morning, she suggested we go hiking to this amazing waterfall she'd been to before. She gave me detailed directions to the trailhead while she rode with Joseph. Turns out she sent me to the wrong trail entirely. I spent two hours lost in the woods with no cell service while they bonded over waiting for me. When I finally found them at the actual trailhead, Joseph was visibly annoyed I'd kept them waiting. She just shrugged and said, oh, I guess I mixed up the directions. My bad. The manipulation got worse as the weekend went on. She kept doing this thing where she'd bring up inside jokes and memories from before I existed, making make me feel like an outsider in my own relationship. Remember when we did this? And remember when we did that? Always with this little smile directed at me. She'd also accidentally brush against Joe Joseph, constantly grab his arm when laughing, and find excuses to lean over him. During Saturday afternoon, we decided to go swimming in the lake. She conveniently forgot to pack a swimsuit and asked to borrow one of mine. The one she picked was my smallest bikini, and she made sure to comment loudly about how loose it was on her while adjusting it right in front of Joseph. Then she suggested we play volleyball in the water and kept accidentally bumping into me, making me lose my balance. Breaking point was Saturday night. We were all sitting by the fire when she pretended to be drunk and started crying about how much she missed the old days before I came along and changed everything. She was literally sobbing into Joseph's shoulder.

The courtroom erupted until I stood, handed the judge a two page document and said, check again. Judge simply looked at my wife and burst out laughing. My name is James and three months ago I caught my wife Lauren cheating with her yoga instructor, filed for divorce immediately thinking she'd hit the Jackpot. Since we've been married for five years, Lauren strutted into that Phoenix courtroom wearing a two thousand dollar dress I'd bought her. Confident as hell her lawyer was already calculating his commission on what they thought would be a four million dollar payout for my construction business and dad's inheritance. The whole courtroom was packed. Lauren had actually invited some of her friends to watch what she called James's comeuppance. She been telling everyone for weeks how she was about to become independently wealthy. Your honor, her attorney announced, adjusting his expensive tie. Mrs. Peterson deserves substantial compensation for supporting her husband's career growth during their five year marriage. Lauren actually winked at me from across the room. She thought I was just some heartbroken guy who'd roll over and pay whatever she demanded. Her friends in the gallery were practically grinning waiting for the show. But here's what Lauren didn't know. Six months before I caught her cheating, I'd started noticing weird charges on our joint credit card, expensive dinners at restaurants I'd never been to, hotel rooms Booked during girls trips that didn't add up, designer lingerie, purchases that never made it home. The final straw was when I found an 800 dollar charge at a jewelry store downtown. When I asked Lauren about it, she said she'd bought herself a birthday present. Problem was her birthday wasn't for four months. So I hired a private investigator named Frank. Best $5,000 I ever spent. Frank followed Lauren for six weeks. What he discovered was worse than I imagined. The yoga instructor was just the latest in a long line of a there's. There was also her personal trainer, a bartender from her favorite restaurant, and even one of my own business partners. Lauren had been using our joint accounts to fund these relationships, expensive gifts, romantic getaways, been paying for her affairs, gym memberships. She'd blown through nearly $50,000 of our money over two years. The two page document I handed Judge Ramirez wasn't financial records. It Frank's detailed investigation report proving Lauren had been having multiple affairs for over two years, complete with time stamped photos, hotel receipts, restaurant bills and screenshots of explicit text messages. Messages in Arizona, adultery doesn't automatically disqualify you from alimony, but it sure does when you've been systematically draining marital assets to fund your affairs. It's called waste of marital property and it's a big deal in divorce court. The judge read the first page slowly, his eyebrows climbing higher with each line. He flipped to page 2, studied the Photos and then burst out laughing so hard his.

So my wife, Emma, came home last Tuesday with that look on her face, the one all guilty and nervous like she just got caught stealing candy. She sat me down on our ratty old couch and started crying before she even said anything. Turns out she'd been hooking up with her coworker Jake for like three months. Three months while I was working double shifts at the warehouse to save up for our anniversary trip to Florida. She kept saying sorry over and over, begging me not to leave her, promising she'd cut all contact with this guy. I just sat there staring at our wedding photo on the coffee table, the one where we're both laughing because my cousin Rick photobombed us making bunny ears. We looked so happy, so stupid. Emma grabbed my hands and asked if I could ever forgive her. And here's where I became a complete psychopath. I looked her dead in the eyes and said yes. I told her we could work through this, that our marriage was stronger than one mistake, all that bullshit you see in movies. But I was lying through my teeth. The next morning, I called in sick to work and drove straight to Jake's apartment, found his address through Emma's Instagram. She tagged him at some restaurant last month. Dude answered the door in his boxers looking all confused. Introduce myself as Emma's husband and Watched his face go white. Then I very calmly explained that I knew everything and that he had exactly 24 hours to quit his job and move out of town or I'd be paying visits to his parents, his ex girlfriend Sarah, who he was apparently trying to win back, and his boss, who definitely didn't know he was screwing around with married co workers. Jake started stuttering about how sorry he was, how it meant nothing. I just smiled and handed him a printed email I'd already drafted to his entire office explaining the situation, told him this would be sent if he wasn't gone by Thursday. Me while at home, I was being the perfect forgiveness husband, made Emma her favorite pasta dinner, bought her flowers, even suggested couples therapy. She was so relieved and grateful, kept telling me how lucky she was to have such an understanding husband. Thursday came and Jake was gone. Just like that, Emma came home from work all confused because apparently he'd quit without notice and moved back to Ohio or something. She kept asking why he'd just disappear like that. I waited exactly one more week, let her think we were rebuilding our trust. Then last Friday, I casually mentioned over breakfast that I'd changed my mind about the whole forgiveness thing. Her face went from confused to terrified in about two seconds. I told her I'd known.

I've been the family disappointment for 23 years while my perfect older brother Kyle got everything handed to him when Grandpa died and left me his house in his will. Dad absolutely lost it. There's no way that senile old man left you anything, he snarled, pacing around our kitchen like a king aged animal. You're probably not even my real son. Anyway, your mother was sleeping around before we got married. My brother Kyle smirked from the corner. Yeah, remember how wild mom was back in college? Dad's got a point. My stepmother Linda chimed in with that fake sweet voice she always used. Honey, we just want what's fair for the real family. You understand, right? They gave me 48 hours to take a paternity test or they challenge the will in court. The whole extended family was already texting about it in the group chat, calling me a fraud and a bastard. Here's what none of them knew. I've been secretly taking care of Grandpa for the past two years while they all ignored him. Every single doctor's appointment when his arthritis got bad, every grocery run when he couldn't drive anymore, every lonely evening when he just wanted someone to talk to about grandma. I also knew about the second will he'd written just three months before he died. The next morning, dad changed the locks on Grandpa's house when I showed up with my key. I couldn't get in. My stuff was piled on the front lawn and garbage bags. You're trespassing, dad yelled from the window. This is family property until you prove you belong here. I called the police. Within an hour, Officer Ortiz was standing in the driveway reading the will. Sir, according to this legal document, your son owns this property. You're the one trespassing. Dad's face went red as they made him give me the new keys. The neighbors were all watching from their windows. Test day arrived at the family lawyer's office. The whole crew showed up like it was some kind of Celebration. Dad wore his best suit and kept checking his Rolex, probably already planning how to spend what he thought would be his inheritance money. Kyle brought his new girlfriend to show off. You're about to see how we handle fake family members, he told her loudly. Linda kept taking selfies, probably planning to post about their victory later. Uncle Robert and Aunt Deborah drove in from two states away just to witness my humiliation. The family group chat had been buzzing for days about this showdown.

Everyone laughed except me. I quietly raised my hot dog and said, challenge accepted. That night, I packed everything into two suitcases and left my key on the kitchen counter. No, no, no. Goodbye. Just gone. I've been the family doormat for 29 years, the one who organised every holiday, baked every birthday cake, and cleaned up everyone's messes while they took selfies without me. So when mom made that joke at our B B Q with my aunts and siblings all laughing, something inside me just clicked. I moved three hours away to a lakeside cabin, blocked everyone's numbers, and started over as Jade instead of JD, the nickname that made me feel like a child. For the first week, my phone stayed silent, exactly like mom predicted. But week two 2. My brother called 47 times. Turns out nobody knew how to work the washing machine I've been maintaining for years. Their clothes piled up like a laundry mountain until he finally had to buy new underwear instead of figuring out the spin cycle. Week 3, my sister showed up at my old job crying, begging my former co workers for my new number. She had a family emergency, aka couldn't figure out how to renew her car registration. The same registration I've been handling for her since she was 16. My coworkers Told her I'd moved states away. She broke down in the parking lot because she'd never even Learned where the DMV was located. She ended up paying $300 to some sketchy guy who promised to handle it. Month 2, dad drove to every apartment complex in the city looking for me. He never realised I was the one who remembered everyone's medication schedules, grocery lists, and which bills were due. When without me, he missed his blood pressure medication for three weeks and had to go to urgent care. The doctor asked if he had family support at home. Dad just stared at the floor and mumbled something about his daughter being away. Mom had a complete breakdown when she realized I've been handling all the family birthdays, anniversary reminders, and doctor appointments for decades. She forgot her own.

I nearly dropped the juice box I was handing to her little brother. What do you mean, sweetie? My voice came out higher than normal as my stomach dropped like a stone. Emma's big brown eyes stared at me with that brutal honesty only kids possess. Mommy was crying on the phone last night. She said, you ruined everything, and now daddy has to move out. The living room suddenly felt too small, too quiet, except for the cartoon still playing on the TV. I knelt down to Emma's level, my hands trembling slightly. sometimes adults say things when they're upset that don't make sense. But even as I said it, my mind raced through every interaction I'd had with the Morrison family. David thanking me for watching the kids still seeming distant lately, barely making eye contact during pickup. The way she'd started paying me through Venmo instead of cash, her messages cold and formal. Something was very wrong here, and I had no idea what I'd supposedly done. Emma tilted her head like she was trying to solve a puzzle. But mommy showed daddy pictures on her phone. She said you were doing bad things. My blood turned to ice as I grabbed my phone. With shaking fingers, I started scrolling through my photo gallery, my social media, anything that Rachel might have seen and misinterpret. Then I found it buried in my Instagram from two weeks ago. A photo I posted of myself making breakfast at 7:00am, still in my pajamas, with the caption Sunday morning vibes. In the background, barely visible through my kitchen window, was David's car parked in my driveway. But David hadn't been at my house that morning. I'd been alone, making pancakes for myself, like I did every weekend. I stared at the photo, zooming in on the silver sedan that looked exactly like his Honda Civic. The license plate was partially obscured, but the first three letters were clearly visible. K J H. David's plate started with K J H. I called my neighbor, Mrs. Chen, who had security cameras facing the road. Within twenty minutes, she'd sent me footage from that Sunday morning at 6:00am, showing David's car pulling into my driveway while I was clearly visible through my kitchen window, alone and cooking. The footage revealed something that made my stomach lurch. David had sat in my driveway for over an hour, just watching my house while I moved around inside, completely unaware. Mrs Chen's cameras captured him taking photos through his car window, angling his phone to make it look like he was inside with me. The time stamps showed he'd been there from 6:47 to 8:00am, documenting my morning routine like surveillance. I realised with growing horror that David had been creating fake evidence of an affair that didn't exist. I immediately called Rachel. My voice Shaking as I tried to explain, Rachel, I need to show you something about the photos David gave you. But she cut me off, screaming that I was a homewrecker who destroyed her family. She hung up before I could tell her about the security footage. Twenty minutes later, I heard shouting from next door. Through my window, I watched David storm out with a suitcase, while Rachel stood in the doorway yelling. Emma and her brother were pressed against their upstairs window, watching their world fall apart because of lies their father had created. Detective Morrison arrived that evening after Rachel filed a police report claiming David and I were having an affair. I showed her the security footage, the timeline of David's staged photographs, and my phone records proving I'd never communicated with him outside of babysitting arrangements. She studied everything carefully, then asked if I'd noticed any other strange behaviour.

Surprise! This is an intervention, my best friend Jules said with a grin, after lying to me about having a casual hangout this weekend. You told me we were watching Netflix, I said, looking at the fancy cocktail dress she had on. Honestly, I should have known better. Jules never did anything casually. She flipped on the T V. And sat me on the couch. You can still have your Netflix, but tonight you're going out with me. When I complained, she reminded me just how long I've been crying about my ex. It's been three months. You need a break. I shook my head furiously while she applied makeup to my face and said, I'm not ready. She grabbed my shoulders and looked me in the eyes. There's a rooftop party upstairs. You'll meet nice people, good wine, zero pressure. And forget about your stupid ex and the mean things he said. Got it? And if you can't do this for you, then do it for me. Give me back the bestie I know and love. I sighed and closed my eyes, letting them work their magic. At the rooftop, I tried to blend into the background, but Jules's cousin Dustin spotted me immediately. You must be the famous best friend, he said, smiling warmly. Jules talks about you constantly. This is my business partner, Mark. And there, He was tall and dreamy. Mark was the kind of guy I imagined when reading romance novels. So what brings you to Dustin's party? Mark asked after we grabbed drinks and found a quieter corner. I laughed nervously. Honestly, Jules ambushed me, told me we were having a Netflix night, and then attacked me with a curling iron. I gestured at my dress. This is all her doing. I haven't been out in months. Bad breakup? He asked gently. I nodded, looking down at my feet. No, I get it. My ex told me I was too serious because I didn't want to do shots on a Tuesday. He smiled. But for what it's worth, Jules has excellent taste. You look beautiful. I felt my face flush. I feel like I'm playing dress up. Well, you're very good at it, he said, his cheeks turning red the moment our eyes locked. We stood there for a moment. That perfect awkward pause where you both know something's happening. He was about to say something else when I heard a familiar voice behind me say, wow, look at you. This isn't like you at all. I felt all the hairs on my body stick up. My ex, Craig, stood there. Well, well, look who finally left the house. He stepped forward, stretching his arms out to hug me. Mark stepped in front and held his hand out professionally. Mark. And you are? Craig nodded with a smile. Like you sarcastically proud. Look, At you. You got yourself a looker. But I'd be careful, Mark. That dress, the makeup, the whole confident act. It's not her. Trust me. I fell for it, too. He gestured at me like I was a fraud. Mark shrugged, reaching his hand to hold mine. Thanks, but I'm happy getting to know her myself. Now, if you don't mind. Craig ignored him completely and started on his rant about me. Did she tell you she won't sleep with you for months? She has all these rules about dating, about building trust. First he actually used air quotes. But the truth is, she's boring. She won't go out to clubs with you, no big social events. Instead of flirting and fun, she wants to talk about your feelings and future. Craig laughed loudly, catching everyone's attention in the room. Oh, and get this, Craig continued, clearly enjoying himself. She has an actual bedtime, even on weekends. She'll bore you to death in a month, just like she did to me. I felt my tears quickly filling my eyes. The confidence Jules had helped me find was dissolving. Mark was seeing the real me now, the boring girl who couldn't keep her boyfriend.

There's this guy in my neighborhood who started stealing my packages about 2 months ago. At first I thought it was just bad luck when my new headphones went missing, then my coffee maker disappeared, then a birthday gift for my mom. After the fourth theft, I started tracking delivery times obsessively trying to grab packages the second they arrived. But this guy was watching too. I'd check the delivery notification, rush outside five minutes later and the package would already be gone. I saw him once. He was in his mid 30s baseball cap driving a beat up Toyota Corolla that he'd park one street over before walking to my house. He wasn't even subtle about it. He'd stroll up my driveway in broad daylight like he owned the place. I put up a no trespassing sign. He took that 2. I added a smile you're on camera sign even though I didn't have cameras yet. The next day that sign was in my recycling bin. That's when things got personal. He started leaving sticky notes on my door after stealing packages. The first one said thanks for the Bluetooth speaker sucker with a smiley face drawn on it. The next time after taking my workout supplements, he left a note saying maybe try working out your brain instead. He was taunting me when he stole my girlfriend's anniversary gift. He Actually had the nerve to leave a note saying she's too good for someone who can't even protect a package. Nice choice on the earrings, though. That one made my blood boil. I tried everything, having packages delivered to my work, but my boss shut that down. Amazon lockers were always full. I asked neighbors to grab them, but they work during the day too. The worst part was when he stole my diabetic cat special food delivery and left a note, thanks for the feast, dummy. My cat had to go without his prescription food for 3 days while I waited for a replacement. I was literally trapped. I didn't order anything to my own home. This guy was controlling my life and he was enjoying every second of it. I finally hit my limit when he stole my grandmother's medication that I'd ordered for her. The note said, Hope Granny's not in a rush. Lol. That was it. I went to the police station with all the sticky notes as evidence. The officer took my report, said they'd investigate and told me package theft was unfortunately common. They'd increase patrols. They said they'd keep an eye out, they said, but we both knew nothing would happen it. It was just petty theft to them, a property crime that wasn't worth their resources. I went home furious and started researching my options online. My first thought was a glitter bomb or dye pack, but then I found forums discussing Package protect. Turns out booby trapping packages is illegal. You can actually get sued or arrested for injuring a thief. Even a harmless glitter bomb could technically be considered assault. I was about to give up when I stumbled across a post from a lawyer explaining that tampering with federal mail is a serious federal crime, not just petty theft. Federal mail includes anything sent through USPS with proper postage. Penalties were severe, up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. That's when my plan started forming. I invested in a high quality security camera system with clear night vision and motion detection, spending nearly $500 I couldn't really afford. I made sure one camera had a perfect angle of my.

My girlfriend was so insane that she told everyone that we broke up because I cheated on her in her dream. She was a spoiled rich girl who came from a terrible snobby family. They were the kind of people who would wipe their butts with hundred dollar bills if they ran out of toilet paper. If she and I ever got into an argument, she would run back to her daddy who would send her on a week long vacation to Cancun just so she could recover from our arguments. During one of these week long vacations to Cancun, she ended up getting pregnant from one of the six hotel staff she cheated on me with. But when she came back, instead of telling me, she told me that she was breaking up with me because she had a dream in Mexico that I would cheat on her. At this point I was so over the relationship that I didn't care if it ended. After I moved out and moved back to my parents house, I got a call from an anonymous number. I picked up the phone. It was my ex girlfriend's father. He called to say, you broke my baby girl's heart. Now I'm going to break your head. I'd sleep with one eye open if I were you. I told him whatever and for him and his crazy family to leave me alone. Truthfully, I was scared of him. I knew he had enough money to hire whoever he wanted to do whatever he wanted. When I applied for a new job, I noticed someone was watching me at the office. They weren't just watching me, they were staring. When I left the building, I saw them following behind. I started to look around, and that's when I saw a black van with two men inside it, also watching me. I've seen enough movies to know what that meant, so I didn't waste any time. I started running as fast as I could. I ended up running into a park where I found a police officer. I alerted him and told him that I was being followed by three men. I thought that he would help me, but instead he told me to put my hands behind my back and that I was being arrested. I demanded that he tell me why I was being arrested, but he told me to shut my broke ass up. The second he called me broke, I realized that this was all my ex's father I was doing. He paid the cop off to arrest me. At this point, I didn't even fight back. The cop put me in his cop car, and just as I thought, he brought me to my ex girlfriend's estate. When he threw me out of the car, my girlfriend's father was waiting for me, sipping tea like a James Bond villain. I asked him if he was Going to take my life away. And all he said was, we need to talk. I followed him inside and passed by my girlfriend, who was getting her feet done. Her father sat me down and there was trembling in his voice. My babe

So I started dating a guy older than him. See how he likes it? I'm 22 and my dad is 48. Last year after my parents divorced, he started dating this 20 year old girl named Becca. Yes, she's literally two years younger than me. Disgusting, right? At first I thought it was just some midlife crisis fling. But then he started bringing her to family dinners and introducing her as his girlfriend. She'd sit there giggling at everything he said while I'm sitting across from them wanting to throw up. The worst part was watching my dad act like some teenage boy around her, buying her jewelry and taking her on fancy trips while my mom was still fighting for alimony money. Who would even try to give me advice about college and my dating life. Like, girl, you literally just graduated high school two years ago. She'd be like, oh, honey, you should totally try this new face mask I saw on TikTok while I'm thinking about how she's closer to my age than my dad's. The breaking point came when my dad announced they were moving in together. He called a family meeting with me and my little brother to tell us Becca would be around more often. My 16 year old brother just stared at his phone the whole time while I sat there fuming. That's when I decided to give my dad a taste of His own medicine.

He's divorced, has kids older than me, but he's actually pretty cool and treats me well. Plus he looks way better than my dad, even though he's older. I started bringing Robert to family events.

For 18 years, I dealt with this disaster of a name that looked like someone sneezed while typing. Every first day of school was the same nightmare. Teachers would get to my name on the roll call and just stop, dead silence. And they'd attempt some butchered pronunciation like curse style or quest illie. I'd have to raise my hand and say it's just crystal, but spelled like my parents hate me. The worst part wasn't even the pronunciation. It was the assumptions. People would see my name written down and immediately think I was some exotic foreign exchange student or that my family was super religious. Got asked if I was Muslim. At least once a week, random people would come up to me asking what country I was from or what language my name came from. I'd have to explain that, no, my parents just thought they were being creative when they were really just being cruel. My mom was the worst about it. He'd email every single teacher at the beginning of each school year with a whole paragraph about how to pronounce my name correctly and the cultural significance behind the spelling. There was no cultural significance. She just saw the name Crystal in a baby book and decided to make it look fancy. When I was 15, I started telling people to just save my name as Crystal in their phones. Made everything easier. But my mom found out when she saw a text from my friend Jess that just said Crystal, and she completely lost it. She grounded me for two weeks and made me write apology letters to all my friends explaining the proper way to spell my name. That's when I knew I was changing it.

I was 17 when I found out about the secret group chat. It happened totally by accident when I was trying to airdrop a funny video to my mom's phone. But when I looked for her device, I saw something called fam real instead of just mom's iPhone. That was weird. So when she left her phone charging in the kitchen later, I checked it out. My stomach dropped when I saw the group members, Mom, Dad, my older brother Jake, my sister Emma, and even Aunt Beth, everyone except me. I scrolled through their messages from that day. They were planning dinner at this new Italian place downtown. Jake had sent a picture of the menu and Emma was joking about how dad always orders the same pasta. Normal family stuff, except I wasn't invited. Then I saw something that made my chest tight. I had written, should we tell Natalie about dinner? Mom replied, she'll just complain about the food or say she's too busy. Dad added, let's keep it simple tonight. I kept scrolling back through weeks of messages. There were plans for mini golf, movie nights, even a trip to the zoo, all happening without me. In one conversation, Jake mentioned how they went to see the new Marvel movie. I had asked them about it the next day and they said it was sold out. The worst part was a conversation from Three months ago, Aunt Beth had written, we should probably include Natalie more. Mom's response was, she makes everything awkward. Remember her birthday dinner? Emma chimed in. She complained about the restaurant being too loud the whole time. Jake added, plus, she always has her headphones in. Anyway, my birthday dinner, the one where I wore my favorite dress and actually tried to join their conversations, thought we had a good time. Apparently, they spent the whole night annoyed with me. I found messages about a family trip to the mountains last winter. They had gone skiing for a whole weekend. When I asked where everyone was, they told me they were visiting grandma. I even texted grandma to see how she was doing, and she seemed confused about why I thought they were there. There were inside jokes I didn't understand, references to things that happened when I wasn't around. Jake had sent a picture of dad wearing Mom's reading glasses and everyone was laughing about it. Emma wrote, classic dad moment, No. 847. I had no idea what that meant. I sat in the dark kitchen reading message after message. They talked about me like I was some annoying neighbour kid, not their daughter and sister. In one thread, they were discussing Christmas plans. Aunt Beth suggested we all go to her cabin, dad wrote. Sounds great, but what about Natalie? Mom replied. We'll figure something out. My hands were shaking as I scrolled to the very beginning. Of the chat, it started eight months ago right after my 17th birthday. The first message was from Emma. Finally, we can plan stuff without drama. Jake had replied. Best birthday present ever. I heard footsteps coming toward the kitchen. I quickly close the phone and pretended to get water from the fridge. Mom walked in and smiled at me like nothing was wrong. Hey, sweetie, how was your day? I wanted to scream. I wanted to show her what I found and ask why they hated me so much. Instead, I just said it was fine and went to my room. That night, I lay in bed thinking about every family moment from the past year. All the times they said plans fell through or events were cancelled. All the times they came home laughing about something and stopped when they saw me. All the times I felt left out and thought I was being paranoid. The next morning at breakfast, they were all acting.

When I refused, she tried to get my dad to kick me out. But when I revealed the truth about who actually owns the house, everything changed. When dad married Beverly three years ago, I was 16 and still dealing with losing my mom to cancer. Beverly seemed nice enough at first, always offering to help with homework or asking about my day. But once the wedding was over, her true colours showed. She moved in with her twin boys, Austin and Blake, who were both 14. From day one, Beverly treated me like a guest who'd overstayed their welcome. She make comments like, I hope you're not planning to live here forever or most kids your age are thinking about their own place. Her son's got the good snacks, the bigger TV time and never had to do chores. Meanwhile, I was scrubbing toilets and doing their laundry while they played video games. Breaking point came last month when I turned 19. Beverly sat me down at the kitchen table with this fake sweet smile and slid a piece of paper across to me. Now that you're an adult, it's time you start paying your fair share, she said. $500 a month for rent plus splitting utilities three ways. Stared at the paper. What about Austin and Blake? They're my children. This is their home, she said, crossing her arms. You're old enough to contribute or find somewhere else to live. I told her I needed to think about it, which made her face go red. Think about it. This isn't a negotiation. You pay or you leave. That night, dad came home from his night shift at the factory. Beverly had already gotten to him. And Beverly says you're being difficult about paying rent, he said, looking exhausted. Maybe it's time you start acting like an adult dad. This is our house. The house you bought with mom before I was born. He rubbed his forehead. Beverly is my wife now. We make decisions together. If she thinks you should pay rent, then maybe you should. I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach. So her kids get to live here free, but I have to pay. That's different. They're younger. I went to my room and pulled out the folder I'd hidden under my mattress two years ago after mom died. I'd found it in her jewellery box with a note that said, for our son when he needs it. Inside, we're.

Last Friday, I left work early to surprise my wife. I had flowers and champagne. She walked in and saw me. She said, oh, you're home. Then she left to hang out with her friends. I stood there feeling stupid. This happened all the time. Every Friday, she went out with friends. Every Saturday, she had brunch with them. Every Sunday, she went shopping. But when she was home and I tried to go anywhere, she got mad. She would yell, you never spend time with me! I bought us concert tickets. She didn't go. She went to book club instead. Her sister told me at Thanksgiving, she treats you like garbage. Tom called me while I stood there. I told him. Every week at my place. Thursday, she texted me. She said she would stay home Friday night. Good. I invited five friends over to play poker. She came home happy. She thought we would watch movies together. She saw my friends playing cards. What the hell is this? She asked. Poker night, I said. Her face got angry fast. She ran upstairs. I smiled. Next Friday, she stayed home again. Eight friends came over to watch the game. She came downstairs in pajamas. She had popcorn. She saw all my friend. She turned around and went back upstairs. She didn't say anything. I didn't feel bad. Week 3, she took a day off work. I took the Day off, too. Ten friends came over. We did our fantasy football draft. She kept walking through the room. She looked angry. Steve asked if she was okay. I said, never better. Week 4 was funny. She wrote on the calendar in big red letters. It said, our night. No excuses. She circled it three times. My friends came over anyway. She tried to sit with us during video games. We ignored her. She left after 12 minutes. Week five got bad. She made dinner reservations. She reminded me six times. She bought a new dress. One hour before dinner. I texted her. Forgot poker night. She called me screaming. She said I was ruining our marriage. While she yelled at me. I put her on speaker. I asked Tom to bring chips. He heard me do it. Something broke upstairs. The house shook. Week six, she found me setting up poker tables. She started crying. Please, just tonight. Please. I didn't care. I told her my friends were counting on me. She said I was being mean. I said she taught me how to act this way. She said her friends were important. I said mine were too. She locked the bedroom. I slept on the couch. Next morning, six friends came for breakfast. She saw them. She took her keys and left. She went to her mom's house. Her parents anniversary party was the next day. 50 people were at the party. During speeches, she took the microphone. Everyone needs to hear what's happening in my marriage. She said. Everyone got quiet. She talked for two minutes. She said I chose friends over her for six weeks. She said I played poker every night. She said I had friends over every weekend. She said I was ruining our marriage. People gasped. Her mom looked shocked. Her dad looked angry at me. My wife looked happy with herself. I stood up. I asked for the microphone. Quick question. Who remembers her skipping my birthday for girls night?

I spent three years invisible at my high school. Not the shy kid who sits alone, but the one nobody remembers exists. Teachers called me by the wrong name. Kids borrowed my notes, then forgot who gave them. Even the lunch lady skipped my tray sometimes, like I wasn't standing there. So when I overheard two popular girls planning the senior prank, something inside me snapped. Because I wanted to join, but because their idea was weak. They wanted to fill the principal's office with balloons. That's it. Balloons. Like we were still in middle school. I knew I could do better, so I started planning something that would make everyone finally see me. First, I got Jake involved. He worked at his uncle's print shop and owed me for doing his chemistry homework all semester. I told him I needed 500 copies of something, but couldn't say what yet. He agreed without questions because that's how desperate he was to pass. I talked to Emma from theater. She had keys to the costume room because she managed props. I told her I needed to borrow something for one night. She handed me the keys and said, just don't get caught. The hardest part was getting into the school database. But my computer. Computer science teacher, Mr. Lopez, had been using the same password for three years. Football 2,019. I knew because he typed it in front of us every morning when he Logged in two weeks before graduation. Everything was ready. I stayed after school, pretending to work on yearbook layouts. When the building emptied out, I went to work first. I logged into the announcement system and recorded a new morning message. And I printed all 500 copies. Every single one was a different embarrassing photo from the principal's Facebook. Him doing karaoke. Him wearing a banana costume at Halloween. Him crying at his daughter's wedding. But that wasn't the best part. Using the theatre supplies, I made a perfect replica of our school mascot costume. If this one had the principal's face printed on the head, I hung it from the main hallway ceiling with fishing wire so it would drop during morning announcements. The next morning, I sat in homeroom trying not to smile. At exactly 8:15, my recorded message started playing over the speakers. But it wasn't my voice.

I smiled, congratulated the couple, and left. Monday morning, his college tuition I've been paying got canceled. I need to get this off my chest because the family drama has reached nuclear levels. I'm 34, own a successful contracting business, and I've been single most of my adult life by choice. Brooke seemed different, though. She was 29, worked in marketing, and we've been talking about moving in together. I was even thinking about ring shopping. I've been covering Kyle's college tuition for four years. My sister Kimberly divorced when Kyle was fifteen. Money was always tight, so when he got into state university, I offered to pay rather than watch him drown in student loans. Roughly one eighteen hundred dollars per month. Plus I bought him a car and covered textbooks. Total investment was pushing $80,000. Saturday was Kyle's wedding to his college sweetheart, Isabella. I was excited to bring Brooke. First time meeting my extended family. The reception was amazing until Kyle stood up for his speech. He thanked his parents, his new wife. Then his eyes landed on me with this smug grin. I also want to thank my uncle Steven for everything he's done for me. He's been like a second father. And I'm so glad he finally found someone desperate enough to date him. Brooke, you're a saint for putting up with his boring construction stories. The entire room Erupted in laughter, Kyle raised his glass like he just delivered the punchline of the century. My whole family was laughing, including Kimberly, who was practically in tears from cackling. But then I noticed something that made my blood run cold. Brooke was looking directly at Kyle's best man, Patrick, and they shared this quick, knowing look before she composed herself. I didn't make a scene. I stood up, walked over to Kyle, shook his hand, and congratulated him. Told Brooke I wasn't feeling well and needed to head home early. That night, I couldn't sleep. Something about that look between Brooke and Patrick kept bothering me. I'd seen Patrick around when I picked up Kyle from campus, but Brooke never mentioned knowing him. Sunday morning, I called Kyle, still hungover, but thought his speech was hilarious. I asked about Patrick and

I thought Doctor Martinez had seen everything, 23 years of experience, wrote the textbook on emotional regulation, had a waiting list longer than a CVS receipt. His office wall was covered in certificates, including one from the Dalai Lama. I was there because I got into a fist fight with a mall Santa. Not my proudest moment. Anger, Doctor Martinez said during our first session, is like holding a hot coal. You're only burning yourself. He had this perfectly calibrated therapist voice like NPR merged with a yoga instructor. Behind him sat a collection of stress balls shaped like world leaders heads. I noticed Nixon was particularly worn out. Session one was textbook. We explored my triggers, discussed coping strategies. He gave me a worksheet about identifying emotions. I pretended to care. He pretended to believe me. We were both professionals at this dance. Session 3, I mentioned my coworker Brad. Brad replies all to every email, even the automated ones. Brad clips his toenails at his desk. Brad pronounces it expresso and corrects others who say it right. Doctor Martinez's left eye twitched just once. Brad sounds challenging, he said, squeezing Stalin's head. Session five changed everything. I was ranting about my gym. They play the same Ed Sheeran song on repeat for three months. The same song. Doctor Martinez set down his notepad. Which song? Thinking out loud. He went pale. My gym plays shape of You four months, I've counted 847 times. By session seven, we'd abandoned all pretense. He'd pour us both coffee and we just vent. His mother in law moved in and rearranged his entire house. While he was at work. My HOA found me for my grass being 0.5 inches too tall. He got a parking ticket. While contesting a different parking ticket, I found out my ex was dating my dentist. Session 9, he told me about his colleague, Doctor Peterson. He steals my yogurt every day, writes his name on my yogurt, says he's conducting a social experiment on possession and ownership. I have a PhD from Harvard. I don't need his experiments. I need my strawberry yo plate. Session 11 was when the universe chose violence. I walked in to find him on the phone. White knuckling Churchill ceramic head. What do you mean insurance doesn't cover therapy for therapists? I am the therapy. He hung up, looked at me. My therapist just fired me. Said I was too negative. M E. I teach positivity seminars. Then his phone buzzed. Text from his teenage daughter. Dad, I'm dropping out to be an influencer. Also, I crashed your car into a subway. The restaurant, not the train. Something in his eyes changed like watching a documentary about damn failures. First a crack, then a trickle. Then you know what? He stood up eerily calm. Buddha was wrong. Nicho was wrong. Young Freud.

Figure it out. I said nothing. But I did figure it out and served her with divorce papers. She lost her mind. I'm a 37 year old insurance investigator who met Mara in 2020, recently divorced with two kids, Tyler, 13 and Elise, 11. Their bio dad was too busy with his secretary to pay child support. Mara was drowning on a part time vet clinic salary. Kids eating generic cereal for dinner. We married in 2021 with a simple arrangement. She handles cooking, cleaning, household management. I handle mortgage, utilities, groceries, cars, insurance, plus $650 monthly fun money. For two years, it worked perfectly. Mara kept the house spotless, cooked incredible dinners, managed schedules like a pro. I covered all expenses while she focused on family. Then her cousin Kendall moved in, divorced twice by 35, blamed every man for her failures. She filled Mara's head with toxic nonsense about not being anyone's servant. Red flag started small. Mara forgot my morning coffee routine she'd perfected. You have hands, Mark, figure it out. That became her mantra. Dinner coordination vanished. She used to ask what sounded good. Now I'd walk into whatever she felt like making. When I'd ask about options, I'm not running a restaurant. You eat what's made or handle it yourself. The house became a mess. Laundry piled up, dishes in the sink while she spent hours on social media. The breaking point came March 15th, 2024. I walked in after a 14 hour fraud investigation smelling pot roast. Kids were at the table, candle in my chair like she paid the mortgage. I headed for a plate, then noticed exactly four place settings, Tyler, Elise, Mara and Kendell. The pot had plenty of food left. Should I grab a plate? Mara looked up from her phone, expression ice cold. There's not enough for you. I made dinner for me and the kids. I could see plenty of food, but she dropped the bomb. Look, I don't cook for your highness. Feed yourself. The kitchen went silent. Even Kendall looked surprised. I stood there processing what just happened. The woman living rent free in my house just told me to feed myself while her cousin ate my food in my chair. I didn't explode, just I had leftover Chinese and ate at the counter. While planning her destruction that night, I removed her from every financial account, mortgage, utilities, groceries, cars, insurance, over 40 two hundred dollars monthly set up.

There were people everywhere and I could barely hear anything over the music. Music. An hour into being there, I was looking out into the lake when I noticed a floaty without anyone in it. I looked closer and could now see there was a girl laying face down in the water. It didn't look weird or anything, so I just went to get a drink. But when I looked back a minute later, I realized she still hadn't moved. I watched for a few more seconds to make sure I was really seeing this and then started to panic. I tried to yell to the lifeguards down the beach, but the music was so loud they couldn't hear me. A few other people saw it, too, and I started running down the dock to get her attention. She still hadn't moved, so I swam over and was able to flip the girl over to carry her back to the shore. A few people helped me get her out of the water, but everybody just stood there. Nobody else there knew CPR, so I had to do it myself. I pushed on her chest and blew into her mouth for 30 seconds until finally she started coughing. It was such a Huge relief she was breathing again and survived. A lot of people told me I was a hero that day and I didn't expect to hear from her again. That was until a month later when I was opening my mail and got a letter that I was now being sued. I literally couldn't believe it was real because she was suing me for touching her without consent. I had to hire a lawyer and everything and he couldn't believe she was doing this. We actually went to court and the judge asked her if she was really suing me for saving her life. She explained she was traumatized.

Thomas had this annoying habit of jumping into meetings right after I pitch something and saying, building on what she said before, presenting my exact idea as his own brilliant edition. It started small. I'd mention a client strategy in the break room and suddenly Thomas was presenting it as his breakthrough in the next team meeting. When I'd bring it up, he'd act confused. Great minds think alike. I guess the first time it happened, I thought maybe it really was a coincidence. But then it kept happening. My idea about targeting millennials through TikTok partnerships. Thomas pitched it three days later as his generational marketing breakthrough. My suggestion, to rebrand our failing product line. Suddenly, Thomas was the visionary who saw the potential for a complete company pivot. Our boss Janet ate it up every single time. Thomas had this way of presenting ideas with complete confidence, using buzz words like synergistic solutions and paradigm shifts that made everything sound more impressive than it actually was. Meanwhile, I'd sit there watching my own thoughts come out of his mouth, feeling like I was taking crazy pills. When I tried to speak up, Thomas would jump in with something like exactly what I was thinking or, or you're really getting the vision I laid out. The worst part, it was working. Thomas got promoted twice in six months while I stayed stuck in the same Role watching my ideas get credited to him week after week. Janet started calling him her rising star and mentioned him constantly in company wide emails about innovation. I started keeping a notebook, writing down every idea I shared. And when Thomas would inevitably steal, the pattern was always the same. Casual conversation with Thomas followed by him presenting my concept as his own within 72 hours. My breaking point came during our quarterly review when Janet praised Thomas for consistently bringing fresh perspectives while telling me I needed to contribute more original thinking to advance in the company. I was literally being criticized for not being creative enough while sitting next to the guy who'd built his entire reputation on stealing my creativity. That's when I decided to test something. I casually mentioned a completely fake marketing campaign idea to Thomas during lunch. What if we tried reverse psychology advertising where we tell people not to buy our product? Like please don't buy this, it's too good for you. Total nonsense. But I sold it like it was genius. Talking about how it would create psychological intrigue and drive demand through exclusivity. Thomas's eyes lit up. That's actually really interesting. The psychology of wanting what you can't have. Exactly, I said.

So I canceled their 15 thousand dollar vacation. My 1 year old's birthday party was supposed to be perfect. I spent weeks planning every detail, ordered a custom 800 dollar cake shaped like a little castle, hired a photographer, decorated our entire house with princess themes. Everything was going great until my mom walked over to admire the cake. She was holding her wine glass, gesturing wildly as she talked to my aunt about how extra I was being for a baby who won't even remember any of this. Then it happened. Her elbow knocked straight into the cake table. The beautiful three tier castle cake crashed to the floor, frosting splattering across my clean hardwood floors. Little fondant princesses scattered everywhere. Oops. She laughed, not even looking sorry. But honestly, honey, you always go way overboard. It's just a baby. She won't even remember this party. You could have gotten a 20 dollar cake from Walmart and she would have been just as happy. My sister Jessica was recording the whole thing on her phone, giggling like it was the funniest thing she'd ever seen. Oh my god. That's going straight to Instagram.

My uncle Bob shouted, here, here, from across the room. My cousin Mark was nodding along like my dad had just delivered the wisdom of the ages. The whole room was staring at me, waiting for my reaction. Some were smirking. Others looked uncomfortable but said nothing. A few were already pulling out their phones to take pictures, pictures of the cake disaster. My daughter started crying from her high chair, probably picking up on all the negative energy and tension in the room. I looked down at the destroyed cake, frosting still dripping from the table edge, then at my family's expectant faces. They wanted me to apologize, to laugh it off, to clean up their mess like I always did. They wanted me to say it's okay and accidents happen while they stood there grinning. Instead, I Didn't say a single word. I just pulled out my phone with steady hands. First, I opened the travel booking app and canceled the 15.

When I added everything up, the footage was crystal clear. Jimmy methodically collecting packages at dawn when everyone was asleep. But something felt off. Jimmy wasn't sneaking around like a typical thief. He was calm, organized, almost purposeful, reading shipping labels, carefully sorting boxes by size, treating each package with care. Instead of just grabbing and running, instead of calling the cops immediately, I decided to follow him. That's when everything changed. Jimmy wasn't keeping the packages. He walked three blocks over to Riverside Apartments, subsidized housing complex where paint peels and playground equipment stays broken. I watched for my car as he carefully read addresses matching names from shipping labels to apartment numbers written on torn pieces of paper. He left everything on doorsteps there, arranging boxes neatly, even knocking softly to let residents know deliveries had arrived. The insulin meant for my house delivered to Missus Rodriguez in 4C, whose diabetic son's prescription had been denied by insurance. Birthday toys I'd ordered for my nephew left at apartment 2B, where a single mom works three jobs. Jimmy had been playing Robin Hood with Our Amazon deliveries for months, redistributing from our wealthy suburb to families who couldn't afford what we casually order online. When I confronted him the next day, he broke down. My grandson lives there, he whispered, 8 years old, same diabetes as your daughter. I couldn't watch him ration insulin while your neighborhood throws away half of what they order. I never reported him. Instead, I started leaving extra packages on my porch with notes inside.

I was 24 and living in this absolute nightmare apartment. We're talking black mold on the bathroom walls, cockroaches that came out during the day like they paid rent to, and a landlord who treated text messages like they were written in a foreign language. Every morning I'd wake up sneezing from the mold and every night I'd hear my upstairs neighbor's TV through paper thin walls until 3 in the morning.

I called the leasing office to file a complaint, thinking they'd check security cameras or something. The woman on the phone asked for my I d number and apartment details to start the report. Normal stuff. But then she casually said, your work badge still shows cashier, right? We just need to confirm for the report. My blood went cold. Someone had looked me up. I stammered out a yes. My voice cracked when I said it. That Thursday, I found an official letter taped to my door, lease termination notice, material misrepresentation on rental application, 30 days to vacate. I called the office immediately, begging them to reconsider. I explained I'd never missed rent, that I was a model tenant, that I could pay three months in advance right now. The manager sounded genuinely sorry but said their insurance company wouldn't allow leases based on false income information. It was.

Everyone was happy. Then I asked, what time is the departure? Dad replied, you don't need to know because you're not part of us. I stood there holding the spatula I've been using to grill everyone's food for the last six hours. The backyard was packed with 40 relatives, all of them staring at me now. My three siblings suddenly found their phones. Very interesting. You can stay behind and watch all the kids, mom added with that fake sweet smile she perfected over the years. Someone responsible needs to be here. The table went quiet except for my nephew Tommy asking for more juice. I looked around at these people I'd sacrificed everything for. My entire 20s gone. I paid Dad's mortgage when he got fired from the plant, covered Lisa's entire wedding when she overspent by eight grand, took care of Mark's three kids every single weekend for three years so he could find himself Gin's car payments, Mom's medical bills, family emergencies that always seem to land on my doorstep. But I wasn't family enough for Hawaii. Uncle Pete shifted uncomfortably. Aunt Sarah looked at her plate. Even the kids sensed something was wrong. That's when I set down the spatula and smiled the same smile mom had just given me. Actually, I can't watch the kids. Dad's face turned red. What do you mean you can't? You don't Have plans? Oh, but I do. I'll be in Italy. The whole table went silent. Someone's fork clinked against a plate. Italy, Lisa finally asked, her voice small. Remember Grandma Rose, the one who supposedly left us nothing when she died five years ago? Mom's eyes went wild. I she remembered well, funny story. She actually left me her beach house in Tuscany, been renting it out ever since. You know, the inheritance lawyer called me directly since I was her caregiver those last two years while you all were too busy. Dad's mouth opened and closed like a fish. The rental income, about 12,000 a month. Five years. You do the math. I could hear Mom's sharp intake of breath. I was planning to surprise everyone tonight, share it with the whole family after we celebrated your anniversary. Even brought the deed to show you all. I pulled the folded papers from my back pocket. I'd carried them for weeks, waiting for the right moment. But since I'm apparently not part of this family.

But he had no idea what was waiting for him inside my house. Should I have warned him? Nine years ago, Logan divorced me over a massive misunderstanding. He came home early and saw my gay best friend Julian helping me try on bridesmaid dresses for his own wedding. Logan saw a man in our bedroom, jumped to conclusions and filed for divorce before I could even explain. I begged him to listen, but he blocked me everywhere Julian tried reaching out to nothing. Logan was convinced I cheated and refused to hear the truth. He wouldn't even let me speak at the divorce proceedings. His lawyer did all the talking while Logan sat there stone faced, treating me like I was some stranger who betrayed him. The worst part, we've been together for six years, six years of building a life together and he threw it all away without giving me five minutes to explain. I lost everything, our house, our dog, most of our mutual friends who believed his version of events. So I moved on, took a job at a law firm as a paralegal, worked my way up and eventually went to law school at night. It was brutal, studying until 2:00am while working full time. But I was determined to rebuild myself into someone stronger. That's where I met Asher. He was in my constitutional law study group, unlike Logan. Asher actually listened when I spoke. He believed in me, supported my dreams, and never once made me feel like I had to prove my worth. We got married three years ago and now have twin boys who are 4 years old. Fast forward to last Saturday. I'm in my kitchen making pancakes for the boys when the doorbell rings. Through the peephole, there's Logan with a massive bouquet of roses, looking like he just stepped off a magazine cover. Still handsome, still that cocky smile that used to make my heart race. I opened the door and he launched into this. Rayna, I finally Learned the truth about Julian. I ran into him at a conference last month and he told me everything. I realize now that I made a terrible mistake. I'm ready to forgive you and start over. We can have the life we always planned. I stared at him in disbelief. Forgive me.

My autistic daughter, Emma doesn't speak. She communicates through her service dog, Buddy, a golden retriever trained to alert us when she's having a meltdown or trying to communicate urgent needs. We moved to this quiet suburb specifically because Emma needed stability after years of failed treatments and school bullying. Our neighbor Karen started her campaign against us immediately. That dog barks. She complained on day one, but he had whimpered once, his alert signal that Emma was distressed. I explained about Emma's autism, how Buddy was literally her voice. Karen's response well, maybe she belongs in a special facility then. I installed cameras after that comment. Good thing I did. Emma loves routine. Every morning at 7:00am she and Buddy do rainbow time in our backyard. She arranges colored toys and patterns while Buddy sits guard. It's her therapy, recommended by three different specialists. Violent, peaceful, bothering nobody. Last Tuesday, I was inside making Emma's specific breakfast. She only eats yellow foods on Tuesdays when Buddy started his alert bark. Not aggressive. Three short barks, meaning Emma needs help now. I rushed outside to find Karen in our yard, having climbed our fence, trying to document the neglect with her phone. Emma was in full meltdown mode. When her routine gets disrupted, she self harms, hitting herself, pulling her hair. Buddy was doing his trained response, putting his body between Emma and Karen while alert barking for Me! Karen was screaming, it's attacking me! Rabbit dog! I scooped up Emma, who is now completely nonverbal and scratching at her arms. Get out of my yard! I shouted at Karen, who was still filming. This is child endangerment, she yelled back. Leaving a disabled child with a vicious animal. I'm calling CPS and animal control. I got Emma inside, gave her her weighted blanket and headphones. Buddy stayed in position guarding her. Twenty minutes later, three police cars, an animal control van and a CPS worker showed up. My hands were shaking as I opened the door. Ma'am, we've received reports of child neglect, wild endangerment and a dangerous animal attack, the lead officer said. Behind him, Karen stood in her driveway, phone out, live streaming to her Facebook group. I have cameras, I said immediately. Everything's recorded. We reviewed the footage. Right there on my porch. CPS worker watched Karen climb my fence, watched her terrify my daughter. Watched Buddy perform exactly as a 30 thousand dollar service dog should, protecting Emma while calling for help. Watched me respond immediately. The animal control officer spoke first. Ma'am, that's the best trained service animal I've seen in 20 years.

My mom looked me dead in the eye and said, if you disappeared tomorrow, no one would even notice. Everyone laughed except me. I quietly raised my hot dog and said challenge accepted. That night I packed everything into two suitcases and left my key on the kitchen counter. No, no, no. Goodbye. Just gone on. I've been the family doormat for 29 years, the one who organised every holiday, baked every birthday cake and cleaned up everyone's messes while they took selfies without me. So when mom made that joke at our B B Q with my aunts and siblings all laughing, something inside me just. I moved three hours away to a lakeside cabin, blocked everyone's numbers and started over as Jade instead of JD, the nickname that made me feel like a child. For the first week, my phone stayed silent, exactly like mom predicted. But Week 2, 2, my brother called 47 times. Turns out nobody knew how to work the washing machine I've been maintaining for years. Their clothes piled up like a laundry mountain until he finally had to buy new underwear instead of figuring out the spin cycle. Week 3, my sister showed up at my old job crying, begging my former co workers for my new number. She had a family emergency, a. K. A. Couldn't figure out how to renew her car register, the same registration I've been handling for her since she was 16. My Co workers told her I'd moved states away. She broke down in the parking lot because she'd never even Learned where the d m. V. Was located. She ended up paying $300 to some sketchy guy who promised to handle it. Month 2, Dad drove to every apartment complex in the city looking for. He never realised I was the one who remembered everyone's medication schedules, grocery lists and which bills were due when without me. He missed his blood pressure medication for three weeks and had to go to urgent care. The doctor asked if he had family support at home. Dad just stared at the floor and mumbled something about his daughter being away. Mom had a complete breakdown when she realised I've been handling all the family birthdays, anniversary reminders and doctor appointments for decades. She forgot her own sister's birthday for the first time in 40 years and had to hear about it at Sunday dinner. The woman who said nobody would notice was now hiring a professional organiser for $200 a week to do what I've done for free my entire adult life. Even then, the organiser quit after two weeks because mom kept asking her to just handle it like Jade used to. My aunt called mom crying because no one had organised the annual Christmas cookie exchange. It was complete chaos. People brought store bought cookies. Nobody knew the gift exchange rules I've been coordinating for a decade and three families showed up. On the wrong day. Meanwhile, I was learning pottery at the community center, taking morning hikes by the lake and sleeping in without someone banging on my door needing me to fix their problems before 7:00am. For the first time in my life, my calendar belonged to me. Last week, mom finally tracked down my number through my old college roommate, Sarah, who she'd somehow found on LinkedIn after call.

They gave him chalk, he taught math, and the class swore he was better than the real teacher.

Some famous rapper doing community outreach just casually dropped by, signed back packs, freestyled in the gym, even crowned the Dodgeball Champion. CEO of recess. All my friends have selfies, I have an empty cereal bowl.

She went this way. Check sector 7. They're hunting me like an animal, she whispered. These camps are legal because parents sign custody over. If they catch me, I disappear. Forever. Other kids have disappeared. That's when my viewer, Kevin, a tech genius from Seattle, spoke up. Turn on your location sharing now. Screenshot and send it to the chat. She did. Middle of nowhere Utah, 40 miles from the nearest town. Kevin immediately started working magic. I'm overlaying your position with Google Earth. There's a road 800 meters northeast at that way. How do you know this is real? Someone challenged. The girl, laughed bitterly. Google Wilderness Reformation Academy, Utah. Check their reviews. Parents praising them for fixing their kids. Kids who never post anything again. After my viewer count hit 500, someone had already clipped this and it was spreading across.

They're doing a head shaving fundraiser at work. We should do it together. Make it a couple's thing. My coffee mug slipped. Hot coffee everywhere. Shit. Sorry. I let me get a towel. But I wasn't thinking about the coffee. I was thinking about the scar that runs from my left temple across the top of my head down to behind my right ear. The one I got when I was 8 when my uncle was drunk driving and flipped his truck with me in it. The one that left me with a scalp looks like a poorly drawn road map where hair refuses to grow in thick angry patches. You okay, Christopher asked? Mopping up coffee with paper towels. You went super pale. Yeah. Just when is it this Saturday? Come on, it'll be fun. You're always saying you want to try new things fun, right? Here's what Christopher doesn't know. Every morning I wake up 30 minutes before him, lock myself in the bathroom and carefully position my wig on the Styrofoam head I hide in The linen closet. On our wedding night, I insisted on keeping the lights off, become an expert at avoiding pools, declining spa days with his sister, lie after lie, building a wall between us one excuse at a time. By Friday, I was googling how to tell your husband you've been lying for five years at 3:00am while he slept beside me. Saturday morning came anyway. Christopher was practically vibrating with excitement. He'd raised $500 for the charity. There would be photos. Everyone would be watching him shave his wife's head and find out she's been bald and scarred this whole time. In the car, I started crying. Not pretty tears, the ugly kind that come with snot and hiccups. Whoa. Hey, Christopher pulled over immediately. What's wrong if you don't want to do this? I can't. That's okay. You don't have to. No, Christopher, I can't. I reached up with shaking hands and pulled off my wig. The silence in that car was the loudest thing I've ever heard. I couldn't look at him. I stared at the wig in my lap. This thing I'd hidden behind for so.

I was walking down the street when these two girls I've never seen before called my name. Ryan. This is super weird, but our best friend's baby shower is happening right now. Can you please pretend to be her boyfriend and father? I did a double take. They looked so desperate. Her ex is insane. He tried to burn their house down while she was in. He's gonna show up at some point and we need someone who can scare him off. I'm 6 feet, 4 inches and apparently look like I eat nails for breakfast. So I get why they picked me, but this was insane. How do you even know my name? Your gym bag, one said, pointing at the tag. Please, he said he's coming at three PM to reclaim what's his. It's 2:15. Against every logical thought, I followed them into this house covered in pink balloons and baby girl banners. The living room was packed with women who all turned to stare at me. Then I saw her, Becky from my comparative lit class freshman year, the girl I spent an entire semester trying to work up the courage to talk to. Now eight months pregnant, looking exhausted, it seemed like the worst joke the universe has ever played. Everyone, this is Ryan. The girls announced the father. Becky's eyes went wide recognizing me, but she played along. Hey, babe, she said weakly. Her friend pulled me aside. Richard's been sending videos all morning. He's unhinged. Just stand there and look protective until he shows up and leaves. I stood by Becky's chair while she opened presents. The party tried to feel normal, but everyone was tense. Her phone buzzed. She showed me a video from Richard on my way to get what's mine. Hope you didn't think you could replace me. This is the sixth one today, Becky whispered. An older woman, maybe an aunt, said quietly to another guest, remember when Richard threw that bottle at her head at Christmas? Becky's mom approached me. Thank you for doing this. Last time he showed up somewhere, he broke her friend's nose for interfering. Another video came through at 2:30. Richard in his truck. Tell everyone to clear out unless they want problems. The room got quieter. People kept glancing at the windows. At 2:40, another text. Nice pink decorations. Almost there. A friend mentioned he knows which house he's probably driving by. Becky tried to focus on opening a baby onesie. Her hands were shaking. Last time he came to a party, someone whispered. Four people went to the er. At 2:50, Becky's phone rang. She put it on speak.

My friend Stella called me crying, begging me to watch her kids for a few hours because her mom just had a heart attack. I got to her house and her taxi was already backing out of the driveway. She rolled down the windows to warn me that her ex husband Ryan had lost custody last month after he broke Josh's arm and had been driving by the house lately. I didn't even get to respond before she sped off. The kids were watching TV when I got inside. Eight year old Ava looked up at me with wide eyes and asked, are you staying with us until mom gets back? I told her yes. Josh whispered, he's not supposed to come here. The judge said. He got mad because I spilled juice and grabbed my arm and twisted it until it snapped. Ava added, if he comes here, we're supposed to hide and call 9, 1 1. Mom taught us. I made them popcorn and we settled in to watch a movie. But both kids kept glancing at the windows. Every car that passed made them tense up. Then headlights swept across the living room. As a car pulled into the driveway. Ava grabbed my arm so hard her nails dug in. That's Dad's car. Josh started shaking beside me. Three hard knocks rattled the door. Ryan called out. Ava, Josh, it's daddy. Open up. Both kids scrambled behind the couch, Josh covering his cast Protectively, Ava was crying silently, her whole body trembling. More, knocking harder. This time, Ryan shouted, I know you're in there. I saw someone through the window. Don't make daddy angry. I looked through the people. A man in a wrinkled dress shirt was standing there swaying slightly. Even from here, I could smell the alcohol. Ryan yelled, kids, I can hear the TV. Just visited grandma this morning. Guess the stress was too much for her old heart. My blood went cold. I pulled out my phone to call 9, But Ryan must have heard because he pressed his face, face against the door and said, I know Stella's not there. I watched her leave running to the hospital. Is she? I stayed quiet, dialing with shaking fingers. Ryan screamed, this is my house, and started pounding with both fists. Josh, you know what happens when you don't listen. The kids were sobbing now. The pounding stopped and I heard footsteps walking away. I peeked through the side window and saw Ryan going to his car. He opened the trunk and pulled out a tire iron. Ryan shouted, last chance, open this door or I'm coming in. I grabbed both kids and ran upstairs to the bathroom. Ava whispered, lock the door. He can't break the lock. We tried before. The sound of glass shattering came from downstairs. He'd smash the front window. We could hear him knocking out the remaining glass, then climbing through. Ryan's voice. Came from downstairs. Calmer now, which was somehow worse. Where are my kids? Daddy just wants to talk, tell you all about my morning visit with grandma. I was on with 9 1 1, whispering our address. The dispatcher said units were coming but to stay hidden. Heavy footsteps on the stairs. Ryan called out. She looks so surprised to see me. Started clutching her chest right away. Should have seen her face when I told her what Stella's been planning. The kids looked at each other in horror. The footsteps stopped outside the bathroom. The door knob turned slowly. Ryan sang, found you. Then a massive bang as he kicked the door. The wood cracked but held. Another kick and the frame started splintering. Ryan screamed, you can't hide from me, and kept kicking. In kicks. He yelled, Josh, remember what happened to your puppy when you tried to tell the teacher about daddy? Josh started hyperventilating and Ava had to cover his mouth to muffle his sobs. The kicking got harder and more pieces of the door frame flew off. Ryan shouted, I've got all night and when I get in there, we're going to have a family meeting about respect. The door was barely holding together when we heard sirens in the distance. Ryan must have heard them because the kicking got frantic. He yelled, open this door. They're my kids. The door finally gave way, hanging off its hinges. Ryan stood there with a tire iron Face purple with rage, breathing hard from the exertion. He looked at Josh's cast and smiled. Want me to match the other arm? Josh screamed, and I pulled both kids behind me. Ryan asked, who are you? You think you can keep me from my kids? He stepped into the bathroom and raised the tire iron above his head. I pushed the kids into the bathtub and grabbed the shower curtain rod, holding it up to block him. But he laughed and swung the tire iron, knocking it out of my hand so hard my palms went numb. He raised the tire iron again, aiming for my head this time, and I covered the kids with my body, waiting for the impact. Red and blue light suddenly flooded through the window. Ryan looked back, then at the kids. He started saying, tell them you want to come with daddy. Tell them or. A police officer's voice came from downstairs. Police, drop the weapon, I screamed. Up here. He's got a weapon. Two officers appeared in the doorway. Weapons. Ryan dropped a tire iron and raised his hand, saying, these are my kids. I have rights. One officer commanded, step away from them now. They cuffed him and started leading him out. At the top of the stairs, Ryan turned back with his horrible smile. Ryan screamed, check the trunk of her car. Go check what's in Stella's trunk. Check what she did. The officer stopped for a second, looking at Each other then continued dragging him down the stairs. I stood there holding the crying kids, my hands shaking, wondering what he meant. Through the broken window, I could see Stella's car still parked in the driveway, the trunk barely visible in the darkness. Ava looked up at me with wide eyes and asked, what's in Mommy's trunk?

My little sister was groomed and assaulted by a 41 year old man when she was 11. He left her barely breathing and with enough internal damage so she would never have a menstrual cycle to pour salt in the wound. When the day of sentencing came, the judge ruled that there was not enough evidence of intended bodily harm to give this monster more than 10 years. We were devastated. And to make matters even worse, he was let out on good behavior. 48 months later, that's when he struck again. He tracked down another girl from our town, assaulted and killed her in her own home. This time our entire community went into uproar. We collectively got him served with not only a life sentence but the death penalty too. But still, that didn't change the fact another family was destroyed. And when my little sister took her own life a few months later because of her trauma, I knew I had to start tracking these monsters down on my own. That night I created a fake IG profile of a 14 year old girl named Sophie. The amount of texts I received from grown men within just 72 hours made me wanna throw up. I never told anyone about the account either. I simply texted these men, promised them a good time at a certain location, then I'd meet them with crowbars and baseball Bats force them to beg for their life before leaving them permanently disabled ever every time. I did that to seven different men and never felt an ounce of remorse. But then I started texting a man named Grayson. He was very apprehensive about Sophie at first, saying he knew it was wrong, but it felt so right. Right around this time is when I noticed my older brother started acting strangely. He was 24 and had never been in love, but was suddenly smiling at his phone like a giddy teenager. He was oddly protective of it, too. I'd sometimes tease him about his obvious new girlfriend, but instead of smiling or getting shy, he'd literally lock up and run to his room where he'd immediately change all the passwords to his phone and computer. The more secretive and addicted to his phone my brother got, the more Grayson became infatuated with Sophie. He started sending her money for manicures and shopping trips, which directly coincided with my brother picking up extra shifts at the warehouse job. Still, my brother's name was Benji, so I never thought anything. I continued leading on, spending 12 weeks wrapping him around my finger until he would have swam to Antarctica if Sophie told him to. I finally made my move when I asked him to meet me at the park at 1:00am. He said yes. Immediately I started getting dressed in all my black outfit around midnight when I heard my brother's Door creek open. I listened to him go downstairs and exit as quietly as possible. I still thought he was going to another overnight shift. I gathered all my things, include in my backpack and crowbar and made my way to the park. I got there 15 minutes early and waited in the bushes. Sure enough, at exactly 1 a. M, I saw Grayson by the fence waiting for Sophie. That's when I made my move, the same thing I've done seven times. I snuck around the edges of the park so he wouldn't see me and slowly started creeping up behind him. By the time I got to him, my crowbar was in my hand. I had no intention of anything less than breaking his legs. I tap his shoulder softly. Sophie, he said, turning around. That's when I saw his face and my body froze. It was Benji, my brother. He went pale when he saw a man in a black mask staring at him. He couldn't tell who I was. All he knew was that this was a setup. He started running away like they always do, but this time I was too shocked to immediately chase him. I couldn't even process anything. I felt my body just take off after him. I eventually tackled him to the ground where we ended up wrestling and he.

My cousin laughed. Wait, that was yesterday. My aunt showed photos, everyone smiling. My sister muttered, maybe take the hint. I stayed silent. But what I did next wiped their smiles. I should have known something was wrong the second my cousin laughed. It was the night after my nephew Liam's 7th birthday. I'd stayed late rinsing plates, still buzzing from the way his face lit up when I gave him the Lego set he begged for. For once, I felt included. So I said it without thinking. Can't wait for the big family dinner tomorrow. Tara froze, then burst out laughing. Wait, you don't know that was yesterday. My stomach dropped. My aunt casually pulled out her phone, swiping through photos, a long table with fairy lights, champagne toasts, speeches, the annual reunion dinner, the one my mom always hosted, the one I've been at every year, and somehow I wasn't there. Oh, this is right before dessert, my aunt said. That's when your mom gave her speech about being surrounded by all her blessings. Her words shattered me. I turned to my sister. She didn't look up from the dish towel. Maybe take the hint next time, she muttered. Silence. My throat locked. I set the sponge down, picked up Liam's birthday card, stuffed with a gift card, and slipped out the door. On the drive home, her words echoed, take the hint, not cruel. Not angry, just fact like I've been stupid to keep showing up. That night I replayed every forgotten invite, every missing group chat, every photo I wasn't in. It wasn't mistakes, it was policy. I wasn't. Family fine then. They could live without me. For years, I've been funding everything behind the scenes. College savings for me as kid, emergency dental work, Mom's roof repairs, all hidden as anonymous grants from my LLC. I never asked for credit, just wanted to help. The morning after, mom called in a panic. The AC is out 8 grand. The guy you usually work with said the.

My best friend Ian and I were eating lunch when two massive seniors decided we were sitting in their spot. The bigger one, Craig, dumped my tray over my head while his friend Jeremy laughed, saying freshmen weren't allowed in the senior section, even though there wasn't a senior section and everyone knew it. Ian tried to say we'd move, but Craig snapped his glasses in half and dropped them in his chocolate milk, asking if he could see better now. My fists were shaking under the table, but I forced them open because sensei always said karate was only for Protection, never for being pissed off. Jeremy saw my anime backpack and told the whole cafeteria we were those weird kids who run with our arms behind our backs, which never did. But now half the cafeteria had their phones out. Craig took Ian's inhaler and pumped it empty while Ian wheezed that he actually needed it to breathe, and they just laughed harder. When they told us to show our sick anime fighting skills and we said no, Jeremy swept Ian's legs and he crashed face first, his elbow bleeding everywhere on the nasty cafeteria floor. I helped Ian up while Craig went through our phones, reading our texts about robotics club out loud like it was the funniest thing ever. He found a photo of Ian's Little sister and said she was hot and maybe he'd find her after school. And Ian actually tried to grab his phone, but Jeremy shoved him into the wall so hard a picture frame shattered. Craig made us pick up every piece of glass with our bare hands while everyone watched. And Ian whispered, dude, why won't you do something? I know you can. But I just shook my head, because once I started, I didn't know if I could stop. Next day, they were waiting with zip ties and attached our backpacks backwards, so we looked like idiots walking to class. Jeremy filmed it, saying, this is what happens to kids who think life is like anime, where we kids suddenly get powerful, except in real life, we kids just get destroyed. When teachers asked what happened, Craig stood right behind us, so we knew we had to say it was just a joke or whatever. And Mrs. Johnson definitely saw Craig's hand on my shoulder, but turned away like she didn't. Craig said tomorrow they'd give us swirlies in every bathroom in school. And Jeremy said his college brother wanted to meet us, and he hazed actual adults, so imagine what he'd do to freshman.

My mother only wanted to starve one of her children, me, not my perfect sister with her size 0 homecoming dress, just me, the eldest daughter who took up too much space. When I was 11, we were all sitting around the table when my dad asked, why is Lauren's my name plate empty? Before I could speak, I felt Mom's perfectly manicured nails dig into my shoulders. She already ate. Had a big snack after school, didn't you, honey? My dad ruffled my hair, distracted. And from there, my mom got crafty. My dad's 16 hour shifts meant meal time was her territory. By the time I turned 13, the routine was carved in stone. Every morning at 6:00am, while dad was in the shower, mom would make me stand on the scale she kept in her closet. 65 pounds she'd announced that particular morning. Her voice tight with disappointment, up two pounds from yesterday. No breakfast or lunch today. But mom, the doctor said I'm growing. I was then cut off by the sound of her pulling out the lunch boxes. My little sister Ava's got a sandwich, cookies, apple juice. Mine got three celery sticks and a single rice cake. Mom, please, I'm, shh. I pressed a finger to her lips. Do you hear that? That's dad's shower turning off unless you want Ava to skip meals, too. You'll smile and say goodbye like a good girl. And I never told my dad directly, but I gave signs. Is it normal to feel dizzy when you stand up? I asked him once over dinner, my mom's laugh was light and airy, like an empty stomach growling. You know how dramatic teenage girls can be. I was the same at her age. By winter, things were falling apart in ways even mom couldn't hide. My hair was coming out in clumps, leaving them in the bathroom sink because I was too tired to clean up. And after I got caught fainting at school, my punishment was watching the family eat pizza while I had ice water. Dad texted that he was coming home early and mom scrambled to make me a plate that looked normal from a distance. When he walked in, he relaxed. Good, everyone's eating. That was when I stopped fighting. I looked in the mirror one morning and didn't see the skeleton everyone else saw. I saw what mom had been telling me for years, too much space, too much flesh, too much everything. You're right, I told her at breakfast. I'm disgusting. I don't deserve food. For the first time in two years, she looked uncertain. Well, maybe just a quarter of an apple. No, I'm too fat for food. You were right, mom. You see, we both knew if I didn't eat anything, I would die. I was too depressed at that point to Care anymore. But to mom, it would mean lawsuits, dates, potential life in prison. Dad noticed at dinner that night. Where's Lauren's late. I'm not hungry, I said, my voice flat. The room went silent except for my stomach. It was growling so loud it sounded angry. She's mom started, but for once, she didn't have a lie ready. I have.

When my daughter was 16, she got rear ended by a drunk driver while stopped at a red light. The guy was clearly wasted, failed three sobriety tests. But somehow his expensive lawyer was trying to blame my daughter for the accident. The crash left her with a concussion and whiplash. She missed two weeks of school and had to quit her job at the local coffee shop because she couldn't handle the physical demands anymore. But this lawyer was determined to prove she was somehow at fault. During the deposition, he kept asking the same questions over and over, trying to confuse her or get her to contradict herself. My daughter has always been sharp, but head injuries can affect your memory. So I was worried about how she'd handle his aggressive tactics. Lawyer starts with this condescending tone. Now, Miss Johnson, you claim you were completely stopped at the intersection, correct? Yes, sir. The light was red. But how can you be absolutely certain you were stopped? Isn't it possible you were still slowing down? Because my car has something called brakes and I use them. The stenographer smiled, but the lawyer wasn't amused. He kept pushing. You were on your phone at the time of the accident, weren't you? No, I wasn't. Come now, you're a teenager. All teenagers are on their phones constantly. Surely you were texting someone. I wasn't on my phone. I Find that very hard to believe. What teenager isn't on their phone while driving? That's when my daughter looked him dead in the eye and said, the kind whose parents actually taught her how to drive responsibly. Maybe if more adults acted like adults instead of getting drunk and driving into teenagers, we wouldn't need to have these conversations. The room went completely silent. The lawyer's face turned red, but he kept going. Let's talk about your alleged injuries. Concussions are very convenient because they're impossible to prove, aren't they? Actually, they showed up on my CT scan. But I'm not a doctor. Are you? I'm asking the questions here, young lady. Right. But you just asked me if concussions are impossible to prove. And I'm telling you mine was proven by medical imaging. So either you don't understand how CT scans work or you're asking questions you already know the answers to just to waste everyone's time. Our lawyer was trying not to smile. The other guy was getting flustered. Miss Johnson, isn't it true that you've been milking these so called injuries for attention and to get out of school? Yes, because nothing says fun teenage experience like massive headaches, memory problems and having to quit the job I loved. I definitely gave myself a concussion just to miss my AP chemistry test. The sarcasm was thick and even the court reporter was stifling a laugh. But the lawyer wasn't done. He pulled out a photo on his Phone and showed it to her. This is a picture from your Instagram account posted 3 days after the accident. You're smiling. If you were really injured, would you be posting happy photos? My daughter looked at the photo, then back at him with this completely deadpan expression.

When I proposed, my girlfriend, Charlotte slumped to the floor and started crying, screaming yes over and over while jumping into my arms and running in circles. But then she saw the ring up close as I was putting it on her and her face turned sour. She still let me put it on her finger, but her hand was shaking and she kept staring at it like she couldn't believe what she was seeing. On the drive home, she kept her ring hand covered in her lap instead of admiring the ring like I'd expected. And when I asked if she liked it, she said, I just can't believe you pick this in this weird, hollow voice. I thought maybe she was just overwhelmed by the proposal. But when we got home, she immediately took the ring off and put it in the box, saying she didn't want to damage it. We almost had a fight over it when she almost forgot to put it back on. The next morning, we went to brunch with our parents and that's when her mom saw it. She literally gasped. Her dad didn't even seem happy or say congratulations. Just asked if I was trying to make some kind of statement. When I said no, I just thought it was beautiful, he exchanged this look with his wife like they were communicating telepathically. Charlotte's mom pulled her aside and I heard her whisper You don't have to go through with this, which made no sense because they'd always loved me. Charlotte posted our engagement announcement on social media but cropped out the photo of the ring, saying the lighting wasn't good. Her friends asked to see it. In the comments, she kept making excuses about waiting to get professional photos taken. Her best friend Mia came over that night and when Charlotte showed her the ring, Mia just said, oh, my god, he actually did, and left without even congratulating us. I posted in three different wedding forums asking for advice about why everyone was acting strange about the ring and included detailed photos from every angle. Every single post got deleted within minutes and I was banned from two forums for obvious rage bait and trolling the community with offensive content. One moderator messaged me saying, if the photos were real, I should be ashamed of myself. At work, I mentioned getting engaged and my coworker asked to see the ring photo on my phone. She looked at it for about 2 seconds before handing my phone back like it was contaminated and saying, that's certainly a choice. By lunch, everyone in the office was spring and my manager pulled me aside to say that while my personal life was my business, I should be mindful of professional boundaries. I went back to the jeweler thinking maybe there was something wrong. The jeweler remembered me and said he stood by his work. And the ring was exactly what I'd asked for, with genuine materials and expert craftsmanship. When I asked if other customers had issues with similar designs, he said he'd never made another ring like this and probably never would again. Charlotte started wearing the ring only when we were alone and keeping it in the box whenever we went anywhere. When I confronted her, she said she just didn't want to lose it. But I could tell she was lying. Her sister saw it at family dinner and immediately said, please tell me that's not the real ring. And when Charlotte nodded, her sister actually left the table. I asked my mom what she thought, and when I showed her the picture, she went completely silent before asking if I bought it as a joke. When I said no, she asked if I've been having mental health issues and suggested I see someone. Charlotte's friends started declining our wedding planning meetings, and her cousin, who'd agreed to be a bridesmaid, backed out, saying she had scheduling conflicts. When we went to look at venues, the wedding coordinator saw the ring and asked if we were sure we wanted to move forward with looking. Charlotte started crying in the car afterwards, saying she couldn't do this anymore. I, I begged her to just tell me what was wrong with the ring, but she kept saying, if I couldn't see it myself, then that was the whole problem. I examined it under A magnifying glass looking for hidden symbols or offensive imagery. But it looked completely normal to me. I even had it appraised by a different jeweler who said it was worth exactly what I paid and was certainly unique but technically well made. After two months, Charlotte said she needed to talk and gave me the ring back. She said she tried to be okay with it because she loved me, but she couldn't marry someone who would think that ring was acceptable. She said her friends and family had staged an intervention asking her what kind of person would give that ring and she couldn't defend me anymore. When I asked one last time what was wrong with it, she just shook her head and said the fact that you genuinely don't know makes this so much worse. She left and blocked my number. And when I tried to sell the ring online, the listing got flagged and removed within hours. Even pawn shops wouldn't take it with one owner saying he didn't want that kind of energy in his store. I kept the ring in my apartment and looked at it every single day trying to understand what everyone else saw that I didn't see. It was literally a classic oval shaped diamond with small sapphires around the band because blue was Charlotte's favourite colour. I thought it was just a beautiful, normal ring, but I had no idea how wrong I was. Full story where the truth Is revealed on the channel below.

Crystal. My parents actually looked at a Newborn baby and thought, let's spell Crystal like we're trying to unlock a cheat code. For 18 years, I dealt with this disaster of a name that looked like someone sneezed while typing. Every first day of school was the same nightmare. Teachers would get to my name on the roll call and just stop, dead silence. And they'd attempt some butchered pronunciation like curse style or quest illie. I'd have to raise my hand and say it's just crystal, but spelled like my parents hate me. The worst part wasn't even the pronunciation. It was the assumptions. People would see my name written down and immediately think I was some exotic foreign exchange student or that my family was super religious. I got asked if I was Muslim at least once a week. Random people would come up to me asking what country I was from or what language my name came from. I'd have to explain that, no, my parents just thought they were being creative when they were really just being cruel. My mom was the worst about it. She'd email every single teacher at the beginning of each school year with a whole paragraph about how to pronounce my name correctly and the cultural significance behind the spelling. There was no cultural significance. I just saw the name Crystal in a baby book and decided to make it Look fancy. When I was 15, I started telling people to just save my name as Crystal in their phones. Made everything easier. But my mom found out when she saw a text from my friend Jess that just said Crystal and she completely lost it. She grounded me for two weeks and made me write apology letters to all my friends explaining the proper way to spell my name. That's when I knew I was changing it. The second I turned 18, the day after my birthday, I marched down to the courthouse with all my paperwork. The clerk was super nice about it. She even.

You're not welcome at the wedding. My mom smirked. Good to know, I said. Pulled back the 6,500 dollar honeymoon fund, canceled the flights and by morning had 6, 7 missed calls plus one message that changed everything. It was a Tuesday when the text came through. Just three words, we all agreed. At first I wasn't sure what it meant, but my stomach already knew. A minute later, my phone buzzed again. This time it was a full sentence from my mom. We all agreed, you're not welcome at the wedding. No punctuation, just that smug little dash she always used when she wanted to sound formal, like a smirk in text form. I reread it three times waiting for it to change. It didn't. My sister's wedding, the one I helped pay for, the one I planned half of because Sarah was too stressed to deal with florists and vendors, the one where I wired $1,500 for centerpieces that looked like Pinterest sneezed on a florist shop. I wasn't just invited. I've been the backbone, or so I thought. I didn't respond. Instead, I opened my laptop and logged into the travel portal. Two business class honeymoon tickets under my email, cancel, $3,800 refund. Then I wired $6,500 the Honeymoon Overflow fund I'd sent to mom back to my savings. I felt nothing, no anger, no sadness, just calm, like I'd finally exhaled after years of holding my breath. By eight seventeen PM, Sarah was calling. Then Mom, then cousins. I turned my phone face down. By morning, 23 missed calls, one voicemail from dad. You need to see this now. Dad doesn't meddle. He's quiet, deliberate. If he stepped in, it mattered. I called. He picked up on the second ring. Kyle, he said softly, they told everyone you chose not to come. I blinked. What? They said you backed out, that you were bitter. Your mom even told Sarah's in laws you threatened to ruin the wedding if you showed up. My laugh was sharp, humorous. So they exile me and then make it my decision? It's worse, dad said. I told people you refused to fund the honeymoon out of spite. I went. Still, I already did fund it. They don't care, he said quietly. Something cracked in me, not rage, not grief, clarity. That night, dad forwarded me screenshots. Mom, Sarah and ants in a group chat. Don't worry about Kyle. He's just bitter. No one's ever loved him enough to marry him. He's a ghost. Let him fade. No seat, no speech, no drama. I deleted the screenshots. I, I didn't need to read them twice. I already knew I wasn't family. I was furniture. So I started dismantling the house. I've been holding up Mom's phone plan, suspended Sarah's Venmo, unlinked from my bank, payments on her student loan, canceled every streaming account. Profiles deleted and the venue deposit still under my name. I canceled it. By Thursday, the polite email Came through, your reservation has been terminated, deposit forfeited unless a new booking is secured. Let them explain that to 118 guests. Friday morning, I got an email from Linda, the groom's mom, formal direct.

My daughters are on the same dance team, 14 and 16. And last weekend they won a big competition. They'd worked their asses off for it, and honestly, I was so proud of both of them. My. My dad, their grandpa was there too. And right after the awards, he turns to us and goes, let's celebrate. Dinner's on me. Anywhere you girls want. My older daughter didn't even hesitate. She said, can we please go to that seafood place with the all you can eat crab legs? And when I tell you this girl has been asking to go there for years, I'm not exaggerating. It's expensive as hell, so we've always passed on at this time. My dad smiles and says, let's do it. Then my younger daughter immediately chimes in, I want Mexican. Her favorite restaurant, the one we go to all the time. It's nearby, cheap, comfortable. We've probably eaten there 50 times already. I get it. She was excited, too. She wanted her own little victory meal. But I told her, sweetheart, we always go to your place. Sister's been waiting years for this crab like place. This is a once in a blue moon thing. Let's make it special. She groaned, rolled her eyes, muttered something about how she wouldn't like anything there. I told her the menu had more than just seafood. Steak, pasta, chicken, plenty of options. She just kept Sulking, we get to the restaurant and right away she starts acting like someone lit a fire under her nose. It smells weird in here. I'm like, okay, but we've got a whole menu to look at. I order her steak medium, just how she likes it. She doesn't even touch the bread. Just sits there, arms crossed, like we dragged her into a torture chamber. Meanwhile, my older daughter is living her best life. Smiling, laughing, cracking crab legs like she's in a food commercial. Everyone else is in a good mood. My mom tries to include the younger one in the conversation, asks her about the competition, and she just shrugs. One word answers, staring off into the corner like she's punishing the air around her. Food arrives. The steak looks amazing, juicy, seasoned perfectly. She takes one bite, maybe two, and pushes the plate away. I ask what's wrong? I'm not hungry. I say, you literally begged for steak last week. She shrugs. I'm just not in the mood. I try to keep my cool, tell her she doesn't have to eat if she doesn't want to. At the end of the meal, everyone's full and happy. Except my dad says, alright, pick your dessert to go, everyone. Then he looks at my younger daughter and goes, well, I guess you don't want anything since you're not hungry. And that's when her face changed, like she didn't expect someone else to call her out. I told my Dad to drop it. But she was already fuming. We get home and I pull her aside. I tell her, listen, not everything is always going to go your way. Sometimes you've got to let someone else have a win. Especially your sister. She deserved tonight. I tell her I'd take her to the Mexican place later in the week if she wants. She snap, it's not the same. The dinner after the competition is special. And we went somewhere I hated. I said, you don't even know if you hated it. You didn't try. You just decided to be miserable. She fired back, you know I hate seafood. Why would you even take us there after something so important to me? She stewed over it for days. Monday, silent. Tuesday, Sulky. Wednesday, barely talking to anyone. Then this morning, all cheery, like nothing happened. She goes, so are we going to the Mexican place tomorrow? Just like that. Like the whole meltdown never happened. I looked at her and said, no, not this week. Her face dropped. Completely blind sided. She goes, what? Why? And I said, because of how you acted. That night wasn't about food. It was about celebrating something special together. And you made it about you. She didn't say anything. Just stood there. Hurt, angry? Maybe both. But I'm not rewarding that shit. Not after the way she acted. Not after she ruined a moment her sister waited years for.

My boyfriend Nathan told me this while we were getting ready for his company holiday party tonight. We need to act like we're not together, he said. While messing with his watch. I stopped putting on my makeup and look at him. What? Just don't tell anyone you're my girlfriend. Don't hold my hand. Don't stand near me. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. We've been together for two years. He let out this annoyed sigh, like I was being ridiculous. My boss only promotes single guys. He thinks relationships make you weak, less focused. I've been telling him I'm single since I started gunning for this promotion three months ago. I felt my stomach drop. Three months of lying about me. He said everyone brings plus one, so it would look weird if he came alone. But I had to pretend to be someone from his apartment building. The promotion decision was Monday. I looked at him in the mirror and felt something shift inside me. I put on my earrings real slow. Okay, Nathan, whatever you need. The second we got there, Nathan walked in way ahead of me, like he didn't even know me. I headed straight to the bar where his coworker Brian was getting a drink. I don't think we've met, Brian said with a friendly smile. I'm Nathan's neighbour from his building. It was the cover story Nathan wanted. Brian Smiled bigger and got me a drink. We were talking for about 20 minutes when he asked, are you seeing anyone? I looked over at Nathan, who was pretending I didn't exist. No, I'm single. Brian's whole face lit up. Wanna meet my buddy Louise from accounting? He waved over a guy from across the room. Louise was actually really charming and kept touching my arm while we talked. Nathan showed up at the bar acting like he just needed a drink. Nathan, meet this gorgeous woman who lives in your building. Louise was excited. Nathan had to shake my hand like we were complete strangers. Nice to meet you, he said, and I could hear how mad he was. You too, I said back. Louise jumped right back in. I was just about to get her number. He handed me his phone. I typed my number in while Nathan stood there, his jaw clenching. About 10 minutes later, Nathan's boss came over to our group. Who's this lovely lady? He asked with this big smile. She's single and lives in Nathan's building, Louise announced, looking pretty proud of himself. The boss's eyes got all bright. Nathan, you seeing this? While you're focused on work, Louise is out here meeting beautiful women from your own building. Nathan forced out this fake laugh. His boss kept going, though. This is what I mean. You stay single, you stay hungry. Relationships kill ambition. No offense. He turned to me when he said, That last part. None taken. I agree completely. I was looking right at Nathan when I said it. The boss just wouldn't stop. Nathan here is my best example. Three months without a single date. That's dedication. That's why he's getting promoted. Monday, everyone raised their glasses to toast Nathan's promotion. I raised mine, too. To staying single, I said, staring straight at Nathan. His hand was literally shaking when he took a drink.

But those words LED to a rebellion no one saw coming. Our homeroom teacher, Mister Gambino announced that new rule like it was a new federal law. If you're even one minute late, don't bother entering the class. I'll Mark you absent anyway. I was stunned and asked him, but Mister Gambino, what if we encounter traffic or if the previous teacher keeps us late? I don't care. I've had enough of students thinking they can arrive whenever they want. You being unable to manage your time doesn't come instigate a problem on my part. He looked around the room pointing fingers at each student who'd been late by a few minutes that day. Then he pulled up his attendance app on his iPad and started marking us as absent. Anyone who walks through that door after 9:00am will be marked absent and asked to leave immediately. No exceptions, no excuses. Welcome to the real world, children. We were all super angry at how this tyrant was ruling us. In fact, we were so angry that we decided to rebel against the system all at once. Chaos started the very next morning. Matt, our certified class clown, reached the classroom at 40 seconds past 9:00am. I watched from my seat as he reached for the door handle and Mister Gambino's eyes lit up with six satisfaction, ready to make an example of him. But before he could, Speak. Matt simply turned around and walked away. Mr Gambino chased after him like a raccoon. Matt, where do you think you're going? Get in here so I can make an example out of you. Matt smirked and yelled loud enough for everyone to hear. Sorry, sir, but according to your clock, I'm 40 seconds late, so I guess I'll be not bothering to come at all. Your exact words, right. He turned and walked away. Mister Gambino frozen mid sentence. Get back here immediately, Mister Gambino called out. But Matt just kept walking. The confusion on our teacher's face was priceless. And as we looked at our savior who had just left, all of us thought of the same brilliant idea. Within 24 hours, word had spread through our group chat and next day, five more students deliberately showed up exactly one minute late, each one making a show of checking the clock, shrugging and walking away, while Mister Gambino's face turned progressively redder. This is ridiculous. You can't just leave and avoid class, he shouted after Amy as she strolled away. But, sir, she called back cheerfully. We're following your rules, you said. Don't bother coming at all if we're one minute late. We're just respecting your wishes. He tried changing tactics, standing by the door to physically block students from leaving. But Tom simply said, are you telling me to disregard your official class policy? Should I report to the administration that you're giving inconsistent instructions, Mister Gambino had no choice but to step aside, watching his classroom empty out student by student. By Friday morning, the usually packed classroom had 12 empty seats. All students who coordinated to arrive precisely 90 seconds late congregating in the hallway to study together. Using bootleg recordings of his previous lectures, Mister Gambino finally broke apart when we convinced even the nerds to join in. The entire class had coordinated through Snapchat to arrive exactly two minutes late. And I, I watched from the bathroom doorway as all 28 of us stood in the hallway casually checking our phones while Mister Gambino stood alone in a completely empty classroom. His face cycled through confusion, rage and then panic as he realised the principal was doing her weekly walk through that morning. We could hear him scrambling to the door. This is completely unnecessary. You all know what I meant. I was just trying to encourage punctuality. Just come back inside. I pulled up my phone and showed the email he'd sent to parents. This is what you told us. Any student who arrives even one second after 9:00am will not be permitted entry under any circumstances. This is non negotiable. Should we forward this to the entire school to clarify your non negotiable policy? The principal's voice echoed down the hall. Mr Gambino, why are all your students in the hallway and why is your classroom empty? We listened as he panicked and started sweating buckets. They, they're being deliberately Obtuse about a simple attendance policy, the principal looked at the crowd of students with their textbooks open, clearly studying. Are you refusing to admit students to class? She I asked, because that would be a serious violation of district policy. Mister Gambino's voice cracked. No, I told them, if they're late. So you're denying education to students? She interrupted. We need to discuss this in my office now. We all looked at each other and grinned as Mister Gambino was escorted off. Next morning, he stood on his pedestal looking defeated. As I walked into class at 9:02, knowing full well that his dumb policy was gone.

But whenever I ask if he wants to hang out on the weekend, he, like, he always comes up with an excuse about why he can't. So you're dating a married guy? Basically. See, that's what my friend said she was like. Any guy that prefers dating during the week but won't see you on the weekends either has a weekend girl or is married. And you're his secret side piece. Okay, before we get too far into this, what is this guy's name? Jonathan. Okay, you said it's been about a month or so? Yes. Okay, let me ask the stupid question here. Does this guy work on the weekends? No, he's. He's an investment broker. So they don't even do business on the weekends except maybe play golf. Okay, see, an investment broker. He just sounds married. It's a married person job. I mean, I. I guarantee he's married, has kids and everything. Okay, pump your brakes here. When. When you guys go out? Heather, you said it's during the week? Yes. Does he ever seem like he's trying to be secretive when you're together? And by that, I mean, like, does he say, let's meet somewhere instead of picking you up? Does he take you places that are like 45 minute drives out of town? That kind of stuff? No, not really. We're pretty open. With our dating. So like, for instance, like on Valentine's Day, he took me to the melting pot and he kissed me in the parking lot in front of everybody. So. Okay, it doesn't mean he's not married. I mean, what if his family like, lives in another town and he just works here? I don't know. I mean, I met him on a dating website and he basically talked about how hard dating is. And he told me about his ex girlfriend. He just doesn't sound like he's married. Yeah, but at the same time, I mean, he could have just been making all of that up. We know people like that. Okay, so. So you want us to do what, Heather? Find out if he's married. That would be a great start, yeah. Okay. And I guess maybe find out why he's always busy on the weekend. I mean, maybe he just likes to have alone time on the weekends. We don't know, but we can find out. Hang on the line so we can get his number from you. Okay? Okay. Okay. How much money do you want to put on this whole married thing? How much money? Yeah, how much money you wanna bet? I don't know. I don't wanna bet money. I mean, it's. It's dirty work Wednesday. How about this? How about if. Alright, if he is, if he's married, like you think, I will take you to chick fil A. But if he's not, Married. Then you have to take me and Shaggy to Pizza Hut Buffet today for lunch. Well, get ready to buy me lunch, because this guy is married. Alright, well we're gonna find out when we come back.

My four year old daughter, Daniela, came into the kitchen crying after preschool and said, daddy, I don't want to go to school anymore. They keep punching my belly. I immediately knelt down and saw real fear in her eyes. She was holding her belly, and my wife, Ruby, rushed over. As I gently asked Daniela to explain what was happening at school, she said during nap time, someone kept hitting her stomach. Happened almost every day and made her feel sick. When I asked who was doing it, she couldn't say because the room was dark during nap time. The next morning, I met with the preschool director, Mrs. Henderson. She seemed genuinely shocked and promised to investigate immediately. They would have a teacher stationed right next to Daniela during nap time and review all their procedures. But Daniela came home that afternoon still complaining about stomach pain. We took her to see Doctor Webber, who did a thorough examination. He found no bruising or signs of physical trauma. Her abdomen felt normal, and blood work came back fine. He suggested it might be anxiety or possibly acid reflux and prescribed some mild medication. But I knew my daughter wasn't making this up. Over the next two weeks, the preschool insisted no one was touching Daniela. They moved her mat next to the teacher's desk and watched her constantly. But she kept coming home with the same story. Ruby and I were at our wits end trying to figure out what was happening to our little girl. Ruby suggested installing a baby monitor in Daniela's room. Maybe she was having night terrors or sleep disturb princess that she was confusing with school experiences. I agreed because we needed answers. We set up the camera without telling either of the kids about it. The first few nights showed nothing unusual. I started leaving the monitor on during the day, too, when the kids played upstairs. That's when I began noticing odd behavior from our seven year old son, Walker. Walker would go into Daniela's room frequently when she was playing. Sometimes he'd just stand in the doorway watching her. Other times, he'd get very close to her and she'd push him away. It seemed like normal sibling behavior, but something about his expression bothered me. Five days after installing the monitor, I was reviewing footage from the previous night. Around 2 a m, Walker had entered Daniela's room. He stood by her bed, then reached down and punched her in the stomach, hard. Daniela curled up in her sleep and whimpered, but did wake fully. Walker hit her two more times before leaving. I felt sick as I called Ruby over. We watched in shock as I showed her multiple instances of Walker hitting Daniela over the past week. Sometimes at night, sometimes during afternoon naps when we thought both kids were sleeping. Our son had been systematically hurting his sister. For weeks. Confronted Walker that morning. He denied it until we showed him the video. Then he just shrugged and said he didn't know why he did it. No remorse, no explanation. Ruby started crying while I tried to understand how we'd missed this. Walker had always been a good kid who did well in school and had friends. We immediately made an appointment with Doctor Roberts, child psychologist. She met with Walker several times that week. He was cooperative, but couldn't explain his behavior. He said sometimes he just felt like he had to hurt Daniela. The compulsion would come over him, and he couldn't stop himself. Doctor Roberts recommended keeping the siblings separated and possibly medication. She wanted to rule out any neurological issues with brain scans. We implemented strict supervision and door alarms. Walker seemed to understand he done wrong. But we caught him trying to sneak into Daniela's room twice more. During this stressful time, I was going through the monitor footage obsessively, looking for patterns. That's when I noticed something odd. In recordings from several weeks ago, pepper appeared in some of the daytime footage in Walker's room. We assumed she ran away two months ago. When she disappeared, I watched Walker playing with pepper normally at first, but then in footage from early March, I saw him picking her up roughly. In another clip, he was pulling her tail while she tried to get away. The last footage of pepper showed Walker Carrying her into his closet. She never appeared on camera again after that. My hands were shaking as I went up to Walker's room. He was at school and Ruby had taken Daniela to a playdate. I opened his closet and started moving boxes and toys. Behind his sports equipment, I found a small cardboard box sealed with tape. Smell hit me before I even opened it. Inside was Pepper's collar and what remained of her body, wrapped in a towel. She'd been dead for weeks based on the condition. I stumbled backward, feeling like I might vomit. Our seven year old son had killed our family cat and hidden her in his closet and we had no idea. I called Ruby immediately and told her to keep Daniela away from the house. Then I called Doctor Roberts. With this discovery, she said to call the police and not touch anything else. This went beyond normal childhood behavioral issues. Walker had shown calculated violence toward animals, which often escalated to humans. When Walker came home from school, I was waiting with two police officers and a social worker. He saw them and his face went completely blank. No surprise, no fear. Just empty. As they explained why they were there, he tilted his head and looked directly at me. Did you find the other box, too? My eyes went wide. Full story on channel linked below.

My mom smirked. Good to know, I said, pulled back the 6,500 dollar honeymoon fund, canceled the flights and by morning had 6, 7 missed calls plus one message that changed everything. It was a Tuesday when the text came through. Just three words, we all agreed. At first I wasn't sure what it meant, but my stomach already knew. A minute later, my phone buzzed again. Time it was a full sentence from my mom. We all agreed, you're not welcome at the wedding. No punctuation, just that smug little dash she always used when she wanted to sound formal, like a smirk in text form. I reread it three times, waiting for it to change. It didn't. My sister's wedding, the one I helped pay for, the one I planned half of because Sarah was too stressed to deal with florists and vendors, the one where I wired $1,500 for centerpieces that looked like Pinterest knees on a florist shop. I wasn't just invited. I'd been the backbone, or so I thought. I didn't respond. Instead, I opened my laptop and logged into the travel portal. Two business class honeymoon tickets under my email, cancel, $3,800 refund, and I wired $6,500 the Honeymoon Overflow fund I'd sent to mom back into my savings. I felt nothing, no anger, no sadness, just calm, like I'd finally exhaled after years of holding my breath. By eight seventeen PM, Sarah was calling, then mom. Then cousins turn my phone face down. By morning, 23 missed calls, one voicemail from dad. You need to see this now. Dad doesn't meddle. He's quiet, deliberate. If he stepped in, it mattered. I called. He picked up on the second ring. Kyle, he said softly, I told everyone you chose not to come. I blinked. What they said you backed out, that you were bitter. Your mom even told Sarah's in laws you threatened to ruin the wedding if you showed up. My laugh was sharp, humorless. So they exile me and then make it my decision? It's worse, dad said. They told people you refused to fund the honeymoon out of spite. I went. Still, I already did fund it. They don't care, he said quietly. Something cracked in me, not rage, not grief, clarity. That night, dad forwarded me screenshots. Mom, Sarah and Aunt. It's in a group chat. Don't worry about Kyle. He's just bitter. No one's ever loved him enough to marry him. He's a ghost. Let him fade. No seat, no speech, no drama. I deleted the screenshots. I didn't need to read them twice. I already knew I wasn't family. I was furniture. So I started dismantling the house. I've been holding up Mom's phone plan, suspended Sarah's Venmo, unlinked from my bank. Auto payments on her student loan, canceled every streaming account. Profiles deleted and the venue deposit still under my name. I canceled it. By Thursday, the polite email came. Through your reservation has been terminated, deposit forfeited unless a new booking is secured. Let them explain that to 118 guests. Friday morning, I got an email from Linda, the groom's mom, formal direct.

I waited until dad left for his shift at the hardware store the next morning, then hooked up our ancient VCR with shaking hands. The footage was grainy, the sound scratchy, but there he was, my father at 20, sitting nervously at a beat up piano and what looked like a community center. And he was terrible. I mean, genuinely, painfully bad. The piece was Fur Elise, something I'd mastered in eighth grade. His technique was sloppy. His timing was all over the place and he kept stumbling over the simplest passages. The judge's faces said everything, polite smiles barely masking secondhand embarrassment. One guy was literally checking his watch. When dad came home that evening and launched into his usual I sacrificed my dreams for this family speech over reheated pizza, something inside me finally snapped. I calmly walked to the TV, inserted the tape and pressed play. Without saying a word, the color drained from his face as his younger self butchered Beethoven on screen. Mom's mouth fell open. Turn it off, he whispered, but I didn't move. When the painful three minute audition finally ended with scattered enthusiastic applause, I looked him straight in the eyes. You didn't sacrifice your music career for us, dad. You never had one to sacrifice. Music gave up on you 20 years ago and now you can't stay. And that I actually have The talent you always pretended to have. His face crumpled like wet cardboard. Twenty years of lies collapsed in those few seconds. Mom just stared at both of us speak, speechless. You have no idea what rejection feels like, he finally whispered. Actually, I do, I replied. You've been rejecting me my whole life. Two weeks later, I moved out with the money I'd saved for my part time job at the music store. I'm starting at Juilliard in the fall. Sometimes the people who claim to protect you from failure.

So I was married to Ben for 18 years before I finally got tired of his crap and filed for divorce. This guy was the worst kind of husband, the type who thinks screaming at you about burnt toast means he's communicating. He tear me down every single day with his mouth, calling me useless, stupid, you name it. The final straw was when he told me I was lucky he married me because nobody else would want damaged goods like me. After the divorce papers were signed, Ben packed his stuff and moved 4 hours away to live near his mom. Perfect. Good riddance. Here's the thing. He also decided our three kids weren't worth the drive anymore. Child support barely covered, groceries, visits, maybe Christmas if we were lucky. I was basically a single mom overnight while this deadbeat played video games in his childhood bedroom. About six months later, I decided we needed new family photos. The old ones still had Ben's smug face in them. Every time I walked past our hallway, I wanted to punch the wall. I booked us a session at one of those fancy portrait studios downtown. My kids were excited. They'd grown so much since the divorce. And honestly, we all looked happier without Ben's negativity dragging us down. We spent the afternoon taking different poses. The photographer was this sweet older lady who kept making my youngest laugh by making funny faces. Behind the camera when we finished, she showed us the digital gallery on her computer. The photos were beautiful, genuine smiles, relaxed poses, none of that forced family nonsense we used to do. As we're scrolling through picking which ones to order, my oldest daughter, Emma, suddenly perks up. Mom, can we send one to Grandma Ruth? That's Ben's mom. I felt my stomach drop a little because Ruth and I never really had much of a relationship. We saw each other maybe twice a year at holidays, exchanged pleasantries. That was it. Honey, I don't think grandma would want a picture with me in it, I told her gently. But we can definitely order her a nice one with just you kids. Emma shook her head really fast. Oh, mom, she always asks about you when dad calls. She tells him he messed up. The best thing that ever happened to him. Wait, what? I was shocked. Ben's best friend, Trevor, had mentioned something similar a few weeks back when he stopped by to grab some tools. Ben forgot, he said. Ruth was constantly getting on Ben's case about the divorce, telling him he was an idiot for throwing away his family. She even kept me as a friend on Facebook while Ben blocked me everywhere. Emma grabbed my phone.

The words hit me like a freight train. Mia was 16, and I told her we adopted her as a Newborn. But document in her hands showed she was born three years before the date I'd always celebrated as her gotcha day. My mouth went dry as I stared at the official paperwork. Mia had found it while looking for her passport in my desk drawer for a school trip. The birth certificate clearly showed her birth date as March 15th, 2005. But I've been telling her she was adopted in 2005. The math didn't add up, and my teenage daughter was smart enough to notice. I sat down heavily on the couch, trying to figure out how to explain something I'd hoped she'd never have to know. Sweetheart, there are some parts of your adoption story that are more complicated than I told you when you were little. But Mia wasn't buying vague explanations anymore. She sat across from me with the determination of a teenager who'd caught her parent in a lie. Mom, this says I was three years old when you adopted me. That means I have memories from before. Why don't I remember anything? And why have you been lying about this my entire life? The truth was devastating, and I'd spent 16 years hoping I'd never have to tell her. Mia had been removed. From her birth family. Due to severe neglect and trauma, she'd spent those first three years in conditions so horrible that her mind had blocked out most of the memories to protect check itself. I explained that when she came to us, she was malnourished, barely speaking, and had been living in a house with no electricity or running water. Her birth parents had been addicted to drugs and had left her alone for days at a time. Child services had finally intervened when neighbors reported a toddler crying alone in an empty house. The reason I'd lied about her being adopted as a Newborn was to protect her from the knowledge that she'd suffered trauma so early in life. The social worker had recommended we create a simpler story to help her build a secure attachment without the burden of knowing about her traumatic beginning. Mia stared at me with tears in her eyes. I had a whole life before you, and you just erased it. What if I have siblings out there? What if my birth parents got clean and have been looking for me? The questions I dreaded for 16 years were pouring out of her. I showed her the thick file I'd kept locked away, containing all the documentation from her case. Her birth parents had both died from overdoses within two years of losing custody. There were no siblings, no extended family who'd been able to take her. We hadn't erased her past.

At first it seemed like the perfect distraction. Garage sales every weekend, state auctions, picking up random radios and TVs from the 70s and 80s for dirt cheap. He disappear into our parents basement for 12 hour stretches, tinkering with circuit boards and vacuum tubes surrounded by coffee cups and takeout containers. Mom thought it was therapeutic. After his divorce, dad called it a healthy hobby that kept his mind sharp. At least he's not drinking himself to death, mom would say, when we heard the power tools running at midnight. But around month 6, Marcus started getting weird about it, wouldn't let anyone downstairs, not even to grab Christmas decorations, installed three different deadbolt locks on the basement door. When I asked what he was building, he'd get this intense look and say he was working on something that would change everything. The electric bills became insane. We're talking $800 monthly spikes from a house that used to run $200. When dad finally confronted him, Marcus claimed his equipment needed 24 7 precise calibration and couldn't be powered down without ruining months of work. Then our neighbors started complaining. The Johnson's Wi-Fi kept cutting out during important zoom calls. Missus Chen's cell phone would drop calls mid conversation. Her garage door started opening randomly at 3:00am, setting off her car alarm. Marcus got more paranoid and secretive, started driving two towns over to buy Equipment with cash only, thick technical manuals from military surplus stores arrived weekly, hidden inside Amazon boxes. I catch him whispering into burner phones at odd hours using terms like frequency sweeps, signal interference and transmission range testing. He stopped coming to family dinners, stopped showering regularly, lost about 30 pounds because he'd forget to eat. When mom tried to bring him sandwiches, he'd barely crack the door open like he was hiding something massive behind it. The final straw was when the fire department couldn't reach a house fire six blocks away because their radios went dead for 20 minutes. A family nearly died because the dispatcher couldn't coordinate the response trucks. Last Tuesday, I decided I couldn't wait anymore, picked all three basement locks with YouTube tutorials while Marcus was at his weekly cash only electronics run. What I found still gives me nightmares. The entire basement had been converted into some kind of military grade communication center. Massive antennas snaked through holes he drilled in the foundation. Dozens of monitors showed radio frequencies, signal strengths, emergency channel traffic. Equipment I didn't recognize hummed and clicked with rows of blinking lights. But the terrifying part was the wall covered in detailed local maps. Red pins marked every hospital, police station, fire department and school within a 50 mile radius. Handwritten notes documented response times, radio frequencies shift.

I stayed until 3:00am redoing slide 12. You said it didn't convey confidence. He opened the folder. Inside were thank you notes, everyone I'd written him over the years. Coffee sleeves with orders scribbled on them, postits in my handwriting. That's when I knew, knew what? That I was obsessive about presentations, that I was completely gone for you. He pulled out a coffee sleeve. This is from last week. Extra shot oat milk, 1 pump vanilla. How do you know my stressed order? Because I've been paying attention for 4 years.

Three years ago, Cassie and her son Kenny moved in next door with just a few boxes. I offered to help, noticed Kenny had a PS four, and told him he could come play my PS five anytime. Being a mechanic, I also told Cassie I could help with any car trouble. We barely spoke for weeks till Cassie knocked asking about her dead engine. Just needed new spark plugs. She insisted on cooking dinner as thanks, and I reluctantly accepted. That dinner changed everything. Kenny turned out to be this brilliant kid, obsessed with games, science, and guitar. We bonded over Mario Kart, and he started coming over regularly. I became his gaming mentor, teaching him strategies, celebrating his victories, watching him grow more confident with each win. During lockdown, I caught COVID bad. Cassie appeared at my door with soup, cleaned my apartment while I was passed out, brought groceries, checked my temperature at 2 a m. She basically saved me. After that, dinners became our nightly tradition. Mission. Six months ago, Kenny introduced his friend. This is Richard. He's like my dad. I froze. The friend didn't react, but I felt the weight of those words. Later, I asked Cassie about it while Kenny was at practice. It's been hoping we'd become a real family, she said quietly, then added, I wouldn't mind that, either. My heart stopped. Are you asking me out? I'm Saying, I'm open to it if you are. We planned a date for Saturday. I was terrified of ruining what we had. She answered the door in this blue dress that made me forget how to speak. Initial awkwardness melted when she took my hand. Walking to the restaurant. Over dinner, she confessed what changed her mind. Remember last Christmas? Kenny wanted that PS five so badly, but I couldn't afford it. You bought it and let me give it to him. Watching his face, knowing what you did. That's when I knew that was nothing. It wasn't nothing. You gave my son joy and me dignity. That's everything. Back at her apartment, we set boundaries. Keep bit quiet until we knew it was real. Don't give Kenny false hope. Take things slow. The dad comment, she said, maybe I should have corrected him. Maybe not, I replied. We spent Sunday apple picking, holding hands like teenagers. Monday dinner, Kenny chatted about school while Cassie's foot found mine under the table. Everything felt natural, like pieces clicking into place. Two weeks later, I'm at work when my boss calls me to his office. There's a huge bouquet on his desk. This is for you, he says, grinning. The card reads, just because. Love your GF. The shop guys destroyed me for it. Richard's got flowers. Someone's whipped. But I didn't care. I was floating. Three months now, Kenny doesn't know we're dating, but he knows something's different. Last week, he Asked if I could teach him to drive when he's old enough. Ask your mom, I said. But you're better at cars. Still need her permission? He paused. What if she was your girlfriend? Could you just decide then? Kids know everything.

So three years ago, I was fresh out of college, 21, and stupid enough to think dating a lawyer was gonna be this whole glamorous thing. This guy, Trevor, was 27, worked at some decent firm downtown and honestly seemed pretty smart when he talked about cases and legal stuff. I actually trusted what he said about the law because, you know, he was literally a lawyer. After I wrapped up this internship programme, I told him about my real plan. I wanted to work as a paralegal for a while, get some experience in the field and then eventually apply to law school. Once I figured out what I was doing, I thought he'd be supportive or at least give me some advice. Instead, this guy literally scoffed at me, like made this gross little snorting noise and everything. Then he goes, you'd probably be better off as a court clerk. And before you think maybe he meant it in a nice way, let me tell you the way he said it made it super clear. He was basically calling me an idiot. Court clerks do important work, but he said it like I was too dumb for anything else. I just sat there completely shocked. I mean, we've been together for three months and I thought he actually respected me, but nope, apparently he thought I was some airhead who couldn't handle real legal work. I was so hurt I Didn't even know what to say back at 21. I hadn't Learned how to stand up for myself yet, so I just pretended it didn't bother me. A couple weeks later, I got my first paralegal job at this family law firm. The work was actually really interesting and I was good at it. Trevor and I broke up pretty soon after that because, surprise, surprise, he turned out to be a total jerk in other ways too. But here's where it gets good. His stupid comment never left my head. Every time I had a bad day at work or felt overwhelmed, I'd remember him laughing at me. So I decided to prove him wrong in the biggest way possible. I started studying for the L s. A t. During my lunch breaks and weekends. I bought every prep book they had at Barnes and noble, took practice tests until my eyes hurt and even paid for one of those expensive online courses with money I definitely didn't have. My co workers probably thought I was obsessed. I kept thinking about Trevor's face when he dismissed me. The test was brutal. I'm talking four hours of pure mental torture. But when my scores came back, I literally screamed in my apartment. 98 percentile. I scored better than 98% of everyone who took that test. Then came law school. Apply.

I figured she was just on her period or something, tbh. But when our 12 year old son came home, my wife Talia appeared with a 700 dollar Bill by Bill. When she thought I wasn't looking, not enough, she said quietly, then louder. Looking at Adonis, you know what happens if it's not enough? I bit my tongue until the next morning, Talia was giving Adonis two white pills with breakfast. What are those vitamins? She dead but watched him swallow them like her life depended on it. They'll help you last longer. That's when his teacher, Missus Swan called me from work. Mr Williams, I need to talk to you about Adonis. He's fallen asleep in class three times this week. I'll talk to him tonight. Mr Williams, she pause. Is everything okay at home? Her question swam around my head like a shark. That evening I tried bringing it up with Talia while she was folding laundry. Missus Swan called about Adonis sleeping in class. She didn't even look up. Kids need more sleep. Maybe we should get him to bed earlier. Talia. He went to bed at seven thirty PM last night. She finally turned around and For just a second, I saw fear in her eyes, like she was drowning and I was about to find out why. Just leave it alone, Noah, please. That night, I couldn't sleep. Something was nagging at me, so I went to check our family computer. The Facebook, the marketplace was still open. As I scrolled through the sold listings, my heart dropped. Adonis's PlayStation, his bike, the signed baseball from his 10th birthday that he treasured. The next morning at breakfast, I watched Adonis try to eat. His split lip made him wince with every bite. Purple bruises crept up from under his collar. Adonis, who did this to you? Nobody did anything to me. But his hands were shaking so bad he dropped his orange juice. Talia grabbed him by the shoulders. You promised me three more months. Three more months, she was crying. Now I can't lose both of you. I asked if she was okay and she mumbled something about hormones and menopause. I was in the pickup line that afternoon when Principal Harris approached my car. She leaned into my window before I could even ask about Adonis. He's fine, she said quickly. Don't ask questions. Just be grateful. Mrs. Harris, what? Your wife said, if we interfere, she'll pull him from school entirely. At least here we can watch him. She was already walking away. When I got home, I cornered Talia in our bedroom. Something's wrong with Adonis. Really wrong. Drop it, Talia. I said, drop it. In 15 years of marriage, she never screamed at me like that. Then I heard movement from the bathroom. Adonis was hunched over the toilet. The water was pink. He was vomiting blood and trying to flush it away before I could see. It's nothing. Dad just ate something bad. That's blood. You're throwing up blood. It's fine. It's not fine. I grabbed Talia in the hallway. We're taking him to the hospital right now. They'll ask too many questions. They'll take him away from us. Her phone rang. She answered it with shaking hands. Then her face went white. If he dies, it's on you, she hissed into the phone. You promised me this would save him. You promised me. It was the only way. Talia hung up and turned to find Adonis in the doorway. Mom, it hurts so much when they use me. Everything hurts. His voice broke on the last word. She pulled him against her, running her fingers through his hair. I know, baby. I'm so proud of you. She was crying into his hair. Just one more.

So I refused to back down and asked my grandpa to walk me down the aisle instead. My father has always blamed me for my mother's death during childbirth, while my older sister, Mary, became his golden child who could do no wrong. I spent my childhood doing every household chore, being constantly ignored and carrying guilt for something completely beyond my control. The breaking point came during a Thanksgiving visit when my sister met my then boyfriend of two years. Mary flirted shamelessly with him all night, constantly touching his arm, leaning into his personal space, calling him gorgeous while putting me down by saying she never thought her ugly duckling sister would land someone like him. When I pulled her aside and asked her to stop, she laughed in my face and called me pathetically jealous. That night, I went to bed early, emotionally and physically exhausted by the blatant disrespect in my own family's home. My boyfriend said he'd come up soon but never did. Next morning, I found him in Mary's bed, both half naked with two empty wine bottles and glasses scattered on the floor. Mary's reaction when I caught them? Zero apology. She had the audacity to tell me to get out of her room so she can get dressed, like I was invading her privacy. Then she spent weeks bragging to our Cousins about stealing my man in one night and claimed he told her she was way better in bed than me. Dad's response when I told him what happened, they're both adults. You should have been more careful about the kind of man you brought around Mary. He obviously has loose character. That's on you for not seeing it. He actually blamed me for bringing a cheater around his precious daughter as if Mary was some innocent victim instead of an active participant who pursued my boyfriend all night. I cut contact with both of them immediately. For 3 years, I refused all communication. Then dad had a major heart attack. Despite everything I stepped up to help him recover. I paid medical bills his insurance wouldn't cover, hired a caretaker and made sure he had everything. During his two month recovery, Mary visited twice and contributed nothing financially. Her excuse was her part time retail job didn't pay enough. During recovery, Dad's eyes finally opened. He saw who actually cared versus who expected to be taken care of. For the first time, he apologized and acknowledged how wrong he'd been to excuse Mary's betrayal. We started rebuilding our relationship. Slowly. Phone calls became regular. He seemed genuinely remorseful and wanted to make amends. So when I got engaged to Jesse, a kind, loyal man who treats me like I deserve, I decided dad had earned the.

The problem, our family car was a 1998 Honda Civic with 250,000 miles, a broken air conditioner and a passenger door that only opened from the outside. My dad, being the eternal optimist, said this car has character. It'll make the trip more memorable. He was right about the memorable part. Day one started great. We packed snacks, downloaded podcasts and my little sister made a road trip playlist. But thirty minutes into our eight hour drive, the car started making this weird grinding noise that sounded like a blender full of rocks. That's just the engine warming up, dad said, confidently, turning up the radio to drown out the noise. By hour two, we were all sweating because the AC was broken and it was 95 degrees outside. My mom kept fanning herself with a gas station map while muttering, we should have flown. My sister and I were crammed in the back seat with all our luggage because dad had maximized trunk space efficiency. I was sitting on a cooler. She was wedged between suitcases and we were both slowly melting. Then the car started overheating. Steam was pouring from under the hood and dad pulled over at this sketch, the gas station in the middle of nowhere. The attendant took one look at our car and said, y'all are brave driving that thing cross country while dad was under the Hood pretending he knew what he was doing. My sister decided to get out through the broken passenger door. She pushed from the inside while I pulled from the outside and the door came completely off its hinges. We just stood there holding a car door in a gas station parking lot while other travelers stared at us like we were a traveling circus. Well, dad said, wiping grease off his hands, now we have better ventilation. Mom was not amused. We duct taped the door back on and continue driving with all the windows down because the car was still overheating. My hair was whipping around like I was in a tornado and my sister looked like she'd been electrocuted. Our four brought new problems. The radio died, so dad started singing old country songs at the top, top of his lungs. Then the speedometer stopped working, so we had to guess how fast we were going by feeling the road. I think we're doing about 55, he'd announced while semis were passing us like we were standing still by our six. We were all delirious from the heat and dad singing. My sister had given up on life and was just.

My 14 year old son, Adam has this best friend Dean, who's literally the only reason he still smiles some days. They met last year when we switched schools after my divorce. And Dean was the kid who sat with Adam at lunch when nobody else would. You know how brutal middle school can be for the quiet kids. Dean's dad, Mike, picks him up every day since he's a single dad too. We'd see each other in the pickup line and eventually started talking just normal parent stuff, how the kids were doing in math, upcoming school events, that kind of thing. My husband Jake started getting weird about it almost immediately. Jake would make these passive aggressive comments whenever Mike's name came up. Like if I mentioned that Mike told me about some school fundraiser, Jake would roll his eyes and mutter something about how Mike sure knows a lot about what's going on. It was annoying, but I figured he'd get over it. Then Adam got really sick and needed surgery to remove his appendix. It was scary because they found complications and he had to stay in the hospital for almost 2 weeks. Dean visited every single day after school. Sometimes Mike would drive him over on weekends too, since they live pretty far from the hospital. Jake would either completely ignore Mike when he showed up or make these Weird territorial comments like when Mike brought Adam some comic books. Jake loudly announced that we already had plenty of books at home. When Mike offered to help with anything we needed, Jake said we were fine and had everything handled. It was embarrassing. Mike definitely noticed because he started keeping his visit shorter. I told Jake to knock it off because his attitude was affecting both boys. Adam could see the tension and Dean started looking uncomfortable whenever Jake was around. Adam finally came home from the hospital about three weeks ago. Everything seemed fine for a few days. The boys were texting constantly and making plans for when Adam felt strong enough to hang out again. Dean even brought over his Nintendo Switch so they could play together while Adam was still recovering. Then last Tuesday, I found Adam crying in his room, not just upset crying, but full on sobbing into his pillow. When I asked what was wrong, he showed me his phone. Dean had sent him a text saying they couldn't be friends anymore and then blocked his number on everything. Adam was devastated and kept asking what he did wrong. I was confused because they'd been fine the day before. Dean had texted Adam about some video they wanted to watch together. I decided to talk to Mike the next day at pickup. But when I went to get in my car that morning, I saw Dean's phone sitting in Jake's cup holder. I Confronted Jake immediately. First, he said Dean must have forgotten it when they visited, but Dean hadn't been over in days. After I kept pushing, Jake finally admitted he took Dean's phone from his backpack when they were at the hospital last week. He used it to send that text to Adam pretending to be Dean. I completely lost it. I started yelling at him right there in the driveway, asking what the hell was wrong with him. He said Mike was getting too close to me and acting inappropriate.

As the only daughter with eight brothers, I had to cook every meal for 10 people because my mother said cooking was how daughters showed love. My parents had eight boys before they finally got me, so you'd think they'd be excited about finally having a girl. But the day I turned 7, mom handed me an apron and said my real education was starting. While my brothers played video games and threw footballs around, I was standing on a stool stirring boiling pots. My mom would hover behind me listing all the ways I was already while my skin blistered from grease splatters and my back ached from reaching counters too high for a seven year old. By 10, my alarm went off at 4:00am every day because breakfast for 11 people took three hours minimum. When everyone wanted something different. Parker needed eggs over easy but not runny. Josh demanded fresh pancakes, not reheated ones. Ryan wanted bacon crispy. Ben required oatmeal. Isaac only ate French toast cut in triangles. Miles needed everything on separate plates because food couldn't touch. Dylan changed his mind constantly and baby Micah screamed if his bottles weren't the perfect temperature. My feet would go numb from standing on cold kitchen tiles and my arms shook from lifting heavy pans. But sitting down meant starting over because laziness ruined food. According to mom, the cooking never stopped because after breakfast came packing. Nine different lunches with nine different preferences, then preparing snacks for whoever was home, then making lunch for the brothers who'd forgotten their packed ones, then more snacks, then starting the four hour dinner prep, then dessert, then evening snacks, then midnight sandwiches when teenage brothers got hungry. My fingers were permanently stained yellow from peeling endless potatoes and covered in cuts and I'd fallen asleep standing up so many times that I Learned to prop myself against the counter while stirring. By 13, I was missing school constantly because dinner prep started at two PM my grades tanked but nobody cared because what did I need education for? And my whole life would be standing in front of a stove until I died. My growth was stunted from malnutrition because I only got to eat leftovers if there were any. I'd sneak raw vegetables while shopping and consider it dinner while my spine curved from hunching over cutting boards for 16 hours a day. The physical damage accumulated fast because burns that never healed properly turned to scars covering my arms and my hands look like a 40 year old olds from the constant hot water and harsh soaps. I developed chronic back pain that made standing agony and sleeping impossible. When I fainted from exhaustion and dehydration, cracking my head on the counter, mom made me finish dinner with blood dripping into the soup because they needed their meals on time. My brother saw me as kitchen machinery That existed solely to produce food. And they bang on the kitchen door like animals when meals were five minutes late. Josh once grabbed my burnt hand and squeezed until I screamed because his steak was overcooked. And Ryan threw a plate at my head when I forgot his extra, leaving a scar above my eyebrow. They'd eat directly from pots while I was still cooking, burning my arms with their reaching. And not one of them ever said thank you or offered to help or even acknowledged I was human. At 17, I discovered I developed arthritis in my hands from the constant chopping and stirring. And the doctor said I need surgery eventually. But my parents.

So I made sure that she would be crowned the prom joke. Bridget and I were both seniors at different schools with proms on the same night. She'd been planning her entrance for months. A custom $3,000 silver gown her mom had imported from Paris. She showed it to everyone multiple times at every family gathering. I bought mine from a consignment shop for $200. It was vintage emerald silk, probably from the 90s, with delicate beadwork. Nothing fancy, but it fit perfectly and made me feel beautiful. That was the problem. Three days before prom, Bridget came over while I was at work. Mom let her in to borrow my calculus notes. When I got home, my dress was laid out on my bed with bright pink nail polish splattered across the bodice, still wet, deliberately poured in long streaks. Bridget's text came an hour later. Oops, was doing my nails on your bed and knocked over the bottle. At least now people will definitely notice my dress more. You understand, right? Can't have two pretty dresses at family photos. She detached a winky face. I took photos. Many photos. Different angles, close UPS of the polish pattern. Then I did something strange. I went to Bridget's house when I knew she was at her spray tan appointment. Her mom let me in. Oh, Lila. Here to see the dress again? The infamous silver gown hung In Bridget's room. Like a trophy. I took photos of it too. The label, the receipt her mom had framed. Yes, framed. The matching shoes, everything. Then I went home and got creative with Photoshop. Bridget had been posting prom prep content for weeks. Nail appointments, hair trials, countless mirror selfies. She had maybe 2,000 followers, mostly kids from various schools who knew her from swim team. I made an anonymous account and posted one simple thing. A side by side on the left, Bridget's actual dress. On the right, a screenshot from a Chinese wholesale website selling the exact same Paris custom gown for seventy nine dollars and ninety nine cents, free shipping included. It wasn't hard to find. The custom designer had just been dropshipping from overseas and marking up 3,000%. But I didn't stop there. I messaged the comparison to Ashley, the biggest gossip at Bridget's school. Thought you should know since she's been calling everyone else's dress cheap. Ashley screenshotted it, sent it to her group chat. Within two hours half of Bridget senior class had seen it. Someone found the wholesale site had reviews. Horrible reviews. Fabric smells like chemicals. Sequence fell off immediately. Nothing like the photo. Bridget didn't know any of this yet. She was too busy posting getting ready videos, talking about her investment piece, and how quality matters more than trends. Prom night arrived. I wore my ruined dress. Yes, really. I'd cut out the damaged bodice and replaced it with A black corset top I already owned. It looked intentional. Edgy even. Like a two piece formal. My date said I looked like I'd stepped out of a fashion mag.

When I walked into my 89 year old abuela's apartment last Tuesday, my stomach couldn't handle what I saw. My grandmother was sitting at her kitchen table eating cat food straight from the can with a plastic spoon. She looked up at me with empty eyes, her beautiful silver curls now matted and unbrushed. Mija, you want some? It's too, she said in her thick Spanish accent. I immediately took it from her and told her it wasn't. I checked her fridge to get something else for her. Completely empty, except for three more cans of cat food. Her medication bottles were lined up on the counter, all of them still sealed from last month. My abuela takes pills for her heart and diabetes. Missing them for a month meant she needed to be hospitalized. Her home health aide, Leslie, was supposed to be there. According to the schedule on the wall, she should have been there right now. Four hours a day. Five. Five days a week. That's what her Medicare was paying for. I called the agency. Oh, Leslie just left. The receptionist said she's been there all morning, which was a lie, because I've been there for an hour already. Abuela was wearing the same flower dress I'd seen her in last week, except now it had stains all over the front. Her feet were wrapped in plastic bags held on with rubber bands. Where your shoes, abuela? I Asked Leslie said they were too old. She took them to buy me new ones, she replied. I went to the bathroom to get tissues and nearly gagged. The toilet was clogged and hadn't been flushed in days. The bathtub had a brown ring around it. No toilet paper anywhere. My grandmother, who used to smell like vanilla and clean laundry, hadn't bathed in weeks. The next day I came back early and waited outside in my car. Leslie showed up at 10:00am, stayed for exactly 12 minutes, then left. I followed her to her car and watch to throw my grandmother's mail in the trash, keeping what looks like a credit card statement. She was on Facetime the whole time, laughing about some party. Yeah, the old lady thinks I'm her granddaughter now. It's so easy, she said. I recorded everything on my phone. I went back inside and started going through Abuela's papers. Her bank statements showed ATM withdrawals of $500 every few days. My grandmother doesn't even know what an ATM is. Signature on the withdrawal slips didn't match hers at all. I found receipts in Leslie's name for Louis Vuitton bags, Lululemon clothes, and Coachella VIP passes worth two thousand dollars, all charged to my grandmother's emergency credit card. Then I found the worst part. Leslie had been making my grandmother sign blank papers for insurance. She told her Leslie had put herself as the sole beneficiary of my grandmother's fifty thousand dollar policy. I called Adult Protective Services immediately. They said they'd investigate within 72 hours. I didn't have 72 hours. My grandmother was 80 pounds and eating cat food. I called the agency again and asked to speak to a supervisor. Leslie is one of our best employees. The supervisor said your grand

Across the table, papers spread out between us. The will, the numbers, Grandpa's signature. The air smelled of burnt coffee, the overhead light buzzing. You're joking, I said, though I knew he wasn't. He leaned back, arms crossed. Your grandfather didn't understand the situation. If he'd known, he'd have wanted Amy taken care of. You're fine on your own. She's struggling. That's what family does. Mom nodded, eyes wet but not soft. Still be successful without it. Don't be selfish. Selfish? That word lodged in my chest like a nail. It wasn't the first time. It was never the first time. I've been the invisible child, the reliable one, the afterthought.

He slammed his fist. On the table. Amy flinched from the couch but didn't speak. Don't you dare accuse me after all we've done for you! Braces, a roof, food! You spit in our faces over money! I almost laughed. Braces, school supplies, the bare minimum twisted into some great debt. My voice cracked, but I held it. You bought Amy a car. You still pay her bills, and now you want my inheritance. Do! Amy shifted uncomfortably, eyes down. When I caught her glance, she whispered, mom and dad know best. My stomach dropped. She wasn't going to save me. So I went to the one person who might. Grandma. She listened, face pale, hands trembling around her teacup. Then she slammed it down so hard

I was playing truth or dare with my girlfriend, Cora, and now I think I have to call the cops on her. The game started innocent enough with people choosing dares like chugging hot sauce or texting embarrassing things to their parents. As the night went on and more drinks were consumed, the questions got more personal. Sarah asked her boyfriend about his worst breakup. Jacob admitted he cheated on his boyfriend with a professor college. Everyone was getting loose and sharing secrets they'd normally keep hidden. Cora kept giggling and leaning against me, seeming totally relaxed. Then it was Ralph's turn to ask Cora a truth question. He got this mischievous look and asked what the freakiest thing she'd ever done in bed was. Everyone laughed and expected her to say something tame or refuse to answer. But Cora took another sip of her drink and got this proud smile on her face. I took off his rubber without him noticing, she said, pointing at me. The room went quiet for a second. I felt my face get hot as I processed what she just said that had never happened, at least not that I was aware of. We'd always been careful about Protection since neither of us wanted kids yet. I turned to look at her, confused and uncomfortable. What do you mean, I asked, trying to keep my voice light even though my face Was turning. Cora laughed like it was the funniest thing in the world. She was clearly drunk, but not wasted enough to not know what she was saying. The other couples were exchanging awkward glances while Brandon turned the music up a little louder. Everyone could feel the sudden tension in the room. Oh, come on, don't look so serious, Cora said, waving her hand dismissively. It's not a big deal. But it was a big deal. If he'd really done that without telling me, it was a massive violation of trust. We'd specifically talked about being safe and responsible. She knew I wasn't ready to be a father. The fact that she was treating it like a funny party story made me feel sick. Sarah tried to change the subject by asking someone else truth or dare, but I couldn't let it go. I asked Cora when this had supposedly happened. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic. The other couples were getting more uncomfortable by the second. Jacob suggested we take a break from the.

Origin story. For six months, I planned every detail of my sister's dream wedding. No wedding planner, just me handling everything. Two weeks before the wedding, she refused to invite my fiance of 12 years. People will ask about your wedding instead of focusing on mine. Meanwhile, my brother's girlfriends of two years got invitations. I stopped all wedding work until she apologized and invited him. She did, barely. The ceremony was beautiful. Then at the reception, I found our seats. The kids table by the kitchen, furthest from family. Everyone else was at the VIP table. There's a mistake with the seating, I told her. She looked me dead in the eye. That's where you belong. Her groom overheard and started to object, but she silenced him with one look. He apologized to my parents later, but not to me. She told me not to. My parents were furious. When they found me, my brothers, they walked over to scold me for not giving a speech. You're only a bride once. Stop being selfish. We left and got McDonald's. I posted a photo post wedding meal. My siblings called this an attack on her somehow. Later, my sister explained her seating logic. I didn't plan her wedding perfectly. I look too pretty in my gown and I needed punishment for bringing my fiance. Three months later, I'm planning my destination. Wedding, small ceremony, parents and close friends, only my siblings. Are furious about not being invited. You're being childish, they say. I'm being selective with my money, I reply. Then my sister announces she's pregnant, due in June, our wedding month. Change your date and make me m 0 h, he demands. No. The harassment started immediately. All four siblings calling, texting, leaving voicemails about family obligation. I blocked them all. We had our dream wedding, tiny church ceremony, beach Celebration, five days island hopping in the Philippines with 20 people who actually love us. My siblings called throughout, labeling me a bridezilla for excluding them. My parents understood after what she did, we won't force you to include them. Those five days were perfect. No drama, no criticism, just Celebration with our chosen family. My husband and I paid for everything exactly as we wanted. My parents insisted on hosting a reception when we returned. We'll pay, we'll invite whoever we want, including your siblings. I agreed with one condition. I handled the seating chart. The reception was yesterday. One long table. My husband and I center with our parents, my siblings far end by the restrooms and kitchen. My sister arrived in designer maternity wear, immediately complaining about her seat. This is by the bathroom. There's no mistake, I said, smiling. That's where you belong. Her husband started to speak, but she silenced him. The same look from her wedding. You're seriously this petty, she hissed. You taught me that family sits where they deserve. My brothers tried. Moving closer, but the venue staff, thoroughly briefed, redirected them, assigned seating. Only halfway through lunch, my sister stood to make a toast. Microphone conveniently died. Technical difficulties. She tried shouting over conversations, but gave up. My brother texted, this is childish. I replied, being a bride is stress.

When I walked into my 89 year old Abuela's apartment last Tuesday, my stomach couldn't handle what I saw. My grandmother was sitting at her kitchen table eating cat food straight from the can with a plastic spoon. She looked up at me with empty eyes. Her beautiful silver curls now matted and unbrushed. Mija, you want some? It's too, she said in her thick Spanish accent. I immediately took it from her and told her it wasn't. I checked her fridge to get something else for her, completely empty except for three more cans of cat food. Her medication bottles were lined up on the counter, all of them still sealed from last month. My abuela takes pills for her heart and diabetes. Missing them for a month meant she needed to be hospitalized. Her home health aide, Leslie was supposed to be there. According to the schedule on the wall. She should have been there right now four hours a day, five days a week. That's what her Medicare was paying for. I called the agency. Oh, Leslie just left. The receptionist said she's been there all morning, which was a lie because I've been there for an hour already. Abuela was wearing the same flower dress I'd seen her in last week, except now it had stains all over the front. Her feet were wrapped in plastic bags held on with rubber bands. Where are your shoes, abuela? I Asked, Leslie said they were too old. She took them to buy me new ones, she replied. I went to the bathroom to get tissues and nearly gagged. The toilet was clogged and hadn't been flushed in days. The bathtub had a brown ring around it. No toilet paper anywhere. My grandmother, who used to smell like vanilla and clean laundry, hadn't bathed in weeks. The next day, I came back early and waited outside in my car. Leslie showed up at 10:00am, stayed for exactly 12 minutes, then left. I followed her to her car and watched her throw my grandmother's mail in the trash, keeping what looks like a credit card statement. She was on Facetime the whole time, laughing about some party. Yeah, the old lady thinks I'm her granddaughter now. It's so easy, she said. I recorded everything on my phone. I went back inside and started going through Abuela's papers. Her bank statement showed ATM withdrawals of $500 every few days. My grandmother doesn't even know what an ATM is. This signature on the withdrawal slips didn't match hers at all. I found receipts in Leslie's name for Louis Vuitton bags, Lululemon clothes and Coachella VIP passes worth $2,000, all charged to my grandmother's emergency credit card. Then I found the worst part. Leslie had been making my grandmother sign blank papers for insurance. She told her Leslie had put herself as the sole beneficial.

My boyfriend Mateo literally laughed when I told him I'd signed up for a bikini competition. Babe, you realise those girls have been training for years, right? He said, not even looking up from his PlayStation. You can't even do a push up. I just spent $400 on a competition prep coach and meal plans. His first response was to remind me of my weaknesses. I'm starting somewhere, I said, holding the gym bag I just bought. Everyone does, he snorted. Remember when you wanted to learn guitar? The yoga phase, that expensive camera that's collecting dust. This is just another Tuesday for you, Isla. He ordered pizza that night, extra cheese, made a show of eating it in front of me while I measured out my chicken and rice. Want a bite, he asked. Cheese stringing from his mouth. Oh, wait, you're an athlete mode now. His friends thought it was hilarious when he told them over discord. Arlo, my trainer, noticed immediately at our first real session. Rough morning, he asked, seeing my eyes still puffy from crying in my car. My boyfriend thinks this is stupid. I admitted adjusting my new workout gloves. He keeps saying I'm wasting money. Arlo set down the weights he was organizing. You know what I think is stupid? People who tear down someone trying to better themselves. You're here at 5:00am. That's not stupid. That's Dedication. Over the next few weeks, Arlo became my biggest cheerleader. He'd stay after sessions to help me perfect my posing, always maintaining professional distance, but offering endless encouragement. That's it. You're getting stronger every day. When I finally hit my first unassisted pull up, he brought the gym owner over to witness my next one. You gotta see this. EASA couldn't hang for two seconds. When she started, watch, this entire morning crew started clapping. Mateo never asked about my progress, not once. Your boyfriend coming to the competition, Arlo asked one day spotting me on bench press. I almost dropped the bar. He, he has a thing. That day I lied. Arlo helped me rack the weight. Aila, I've trained a lot of people. You know what the successful ones have in common? Support systems, partners who meal prep with them, who celebrate every pound lifted, every inch lost. I thought about Mateo's thing, a gaming tournament he had planned for months. The same day as my first competition. He hadn't even pretended to check if he could reschedule. My ex girlfriend competed. Arlo continued. I was front row at every show. That's what you do when you love some.

He controls every penny I spend. But her lawyer said, your honor, I need to withdraw from this case immediately. I'm Pete. And six weeks ago, Denise served me divorce papers at our daughter's piano recital. Real classy. She claimed I was financially controlling and emotionally distant, demanding 60% of my plumbing business, the house and primary custody of our daughter Zoe. The thing is, Denise had been acting strange for months. She'd started a life coaching business, acquired her to attend weekend retreats in Sedona, buy thousands in crystals and courses and maintain multiple social media accounts about manifesting wealth. I supported her even when she maxed out three credit cards on business expenses. In court that Tuesday morning in Tulsa, Denise's attorney, Mr Vaughn, was crushing it. He painted me as this controlling husband who questioned every purchase while I apparently lived like a king. Denise had actually coached three of her friends to testify about how broken she seemed. Mister Rodriguez has kept his wife on an allowance, Vaughn announced. Meanwhile, he spent freely on boats and motorcycles. I didn't own boat. The motorcycle was a 1992 Honda I bought for $800 to fix up with Zoe. But Denise's friends nodded along from the gallery like they'd practiced. Here's what Denise didn't know. Five weeks earlier, I got a call from American Express about unusual charges on a card I didn't recognize. Turns Out Denise had opened four credit cards using my Social Security number, racking up $67,000 in debt, buying inventory for an MLM scheme selling Healing Water. But that's not why her lawyer quit. See, I'd hired my own investigator not to follow Denise, figure out where our money was going. He discovered Denise wasn't just in one MLM, she was in seven. Each one promising she'd be a founding Diamond member if she recruited enough people. Her biggest recruit, her divorce lawyer's wife. Vaughn's wife, had invested $30,000 of their retirement savings into Denise's wellness empire, mortgaging their vacation home to buy inventory. Text did von received during court, his wife panicking because the Federal Trade Commission had frozen the MLM's assets that morning for operating as an illegal pyramid scheme. When von pointed at me, he said, Mr Rodriguez's attorney filed the FTC complaint that triggered this morning's raid. My wife is named in the investigation. I cannot continue. The judge called a recess. Denise tried to chase after von, screaming about betrayal and lost investments. Three friends literally ran out of the courtroom when they heard FTC investigation. My attorney then submitted evidence showing Denise had recruited 17 people, including her own mother, into pyramid schemes using our joint assets as proof of success. She'd been showing fake bank statements claiming we were millionaires to convince people to invest. The judge didn't even deliberate. Mrs. Rodriguez, not only are you getting nothing from this divorce, will be liable For all debts incurred through identity theft and fraud, custody goes to Mister Rodriguez. But the cascade was just beginning. The FTC investigation revealed Denise had been using our address as a shipping hub for the MLM products. We had 200.

So I exposed her and called the cops. When Grandpa died, the whole family was shattered. He'd been the center of everything. Holidays, birthdays, backyard barbecues. He wasn't rich, but he had a nice house, a good amount of savings, and heirlooms that meant the world to us. We all expected things to be divided fairly. So when my cousin Amanda called a family meeting and said she had Grandpa's will, we all showed up. She stood at the front of her living room like she was hosting a game show, holding a folder with this smug little smile. Grandpa left everything to me, she said. The house, the money, the land, all of it. He trusted me to take care of things. The room went silent. Then chaos. My uncle slammed his hand on the table, my mom started crying, and Amanda just kept repeating, it's legal. There's nothing you can do about it. She laid the will out on the table, and sure enough, it looked official. Stand, signatures, the whole deal. A few relatives even started whispering that maybe Grandpa really had given her everything. Amanda leaned into it, pretending to be gracious. Don't worry. I'll let you visit the house sometimes. And maybe if you're respectful, I'll share a little. The arrogance made my blood boil. But more than that, it didn't make sense. Grandpa was fair to a fault. He Always split things evenly, even when it caused fights. Him giving everything to Amanda? No way. I asked to see the will. She smirked, clearly thinking I just wanted to torture myself with proof. I snapped photos of every page while she wasn't looking too closely. That night, I sat at my desk and compared the signature to old birthday cards Grandpa had written me. That's when I saw it. The signature was too perfect. Smooth lines, no shakiness. Grandpa's hands trembled every time he held a pen. And the notary stamp? It was dated years after the notary's license had expired. The will was a fake. The next day, I went straight to Grandpa's lawyer. The moment he saw the photos, his expression changed. He pulled out a file and showed me the real will. Signed years ago, properly notarized and witnessed. In that will, everything was divided fairly. The house to his kids, the savings split among the grandkids, the keepsakes to specific people. Exactly what we all expected. This, the lawyer said. Holding Amanda's version is forgery and it's a crime. At the next meeting, Amanda came strutting in again with her fake will, acting like she already owned the house we were sitting in. A few family members were starting to cave, saying maybe we should just accept Grandpa's wishes and avoid a fight. Amanda lapped it up, promising she'd take care of everyone. Then the lawyer walked in. He dropped two folders on the table. Amanda's forgery and the real will from his office. He explained everything. The expired notary stamp, the traced signature, even a handwriting expert's analysis confirming the forgery. Amanda's face went pale. This is a mistake, she said.

So I turned him from Mister Popular to Mister Loser overnight. My brother Kyle has always thought the world revolves around him. He's 17, the golden child, and my parents practically treat him like royalty. If there's one slice of cake left, it's Kyle's. If chores need to be divided, Kyle gets exempted because he has basketball practice. When I 15 years old, I asked for new shoes and I was told to wait until Christmas. Kyle, on the other hand, gets brand new sneakers every season because he needs them for the team. But the worst part? He believes his opinions are facts. He'll say things like, girls shouldn't wear hoodies, it makes them look sloppy, or, short hair is for boys, long hair is for real girls. He says it with so much confidence that my parents just nod along instead of shutting him down. I've always liked my hair short. It's easy to wash, easy to style, and I feel like myself with it. My friends say it suits me. Kyle, however, hated it. From the moment I chopped it to my shoulders last year, he constantly nagged me. You look like a boy. No guy is ever gonna like you like that. Maybe you should try wearing a dress so people don't confuse you. I usually ignored him, but one Saturday morning, he crossed the line. I was sitting in the living room scrolling Through my phone. When Kyle came up behind me, he had Scissors in his hand. My mom's sewing Scissors, to be exact. Before I even realized what he was doing, he grabbed a fistful of my hair and snipped. I froze. The sound of the blade slicing through was sharp and final. A chunk of my hair slid down onto the couch. What the hell, Kyle? I screamed, jumping up. He laughed. Laughed? Relax. You already look like a boy. So what's a little trim? Consider it an improvement. I wanted to cry. But more than that, I wanted revenge. Kyle was Mister Popular at school. Everyone adored him. The teachers, the cheerleaders, even the principal. His reputation was spotless. Star athlete, funny guy, and supposedly a great brother. I knew the last part was a lie. And I wanted the whole school to know it, too. That night, I hatched a plan. On Sunday, I told Kyle I'd forgiven him. I even acted nice. Made him popcorn, let him use the TV. Didn't tattle to our parents. He bought it, of course. Because Kyle thinks apologies flow to him, not from him. Then, while he was snoring on the couch that night, I put my plan into action. I had borrowed my mom's electric razor. With my phone, flashlight and nerves of steel, I pressed the buzzing clippers against the side of his head. A whole strip of hair came off. Instantly he stirred, but didn't wake up. Within 15 minutes, his perfect basketball boy haircut was gone. In its place, a freshly shaved, lumpy, uneven head. Kyle's skull isn't smooth. There's this weird bump on the back, and one side is flatter than the other. With hair, no one notices. Without hair, it looks like a topographical map. The next morning, Kyle woke up screaming. What did you do to my hair? I shrugged. Relax. You already look like a clown. So what's a little trim? Consider it an improvement. His jaw dropped. I had used

I fix problems, cover my bills and earn more than people think. Still, my family looks down on me. My sister, Amanda, law school and I've been footing the Bill, tuition, laptop, textbooks.

She was scared her doctor boyfriend, Craig, would judge her if he met me. The plumber brother let that sink in. I was too embarrassing to sit at the same table, the same sister who needed me to pay her law school bills. The signs were there all along.

And my parents, they agreed with her. They thought it was fine to leave. Me out that night, I lay awake boiling. Not the loud screaming kind of anger, the cold kind, the kind that makes you think clearly, if I was too embarrassing for Christmas, then my money was too embarrassing for tuition. Two weeks later, the spring Bill was due, $21,500. Usually, Amanda would remind me 10 times. This time she just assumed I'd pay. I called her. She answered sharp, like I was interrupting. What's up? Oh, just checking. I said your tuitions do soon, right? Her voice flipped sweet. Yes. Thank you for remembering. You'll cover it, right? I took a breath. Funny thing I heard you told mom I shouldn't come to Christmas. Something about me being a plumber and Craigslist family thinking less of you. Dead silence. Finally, she stammered. That's not.

The grocery store security footage showed my face hitting the floor. Blood pooled around my head where I cracked it on the tile. When I woke up in the hospital, I immediately threw up blood. You're literally starving to death, the doctor told me. I tried to sit up, but the room spun violently. I need to get back to work. Rent is due tomorrow. She pushed me back down. You're 16 years old and you weigh 80 pounds. Can't be right. When did you last eat a meal? Three days ago, I think. She looked horrified. Where are your parents right now? In the basement, playing their online game, like always. They don't know you're dying? They told me not to bother them unless someone is dead. You almost were dead. Almost doesn't count according to them. She glanced at my chart. You work two jobs and go to school. I work at four in the morning delivering newspapers. Then I go to school, then I work at the grocery store until midnight. That's physically impossible. Red Bull and gas station pills make it possible. You're taking stimulant. I have to pay rent or we get evicted. Your parents don't have jobs? They quit two years ago to become professional gamers. Are they making money from gaming? I laughed. They've made exactly zero dollars. But they keep saying fame is coming any day now. How much sleep are you getting? My thoughts kept slipping away like water through my fingers. Three hours on a good night, but usually less. Do you ever feel dizzy or confused? Every single day. But I can push through it. She stared at me in disbelief. Your parents make you work while they stay home gaming all day? They're trying to build their streaming career. They need my support. She examined my arms, which looked like twigs. Your 40 pounds underweight because you're feeding them instead of yourself. You don't understand. They should be able to follow their dreams after the sacrifices they made for me. My manager, Jimmy, had been sitting in the corner listening. He finally spoke up, looking sick with guilt. I should have said something sooner. This kid has been falling apart for months. He has been seeing things at work that aren't real. The doctor turned to him quickly. What kind of things? Yesterday he was having full conversations with nobody for 20 minutes straight. I felt my face get hot. Sometimes when I'm really tired, I see shadows.

Lucy chose my birthday dinner to tell me she needed space. We were at the restaurant I booked two months ago, and I was literally holding the gift I'd gotten her when she dropped this bomb on me. I need to find myself. You're always texting and calling me. I can't breathe. I felt my stomach drop. What was she talking about? I need to be alone to figure out who I am, she continued. She kept glancing at something under the table and smiling. Brad thinks. I mean, my friend thinks time apart helps people grow, she said. My heart started racing when she said Brad. She caught herself, but kept talking like nothing happened. I need you to stop contacting me. Complete. She was already standing to leave while my birthday cake sat untouched between us. How long? I asked. However long it takes, she said. I looked at her standing there, ready to abandon me on my birthday. Okay. Take all the distance you need, I said. Her face changed completely. She'd expected me to beg. Really? Just like that? She asked you said you need it. She left so fast, she forgot butter jacket. That night, Lucy sent me 12 messages. I watched each one pop up, getting more desperate. I miss you, but this is healthy. The first said, please just say something. Read the last. I turned off red receipts and went to bed. She Wanted to be alone, so that's what she got. The next morning, Amy, our mutual friend, called me. Lucy's having a panic attack. She thinks you're dead or something, Amy said. I almost laughed at the irony. She asked to find herself. I'm helping, I explained, by ignoring her. Amy sounded confused. By giving her exactly what she requested. There was a long pause before Amy spoke again. She didn't mean it like that, Amy said. Then she should have said what she meant, I replied. Amy couldn't argue with Lucy's own words. Lucy showed up at my work during lunch, and my co workers watched her march up to my desk. We need to talk, she announced loudly. I kept typing and didn't look up. I'm at work. You're on your journey, I said calmly. Stop saying that, she yelled. People were definitely staring now, and I felt embarrassed for her. You're embarrassing yourself. I'm just respecting boundaries, I said. Security walked over and asked if there was a problem. She stormed out, humiliated, and I actually felt bad for a second until I remembered Brad's name.

I was desperately hunting for a cheap apartment after my roommate bailed on me last minute. Had exactly three weeks to find something under $800 or I'd be sleeping in my car. The panic was real. I'd already calculated how many meals I could skip to scrape together a security deposit, and the math wasn't pretty. Scrolled through dozens of sketch she Craiglist post for hours every night. My laptop screen burning my eyes as I refreshed. Obsessively visited places with holes in walls and mysterious stains that landlords carefully described as character. One place had a bathroom door that didn't close. Another had windows painted shut and a lingering smell I couldn't identify. My standards dropped daily. First week, I wanted hardwood floors and natural light. Second week, I just wanted functional plumbing. Third week, I was ready to negotiate on the plumbing. Was getting pretty defeated when I saw this listing. $750 needs some work, which usually means uninhabitable. But at this point, uninhabitable was looking pretty habitable to me. The address was in this rundown neighborhood on the outskirts where street lights were more suggestions than actual illumination. Almost didn't go, but desperation wins over common sense every time. Pulled up to what looked like an abandoned house. Peeling paint hung off the siding like sunburned skin. The yard was so overgrown, it looked like nature was actively trying to reclaim the property. And a broken Fence leaned at impossible angles. Perfect. Exactly what my life needed right then. Knocked on the door, half expecting no answer. But footsteps shuffled inside, and this elderly woman answered. Had to be 80, wearing a faded floral dress. Her white hair was pinned back neatly, and despite the house's exterior, she looked dignified.

My teacher made us all have assigned seating and I got stuck in the back next to the quiet kid. He always weirded me out. Never talked to anyone. Just drew these weird, dark sketches in his notebook during lectures. But that Tuesday morning started normal. I was trying to stay awake when a piece of paper slid onto my desk from his direction. Note was folded into a tight square and when I opened it, his handwriting was surprisingly neat. Enjoy your last few minutes alive. My first thought was that this was some weird prank. Maybe he was finally trying to make friends in the most awkward way possible. So I turned back to give him a confused look, but his face was serious. Another note hit my desk, just one word, look. I glanced back and saw his backpack partially open, something dark and metallic visible inside. It was a handgun. My hands started shaking so bad I dropped my pencil. Our teacher was writing formulas and had no idea what was going on. 28 other students in the room. My mind raced through the options. I could run out the door right now, save myself, but everyone else would be at risk. I could yell at everyone to run, but his hand was already halfway in his bag and I'd probably be first. I could pull the fire alarm, but it was across the Room. My stomach churned and I genuinely thought I might throw up right there on my desk. Then it hit me, the bathroom pass. I, it asked to go to the bathroom, walk past it to the office, warn them quietly. They could call the police, lock down the school, do it properly. My throat felt like sandpaper when I raised my hand, Mister Peterson, can I use the bathroom? He barely looked up, just nodded and pointed to the pass by the door. I stood up, my legs feeling like jelly, trying to look normal, casual, like I wasn't about to potentially let 29 people die or get myself killed trying to save them. I grabbed the wooden bathroom pass, my hands sweating so much it almost slipped. As I reached the door, I heard another voice. Hey, can I go, too? I turned around and it was him. My heart stopped. Just wait until he gets back. But he was already standing up. It's an emergency. Sadly, something in his voice made our teacher wave him through. I was walking as fast as I could, but he was right behind me in the hallway, his footsteps matching mine, his hand still in his pocket. The bathroom was 10 feet ahead on the left. The office was another 30 feet. Asked it on the right. If I walked past the bathroom, he'd know. If I went into the bathroom, everyone would die. The hallway seemed to stretch forever. Those Ugly green lockers on both sides, the fluorescent lights humming overhead, a water fountain dripping somewhere. I could feel his presence behind me like a shadow, hear his breathing steady and calm, while mine came in short gasps. Five feet from the bathroom door, 4 feet, 3 feet. My body was screaming at me to just go in, be safe, let someone else deal with this. Then I made my choice. I walked past it. His footsteps stopped for a second and I knew he knew. I turned the corner and broke into a sprint. My sneak.

He'd walk up to groups and say things like, ugh, why are you girls always talking about makeup? I'd rather discuss philosophy or sports. Then she'd flip her hair and wait for guys to notice how different and cool she was. Madison would post these cringe captions like just a girl who prefers books over boys and hiking over heels while literally only hanging out with guys and constantly seeking their validation. The worst part was how she'd trash other girls behind their backs. She tell guys things like, Jessica is so fake with all that makeup or Sarah is just another basic girl who only cares about shopping. But she always said it with this sweet, concerned voice like she was just being honest. This went on for two years.

Then we had this big group project where we had to present our dream careers. Madison got up there talking about how she wanted to be a marine biologist because she was passionate about saving the oceans and not materialistic like other girls. Right after her presentation, our teacher pulled up Madison's public social media on the projector to show an example of professional Online presence, her entire feed was designer clothes, makeup halls, shopping sprees and thirst trap selfies with captions like retail therapy hits different and makeup is my art. There were literally zero posts about marine biology, the environment or anything she claimed to care about. The guys she'd been trying to impress just started laughing. One of them said, so much for not being materialistic. Madison's whole I'm different persona crumbled in 30 seconds.

She said, I'm not ready to close doors. What if someone better comes along? I was coming upstairs with groceries and heard everything. I left the groceries and her house key on the counter. Someone better did come along. Her sister Rachel and I had been together for three years. We were serious, spending most nights together, had keys to each other's places, met both families. I was planning to propose in the spring. That December, we were staying at her mom's house for her birthday weekend. Rachel had forgotten ingredients for dinner, so I volunteered to drive to the store. I spent 40 minutes getting everything, plus flowers for her mom's birthday. Their house had a split level entry where you come in through the garage and go up steps into the kitchen. I had just opened the door with four bags of groceries when I heard her mom's voice. When is Matt going to propose? You two have been together forever. I paused on the steps, curious about Rachel's answer. Mom, seriously, not this again. Rachel replied, what? You're not getting any younger. He's a good man. Stable job, treats you well. Yeah, Matt's great. But then came the words that shattered everything. I'm not ready to close doors, you know, what if someone better comes along? That's a good guy, but I don't know if he's my forever guy. I froze. Three bags suddenly feeling like they weighed 1,000 pounds. I'm not saying he's a backup. I'm just. I don't know. He's safe, dependable. But sometimes I wonder if there's more excitement out there. I quietly set the grocery bags on the kitchen counter, along with the flowers with the Happy Birthday card still attached. And I placed my key to Rachel's apartment right next to the groceries. I turned around, went back to my car, and drove to a hotel 20 minutes away. Didn't say a word. My phone exploded 20 minutes later. Where are you? Did you just drop the groceries and leave? What's going on? I texted back once I heard what you said to your mom. We're done. I'll get my things when you're at work. Then I muted her note.

His profile showed luxury cars, expensive watches, occupation listed as entrepreneur, green eyes, Irish accent, talked about bottle feeding lambs on his childhood farm. I was gone. First date, he asked about my hobbies instead of my cases. Didn't mention his yacht or try to impress me with legal war stories. Just listened. I broke my rule and slept with him that night. Patrick was perfect. Cleaned my apartment on his days off, walked my dog, brought my mother 100 roses. When they met, said he worked cyber security after his m I t. Computer science degree, made money in crypto. His phone constantly pinged with trading notifications. All things didn't add up. His work hours changed weekly. Never drove those luxury cars from his profile, never wore those expensive watches. Suggested Olive Garden when my usual place was booked. I appreciate fine dining. I mentioned once foods, food, he'd say, studying the menu like it mattered. I ignored it all because when I mentioned a tough case, he'd massage my shoulders exactly where they hurt. When I worked late, he'd have dinner waiting. When I doubted myself, he'd list every reason I was brilliant. Seven months in, I decided to grab Taco Bell after a deposition. Ran late. Hadn't eaten fast food in years, but Nothing else was open. Walked in and froze. Patrick stood behind the counter in a uniform, name tag and all our eyes met. His face went white. Can I help you? He asked, voice cracking. What are you doing here? I work here since when? Since before we met. The m I t degree, the cyber security job, the crypto fortune, all lies. He was a Taco Bell employee who'd borrowed a friend's car for profile photos, used old pictures from when he'd tried modelling, created an entire fake life. Why was all I managed?

My sister cornered me in the kitchen after Thanksgiving dinner and pulled out an actual ruler to measure our engagement rings. Yours is 2 millimeters wider than mine and you need to exchange it immediately, she said, grabbing my hand so hard it hurt. Older sisters get the bigger diamonds. My fiance had saved for two years to buy my ring and I wasn't returning it. That's not how engagement rings work, I said. Mine is a full carat and yours is clearly 1.5. She said, pulling out a jeweler's loop, either you downgrade or I'll make sure that ring disappears. You're insane, I said. That agrees that it's embarrassing for the older daughter to have the smaller diamond. She said, when people notice, they'll think my husband loves me less. Her husband looked exhausted when she dragged him in to back her up and he mentioned he'd already spent 20,000 on her ring. Two weeks later, she filed a lawsuit claiming I deliberately chosen a larger diamond to humiliate her and damage her marriage. She hired a gemologist as an expert witness to testify about the psychological impact of diamond size disparities between siblings and demanded I be forced to downgrade to a half carat ring. She brought charts showing how cultures worldwide respected birth order in jewelry distribution and tried to get a restraining order preventing me from wearing my ring in public. The judge asked If this was a joke before dismissing it. But she stood up and accused him of not understanding sister dynamics and diamond hierarchies. After months of her posting comparison photos of our rings online, she showed up at my engagement party with what she claimed with a 3 carat diamond upgrade. She made everyone stop to admire it. But when she held it up to the light, it was obviously cubic zirconia from the way it sparkled. Wrong. Her husband admitted he couldn't afford an upgrade, so she bought it herself. And when people realised it was fake, she screamed that at least it was bigger than mine. She pulled out a portable diamond tester to prove mine was fake, too. But when it confirmed mine was real, she threw it at the wall and said the machine was broken. She decided to steal my ring by staging an elaborate heist at my apartment. She hired actors from Craigslist to pretend to be maintenance workers while she snuck in through the bathroom window. But she got stuck halfway through. She dangled there for two hours trying to wiggle free. And when she finally.

We attend the annual family gathering every year at my mother's house. This time halfway through dinner, I realized my eight year old Aurora had been missing too long. I found her sobbing in the upstairs bathroom. Her beautiful blonde hair completely shaved off, patches of stubble where the clippers had missed. My sister Brianna stood there filming on her phone laughing. It's just a joke. Brianna's always been jealous growing up. She cut holes in my prom dress, spilled wine on my wedding dress. Mom always dismissed it as just playing around. But this crossed every line. She needed to learn not to be so vain, Brianna said. Luke and Aria held her still while I gave her a makeover. She showed me the video. Aurora struggling while my nephew and niece pinned her arms, crying and begging them to stop. As Brianna and clippers over her head laughing. Other adults gathered in the hallway. Some looked shocked, others struggled to hide smiles. My mother appeared. What's going on? Dinner is getting cold. Look what your daughter did, I said, turning my sobbing child toward her. Mom barely glanced. It's not stylish, but it'll grow back. They held her down against her will. She's traumatized. Posted the video to the Family chat. Brianna announced it's hilarious. Maybe now people will notice something about her besides her hair. I saw the pure jealousy in my sister's eyes, the same look she'd given me our entire childhood. I stood slowly carrying Aurora toward the stairs. Where do you think you're going? Brianna called. Don't be such a killjoy. You're overreacting, mom said. Brianna didn't mean any harm. I stopped. A prank is a whoopee cushion. This was assault. Brianna sauntered down, still recording. I lunged for the phone, but she danced backward. Can't take a joke. That's when I slapped my sister hard across the face, knocking the phone from her hand. The room went silent. If you ever come near my daughter again, I will press charges for assault on a minor. I deleted the video from her phone. You can't delete it.

She kept hovering over our table, refilling water glasses that were already full, clearly checking if we were going to dine and dash. Other tables got bread baskets immediately. But we sat there for 20 minutes before she grudgingly brought ours. Marcus ordered the steak dinner. She actually questioned him, are you sure you can afford that? It's $38. The table next to us heard this and started staring. Marcus looked embarrassed and started second guessing his order. I told him to get whatever he wanted. It was his birthday. She brought our food 40 minutes later, stone cold. Marcus's steak was completely overcooked despite ordering it medium rare. When I, I politely asked her to have it re cooked, she huffed and said the kitchen doesn't make mistakes. Maybe your son just doesn't understand fine dining. Other customers were now openly watching our table, some looking sympathetic, others seeming entertained by our treatment. Marcus was getting more upset by the minute. This was supposed to be his special night. That's when I'd had enough, politely asked to speak with the manager. She Smirked and said, he's very busy tonight, but I'll see what I can do. While we waited, she continued ignoring our table completely. When the manager finally appeared, she immediately started complaining about difficult customers. Before I could speak, I smiled and pulled out my business card. I'm actually the food critic for the Metro Times. I've been documenting this entire experience for my weekly restaurant review column. Her face went completely white. The manager looked horrified. I continued, your waitress has provided me with enough material for a very interesting piece about service discrimination and upscale establishments. The manager immediately comped our entire meal and personally served us dessert. The waitress disappeared for the rest of the evening. Marcus got his perfect birthday dinner after all.

I just let them talk because they had no idea. I'd already transferred all my assets into a trust fund they couldn't touch. Walking into my parents house that evening, the tension was thick. My dad had texted requesting a formal family meeting about my grandmother's estate. My grandmother Martha passed away last month, leaving me a substantial inheritance. She'd been my mentor, teaching me everything about money and financial responsibility. My brother Jonathan was the opposite. While I saved, he spent. Our parents constantly bailed him out. Mom made my favorite lasagna. She only did that when she wanted something. Dad cleared his throat. Alexandra, family is the most important thing. We believe in supporting each other. Mom jumped in. Your brother has creditors breathing down his neck, Jonathan. I made some investments that didn't pan out. Then dad dropped it. We've decided to use your inheritance to clear Jonathan's debts. The casual way he said it left me momentarily speechless. They weren't asking. They decided. You're doing well financially, mom added. You don't really need this money the way Jonathan does. I kept my face neutral. How much? About $250,000, Dad said. I nearly choked. That was likely everything grandma left me. We already spoke to Martha's lawyer, mom continued. Since you're family, it should be straightforward to redirect the funds. They contacted the lawyer before even telling me. Tell me more about these debts, I asked Jonathan. He shifted uncomfortably. Business loans, mostly. Some credit cards. What complications require $250,000? Jonathan snapped. Why does it matter? You're sitting on cash you didn't earn. The least you could do is help family. I excused myself to the bathroom. Passing Dad's office, I noticed a folder labeled Jonathan's Finances. Inside were records of previous bailouts totaling over $100,000, none repaid. Screenshots of Jonathan's social media showing luxury vacations, an email from his ex warning about his gambling problem. I took photos of everything. When I returned, I asked.

I show up at this upscale restaurant with a gift bag in my best. The hostess smiles. You must be Mason. Now my name is Mason. So I go, yep, that's me. She leads me to a private room where everyone erupts and cheers. A guy hugs me. Grandpa's gonna lose it when he sees you. Wait, Grandpa? That's when I realized I don't know a single person in this room. I try to play it cool. I hand the gift back to the nearest person and mutter, it's just something small. She tears up and goes, you always were thoughtful. I'm now emotionally invested. Dinner starts. I fake laugh. I say things like, classic grandpa, and he really did love his lawn. I even sign a guest book. Then Grandpa stands and points at me. This young man. This is who I was telling you about. Everyone claps. I feel so guilty, so I finally blurted out, okay, I have to fess. I think I'm at the wrong party. I thought this was a birthday dinner for someone named Sarah. Dead silence. Then Grandpa goes, well, Mason or not, you're still the best part of this night. The whole room cheers. Again, someone yells, keep him! Someone else hands me cake. They made me join the family photo. Now I'm in their group chat. And honestly, I'm not leaving because they just invited me to the cabin this summer, and I kind of miss that grandpa.

I thought my friends who were right there with me would help and they all burst out laughing. One even joked it looked like you've been shot. I couldn't believe it. I was on the ground struggling and the people I trusted most thought it was funny. But then something unexpected happened. The most feared guy in my school, well, someone who never really interacted with me, came running over. He saw what had happened and thought it was unacceptable. He helped me to the medical room while my friends stayed back laughing. When I returned school the next day after going to the hospital and filing a police report, some of those same friends thought it would be hilarious to poke the giant bruise on my back. They didn't even ask if I was okay. They just kept laughing. It wasn't until years later after starting therapy that I fully understood how much that incident hurt me, not just physically but emotionally.

There was this rich kid at my college named Tyler who thought he was hot stuff because his family owned a chain of restaurants. He drove a BMW, wore designer clothes to lectures and had this posse of wannabes following him around campus. His favorite victim was this older student named Maria, who cleaned the dorms at night to pay for nursing school. Tyler would trash his room right before she came on shift, leaving pizza boxes and beer cans everywhere. He'd prop his door open so everyone could watch her clean up his mess while he made comments. Look at this, guys, he'd say loudly. Some people go to college, others just clean up after college students. Maria never said anything, just did her job quietly. Tyler thought this was hilarious. He started filming her working and posting videos online with captions like, when you can't afford tuition, so you become the help instead. One Thursday night, Tyler was putting on his usual show. He'd invited half the floor to watch him mess with Maria. She was emptying his trash when he deliberately knocked over a full ash tray, covering her uniform in ash. Clean that up, too, while you're at it. He laughed. That's when this guy from down the hall walked over. Nobody really knew him well, just some quiet senior who kept to himself. Excuse me. He said to Tyler in perfect Spanish, you're being disrespectful to my mother, the Entire hallway went silent. Tyler looked confused. Your mother? The guy switched to English so everyone could understand. Maria Gonzales, the woman you've been humiliating for months is my mother. She works three jobs to pay for my pre med classes and her own nursing degree. Tyler's face went white. I was just, he started, but the guy cut him off. You were just what? Bullying a woman who has more education and work ethic than you'll ever have. Turns out Maria had a master's degree from Mexico and was only cleaning to support her family while getting her US nursing certification. She spoke four languages fluently. Tyler got reported to the dean and lost his campus housing privileges.

Three days later, she was calling me frantically to undo what I did. I've been dating Eliza for almost two years. She worked marketing. I run security consultancy, cameras, smart locks, surveillance systems. We had a good thing going, or so I thought. From day one. I heard about Kyle, her ex. They dated three years before breaking up a year before we met. Kyle's new job, Kyle's vacation photos, Kyle's family drama, his name came up constantly. I figured some people stay friends with exes. Six months in, Eliza's company needed a security upgrade. I helped them out professionally. She started helping with my marketing materials. Everything seemed collaborative. Then came my 29th birthday. Eliza organized everything. Dinner at an upscale place, inviting our closest friends. The day before, she casually mentioned, oh, by the way, I invited Kyle too. Kyle, your ex? Yeah. Is that okay? He's just a friend now. Something felt off, but I didn't want to seem insecure. Sure, whatever. The night arrived. Table for eight at this beautiful restaurant. We're having drinks, waiting on Kyle. He shows up 20 minutes late with purple dahlias. Eliza's beaming. Kyle hands her the flowers, completely ignoring me. These are for you. He Says, happy spring. It's October. Eliza accepts them, face lighting up. Purple dahlias. It's sweet that you still remember what I like. The table goes silent. Everyone's looking from Kyle to Eliza to me. Kyle finally acknowledges me with a nod. Happy birthday, man. No flowers for the birthday boy. Dinner proceeds like I'm invisible. Kyle dominates conversation, sharing inside jokes with Eliza. He's positioned directly across from her, making constant eye contact. I'm supposedly the guest of honor, but might as well be a ghost. The waiter brings cake with candles. Everyone sings. Eliza puts her arm around me, the first time she's paid attention to me all evening. I stare at the flames, the situation crystal clear. Make a wish, someone says. I look at Eliza, then Kyle, then back at the candles. I wish for clarity, for self respect, for what needs to happen next. I blow out the candles, stand up, toss my napkin down and say, thanks for coming, everyone. I need some air. You're leaving. We haven't even cut the cake. I've lost my appetite. Kyle can have my slice. Seems like he's taking everything else of mine tonight. I walk out, ignoring Eliza calling my name. When I get home, I log.

This contract must be huge if you need all this equipment. What's it worth? Around 40 k commercial property, 3 month project. Why? I wiped grease off my hands with a shop rag. Just curious. It's good you're doing well. He relaxed a little. Then started talking about the property, the scope of work, how this job would set him up for the whole season, how his boss trusted him to handle the equipment. Logistics.

Our principal, Missus Rouse, watched some documentary about school safety over the summer and decided backpacks were dangerous. We had an assembly on the first day of school and she told everyone the new rule. Students, starting immediately, backpacks are banned from campus for safety reasons. My friend Carl raised his hand immediately. How are we supposed to carry five textbooks to binders and a laptop? You'll need to find creative alternatives that prioritize safety. So you want us to be creative? Within reason. That was her first mistake. The next morning, Carl showed up wearing cargo pants with 97 pockets that he'd sewn on himself. His legs looked like two beige tumors and he had to walk sideways through doorways. Every step sounded like somebody shaking a bag of rocks filled with smaller bags of rocks. Carl, what on earth are you wearing? Missus Rouse asked, horrified. Safety conscious pants with built in storage compartments. You can't even walk properly. You said be creative, and walking normally was never mentioned in the student handbook. She watched him shuffle sideways into class like a crab carrying office supplies. Missus Rouse immediately banned massive pockets on clothing. So my friend Molly decided to maliciously comply with style. She rolled into school the next day pulling a full sized filing cabinet on wheels with a rope. Molly, you cannot bring a filing cabinet to school. Why not? It's Not a backpack, and it has zero pockets. Within three days, the hallways looked like an office building during an evacuation. Kids were pulling filing cabinets, desk drawers on skateboards. And one genius brought his entire dresser from home on a furniture dolly. The chemistry teacher, couldn't start class because 17 filing cabinets were blocking the door. And somebody's rolling desk ash down the stairs and took out a water fountain. Missus Rouse band wielded storage, but Molly had already inspired everyone. My friend Ron came to school the next day wearing six leather belts.

In my family, we had to earn our names by age 16. And if we failed the test, we'd be called disappointment for the rest of our lives. While our siblings got beautiful names like Aurora and Phoenix, my parents believe that names were privileges that had to be deserved through proving your worth to the family bloodline. They'd grown up in a cult where children were numbered until they accomplished something significant. And they brought this twisted system into our suburban home. Dad was obsessed with creating superior offspring after being rejected from every graduate program he applied to, while mom had been the family disappointment in her own childhood and was determined to break the cycle through extreme measures. The name test happened on your 16th birthday and was different for each child, designed around your biggest weakness. My older brother, Phoenix, had to survive alone in the woods for 30 days because he was too dependent. My sister, Aurora, had to make $5,000 in one month because she was financially irresponsible. I was labelled as too emotional from age 12, so my parents designed the cruelest test possible. I had to choose one family member to permanently cut from my life, write them a letter explaining why I never wanted to see them again and deliver it in person while they filmed it for proof. Emotional people make weak decisions, dad explained. While handing me the list of family members I could choose from. This will teach you that love is a luxury successful people can't afford. The list included my grandmother who raised me when my parents travelled, my uncle who taught me guitar, and my eight year old cousin Emma, who looked up to me like a big sister. I had 30 days to decide who to destroy or I'd become disappointment forever and lose my college fund, my bedroom and my place.

It was this pearl white situation with subtle silver undertones that caught the light differently depending on the angle. People literally stopped me at Trader Joe's to ask about it. So when I walked into the salon that Tuesday for my touch up and saw Rebecca Thornton in Antoine's chair, I didn't think much of it. Rebecca was, well, she was that woman who drove the white Range Rover and always parked across two spots at the gym. We'd never spoken, but she'd stare at me sometimes, that weird calculating stare. Antwan was sectioning her hair. When he saw me, his face went pale, like actually pale. Hey, Victoria, you're early. No, I'm not. I'm actually five minutes late because someone took forever at the Starbucks drive through. I laughed. Settling into the waiting area, Rebecca's eyes met mine in the mirror. She smiled this tight little smile. Antoine is giving me your look, she announced just like that. Not a similar style or inspired by. She literally said, your look. I remember laughing because what else do you do? Oh, that's flattering. I guess Antoine wouldn't make eye contact with Me, Jenny, his assistant, kept refilling my water like her life depended on it.

When my daughter was three years old, instead of teaching her the word look, I taught her the word behold. And so from that day on, every time she wanted to show me something, she'd tug my arm and say, daddy, daddy, behold. My wife and I thought it was extremely funny and innocent. And it was. Until it wasn't. Fast forward a few weeks. My daughter and I were grocery shopping, and as I was picking out some apples, my daughter started tugging my arm. Daddy, daddy, behold the vegetable. She then pointed at a man in a wheelchair 20 feet away. My jaw dropped and I started laughing my head off. I knew I shouldn't laugh, but hearing my four year old daughter say that combination of words sent me into hysterics. Well, the man turned his head directly at me. He saw me laughing my butt off, all while my daughter was pointing straight at him. He gave me a dirty look and rolled away. And when he did, I felt so embarrassed. I turned to my daughter, who was very confused about what was so funny, and I told her she couldn't point at disabled people or call them that word. What's a disabled person? She innocently asked me. Don't play dumb with me, Missy. I responded, no, I'm serious, daddy. I was a little taken aback. Well, a person in a wheelchair, Is called a disabled person, and the word vegetable should never be used when talking about them. Got it? She nodded. Okay, daddy, but I didn't mean behold the disabled person. I mean behold the vegetables. She then pointed in the same direction she did previously, but now, with the man gone, it was obvious that the whole time she had been pointing at the vegetable aisle.

I have chronic back pain from a car accident, so MRIs are routine for me. I've had dozens. They're boring, loud and I usually fall asleep. This time was different because I made a catastrophic error in judgment. The morning of my scan, I was running late. I threw on the first clothes I could find, grabbed my purse and rushed to the hospital. In the changing room, they gave me the usual spiel, remove all metal, jewelry and electronic devices. I stripped down, put on the gown and shuffled to the machine. the 20 something tech who looked like he'd rather be anywhere else, went through his checklist. Any implants, pacemakers or metal in your body? Nope. Jewelry, piercings or hair clips? All removed. Any electronic devices? Left my phone in the locker. He nodded and helped me onto the table. This should take about 45 minutes. Try to stay completely still. The machine started its typical banging and clicking. I closed my eyes and tried to zone out. About 10 minutes in, I felt a subtle vibration. At first I thought it was the machine. MRIs vibrate, right? But this felt different, more localized, more personal. That's when I remembered what I'd forgotten to remove. Two days earlier, my best friend had thrown me a bachelorette party. The gag gifts included something called the Stealth Stella, a remote controlled device that promised to spice Up your daily routine. We'd all laughed, had too much wine, and somehow I'd been convinced to try it out. I'd forgotten I was wearing it. Now trapped in a magnetic tube worth more than my house, Stealth Stella had apparently decided the MRI's magnetic field was her activation signal. I tried to stay still, but the vibration intensified. The MRI's rhythmic banging seemed to be setting a pace that Stella was enthusiastically matching. Ma'am, you need to stay still, Brad's voice crackled through the intercom. I'm trying, I squeak. The machine banged louder. Stella responded with increased enthusiasm. I bit my lips so hard I tasted blood. Ma'am, your heart rate is elevated. Are you claustrophobic? Something like that. Just 15 more minutes in the sequence. 15 minutes I was going to die or worse. Finish in an MRI machine with Brad watching my vital spike on his monitor. The vibrations reached a crescendo just as the MRI hit its loudest sequence. I gripped the panic button they'd given me but refused to press it. How would I explain? Ma'am, there seems to be some kind.

You ever meet a kid that's just way too smart for their own good? Yeah, that's my daughter Mia. 8 years old. Tiny, curly haired, big brown eyes, the sweetest little smile, and behind it, a brain that works like a full time con artist. Me and her dad, Mark, had been separated for about a year. Nothing dramatic. No screaming matches, no lawyers banging on tables. We just stopped working. We only talked to swap Mia back and forth, and even that was dry. Drop off at 5? Yeah. Okay, that was it. Apparently, Mia decided that was unacceptable. One Friday at my place, she's sitting at the table coloring. She looks up and goes, mom, you ever think about dad? I'm like, sure, honey. Why? She just shrugs. I think you should talk more. I tell her, we're fine, baby. We just live different lives now. She doesn't say another word. Just goes back to her crayons. The next weekend, she's at her dad's when he opens her backpack to get her homework folder. There's a folded pink note inside. From mom, she says. He opens it. Neat handwriting, signed with a little heart. It says, I miss the way we used to laugh. Maybe we should talk. Mark reads it twice. Feels weird, but a little warm inside. Next Friday at drop off. Instead of the usual quick here you go by. He lingers for A second, says, hey, how's work? I'm caught off guard, but I answer. We smile just a little, Mia standing between us, holding both our hands, looking like she just won an award. The week after that, she's back with me. I open her lunch box to clean it and see a folded blue note. She says, it's from dad. I open it, says, I've been thinking about us. Maybe we can try again. My heart jumps. Mark hadn't said anything like that in a year. I just smiled. Next drop off, I don't just hand her over. I ask him, how's your mom doing? He smiles. We chat for a minute. We both laugh at something stupid. Mia says she's beaming like it's Christmas morning. Week after week, it keeps happening. Little notes, sweet words. No questions asked. Neither of us thinks to confirm anything. I just believe. And every Friday, during the hand off, we talk longer. We start making eye contact again, smiling without realizing it. One time, he reaches out and tucks my hair behind my ear without thinking. Feel my stomach flip. One Friday, it's pouring rain. He offers to walk me to my car under his umbrella. After drop off, we're standing there in the rain, laughing at how soaked me his backpack got. I look up at him, he looks at me. And just like that, it's there again. That old feeling. Week later, we meet for coffee, just to talk. Coffee turns Into dinner. Dinner turns into, hey, let's do this again. Before I even realise what's happening, we're back together. No big dramatic moment, just slowly falling back in step. And through all of it, Mia is glowing, acting extra sweet, hugging us both at the same time, making us sit together at her soccer games instead of on opposite sides of the field. Then comes the bomb. It's a week after we're officially back.

Is that your church outfit? I whispered. My scrubs are covered in blood, she whispered back. This was my only option. We slipped into a pew near the back. My sister Pamela shot me a look that could freeze hellfire. Her husband, Roy, always the peacemaker, gave us a weak smile. The whispers started immediately. In a small congregation where everyone knew everyone, we stood out like neon signs. I heard someone behind us mutter, who brings a prostitute to a baptism? Trinity stiffened side me. I grabbed her hand. The baptism began and we tried to blend in. But when they called Family members forward to pray over little Marcus. Pamela reluctantly motioned for us to come up. As we walked down the aisle, an elderly woman actually gasped. Pastor Williams, a man who looked like he'd been preaching since Moses, quinted at us over his glasses. And you are? I'm Marcus's Uncle Terrell, I said. This is my girlfriend, Doctor Trinity Hayes. Doctor, someone whispered skeptically. The prayer circle formed, but people kept their distance from us like we were contagious. When Pastor Williams asked for blessings for the child, one woman loudly prayed, Lord, protect this innocent baby from bad influences and those who profit from sin. Trinity's hand tightened in mine. After the baptism, we headed to the church basement for the reception. We barely gotten our plates of fried chicken when Deacon Crawford cornered me. Son, this is a house of god.

I thought it was just a normal date night. I wore the outfit he picked. Cute little skirt, oversized sweater. We were staying at this hotel downtown. Had dinner plans and everything. In the elevator up to our four, he leaned in and whispered, I want you to leave your underwear in my pocket. I thought he was joking. I laughed, but he just stared. Door closed, silence. So I reached under my skirt and did it. The second the door opened, he said, walk ahead of me, slower. I could feel him watching the whole way to our room. When we got inside, I expected him to jump me right away, but he didn't. He just sat on the bed and said, go sit in the window. I was like, what? He nodded toward the corner. Sweet window, 20 floors up, looking right over the city. I sat, heart pounding, skirt barely covering anything. He still didn't move. Just looked at me and said, now keep looking out like you're waiting for someone, and don't move until I say so. I didn't know what was coming next, but I wasn't about to say no. Follow for part two.

The first time I met Kayla's mother, she ordered a 300 dollar bottle of wine but suggested I might prefer something from the bar menu. When the check came, she let it sit in front of me, just sat there watching. Then she reached across, slowly picked it up and said, I've got this one. Loud enough for the next table to hear. Kayla squeezed my hand under the table, but I caught the message. That night I looked up how to buy cheap houses and fix them up to sell. We've been dating for two years. I figured I had time to prove myself. Three months later, I bought my first broken house nobody wanted but kept it quiet. At Easter brunch, her mother kept switching between polite and dismissive. She say something like, pass the bread, dear, then immediately mention her friend's daughter marrying into old money. I caught her studying my target blazer, then my scuffed shoes. I just sat there drinking orange juice from a crystal glass. Kayla asked me later why I was quiet. I told her I was tired from work. She said her mom was warming up to me.

She suggested maybe I could fix her parents deck. I agreed, knowing I was building something else entirely. Month 10, her mother started noting when I showed up late.

When my daughter was 16, she got rear ended by a drunk driver while stopped at a red light. The guy was clearly wasted, failed three sobriety tests. But somehow his expensive lawyer was trying to blame my daughter for the accident. The crash left her with a concussion and whiplash. She missed two weeks of school and had to quit her job at the local coffee shop because she couldn't handle the physical demands anymore. But this lawyer was determined to prove she was somehow at fault. During the deposition, he kept asking the same questions over and over, trying to confuse her or get her to contradict herself. My daughter has always been sharp, but head injuries can affect your memory. So I was worried about how she'd handle his aggressive tactics. Lawyer starts with this condescending tone. Now, Miss Johnson, you claim you were completely stopped at the intersection, correct? Yes, sir. The light was red. But how can you be absolutely certain you were stopped? Isn't it possible you were still slowing down? Because my car has something called brakes and I use them. The stenographer smiled, but the lawyer wasn't amused. He kept pushing. You were on your phone at the time of the accident, weren't you? No, I wasn't. Come now, you're a teenager. All teenagers are on their phones constantly. Surely you were texting someone. I wasn't on my phone. I find that Very hard to believe. What teenager isn't on their phone while driving? That's when my daughter looked him dead in the eye and said, the kind whose parents actually taught her how to drive responsible. Maybe if more adults acted like adults instead of getting drunk and driving into teenagers, we wouldn't need to have these conversations. The room went completely silent. The lawyer's face turned red, but he kept go. Let's talk about your alleged injuries. Concussions are very convenient because they're impossible to prove, aren't they? Actually, they showed up on my CT scan. But I'm not a doctor. Are you? I'm asking the questions here, young lady. Right. But you just asked me if concussions are impossible to prove. And I'm telling you mine was proven by medical imaging. So either you don't understand how CT scans work or you're asking questions you already know the answers to just to waste everyone's time. Our lawyer was trying not to smile. The other guy was getting flustered. Miss Johnson, isn't it true that you've been milking these so called injuries for attention and to get out of school? Yes, because nothing says fun teenage experience like massive headaches, memory problems and having to quit the job I loved. I definitely gave myself a concussion just to miss my AP chemistry test. The sarcasm was thick and he and the court reporter was stifling a laugh. But the lawyer wasn't done. He pulled out a photo on his phone. And showed it to her. This is a picture from your Instagram account posted 3 days after the accident. You're smiling. If you were really injured, would you be posting happy photos? My daughter looked at the photo, then back at him with this completely deadpan expression.

I got her dumped. So I moved into this house with my three buddies from college. It was me and three dudes, which was honestly the best living situation I ever had. We split everything evenly, had this jar in the kitchen where we all threw in cash for groceries and beer. And nobody cared if you left dishes in the sink for a day or two. Everything was perfect until my roommate Jay, started dating this girl, Karen. At first she seemed cool. When he brought her to game night, she was all smiles and laughs until she realized I actually lived there and wasn't just someone's girlfriend visiting. The second she found out I had my own room and lived with three guys, her whole vibe changed after that. Karen would show up right when I got off work and stay until Jay left for his night shift job. If I came out to the living room, she'd straight up ask why I was out there. If I went to the kitchen, she'd tell me I was being disrespectful and interrupting their time together. She even complained that me doing my laundry was ruining their mood. Like what? The worst part was when I'd be talking to Jay about normal roommate stuff and she'd literally start making out with him to shut down our conversation. We all started laughing it off because her fake moaning through the walls was honestly embarrassing for Her one morning after she got drunk and I brought her food and Tylenol to help her hangover, she completely lost it. Jay was making breakfast for both of us like he always did when she came downstairs screaming. She woke up our other 2 roommates, accusing Jay of cheating and me of sleeping with all the guys. And she demanded Jay pay her back for the food he was wasting on me. My roommate, Cam, literally grabbed 5 bucks from our grocery jar and slapped it in Jay's hand. Me and Cam told Jay she couldn't come over anymore if she couldn't handle me living there. He asked for a week to figure it out. That's when things got really weird. During that week, money kept disappearing from our grocery jar. My clean dishes would randomly appear dirty in the sink. Random stuff from common areas would show up in my room. Karen was trying to frame me and she sucked at it. Then Cam got a call from his mom asking if I was going through something because someone had sent her pictures and stories about how I.

Mom said, loud enough for everyone to hear. We were at Gary's promotion party, and I already felt sick to my stomach knowing what was coming. Mom announced to her friends, Gary just got promoted to senior analyst. Meanwhile, his little brother still lives at home playing with computers. Her friend shook her head with this fake sadness that made me want to disappear, she said. Such a shame when one child thrives and the other doesn't. My phone buzzed with an urgent text from my assistant about Gary's company offering 90,000 for an emergency fix. I stood up and said, work emergency. Mom laughed bitterly and said, what work? You don't even have a real job. I said, $90,000 worth and walked out. My assistant's text was frantic because Gary's company had six hours before employees missed their paychecks. This was the fourth time this year they'd called my company, but Gary had no clue it was me. I only work their systems at night when Gary was home sleeping, and during the day, I sent my team instead. The invoices just showed a contractor number because I planned it that way. Last week, mom had actually told our extended family not to lend me money because I was a lost cause. She he posted on social media about being proud of Gary while asking for prayers that I'd find direction. The worst part was that Gary had liked the post. And commented that maybe I should learn a trade since college was clearly wasted on me. His co workers had seen it and laughed. About now those same people were begging my company to rescue them. I arrived at midnight with only five hours to fix everything before the company collapsed. Gary's boss was there, pacing around with tears in his eyes. But Gary had gone home hours earlier claiming the stress was giving him migraines, which was typical. His boss said, thank god you're here. If you can't fix this, we're finished. The system was completely destroyed because someone had tried to update during payroll processing and corrupted everything. My heart was racing knowing what was at stake. First hour went by and I found the corruption, but it was worse than I thought. Second hour, I kept trying data recovery, but it kept failing and my hands started shaking. Third hour, I finally got some traction, but time was running out fast. At 4:00am, executive started arriving in panic mode, including Gary, who looked annoyed at being called in. Gary demanded, who called this contractor? His boss said, same one who always fixes our disasters. Gary watched from across the room and muttered to his coworker that at least contractors were good for something, which made my blood boil. By 5:00am, with 15 minutes before deadline, I got everything running perfectly. Gary's

By morning, 31 missed calls and one message made me laugh. I was halfway through unpacking Christmas decorations. Dad swirled his wine and said flatly, you're not invited to Christmas this year. The room froze. Rachel smirked from the couch, clearly waiting for this moment. Mom gave me that pitying look she uses when she wants me silent. What? I asked. Sure I'd misheard? You heard me, dad said, swirling his glass again. It'll be family, only less stressful without you. Rachel chimed in, smug. Don't make a scene, Travis. Dad just wants peace and quiet, mom added softly. Maybe it's for the best, dear. We want harmony this year. My chest burned. I set the box down, nodded once, and walked out without a word. They thought I'd sulk, beginning cry. But as I left, I remembered something very important. The eight thousand dollar chalet reservation. The one booked under my name with my card. The one dad bragged about like it was his. At home, I sat at my laptop, pulled up the confirmation, and clicked cancel. Full refund. Eight thousand dollars slid neatly back into my account. They erased me from Christmas, so I erased Christmas from them. By morning, my phone lit up with thirty one missed calls and a dozen voicemails. The first was dad tense Travis, there's been a Mistake. The chalet isn't showing up on my account. Call them. Fix it. The second angrier. This isn't funny. Undo it immediately. The last furious. You've embarrassed me, Travis. Fix this now. Embarrassed him? That was his wound. Not cutting me out, not Rachel bragging online. Just his image. By noon, Rachel texted, are you seriously doing this? All my friends know about the chalet. You're ruining Christmas for me. I didn't reply. Silence was louder. That evening, mom appeared at my apartment with a casserole, putting herself in with a spare key I didn't know she still had. Travis, she said sweetly, I think we got off on the wrong foot. Your father didn't mean you weren't invited. Of course you are. If you fix this chalet mess, his reputation's on the line. And if I don't? I asked. Her smile thinned. Then you'll make things very difficult for this family. Do you want to ruin Christmas for your sister? Always, Rachel. I walked her to the door without another word. Two nights later, dad came over himself. This time, not angry. Charming. Fake. He stood in my kitchen, pressed coat, bottle of wine. Listen, he said smoothly, about

I always trusted my husband Dylan completely, but after our second baby was born, everything changed. He started staying out late three nights a week, stopped letting me see his phone, and got super quiet during dinner. I'm not usually the jealous type, but something felt really off about the whole thing. One night, I smelled perfume on his collar and my stomach just dropped. Dylan would tell me he was going to the gym, but when I checked his workout clothes later, they looked barely used, like he hadn't even broken a sweat. I kept telling myself I was being paranoid, but the feeling wouldn't go away. So last Wednesday, I asked my sister Emma to watch the kids and decided to follow him. I stayed a few cars behind the whole time, my hands literally shaking on the steering wheel. I was expecting him to pull up to some woman's house or a hotel or something. Instead, he parked outside this random strip mall and walked into the grocery store. I sat in my car for like an hour, completely confused. Who goes to the grocery store for a secret affair? Finally, I got out and followed him inside. He wasn't shopping for normal stuff, though. He was standing in the baby formula aisle looking totally lost and overwhelmed. Then he pulled out this handwritten list and started grabbing items. Diapers, baby wipes, formula, tiny socks. Everything for A Newborn. I watched him from behind a display of cereal, trying to figure out what was happening. He paid in cash, which was weird, because we always use our card for groceries. But here's where it gets crazy. Instead of leaving through the main exit, he went out the side door. So I followed him again. Outside, there was this woman sitting on a bench with a stroller. She looked exhausted, like she hadn't slept in weeks. Dylan walked up to her, handed over all the bags, and gave her this gentle hug. Then he leaned down and whispered something to the baby in the stroller. My heart literally stopped. This woman wasn't anyone I recognized, and that definitely wasn't our baby. I felt like I couldn't breathe. All those late nights, the secrecy, buying baby stuff with cash. It all made sense now, but not in the way I expected. I didn't confront him that night. I went home and pretended everything was normal. But I barely slept. The next morning, after he left for work, I called him and told him exactly what I saw. No accusations, just the facts.

So I changed my plans. Mom called, where are you? I laughed and advised not to wait. I'm 27 and make good money. But my family treats me like their personal childcare service. Every Saturday for months, my sister Maria would show up at 9:00am with her two kids, say the kids are excited to spend the day with their favorite aunt and disappear until eight PM for date nights. When I tried talking to Maria about a schedule, she got defensive. You don't have kids or a husband, so what else are you doing on Saturdays? When I brought it up to my parents, they sided with her. You're single. You don't have responsibilities like she does. My mother said taking care of Tommy and Sophia is the best preparation you could ask for. Three weeks before Christmas, my mother called asking me to handle catering. About 25 people total. Doing so well at your job and the rest of us are struggling financially. I agreed to pay the $2,000 because it was family. But the week before Christmas, everything changed. I stopped by my parents house when the restaurant called about a menu substitution. I was about to announce myself when I heard my mother on the phone. Oh, Linda, Camilla will be perfect for watching all the kids. We're going to set up the back bedroom upstairs and Camilla can stay up there with all nine children while we adults enjoy Christmas downstairs. My heart started racing. It's absolutely perfect. She continued laughing. Camilla doesn't have kids of her own, so she's not exhausted like us parents. We'll just stick all 9 kids upstairs with Camilla and have a real adult Christmas Celebration with good wine and actual conversations. Backed toward the door quietly, they had planned this elaborate setup. I would pay nearly $2,000 for food and spend the entire holiday babysitting nine kids while everyone else celebrated downstairs. That night, I called the restaurant and canceled the entire catering order. Then I remembered my college friend Jessica had invited me to her family's mountain cabin in Colorado. December 24th arrived. I was at the cabin skiing when my phone started buzzing. Camilla, where are you?

I applauded provider power. Then I withdrew my contributions to rent, childcare, her parents support and vacation fund when her providing couldn't provide for her own expenses. I provide for this family now, my money, my rules, she declared, setting down her fork with the confidence of someone who just solved world hunger. Her mother nodded approvingly. I simply started clapping. Congratulations on your provider power, I said with a smile that probably looked genuine to everyone else. She beamed like I just crowned her queen of the universe. What she didn't realize was that I've been keeping mental notes on our family finances for years. When we got married, we agreed on a partnership. She handled mortgage and groceries. I covered our old rent shortfall, childcare for our twin daughters, monthly support to her parents vacation fund, utilities and about a dozen other expenses. But her new philosophy was clear. The person who provides gets to make the rules. Perfect. I was about to give her exactly what she'd asked for. Over the next few days, she started implementing her new system. New couch without asking, expensive spa trips, premium gym membership. I thought we should discuss these things I mentioned discussion implies we're equals in this decision. We're not anymore. I provide, I decide. She genuinely believed earning more money gave her the right to treat me like a junior partner in my own marriage. But I hadn't forgotten the exact $2,700 I contributed monthly to keep her little kingdom running. The beautiful thing about her new philosophy was that it worked both ways. If the person who provides gets to make the rules, then the person who stops providing should step back from those responsibilities entirely. Sunday afternoon, while she was at her spa day, I opened my banking app and started canceling auto pay authorizations, the daycare payment, the rent contribution, her parents monthly support. I transferred everything to a separate account. She wanted to be the sole provider. Time to find out exactly how much providing she was prepared to handle. The first test came one week later. Her phone buzzed with a text from our old landlord. He says we're short $800 on this month's payment. Did you forget to transfer the money? I just didn't transfer it. Why not? Because you're the provider now. You handle the family expenses. Remember? That's not what I meant. You want to be the provider for fun expenses, but not the boring ones. She couldn't answer without admitting her whole speech was just about getting her way on shopping decisions. The second week brought a call from daycare. Our payment had bounced. You didn't pay for daycare, she said, staring at me in shock. Providers should handle their own family expenses, right? Her face went through confusion, anger and panic as she calculated whether she could cover one $200 on top of everything else. Wednesday, Brought her father calling about the support payment. Your mother's worried about the electric Bill. By the weekend, she was at the kitchen table with her laptop and calculator. Bills spread everywhere like a financial crime scene. I need help with the math, she admitted.

I turned off the stove, set down the spatula and just nodded, I understand, I said calmly. She looked shocked, like she'd been preparing for a fight and I'd just disarmed her completely. That's it. You're not going to argue with me or beg me to stay. Why would I? You just told me exactly how you feel. I respect that. She started crying then, not sad tears, but frustrated ones. Like my reaction wasn't giving her what she needed. Most guys would at least try to fight for me, she said. I'm not most guys. If you're not happy, you should go find what makes you happy. The next morning, I helped her pack. I even carried her boxes to her car. She kept staring at me like I was some puzzle she couldn't solve. Are you seriously not upset about this? She asked. I'm disappointed, but I'm not going to force someone to want me. Two weeks later, she was dating Brad from her Crossfit gym. Classic alpha type, big muscles, loud voice, always posting shirtless photos online. Meanwhile, I started focusing on myself, hit the gym, not to get her back, but because I had extra time. Started reading again, Learned Spanish on an app. Three months later, I got promoted. To manager at work. My boss said my calm leadership style was exactly what the team needed. Never panic under pressure, he said. That's rare. Six months after that, I met Emma at a bookstore. She was buying the same novel I was. We started talking about books, then grabbed coffee. You're really easy to talk to, she said. Most guys just try to impress me or act tough. I Learned that being myself works better than pretending to be someone else. We've been together eight months now. Emma tells her friends I'm the most confident guy she's ever dated. He doesn't need to prove anything to anyone, she told her. That's actually really attractive. Last week, I ran into Ashley at the grocery store. She looked tired, stressed. How are things with Brad, I asked, genuinely curious. Her face fell. We broke up last month. He was too much. Everything was a competition with him, even conversations. He paused, then asked, are you seeing anyone? Yeah, I am. She's great. I made a mistake, didn't I? I thought about it for a second. You made the right choice for who you were. Then we both did. As I walked away, I heard her call out. I never realized how rare it was to find someone who doesn't need to prove they're strong. That night, Emma and I cooked dinner together. The same chicken stir fry I've been making for Ashley that day. You know what I love about you? Emma said while we cleaned up, what's that? You're confident enough to let me be myself. You don't need me to stroke your ego or make you feel like a big man. I kissed her forehead. Real strength doesn't need an audience. The funny thing is Ashley was right about me not being an alpha male, but she was wrong about what that meant. Turns out the woman who is perfect for me didn't want an alpha. She wanted a partner.

You're just the pretty one. So I decided to show them exactly how smart the pretty one could be. Growing up, my parents had us perfectly categorized like we were characters in a sitcom. My brother Ken was the genius who'd become a doctor or lawyer and carry on the family legacy. I was the pretty one who'd marry well, look good at parties and produce beautiful grandchildren. They never expected me to have ambitions beyond finding a rich husband. Don't worry about grades, sweetie, mom would say, while spending hours helping Ken with calculus and chemistry. You'll do fine with your looks. Focus on staying in shape and being charming. Meanwhile, Ken got a tutor, sat prep classes and college counseling. I got makeup tips and reminders to smile more when meeting new people. When I announced I'd gotten accepted to premed with a 3.8 GPA, Dad actually laughed out loud. Honey, medical school is for people like Ken. You should focus on something more realistic, maybe communications or art history, something that plays to your strengths. What exactly are my strengths, I asked. Well, you're beautiful, social, great with people. You'd make an excellent wife to a successful man. I smiled sweetly and said, you're probably right. I'll think about it. But I didn't switch majors. If anything, their dismissal fueled my determination. I, I worked twice as hard as everyone else, knowing I had to prove I Belonged there. I studied while Ken partied, sacrificed social events while he coasted on his natural intelligence. The contrast became obvious by sophomore year. While Ken was barely maintaining a 2.8 GPA in his easy business degree, I was pulling 3.9 s in organic chemistry and molecular biology. When he failed calculus twice, I was acing advanced statistics. But at family dinners, the narrative never changed. How's Ken's internship search going? Ken's professors say he has real potential. Meanwhile, my academic achievements.

My parents eliminated all physical contact from my life when I was 8 because they said human touch was making children weak and dependent, and they wanted to create the world's first truly self sufficient child. My parents were behavioral psychologists who blame society's problems on excessive physical affection. Dad had published papers about how hugging created emotional weakness. Mom studied isolated children in Romanian orphanages and decided they were more resilient than touch children. They'd make me watch documentaries about feral children while explaining how strong these kids were without human contact. I once reached for my mom's hand during a scary movie, and he jerked away like I burned her. Touch is a crutch, she said. You're already too dependent. When I was 8, my parents announced their revolutionary child rearing experiment. No more hugs, hand holding, hair ruffling, or physical contact of any kind. They wore gloves around me to avoid accidental touches. We're giving you the gift of complete self reliance, mom explained from across the room. You'll thank us when you're the strongest person alive. They installed cameras to ensure no one was weakening me with affection. If a teacher patted my shoulder or a relative tried to hug me, they'd file complaints. The isolation was immediate agony. Humans need touch like they need food, but my parents treated it like poison. They'd stand three feet away during conversations. They modified our house so they Could care for me without contact, using tongs to hand me things, and automated systems for everything possible. When I cried, they'd observe from the doorway, taking notes about my withdrawal symptoms. First, I use school as an escape, high fiving and hugging my friends whenever I could. But my parents would have stopped to that quickly and pulled me out for homeschooling. I started deliberately falling just to feel the ground hit my body, craving any physical sensation. My parents were delighted by my self soothing behaviors. I tried different ways to get touch. If my parents let me go to the store, I would bump into people accidentally stand too close in lines, anything for brief contact. But my parents always found out. They started dressing me in clothes with no touching contagious condition written on them. They told everyone I had a skin condition that may touch, painful for me and hazardous for them. People would jump back if they accidentally brushed against me, apologizing while I wanted to scream. By age 10, I developed visible problems. I rocked constantly, hit myself for stimulation, and pulled out hair just to feel something. The breaking point came when I got seriously sick with food poisoning. I was hospitalized, delirious with fever, and the nurses needed to physically examine me. My parents tried to stop them, but I was too sick for their insanity. When the nurse checked my lymph nodes, the gentle pressure of her fingers on my Neck made me sob so hard they had to sedate me. I hadn't felt human touch in five years. The nurses reported my extreme touch starvation to social services. But my parents had anticipated this. They've been building a legal case about their right to raise a contact free child. Complete with forged research and hired experts. They convinced the judge this was legitimate science, not abuse. With their credentials, it was actually believable, and the case was dismissed. After that, they escalated. They built a completely touch proof environment with padded walls I couldn't feel through thick clothing and floors that were always either too hot or too cold to touch comfortably. They were erasing every possible source of physical sensation. You're so close to breakthrough, dad observed from behind glass. Soon you won't even remember wanting touch. He was right. By 13, I was forgetting what hugs felt like. The memory of my mother's hand in mine was so distant, it felt like a dream. I'd watch videos of people embracing and feel nothing but confusion. My parents celebrated this as success, documenting my evolution beyond physical needs. But then one of their colleagues visited to observe me. Doctor Mills was supposed to validate their experiment. But when she saw me, her face changed. She insisted on conducting a private interview. My parents reluctantly agreed, watching through cameras. But Doctor Mills did something unexpected. She turned off her microphone, pulled out a pen and wrote on her notepad. I'm going to help you. She conducted a normal interview out loud while

I was teaching a high school biology class about genetics, a topic I personally love. It was a regular day and we'd reached the part about dominant and recessive traits. I decided to use eye color as a relatable example, explaining carefully that brown eyes are genetically dominant over blue eyes. I thought it was pretty clear and most students were nodding along. Then Jake raised his hand looking genuinely curious. He asked, totally serious, so does that mean people with brown eyes are better than people with blue eyes? I laughed softly, thinking he was just messing with me and responded lightly, no, dominant just means that the trait masks the recessive one. It has nothing to do with being better. The class moved on without further confusion, or so I thought. The next morning, the principal called me into his office. First thing, I was surprised because I hadn't had any issues recently. When I walked in, Jake's parents were already there, visibly upset and staring daggers into me. The dad looked especially irritated, arms crossed, and the mom just looked ready to explode. Before I could even ask what was going on, Jake's mom burst out, how dare, how dare you tell our child that brown eyed people are superior and should dominate blue eyed people? The dad quickly jumped in with, we know exactly what dominant means, spreading some kind of eye color discrimination in class. I Stood there shocked, utterly bewildered at how quickly everything had escalated. My heart was pounding and I could feel the heat rising to my face as I scrambled to calmly clarify, that's absolutely not what I said or meant. Dominant and recessive are strictly genetic terms about which traits appear, not about superiority or inferiority. But they weren't buying it. The dad was persistent, shaking his head and repeating, we know what dominant means. You can't fool us. The mom chimed in passionately insisting, I owed them and Jake an apology for promoting what she termed eye color supremacy. I was starting to feel genuinely panicked, not sure how to resolve this bizarre misunderstanding. Thankfully, the principal, calm and composed as always, stepped in. He pulled up the official curriculum guide right there on his computer screen. Here, let me show you exactly what's being taught, he said firmly. He patiently walked them through the entire genetic section, carefully explaining every detail and even got up to draw a quick Punnett square on the whiteboard. He pointed at the squares clearly illustrating how dominant and recessive genes.

Later, this same unfriendly roommate started putting his arm around me. Never other guys got close, saying, back off, he's already taken. After someone found out from my computer, I decided to just be open about it to everyone in the dorm. My closest roommate, Ryan, immediately jumped up and ran to the balcony to wash his hands. I felt awful inside, but I forced a laugh. Seriously, it's not like anything's contagious. Face went cold. Who knows what you've got? I couldn't even speak. My bust tightened as I slammed the door behind me. When I got back after class, Ryan had switched beds. He used to sleep near me, but now moved as far away as possible. My stuff was shoved to one corner and the whole place reeked of disinfectant. This guy who never even washed his socks was suddenly obsessed with cleaning. Impressive performance. I rolled my eyes, shut my bed curtain and decided to ignore it all. In the middle of the night, just as I was dozing off, I felt someone pressing against my back. I turned around and nearly yelled. Ryan's face was right there, way too close, but his eyes were shut. Was he sleepwalking? Never seen it happen before. Why now? Ryan's warm bust moved Closer.

Everyone's eyes turned to me at once because this cat had been sound asleep in my camera frame just one minute ago. As I was about to explain, my boss patted the cat's butt and said, good kitty. Go find Mommy. Just kill me now. I ended up living with my boss, Ryan Miller, completely by accident. I was just a junior assistant in his company's project apartment who had recently passed my probation period. The kind whose name he wouldn't even bother remembering. But I had a side job, pet sitting, more professionally called a pet care specialist. One ordinary weekend, I accepted a job through the app and arrived at the clients home with my toolbox. I had just finished bathing the cat when I heard the door open behind me. I turned around to find myself face to face with Ryan, who had just returned from a business trip. In that moment, might as well have turned to stone. How could I possibly have ended up pet sitting at my boss's house? I tried to act calm, telling myself he couldn't possibly recognize me, let alone remember who I was. I kept my head down, pretend to be busy blow drying the cat. When the hair dryer stopped, Ryan walked to my side. He had changed into comfortable lounge wear. Backlit by the window, his silhouette looked ridiculously handsome from my angle. But this wasn't The time to be swooning. I quickly turned my head, using my hair as a shield to hide my face. He only asked, was it you the previous times, too? I nodded silently. After nodding, I silently cursed myself. How could I have come here so many times without realizing it was my boss's place? Good job. He evaluated briefly, then offered, would you be interested in a long term arrangement? Huh? This cat is difficult to handle. Unless. He paused for a moment, then continued actually, I need someone to take care of it long term, preferably living here. Name your price. Are you willing? I was in a daze. Live in housekeeper? He chuckled mysteriously. If that's how you want to see it, sure. I hesitated, speaking softly. But I have a job. I know you have a job, he stated calmly. Aren't you Thomas's assistant from the project department? I remember you, Olivia. I literally jolted. The impact of him accurately calling my name felt like Mars crashing into earth. I was completely stunned, and he continued you can go to work at the company during the day and stay here at night to help take care of it. It won't interfere with anything. But. But. I was still searching for excuse. Ryan suddenly mentioned meaningfully, if I recall correctly, the company explicitly prohibits employees from taking side jobs. Right. That brought me back to reality. The reason I feared running into my boss while working my Side job was precisely because I was afraid of losing this valuable position that I had just secured after my internship. Half threatening, half coaxing, he said, stay and take care of the cat, and I'll overlook this. With no choice, I nodded. And that's how I began living with Ryan Miller. Or rather, with his cat. His cat's name is Chestnut. According to Ryan, Chestnut has a proud temperament, doesn't like people, meows at night, and loves to scratch. His voice got particularly heavy on

What happened afterwards with your life? I've been dating Sophia for four years when I finally decided to ask the big question. Her parents treated me like their own son, especially after they found out I grew up in foster care. Her little brother would literally follow me around their house, begging me to teach him how to fix engines. Someone who never had a real family, being part of theirs felt like everything I've been missing my whole life. I've been saving every extra dollar from my job at Murphy's Auto Shop for months. The ring wasn't fancy, just a simple band with a small diamond, but it was real and it was all I could afford. I planned everything perfectly. Sophia's dad was turning 60 and they were throwing this big backyard BBQ. All her family would be there, plus her closest friends. She always said family was the most important thing to her. So I figured proposing surrounded by everyone who loved us both would be perfect. The party was going great. Sophia's mom made her famous brisket. Her dad was telling embarrassing stories about Sophia as a kid. And everyone was laughing and having a good time. After they brought out the birthday cake and saying happy birthday, I figured it was the perfect moment. My hands were shaking as I tapped my beer bottle with a fork to get everyone's attention. The whole backyard went dead silent. Sophia Looked confused at first, then her eyes went wide. When I got down on one knee and pulled out the ring box, her mom gasped and started tearing up. Her dad had this huge smile on his face. Her friends were already pulling out their phones to record the moment. I opened the box and said all the things I've been practicing in my head for weeks, how much I loved her, how she changed my life, how I wanted to spend forever making her happy. The words just poured out of me. But Sophia just stood there frozen. Not good. Frozen like she was overwhelmed with happiness. Add frozen like she'd seen a ghost. Liam, she finally said, and I could hear the panic in her voice, I love you so much, but I'm not ready for this. I'm so sorry. The silence that followed was the worst sound I'd ever heard. 30 people just staring at us, not knowing what to do or where to look. I stayed on one knee for probably five seconds too long, trying to process what had just happened. And I slowly stood up, shoved the ring box back in my pocket and nodded. Okay, I said, because what else could I say? Sophia reached for my arm, but I stepped back. I couldn't deal with her trying to comfort me in front of everyone. I mumbled something about needing to go and walked straight to my truck. The drive home was the Longest 20 minutes of my life. I stayed up all night staring at the ceiling, replaying every conversation we'd ever had about the future. We talked about getting married, about kids, about buying a house together. How had I read everything so wrong? The next day I was under the hood of a broken down Chevy trying to lose myself in work when I heard footsteps approaching. I looked up expecting to see my boss, but it was.

At 9 years old, I realised my parents loved my little sister more than me. That Christmas, all the gifts were wrapped in beautiful colours, sparkles and ribbons with tags written in cursive by my parents. But when I looked at the last gift, I realised every single gift was for me. Where's Lily's gifts, I asked. My parents pointed to a big black bin bag. Lily started to sniffle and tried holding back her tears. Inside there was an envelope neatly folded with instructions on how she needed to improve her grades. Well, 9 year old me wasn't having it. Mommy, this isn't fair. Lily deserves a real gift. Shut the f up. She cut me off. Meanwhile, my dad started yelling at the top of his voice, don't tell me how I should raise my kids. But as soon as they weren't looking, I hugged her and we spent the entire morning secretly playing with my new toys together. This set the tone for the rest of our childhood. To my parents, Lily was the definition of a disappointment. So even when she did things like forget to do her chores or accidentally sleep in on the weekend, they never let it slide. My dad would either force us all to completely ignore her for 48 hours straight or she'd only be given dry toast to eat for the whole week. All rules which I, of course, broke when They weren't looking. So when she turned 15 and got a boyfriend, I didn't tell anyone because I was the only one she trusted and there was no way I was breaking that. But one night she came to my door crying her eyes out and that's when she took out an easy at home pregnancy with double lines. My mind jumped into problem solving mode. I told her we could live with our aunt for a while, that I tell my parents I was the one who was pregnant. I knew she didn't understand what my plan was, but I didn't care because she was safe and that's all that mattered. She slept in my bed and the next morning I woke my parents up pinching myself to fake cry, Mom, Dad, I'm pregnant. My dad looked like he wanted to lay hands on me, but then looked at my stomach and decided against it. I effing told you Lily would be a bad influence on her was the first thing my mom said. We'll be out of your hair in a few hours. We're gonna stay with Auntie Lisa until damn right you are, my dad said. I retreated to the bedroom and me and Lily tried to pack up our things as fast as we could before ordering an Uber in the car. When Lily cried, I noticed barcode marks all along her wrist. My chest tightened but I just stayed silent, not saying anything. Unfortunately, I Couldn't get her to stop crying by the time we arrived and we were forced to tell Aunt Lisa everything. Instead of screaming at us or telling our parents, she gave us a hug, told us she understood, that she knew our parents were crazy and that it was only a matter of time before we turned to her for help. I smiled, and in that moment, I knew I had done good for my sister. In the next two weeks, Lily had a successful baby, unalive, and Auntie Lisa managed to convince our parents to let us come home. That's when something I never expected to happen happened. Lily was the new golden child. The entire wall of photos that used to feature our family was now filled with pictures of Lily that I had never even seen before. And for dinner, I was the one getting the borderline expired food no one wanted while Lily got freshly cooked meals. Honestly, the whole thing made me smile all I wanted was for Lily to experience some sort of loving family, even if it was at my expense. But Lily betrayed me. Whenever they were talking about how filthy and unpure I was for getting pregnant, she'd join in.

My dad's side has this brutal initiation ritual where every guy at 16 has to survive three days alone in Alaska's wilderness. My son turned 16 last month and when I refused to continue this tradition, my entire family disowned us. Growing up, I watched this ritual destroy lives. My cousin Tommy froze two fingers off during his initiation. My brother Nathan got hypothermia so bad he still has breathing problems. But everyone just called it building character. The women weren't allowed to interfere. They just had to watch their sons disappear into the woods and pray they came back. My dad made me do it when I turned 16. Three days in the Alaskan wilderness in February with just a knife, some matches and a sleeping bag. No food, no tent, no first aid kit. I nearly died when I fell through some ice. The only reason I survived was because an off duty park ranger found me and secretly helped me build a shelter. My family still brags about how I conquered nature alone. When my wife Grace was pregnant with our son Oliver, I swore I'd never put him through that. Grace supported my decision, but my family just laughed it off. You'll understand when he's older. They said it's what makes our men strong. As Oliver grew up, my dad would tell him stories about the initiation, making it sound like some grand adventure. He'd Show Oliver the scars on his hands from his own trial, calling them badges of honor. Every family gathering, someone would ask Oliver if he was excited for his turn. The kids started having nightmares about freezing to death. Last month, two weeks before Oliver's 16th birthday, my dad showed up with the traditional initiation gear, the same knife and sleeping bag that's been passed down for generations. Oliver looked terrified. When I said we weren't doing it, my dad thought I was joking. Don't be ridiculous, he said. Every Russell man has done this since your great grandfather's time. You can't break tradition. I told him times had changed. We didn't need to risk our children's lives to prove they were men. That's when things got ugly. My dad called Grace a weak city girl who had ruined his grandson. He said Oliver would grow up soft and useless. My brother Nathan, who still has lung damage from his initiation, backed my dad up, said I was spitting on our heritage. I lost it. I pulled up the medical records from Tommy's finger amputations, Nathan's hospital stays in my own near death experience, showed them the thousands in medical bills our family had paid just to maintain this dangerous tradition. Dad knocked the paper.

When my daughter was an infant, we were sleeping one Saturday morning, both recovering from colds. In my half asleep state, I thought I smelled something burning. It was sharp, acrid and unmistakably the scent of plastic and chemicals. The smell was so overpowering it woke me up coughing. The room was hazy. I wasn't dreaming. The smell filled the air and panic hit me. Grabbing my baby, I bolted out of bed barefoot and in a nightgown. I ran through the house thinking maybe an electrical outlet was sparking. But when I reached the kitchen, I saw flames glowing orange through the porch doorway. I couldn't exit that way, so I ran back through the house, escaping out another door while calling 9, 1 1. Standing on the street, shivering in the early March cold, I held my baby tightly in her blanket, grateful we were safe but terrified of what could have happened. When the fire department arrived, they moved us further down the street after discovering propane tanks and gallons of commercial cleaning chemicals stored in an outdoor closet by the flames. If they did nighted later, the fire chief and a police officer asked if anyone had a vendetta against me. I was confused until they explained it was arson. Fires have been set in three separate locations on the property, ensuring there was no way I'd survive. Evidence was sent to the a crime lab, but none of the Fingerprints matched anyone in the system. I've never had closure. That smell still haunts me even years later. Just as I'm drifting off to sleep, I sometimes catch a phantom whiff of burning plastic. It snaps me awake, my senses on high alert, instantly transporting me back to that terrifying day.

I was getting my nails done for my engagement photos the next day. Nothing too crazy, just some almond shaped acrylics with a simple pink and white design. The nail tech, Anna, was putting on the final coat when my phone buzzed. It was a text from my fiance, Kevin, can you please get normal nails? Those long fake ones look so trashy. My mom's gonna be in the photos, and she already thinks you're not classy enough for our family. Just keep it simple so you don't embarrass me. I stared at my phone for, like, 10 seconds. The whole salon was buzzing with chatter and music, but I felt like everything just stopped. Anna noticed me freeze up and asked if everything was okay. I didn't know what to say, so I just showed her the text. She read it, and her face went from confused to angry real quick. Then she did something I wasn't expecting. She turned to the other nail techs and said loudly, hey, girls, look at this! Within seconds, I had, like, six women huddled around my chair, all reading Kevin's message over each other's shoulders. The salon went dead silent. Even the music seemed quieter. One of the older ladies getting a pedicure leaned over and asked what was wrong. Anna just held up my phone and read the text out. Loud to the entire salon. Can you please get normal nails? Those long fake ones look so trashy. I've never heard a room full of women get so mad so fast. This lady named Carmen, who is getting her eyebrows done, started going off about how no man should ever talk to his woman like that. The girl next to me was like, honey, those nails are gorgeous. There's nothing trashy about them. Even the receptionist came over from the front desk. But then Anna did something that changed everything. She looked at me and said, you know what? We're gonna make these nails even better. Before I could say anything, she started adding tiny diamonds to each nail. Then she called over her coworker Maria, who started painting these intricate little roses on my ring finger. The whole salon turned into, like, a mission. Carmen offered to pay for the extra designs. Pedicure lady started giving me advice about red flags in relationships. This teenager getting her nails done for prom said she wished her boyfriend supported her choices. Like that, everyone was just rallying around me, and I spent an extra hour making my nails absolutely perfect. When she was done, they looked like something you'd see on Instagram. Long, elegant, with the most beautiful, detailed artwork I'd ever seen on nails. She refused to let me pay the extra charge for all the upgrades. I took a picture and sent it to Kevin with the message, the Salon thinks you're wrong. These look amazing. He immediately called me furious, saying I was being dramatic and that I made him look bad by showing strangers our private conversation. I told him

When her sister asked about our wedding, she said that's Plan B. Austin's Plan a, if he gets his get together. They laughed. I just listened from the hallway. The next morning, she woke up to an empty venue. My fiance, Joyce and I had been together for three years, engaged for 18 months. The problem was Austin, her ex, who'd become her best friend. For the first year, I tried to be the understanding boyfriend. But after we got engaged, her commitment shrank. While her options stayed open was the constant lunch dates she called, catching up, the way she'd mention what Austin thought about our wedding choices, the way her phone lit up with his name during our date nights. The moment I knew something was really wrong was three months ago, she asked me to fix her laptop while she was at the gym. The password was still Austin's birthday, which should have been my first red flag. When I opened it to install updates, I saw a folder on the desktop called wedding plans. I figured it was our wedding stuff. I click it. Inside were two folders with names on them. One said Walter, that's me. The other said Austin. I clicked on Austin's folder first. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. She had planned an entire wedding with Austin. Their make Believe wedding was on the same date as ours with the same guest list, same color scheme, even the same photographer. To her credit, the venue was different for both of us. She was literally planning two weddings for the same day. She put down a deposit. Six weeks after accepting my proposal, the wedding planner had written back, how exciting that you're keeping both options open. We'll be ready for whichever groom you choose. Then I found something worse, a spreadsheet comparing me and Austin like we were cars she was thinking about buying. She'd rated us in 30 different categories. Austin won on excitement, chemistry and future potential. I won on stability, reliability and parental approval. At the bottom, she'd written decide morning of she was actually planning to wake up on our wedding day and pick which man to marry. I took photos of everything with my phone. Then I got to work. Since I was paying for everything, all the vendors had my name on the accounts. I called every single one and told them we had a family emergency and needed to cancel. I got every deposit back, $47,000 total went straight into my personal bank account. Then I did something clever. I created a fake email address that looked like it came from our wedding planner. I sent Joyce confirmation email saying everything was perfect and ready to go. She never suspected anything. As for me, I booked myself a first class ticket to Pan for the morning of the wedding. Our wedding day arrived and I woke up at 5 a. M, kissed her forehead while she slept, grabbed my packed bags and drove to the airport. She texted me at seven.

I sent receipts, screenshots of Luke calling me worthless, photos of the bruises and scratches, photos of the holes he punched in our walls. Amira responded first, these could be from anyone. Then Ella. Maybe you shouldn't have pissed him off. Luke showed us your texts. 2 you sound crazy. They chose to believe the man who'd isolated me for three years over the girl who'd friendship bracelet them in second grade. Two weeks later, Lorelai's bachelorette party photos flooded my feed. There was Luke. My Luke. Shirtless, bartending at their Vegas suite. All six of my former friends draped over him like he was some celebrity. The comments twisted the knife. Me when I leave my toxic relationship. He seems so much happier now. This is what healthy looks like. They'd replaced me with him. The man who destroyed it was now their new favourite person. Weeks later, it got worse. They specifically re added me to their close friends just to make sure I'd see everything. They posted drunk videos of them licking whipped cream off his ABS, Ella making out with him in a club, and Amira grinding on him while the others cheered. 20 years of friendship and they were taking turns with my abuser. Meanwhile, rock bottom tasted like microwave ramen eaten standing over the sink at 2:00am. After days of bed rotting and bawling my eyes out, my elderly neighbour Rosie Lynn knocked. Miha, these walls are thin. I've been listening to your pain. She brought me to her church that Sunday. I started volunteering at the animal shelter. No big breakthrough moment, just slowly climbing out of hell, one day at a time. While my ex friends posted wine drunk selfies with Luke front and center, calling themselves ride or dies, I was learning to love life again through rescue dogs and Sunday worship. A year and a half later, a close friend from church left me their 40 acre animal sanctuary. Within six months, I'd created programs for at risk youth using rescue animals for therapy. I built real friendships with volunteers. James, a contractor from the congregation, volunteered to fix the barn. We fell in love over rescued horses and broken fence posts. His kids from his first marriage started calling me mom without anyone asking them to. Our wedding was small, intimate, perfect. Meanwhile, updates trickled through mutual acquaintances. My old friend group turned into a self inflicted nightmare. Lorelai had cheated with Luke at her own wedding. Her new husband found them in the bridal suite. Then he moved through the group, dating Ella, then Amira, causing non stop drama everywhere. Each one thought she'd be The one to fix him. People in the neighborhood thought they were in some weird, toxic polyamorous relationship. Now they were all fighting over who betrayed who, posting cryptic quotes about fake friends and karma.

I built our marketing department from absolutely nothing. Six years ago when I started at this company, there wasn't even a marketing team, just me in a corner cubicle trying to figure out social media campaigns, email marketing by myself. After my first year, my boss approached me, we want to expand marketing. You interested in building a department? Of course I said yes. For two years, I was a one person army, creating strap strategies, running campaigns, analyzing data, everything. My numbers were so good that my manager actually asked the boss to give me a bonus. Then the company grew and they finally gave me a team. Three new hires that I personally trained from day one. I taught them our systems, our client preferences, our campaign strategies, basically everything I'd Learned through trial and error over four years. But here's the kicker, my title never changed. Still marketing agent after all this time. I brought this up to my manager multiple times. We'll see what we can do was always the response. Then came the meeting that changed everything. My manager calls me in and says, the boss thinks we need an official team lead position. I'm thinking finally recognition for what I've been doing all along. Who do you think it'll be? I asked already knowing the answer. Well, you started the department, you trained Everyone, you have the most experience. I walked out of that meeting on cloud 9. Six years of hard work was finally paying off. Two weeks later, another meeting. We've decided to hire externally for the team lead position. I swear my heart stopped internally, but I've been doing the job for years. The boss just couldn't see you in that leadership role. Those words hit like a punch to the gut. Couldn't see me in leadership. I've been leading this team since before it existed. I've been making all the strategic decisions, training new hires, managing client relationships. What exactly did leadership look like to them? They hired someone with zero experience at our company, zero understanding of our processes, our clients, our culture. And the best part, they assigned me to train them. I spent three weeks teaching my replacement everything I knew. Well, not everything. I'm not stupid. I taught them enough to do the basic job, but the deep for strategies and client insights that stays with me. The breaking point came when we hired another new person. The team lead was on vacation. So guess who got stuck training them? Me again. During training, I mentioned how I'd started the department. This new hire who'd been there exactly one month looked at me with this pitying expression and said, so all that just to not be team lead? That look, that tone?

I found out when my Uncle Jimmy showed up at my door at 2:00am, covered in blood. I hadn't seen him in three years. Last time was at Grandma's funeral, when he asked everyone for money. Mom said he was living under the bridge downtown. Dad said he chose that life. Everyone said to stay away from him. But there he was, bleeding on my porch, begging me not to call anyone. Just need bandages and water. Please don't tell your mom I'm here. I let him in. His face was swollen, three teeth missing, blood dripping from a gash above his eye. I grabbed the first aid kit while he collapsed on my couch. Who did this to you? I asked, painting the wound. He winced. Doesn't matter. Can I stay here tonight? Just tonight. My phone buzzed. Mom texting at 2:00am. Is Jimmy there? Don't let him in. Call police immediately. How did she even know I looked at Jimmy? She's tracking you somehow. He laughed bitterly. They all are. Your dad, your aunt, everyone. They pay people to watch me. That made no sense. Why would they pay people to watch a homeless man? Jimmy pulled out a crumpled envelope from his jacket. Legal documents covered in dried blood. I recognized the law firm immediately. Henderson and Associates. Same firm that handled Grandma's estate. Your grandmother left me everything, he said quietly. The house, the money, All of it? $2 million. I stared at him. That's impossible. Mom said. Grandma left everything to charity. Jimmy shook his head. She left it to me because I took care of her for 10 years while everyone else was too busy. Fed her, bathed her, gave her medication. Your parents visited maybe twice a year. Then why are you homeless? Pointed to a clause in the document. The money only becomes mine if I can prove I'm mentally competent and drug free for five consecutive years. If I fail, it goes to your parents and aunt. My stomach dropped. They're trying to make you fail. Jimmy nodded. Every time I get clean, something happens. I get jumped. My apartment mysteriously catches fire. Someone plants drugs in my backpack. Last time, I had four years clean. One more year and I would have gotten everything. I grabbed my phone and started recording. Tell me everything. He talked for two hours. Names, dates, place. The private investigator my dad hired to follow him. The dealer my aunt paid to offer him free drugs. The shelter worker my mom bribed to kick him out during winter. Three years ago, I was living in a Halfway House, staying clean, working at a warehouse. Your dad showed up with two men. They destroyed my room, planted needles, got me thrown out. I had to start the five years over. My phone kept recording. Last year, I tried again. Got a job at McDonald's. Saved enough for A studio apartment. Your aunt called my landlord, said I was dangerous. I threatened her kids. Complete lies. Evicted within a week. Why didn't you call the police? With what proof? I'm the family junkie who believes the homeless uncle over successful family members. We need to get you somewhere safe. I said Jimmy stood up too fast. Dizzy from blood loss. That's when we heard the car doors outside. I looked through the blinds. My parents SUV in the driveway. My aunt's Mercedes.

I've been doing physical therapy for six years now and I've seen all kinds of patients. But there was this one guy, Mister Garland, who still keeps me up at night sometimes. He came to me after a massive stroke that left his entire left side paralyzed, 67 years old, quiet as a stone, and absolutely refuse to even try walking again. Not that he couldn't do it. He flat out wouldn't do it. Every session was like pulling teeth. I'd ask him to lift his arm and he'd just stare out the window. I'd suggest we work on his balance and he'd shake his head. I don't see the point, he'd always say in this defeated voice. At first I figured it was depression, which happens a lot with stroke patients. But then I started noticing weird things. Whenever I mentioned his family or asked about visitors, he'd flinch like I'd slapped him. He kept zero personal items in his room, no photos, no cards, nothing. I suggested we do exercises so he could play with his grandkids again and he snapped at me so hard I almost jumped out of my skin. Don't you ever mention them again, he said through gritted teeth. After two months of absolutely zero progress, my supervisor called me into her office. He told me to close his case, said we were wasting time and resources on someone who clearly didn't want to get Better. But something about the whole situation bugged me. So on my day off, I decided to do some digging. I looked up his name online, searched through old news articles, court records, anything I could find. That's when I found the story that explained everything. Five years ago, Mister Garland had been a high school history teacher, 32 years in the classroom, teacher of the year twice, the whole nine yards. Kids loved him. Then one day a 15 year old student named Ashley accused him of making inappropriate comments about her appearance, that he'd called her into his office after class and made her uncomfortable. The school district didn't even wait for an investigation. They fired him immediately. His daughter stopped speaking to him. His neighbors avoided eye contact. Local news picked up the story and ran with it. His entire reputation got destroyed overnight. But here's the kicker. Six months later, Ashley admitted she'd made the whole thing up. She was failing his class and thought if she got him in trouble, maybe the new teacher would give her better grades. School district quietly cleared his record, but by then it was too late. Nobody apologized. Nobody wanted to hire the guy who'd been accused of inappropriate contact with a student. Even though he was proven innocent. His teaching career was over. His family relationships were ruined. He became a pariah in his own town. The next morning I walked into his room with a stack of Printed articles, the original accusation, the investigation results, the student's confession.

Some girls arrive at college ready for a fresh start, but Madison arrived like high school never ended. She lived three doors down and had somehow decided that my late night water runs were her business. Crime. Existing in a tank top without a bra. The verdict? She was about to make it everyone's problem. It started with a knock on my door one Tuesday night. I just walked 10 yards to the water fountain in a white tank top, no bra. Because why would I? The tank was fitted, but not see through. You could maybe see the outline of my nips if you were actively looking. Madison stood there, twisting her rose gold ring, speaking in that fake, concerned voice. Hey, so sorry to ask, but could you maybe put on a bra when you're in the hallway? My boyfriend's visiting, and he was, um, staring a little. I'm non confrontational to a fault, so I actually apologized. Yeah, sure. No problem. For the rest of that night, I threw on a hoodie every time I left my room. Whatever. Pick your battles, right? But the next morning, my roommate came back from the bathroom looking pissed. You'll never guess what I just heard. She. Turns out Madison was in there with her squad doing a full Broadway reenactment of my water fountain trip. According to her version, I've Been practically topless, bending over suggestively, taking my sweet time while her poor boyfriend struggled to keep his virgin eyes off me. She actually demonstrated my supposed poses at the sink, complete with hair flips I definitely didn't do that night. I passed Madison and her friends in the hallway wearing Thomas. No bra again because I've forgotten her stupid request. She looked directly at my chest, whispered something, and they all started giggling like middle schoolers who just discovered Urban Dictionary. But the moment I snapped the email, R R A. Sent a building wide message about appropriate hallway attire and respecting communal spaces. Anonymous complaint, she said. But I knew exactly who'd submitted it. Some passive aggressive bull crap about keeping things covered up for everyone's comfort. Challenge accepted. If Madison was so worried about her boyfriend seeing the vague outline of my nips through a tank top, maybe the real problem wasn't my outfit. I did what any petty genius would do. Search. Took me five minutes to find what I needed. See, Madison's boyfriend Dylan, didn't go to our school. He lived two hours away, went to community college, and worked part time at a vape shop. More importantly, we were in the middle of a pandemic, and our dorm had a strict policy. No non student guests. Signs were everywhere. The rules were crystal clear. Madison had been sneaking him in through the side door, letting him use our bathrooms, and having him sleep over. Multiple nights a week. Everyone knew it, but nobody cared enough to report it. Until now. I filled out the anonymous complaint form, the same one she'd used against me. But I didn't stop at unauthorised guest. I mentioned the mask policy. He never wore one in the hallways. The fact that he'd been using student only facilities. And my personal favourite, that I'd seen him multiple times without proper

My family has this twisted tradition where they humiliate every bride at the rehearsal dinner to test if she'll still marry into the chaos. My grandmother started it after her sister in law was supposedly too delicate for our loud Italian family. My mother had wine thrown in her face by a hired actress pretending to be dad's mistress. My sister in law got served fake divorce papers from my brother's imaginary first wife. They all stayed and passed the test, which apparently proved they were worthy. When I proposed after three years together, I knew what was coming and spent months dreading it. While my mother planned her ambush, I overheard phone calls about hiring the perfect actress and caught glimpses of pregnancy scripts on her laptop. Every time I tried canceling the rehearsal dinner, she'd shut me down. Every marriage in this family starts with truth, even if we have to manufacture it ourselves. Weeks turned into days and suddenly it was 48 hours before our wedding and I still hadn't found my spine. Instead, I did what cowards do and tried playing both sides by warning my fiance something bad would happen at dinner tomorrow. What kind of something bad? I explained the family tradition while watching her face cycle through disbelief and rage before landing on something unreadable. And you're still making me go through with this. I made excuses about Family obligations and how it would be over quickly. So you won't stand up to them, but you expect me to take whatever abuse they've planned. I promised to support her through it, which even I knew sounded pathetic. She stared at me before saying she understood perfectly and would handle everything herself. Tomorrow night, the rehearsal dinner arrived and I sat there watching my mother check her phone every five minutes with barely contained glee while my father kept refilling wine glasses to ensure maximum witnesses. My fiance chatted normally with guests as if she didn't know her world was about to be destroyed for sport. And I hated myself for every fake smile. The salad course passed and my hands shook as my mother whispered to my aunt that the show was about to begin. And still I said nothing. My cousin started recording on her phone and my uncle moved to block the exit. And these were my people gleefully preparing to destroy the woman I claim to love. Right on cue, a woman in a tight red dress burst through the doors sobbing dramatically. Can't let you marry him without knowing I'm three months pregnant with his baby and he promised he'd leave you for me. The room gasped and everyone turned to my fiance, who sat frozen for a heartbeat before jumping up with tears streaming down her face. But instead of devastation, her face showed pure joy. Oh, my god, this is perfect because I'm also pregnant with my best friend Jeremy's baby. We can all raise our.

I worked at Rosie's Diner for almost two years saving up for college. Most customers were decent, but this one guy named Doug made my shifts hell. Every Tuesday at lunch, he'd show up with his work buddies acting like he owned the place. Doug would snap his fingers at me, complain about everything and never left a single tip, not even a quarter. The worst part, he'd mock me in front of his co workers, called me sweetheart in this condescending way. Once I brought the wrong salad dressing and he literally rolled his eyes and said loud enough for everyone, fun to hear. Can't even handle ranch dressing. Good luck in life. His buddies would laugh. I'd smile and apologize because I needed this job. One Tuesday, Doug came in extra loud. He was bragging about some presentation he gave. When I took their order, he mumbled something about no onions on his burger. Kitchen was slammed. So when his food came out with onions, he lost it. Are you kidding me right now? Do I need to spell everything out for you? His voice carried across the whole restaurant. I apologized and got him a new burger. But while I was walking back to their table, I heard one of his co workers, Amy, whisper to another guy, he's always like this. It's embarrassing. That caught my attention. Amy seemed uncomfortable every time Doug went off on Me. After they left with their usual zero tip, I had an idea. I remember Doug mentioning he worked at Fletcher Marketing down the street. So I did some research. Turns out Fletcher Marketing was hosting a big charity event next month at our restaurant. They were bringing in potential clients to show off their company culture. I wrote an email, not some angry rant, but a professional complaint with specific dates and examples of Doug's behavior. I sent it to Fletcher's HR department explaining how their employees conduct might reflect poorly on their company, especially with the upcoming charity event being held where I worked. Two weeks later, Doug came in for his usual Tuesday lunch, but this time something was different. He was quieter, didn't snap his fingers once, actually said please and thank you. His co workers seemed more relaxed too. After they finished eating, Amy walked up to me while Doug was in the bathroom. She slipped me a 20 and said he got written up at work. Apparently someone complained about his behavior here. Management told him if it happened again, he'd lose his spot on the charity event planning committee. That's a big deal for him. She paused and smiled. We all chipped in for your tip today. You've been nothing but professional with us even when he's been awful. When Doug came back, he actually left a five dollar tip, first time ever. As they were leaving, I heard him tell his group Thanks for lunch, guys. Same time next week. But Amy shook her head. Actually, we found a new place, better atmosphere.

I said cancel the entire wedding? She gasped. But sir, you're not the bride. No, but I own the venue, the catering company and the hotel chain they booked for guests. See, my brother James was marrying this entitled socialite, Melissa. Her mom, Eleanor, treated me like hired help from day one. They made insane demands, wanted me to remove a historic chandelier because it clashed with the aesthetic, made my staff create 15 different sample menus before choosing, then demanded we redo them because the fonts were too common. The worst part, they'd schedule meetings with my venue coordinator at 6:00am, then cancel 30 minutes before. My poor manager, Anthony, would drive across town for nothing. You're a saint for putting up with this, he told me after Eleanor demanded we repaint the entire ballroom because the current shade of ivory was too pedestrian. Eleanor also insisted we fire our head chef because he looked unprofessional, meaning he was Hispanic. I refused, but she kept pushing. I tolerated it because I love James. Growing up, it was just us two after our parents divorced messily. I practically raised him while mom worked three jobs. When I, I built my hotel empire from nothing, starting as a waitress and working my way up. James was my biggest cheerleader. He'd brag to friends about his sister who made it big. But Melissa changed him completely. Suddenly, my new money was embarrassing. Eleanor would make comments about how some people think wealth means class. During one particularly nasty encounter, she looked around my flagship hotels lobby and sniffed. It's very commercial, isn't it? Not quite the atmosphere for discerning clientele. When invitation time came, nothing arrived in my mailbox. I waited weeks, checking daily. I called other family members. Everyone got theirs. Gorgeous gold foil with handwritten notes from Melissa thanking them for being true family. At our family dinner, Eleanor made it crystal clear there's a difference between serving the elite and being one of them. Don't you think, Natalie? She said my name like it tasted bitter. James just stared at his late. My own brother wouldn't defend me. That's when Melissa chimed in. The wedding is very intimate. We're keeping it to people who truly understand our vision. They saw me as the help, not family. Good enough to provide the venue, staff and accommodations, but not good enough to witness their special day. The wedding planners call was the last straw. They wanted me to pay but not attend my own brother's wedding. We've decided the guest list needs to be more refined, she explained awkwardly. But of course, all the vendor contracts remain in place. Exact.

My dad wasn't always so mean. He used to sing in the car and make pancakes with smiley faces every Sunday. He read us bedtime stories with different voices and played with us whenever we wanted. But then mom left us, telling dad he was too boring and nice for her and how she wanted an adventurous life with some guy on a motorcycle. Something in dad just broke when I tried to cheer him up with a drawing I made of our family. He wasn't interested. Not now, I'm busy. But, dad, I insisted. I made you super tall and strong. Dad suddenly raised his voice. I said, not now. I stumbled back and the drawing in my bag. I thought maybe it was just a really bad time for him. My sister and brother and I spent a whole week making a play for dad, hoping to help him smile again. We use the couch cushions to make a stage in the living room. My sister made tickets out of construction paper. We practiced every day after school while dad was at work. Dad, we have a surprise for you, I said. After dinner on Friday, we made a play, and you're invited. Dad looked at his phone and got up to leave. I have work to do. It's only 10 minutes. My brother promised. Please. My sister held out the golden ticket she made just for him. He sighed and Sat down, but kept his phone in his hand. We started to play and watched him scroll through emails in the first half. My sister ended up stopping midway, waiting for him to watch with tears in her ears. Dad, I said, trying to get his attention, can you please just watch? We worked really hard. He looked up at me with this cold expression. This is ridiculous. Less I don't have time for games. Then he stood up and walked to his office, leaving us to tear down and throw out everything we prepared for the play. Aunt Melanie visited about six months after mom left to check in on us. She listened to all our complaints about dad and how he stopped spending time with us. You're turning into your father, she told him. The kids need you, and you're shutting them down just like he did to you. Dad glared at her. Being soft got me nowhere. Look where being nice got me. They need to learn the world isn't kind. Aunt Melanie tried to argue, but dad wouldn't listen. After she left, he started working. Even later, we ate leftovers and stared at his empty chair air, waiting for him to come home. Instead of just being cold, dad also started becoming aggressive. Out of nowhere, my little sister asked him to read her a bedtime story, holding out the book we used to read together. You're not a kid anymore, he said. But she was Only 7. When my brother got the flu and asked dad to stay home from work, dad told him, you're fine. Stop being dramatic. And when I came home crying because kids at school called me names, dad barely reacted. Stop being so sensitive. Fight back or they'll never stop. When I couldn't stop crying, he stood up fast. I told you to stop! His hand went up and I flinched. He froze for a second, then lowered it. Go to your room! You're grounded. We eventually just stopped looking for him and started dealing with everyone on our own, without a single adult to rely on. It was lonely. But for the sake of my siblings, I wasn't ready to give up just yet. Father's Day was coming up, and I had this idea that maybe I could remind dad of who he used to be. I spent three weeks making a photo album called reasons my dad is amazing. Found old pictures from before when he smiled all the time. I drew pictures and wrote little notes on every page. Dad is amazing because he used to sing in the car. Dad is amazing because he made the best pancakes. Dad is amazing because his hugs made everything better. I felt proud of the outcome and bit sad how different everything had become. I was so nervous at dinner when I gave it to him. I made this for you, I said. He flipped through it and his Face got darker with every page. Why would you show me this? He asked, his voice almost threatening. I thought maybe you'd remember being happy, I said meekly. He slammed the album shut and threw it into the nearest trash bin. That person is gone. He was weak, too nice. Don't you ever bring him up again! He looked at me with eyes like dagger and. Grow up already! All the anger and frustration suddenly spilled over inside me. You're so mean! I hate you! I screamed. I hate you! I want my dad back! The room went completely silent. Dad's face seemed to

I understand. What she didn't know was that I've been planning to propose next week. The ring was already hidden in my sock drawer. A vintage emerald cut that cost me three months salary. I talked to her dad over beers at his favorite sports bar, booked our anniversary restaurant for Valentine's Day, even practiced the speech in my car during lunch breaks like a complete idiot. But when Lisa sat me down that Tuesday night, her face all serious and uncomfortable, talking about needing space to grow as individuals and finding ourselves, I just nodded calmly. Take all the time you need, I said, watching her fidget nervously with that silver bracelet I bought her last Christmas. She looked genuinely confused by how calm I was staying. Probably expected me to beg, cry, make some desperate, emotional speech about our four years together and all our future plans. Instead, I helped her pack her overnight bag, even folded her clothes neatly. The whole time she kept glancing at me like she was waiting for me to break down. The next morning, first thing, I walked straight into the jewelry store downtown and returned the ring. $2,000 back in my account. Just like that. The jeweler looked sympathetic, but didn't ask questions. Then I did something completely insane. I bought a one way ticket to Tokyo, leaving in 10 days. I'd always dreamed of teaching English. In Japan since college. But Lisa absolutely hated the idea whenever I brought it up, called it running away from real adult responsibility, and said I was being childish and unrealistic. We had our whole life mapped out. House in the suburbs, two kids, white picket fence. The worst. Two weeks later, I was standing in Shibuya crossing with one suitcase and absolutely terrible Japanese. Found a tiny teaching job at a conversation school in Akihabara. Rented a shoebox apartment with paper thin walls. Started learning the language from complete scratch, using phone apps and YouTube videos. For the first time in years, life felt electric and unpredictable. Every single day was an adventure. Meanwhile, my buddy Jake kept me updated on Lisa's journey of self discovery through social media. She was posting thirst traps daily on Instagram, hitting different trendy bars every weekend with her girlfriends, clearly living her absolute best single life. According to Jake, she kept casually asking mutual friends if I was doing okay, and seemed genuinely shocked that I'd actually left the country for real. Month three, my Japanese was finally good enough to have actual, real conversations. Beyond

My ex boyfriend, Jake, and I broke up two years ago, but we stayed friends. He was dating this girl, Emma, who seemed nice enough. And when their wedding invitation came in the mail, I honestly felt happy for them. The invitation said cocktail attire and I had this gorgeous white dress that I bought for my cousin's rehearsal dinner but never got to wear. Here's the thing, though. It wasn't wedding dress white. It was more like cream colored with tiny silver dots all over it. I paired it with a navy blazer and navy shoes. I thought I looked appropriate and classy. My roommate even said I looked great when I left that morning. I got to the church about 15 minutes before the ceremony started. The, the moment I walked in, I felt every single person's eyes on me. The ushers kind of froze when they saw me. And this older woman in the front row actually gasped out loud. I started to panic but figured maybe I was just imagining things. Then Jake's mom spotted me. She marched over in her purple mother of the groom dress, grabbed my arm and whispered, what on earth were you thinking? I was so confused. I asked her what she meant and she just stared at my dress like I had shown up naked. That's when it hit me. White dress, wedding? Oh, no. I Tried to explain that it was cream, not white, and I had a blazer, but she wasn't having it. She told me I needed to leave immediately or she'd have security escort me out. I was mortified. But then Jake appeared from the back room where he was getting ready. He saw the commotion and came over. His mom started explaining the situation to him, pointing at my dress like it was evidence in a crime scene. Jake looked at me, then at his mom, then back at me. I expected him to be angry or embarrassed. Instead, he started laughing. Not mean laughing, but genuine. Can't help it. Laughing, he said, mom.

My family discovered I was good with kids when I was 14 and babysat my cousin once. That single afternoon of watching cartoons turned me into their unpaid nanny for the next 12 years. At first, it was just by my sister dropping off her toddler just for an hour while she ran errands. That hour turned into six when she decided to get her nails done instead. I. I remember sitting on my floor surrounded by broken crayons and goldfish crackers, realizing I missed my shift at the coffee shop. My brother joined in with midnight text about his twins needing an emergency sitter for his concert plans. College, they took it even further. My sister would bang on my dorm door and dump her kids for entire weekends. She cost me my first serious boyfriend when she called me during our anniversary dinner screaming about a fake emergency. My boyfriend looked at me across that candlelit table and said he couldn't do this anymore. After graduation, my parents made everything worse by secretly giving my siblings keys to my apartment. I started coming home from my marketing job to find kids destroying my kitchen and toys taking over my home office. My boss pulled me aside after I'd missed another presentation and told me to figure out my priorities. The moment they took it too far came three months ago when I woke up to voices in my living room. I stumbled out of my pajamas to find four kids watching cartoons with suitcases next to them. My sister's two kids and my brother's twins were all there eating my cereal like it was just another Saturday. On my counter was a note that made my hand shake. My entire family had booked a month long cruise to Europe and decided not to tell me because I'd make it difficult, the note said. They knew I take good care of the kids like I always do. I kept reading it over and over trying to understand how they could just leave the country without even asking me. My sister had attached a grocery list and my brother left $200 for expenses. I was their personal hired help. They could book without notice. The youngest kid looked up and asked if I was making pancakes for breakfast. That innocent question broke something inside me because these kids had no idea their parents had just abandoned them. That's when I decided to teach them what abandonment really felt like. You see, 12 years of forced babysitting had taught me every rule about child welfare and what authorities look for. I made the kids breakfast and told them we were going to play a game where they told me about all the times they stayed with me before. I recorded videos on my phone as they excitedly shared stories about being dropped off for Days without their parents checking in. The seven year old even mentioned the time his mom left him here when he had strep throat. I carefully documented the suitcases, note and the pathetic $200 meant to last a month. Then I looked up the number for Child Protective Services. My family thought they were getting a free month in Europe. Instead, they were about to learn what happens when you abandon your children with someone who knows the system. I called CPS and reported four abandoned minors with no guardianship papers. The caseworker arrived within two hours and went pale reading the note. By afternoon, the kids were in emergency.

The school janitor had been quietly saving her for months. I used to dread Tuesdays. Every week, like clockwork, my 12 year old daughter Lily would come home from school and have a complete meltdown at exactly three PM. Not the typical tantrums most parents navigate pair. These were full body primal screams that would last for hours. Lily has nonverbal autism. She communicates through a tablet app, but emotional moments often leave her without words. I'd ask what happened on Tuesdays. She just rocked back and forth. Tablet abandoned. I tried everything. Changed her Tuesday lunch, requested different classes, even drove her to school myself instead of letting her take the special needs bus. Nothing worked. The school counselor suggested it might be sensory overload from Tuesday's gym class, but removing her from P didn't help. Last month I reached my breaking point after a particularly brutal meltdown where Lily scratched her arms until they bled. I decided to pick her up early the following Tuesday to observe what might be triggering her. At two thirty PM, I arrived at school and signed in at the office. Instead of announcing my arrival, I asked if I could quietly observe for a few minutes. Principal, knowing our struggles, agreed. I found Lily's class in the library. She wasn't having a meltdown, Pern. She was sitting calmly at a table, focused on a book about butterflies. My confusion Deepened as the class lined up to return to their room, I followed at a distance. That's when I noticed an older man in a gray janitor's uniform, watching the hallway intently. When Lily's class passed, he quickly turned away, pushing his mop toward the exit doors. Something made me follow him outside. I watched as he rushed toward the special needs buses. What happened next made my heart stop. The janitor approached the third bus in line. Pen Lily's bus paired, and spoke urgently to the driver. The driver nodded and stepped out, walking toward the school building. The moment he was gone, the janitor climbed aboard. I ran toward the bus, terrified, but when I reached the steps, what I saw through the door left me frozen. The janitor was quickly moving through the bus, opening every window. All

So I was about 12 at the time and on vacation with my family at this beach resort in Florida. We'd rented a condo right on the beach for two weeks and I was absolutely obsessed with building the most epic sandcastles possible. I'd wake up every morning at like 7:00am, grab my bucket and tools and claim the perfect spot on the beach before it got crowded. This particular day, I'd spent almost four hours building what I considered my masterpiece. Talking multiple towers connected by walls, a functioning moat system that filled and emptied with a tide and even a little village area with tiny sandhouses. Other families were stopping to take pictures with their kids. Parents were complimenting my architectural skills. I felt like the king of the beach. Then disaster struck in the form of this group of teenagers, probably around 16 or 17. They've been walking down the beach being loud and obnoxious, but I didn't think much of it until they stopped right in front of my castle. Dude, look at this nerd castle, one of them said loud enough for everyone nearby to hear. Before I could even react, the biggest kid in the group just walked up and punted my main tower like he was kicking a field goal. Sand exploded everywhere. Then his friends joined in, stomping and kicking until my entire 4 hour project was just a pile Of scattered sand and broken shells. They walked away laughing while I just stood there in shock. Other families were looking at me with sympathy, but nobody said anything to the teenagers. I, I was too young and too stunned to even think of a response. That night, I was furious. My parents tried to comfort me, but they just gave me the typical some people are just mean lecture. I decided I needed a better plan than hoping adults would intervene. The next morning, I started building again, but this time with a secret weapon. I found the heaviest, most angular rock I could carry, about the size of a softball, but with really sharp jutting edges. Buried it deep in the centre of what would become my main tower, position perfectly at kick height. I built around it carefully, making sure the rock was completely hidden, but would take the full impact of any kick. The rest of the castle was just as elaborate as the day before, maybe even better since I'd Learned from my previous design. Sure enough, around noon, the same group of teenagers showed up. I pretended to be busy.

My 14 year old daughter started asking to sleep over at friends houses every weekend. And I thought it was just normal teenage social stuff. But then I noticed the pattern. Every Monday morning she'd come home looking absolutely destroyed. Dark circles so deep they looked like bruises. Shoulders hunched, dragging her feet like each step hurt. When I asked about the sleepovers, she just mumble it was fun and disappear into her room. Her math teacher emailed saying she'd had a panic attack during class when he'd casually asked about her weekend plans. Her violin teacher called to say she'd quit, just walked out mid lesson without explanation. She lost 10 pounds in just over a month. Her favorite jeans hung loose on her hips. She barely touched breakfast anymore. Started missing Sunday family dinners, events she'd never miss before, not even when she had the flu. My partner thought I was losing it. She's 14, Lisa. Girls have sleepovers. You're being paranoid. But when I was cleaning her room, I found energy drink cans stuffed behind her dresser, dozens of them. My sweet girl who used to drink nothing but herbal tea, my mom instincts weren't just whispering anymore, they were screaming. I started watching her more carefully. She'd get text on Friday afternoon and her whole body would change. Shoulders would tense up, face would go pale, hands would start trembling as she packed always the same overnight bag. But I Noticed something odd. Work gloves sticking out of the side pocket. No more family game nights on Saturdays. No more baking cookies together on Sunday mornings. No more asking me to braid her hair before bed. It was like she was being pulled away from us by some invisible force. One day I was passing her room when I heard her on the phone. Her voice was different, scared, desperate almost. I know, I know I'll be there, her voice cracked. I can't do this every weekend anymore. Please. A pause. No, I understand. I promise I won't tell anyone. Then I heard her crying. Real gut wrenching sobs that made my chest tighten. The next morning at breakfast, I asked casually, which friend's house are you going to tonight, honey? Her spoon clattered into her cereal bowl. Her eyes darted to her phone like it might save her. Just, just Marlene's. Her mom already said yes. But I called Marlene's mom last week. Marlene had been at her dad's house in another state for the past month. That's when I really started noticing her phone behaviour. When a specific notification sound played, just two quick beeps, her entire body would go rigid. Then she'd immediately delete whatever she'd seen. Something was very, very wrong with my daughter. I waited until she left for her sleepover that Saturday night. Then I did something I'd sworn I'd never do. I followed her. She didn't walk like a teenager heading to a Fun sleepover. She walked like someone heading to their execute, taking a weird winding route through the neighborhood, doubling back twice, constantly checking over her shoulder. At one point, she stopped completely, stood under a streetlight, and I watched her take deep, shuddering breaths like she was preparing for battle. She pulled out her phone and typed something. Even from my car, I could see her hands shaking as she hit send. The response must have been immediate because her shoulders slumped into defeat. Then she kept walking. What I discovered made my stomach drop to the floor. She didn't go.

Nothing but an annoyance to talk to? And no, I won't tell anyone privately about this. Because what if someone starts talking to me out of pity? Because they feel obligated to? In fact, just telling you all this makes me feel like I'm begging for attention. I just want to feel appreciated. Like my presence is enjoyed by someone. Like someone will notice when I'm gone. Someone will reach out to me when I seem quieter than usual. Someone will care about me even when I feel unlovable. Just someone. Please. Anyways, bye. This is trend hopper 1:01 signing out. I hope no one else feels this way about themselves.

My grandmother told me, stop renting apartments and buy the worst house in the best neighborhood you can afford. Fix it up yourself and you'll thank me in 20 years. When I was 24, I just got my first real job as a nurse and was looking at nice rental apartments. Everyone my age was living in trendy downtown lofts, showing off their granite countertops and gym amenities. But grandma pulled me aside at Sunday dinner and made me drive with her through this expensive neighborhood I'd never considered. She pointed at this tiny, rundown house with peeling paint, an overgrown yard. That eyesore has been on the market for eight months. She said nobody wants it because it looks terrible next to these million dollar homes. But the bones are good and you can't fake location. I looked at her like she was crazy. The house was hideous. Broken shutters, dead lawn. Probably needed everything redone. Grandma, I don't know how to fix houses. I barely know how to change a light bulb. She laughed. I didn't know how to raise four kids until I had them. You learn by doing. That conversation stuck with me for weeks while I toured shiny rental apartments with my friends. Finally, I called a realtor and looked at grandma's ugly house. It was worse inside. Carpet from the 1970s, pink bathroom tile, kitchen cabinets that looked like they belonged in a trailer. But It was in the best school district in the city, walking distance to parks, and surrounded by houses worth 10 times more. I put in an offer, $40,000. Low asking price. They accepted immediately. My friends thought I'd lost my mind. Every time we hung out, they'd show off their modern amenities while roasting my dump. One friend said I could never live somewhere that embarrassing. What if I brought a date home to that disaster? Another kept joking that I was living in the neighborhood crack house. They'd brag about their rooftop pools and doorman, then ask if my house had running water yet. I'll admit, pulling up next to their luxury buildings in my beat up Honda, I wondered if grandma was wrong. But then, and I'd remember her saying, pretty apartments make you a renter forever, ugly houses make you wealthy. For three years, I spent every weekend at Home Depot learning to do everything myself. YouTube became my construction university. I Learned I wall, plumbing, electrical work, landscaping, whatever needed fixing. My social life basically ended because everyone assumed I was too broke to go out. While my friends were posting Instagram stories from expensive restaurants, I was covered in paint trying to make my house livable. Slowly, I started recognizing what good bones actually meant. The foundation was solid, the roof just needed new shingles. The plumbing was old but functional. Most importantly, three more houses on my street sold to young families willing to renovate. And property values started climbing fast. The neighborhood was gentrifying, exactly like grandma predicted. Coffee shops opened, new restaurants moved in. The elementary school got renovated and started winning awards. Then the pandemic hit, and everything changed suddenly.

What she accidentally overheard during the appointment made me uninvite my entire bridal party. I was dead asleep, and my phone rang at midnight. The caller ID showed a number I didn't recognize, but something made me answer. Is this Rachel? A woman's voice thick with tears. Yes. Who is this? My name is Carla. I'm a spray tan artist at Bronzo. I just. I need to tell you something about your wedding, about your bridesmaids. I sat up suddenly wide awake. My wedding was in five days. My entire bridal party had appointments at Bronzo tomorrow for matching spray tans. Your maid of honor, Jessica, came in tonight for an early appointment. Carla continued. She was on speaker phone the whole time. I heard everything. I couldn't sleep without telling you. What did you hear? Carla took a shaky breath. They're planning to ruin your wedding. All of them. They have a whole plan. My stomach dropped. That's impossible. These are my best friends. I recorded it, Carla said. I know I shouldn't have, but it was so horrible. I'll send you the audio. The recording came through immediately. I recognized Jessica's voice right away. Talking to someone on speaker while Carla worked. Operation Ugly Bride is a go. Jessica laughed. Everyone knows their role. My bridesmaid Ashley's voice responded. I got the dress. My seamstress friend is taking it in four sizes tonight. Rachel won't know. Until she tries to zip it tomorrow. Another voice. My cousin Megan. I booked the wrong makeup artist. The one who did that Halloween zombie wedding. Told her Rachel wants dramatic look. Perfect, Jessica said. And I confirmed with the DJ. He's going to play nothing but Rachel's ex's favorite songs, including their song for the Father Daughter Dance. I listened in horror as they detailed their plan. The flowers have been changed to the ones I was allergic to. The photographer was instructed to only take unflattering angles. They'd even coordinated their bridesmaid dress malfunctions to happen during the ceremony. Why? Ashley asked in the recording. I mean, I'm in, but remind me why we're destroying her wedding. Jessica's voice turned cold. Because she doesn't deserve Chris. She thinks she so perfect with her perfect job and perfect life. Someone needs to bring her down. Plus, Chris had feelings for me first. He only asked her out because I was dating Brad. Girl, that was 5 years ago, Megan pointed out. Doesn't matter. I introduced them. He was supposed to be mine. This wedding is a joke. The recording continued with more details. They've been planning this for months, ever since I asked Jessica to be my maid of honor. Every supportive text, every planning session, every happy moment had been fake. The best part, Jessica giggled, is the speech I'm giving. I'm going to tell everyone about her anxiety attacks. That time she wet herself at camp in 7th grade. And how Chris almost broke up with her last year because she's so she'll die of embarrassment. Ashley agreed. Maybe she'll run out of her own wedding. That's the goal. Chris will see what a mess she is and realize he made a mistake. Carla came back on the line. I'm so sorry I had to tell you. No one deserves that. I hung up and immediately called Chris. He answered groggily until I played him in the recording. I heard him get out of bed. He is jingling. I'm coming over, he said. This is insane. Spent the night contacting vendors. The florist confirmed the flower change. The DJ admitted to the playlist swap. The makeup artist thought the zombie request was weird but assumed it was a themed wedding. The seamstress had already taken in my dress when we picked it up at 3:00am. After threatening legal action. It was unwearable, four sizes smaller, with the seams reinforced so they couldn't be let out. By 6:00am, we had a new plan. I called each bridesmaid individually, starting with Jessica. Hey, can't wait for today's tanning session? She chirped. Actually, there's been a change. The wedding is off. Silence. Then what? Why? Chris and I decided to elope. Too much stress. We're flying to Vegas this afternoon. Jessica tried to sound supportive, but I heard the disappointment. Oh, but all the planning. Yeah. You can cancel your spray tan appointment. Sorry for the inconvenience. I made similar Calls to the others. Each one

I was 15 when my life basically flipped upside down in the weirdest way possible. For months, I've been having these crazy stomach cramps that made me double over in the middle of class. My parents kept saying it was just stress from school, maybe too much coffee or whatever. But our family doctor wasn't buying it and sent me to get a full allergy panel done. I remember sitting in that sterile clinic room rolling my eyes as the nurse prepped like 50 different allergen samples. I was thinking, great, I'm probably allergic to peanuts or milk like every other kid, maybe shellfish if I'm unlucky. The nurse started pricking my arm with tiny needles, each one containing a different substance, dust mites, pollen, cat dander, the usual suspects. She kept checking her watch and marking down reactions as little red bumps appeared on my skin. Most were barely visible, just tiny dots that looked like mosquito bites. But then I noticed her face change when she looked at one specific spot on my arm. The area around this one test site was literally bubbling up like a balloon. My skin was bright red and swelling so fast I could actually watch it grow. The nurse called in Doctor Kim, the allergist. I took one look at my arm and I swear her clipboard hit the floor. She whispered Oh, no, under her breath and immediately started ordering additional tests. I was like, what the hell is happening? What could possibly be that bad? Turns out I was severely allergic to chlorinated water. Not just sensitive, actually allergic to the chemical compound they use in basically every pool, hot tub and even some shower systems to keep water clean. My body was treating chlorine like it was poison, which technically for me it was. Everything suddenly made sense. Remember when I fainted during swim practice last year? Coach Mitchell thought I was being dramatic and made me run laps instead. Those family trips to water parks where I'd get mysteriously sick out.

The caption read, the ones who truly matter. So I cancelled the flights. Then 42 missed texts. I called and said only six words. I live in Seattle, work in tech and haven't been home to Ohio in two years. The distance wasn't just geographic. Every family gathering ended the same way, me feeling invisible while my brother Adrian got all the attention. When mom called about Thanksgiving, she was practically begging, Clara, please come home. The whole family will be here. Adrian, Marissa, the kids, we miss you so much. Her voice cracked a little. I know we haven't always. I just want my family together. That got to me. Maybe she'd realized how they'd been treating me. Maybe this could be a fresh start. I booked flights for me and my boyfriend Elias, $800 round trip. Plus I offered to bring dessert from this fancy bakery mom loves, the one that costs $60 per pie. That's perfect, honey. This will be our best Thanksgiving ever. I was actually excited. Maybe things would be different this time. Growing up, I was always the responsible one. While Adrian party through college, I studied while he job hopped for five years. I climbed the corporate ladder. When he got married and had kids, suddenly he became the golden child again. Every holiday was the Adrian show. His promotions, his kids achievements, his vacation photos. I'd sit there Nodding, asking questions, being the supportive sister. But when I got promoted to senior developer, crickets. When I bought my condo. That's nice, honey. Last Christmas, I mentioned I was thinking about proposing to Elias. Mom's exact words, don't you think you should focus on your career first? Meanwhile, when Adrian announced his third pregnancy, they threw a party. But Mom's call felt different. Desperate, almost like she genuinely wanted me there. I even went shopping for a new outfit, something that would photograph well for family pictures. I was determined to make this work. The plan was simple. Fly in Wednesday night, stay through Sunday. Elias was nervous about meeting everyone, but I assured him they'd love him. He's everything parent.

Months later, they were begging me to donate my kidney and I smiled. I was 19 when I collapsed at our family barbecue. Sharp chest pain, couldn't breathe the whole nine yards. My mom looked at me gasping on the ground and said, stop being dramatic. You're fine. My dad agreed. She's always been an attention seeker. Just breathe through it. Even my older brother rolled his eyes. Here we go again with the theatrics. This wasn't new growing up. Anytime I got sick or hurt, I was faking it or overreacting. Broken wrist from falling off my bike. It's just bruised. Walk it off. Throat so bad I couldn't swallow. You're fine. Go to school. Food poisoning that had me throwing up for hours. Stop being such a baby. So when I hit the ground, clutching my chest, gasping like a fish out of water, they just saw another perform. My mom literally stepped over me to flip the burgers. My dad kept chatting with my uncle about football scores. My brother took a photo, probably planning to mock me with it later. Please, I wheezed, barely able to form words. Something's really wrong. Call 9, 1 1. My mom sighed dramatically. Oh, my god, Sarah, enough. You're embarrassing us in front of everyone. My aunt tried to intervene. Maybe we should. No. Dad cut her off firmly. She pulls this crap all the time. If we give in, Now she'll never stop. I was literally seeing spots, my vision going dark around the edges. The pain felt like someone was squeezing my heart with pliers. I'd never felt anything like it in my life. I can't breathe, I gasped. Then stop talking, my brother said, not even looking up from his phone. I begged them for 20 minutes, 20 minutes of writhing on their patio while they ate potato salad and ignored me. Finally, I managed to crawl inside and dial 9, 1 1 myself with shaking hands. The paramedic took one look at me in his face.

Brandon broke up with me. At his company's annual holiday party right in front of the dessert table where everyone could hear, he announced to his co workers that I was holding him back from reaching his real potential and that I'd never find anyone as ambitious and success asshole as him. He actually gestured toward the crowd and said, look around. These are the kind of people I need to be networking with, not wasting time on someone who doesn't understand my vision. I was mortified. His brother Mason happened to be there for work. Turns out he just transferred from corporate headquarters as the new regional director. Brandon had mentioned his brother was coming but conveniently forgot to mention Mason was now his boss. Mason heard every humiliating word and looked absolutely mortified by his brother's behavior. Two weeks later, I get this text from an unknown number. Hi, this is Mason, Brandon's brother. I know this is weird, but would you be willing to grab coffee? I feel like I need to apologize for what happened at the party. My brother was completely out of line. I almost delete it. The last thing I need is more drama with Brandon's family. But something about the message feels genuine, not pitying. So I agree to meet at this little cafe Downtown. Coffee turns into a three hour conversation. Mason's nothing like Brandon. He doesn't name drop Or brag about his position. Instead, he asks about my work as a graphic designer, actually listens when I talk about my freelance projects. When I mention I've been hiking to clear my head after the breakup, his eyes light up. Turns out he's been looking for hiking partners since moving to town. Coffee becomes weekend hiking trips. Mason knows all these hidden trails around the city. We talk about everything, books, travel, dreams are completely different childhoods, he tells me. Brandon always got the attention growing up by being the loudest person in the room, while Mason preferred staying in the back.

My brother Kevin and sister Lisa spent those three days planning how they'd split up Dad's assets while I sat in the back row of the church, ignored, as usual. For 20 years, I've been the family disappointment, dropped out of college, bounced between jobs in a studio apartment above Mrs. Chen's bakery. Meanwhile, Kevin was the successful lawyer and Lisa ran her own marketing firm. They had houses, families, careers dad could brag about. Two years ago, dad finally had enough. You're 35 and still asking for money, he said, throwing my rent payment back at me. Figure your life out somewhere else. This family is done carrying dead weight. Kevin nodded approvingly from the couch. Tough love, dad. He needs to learn responsibility. Lisa chimed in. Maybe this will motivate him to actually do something with his life. I moved in with my friend Tony and cut contact completely. No birthdays, no holidays, no phone calls. They made it clear I wasn't wanted, so I stayed away.

Kevin's mouth actually fell open. Lisa started shaking her head like she'd misheard. That's impossible, Kevin stammered. Dad cut him off. He called him worthless. Mister Peterson pulled out a sealed letter. Your father left specific instructions to read this aloud. He cleared his throat and began. Kevin and Lisa, you both told me Daniel needed top.

I forgot to take out the trash before six PM and started crying before my mom even said anything because I knew what was coming. She grabbed my arm, dragged me to the kitchen and poured uncooked rice across the floor. Kneel on it, she said. I dropped to my knees and the rice dug into my skin like tiny needles. She set the microwave timer for 20 minutes. You'll stay there until it beeps. This is how you learn discipline. My knees went numb after five minutes, but if I shifted even slightly, she'd restart the timer. I'm making you perfect. This is what love looks like. That wasn't just normal for us. It was routine. When I got a B instead of an a, she'd make me stand outside in the sun for three hours. No water, doors locked, neighbors walking by pretending not to see. The world is cruel, she'd say when she finally let me back in. I'm preparing you for it. Every punishment makes you stronger. This is how a good mother loves her son.

Just for an hour, I said, already calculating how fast I need to run home. His house was only six blocks from school, a small two story with a garden full of tomatoes and a doormat that said welcome in three languages. His mom, Elena, opened the door before we could knock. You must be Chloe's friend. Come in. Come in. I made lumpia. She had flower in her hair, but it didn't dampen her bright smile. The house smelled like fried food and something we baking, not like the cigarette smoke and cheap wine that clung to our walls. A few minutes later, as Chloe was carrying two glasses of juice, he tripped over their cat. The glass shattered across the hardwood floor, orange juice spreading everywhere. My brain froze and I acted on instinct. I immediately dropped to my knees, frantically picking up glass pieces with my bare hands, already stammering apologies that weren't mine to make. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. We'll clean it up. Please don't. But Elena was already rushing over, not to slap Cologne, but instead to kneel beside me. Honey, stop. You'll cut yourself. She gently took my hands, checking for cuts. Are you two okay? Did you step on any glass? Cologne just laughed. I'm fine, mom. Sorry about the juice. She ruffled his hair in response, which shocked me beyond belief. It's just juice, baby. Accidents happen. Let me get the mop. No timer. No rice, no locked doors, just a mop and a new glass of.

Our school's ancient Coca Cola vending machine had been broken for three weeks straight. The thing was a prehistoric relic from the 90s with faded red paint and a cracked display screen. It would gladly accept your crisp dollar bills, make all the right mechanical sounds, then give you absolutely nothing. Just kept your money like some kind of cafeteria loan shark. Student this complained every single day the freshman soccer team lost $12 in one lunch period alone. Kids would stand there frantically pressing buttons, shaking the machine, even kicking it in frustration. Nothing worked. The athletic director kept promising maintenance would fix it by end of week, but weeks kept passing. My teacher's AP physics classroom was directly adjacent to this mechanical thief. Every period she'd hear the same cycle, coins dropping, buttons clicking, then angry groaning followed by metallic banging. She started positioning herself by her door window during passing periods, convinced someone was going to break the glass or damage school property. What she didn't realize was that I've been conducting my own little engineering experiment. During lunch breaks, while other kids gave up after losing their money, I stayed behind studying the machine's internal mechanisms. The dollar Bill reader was completely jammed with what looked like years of crumpled bills. But I noticed the coin slot mechanism was still functioning perfectly after some careful Observation and testing, I discovered something interesting. If you tied a thin fishing line to a quarter and fed it through the coin slot exactly seven times in a specific rhythm, the machine's ancient counting system would register it as $1, 75, just enough for any snack inside. I started small, just getting my own chips when I didn't have cash. But then I noticed Sarah, this quiet freshman who always sat alone, staring sadly at her trapped dollar Bill. She'd been saving lunch money all week to buy her first snack from school. That's when I realized I could actually help people. For two weeks, I ran an underground snack.

Okay, so I'm a 31 year old single mom to my daughter Emma who's 8. Last month I found out about this summer program at her school where kids can go before the year starts to do fun activities and get used to their new classroom. Emma was super excited about it. So we went shopping for all the required supplies. Now here's the thing. At Emma's old school, kids would steal her stuff constantly. Her cute erasers would disappear. Her good coloured pencils would vanish and she'd come home upset asking why everyone took her things. So this time I wasn't taking any chances. I went full mom mode on those supplies. I used permanent marker to write E, m, m, a in big letters on every single crayon, marker, glue stick and even the individual pieces of paper in her notebook. I glued her name onto her clear backpack with industrial adhesive so nobody could peel it off. I wrote her initials on every single page of her sketchbook. I even carved her name into her pencil case with a knife. Emma thought it was fun watching me label everything. We made it into a game where she'd hand me each item and I'd find a new spot to put her name. By the end, you couldn't look at any of her supplies without seeing E, m. M. A written somewhere. First day of the program arrives And Emma's bouncing off the walls, excited. I packed her labeled backpack, gave her a kiss and sent her off. When I picked her up that afternoon, she looked confused and kind of sad. Turns out the teacher had made an announcement that all the supplies were going into a big communal pile to be shared equally among all the kids. Teacher said some families couldn't afford to buy supplies, so they were redistributing everything to make it fair. But here's where it gets crazy. When the teacher started sorting through the supplies and saw E, m, m, a written on literally everything, she got annoyed. She apparently held up Emma's crayon box in front of the whole class and said this is what happens when parents don't read the instructions properly and made Emma feel embarrassed. The teacher called me that evening. She explained that they pull all supplies together because not every family can afford the full list. Some kids show up with nothing and they don't want anyone to feel left out. I told her I understood the concept, but asked why Emma had to be humiliated in front of everyone. The teacher said Emma would need to bring unmarked.

It was almost midnight and my friend and I were starving. Not just I could eat hungry, more like if I don't get food soon, I might start hallucinating a Big Mac hungry. So we drove to the only place that could save us, McDonald's. We walked in, ordered enough food to feed a family of five and sat down like kings. Double cheeseburgers, 20 piece nuggets, fries, shakes, the kind of meal where people start rethinking their life choices afterward. Everything was perfect and then the cops walked in. At first I wasn't even paying attention. I was too busy dunking a nugget and sauce like I was conducting a science experiment. Then I noticed two officers staring directly at us. Before I could even swallow, they were at our table. Stand up and put your hands behind your backs. I froze. One second I was peacefully enjoying my food. The next I was apparently a criminal. Was eating too much. Illegal. Now, did I unknowingly commit treason? Then they hit us with it. My idiot friend had paid for our meal with a fake $100 Bill. I turned to look at him, praying this was some kind of sick joke. This man had the audacity to just shrug and whisper, bro, money is money. No, it definitely isn't. I went into full survival mode. Officers, please, I had nothing to do with this. I just wanted Some nuggets. I was throwing him under the bus so fast. But I would do anything to not go to jail. I begged them to check the cameras, scan my fingerprints, call my kindergarten teacher if they had to. Luckily, they believed me. My friend, not so lucky. They slammed him against the squad car like he was public Enemy 1. As they were cuffing him, I had so many questions. Who even makes fake money? Where did he get it? I about to be an accessory to the dumbest crime ever. So before they drove off, I asked, dude, where did you even get that fake Bill? He just yelled back, monopoly. I had to take an Uber home in silence. But hey, at least I got some free food.

When I was 29, I'd already been through this song and dance with doctors like five times. Every time I went in for anything, they'd look at me, see that I was heavy and blame whatever was wrong on my weight. Headaches, lose weight, back pain, lose weight, weird rash, probably from sweating too much, lose weight. So when I started getting these crazy chest pains, I already knew what was coming. But these weren't like normal chest pain. They felt like someone was stabbing me right through my sternum with a hot knife, sharp, sudden and deep. I'd be sitting there watching TV and suddenly feel like I was being impaled. I went to the er on a Tuesday night around nine PM the place was packed. But when you say chest pain, they usually take you back pretty quick. The attending doctor was this middle aged guy who walked in, took one look at me and I could literally see him making assumptions. He poked my stomach a few times, asked how much I exercised and said the pain was probably just acid reflux or anxiety from stress eating. I tried to explain that it didn't feel like heartburn at all. This was different. But he was already writing something on his clipboard. He handed me a prescription for antacids and told me to cut back on spicy foods and maybe try Yoga for stress? I didn't even bother filling the prescription. What was the point? They never listen. Anyway, my roommate, Katie, was pissed when I told her what happened. She'd been dealing with the same kind of medical bias for years. We both joked about how doctors think being fat is some kind of terminal illness that causes every other symptom in the world. Three days later, I was brushing my teeth before bed when everything went weird. My vision got all blurry and spotty, like when you stand up too fast, but way worse. Sat down on the edge of the bathtub and tried to breathe through it, thinking maybe I was just dehydrated or something. But when I stood back up, my heart started going absolutely crazy, not just fast, but like it was trying to beat its way out of my chest. Boom, boom, boom, boom, so hard I could feel it in my ears. I called for Katie and she took one look at my face and said we were going back to the hospital. This time we got a different nurse on shift. Her name was Jennifer and she was probably in her 40s. Before I could even explain everything that happened, she was hooking me up to an EKG machine.

My boyfriend Jake is literally obsessed with Twilight, like scary obsessed. He has Edward Cullen posters in his room, owns all the books in hardcover and once drove three hours to some Twilight convention dressed as a vampire. When I found out we were having a girl at our 20 week ultrasound, the first words out of his mouth were perfect, we're naming her Renesme. I thought he was joking, but he wasn't. For weeks, every time someone asked about baby names, he'd say Renesme with this huge grin like it was the most brilliant idea ever. I kept telling him, no way, but he'd just brush me off. Babe, it's such a unique name. She'll be the only Renesme in her class. Yeah, Jake, there's a reason for that. Things got worse when my mom threw me a baby shower. Jake showed up with custom napkins that said Welcome Baby Renesme and a cake with the name written in purple frosting. I was mortified. All my aunts were looking at me like I'd lost my mind. When my cousin Ashley asked if we were seriously naming our kid after that weird vampire baby, Jake got defensive and started explaining the whole Twilight plot to a room full of confused middle aged women. The breaking point came when I was 35 weeks pregnant. I was scrolling through Instagram in bed when I saw Jake had posted a picture of my ultrasound. With the caption, can't wait to meet you, Renesme Marie Rodriguez. Daddy loves you already. I completely lost it. Not only had he used the name I explicitly said no to, but he'd added his last name without even asking me. We weren't even engaged. Delete this right now. I told him why. My friends are already commenting on it. Look, everyone thinks it's cute. I looked at the comments. Most were just heart emojis. But his buddy Tyler had written, oh, that's actually fire. And some girl from his work commented, such a beautiful name choice. I don't care what your friends think. I'm not naming our daughter after some fictional character from the worst vampire series ever made. Jake's face went red. Twilight isn't stupid. And Renesmee is a beautiful name that combines Bella's mom's name with Edward's mom's name. It has meaning. Yeah, meaning to you. But I'm the one who's been carrying this baby.

My sister Jessica, has always thought the rules don't apply to her. She's 25, but still acts like she's 16 and mom will fix everything for her. Last month, she totaled her Honda after rear ending some guy at a red light because she was texting. Insurance wouldn't cover a new car since it was her third accident in two years, so Jessica started begging me to borrow my Toyota whenever she needed to go somewhere. At first I said yes because I felt bad, but then she started pushing it. She'd keep my car for entire weekends. When I needed it for work, she brought it back with an empty gas tank every single time. Once I found fast food wrappers and empty soda cans all over my seats, like she'd been living in there. The final straw was when she returned it with this huge scratch down the passenger side. When I asked what happened, he just shrugged and said, parking lots are tight these days. No apology, no offer to pay for the damage, nothing. I told her she couldn't borrow my car anymore. She threw a complete fit and called me selfish. She said family was supposed to help each other and that I was being mean just because she'd made a few tiny mistakes. Last Tuesday morning, I went outside to drive to work and my car was gone. I checked everywhere. Maybe I parked it on the street and forgotten. Nope. I called Jessica three times, and it went straight to voicemail. That's when I saw her Instagram story from two hours earlier. She was at some coffee shop 40 minutes away with my car clearly visible in the background. She'd posted about meeting her friend Katie for brunch and having the best Tuesday ever. I was furious. I. I'd specifically told her no more borrowing, and she'd just taken it anyway, like my opinion didn't matter. I had to call in late to work and take an expensive Uber that cost me 30 bucks. I called her again, and this time she picked up. I could hear laughing and music in the background. She said, oh, hey, I borrowed your car real quick. I'll bring it back later. Don't worry about it. I told her to bring it back right now because I never said she could take it. She laughed and said I was being dramatic and that she'd only be gone a few hours. Then she hung up on me. That's when I

For 3 years straight, Danny would act surprised when my birthday rolled around. First year he said work was crazy and he'd make it up to me. Second year he claimed his phone died so he lost track of dates. Last year he literally asked me why I seemed upset on February 15th, like he had no clue it was the day after my birthday. Meanwhile, this guy remembered every sports stat from 1995 and could tell you exactly when his favourite show aired each week. He had phone reminders for oil changes, dentist appointments, even when to water his plants. But somehow my birthday was this impossible thing to keep track of. My friends kept telling me to just remind him or send hints, but that felt pathetic. If some someone cares about you, they remember what matters to you without being nagged about it. This year, I decided to test something. Two weeks before my birthday, I started dropping hints everywhere. I left my birth certificate on the kitchen counter. I circled February 14th on the calendar with a big red heart. I even mentioned it during dinner. My birthday is coming up soon, I said, while we ate tacos. He just nodded and kept scrolling his phone. The week before, I got more obvious. I showed him a dress online and said this would be perfect for my birthday dinner next week. He mumbled something about it. Being nice and went back to watching TV. Three days before, I literally said, so what are we doing for my birthday Thursday? He looked confused and asked, what's Thursday? When I told him it was my birthday, he slapped his forehead like he always did and said, right? Yeah, I've been so busy with work stuff. Thursday morning came. I woke up expecting something, anything, maybe flowers by my bedside or breakfast in bed. Nothing. He got dressed, kissed my cheek and said he'd be back late because of a client dinner. Not even a happy birthday. I sat there in my pajamas until noon feeling stupid for hoping things would be different this year. Then I remembered something. His birthday was exactly one month later, March 14th. And for the past four years, I'd thrown him surprise parties, bought expensive gift.

So I live in this ground floor apartment in this converted house and the back has this huge wall of windows that basically looks right into my neighbour's backyard. When I picked the place I was like this is perfect because I love plants and the light was amazing. Neighbors live one street over but their backyard faces mine, so we're maybe 15 feet apart. Everything was cool until it got warm and I started noticing the husband from that family just staring into my apartment. And I'm not talking about a quick glance when he's walking by. This guy would be standing there looking for minutes at a time. I'd catch him, look away, then look back and he'd still be there, just gaping. At first I thought maybe I was being paranoid, but then it started happening every single day. I'd be making coffee in the morning and there he'd be watching TV. At night, there he was again. It got so bad that I started closing my blinds during the day. But that sucked because my place turns into this dark cave and my plants were dying without sunlight. So I did some research and found these window films that turn your windows into one way mirrors. During the day, when it's bright outside, people can't see in, but from inside it just looks Slightly tinted. The whole section I covered was like 8 feet high and 20 feet wide. Cost me about 200 bucks, but I figured it was worth it for some privacy. After about a week of having these up, both the neighbour parents showed up at my door. The wife was pissed and started listing all these complaints. She said the mirrors were ugly and made their backyard look weird. Their teenage kids and their friends felt uncomfortable hanging out by their pool because there was this giant mirror reflecting everything. She also said it was bouncing sunlight into their yard in the afternoons and they couldn't eat dinner on their back porch without getting blinded. I apologized for the inconvenience, but told them I needed it for privacy. That's when they both started pushing back, asking why I needed so much privacy. So I straight up told them it was because her husband kept staring into my apartment. The guy immediately started denying it right in front of his wife.

And now I was being told that Grandpa rest his incredibly petty and foresight heavy soul had created a trust fund that paid $100,000 a year to whoever had custody of his great grandchild. They and it like a win win. If I signed over guardianship to them, we'd all benefit. I could live rent free, focus on my career, they'd raise the baby right and I'd still get to be around a modern co parenting fairy tale. All I had to do was sign a few papers. I didn't even say no. I just said I'd think about it. That's when the pressure started. A few days later, my mom called sobbing, claimed her cancer had returned, stage 4 this time. She said there was a treatment that could save her but it wasn't covered by insurance and wow, what are the odds? It cost about $80,000 a year. Later that same day, my cousin Anika showed up out of nowhere, let herself in with an old spare key which, okay, that's its own issue and placed her Hand on my belly without asking. She looked me dead in the eye and said she deserved this baby. That she spent 7 years trying to get pregnant, IVF, miscarriages, the whole painful journey. Meanwhile, I didn't even want the baby at first. And now I was lucky. She promised my child a backyard, private school, stability, all funded by the trust, all if I just handed the baby over. Every phone call, every message that followed was laced with guilt, manipulation and syrupy tones. I was being selfish if I didn't give the baby a better life or help save my mother's. Then the final push. Mom sent me a photo of herself in a hospital bed, IV in her arm, looking pale and tragic, captioned, starting chemo tomorrow. I wish I could afford the treatment that actually works. It broke.

I was speed running Minecraft at 3:00am when someone joined my discord with no profile picture, just the username please help me 2024. Before I could kick them for the spam looking name, I heard heavy breathing and what sounded like running through trees. This wasn't a gaming headset, it was someone on their phone actually running through wood in real life. Is anyone there? Please? I need gamers. Specifically the only ones awake right now who might believe me. It was a girl, maybe 16 or 17, completely out of breath. My first instinct was to disconnect. This had to be some elaborate ARG or prank. But then I heard something that made my blood freeze. Dogs barking. Not normal barking. Police dog. I escaped from a conversion therapy camp in Utah. She gasped. I told my parents I ran away three weeks ago, but I've been locked in solitary. I stole a counselor's phone when they came to give me food. I remembered this discord server from before they took me. My chat explode. Twelve viewers suddenly became 50, then 100 as people started sharing the stream. Someone typed F A K E. But then we all heard it. A man's voice shouting in the distance. He went this way! Check sector 7! They're hunting me like an animal! She whispered. These camps are legal because parents sign custody over. If they catch me, I disappear forever. Other kids have disappeared. That's when my viewer, Kevin, a tech genius from Seattle, spoke up. Turn on your location sharing now. Screenshot and send it to the chat. She did. Middle of nowhere, Utah.

When my sister Scarlett was born just 11 months after me, our parents acted like it was a mistake. The universe had made a glitch. One daughter was all they could love. So they turned us into one. We looked nearly identical, same dark hair, same Hazel eyes, same frame. So they created a system. One month I was Sophie, their daughter. The next, Scarlet was Sophie, the one not chosen for that month. She got locked in the basement, not grounded, not time out. Basement, no windows, no light, no contact, just silence. We switched at midnight on the first of every month like clockwork. I'd hand over my clothes, backpack, bedroom, even the damn toothbrush. Mom would kiss my forehead and whisper, see you next month, stranger, like it was cute or something. Then I'd be LED downstairs like a prisoner while dad updated school records and deleted appointments. To everyone else, Sophie was just one girl, Moody, inconsistent, hard to read. In the basement, we Learned how to whisper through vents. We pass notes through tiny cracks. We coached each other on friends, crushes, homework. When Scarlet broke her arm during her month, I wore the cast. The next, when I got my first period, I had to explain how to use a tampon through a locked door. We became a two person performance of a Single Girl by the time we turned 15. So if he was no Longer me or her. She was a third person stitched together from two exhausted kids. But we made a promise one day we'd both be real. We held on to that like it was the only thing keeping us alive. And then I got sick. It's started during my off month. Horrible stomach pain, throwing up blood, couldn't even stand. Scarlet freaked out. She begged our parents to take me to the hospital. But mom just said Sophie can see a doctor during her month. When I finally switched back in, the symptoms vanished. All the tests came back clean. Doctor saw nothing. Two weeks later, Scarlet took her turn. And the second I was back in the basement, it hit again. Worse, agonizing. We realized something insane. My body only allowed itself to be sick when I wasn't Sophie, when I was invisible. The performance was so ingrained, even my body obeyed it. As soon as I could stop pretending, it broke down. We decided to confront them. We stood together in their bedroom for the first time since we were kids. I showed them the blood, the bruises, the pain. Scarlet stood beside me holding my hand.

My six year old son Marcus has hemophilia. His blood doesn't clot properly, which means even a small cut could become life threatening. The scary part, most people have no idea what hemophilia is. When Marcus was first diagnosed at 18 months, the doctors explained it like this. Imagine your body is a car but the brakes don't work. That's what his blood does when he gets injured. Normal kids get a scraped knee, flap a band Aid on it and they're fine in a few days. For Marcus, that same scrape could mean hours in the emergency room getting clotting factor injections. I Learned this the hard way. When he was 3, he bumped his head on our coffee table corner. Just a tiny bump, nothing that would even leave a Mark on most kids. But Marcus started showing signs of internal bleeding. His head was swelling. He was getting drowsy and I rushed him to the er. The doctors had to give him emergency factor V8 to stop the bleeding in his brain. That night sitting in the hospital, I realized how terrifying it was that his condition was invisible. Last year, Marcus fell off his bike and scraped his knee at the neighborhood park. A well meaning neighbor, Missus Peterson, saw the blood and immediately ran over to help. She started doing everything she'd Learned in her first aid class, applying direct pressure, elevating his leg Telling him to stay calm. What she didn't know was that with hemophilia, pressure alone doesn't work. You need special clotting medication immediately. And elevation can actually make internal bleeding worse. I was running toward them, screaming, stop, don't touch him. But she thought I was just being an overprotective parent. By the time I reached them and explained, Marcus had already been bleeding for several minutes. But the time the ambulance arrived, Marcus had lost way too much blood and needed an immediate transfusion. The paramedic later told me that if Mrs. Peterson had known about his condition from the start, they would have handled everything differently. That's when our hematologist, Doctor Rodriguez, brought up the medical tattoo idea. During our next appointment, he pulled out his laptop and showed me.

Yesterday, she gave them all back. When Heather was 18, she walked into the kitchen carrying an old Adidas shoe box and said, dad, I need to show you something. She set the box on the counter and lifted the lid. Inside were hundreds of napkins, postits, index cards. They were every lunch note I'd ever written her. You kept these, I asked. She nodded every single one. I'd started writing them when she was six. Divorce between her mom and I have been final for two months. Her mom got weekends and holidays, I got weekdays. That meant I did all the school stuff. The problem was I didn't know how to do school stuff. That first Monday of kindergarten, I packed Heather a peanut butter sandwich, apple slices and a juice box. She came home talking non stop about everyone else's lunch. Catherine's mom made sushi rolls that look like pandas and Julie's mom cut her sandwich into a butterfly with cookie. And Joyce had a note from her mom in her lunch box that said, I love you to the moon and back with a drawing of a rocket ship. Did you like your lunch, I asked. It was fine, she said, but I could tell she was envious. That night after she went to bed, I stared at her lunch bag. I couldn't make sushi. I didn't own cookie cutter, but I could write. I grabbed a Napkin and wrote, you're braver than you know. Love, dad. The next morning I tucked it under her sandwich. When she got home, she ran to hug me and said, I saw the napkin. Kelly asked if my mom wrote it and I said, no, my dad did. Nobody else's dad writes notes. I love you, dad. So I kept writing them. At first they were simple. Have a great day or you're my favorite person. Then I started adding drawings. Terrible ones. Cat that looked like a potato, a son with sunglasses. Our dog, if our dog was made of circles. My first grade, I was writing jokes. What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear. She told me her table laughed so hard the lunch monitor had to shush them. Second grade, I started writing them based on what was happening before her spelling test. You got this. Those words don't stand a chance. After she'd fought with her friend. Being kind when you're hurt is the hardest kind of brave. Sit down, Heather said that morning in the kitchen. I need to show you how I organized them. She separated them into sections with rubber bands and labeled sticky notes. The first bundle said funny. She pulled one from third grade. Why don't eggs tell jokes? It crack up. Another one had a drawing of me attempting to dance at her recital. This is still the worst drawing you've ever done, she said. Laughing. The next section was labeled Bad days. These were thicker napkin.

Now they want rights. When I adopted my best friend's son after a tragedy, my parents turned their backs on him. They called him a stranger. Now that they've Learned he's actually my biological son, they're suing me. It all started two years ago when Amanda, my best friend since college, was killed in a car accident. Drunk driver Tuesday afternoon. She died on impact. Her wife, Caroline, survived for three days in the ICU before passing, too. That left Matthew, their eight year old son, alone. Amanda had named me his godfather from day one. We were that close. She was funny, brilliant. Had this way of making every room feel lighter. I didn't think twice. I stepped in, filed for guardianship, and officially adopted Matthew a few months later. He was grieving, confused. But I was there. I always had been. My parents, they made it very clear from day one. They didn't see him as family. You're just playing house, my mom said more than once. He'll never be our grandson. My dad added, blood matters. At Christmas, they brought gifts for my two other kids. Kept Matthew entirely. When he asked about his present, they told him it was still coming. It never came. On his birthday, nothing. They sent cards to the real grandchildren. Not even a text for Matthew. Then last month, they called, wanted to discuss their will. And I quote, we're leaving everything to you and your Biological children only. That adopted boy gets nothing. We're not letting strangers inherit family money. I was stunned and furious. Matthew had lost everything. His mom, his home, his sense of safety. And they wanted to kick Kim while he was down. Blood is blood, my mom said. He's not ours. And that's when I laughed. See, there's something they never knew. Eight years ago, Amanda and Caroline were trying to have a child. Years of fertility treatments, miscarriages, and heartbreak. Caroline couldn't carry the term. Amanda called me crying one night, her voice shaking. Would you do it? She asked. Would you be our donor? I didn't even hesitate. We kept it private. I signed over my rights. Legally, Amanda wanted to be Matthew's legal mom. She and Caroline were his only parents. On paper, I was Uncle Paul. Always around, always involved, but never interfering. It was our agreement. But when Amanda and Caroline died, I needed legal proof for the adoption.

I told him his mom outed me to them back when attitudes were different, but that she probably wouldn't do something like that now. He got real quiet after that and change the subject to some video game or whatever. Next day, my phone's blowing up. My sister's absolutely losing her mind, screaming at me about poisoning her kid against the family. She's saying I'm making up homophobia accusations and dragging up old drama.

Six years ago when I started at this company, there wasn't even a marketing team, just me in a corner cubicle trying to figure out social media campaigns, email marketing by myself. After my first year, my boss approached me, we want to expand marketing. You interested in building a department? Of course, I said yes. For two years, I was a one person army, creating strategies, running campaigns, analyzing data, everything. My numbers were so good that my manager actually asked the boss to give me a bonus. Then the company grew and they finally gave me a team. Three new hires that I personally trained from day one. I taught them our systems, our client preferences, our campaign strategies, basically everything I'd Learned through trial and error over four years. But here's the kicker, my title never changed. Still marketing agent after all this time. I brought this up to my manager multiple times. We'll see what we can do was always the response. Then came the meeting that changed everything. My manager calls me in and says, the boss thinks we need an official team lead position. I'm thinking finally recognition for what I've been doing all along. Who do you think it'll be? I asked, already knowing the answer. Well, you started the department, you trained everyone. You have the most experience. I walked out of that meeting on cloud nine. Six years of hard work was finally paying off. Two weeks later, another meeting. We've decided to hire externally for the team lead position. I swear my heart stopped internally, but I've been doing the job for years. The boss just couldn't see you in that leadership role. Those words hit like a punch to the gut. Couldn't see me in leadership. I've been leading this team since before it existed. I've been making all the strategic decisions, training new hires, managing client relationships. What exactly did leadership look like to them? They hired someone with zero experience at our company, zero understanding of our processes, our clients.

For a second, I thought she was joking. Katie had always been dramatic, making everything sound worse than it was. But then I saw her face. She wasn't laughing. I put down my sandwich. What did you just say? She took a shaky breath. Mike and I, we've been seeing each other. It started when you were visiting your mom in the hospital. My mom had been in the ICU for two weeks. Katie drove me there every single day because Mike said he had to work late. You're lying, I whispered. She pulled out her phone and showed me a text thread, messages going back 6 months, pictures I didn't want to see, hotel receipts, even a video of them in my own kitchen while I was at work. I felt sick. Katie, we've been best friends since second grade. I know. That's why I had to tell you. I can't keep lying. But here's the thing about Katie. She always wanted what I had. In high school, she dated my ex the day after we broke up. In college, she applied to the same job I wanted and told them I was unreliable. When I got engaged, he suddenly started dating Mike's brother. I should have seen this coming. I stood up from the table. How long were you. Planning to keep this up? We didn't plan it. It just happened. Nothing just happens. Katie, you made a choice. Every single time she started crying. I'm sorry. I know I messed up, but I really love him. That's when something clicked. Mike had been acting weird for months, coming home late, showering as soon as he walked in, putting his phone face down. He said he was stressed about work, but his company wasn't even busy. I drove home and found Mike in our garage working on his motorcycle. He looked up and smiled like nothing was wrong. Hey, babe, how was lunch with Katie? I almost laughed. She told me about you two. His wrench slipped and clanged on the floor. What? She showed me everything. Mike. The texts, the pictures, the hotel.

Sarah always thought she had life figured out. Perfect husband, perfect house, perfect pregnancy announcements with matching outfits and Pinterest worthy nursery reveals. Meanwhile, I was the family screw up who couldn't even keep a goldfish alive past week two. Still single at 28, working retail, living in a studio apartment. At every family gathering, Sarah would parade little Emma around like a designer accessory. Professional photos every month, elaborate birthday parties posted across three social media platforms. But the moment Emma got fussy or needed a diaper change, guess who got handed the screaming baby? You're so good with kids, Sarah would coo, already reaching for her phone to capture another mommy moment. When Emma started talking, Sarah would correct her constantly, that's Auntie, not Mama. Mama's right here, sweetheart. But Emma kept reaching for me during family dinners, sobbing when Sarah tried to take her back. Sarah's Instagram smile would get tighter each time the passive aggressive comments started ramping up. Some people just aren't meant to be mothers, she'd whisper at Christmas, watching me fumble with Emma's complicated car seat. You can barely manage your own life. What would you do with real responsibility? I bit my tongue because I desperately needed the babysitting money. Yeah, my perfect sister paid me to watch Emma every weekend while she attended her exclusive book club. Fifty bucks for Saturday morning until Sunday night. Easy money for someone drowning in student loans. And honestly, Emma was actually sweet when she wasn't being used as a photo prop. But here's what Sarah didn't know. Her fancy book club was actually romantic weekend getaways with Marcus, her personal trainer. I started piecing it together when Emma began having meltdowns. Every time I arrived to Saturday mornings, she'd run to me crying, Mama! Mama! Then point to framed pictures of Sarah and clearly say, Sarah! That's when the devastating truth hit me. Emma had been spending more time with me than her actual mother for the past eight months. Every milestone, every fever scare, every patient attempt at teaching her to use a spoon, I was there. Sarah just swooped in for pickups and Instagram photo sessions. Breaking point came last Tuesday. Sarah showed up three hours early, probably rushing off to another yoga retreat with Marcus. She let herself in, expecting to find us quietly playing. Instead, she walked into my apartment to find Emma sprinting toward the door, chubby arms stretched wide, screaming with joy, Mama's home! Mama's home! Sarah's face drained of all color, she stood frozen in my doorway, watching her daughter tackle hug my legs while babbling excitedly about the cookies we'd bake together. She doesn't know the difference, Sarah stammered, forcing a shaky laugh. Kids this age get so confused. Actually, I said calmly, pulling out my phone.

So I'm 14 and I was babysitting my little sister Kenna, who just turned four. Her dad got her this bright pink bike with training wheels and she was super pumped to try it out at Riverside Park. It's like this tiny neighborhood park with a playground and some bike paths where all the local families hang out. We got there around three PM and there was already this mom there with her three kids, two boys who looked maybe 7 and 9, and a girl around my sister's age. The mom was sitting on one of those metal picnic benches scrolling on her phone while her kids ran wild. I made eye contact with her when we walked up and gave her a friendly wave because that's what my mom taught me to do. Kenna was so excited. She kept saying, I'm gonna be fast like dad Eddie over and over. But after about 15 minutes on the bike, she got scared and wanted to go on the swings instead. She parked her bike right next to the swing set and ran over. I was pushing her when my Uncle Trevor drove by in his work truck, lives like two blocks away and always stops to chat when he sees us. I turned around to wave at him through his window and when I looked back, Kenna was crying and pointing at her bike. The two boys had grabbed it and Were taking turns riding it around the path. The little girl was standing next to them cheering them on. I walked over and said, hey, guys, can you please give the bike back? My sister wants to use it now. But they completely ignored me and kept riding. The older boy even did this little wheelie thing that made Kenna cry harder. So I went up to their mom and said, excuse me, could you please ask your sons to give my sister's bike back? She'd like to ride it now. Woman barely looked up from her phone and said, my kids are having fun and yours isn't using it, so I don't see the problem. I felt my face get hot, but I stayed calm and said, I understand they're having fun, but it's her bike and your kids brought their own bikes, so could they please use those instead? That's when this lady completely lost it. He stood up and started going off about how I had no business telling her how to parent when I was clearly too young to be getting girls pregnant. She kept saying my sister was obviously my daughter and that I was some teenage dad who had no right to lecture anyone. I was so confused and angry I could barely think straight. My sister was still crying by the swings and this woman was calling me a teen dad in front of everyone at the park. A few other parents had Stopped what they were doing to stare at us. I snapped and said, lady, she's my sister and I think I have the right to ask nicely when you're being a complete bitch about it. So I'm going to ask one more time. Are you going to tell your little rats to get off my sister's bike or not? Her face went bright red and she.

So I'm 23 and my parents came here from another country when I was little. They drilled it into my head that you always bring something when you visit someone's house. Doesn't matter if it's your best friend or some random person you barely know. You bring a gift. It's just what you do. My boyfriend Jake and I have been together for almost four years. We both work from home. So when his parents suggested we do weekly dinners at their place, I was totally down for it. I love his parents. They're super sweet and always make this amazing lasagna that's literally better than any restaurant. Every single week for like three months, I'd bring something small, a bottle of wine from the grocery store, some cookies from that bakery downtown, flowers from the farmers market. Nothing expensive, just little things to say thanks for cooking for us. His mom would always smile and put whatever I brought on the kitchen counter and his dad would give me this little nod like he appreciated it. Last Tuesday, I found these perfect daffodils at the store. His mom mentioned once that they reminded her of spring. So I grabbed a small bouquet for like eight bucks. I was putting them in a little vase when Jake completely lost it. Why do you keep bringing stuff over every week? Like my parents are some charity case? He Said throwing his jacket on aggressively. I literally had no idea what he was talking about. What do you mean? I've always done this, even when we go to your friend's houses. Remember? That's when he really went off. Stop imposing your culture on everyone. It's weird because you're white anyway, so just stop. I felt like I'd been slapped. I handed him the flowers and told him to go to dinner without me. I needed to walk around the block like five times just to process what had just happened. When he got back two hours later, he still had the flowers. He set them on our coffee table and sat down with the serious look. Look, I'm sorry for snapping, but my parents are actually super annoyed with you constantly bringing stuff. They think you're treating them like they can't take care of themselves or something. Before I could even respond, my phone buzzed. Text from his dad. Hi, honey. Maybe it's best if you don't come to dinner anymore. Nothing personal. I stared at that message for like 10 minutes. These people who I thought loved having me over, who always seemed happy to see me, had been talking about me behind my back this whole time. Jake was sitting there waiting for me to apologize like I'd done something horrible. I was just trying to be polite. I finally said, well, it came across wrong. You need to call them and apologize if you want to. Fix this. Here's the thing. I wasn't sorry. Not really. I was raised to show gratitude when someone feeds you. My mom would have been mortified if I showed up to someone's house empty handed. It's not about charity or thinking someone can't take care of themselves. It's about respect. Next few days were brutal. Jake barely talked to me unless it was to bring up the apology again. He'd make these little comments about how stubborn I was being, how I was choosing my weird cultural hangups over his family. Finally, I called his mom.

I'm white, my wife Monica is black, and we've got two kids. Our son Tyler is five, and our daughter, Emma, is three. When Tyler was born, we'd only been together about a year. Monica got pregnant, and we got married because of it. But honestly, we ended up actually happy together. But Tyler never looked like me. Not even a little bit. Came out way darker than Monica. And he just didn't have any of those features you'd expect from a mixed kid. My mom would make these comments, like, are you sure he's yours? And my dad would just give me these looks at family dinners, even my friends started asking questions. I tried to ignore it, but it was eating at me. When Emma was born two years later, everything changed. She looked exactly like me. Same blue eyes, same nose, even the same dimple on her left cheek. Suddenly, I understood what it felt like to look at your kid and know they're yours without a doubt. It was this crazy, instant connection that I never had with Tyler. That's when the doubt really kicked in. I started noticing how my family treated Emma differently. More pictures, more attention, more everything. And I realized I was doing it, too. I was trying to love Tyler the same way. But there was always this voice in my head going, what if he's not yours? Four months ago, I couldn't take it anymore. I took Tyler to get ice cream and swabbed his cheek while he was distracted. Sent it off to one of those DNA places. Two weeks later, the results came back. He's mine. 100% mine. I actually cried reading that email. Everything changed after that. I felt this huge weight lift off my shoulders. I started really bonding with Tyler in a way I never had before. We started doing dad's son stuff together. Playing catch in the backyard, building Lego sets. Monica kept commenting on how much closer we seemed. He had no idea why things were going so well that we started talking about having a third kid. That's when I screwed up. Last week, I told Monica about the test. I thought she'd understand. I mean, Tyler really doesn't look like me at all. I figured she'd be relieved that we finally had proof. She lost her mind. Started yelling about how I didn't trust her, how I treated Tyler differently because he's darker. She asked if I ever doubted Emma was mine. And when I said no, she called me racist. That hurt, because it's not about race. It's about knowing your kid is yours. Then she said something that really got to me. She said Tyler probably felt my distance all these years. That I made him feel unloved for no reason. I told her that was bullshit, because I always treated him like my son. Even When I had doubts. But thinking back, maybe she's right. Maybe kids pick up on that stuff more than we think. It's been two weeks now, and Monica's barely talking to me. She's sleeping in the guest room and only speaks to me about kids stuff.

I've been playing guitar for about 22 years now. I know my way around vintage stuff pretty well, especially old Telecasters and Stratocasters. You've been in the game this long, you can spot valuable gear from a mile away. So my wife Amy was hanging out with her coworkers after work one day and she mentioned I played guitar. This guy named Trevor, who apparently was super popular at her office, his dad had just died and he was selling off his stuff. His dad had this guitar he wanted to get rid of and he asked Amy if I'd be interested. Amy texted me about it when she got home and I told her to have him send me some pictures and the price. The next day, Trevor sent me these photos of what looked like a 1952 Telecaster in absolutely mint condition. I'm talking no scratches, original hardware, even had the original receipt from the music store. This was insane. I texted back asking what he wanted for it and he said he'd looked up telecasters online and thought $4,000 was fair. My heart literally stopped. This guitar was worth at least 50 grand, maybe more. With that paperwork, I immediately texted back, I'll take it for 4,000. And we arranged to meet. When I picked up the guitar, Trevor seemed pretty casual about the Whole thing. He said it had no sentimental value to him at all. He just needed the money. I paid him in cash, shook his hand and drove home, trying not to speed with $50,000 sitting in my passenger seat. When I got home and told Amy what it was actually worth, she freaked out. She couldn't believe someone would sell a guitar worth that much for $4,000. But I reminded her that Trevor had done his own research and set his own price. I didn't lie to him or hide anything. Two weeks later, Amy comes home from work looking stressed. He said Trevor had found out what the guitar was really worth from some family friend who knew about vintage guitars. He wanted it back. Amy told him, I really like the guitar and that I knew it was worth 50,000, which is why I was shocked he offered it for four grand. She said she doubted I'd sell it back, but he could ask. That night, Trevor called me. He started off polite, saying he made a mistake with the pricing and wanted to buy it back. I told him the guitar wasn't for sale. That's when he got nasty, said I'd scammed him and that he was going to sue me and take Amy to HR. For being part of some scheme. The next day, he actually did contact HR. Thankfully, Amy's company stayed out of it. They told Trevor this was between him and me. Not a workplace issue, but that didn't stop him from making Amy's life miserable. Every single day. He'd corner her about the guitar. He'd ask her to text me, convince me to guilt trip me about his dead dad. Amy came home crying one day because he'd gotten really aggressive, saying I was a thief and that Amy was helping me steal from grieving families. She filed a complaint with HR about harassment. They gave Trevor a warning, but he didn't stop. A week later, he followed Amy to her car and started yelling at her in the parking lot, calling her names and saying he knew where we lived. That's when Amy filed a second complaint.

Look, being a mom is hard enough without people acting like that's all you are. But my in laws took it to a whole new level. From the second I had my first kid, I stopped being Carmen. I was just Mama to them. Not in the cute way either. Like they completely forgot I had a name. It started small. Christmas shopping became a nightmare because everything they bought me had some stupid mom saying on it. Mama needs coffee, mugs, wine, o'clock for mommy shirts. Meanwhile, my husband got actual presents, a new fishing reel, concert tickets, tools for his workshop, real human being gifts. But calling me Mama constantly was what really got under my skin. We'd walk into their house and it was, how's Mama doing? And Mama looks tired and does Mama want some tea? I'm standing right there. I have a name. Use it. The worst part was watching them treat my husband completely different. He was still Jake to them, still got invited to guy trips and asked about his job and hobbies. But me, I was just the walking uterus who produced their grandkids. I tried dropping hints at first when his sister Amy would say, Mama's here, I joke, Carmen's here too. But nobody got it or they pretended not to. I started correcting them more directly, it's Carmen actually. But they Just laugh it off like I was being silly. The breaking point was last Christmas. We've been there maybe 20 minutes when Amy handed me a gift, another mommy's little helper wine glass. I looked over at Jake opening his present, expensive noise cancelling headphones he'd mentioned wanting months ago. Thanks, I said, holding up the stupid glass. But you know my name is Carmen, right? Amy did that fake confused face. Of course. Silly, but you're such a good mama. That's when I snapped. I'm not just a mom, though. Why does Jake get real presents while I get wine? Mom garbage. Why does he get called by his name while I'm just mama to everyone? I have interests. I have a personality. I exist outside of being your grandkids mom. The room went dead quiet. My mother in law grabbed my hand and squeezed it saying she was sorry and she never thought about it that way. For a second, I thought maybe I'd finally gotten through to them. Then Amy's sisters jumped in. Lisa started with that fake concerned voice asking if I was okay, if I needed to talk to someone, making me sound crazy for being upset. Katie went straight for the throat asking if being a mom was somehow beneath me. I thought I was better than them. That's not what I'm saying at all, I shot back. I'm saying I'm a person with a name and an identity beyond just being a mom. Jake doesn't stop being Jake when he became a dad. Why should I stop being Carmen? But they weren't hearing it. Katie kept going about how blessed I should feel and how ungrateful I sounded. Lisa kept doing the whole, you seem really angry. This isn't healthy thing that people do when they want to shut you up. My mother in law tried to calm everyone down, but the damage was done. The rest of Christmas was awkward as hell. Every time someone almost called me Mama, they'd catch themselves and say my name in this overly dramatic way like they were doing me some huge favor.

I'm getting really worried. I asked my FA favorite astrology app, Astro App, for advice and it said that I'm a cancer, so I can get really emotional when I feel abandoned.

I keep hoping you'll walk through the door before she's born. Ello, it's been two years. I know that sounds insane, but part of me still thinks you're coming back. I can't move on from this. Everyone tells me to, but I can't. It's like a piece of me went missing with you. Hey. I need to tell you this. I'm getting married. I found someone who loves me. I think you'd like him. He's the love of my life. And I'm finally getting married. I asked for star rings so you'd be here with me in some way. I miss you more than ever right now. Ilio. It's been five years. I don't know what to say anymore. But I'm still here. They closed your case, the police. No one's looking for you anymore. But I'll never stop. I'm thinking of searching for you on my own, but in secret. Oh, and I'm pregnant. It's a boy. I'm naming him Elio, after you. Hey. Wow. I didn't even realize we're still having this conversation. It's been seven years. My son's been born. Look. I think he looks a bit like you. He's as cute as you were. Or maybe that's just me imagining things. Wish you could see him. Hey, Elio. It's been 11 years. He's turning four. Today. Time flies, doesn't it? Feels like yesterday when I last saw you. He really admires you, you know. I always tell him how great you were as a boyfriend. He says you're still alive, that we're so connected. That's why I feel like you're still around. But I don't know. Sometimes I lose faith in you coming back. I wonder if he's right. I still feel you somehow, Ello. It's been 14 years. My new boyfriend tells me I need to move on. Says I'm holding on too tight. But my son, he still believes you're coming back. He's only a kid, but he has more faith than I do by now. It's been 20 years, Elio. Wow. My boy's nine now. He's getting so big. And guess what? I'm pregnant again. With a girl. She's due in four months, and I'm naming her Jula. Like your sister. Speaking of, your sister moved back in with your parents. She's not doing well. She barely speaks to anyone. It's like everything fell apart when you left. Elio, it's been 25 years. I built the house we dreamed of. Remember that? I also got divorced, though. He cheated on me. Now it's just me, Elio, Julia and the cat. Still waiting for you, I guess. I miss you more than I can put into words, Elio. You have no idea. Every single day. Bria. The fuck you mean I died? I was just having some burger and fries. You're already planning My funeral. Chill. You can now check part two by pressing share. Then more.

Womp, womp. What do you mean, womp, womp? You don't even care. She was your girlfriend for two years, Justin. She loved you for two years. Listen, Tammy, this is not my problem. She overreacted and did something irrational. That's on her, not me. Justin, you literally broke her heart. How could you after the two years of her being there for you? When big sis Jessica passed away, that hurt us bad. And she was there for you, making sure you were okay. When you couldn't take me to school because you were too sad to get out of the bed, Emma came to take me. She would always take care of me, like how our big sister would before she passed. She would always buy me food, pack my lunch, and would even come over to watch me and take care of me when nobody was home. She would stay home with me just to play Barbies with me, to make sure I wasn't scared being alone. She was the best girlfriend you ever had. She was the sister I needed after big sis passed away. And now you're the reason why Emma is gone. Because you were selfish and cheated. I don't have time to read a lot. Go cry to someone else. Leave me be. One day you will see. You lost the best thing you had. Stop talking to me, mom. I still can't believe she's gone. I couldn't stop Crying after seeing her in the casket. I know, baby. It broke all of our hearts. We lost a beautiful soul that day. She was the perfect daughter I never asked for. Always taking care of us like she was a part of this family. We will miss her forever. Yeah, everyone will miss her. Except Justin. Justin is so evil. How could he do that to her? I talked to your brother, Tammy, and what he did was absolutely terrible and unforgivable. He should be grounded forever. Sadly, I can't do anything since he's a 20 year old man. Mommy, I really think this is my fault. If I would have just shut my mouth, Emma would still be here. But I decided to be a loud mouth. This is all because of me. Baby. No, you did the right thing. Don't ever feel bad about doing the right thing. Yeah. Mommy, could you at least take me to see Emma again? I miss her so much. I want to play Barbies with her. I wish I could, Tammy, but I'm so tired and I have work tomorrow. Auntie, can you send me a rizz app line so mommy can take me? This will for sure make mommy smile. Say this. My love for you will give you all the energy you need. My love for you will give you all the energy you need. Oh, that's so sweet. You're right. I do have enough energy for one more Trip, meet me at the car. Yay! I'm bringing my Barbies! I'm bringing my new Barbies to come play with you. Emma, I miss you so much. You were the best thing I had in my life. I will never forget you. And I'll keep that promise that we made at your grave that I will come play Barbies with you every single day. I love you so much. Mommy, when will you be back from work? I have to go see Emma again today so we can play Barbies. Yesterday was so fun with her. I was so happy I could spend time with her. Sorry, baby. I won't be able to make it home on time because of this snowstorm. But, Mommy, I made a promise to Emma that I would never miss a day. I'm so sorry, Tammy, but I can't today. Don't be sorry, Mommy. I won't break my promise to Emma. Wait, honey, what do you mean by that? Tammy? Justin, where is Tammy? I don't know. Why are you asking me? You didn't watch over your little sister. I looked over the entire house, and she's not here. And that's my problem. How? Oh, my god. I think she went to Emma's grave. Wait, how would she even be able to walk all the way over there by herself in the snow? No time for questions. Get in your car and drive to the cemetery now. Whatever. Did you find anything, Justin? I looked Around and found nothing. Oh, my god, not my Tammy! Well, actually, I did find this one thing. Two Frozen Barbies in front of Emma's Tombstone. Oh, my god, no!

My parents weren't like abusive or anything, but they were super strict. I'm talking no social media, no hanging out with friends on school nights, and my phone had to be turned in at nine PM every night. Literally medieval torture for a teenage girl. The final straw came after this huge fight about my grades. I've been struggling in math, always hated it, still do tbh and got a D on my report card. My parents flipped. They took my phone for a month, banned me from seeing my friends, and made me spend weekends doing extra math worksheets instead of anything fun. I was texting with my best friend Charlotte at school about how unfair it was and she was like just come stay with me for a few days, my parents won't care. Her family was mad chill compared to mine. Her mom let her have boys in her room with the door closed. I was jealous AF so I decided to run away. Now I wasn't completely stupid. I knew I couldn't just disappear forever. I was thinking like a 3 4 day protest to show my parents they were being unreasonable. Maybe they'd realise how much they missed me and stop being so strict. I packed a backpack with like the Absolute Essentials. Three t shirts, my favourite hoodie, a pair of jeans, some underwear, my school makeup bag, and like $43 I'd saved from Birthday money. I also took this silver necklace my grandma gave me that I thought I could maybe sell if I needed more cash. Teen logic lol. I waited until everyone was asleep, probably around 1:00am. Our house had this super creepy wooden hallway, I literally practiced walking through it for weeks before I ran away, finding exactly where to step to avoid making noise. I felt like a ninja that night, swear to god. The plan was to walk to this 24 hour convenience store about a mile away and call Charlotte to come get me. But here's where everything went sideways. Charlotte's phone was dead. Like completely off. No response. I tried calling her house phone. Yes, they still had one, but her dad answered and I panicked and hung up. So there I was, sitting outside the 7 11 at 2:00am, no ride, and starting to low key freak out. The guy working inside kept giving me weird looks through the window. I was just sitting on the curb trying to figure out what to do when this red sedan pulls up. There were two guys and a girl, probably college age. The girl rolled down her window and asked if I was okay. I must have looked pathetic AF because she immediately offered me a ride. Her name was Melissa and she seems super nice, telling me they were coming back from a party and could drop me somewhere. Now I know this sounds dumb Don't get in cars with strangers and all that. But teenage me was desperate. It was getting cold, and I figured having a girl there made it safer. Plus, Melissa had this really gentle voice and kept saying she just wanted to help. I told them I needed to get to Charlotte's house, but didn't have her exact address. Another brilliant part of my plan. The guys were talking quietly in the front seat while Melissa kept asking me questions. How old I was, why I was out so late, if my parents knew where I was. I started noticing we weren't going towards Charlotte's neighborhood at all. We were heading towards the highway when I pointed this out. The guy driving, Steve, I think, said they needed to make a quick stop first. That's when the alarm bells really started going off in my head. Melissa kept trying to keep me calm, saying they just needed to drop something off with a friend, and then they'd help me find Charlotte's house. But then the other guy, Benjamin

How's it going? Um, hi. Who's this? I can't tell you that, but I go to your school. We've never talked, but I've had a crush on you since middle school. If you had a crush on me for so long, why have we never spoken? Because I'm scared. And I don't know if you would feel the same way. Why don't we play a game? Okay. What kind of game? You have until July to figure out who I am. Is this an excuse to get me to talk to you for the whole year? Pretty much. Why not? I do need to let you know I already have a crush on a girl in my school, so don't get your hopes up. That's fine. Let's see what happens. Hey. You looked hot today. You were watching me? It's kind of weird. Rizz app respond with how could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? How could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? Wow. That actually made me feel good. At least give me clues about yourself. Why? So I can at least get a starting point on who you are. Fine. I am blonde. That doesn't help me. There are lots of blonde girls in our school. Be more specific. I have a birthmark on my neck, so I have to go check every blonde girl's neck. Ha ha. So tell me about this girl you Like her name is Violet. She's perfect. We have never spoken. Sadly. Do you know her? Violet? Oops, sorry. I do know her. Maybe when I find out who you are, you can introduce me to her. You can ask her right now and she will say yes. How can you be so sure? I'm too scared to ask her. Don't worry. She is nice. Okay. Good night, mystery girl. I'm going to get some sleep. Good night. What? I don't get a message today. Ah. Does someone miss me? In your dreams. I was just surprised how my crush since middle school hadn't messaged me today. I have a question for you. Or ask away. How could you have loved me for so long if we haven't spoken ever? You are handsome. The way you talk to people. You are such a kind soul. Polite. You make everyone laugh. You are a gentleman. I always knew you are what I always wanted. Now I really wanna know who you are. Patience. Hey. Hey. Can I admit something to you? Sure. I'm not interested in Violet anymore. Really? How come? She's beautiful. So beautiful that I was too scared to even go near her. That's the issue. She's perfect in every way. But I have fallen for someone else. Someone who I do speak to. Someone who understands me. Someone without a name or a face, but someone who loves me. The day you find out who I am, I Hope we will be together. Me too. Mystery girl. Can I confess something to you? Sure. What's up? I think it's time to tell you who I am. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

These yns had crowbars, pickaxes, all type of shit to break through shit to get what they wanted. What's even more crazy is like, they was on a time limit. Like, there was a leader of the group letting them know when it was time to go. Now, what they didn't know is that this place was robbed almost two years ago. So they put security measures in place, which they quickly found out when they was trying to exit the stove. But one brilliant individual said, I got this shit. We out of here. Even though 25 people was involved, seven people was arrested, ranging from ages 17 to 31. A newly acquired drone was able to get video footage of the suspects fleeing and going what direction?

In a panic, he tried to sail away, but his anchor was stuck on something, preventing him from leaving. Taking matter into his own hands, he dove down to his anchor and tried moving the object himself. But the object he found was much different than he could ever imagine. It was a giant, shiny, weird looking White Rock. And at first he thought nothing of it, carrying it back to his boat because he thought it looked cool. Sailing back home and stuffing the rock under his bed, completely unaware of what he just found. Fast forwarding an entire 10 whole years later, his house caught on fire, burning down half of his house, forcing him to move. But while he was taking out everything that survived, he rediscovered the giant White Rock, finally deciding to bring it to a local tourist office, hoping they knew what it was.

First, ravens and wolves work together to hunt, where ravens will fly around looking for prey, then flying back to the wolves, getting their attention and leading them to the animal they saw waiting for the kill and sharing the meal. Next, hermit crabs and an enemy basically team up together to survive. Since an enemy can't move fast, the crab will pick it up and equipped it on its shell. The enemy helps defend the crab with its stinging tentacles, while the crab gives it much faster transportation and also shares scraps of its food every time it eats. Next, coyotes and Badgers hunt together. Since coyotes are better at covering ground and Badgers are better underground. The coyote will chase the prey on land, and if it goes under, the badger will take over, leaving the prey with no options. Are ways to escape, sharing their meal. Finally, humans and wild dolphins in Brazil work together to catch fish. The dolphins will find a school of fish and herd them towards the fisherman. When the fish are close, the dolphin will slap the water with its tail, signalling the fisherman to cast the net, causing the fish to scatter and get disorientated so it's easier for the dolphins to catch, rewarding both of them.

First off, honey Badgers are extremely aggressive, where no matter what size you are, they will challenge you. Known to have an extremely strong bite force targeting your most vulnerable areas like your eyes, throat, or even your balls. But it doesn't stop there, as honey Badgers are pretty much mini tanks, doing things like fighting deadly snakes, passing out from the venom, then waking up to finish the job, ignoring pain and injuries, constantly fighting no matter what, or taking on multiple animals by itself. And even if you were to get a good bite off on a honey badger, they have extremely loose skin and will twist inside of their own body just to bite your face. So if you do somehow kill a honey badger, there's still no doubt it'll leave you mangled for life.

The first step is during mating season, where the male penguin will search the crowd looking for a female he likes. Once he has a crush, he'll remember their face going out on a mission looking for the most perfect pebble he can find. When searching, they try to look for ones that are smooth, shiny, have a flat surface, and are clean. Once they find the special rock, the penguin will carry it in their beak all the way back to their crush, where it all comes down to a moment of truth, at which the male penguin will simply walk up to the female and lay the stone down at her feet. If she doesn't pick up the rock, that means she's not interested or already taken, which can cause the male to panic, constantly dropping more pebbles hoping she changes her mind. Or sometimes their mate might see this and attack the other penguin. But on the other hand, if she does pick up the pebble, it's a yes. Where they will then spend the next few days building a nest together, then raising an entire family for months until they grow up continuously mating each other over and over again every single mating season.

This is the last picture of Anna before I lost her. She was 2 and this is what she would look like now. Who did this? Peter Carson. My Pi has a forensic artist who specializes in age progression photography. You know it's Anna, don't you? The girl in the park is my baby. Actually, Mrs. Osborne, we checked. NYPD has no record of Anna as missing or abducted. Mrs. Osborne, state police to. And how did this abduction happen? Anna and my husband Steve were on their way to visit Steve's parents in Morristown. She was taken from a rest area in the turnpike. Can we talk to Steve? She was killed in a car accident. How did you find Patty Branson? I saw her at the playground about three weeks ago. I used to take Anna there. So I go sometimes to see the kids. You know, every day I have prayed that I find Anna. Everywhere I go, I look for her. I see a little girl with Anna's smile. When Michelle saw the girl on the swing, until the second her heart, I saw that little girl on the swing and she immediately called the police. However, Michelle's call was. With all due respect, Mrs. Osborne, a feeling is not enough. Detectives are questioning as the conversation continues. Mother knows. What did you do when you saw Patty? I called the police. You people thought I was crazy. You're making a mistake. No, Michelle, the judge warned you and you wouldn't listen. Get out of here. Get away from us. Why can't you leave us alone? She's my daughter. I gave birth to her. She's, she's not gonna bother you anymore because Michelle is going to jail. She is wrong, Michelle. This is gotta stop now. Okay? We know everything. Anna was on the police report from your husband's accident. She died in the car with him. No, they never found her remains, Michelle. They were hit by a gasoline tank. Now, there was nothing left. I'm sorry, but you know what I'm telling you is the truth. I know my daughter is alive. Olivia, go look what I found. That guy doesn't give up. Where'd you find him? Around the corner. He's not too smart. Pete, your bail's history piece of paper in my pocket. Read it and weep. What is it? It's a lab report. They tested the air from Patty Branson for DNA. So what does it say? Patty's Michelle Osbourne's daughter.

The man donated his body to science. Yes, it's a tragedy. If I hadn't shot him, his body could have spent the next year letting first year med students use the carpool lane. He said do not turn that on house. You're mad because I put a bullet in his head. The worst. All I'm doing now is taking it out.

And they turned Jenna into a joke. When Emma and Jenna are together, Emma dresses conservatively. She even refuses to let Emma touch her. But when she's with hunter at events, she puts on a deep V gown. On top of that, hunter always keeps a full foot of distance from Jenna. He even avoids eye contact with her. But the moment he sees Emma, he lights up like a bee spotting honey. His hand is practically glued to Emma's waist. Going down the stairs, he pretends he's just worried she'll fall, but his eyes scan her entire body. During interviews, he even strokes Emma's arm, and Emma instinctively covers her chest. A lot of people say they're just sisters, but don't forget hunter is still a man, and he's had girlfriends before. That girl was Grace, whose photos hunter never made public. They were college classmates. Interestingly, it's Grace who made hunter realize he also liked men. She took him to watch will and Grace in 2,015. He finally met Fielder Jewitt on Tinder. Five years later, they got engaged, but fielder was insecure and didn't want hunter in intimate scenes. After Wednesday premiered, he smashed things over Hunter's kiss with Jenna. So a month later, they rushed into a wedding. And now hunter and Emma are inseparable. Do you think this kind of behavior is appropriate?

Where'd you get $75 from? My savings account, how are we supposed to save anything if you keep taking money out? I need money to buy a new outfit for Christmas picture day. But if you don't think that I can do it, then fine. Translation, how come you always put me down? It's not that I, I just don't want all these women hanging out over here running their mouth, eating our food and wasting your time. It's not gonna be a waste of time, alright?

Well, there's no apartments here. Alright. They fix vacuum cleaners. Any luck tracking a number? Yeah, Tara's on. It looks like a burner. So fake address, burner cell. Little kid with a loaded gun and a goodbye note from the mother. Man, it sounds like this honor is either involved with the dealer or she's a prostitute on the run. Maybe her son's better off at social services. That note she left sure seems like she loves him. Sometimes loving ain't enough.

The wildfire had shifted direction, and it was barreling straight toward the village. But instead of rushing to put it out, he struck a match. He watched the flame crawl down to his fingers and realized this fire was way beyond control. He immediately ordered the villagers to evacuate in an orderly way. But nobody took him seriously. They'd rather soak their houses with water than leave. As the fire closed in, panic finally set in and people started to flee. But by then, the main road was already blocked by roaring flames. As fire air chief, he knew time was running out. There was only one rescue helicopter, so women and children had to go first. The rest would have to cut through the forest and reach a river four kilometers away. But the car was too heavy. The helicopter just didn't have the lift. They had to shed 200 kilos of weight. With no other choice, the mothers tearfully said goodbye to their kids. And with a pilot giving it everything he had, the chopper finally lifted off. Thick smoke turned day into night. The kids sat frozen in fear. Sam tried to calm them down, but then one of the ropes suddenly snapped. The car swung violently, and the kids screamed in terror. Suddenly, the pilot spotted a clearing, dropped down, and scrambled to get the kids aboard. In the middle of the chaos, Sam leapt out, unhooked the rope, and Rushed the kids onto the helicopter. When the pilot tried to lift off again, the bird wouldn't move. No matter how hard he pulled. It was useless. They had to lose even more weight. So Sam started tossing out everything. Tools, bags, even fire extinguishers. He even threw away his favorite guitar, but it still wasn't enough. Out of options, Sam told the pilot to dump a ton of fuel, since they still had the backup tank. Then he grabbed a fire extinguisher to fight off the nearby flames, buying just a few precious seconds. Finally, everyone piled onto the helicopter. But it hovered barely two meters off the ground. Still not enough lift. So Sam stripped off his shoes, even his clothes. But it made no difference. With the fire about to reach the spilled fuel, Sam made a final choice. He told the kids to shut their eyes and said, when I count to three, a miracle will happen. One. Two. Three! And somehow, a miracle did happen. The helicopter rose into the air. When the kids opened their eyes, Sam was gone. To save their lives, he had jumped out. Standing in the firelight, Sam showed no fear. And then the raging inferno, like a pack of wild beasts, swallowed him whole. Meanwhile, the fire chief was leading the villagers on a desperate escape toward the river. On the way, they watched their homes vanish into the flames, their grief written on their faces. But they had No choice. They had to keep moving. Soon they were trapped again. Even the battle hardened chief was stunned. Thankfully, the river was only 300 meters away. The chief made a risky call. He tied a rope around himself to Mark the path and went in search of an opening. His plan was to fire a flare so everyone could follow the trail to safety. And so began a race against time. The IF charged through the blaze, marking the way. As he ran, the fire roared, smoke choked the air. One wrong step and he'd be crushed by burning trees. But somehow he pushed on. Bruised but alive, he kept searching. And then he ran into an even bigger wall of fire. Still, he didn't stop. He pulled his hood tight, gripped his axe, and hacked his way through the flames. Last he saw the river ahead. But the smoke was so thick he could barely open his eyes. He couldn't waste a second. He fired the flare. But to his horror, it was a dud. The hope that had just sparked instantly died. Exhausted and broken, the chief collapsed to the ground.

He was a magician. The method he used to steal a five hundred million dollar diamond was so risky hardly anyone would dare attempt it. He painted his entire body white and stood inside the museum like a statue. He looked exactly like an ordinary exhibit. Not a single guard suspected that the person standing there was actually a criminal. But the real game had just begun. In his hand he held a book. Inside it was hidden a tiny control panel. With it, he was controlling a small black car. The car emerged from behind a column and started moving along a black line drawn on the floor. Every detail had been planned down to the millimeter. The car blended into the pattern so seamlessly that no camera could detect any movement. For a moment, it seemed like the plan might fail. A guard walked right into the car's path and stopped. He said something on the radio and stood there. But the thief didn't panic. The car slowly slid under the guard's feet without making a single sound. When the car reached the glass case where the diamond was kept, the real show began. The car jumped up, wedged itself between the glass and the pedestal and started climbing the vertical surface. As soon as it reached the right spot, the car our transformed. Out came a tiny robotic arm which carefully removed the diamond and immediately projected a 3D hologram in Its place, the hologram was so perfect that even a close inspection couldn't reveal the difference between the real and the fake. The diamond was now in the hands of that genius. He calmly walked away without being noticed. The guard was still patrolling near the statue, completely unaware. But just as the thief was leaving, something happened that no one had anticipated. His shoulder accidentally brushed against a police officer. The officer turned, looked at him closely, and in that moment a flicker of suspicion appeared in his eyes. He had figured it all out.

Underneath the grave marker was a small, hidden lock. She remembered her father had once given her a mysterious key. She used the key in the lock, and as it clicked open, the lower part of the grave slowly slid aside, revealing a door that opened by itself. Torn between fear and curiosity, the girl stepped inside. When she turned on a light, she gasped. And surprise! It was a huge secret room filled with old, valuable things her father had collected. A camera on a table caught her eye. When she played it, she saw a video message from her father. He revealed he hadn't died. He had faked his death to hide from the world while he searched for the secret of immortality on a mysterious island. Determined to find him, the girl quickly rented a boat and sailed towards the island. But just as she neared it, a terrible storm hit. Waves crashed against the boat. Forced to act, she jumped into the sea. Luckily, she washed ashore on the very same island. Looking up, she spotted someone on a cliff. As she got close, closer, she saw it was her father. But strangely, he tried to hide even after seeing her. The girl followed him, climbing up to a dark cave where he was living. She called out, but he wouldn't respond. Finally, she made a special hand and signal only the two of them knew. Then, He believed it was truly his daughter. He explained why he'd been hiding for so many years. An ancient queen was buried on the island. Believed to be a cursed goddess, legend said anyone who touched her body would slowly become immortal. She was hidden away to protect the world.

That's the chart lying. Which doesn't make sense. You know Liz mistress? Yeah. She worked for Megan. That was her boyfriend. He ran outside. This is your chart? She's on the MAO inhibitors for depression. She's on the pill. She had an abortion a month ago, and she's allergic to cephalosporin. What's going on? Everybody's saying this is a Megan. Yes, Ben. Since when? Since right before I began pretending I loved it. Jeez. Same size as Megan. Same Bill, same hair color. They were both horribly injured. Unrecognizable.

I had no idea why she did it. Through the keyhole, I saw her place my hair on her own head. In an instant, she became me. And I, in turn became her. The old woman entered my house and seduced my husband. I didn't dare get close. Hiding behind a tree, I shouted to my husband, that woman is a fake! He rushed forward, but frozen terror when he saw me. Even our daughter screamed in fright. I stared at the old woman and stormed inside. She seemed very familiar with the house. When she wasn't looking, I slipped in and saw a business card in her bag. The name was completely unknown to me. At that moment, a strange red light burst from the bag. It was a magic book. I was under a spell. The way to break it was to let my hair grow back to its original length. Then I could regain my face. Learning the method, I felt a huge relief. The weight on my shoulders vanished. I measured my hair every day for half a year. Every single day. Now it was only 1 cm short. I would finally look like myself again. However, two months passed and my hair hadn't grown a bit. I couldn't figure out what went wrong. Finally, I decided to stop waiting. Under the cover of night, I returned to my old home. It seem my husband and daughter had struggled Over the past six months. At dawn, I woke to find my face had miraculously returned to normal. Perhaps my daughter's touch had made this miracle happen. At last I could see them in the daylight. I longed to go home, but the house was completely empty. Fear surged through me. Had they been in danger?

Just when he was about to give up, an elegant woman appeared, handed him a handkerchief. As he reached for it, a spark lit between them. The woman blushed instantly. When he wiped his face and looked up, she was shocked. His head was covered in fresh strawberries. He picked one and gave it to her. But suddenly his girlfriend rushed over, dragging him away from the woman. She pulled him into a corner, stood on tiptoe and devoured every strawberry from his head, not leaving a single one. He leaned in for a kiss. She turned away coldly. Her interest was only in the fruit. So he came up with an idea. He forced his power and grew rotten strawberries instead. He gave her one. As soon as she bit into it, her body broke out in ugly bumps. She screamed and ran off. He stood there crushed and alone. But then the elegant woman returned. She held his hand softly and pulled him into a warm hug. In that moment, new strawberries bloomed on his head. Love had brought them back to life. He gently picked one, fed it to her, and she sweetly gave one back to him. In the end, they lived happily ever after.

The cat curled up in the popcorn bowl. She sat next to him, but noticed another huge hole in her stockings, which made her burst into tears. He didn't notice, so she hugged him to distract, grabbed a stocking, added it and handed it. With a smile, she hurried back to the bathroom.

She already had a headache, tried to fix the mess, picked up clips and started mending the holes one by one. Barely able to breathe, her stockings eventually came undone. To her surprise, someone knocked again. No choice, she grabbed tape and wrapped her legs, hiding all the fat. Though the surface looks smooth, the pain, however, was very real.

As she walked down the path, she looked around, stunned by this strange new place. Suddenly, a motorcycle roared past her. Elsa got so scared she shook all over. Thankfully, she forced herself to stay calm, which stopped her ice magic from erupting. But wherever she went, she left behind a long trail of ice. This quickly caught the police's attention. Two officers followed the icy trail to a warehouse. Hearing someone enter, Elsa quickly hid in a corner. Her panic caused her magic to spiral out of control, accidentally summoning a snow monster. Two officers froze in shock. Right then, the snow monster attacked them. A drop gun went off by accident, enraging the creature even more. It leapt over the fence and ran into the street. Hearing the bystanders, their screams seemed to excite the monster. It turned and ran out of town, vanishing deep into the forest. Meanwhile, Elsa had nowhere to go and wandered into an antique shop. There, she spotted her sister's necklace. To find her sister, she used her magic to seal the entire town. Officer Emma arrived at the scene and by chance saw Elsa surrounded by snowflakes. After Emma comforted her, she realized Elsa was searching for her sister. Just then, two of Emma's colleagues appeared. Elsa's emotions spiraled again, and suddenly a wall of ice shot up from the ground, blocking them out. Elsa declared she would only release Emma if They helped her find her sister. Seeing this, the two ran back to town to search. Just as Emma was about to faint from the cold, her colleagues returned saying they had found a way to locate her sister. This news cheered Elsie up. She immediately melted a large hole in the ice wall. But as she left, she forgot her necklace on the icy layer.

Immediately, my parents, as if controlled by puppets, grabbed the forks from the dining table and started stabbing themselves in the face. I tried desperately to stop them, but it was completely useless. Only when my aunt threw the branch into a bowl of water did my parents finally stop. My aunt forced me to keep a secret. She said that if I didn't obey, she would make my parents hurt themselves to death. Faced with her threats and my own fear, I had no choice. In the following days, I went to school as usual, but my parents just sat at the dining table motionless, worried about their health. I went into my aunt's room to ask. She only told me to buy canned food to feed them. From then on, every day after school, I would first go to the supermarket to buy cans, then rush home, carefully feeding my parents. This life continued for a long time. One night, my aunt suddenly woke me up in the dim room. Her face was pale as paper. Weekly she told me she was gravely ill, that the hospital could no longer save her, and she hoped I could save her. Then she made a condition. Once she recovered, I had to bring her something from each of my classmates. To save my parents as quickly as possible, I sneaked back into the classroom while my classmates were playing Basketball and took their name tags. At that moment, the homeroom teacher Alex walked in, noticed something was wrong, and tried to comfort me. But my mind was only on saving my parents. After school, I put the classmates name tags into my aunt's room. That night, my aunt began the ritual, gently shaking the bell in her hand as the clock struck 2:17. One by one, all the classmates ran out of their homes, down to the streets, and finally into the basement of my house. It was then I realised my aunt had deceived me. But seeing my parents still under control, I didn't dare expose her and had to stay silent, even cooperating when the police questioned us. When the police came to search the house, I helped my aunt tidy things up, watching as she used magic to hide the classmates outside. Once the police left, the classmates were brought back to the basement. After school resumed, I was moved to another class. But every day after school I still went to the supermarket for canned food. Only now at home, I had to feed not only my two unresponsive parents, but also the classmates trapped in the basement.

Everything went black. Morning cold water splashed my face. They dragged me out for a walk just like a real dog. The chain was gone, but the collar still clamped tight. I saw no one behind me and bolted. Only a few steps. The colour lit up. It tightened around my throat. A warning blared from hidden speakers piercing my ears. The wire fence was right ahead. I grabbed it. A jolt of electricity tore through me, blackness again. When I woke up, I Was back in the kennel. This time another man was inside. I rushed to him, thrilled, asking what was going on. He said he'd been kidnapped, too. We stayed locked up together. Only one thought in my mind, escape. Next day, we were let out, nobody behind us. We pretended to stroll, crept closer to the fence.

He treated himself like a relay baton, passing himself between horses. As soon as the little horse got the postman, it switch to high gear. Speed instantly shot up to 370 and even steep, dangerous cliffs felt like flat ground. As the ace of the postal world, the man's goal was always to deliver the letter as fast as possible. But there was one thing that limited his speed, the stamina of the horse under him. So whenever the horse started slowing down, he would contact the post office ahead of him to prepare a new horse. When they heard the ace postman was on his way, a rookie horse immediately volunteered. Though inexperienced, he had a passion for the Postal Service. Seeing the little horse so eager, the boss couldn't wait to approve him. After a few friendly words of advice, the little horse, full of energy, went to the roadside, warming up and getting into the zone. Now starting the ninth set of calisthenics. March in place. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Stop! At that moment, the postman's old horse, eager to clock out, saw the little horse and quickly handed the man over like a baton. The little horse grabbed him and pressed him against his back, activating turbo mode and shooting off. Experienced old horses watching this couldn't Help but smirk. The little horse, fresh to the job, was fearless and reckless, speeding insanely fast. But he was distracted, not watching the road, and both he and the postman plunged off a cliff. Luckily, a pond below softened their fall. More fortunately, they had two and a half years of breath holding training. But the bad luck didn't stop there. Just as they resurfaced, they fell into an even deeper pool. As bubbles floated to the surface, the postman's greeting to the little horse was definitely full of gold. The little horse, thoroughly dejected, lay motionless. The engine waterlogged, but the postman had a few slick tricks up his sleeve. Fully revived, the little horse was back on his hooves, running like a beast. Until a sudden emergency break flung the postman off the cliff. He slid for five or six hundred meters before realizing something was wrong. But he stayed calm, performed an emergency stop, and spun around, riding the air back toward the little horse. One had to wonder if he and Newton shared some sort of mysterious connection. But just when things seemed to settle, the postman found himself in trouble again. The infamous bandit Jiang Yang was now on his tail. Rumor had it this Bandit could make even the mighty Nezza leave behind three pounds of lotus powder. Before robbing anyone, he had to apply sunscreen. He was a beauty fanatic, after all. Despite his small stature of only half a meter, his Horse under him was no slouch. The height of two and a half meters, he looked down on every preschooler. The postman sensed danger and quickly turned. He saw the bandit closing in fast, so he slammed the brakes, using the little horse's cover to prepare for a one on one showdown. But the little horse, realising something was off, bolted behind the postman. No matter what the man commanded, he just wouldn't listen. After all, he was just a horse. The man gave up trying to order him around and decided to use reason. Fists are the real answer. A saying that proved true. But before he could fight back, he locked eyes with the bandit, awkwardly smiling and politely nodding. Then he turned and ran. The little horse, now fully awake, followed closely. To their surprise, they reached a perfect synchronization, racing together powerfully, shaking off the bandit and charging into the final station. The Bandit, now headed straight for the iron gate, slammed on the brakes in panic, throwing out a two room apartment in the process. Finally, the postman delivered the letter. But just as he did, he was stunned to see a little elf pop out of the bag.

To her surprise, she heard another knock at the door. With no choice, she grabbed tape and wrapped it around her legs, hiding all the fat. Though the surface looks smooth, the pain was real.

She opened the door confidently, but didn't expect her Boyfriend to praise the cat instead.

Then by accident, she grabbed a little rabbit. She thought, well, why not a snack? The rabbit panicked. Don't eat me. I promise. I can make you happy. The lioness found it funny and decided to give him a chance. The rabbit was confident, thinking he was super charming, but he was tiny. The lioness barely felt anything. He tried all sorts of special moves, but she was getting impatient. Just then, a cheetah walked by. The lioness panicked. She didn't want anyone to see what was happening. She pressed the rabbit under her body. The rabbit struggled, still trying hard. The lioness's face showed a mysterious smile. The cheetah was completely confused. Before the cheetah could figure it out, a hunter appeared. The cheetah ran away and the lioness carried the rabbit to safety. At last, she let him go. The rabbit collapsed, soaking wet. Then the male lion showed up again. The lioness lifted the rabbit and said, this little guy is fun. I'll keep him around. The rabbit froze thinking. That's one crazy story to remember. Under the warm sun of the grassland, the wind blowing gently, the rabbit couldn't believe what just happened. And so the absurd but hilarious story of the lions and the little Rabbit continued to spread across the grassland.

The woman from the TV actually climbed out. Lisa was so scared that she stuffed popcorn into her mouth like crazy. After climbing out, the woman first poured out the water from her head. Lisa angrily accused her of dirtying the floor. The woman got angry, too. And approached Lisa. Step by step, Lisa shouted for Anna to help her. Anna thought she was playing another prank. Lisa had to handle it by herself. Get up, you little ugly bitch. Come on. Let me see what you got. What you got? That's all. Oh, oh. I wasn't asking you. Yeah, what's up? Oh! Oh!

He casually grabs a bundle of hay, rolls it into a cigarette just to light it up. Then he rips off someone's roof and uses the fireplace as a lighter. But that's not all. After lighting the cigarette, he leans back on someone's grain storage, slowly enjoying his smoke. This caused a massive panic among the villagers. To calm everyone down, the king immediately puts out an announcement calling for warriors to take down the giant. Days go by and no one shows up. Just when the king was stuck, a little wealthy kid swats a fly and kills seven in one go. Proud of himself, he starts bragging. Word spreads fast and soon the king hears about it. He immediately orders the boy to come to him. The king asks if it's true that he killed seven flies with one hit. The boy proudly says yes, and he puts on an over the top performance to prove his point. Seeing how dramatic he was, the king believed him instantly, so the boy was tasked with taking down the giant. Hearing this, the boy is stunned. He starts to explain, but the king suddenly adds if. If you succeed, I'll give you my daughter's hand in marriage. Before he can react, the princess runs over and kisses him repeatedly. Dazed from the kiss, the boy agrees to the task and steps out of the gates to the cheers of the crowd. Once the gates Close, he starts to panic. He desperately tries to get back in. Looking at the crowd and the princess, he can't refuse anymore. Nervously, he heads off. But he's just a tailor. What does he know about fighting giants? Just then, the ground shakes and a massive figure looms over him. Realising the danger, he looks up, but almost gets stomped by the giant's massive foot. Panicked, he runs as fast as he can. He reaches a house, hoping to slow the giant down. But the giant steps over the small obstacle like it's nothing. With nowhere to hide, the boy jumps into a pumpkin. The giant, seeing this, grabs the pumpkin without hesitation. The boy is trapped inside, and both he and the pumpkin are swallowed whole. Fortunately, as the pumpkin rolls around, he grabs onto the giant's hanging beard. This makes the giant think he's joking. The giant gulps down water, sending the boy down into his stomach. But the boy manages to escape, and once again the giant spots him. Nowhere left to hide, the boy takes out his Scissors to fight back. Angry, the giant slaps him, but the boy hides in the giant's sleeve. The giant, enraged, reaches into his sleeve. But this is exactly what the boy wanted. As the giant pulls his hand out, the boy sews it shut with a needle and thread. With the job done, he heads straight for the giant's head, throwing a rope to his nose. The giant In pain, can't fight back as the boy wraps him up from head to toe. Finally, with a sharp tug, the boy flips the giant over, securing his defeat. The giant, now controlled, becomes the power source for the amusement park, blowing air to keep it running.

Without any warning, she suddenly yanked out all of my teeth. I completely broke down and screamed at the top of my lungs. That lunatic picked up my teeth one by one, calmly press them into her own gums, then placed them inside her own mouth. When I saw her walking toward me, I felt my soul about to flee my body. She tore off her rubber gloves and covered my mouth. And in that moment I realised she looked exactly like me. She ripped the engagement ring from my hand, and in an instant I understood everything. She wanted to become me, to steal my life and my fiance. I could never let that happen. Like a pea shooter, I fired at the switch again and again. The handcuffs on my wrists sprang open, but my feet were still trapped. I turned to the side, grabbed a chainsaw, shielded the sparks with its blade, and cut through the chains on my ankles with all my strength. Once free, I rushed to a mirror. My teeth were a disaster, like those of an 80 year old woman. There was no way I could get married like this. So I decided to make myself a new set of teeth. I dug through trash and found plenty of wisdom teeth and cavities, thankfully enough in number. I sculpted and colour them bit by bit in my gums. Then Polish them until they were tolerable to look at. They tasted disgusting. I wiped them clean, refine them one by one until the shape was perfect. Finally, I brush them inside and out, and the result was almost identical to my former expensive teeth. Exhausted as I was, my new teeth gleamed brilliantly. I picked up pliers and pried the door open in three seconds. By the time I finished everything, the wedding was already over. Dusk was falling, reminding me to hurry. I climbed a wall covered in vines, inhaling mouthfuls of dust, and just as I was about to smash the window, I saw my fiance freeze mid action.

I was on Facetime at 1:00am with my girlfriend when my mom burst through my door without knocking, finding me mid laugh with Nadine on my phone screen. Are you serious right now? Mom shrieked, grabbing my phone while Nadine's confused face disappeared into darkness. This is completely inappropriate. It's a school night. Dad appeared behind her, shaking his head like I committed some federal crime. They didn't care that I had straight A's, that this was my chance with my crush, or that these late night calls were the only thing keeping her interested in me. You're 16. You don't need to be talking to girls at all hours. It was insane. Complete device lockdown after 9 p m. Phone physically placed in their bedroom every night. Wi-Fi router programmed to kill my connection. Even my laptop taken away just in case. Mom installed one of those parental control apps that sent her alerts if I even touched any device after curfew. Healthy boundaries, she kept saying, showing me some article about teenage sleep schedule she'd found on Facebook. That first night without talking to Nadine was torture. I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, wondering if she thought I was ignoring her, if she was upset, if she think I didn't care anymore. My parents did three separate checks that night, opening my door to make sure I was in bed, sleep device less, and alone. The second night, I Couldn't handle it. Nadine had texted me 17 times during school asking if I was okay if we were breaking up. Then I got an idea. I remembered my iPhone 6 buried in my closet. Cracked screen, terrible battery. But it could work. After my parents 9:30 p m. Check, I waited until 10:15 to be safe, then pulled out the hidden phone. Nadine's face appeared, pixelated and laggy, but she was smiling. I thought your parents murdered you, she whispered, and I had to bite my tongue to keep from laughing. We developed an intricate system based on my parents patterns. Mom always did checks throughout the night. I became a master of deception. The moment I heard her footsteps on the stairs. I'd whisper, she's coming to Nadine, kill the screen, slide the phone under my pillow, close my eyes, and control every micro expression on my face. The hardest part was when mom would just stand there staring, and I'd have to remain completely stone faced, breathing steady and deep, like I was truly asleep. Once mom actually walked over and stood directly over me for a full minute. It was torture. Then, weirdly, Nadine asked me, babe, are you okay? You keep coughing. I hadn't even noticed I was doing it, but she was right. My throat felt scratchy and weird. Maybe you're getting sick, she suggested. But. And I smelled it. Something sharp and chemical cutting through my room. Hold on, I whispered. And when I opened my bedroom door. My stomach dropped. Gray smoke was flowing along the hallway ceiling like a river, getting thicker by the second, pouring from the direct

Wait until they see what a year in China taught me. I start seventh grade with a renewed boost of confidence after spending a year with my grandparents in China. Walking into the school, I spot my worst nightmare. I knew this moment would come eventually. There's Shane, still the same 5 feet 8 inches tower of teenage cruelty, flanked by his usual suspects, Minion 1 and Minion 2. Such loyal followers. I'm still only 5 feet 2 inches and probably look exactly the same to them. Same. See? Brown hair, same hand me down clothes, same kid they used to stuff into lockers every Tuesday. Like clockwork. Well, well, well, look who's back, Shane announces loud enough for half the hallway to hear. We missed our little toilet bowl cleaner. Minion one actually claps his hands together like he's genuinely excited. Dude, remember when we made him eat that sandwich off the bathroom floor? They're laughing about it like it's their fondest memory. And I feel that familiar burning in my chest. Except this time it feels different. Controlled. My grandfather's voice echoes in my head. Anger is fire. You can let it burn you, or you can forge steel with it. Minion two steps closer, invading my personal space. Hope you didn't get too comfortable wherever you went, because nothing's changed here. He shoves my shoulder, testing to see if I'll react the same way I used to. Cowering and apologizing instead, I steady myself and look him directly in the eye. Everything's changed, I say quietly, but Minion 2 just laughs and walks away with his friends. Same scared little mouse. Shane calls over his shoulder. See you in P E. Bathroom, boy. P E. Class arrives like a death sentence, and of course coach pairs us up for defensive exercises, which basically his excuse to let kids beat each other up legally. Shane immediately volunteers to be my partner, grinning like Christmas morning. This is going to be fun! He tells Minion 1 and Minion 2, who are partnered nearby. I've been saving up a year's worth of frustration. He starts small, an accidental elbow to my ribs during warm UPS. Oops! Sorry Mouse Boy, didn't mean to hurt you. When I tell him I'm not weak anymore, he literally doubles over laughing. Not weak? You're the same 70 pound scarecrow who cried when I gave you a wedgie! That's when he crosses the line. During partner exercises, he's supposed to hold the punching pad steady, but instead he keeps jerking it away so my punches miss and I stumble forward. Maybe if you ate some actual food instead of whatever they feed mice. The rage is building in my chest, but I hear Grandpa's training. The river that moves mountains doesn't rage. It flows with purpose. Coach steps away to help another student with their form, and that's when Shane decides to get Creative. Minion 1 comes and hands Shane a bucket, which he dumps over my head. Water splashes down, soaking my clothes. Here you go, mouse boy, you looked a bit thirsty. Minion 1 and Minion 2 are recording with their phones now, probably planning to post it on social media. I'm dripping wet and Shane gets in my face, but still I hold back. Then he spots my friend Jace across the gym and smiles. Shane's now

We can't make it Mike's last game. They'd missed every recital for his practices, every graduation for his tournaments. Why would my wedding be different? That's fine, I said. The wedding was perfect. 60 people who wanted to be there. My grandfather walked me down the aisle. The photographer didn't have to edit anyone out. My Aunt Patricia posted photos on Facebook. Beautiful wedding. Though some people think football is more important than family, it went viral in 12 hours. Mom has 6,000 Facebook friends. Every single one saw her tagged in wedding photos she wasn't in. Messages started while we were in Greece. Mike, you manipulative bitch. Mom's crying. Mom, how dare You not tell me then your father is leaving me. Then please answer. Father sent one message, I failed you. I'm at a hotel. Your mother needs to decide if she wants both children or just one. Grandpa sent a photo of himself at my parents house standing over my crying father. Caption fixed one of them. We returned to 47 voicemails. Mom sobbing, Mike cursing, aunts either supporting me or.

While doing my nightly patrol, I noticed a black Hundai swerving in the highway doing 95 miles per hour. When I finally got the driver to pull over and step out of the vehicle, my jaw dropped. It was my wife, drunker than an Irishman, staring right at me. But instead of looking guilty or ashamed, she lunged at me. You cheater, she yelled, clawing her nails at my face. I tried to restrain her, but she just kept hitting me and trying to gauge my eyes until I had no choice but to handcuff her by force. I placed her into the backseat and took off for the police station. The whole ride the cray, she kept saying our marriage was over and refused to elaborate why she thought I cheated. My heart genuinely broke bringing her in. I thought she was having another psychotic break. Then she saw a picture of my coworker Dana's face on the wall and started yelling, that's her. That's the one you're sleeping with. I was genuinely confused. Me and Dana sometimes patrol together, but that was it. I stayed in that station talking to my wife for hours, trying to plead that I never cheated, but she wouldn't listen to a word I said. I was eventually forced to just leave her in the cell and head home. When I came back in the morning, my wife was still there. And that's when I saw Dana in the break room. She rushed to me immediately. Oh, my god. Are you okay? Your wife is so crazy for saying all of that about us. Is there anything I can do to help? I told her, yes, there was. I took her to my wife and asked Dana to explain that we never slept together. You're both lying. I found your lipstick. In his patrol car, my wife slurred. Dana, who was stepping back, looking genuinely scared. And before anyone else could get a word in, my wife's parents arrived at the station. Father jabbed his finger into my chest. You piece of garbage. How dare you arrest your own wife? Her mother was right behind him, tears streaming down her face. How dare you sleep with your coworker? The whole station was now watching. The chief even stepped out and I had to convince him I was handling this. That's when Dana stepped forward. She was usually a hothead in confrontation, but her hands were up peacefully. For some reason, sir and ma'am, there's been a huge misunderstanding. Your son in law and I are just colleagues. My father in law whipped around to face her. We know all about you. Late night shifts, text messages. Jennifer showed us everything. I grabbed my mother in law's arm. What text messages? I've never texted Dana outside of work schedules. My wife suddenly gripped the bars. January 15th, February 3rd, March 22nd, all dates you were texting. Should I Keep going. I pulled out my phone, scrolling frantically through my messages, but I found nothing. I don't know what you're talking about. Tina touched my shoulder gently. This is so confusing for you. Maybe someone spoofed your number. My father in law got in my face. Get her out of that cell now. We're taking her home. I told him politely that doing this in the police station wasn't the brightest move. His face went red. That's when the desk sergeant intervened. Sir, she blew a point one nine. Your daughter is facing DUI charges. Bail hearing isn't until noon. Then we'll wait. Her mother spat. And our lawyer will be hearing about this false imprisonment. Dana pulled me aside while they went to sit with my wife. Listen, I think you should go home, check on your son. This is getting really ugly and you look exhausted. She was right.

Everyone knew Blake and Rosalie were going to last forever. Like, seriously, this guy had her military dad laughing so hard he choked. The first time they ever met, while the rest of us had never even heard him speak, Blake invented Random Flower Day, where once a month he'd show up with a bouquet of exotic flowers shipped from a different country around the world. Each time our girlfriends would literally use him as an example during every argument. This is what a real man looks like. He organized flash mobs for her birthday, Learned to cook her grandmother's recipes and treated Rosalie like it was her birthday every day. Then Rosalie's mom got diagnosed with Lupus and Blake didn't even hesitate. He switched to night shifts at his accounting firm so he could drive her mom to treatments during the day. He even sold his beloved motorcycle, the one he'd rebuilt with his dad, just to over the copays when Rosalie's family hit their insurance limit. While the rest of us were complaining about meeting our girlfriend's parents once a month, Blake was at every single family dinner, helping Rosalie's mother cook, helping her dad fix the roof, and teaching her little brother to drive. Three years in, Blake proposed. He got down on one knee at her favorite restaurant with her whole family there with her grandmother's ring he'd personally restored and gave This speech about how she saved him from being a workaholic with no purpose. Whole restaurant started clapping. Rosalie was crying so hard she could barely say yes. The wedding planning was insane. Blake handled everything. She got stressed about vendor calls, seating arrangements, dealing with her crazy aunt who demanded vegan options for everyone. The day finally came. It was a beautiful beach and packed with 300 guests. Rosalie looked incredible walking down that aisle. Her dad tearing up next to her and Blake standing at the altar with tears already running down his face. The efficient Blake's best friend went through all the traditional stuff, the readings, the vows. Rosalie went first and by the end, everyone was dabbing their eyes with tears. Then came the big moment. Do you, Blake, take Rosalie to be your lawfully wedded wife? The whole beach was silent. Everyone waiting for that enthusiastic yes we all expected. Blake looked at Rosalie for what felt like forever. Then he took a deep breath and said, clear as day. Two hours ago, I would have hoisted you up in the air and screamed yes, but now you disgust me and I never want to see you again in my life. He turned and walked away. Rosalie's face went from confused to horrified in about two seconds. Literally collapsed right there in her wedding dress. The best friend stood there with his mouth open. Blake's mom started running after him, screaming his name. Rosalie's bridesmaids. Rushed to her, trying to get her to breathe. The whole beach erupted. People were standing up shouting, asking what the hell just happened. Blake just kept walking, got to the car park where a cab was waiting for him and drove off. Nobody could make sense of it. His groomsmen were blowing up his phone, getting nothing. Rosalie had to be sedated.

Monica and I were getting married in 10 weeks. I was signing our wedding venue contract when she stopped me. We should date other people before we get married. The pen fell out of my hand. I laughed because I thought she was joking. I'm serious. It will make us stronger. She showed me an article on her phone about open relationships. She had saved it two months ago. Two months? She'd been planning this while I was planning our honeymoon. Her phone kept buzzing with texts. She grabbed it and smiled at whatever she was reading. She said we needed to explore ourselves before getting married. She said we'd be more confident in our choice. She even mentioned that her best friend Jenna, never took risks and had a boring life. The whole time she was talking, her phone kept lighting up with messages. Kept checking them while talking to me. Something was wrong here. Fine. If you think dating others will help us, let's do it. Her face lit up completely. She looked like she'd won something big. She immediately started texting someone back really fast. I could hear her nails clicking on the phone screen. She thought I would just wait at home while she dated other people. She had no idea what was about to happen. What? The first date night came. Monica spent three hours getting ready. She wore a brand new black dress she'd bought Just for tonight. Her coworker Kyle picked her up, and she practically ran to his car. Then Jenna called and asked if I wanted to get dinner. Monica said you guys are opening things up. She said quietly, yeah, she's with Kyle right now. Jenna went silent for a long time. I knew something was happening with them. At dinner, Jenna barely touched her food. Monica's been lying to me, too, she said. Remember her work conference last month? She never went. Her hands were shaking. How do you know? I saw her location on Find My Friends. She was at Kyle's apartment the whole weekend. When I asked her about the conference, she gave me all these fake details about sessions she attended. I reached over and touched her hand. She didn't pull away. We should keep this between us, I said. Don't tell anyone about the open relationship. Let Monica think everything's working perfectly. Jenna nodded. We need to document everything she's done. Get evidence. We were both angry and hurt. This was about justice. That night, I heard everything through our bedroom wall. Monica had brought Kyle back to our apartment. Every sound, every word, everything. She was completely oblivious that I could hear them. I texted Jenna, can I come over? Twenty minutes later, I was on her couch while she made us tea. She doesn't even realize you can hear, Jenna said about the noises. She's too caught up in Kyle to think about anything. Else, we spent hours planning how to expose Monica's lies. When I left at 4 a m, she gave me her spare key. In case you need to escape again. After that first week, Jenna and I met daily to collect evidence. Screenshots of Monica's fake conference receipts, photos from Kyle's social media that proved her lies. She'd bring me lunch when I forgot to eat during our planning sessions. Two sugars. No.

My best friend, Trent, paced around the room nervously. What do I do? I think our roommate is in love with me, he muttered. I bursted into laughter. Gemma? I highly doubt it, I said. Our roommates, Gemma and Ali, definitely hadn't shown they were interested in Trent at all. From what I'd seen, Gemma was naturally friendly and Ali was quiet and closed off. But Trent insisted. He pushed a crumpled piece of paper to my chest, laughing, read it and weep. I scanned through the paper that definitely very clearly stated my dazzling Trent, and I was shocked. He was right. Someone had a huge crush on him. Are you sure it's Gemma? I asked. Trent nodded and explained how there had been obvious signs. He offered me coffee when I came over. He said, that's basically asking me out. I reminded him she offered everyone coffee, but she laughed at all my jokes. Then she asked about my weekend plans. That's basically girl code for checking if I'm single, Or she's just asking about your weekend plans like a normal person, I suggested. Then he pulled out actual evidence, a poem on the kitchen counter with romantic lines like brown eyes sweeter than honey and a laugh that makes Monday mornings bearable. That's totally me, he yelled. I shrugged. I don't see it, I joked. He rolled his eyes. And haven't you noticed every time I visit There's always a gift waiting for me. Yeah, I remember that. A box of his favorite brand of herbal tea that no one else drank showed up on his table the day we were out, along with a bookmark with a quote from a movie he mentioned liking and a stress ball that showed up right before his big job interview. Trent had spent weeks building up the courage to talk to Gemma about it, waiting for that one sure sign that Gemma really felt that way about, about him. Then that sign arrived tonight. Trent had stayed late to help me with a project when we heard singing through the walls. One of the girls had been singing Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me in the most angelic voice. Then we heard it. She actually sang his name, adding Trent right into the lyrics. Trent jumped off the couch like he'd been electrocuted. I told you she likes me, he half whispered. He decided right then he was going to confess his feelings. Thanks, too. The next day he showed up at our apartment with a bouquet of roses and a poem he wrote on his own. Trent nervously walked over to Gemma, who was chilling on the couch watching Netflix. He looked up at the flowers and smiled. Wow, nice flowers. You look great, she said, calm and friendly like always. Trent cleared his throat. I know about the poems and the gifts and the song. Gemma's smile. Turned into confusion. Trent, what is this? What's going on? Gemma stared at Trent for a long moment. Wait, are you talking?

So I started dating a guy older than him. See how he likes it? I'm 22 and my dad is 48. Last year after my parents divorced, he started dating this 20 year old girl named Becca. Yes, she's literally two years younger than me. Disgusting, right? At first I thought it was just some midlife crisis fling. But then he started bringing her to family dinners and introducing her as his girlfriend. She'd sit there giggling at everything he said while I'm sitting across from them wanting to throw up. The worst part was watching my dad act like some teenage boy around her, buying her jewelry and taking her on fancy trips while my mom was still fighting for alimony money. Who would even try to give me advice about college in my dating life. Like, girl, you literally just graduated high school two years ago. She'd be like, oh, honey, you should totally try this new face mask I saw on TikTok while I'm thinking about how she's closer to my age than my dad's. The breaking point came when my dad announced they were moving in together. He called a family meeting with me and my little brother to tell us Becca would be around more often. My 16 year old brother just stared at his phone the whole time while I sat there fuming. That's when I decided to give my dad a taste of His own medicine. I started scrolling through dating apps, specifically looking for older guys. I found this 55 year old guy named Robert who owns a construction company. He's divorced, has kids older than me, but he's actually pretty cool and treats me well. Plus he looks way better than my dad, even though he's older. I started bringing Robert to family events. The look on my dad's face when I introduced my boyfriend at my cousin's birthday party was priceless. Robert showed up in his nice truck wearing a button down shirt, shook my dad's hand firmly and started talking about his business and his two kids who are 24 and 26. My dad kept shooting me these confused looks all night. Becca kept whispering to him, asking if Robert was really my boyfriend. Robert was being super.

My sister Kaylee walked into my room and screamed, I hate you. I was so confused. What happened, I asked, as she threw her backpack at the wall in a rage. My friends saw us walking together this morning and they told everyone, you're babysitting me. She was practically hyperventilating. They made babysitter jokes all day. They said I probably still wet the bed. I laughed at that, which was the wrong move. Kaylee, I'm just making sure you're safe. I don't care. I'm in seventh grade. All my friends walk alone. I don't need you. She put her hands in her face and I could see her shoulders shaking. Everyone thinks I'm a total loser now. Claire doesn't even wanna be seen with me. He looked up at me with this calculating expression, you have to stop. Promise me you'll stop walking with me or I swear I'll tell mom about you sneaking out to see that guy last week. I groaned, knowing I'd be dead if they knew about that. Fine, I said, but we're doing this my way. The next morning, I thought Kaylee would be thrilled that I wasn't walking with her, but when she saw me putting on my shoes at 7:30, she completely freaked out. What are you doing? She demanded, getting ready for school. I said, confused? You said you weren't going to walk with me anymore? Her Voice was getting panicked. I'm not walking with you. I'm walking to school. You can go ahead if you want. Her face went red. That's the same thing. People will still see us. We argued for five minutes before she finally gave up. Fine, but I'm walking way ahead, like way ahead, and you better not follow too close. She stormed out first, practically running. I waited about 30 seconds, then left. We made it one block before she turned around and started yelling, you're too close. Slow down. She just kept going. I can hear your footsteps. Slow down. But when she saw Claire's mom's car driving by, she completely lost it. Get further back. Hide behind something. Do something. She was practically sprinting now, her purple backpack bouncing as she tried to put more distance between us. I said further, she shouted, without even looking back. By the time we hit the main road, she was so far ahead I could barely see her. I watched her turn the corner by the pharmacy, her purple backpack visible for just a second. I looked down to check my phone. One second, maybe two. When I looked back up, she was gone. Just gone. No purple backpack, nothing. Kaylee, I called out but not too loud because honestly, I thought she was messing with me. She probably ducked into a.

Dinner was painfully awkward. It had been two years since mom left and my dad's girlfriend Britt had tried too hard to impress us, making Dinosaur nuggets and smiley face Mac and cheese like we were 5. My brother flipped his plate and glared at her. First you try to take dad away and now you're bribing us with nuggets, he asked coldly. Colton, Dad yelled. Britt smiled. You're right. Next time I'll add spaghetti, she joked. Table fell silent. Dad coughed awkwardly and stood up to take a call. That's when Brit leaned forward and looked at me and my siblings with a serious expression. Look, I know this is weird, she said. What will it take for you guys to actually like me? My older brother leaned forward too, eyeing her down and said in his toughest 13 year old voice, do everything we say for one month. Brit didn't even hesitate. Deal what's first. What she didn't know was that my brother was already prepared to go to war with her. And what we didn't know was that Brit was prepared to. My brother announced the first impossible challenge, best us at every video game we own. I knew he'd start here. Colton was undefeated at Fortnite in our entire school. But Brit showed up the next day having studied YouTube tutorials all night. She destroyed him five rounds straight. Then did the floss dance over His defeated character. My little sister innocently cheered while my brother insisted it didn't count, that he was just warming up. Best of 10, he said, and she won eight out of 10. When my brother looked sad, she showed him the trick she Learned. That way you'll destroy everyone else, he winked. The next challenge was pure physical. Old people can't do obstacle courses, my brother grinned, building one in the backyard with everything from tire runs to rope climbs. But when Brit showed up in full Crossfit gear, we knew we were done for. She ended up beating my brother's record by 30 seconds. Now do it backwards, he demanded. She did it backwards now blindfolded. I saw my brother mouth, what the heck when she actually did it blindfolded using only our shouted directions. Honestly, we were impressed. Is that all you got? She teased. This week you have to pick us up from school instead of dad, but you gotta wear embarrassing costumes. And she did. Turns out Brit was a retired cosplayer. She showed up to school in an Optimus Prime costume, then a fully geared up attack on Titan costume and a bunch more insane outfits. My friends kept saying, your mom's cool, don't you dare smile, my brother hissed at me. I'm not, I protested. I totally was. The endurance challenge was my brother's last stand, an anime Marathon of one piece to see who could stay awake. My sister fell asleep on Brit's shoulder. Around hour six, Colton and I crashed. After 14 hours, Brit paused the show and covered us all with blankets. She carried my sister to bed and took off her shoes. She tucked me in on the couch, whispering.

He pushed a crumpled piece of paper to my chest, laughing, read it and weep. I scanned through the paper that definitely very clearly stated my dazzling Trent, and I was shocked. He was right. Someone had a huge crush on him. Are you sure it's Gemma? I asked. Trent nodded and explained how there had been obvious signs. He offered me coffee when I came over. He said, that's basically asking me out. I reminded him she offered everyone coffee, but she laughed at all my jokes. Then she asked about my weekend plans. That's basically girl code for checking if I'm single, Or she's just asking about your weekend plans like a normal person, I suggested. Then he pulled out actual evidence, a poem on the kitchen counter with romantic lines like brown eyes sweeter than honey and a laugh that makes Monday mornings bearable. That's totally me, he yelled. I shrugged. I don't see it, I joked. He rolled his eyes. And haven't you noticed every time I visit There's always a gift waiting for me. Yeah, I remember that. A box of his favorite brand of herbal tea that no one else drank showed up on his table the day we were out, along with a bookmark with a quote from a movie he mentioned liking and a stress ball that showed up right before his big job interview. Trent had spent weeks building up the courage to talk to Gemma about it, waiting for that one sure sign that Gemma really felt that way about, about him. Then that sign arrived tonight. Trent had stayed late to help me with a project when we heard singing through the walls. One of the girls had been singing Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me in the most angelic voice. Then we heard it. She actually sang his name, adding Trent right into the lyrics. Trent jumped off the couch like he'd been electrocuted. I told you she likes me, he half whispered. He decided right then he was going to confess his feelings. Thanks, too. The next day he showed up at our apartment with a bouquet of roses and a poem he wrote on his own. Trent nervously walked over to Gemma, who was chilling on the couch watching Netflix. He looked up at the flowers and smiled. Wow, nice flowers. You look great, she said, calm and friendly like always. Trent cleared his throat. I know about the poems and the gifts and the song. Gemma's smile. Turned into confusion. Trent, what is this? What's going on? Gemma stared at Trent for a long moment. Wait, are you talking?

After telling us that she had mandatory district training for three days starting Monday, my English teacher pointed at me and announced, you'll be teaching the Shakespeare unit while I'm gone since you actually understand the material, unlike everyone else who thinks the movie counts as reading. I stared at her in complete disbelief. Shouldn't we have a substitute teacher? Sure, for this? She shuffled papers, avoiding eye contact because she definitely knew this was wrong. Substitutes are incompetent and I don't have time to train someone on my specific curriculum. I pushed back immediately, but I'm not trained either, and I'm literally a student. She was already halfway out the door, clutching her tote bag. Just follow the lesson plan and make them understand Romeo and Juliet, since there's a test when I get back, have a great weekend. Goodbye. She practically ran from the room before I could protest further. And suddenly I understood exactly how badly this would backfire. Monday morning, I walked into class dragging a suitcase full of zombie makeup and fake blood. We're doing Romeo and Juliet Love in the time of zombies where the Montagues are zombie hunters and the Capulet are secretly infected. Jackson volunteered for Romeo and I told him his character collected zombie teeth as trophies. Sophia got Juliet, who was slowly turning but fighting it for love. We rewrote the balcony scene at the quarantine breach. But soft what light or yonder window breaks, it is the east and Juliet hasn't eaten anyone yet. Jackson delivered while Sophia not on her own arm. For practice, the nurse became a scientist and Friar Lawrence ran an underground zombie shelter. By lunch, everyone had memorized more Shakespeare then they had all semester. Tuesday we created hazmat suits from garbage bags for the Montagues and painted decay on the capsules with whiteout and permanent markers. The party scene became Romeo discovering Juliet wasn't quite human when she tried to bite him during their first kiss. She literally tried to eat your face and you're still into her, someone shouted as Mercutio, who believed the government created the virus. Love conquers all, even the undead, Jackson replied, while Sophia perfected her zombie twitch by watching possum videos. The janitor walked in and saw 30 students covered in fake blood, staging what looked like a biohazard event and immediately left, muttering about his paycheck. Wednesday got completely out of control when I invited other classes to watch without permission. The fight scene turned into Mercurio getting infected while Romeo had to decide whether to kill his best friend before he turned. We used pool noodles as weapons and ketchup packets for blood, which exploded everywhere, coating walls and ceiling and red slatter. A plague on both your houses became. I'm literally plagued by both your houses and it's highly contagious. While the infected Mercurio chased students down the hallway, moaning about Government conspiracies and demanding brains. The cafeteria staff locked their doors when they saw him coming and someone pulled the fire alarm thinking there was an actual emergency happening. The principal arrived after getting six emergency calls about a possible biohazard in the English wing. Plus reports that student.

So I introduced him to my actual boyfriend. For 8 months, sane, acted like my boyfriend in every way possible. We hung out four times a week. He'd sleep over constantly, even had his own drawer at my place. He'd get visibly jealous whenever other guys talk to me at parties, always finding excuse, this is to interrupt conversations or pull me away. He bought me flowers just because, remembered my coffee order perfectly. And we'd spend entire weekends together binge watching shows and cooking dinner like a real couple. My friends all assumed we were dating. My family invited him to barbecue. Even his mom would ask about his girlfriend when she called. But whenever anyone directly asked if we were together, Zane would laugh it off awkwardly. Oh, no, we're just really close friends. I'm not ready for anything serious right now. It stung every single time, but I kept hoping he'd come around. I thought maybe he just needed more time to feel comfortable with labels. Last Friday night changed everything. We were at Kelsey's birthday party and this girl, Alexis from his work showed up. She was clear flirting with him all night, touching his arm, laughing way too loud at his jokes. Finally, she looked me up and down and asked directly, so are you his girlfriend or what? Without hesitation, Zane immediately said, oh, no, we're definitely not together. I'm completely single. Actually, he even stepped lightly. Away from me. When he said it, the humiliation hit me like a truck. Everyone with an earshot was staring. Kelsey looked mortified. For me, I felt my cheeks burning with embarrassment. But instead of running away, crying like I want.

I'd always been the smartest kid in my class, but my family was broke, like really broke. My parents worked cleaning jobs at the airport and always told me, we'll get you there somehow whenever I talked about college. But I knew the numbers didn't add up. My, my mom made $8 an hour and my dad made nine. There was no way. My junior year, my counselor, Missus Douglas, pulled me aside. She had this serious look on her face that made my stomach drop. Lena, you made it to the finals for the state academic scholarship. She said. There are only three students left. I couldn't breathe. This was it. Full ride to any college in the state. I went home and told my parents and my mom actually cried. She hugged me so tight I thought my ribs would crack. We knew you could do it, baby, she whispered. I spent three weeks working on that final essay. Stayed up three nights straight, revised it 10 times, had my English teacher look at it twice. I wrote about growing up, watching my parents come home exhausted every single day, about studying by flashlight when the power got cut off, about wanting to be the first person in my family to graduate college. Two weeks after I submitted it, Mrs. Douglas called me into her office again. This time she looked sad. Lena, I'm sorry. The Committee chose someone else. I didn't cry. I just nodded and said okay. But inside, I felt like someone had punched me in the chest. I walked out of her office, sat behind the school cafeteria by myself and stared at the parking lot. All those cars belong to kids whose parents could just write checks for college. That night, I told my parents. My mom hugged me again and said, there will be other chances, sweetheart. But I could see it in her eyes. She knew this was probably my only real shot. The thing is, missus Douglas had lied to me because I had won. I'd actually won the whole thing. But she knew something I didn't know about the run.

Three days after Grandpa died, my parents arrived at my door with flowers and a business proposal. They wanted guardianship of my unborn baby. Turns out Grandpa had left behind a trust fund that paid $100,000 a year to whoever raised his great grandchildren. My parents were claiming if I gave guardianship to them, we could all have access to it. It's a win win. They smiled sweetly. They left after I told them I needed time to think. They waited exactly three days before going nuclear. I was making breakfast when mom called, crying. The cancer is back at stage 4. Treatment is $80,000 a year, and insurance won't cover it. Two hours later, Annika showed up at my house. She snuck in using the spare key and put her hands on my belly. Before I could react, I had to go through seven years of pain. She whispered, her fingers spreading across my skin like she was claiming territory. Seven years of needles and failure and empty cribs. She swore that with a trust fund, she would give my baby everything I was stressed about private schools, college funds, a big backyard to play in. The baby kicked, and I wondered if I was being selfish by keep. When you've been trained since birth to put family first, setting boundaries feels like a trail. The breaking point came when mom sent a photo of herself in A hospital bed with an I V. In her arm. Starting chemo tomorrow. The caption read. I wish I could afford the treatment that actually works. I arrived to Grandad's funeral three weeks later with guardian ship papers tucked in my purse. But as the last hymn ended and the funeral director cleared his throat, everything changed. He announced that our grandfather had left specific instructions for this moment. Suddenly, the screen behind the casket came to life, and there was a recording of Grandpa propped up in his hospital bed and staring directly at the camera. If my daughter Evelyn is perking up right now thinking this is about trust distributions, he said, and Mom's eager face shifted to confusion, then everything is going according to plan. What none of you know, Grandpa continued, is that I've been recording every conversation in my hospital room for the last six months because I needed evidence. Mom started to stand. This is ridiculous. Evelyn, sit down. Yes, you. I know. You're standing right now about to claim I was senile. She froze midstand and slowly sank back down. You told my granddaughter your cancer returned. Stay for right. Experimental treatment that costs exactly what the trust pays annually. Creative math. Mom was frantically scrolling through her phone while dad tried to grab it to see the documents himself. Wesley, are you still claiming you're losing the house? Dad spun toward the screen. The house I paid off in 2008. The remortgage That went straight to Prairie casino. I have the withdrawal records, Wesley. $400,000 in 18 months. Terrible blackjack player, by the way. Annika jumped up, already crying. He was clearly mentally compromised. Ah, Annika, right on schedule. Let me guess. You're about to cry about your infertility. He chuckled to himself. Your abortion was 14 months ago. $3,200 on my credit card. Monica screamed. That's a vicious lie. Also, you're not infertile. You're on birth control. The pills are in your medicine cabinet, behind the vitamins. The funeral home erupted. Now Grandpa's voice continued calmly, my granddaughter, if you're holding guardianship papers right now, and I know you are, because you always want the best for everyone, read page 4, sub section C out loud. My hands trembled as I flipped through the pages. And an irreversible transfer of parental rights. The guardianship was never meant to be permanent. Your mother's friend drafted those. Stand up, Joe. A man in the fifth row reluctantly stood, face bright red. Mom! Was shrieked.

My mother slid a paper across the kitchen table and said, tell the judge your father touched you or you'll never see your little brother again. My parents have been divorcing for three months after dad caught mom with her boss. But this, this something else entirely. I won't get custody without leverage, mom explained. Your father makes 300,000 a year, I make 40. Unless you say this happened, we'll be homeless. My eight year old brother Archie sat next to me eating cereal. I noticed him winces when he reached for his spoon and caught a glimpse of purple bruising under his sleeve. Mom had said he fell off the swings yesterday. I already told Missus Jenkins at school about what your dad did, mom said with a wink and my stomach dropped. Missus Jenkins was the guidance counselor. There's no going back now. Cleo. The thing was I knew exactly what mom was capable of. Last week she'd been drunk by noon and I'd seen her raise her hand toward Archie. So I shoved him into the bathroom with his iPad and locked the door. Then gave mom two of her Xanax and made up a story about breaking her favorite vase to redirect her rage onto me instead. It worked. It always worked when I was there. Archie had whispered to me that night, his small voice breaking, Mommy hurts me when you're at Dad's. I Recorded it on my phone, not knowing what else to do. I've already scheduled therapy appointments for your trauma, she said, sliding more papers across the table. Just stick to the script. The papers had practice questions. Where did he touch you? How often? What did he say to keep you quiet? If you don't do this, mom said, her voice dropping to that dangerous whisper I knew too well. I'll take Archie and disappear. You'll never find us. The threat hit me like ice water. I looked at my little brother, remembering how I'd feel his bruised ribs against my back. He curled up behind me. That night, I lay awake staring at family photos on my phone. Dad teaching me to ride a bike. Dad at every single recital, every soccer game. The next morning I went to dad department. He looked terrible. Hadn't been sleeping, hadn't been eating right. The school called, he said, confused. They asked me if everything was okay at home. They wouldn't tell me what was wrong. Cleo, is someone bullying you? Whatever happens, I'm here for you. I almost broke down right there, almost told him everything. But Archie's bruises flashed in my mind. Mom had scheduled a therapy session that afternoon, but when we got there, I realized that there, this was just her friend, Donna, who used to be a counselor. I hid my phone in my backpack and hit record. The key is details that feel real but can't. Be disproven. Donna coached crying helps practice crying on Q. She actually taught me techniques. Thinking about dead pets, pinching myself where it wouldn't show. The school documentation helps that teacher paying attention to you. Perfect dance of you seeking father figures. My skin crawled as mom practiced my testimony with me. It was summer vacation when I had my innocence torn from me. I wanted to throw up, but I kept recording. That evening, Archie asked me why daddy couldn't come home. Is it because of me, he asked. And I realized it was a lose lose situation. By Friday, mom was escalating the.

So I made sure he saw exactly how much I didn't need him. Uncle Wayne was worth millions but lived like a miser, constantly testing our family to see who was worthy of his money. Every holiday was an audition where cousins would compete for his approval like desperate contestants on a reality show. I leaving everything to whoever proves they don't need it, he'd announce at family dinners while everyone kissed his ass and hung on his every word. My cousins would bring him expensive gifts they couldn't afford, offer to clean his house for free, practically beg for his attention and validation. They'd research his interests and pretend to share his hobbies. My cousin Kyle even switched his major to business because Uncle Wayne mentioned he respected entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, I brought nothing and sat in the corner reading a book, completely disinterested in his little power games. Grace doesn't seem to care about family, he'd say loud enough for me to hear. Testing to see if I'd scramble for his approval like the others. You're right, I'd reply without looking up from my book. I don't care about your money either. This always made him pause. While my cousins were falling over themselves to prove their worth, I was actively proving my indifference. While they fought over who could drive him to appointments and grocery shop for him, I got a second job and Started saving every penny. While they argued about his will, I was building my own future. When they'd ask why I never visited Uncle Wayne, I'd say, as plenty of volunteers, I found his manipulation disgusting. Watching grown adults debase themselves for money made me sick. I'd rather be broke with dignity than rich through desperation. My cousins thought I was crazy. Don't you want financial security? Anna would ask. I'm setting myself up without begging, I'd tell her. While they spent their weekends doing his yard work and running his errands, I was working overtime and taking online courses to improve my skills. While they were buying him birthday presents and Christmas gifts, I was investing in my education and building an emergency fund. The dynamic was fascinating to watch. The more desperate they became for his approval, the more he seemed to enjoy withholding it. The more I ignored him, the more curious he became about me. At family gatherings, he'd try to bait me into conversations about money and success. I'd give polite, brief responses and go back to whatever I was doing. I wasn't rude, but I wasn't performing for him either. Grace, what are your career plans? He'd ask in front of everyone. Working on it, I'd say, simply not elaborating. This drove him crazy because he couldn't figure out my angle. Everyone else was transparent in their attempts to impress him, but I genuinely didn't seem to care about his opinion or his money. The day when did you stop trusting the fun parent. My daughter and her best friend are besties for life. One time I asked my daughter, Maggie, 8, if she wanted to get married. And she said, Mommy, I'm already married to Stacy. Greg, Stacy's dad, was the fun parent who built blanket forts until midnight and made pancakes shaped like their initials. Maggie literally counted down days until her next sleepover there. But then the next invitation came and Maggie said she was too tired, which seemed odd for a kid who never stopped moving. The following week, I found Stacy's mom's invite about Saturday's sleepover crumpled in Maggie's backpack hidden under her library books. When I asked about it, she mumbled something about forgetting and wouldn't look at me. That same day, I found a camera in her bag, one of those expensive digital ones. And when I asked where it came from, she froze. It's for a class project, mom. For what class? I don't know. Just leave me alone, she screamed. It was the first time she had ever raised her voice in weeks. Maggie went from my little tomboy who lived in Dinosaur shirts and thought brushing her hair was optional to suddenly begging for pedicures, asking if she was pretty enough, obsessing over scented lotions at target. She stood in front of the mirror for 20 minutes one morning just staring at herself. And when I asked what she was doing, she said, making Sure I look right. He was 8 when Stacy's mom called about the upcoming sleepover. That Friday, Maggie overheard and started crying so hard she couldn't breathe. Just ran to her room and slammed the door. The next Monday at school pickup changed everything. Greg waved from across the parking lot like always, calling out, hey, Maggie. And my daughter grabbed my hand so tight her nails dug in, hiding her whole body behind me. Her entire body was shaking in the car. She kept checking the mirrors to make sure his car wasn't behind us. She wouldn't wear her favorite Dinosaur shirt anymore, the one she'd worn twice a week for months, saying she needed to look grown up because she was almost an adult. I also noticed she suddenly had money, random dollars in her piggy bank. She couldn't explain. I found it, she'd say. But none of it made sense because an eight year old doesn't just find $50. When my husband and I gently asked if Mister Greg had done something, she shook her head so violently I thought she'd hurt her neck. She just kept saying no, no, no, over and over. More things kept appearing in her room, a magnifying mirror I'd never bought. Concealer from a brand I don't even use so much. Nail polish she could open a salon. And these homemade friendship bracelets, but weird ones with be.

Monica and I were getting married in 10 weeks. I was signing our wedding venue contract when she stopped me. We should date other people before we get married. The pen fell out of my hand. I laughed because I thought she was joking. I'm serious. It will make us stronger. She showed me an article on her phone about open relationships. She had saved it two months ago. Two months she'd been planning this. While I was planning our honeymoon, her phone kept buzzing with texts. She grabbed it and smiled at whatever she was reading. She said we needed to explore ourselves before getting married. She said we'd be more confident in our choice. She even mentioned that her best friend, Jenna, never took risks and had a boring life. The whole time she was talking, her phone kept lighting up with messages. He kept checking them while talking to me. Something was wrong here. Fine. If you think dating others will help us, let's do it. Her face lit up completely. She looked like she'd won something big. She immediately started texting someone back really fast. I could hear her nails clicking on the phone screen. She thought I would just wait at home while she dated other people. She had no idea what was about to happen. What the first date night came. Monica spent three hours getting ready. She wore a brand new black dress. She'd Bought just for tonight. Her coworker Kyle picked her up and she practically ran to his car. Then Jenna called and asked if I wanted to get dinner. Monica said, you guys are opening things up. She said quietly, yeah, she's with Kyle right now. Jenna went silent for a long time. I knew something was happening with them at dinner. Jenna barely touched her food. Monica's been lying to me, too, she said. Remember her work conference last month? She never went. Her hands were shaking. How do you know? I saw her location on Find My Friends. She was at Kyle's apartment the whole weekend. When I asked her about the conference, she gave me all these fake details about sessions she attended. I reached over and touched her hand. She didn't pull away. We should keep this between us, I said. Don't tell anyone about the open relationship. Let Monica think everything's working perfectly. Jenna nodded. We need to document everything she's done, get evidence. We were both angry and hurt. This was about justice. That night, I heard everything through our bedroom wall. Monica had brought Kyle back to our apartment. Every sound, every word, everything. She was completely oblivious that I could hear them. I texted Jenna, can I come over? 20 minutes later, I was on her couch while she made us tea. She doesn't even realize you can hear. Jenna said about the noises. She's too caught up in Kyle to think about Anything else? We spent hours planning how to expose Monica's lies. When I left at 4:00am, she gave me her spare key in case you need to escape again. After that first week, Jenna and I met daily to collect evidence, screenshots of Monica's fake conference receipts, photos from Kyle's social media that proved her lies. She'd bring me lunch when I forgot to eat during our planning sessions. Two sugars? No.

Kimberly stumbled into my office sobbing so hard her whole body shook. Miss Moreno, I'm pregnant, she choked out. My parents will kill me. They'll disown me. I can't tell them. I moved my chair closer and lowered my voice. Breathe with me, in through your nose, out through your mouth. How far along? Four months, she whispered, clutching her oversized hoodie. I kept hoping the tests were wrong. She glanced at her stomach as if it might answer for her. I asked if she'd seen a doctor. She shook her head hard. They'll tell my parents I'm on their insurance. They check every explanation of benefits. They'll know. I slid pamphlets across my desk, adoption resources, local women's clinics and parenthood, and explained options in a neutral voice, pressing the importance of medical care. There are confidential clinics, I said. Sliding scale. No insurance needed. She pushed the papers away. They track my phone. They check my bank. If I'm not where I'm supposed to be, they call the school. Her fear was practical, obsessive. I asked about the father. James is at MIT, she said, voice breaking. He doesn't even know. I documented the conversation, scheduled a follow up and gave her my number. She left clutching two pamphlets. Like talismans, felt uneasy, very aware of how fragile things could go wrong. Kimberly started coming in twice a week. Each visit showed her unraveling. Her face, thinned cheekbones. Sharpened with baggy hoodies, her jeans hung loose despite the roundness at her middle. Are you eating enough, I asked once. I'm fine, she insisted, fingers trembling. Just morning sickness. But morning sickness at 4 in the afternoon, irritability and weight loss and pregnancy set off alarms in my head. I warned her about malnutrition, about risks to the fetus. At our fifth session, she said, I've been researching. Her eyes avoided mine. There are clinics that understand my situation. I explained the danger of unlicensed providers and back alley procedure and marked reputable clinics on the pamphlet. She took them, but I can see she'd already made up her mind. Two weeks later, she arrived frantic. Her hoodie couldn't hide the belly anymore. She looked six months along and exhausted. I found a place, she said. They'll help me and my parents will never know. When I asked for details, name, location, licensing, she deflected, muttering about privacy and special circumstances. I documented everything, appearance, evasive answers, and the clinic she wouldn't name. Let me drive you to Planned Parenthood, I begged. They have counselors, she snapped. I said, I'm fine. Stood up unsteadily and left. She stopped coming. I checked with t. She was still in class, but increasingly unwell.

Steph Jordan, Speith winning majors, Tom Brady winning Super Bowls, Cam Newton as the biggest star in the NFL with his own signature cleats that were doing numbers every week. They sponsored the Cubs were just making inroads everywhere. But the real business success was ignoring New York and LA and basically picking the other 48 flyover states that Nike and Adidas did not care about at all. They embrace hunting and rural lifestyle and youth sports and went so hard on their DNA, which was this click clack, really agro, really focused in football. Nike and Adidas strategy had always been going after teen athletes, under armour just went younger. They went after the ten year old athlete and every kid from five to 10 years old was wearing under armour because you know what, eventually 10 year olds become 13 years old and 17 years old and 25 year old. And I'm glad they were because look.

I worked in marketing for a long time at Nike across American football, American basketball, Nike women. You wanna know some of the craziest differences between athletes at the highest level in America and athletes on these global stages? In soccer, these Fools will actually wear the key colorway of all the latest soccer cleats and boots. I'm American. We call them cleats. The key colorway from a company is usually a bright color that they've LED with to try to stand out amongst the crowd. Nike's using this bright orange. A bright orange. And there's this pink here. Puma had this purple colorway. Adidas has this blue, red, white. Different combo. And in America, it's like pulling teeth trying to get American athletes to wear the latest and greatest in innovation in footwear. In American football, the favorite cleat of most football players is literally cleat made in 2014. And they go on eBay for like 500 bucks. Pros will literally wear them at the highest level.

I worked in marketing for a long time at Nike across American football, American basketball, Nike women. You wanna know some of the craziest differences between athletes at the highest level in America and athletes on these global stages? In soccer, these Fools will actually wear the key colorway of all the latest soccer cleats and boots. I'm American. We call them cleats. The key colorway from a company is usually a bright color that they've LED with to try to stand out amongst the crowd. Nike's using this bright orange. A bright orange. And there's this pink here. Puma had this purple colorway. Adidas has this blue, red, white. Different combo. And in America, it's like pulling teeth trying to get American athletes to wear the latest and greatest in innovation in footwear. In American football, the favorite cleat of most football players is literally cleat made in 2014. And they go on eBay for like 500 bucks. Pros will literally wear them at the highest level.

He was top 10 in passing in the Big 12. But yesterday was just announced that Jake is transferring from BYU because he got suspended for violating the honor code. This is all happening because Jake has an ongoing lawsuit where a Jane Doe alleges that Jake hmm her and also strangled her, which of course is a very serious accusation in and of itself. But here's where things get pretty interesting and it's a lose lose for Jake. First and foremost, if he did do that and that story is true, he deserves everything that's coming to him. But Jake is saying that he did not hmm her and everything that they did was 100% consensual. But because he is saying that it was consensual, he is admitting to having premarital activities, which is a direct violation of BYU's Code of honor because Mormon though on top of the ongoing lawsuit that's happening, he's also getting suspended from BYU because he admitted to having these premarital activities. Apparently, this all happened in November of 2023 and then in February of 2024, they were exchanging like hearted.

The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to Cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of him. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sits At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55.

And I just know Saban's at his 20 million dollar mansion in Florida right now going, hey, told you so. Should have listened to me. Cause this week, Tennessee's quarterback Nico Ealy, had a holdout because he wanted more NIL money. And it was just reported this morning that Tennessee is gonna be moving on from the guy. So basically, here's what's happening this year. Nico was slated to make $2.4 million from Tennessee's collective. But apparently that wasn't enough for Nico. And he saw Carson Beck go from Georgia to Florida, and he's getting 4 million. So basically, stopped showing up to practice and meetings and was holding out hoping that Tennessee would give him four million dollars. Long story short, Tennessee said no. I mean, to be fair, Nico, like Tennessee's mascot, is the volunteers. He kind of knew what you signed up for. All jokes aside, though, this is kind of an insane move. And to me, the only logical explanation behind this is that Nico's camp just thinks he's not gonna succeed in the NFL. So they're trying to get him as much money as possible right now.

So this fellow right here, his name is David Booth. And David here founded a hedge fund that just so happens to manage about a trillion dollars. And David's been thinking a lot recently, you know what, I love Kansas so much, I'm gonna give them $300 million, the single largest donation in college sports history. In fact, he's such a big donor for Kansas, they renamed their stadium after the guy. They call it the booth. And for anyone who's saying that this is just for new locker rooms or new stadiums, it's full of shit. Yes, Kansas said they're gonna use 75 million of that 300 to finish the stadium, but the other 225 million, where do you think that's going? This is an NFL war chest that they're gonna be using for new talent. And the recruiting and transfer portal is gonna look like this next year because now Kansas has a fuck ton of money and nowhere to spend it. And it's once again proving that college football is a pay to win game. Now, if you wanna win the Big 12 as much as David does here, Baylor better put 301.

He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term, they can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team and he's actually been practicing with Texas a m. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL cause 1, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible, but not like.

He was top 10 in passing in the Big 12. But yesterday was just announced that Jake is transferring from BYU because he got suspended for violating the honor code. This is all happening because Jake has an ongoing lawsuit where a Jane Doe alleges that Jake hmm her and also strangled her, which, of course, is a very serious accusation in and of itself. But here's where things get pretty interesting, and it's a lose lose for Jake. First and foremost, if he did do that, and that story is true, he deserves everything that's coming to him. But Jake is saying that he did not hmm her, and everything that they did was 100% consensual. But because he is saying that it was consensual, he is admitting to having premarital activities, which is a direct violation of BYU's Code of honor because Mormon. Though on top of the ongoing lawsuit that's happening, he's also getting suspended from BYU because he admitted to having these premarital activities. Apparently, this all happened in November of 2023 and then in February of 2020.

You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt and then third string they got Trey Lance.

And I just know Saban's at his 20 million dollar mansion in Florida right now going, hey, told you so. Should have listened to me. Cause this week, Tennessee's quarterback Nico Ealy, had a holdout because he wanted more NIL money. And it was just reported this morning that Tennessee is gonna be moving on from the guy. So basically, here's what's happening this year. Nico was slated to make $2.4 million from Tennessee's collective. But apparently that wasn't enough for Nico. And he saw Carson Beck go from Georgia to Florida, and he's getting 4 million. So basically, stopped showing up to practice and meetings and was holding out hoping that Tennessee would give him four million dollars. Long story short, Tennessee said no. I mean, to be fair, Nico, like Tennessee's mascot, is the volunteers. He kind of knew what you signed up for. All jokes aside, though, this is kind of an insane move. And to me, the only logical explanation behind this is that Nico's camp just thinks he's not gonna succeed in the NFL, so they're trying to get him as much money as possible.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you wanna know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 / 4 and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of it. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt and although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. So today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sits at 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the

But Shamar here is the only first round pick to not have signed his rookie contract yet because the Bengals are trying to shaft him. this dispute happening with Shamar in the Bengals isn't about money. He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing is cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term, they can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team and he's actually been practicing with Texas a m. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL because 1, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible but not likely. No. 2, he could ask for a.

So this man right here is Shamar Stuart from Texas A&M. He was drafted 17th overall by the Bengals this year. But Shamar here is the only first round pick to not have signed his rookie contract yet. Because the Bengals are trying to shaft him. this dispute happening with Shamar in the Bengals isn't about money. He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing is cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term. They can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team, and he's actually been practicing with Texas A M. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL, because one, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible, but not likely.

Last year, Nico played for Tennessee, which is one of the best teams in the SEC. And this guy actually LED Tennessee to the College Football Playoffs. They were 10 and 3, and they lost in the first round. But at the end of last season, Nico wanted about $4 million in nil money, even though he was already slatted to make about 2.2 million a year. And mind you, this kid had Tennessee by the balls. He was gonna be their starting quarterback for the next two years. But for whatever reason, he transferred to UCLA out of the SEC for less money. And as you can imagine, Tennessee fans were pissed. So Nico thought the grass would be a whole lot greener at UCLA. Well, come to find out, it's not, because UCLA is now 0 and 3 to start the season. And they got blown out last night by New Mexico, who they paid $1.2 million to play. Which was at home, by the way. And this is what the crowd looked like. There's nobody there. Meanwhile.

Malavea had a holdout because he wanted more nil money. And it was just reported this morning that Tennessee is gonna be moving on from the guy. So basically, here's what's happening. This year, Nico was slated to make $2.4 million from Tennessee's collective, but apparently that wasn't enough for Nico and he saw Carson Beck go from Georgia to Florida and he's getting 4 million. So basically stopped showing up to practice and meetings and was holding out hoping that Tennessee would give him $4 million. Long story short, Tennessee said no. I mean, to be fair, Nico, like Tennessee's mascot is the volunteers. He kind of knew what you signed up for. All jokes aside, though, this is kind of an insane move. And to me, the only logical explanation behind this is that Nico's camp just thinks he's not gonna succeed in the NFL, so they're trying to get him as much money as possible, right?

But let's actually be tactical and analytical about this, because this competition is going to be won and lost. In the hot dog portion. Obviously we have Joey, who's the undisputed Glizzy Goblin. He's putting down a hot dog in about 1.2 seconds. Before you saying this is where he's gonna struggle. I think after people see Joey eat a hot dog, they underestimate how fucking hard it is to finish an entire hot dog with a bun. I literally just saw an average Joe try to do this. He finished one hot dog in about 30 seconds. I'm going to be super generous to you saying here, because he's a competitor and a superhuman, and say he finishes one dog in 15 seconds. That gives Joey a 13.8 second head start on the hundred meter. Now, of course, regardless of the hot dog portion, Usain is going to absolutely cook Joe.

Now, for those of you who don't know football rules, this little white line here is reserved for the referee and the referee only. And right here is where all the players should be. And when a big play like this happens, the ref is running down that white strip. And a lot of the time, if players get close to that white strip, the refs will issue a warning to the sideline. But this time, Parker got in the way of the ref and actually made contact with him, which caused the ref to throw a penalty flag on Parker Jones in the sideline, costing Georgia 15 yards. And now millions of people are blaming this guy for Georgia losing the Sugar Bowl. They're using him as a scapegoat to just cope with the fact that Georgia didn't play well enough to win the game. Was it stupid? Absolutely. You gotta be.

But come to find out that this tradition all started in college when Pat got Brittany a dog and named it steel after the Steelers. So when you really think about it, this whole naming tradition of a hall of Fame quarterback came from the Steelers. So they have a dog named steel, then they got another dog, named it silver, and they just said, shit, I love metal. And now their three kids are also named after metal.

Because the Bengals are trying to shaft him. this dispute happening with Shamar in the Bengals isn't about money. He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing is cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term. They can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team, and he's actually been practicing with Texas A M. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL, because one, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible, but not likely.

I would imagine Steve met this woman when he was dressed up in the marching band for the Ravens for some reason. But in this viral post, the guy attached a video of him allegedly talking to Steve and he said, hey, Steve, I know you're, hmm, my wife. And Steve goes, sorry. Now, of course, that pissed the husband off and he started going on a tirade cause Steve here is known as a family man. He's got a wife and 4 kids, always with his wife at events. He's a family guy. Well, it turns out that Steve is a freak. The wife here had Steve disguised as 3 in her phone. And here's just one text thread between the two of them, allegedly. And I mean, Jesus, Steve, boy, these two were texting all the time. He's sending selfies to her. I mean, Jesus. And then the husband proceeded to go into his wife's Facebook account and then post this with all the.

But the kickoff team consists of Ed Reed, Ray Lewis, Luke Kinkle, Brian Irackle, Brian Dawkins, Lawrence Taylor, John Lynch, Ronnie Lot, Troy Palamalu, and JJ Watt, all in their primes. Plus a kicker. And I should mention, in the scenario, your return team is the starting kickoff return team for Vanderbilt. I'm gonna make this as simple as possible, all right? Very simple. You don't need to score. Touchdown. You don't need to score a yard. You can go backwards. I don't give a shit. The only thing you can't do is take a knee or call a fair catch. Same thing. And you can't fumble. That's it? Well, I'm just gonna dive so that they can't hit me. That counts as a knee. Also, you can't run out of bounds or run into the back of your end zone because you're afraid. You have to actually try and score a touchdown. Even though you're not. In this scenario, I don't care.

And it was just reported this morning that Tennessee is gonna be moving on from the guy. So basically here's what's happening. This year, Nico was slated to make $2.4 million from Tennessee's collective, but apparently that wasn't enough for Nico. And he saw Carson Beck go from Georgia to Florida and he's getting 4 million. So basically stopped showing up to practice and meetings and was holding out hoping that Tennessee would give him $4 million. Long story short, Tennessee said no. I mean, to be fair, Nico, like Tennessee's mascot is the volunteers. He kind of knew what you signed up for. All jokes aside, though, this is kind of an insane move.

This is all happening because Jake has an ongoing lawsuit where a Jane Doe alleges that Jake hmm her and also strangled her, which, of course, is a very serious accusation in and of itself. But here's where things get pretty interesting, and it's a lose lose for Jake. First and foremost, if he did do that, and that story is true, he deserves everything that's coming to him. But Jake is saying that he did not hmm her, and everything that they did was 100% consensual. But because he is saying that it was consensual, he is admitting to having premarital activities, which is a direct violation of BYU's Code of honor because Mormon. Though on top of the ongoing lawsuit that's happening, he's also getting suspended from BYU because he admitted to having these premarital activities. Apparently, this all happened in November of 2023, and then in February of 20

College football season starts this Saturday and one of the games is Delaware State at Hawaii. Now as you can imagine, geographically, Delaware is a pretty far away from Hawaii. And to be exact, it's about a ten and a half hour flight. So Delaware State being smart, they said, hey, we're gonna leave on Tuesday morning. It's ten and a half hour flight to Hawaii. That way everyone could get acclimated, they can get in a routine and we can start practicing over there for our game on Saturday. Well, we got bad news. This Hawaii football reporter said, Delaware State spokeswoman confirms Hornets missed today's ten and a/2 hour flight to Honolulu because of a bus snafu the JFK airport. And clearly nobody has any idea what the hell is going on or what they're gonna do because the spokesperson said we're working on a plane. Now I can't even begin to imagine how hard it is to find a plane that will fit an entire team of football players going to Hawaii of all places. Now, as of this picture, Hawaii is favored by 39 points. And with all of this happening, I'm only going to assume that Hawaii.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys and if you want to know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by four and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to Cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of him. But what he did today takes the care. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man Dak Prescott who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt and then third string they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt and although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line and in Cooper's contract there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he Sits at 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays.

Their number, exactly the same. Their colors exactly the same. Even the sleeves that they wear during games, exactly the same. Your pre game warm up hype routine, exactly the same.

So this fellow right here, his name is David Booth and David here founded a hedge fund that just so happens to manage about a trillion dollars. And David's been thinking a lot recently, you know what, I love Kansas so much, I'm gonna give them $300 million, the single largest donation in college sports history. In fact, he's such a big donor for Kansas, they renamed their stadium after the guy. They call it the booth. And for anyone who's saying that this is just for new locker rooms or new stadiums, it's full of shit. Yes, Kansas said they're gonna use 75 million of that 300 to finish the stadium, but the other 225 million, where do you think that's going? This is an NFL war chest that they're gonna be using for new talent. And the recruiting and transfer portal is gonna look like this next year because now Kansas has a fuck ton of money and nowhere to spend it. And it's once again proving that college football is a pay to win game. Now, if you wanna win the Big 12 as much as David does here, Baylor better put 300.

In the first two weeks of the NFL season, we've seen not one but two separate quarterbacks who have turf toe, and they're gonna be out for a while. No. 1 yesterday, obviously being Joe Burrow because he doesn't have an offensive line. And No. 2 last week, Brock Purdy. Like Joe Burrow's about to be out for three months because of this toe injury. But what in the hell is turf toe? apparently it's a very excruciating injury with a cute little nickname. So basically what turf toe is, is when you bend your big toe back so far, all the stuff that holds the joint together, either one gets stretched or torn. And it's this little joint slash ligament thing right here in your toe. But the best way to describe it is like this, imagine taking your thumb and bending it straight back until it snaps. Now, 1, I'm no doctor, and 2, I've never had turf toe, but from what everyone says, every single time you take a step and you have turf toe, it feels like someone is taking a knife and jamming it under your toenail every single step. So as you can imagine, it is not a pleasant injury whatsoever. And I think I gotta start a petition to rename.

I would imagine Steve met this woman when he was dressed up in the marching band for the Ravens for some reason. But in this viral post, the guy attached a video of him allegedly talking to Steve and he said, hey, Steve, I know you're, hmm, my wife. And Steve goes, sorry. Now, of course, that pissed the husband off and he started going on a tirade cause Steve here is known as a family man. He's got a wife and 4 kids, always with his wife at events. He's a family guy. Well, it turns out that Steve is a freak. The wife here had Steve disguised as 3 in her phone. And here's just one text thread between the two of them, allegedly.

Well, it was just announced yesterday that this guy has had enough of the flag planting at Ohio Stadium. So this guy right here is Josh Williams, and he's a state representative for Ohio. And yesterday he announced a new Bill for the state of Ohio that would make flag planting in Ohio a felony. This man is so tired of Ohio State losing and the other team planting a flag at midfield that he wants to make it illegal and a felony nonetheless. Thanks, Baker Mayfield. The Bill would prohibit planting a flagpole and flag in the center of the Ohio Stadium football field on the day of a college football game. And to name this act the O H I O. Sportsmanship Act. Notably, this Bill specifically references Ohio Stadium, so would not include flag planting at all.

So the man you're looking at right here, his name is Parker Jones and he's a walk on red shirt sophomore for Georgia football. And yesterday, Georgia was playing Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl. Now, during this game, Georgia had a pretty big play, the guys running down the sidelines. But guess who was celebrating while he was running down the sidelines? Parker Jones. Now, for those of you who don't know football rules, this little white line here is reserved for the referee and the referee only. And right here is where all the players should be. And when a big play like this happens, the ref is running down that white strip. And a lot of the time if players get close to that white strip, the refs will issue a warning to the sideline. But this time, Parker got in the way of the ref and actually made contact with him, which caused the ref to throw a penalty flag on Parker Jones in the sideline, costing Georgia 15 yards. And now millions of people are blaming this guy for Georgia losing the Sugar Bowl. They're using him as a scapegoat to just cope with the fact that Georgia didn't play well enough to win the game. Was it stupid? Absolutely. You gotta be better than that. But I mean, you can't tell me.

So this here is Alvin Henderson and he is a four star recruit out of Elba, Alabama. Now he's committed to Auburn. And this man is 5 foot 9, 200 pounds and a running back. So obviously last night, it's early in the season, Friday Night Lights, Alvin takes the field to win this game versus Mackenzie. Alvin had 40 carries for 435 fucking yards and 10 touchdowns. 435 yards and 10 touchdowns. Some kids don't even do this in a season. If I started NCAA 25 and put Georgia versus Toledo, I don't think I could do this. So seeing that he had 40 carries for 435 yards and 10 touchdowns, you're probably like, damn, they must have beat the shit out of the other team, right? Yeah. So, uh, no, they lost the game. The final score of this high school football game was 80 to 78, 158 points scored in a single game. Now granted this game did go into overtime, but 158 points in one game is preposterous. But with this performance out.

So this fellow right here, his name is David Booth and David here founded a hedge fund that just so happens to manage about a trillion dollars. And David's been thinking a lot recently, you know what, I love Kansas so much, I'm gonna give them $300 million, the single largest donation in college sports history. In fact, he's such a big donor for Kansas, they renamed their stadium after the guy. They call it the booth. And for anyone who's saying that this is just for new locker rooms or new stadiums, it's full of shit. Yes, Kansas said they're gonna use 75 million of that 300 to finish the stadium, but the other 225 million, where do you think that's going? This is an NFL war chest that they're gonna be using for new talent. And the recruiting and transfer portal is gonna look like this next year because now Kansas has a fuck ton of money and nowhere to spend it. And it's once again proving that college football is a pay to win game. Now, if you wanna win the Big 12 as much as David does here, Baylor better put 300.

No. 1, gonna go with left tackle. There's a very clear reason these guys are paid so much in the NFL. Protecting the quarterback's blindside is the most important thing you can do on offense. You can't protect your quarterback. Your offense is done. Without offense, you're gonna be a pretty bad team. To put this in perspective, let's go on the flip side. Defensive ends, if they get a couple sacks a year, they're great. But an o tackle, if he gives up a couple sacks, he's trash. That tackles really can't afford to mess up because their team is riding on them. No.2, I'm gonna go corner. To play corner, you have to be one of the most gifted players on the field. He's an athletic freak. Not only do you just have to be fast, you have to be quick, nimble and willing to hit. Going out there every play and guarding Ryan Williams or Jeremiah Smith is no joke. Sometimes you're gonna do that with absolutely no help. It's not even fair. Yes, the great corners can do it, but cut the rest some slack. Corners hard. No. 3 is quarterback, the hardest position in football. Not only you have to master your offensive playbook, you have to master the defenses game plan every single week. You have to know what front they're running, what coverage When they're switching, when they're rolling, when they're blitzing.

Let's go and get the video popping. Let's go, man! Coming in at No. 1. For starters, bro, the chin strap is poor quality. Can't lie bro, as much as it is straight up cool to zip up your chin strap, I can't lie bro, this helmet is lacking some of the sturdiness and durability when it comes to the chin strap. With this chin strap bro, you really don't have the capabilities of changing it either. Like bro, you're literally stuck with this chin strap for good the whole entire season and don't even try to adjust this chin strap because the more you try to adjust it, the worse it gets bro. Honestly bro, when you first get a speed flex, it might be cool to have up that zip up feature when it comes to the chin strap, but over the course of time. Bro, the wear and tear on this chin strap is insane. don't even get me started on trying to take this chin strap off. Good luck. You're better off just getting a new helmet at that point. Just dealing with these screws at the top. Coming in at number two. We have the weight I'm not gonna lie brother, speed flex is a heavy ass helmet. Bro. Honestly bro, I. Could you not? Bro, trying to break this helmet in is insane. Do you literally feel like you're wearing a bobble head at that point? Bro, imagine trying to get in a 3 point.

When told to leave again, she got physical. Ripped out his dreads, destroyed his crib. A man's had a join, Taper, Fade Nation.

You can't hire your own personal driver or drive your own car anyway. He also wanted his family's hotel and travel cost covered for all of the 10 games and he wanted medical injury time off after playing to be determined by him and his family. He was asking for a lot to be at A&M and three months later he's hitting the portal again. It's just crazy. This is gonna be a second transfer this offseason, but who knows?

The Eagles up top in the green, and the Chiefs at the bottom in red. And then last year, we had the Forty Niners and the Chiefs. The Forty Niners at the top in the red and then purple for Taylor Swift, because she was the main topic at this time. And then this year, the Super Bowl that happened yesterday, we had the Chiefs and the Eagles. The Chiefs up at the top in the red, and the Eagles at the bottom in the green. And now next year, in 2026, this is what we have. And there are a lot of colors they're making a little bit harder on us. But I still see two teams. And those two teams are the Lions and the Ravens. The blue at the top of the Lions and the bottom, purplish color for the Ravens. And I know some people are saying Packers because green and yellow, this and that, but I see Lions and Ravens, I really do. And if you guys haven't followed my YouTube yet? Make sure you do, Bryce the girl at NFL underscore combo. I'm starting to post on there a lot and I'm only gonna be more active. I'd appreciate it a lot, but it

This is obviously a no brainer. We got the Speed Flex. Never. The ride on Speed Flex 1st was released. It was everybody's dream to be able to try on this helmet for. This is one of those helmets that is so unique it is one of the most satisfying things to hear those clicks when you're zipping up your chin strap. Not only that, every position looks really good in this helmet. It has excellent Protection, it is super comfortable, and it looks super drippy bro. What more can you ask for? Beginning at number two we have the ride O speed. This helmet may not be as good as the speed flex, but it will get the job done. Honestly bro, what makes the speed super nice is that it feels lighter than the speed flex. Honestly bro, this is one of those helmets that you can literally make one of the drippiest looking helmets on the football field. Last but not least, we have the Ryde L Exo nom. Obviously new technology has been making helmet 10 times better. This is one of those helmets that stands out on the field. And honestly bro, this is one of those helmets that Give you the most vision out of the list. Strong head. One of the hardest things to do in football is lift.

And then you add the best player in the world in Kylian Mbappe. Say what you want about Kevin Durant, I'll probably agree with you, but at least with KD, he was a seamless fit on the warriors. He could immediately slide in and impact winning and be a perfect fit for their system. Mbappe, you can't say the same for. Killian's best position is left wing. And the guy on Real Madrid who plays that position is at worst a top 5 player in the world in Vinicius Junior. And the striker, his running mate is Rodrigo. I don't know how any of these guys are gonna be okay with Kylian Mbappe stepping in and trying to take some of that space.

Two, if you and your position coach don't get along, it's time to go, because odds are he's already looking to replace you. This could also mean that he gives other players opportunities he wouldn't normally give them instead of giving them to you, even if you're the better player.

Bro, if you're a linebacker and you're starting, bro, you actually get in the game, bro, you haven't had a concussion yet wearing this helmet, bravo to you. But, bro, if you're a linebacker, just try to stay away from this helmet. But No. 2, we got quarterbacks and cowboy colors. Listen, man, you would think this is common sense, bro. Look, the linebackers, they, they deserve the cowboy colors. But, bro, you'll find some quarterbacks rocking these. If you're a quarterback and you have a cowboy color, you better be cracking domes on the field. Otherwise, what is the point? Last but not least, we got a lineman with little shoulder pads. Listen, man, it's every lineman's dream to own a pair of little shoulder pads. But, bro, if they're this small, bro, you don't have any Protection.

Like, you're really telling me Patrick Mahomes is 28 years old and Joe Burrow is 27? I'm not even gonna lie, I knew Patrick was 28. I really thought burrow was 25, 26 at the max. I mean, even if you look when they got drafted, Mahomes was drafted in 2017, Joe Burrow was drafted in 2020. And I know there's some crazy age gaps in the NFL, but I just found out this one this morning and I am in shock. I mean, these two guys are really one year apart. And look at the type of careers they've had. Mahomes has played 96 games, Joe Burrow has played 52. So Mahomes is almost doubling him. And obviously he's played more games, so these stats don't even compare. Mahomes blows him out and almost everything outside of completion percentage and interceptions. And let's cover up those awards because that's embarrassing for Joe Burrow. Either way, I'm just in shock. I truly didn't know this at all. And I've always said that Joe Burrow is gonna be the damn Marino of this era. A great quarterback, has great stats, but he never gets a ring. And obviously he still has a long career left that can change. But man, this is wild.

Here's the play, if you haven't seen it, which I'm guessing you have. Fourth and 20, Mills buying some time, fires towards the end zone and it is caught. Oh, my word. Improbable. With Houston scoring that touchdown and winning this game against the Colts, it locked in the No. 1 pick for the Chicago Bears in last year's draft. And we all know what happened with that. A pick swap with the Panthers, a second round pick, this year's first round pick, next year's second round pick in DJ Moore. And the talk of the town and the biggest thing on that list is this year's first round pick, because now the Chicago Bears sit with the first overall pick in the draft once again. And any route they take can absolutely change their franchise thanks to this play right here. The Carolina Panthers for trading and the Carolina.

But in the NFC, that's not the case. There's very few Qbs, if any, you can point to in this conference that are true game elevators. The reason some of these teams are successful is because they're extremely well rounded rosters that have LED to their quarterbacks getting overpaid and their flaws getting exposed come playoff time.

No meddling, no owner for years. I always saw it as a weakness. Now I see it as a strength. Three straight quarterbacks. Star, star, star. All three farves in the hall of Fame. Rodgers will be and love looks like he's on his way. Think it's a coincidence Aaron Rodgers is 4 and 11 and now irrelevant? You think it's a coincidence that Sam Donald is having an unbelievable year? And in Carolina, in the Jets he was a tire fire? Aaron could have played earlier. Jordan Love could have played earlier. But if you're just about football. No meddling, no ego, no impulsive crazy person. 37th playoff appearance, No.1 all time for the smallest market in the NFL, surpassing Dallas. Who is? Jerry's aged, has regressed badly and his need

And the answer is he had him from Day 1 and his name was Tyreek Hill. Matthew Stafford walked into Detroit and his best wide receiver from Day 1 was Calvin Johnson. Sure, the Lions weren't world beaters, but they immediately locked down their QB receiver duo for the future. Philip Rivers was drafted to the Chargers in 2004 and from day one his best receiving target was Antonio Gates. Not to mention prime Malcolm Thomas in the backfield. Holmes hasn't gotten an ounce of sympathy from NFL fans in the media because he inherited the greatest offensive cheat code of the late 20 in Tyreek Hill and arguably the greatest pass catching tight end in Travis Kelce. But every QB goes through a phase where they have a lot of weapons and then they don't. I think Tom Brady is a great example of this. And Mahomes actually did this in his last two Super Bowl wins. Tom didn't start with the great offense then got Randy Moss, but was still able to win at the highest level after Randy's departure with guys like Julian Edelman, Danny Amendola, and Jake Hogan. Of course Rob Gronkowski. Does Lamar have the better offensive support?

I think at quarterback, Patrick Mahomes retired today. He's a hall of Famer. I think Aaron Rodgers, I always like better than Farve, is a slam dunk hall of Famer. Travis Kelsey could retire today. He's in. So is his brother Jason. At center, Trent Williams, maybe the best left tackle ever. He is on a short list. Aaron Donald, again, second best interior d lineman I've ever seen to Reggie White and it's close. Miles Garrett and Von Miller on the edge. They just play different and look different. Bobby Wagner has been a nine time all Pro. He's a hall of Famer. And Justin Tucker, the six or seven players to me that look like it's the waiting room. Joe Burrow is just different. He can go toe to toe with Mahomes and he doesn't feel inferior. Justin Jefferson is, is. Randy Moss to me like one of those level players. I think Nick Bosa, the edge for the Niners, Micah Parsons.

His mom was Gloria Vanderbilt. And what a life she had. Her father, Reginald Vanderbilt, was the great grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt, who made all the money. This guy spent money like it was water. Gambled, he drank hard. He was in the streets. After his first marriage failed, he met this young thing, Gloria Mercedes Morgan. She was only 17. He was, like, 41. Gloria was a twin. She had a sister named Letty, who was the mistress of the Prince of Wales, later known to be Edward the eighth. This is the guy that abdicated his throne for Wallace Simpson. So Reginald Vanderbilt marries Gloria Morgan, and together they have one daughter, Gloria Vanderbilt. Like most wealthy children from her day, she was raised mostly by nannies. This is Dodo, who she considered her real mom. When Gloria was 18 months old, her father Reginald passed away from cirrhosis of the liver. This left baby Gloria and her older half sister an inheritance worth about $44 million each in today's money. Her mom is now a very young widow. 1819, and she's in charge of Gloria's money. So they moved to France. Mama, Gloria is just living it up, okay? She's rich, she's young, she's widow. She's partying like a rock star. She's the Belle of the ball. All the men want her. Long story short, one day, she overhears her mom and her aunt talking about how they're Gonna get rid of Dodo, her nanny. Baby Gloria is freaking out, okay? Dodo is like her mom. So Nanny Dodo and her maternal grandmother catch a plan. They're thinking Gloria is an American heiress, and she needs to be back in the U S. They run to Gloria's aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt. She was the sister of Reginald. And they're spilling all the tea. They're like, you know what? She's spending all this money. And Gertrude is like, what? Let me get custody of this girl. Let me control her finances. Boom! A huge custody trial begins, and it is sensational for the time, okay? Because this was during the depression. Everyone's barely making ends meet, and here are these wealthy socialites arguing back and forth about custody. It was salacious. Baby Gloria is crying. The nanny is accusing her mom of sleeping with other women. It was headline news. At the end of the trial, the court awards custody to her aunt. So she's staying with her aunt during the weekdays, and she goes to visit her mom on the weekends. But guess what? They fired Dodo anyway. Gloria finally has some structure to her life. She's going to school, she's going to church. Then when she turned 17 years old, she decided she was gonna go visit her mom, who lived in Los Angeles at the time. It was supposed to be a few weeks, but Gloria was star struck. She loved movie stars. She started dating Errol Flynn. She's painting the town red. She has no supervision. She's 17. She's loving the limelight. So she writes to her aunt and says, you know what? I'm not coming back. I'm gonna live here forever. And Gertrude, she's not happy. But what can she do? Gloria's 17 and she's dating people like Howard Hughes. Who didn't date Howard Hughes? Then she meets this guy, Pat Desico. He was an agent, but really he was a mobster. Pat had been married to Thelma Todd, who passed away under mysterious circumstances. I've done a video about her. But Gloria, she's young and naive. So she ends up marrying this guy, and he is abusive towards her. He calls her Fatsy Rue, and he hits her. After about four years, they get divorced. And then she meets Leopold Stokowski, who's 40 years her senior. He was a world renowned conductor, and he thought Gloria was it. She was 21, he was 60 something. They got married. They had two sons, Leopold and Christopher. Gloria is a devoted housewife and she's raising her children. And she basically says, you know what? I was looking for a father, and Leopold was it. At this time, she would listen to everything he said. And when he told her, your mother doesn't love you, Gloria cut her mother off financially. But Gloria was still young and she had hopes and dreams. She wanted to be an actress. He didn't really like that, so they drifted apart. And She began to date Frank Sinatra. She knew it wouldn't last, but it was her way of getting away from her husband. So after 10 years, they divorced. The very next year, she met Sidney Lumet, a film director. They fell in love, they got married. But they stayed together only for about seven years. Gloria says he wanted children, but she wasn't ready to give him any. The next year, she met Wyatt Cooper, who was an author and a screenwriter. They fell in love, got married together. They had sons, Carter and Anderson Cooper. Gloria and Wyatt were in love. Wyatt really stabilized Gloria. He basically taught her how to have a family. They were a blended family. Here she is with all four of her sons. But later, in his 20s, her son Christopher decided he wanted nothing to do with her or her family. Around this time, Gloria decided to mend her relationship with her mother. Gloria, this is a picture of Leopold and his grandmother. Sadly, at the age of 50, Wyatt Cooper passed away during an open heart surgery. Carter was only 12 and Anderson was ten. Gloria is now a single mother, and she's got to reinvent herself. She's an artist, she's a designer, she's a Hustler. And then she becomes a Jean designer. Gloria Vanderbilt jeans. Then tragedy struck again. Ten years after Wyatt passed away, Carter Cooper unalived himself in front of his mother. He was only 23. Anderson often talk

This is Michelle Hempstead. Michelle had two dogs, a Rottweiler and a Pomeranian. Apparently, these two were great friends. In fact, the Pomeranian usually kind of took control, was kind of in charge of the Rottweiler. Even on July 29th of 2024, Michelle was feeding the two out of a 20 piece McDonald's chicken nugget. Usually, this was no problem. Sometimes she allegedly would even put a nugget or some food in her mouth and feed it straight to her Rottweiler. In particular, the palm and the Rottweiler had their own little thing. The Rottweiler, named Trig, would kind of do this chomp thing when he was telling palm, the Pomeranian, that he was gonna get the chicken nugget that she would throw up in the air for them. If palm wanted to get it, then palm would make a little snip and noise that would let Trig know that he wanted it. This time, however, both of them jumped for it. Neither one of them took the cue of the other. They got into a little fight. Michelle wanted to stop the fight, so she got in the middle of it. And while doing that, Trig clamped down on her arm. He unfortunately severed an artery. Now, Michelle got out of the situation, crawled over her balcony and towards the park for help. But unfortunately, she lost too much blood too fast, and she lost her life. What's Even sadder is just four weeks before this, in June, Michelle had just lost her daughter. Now, since Michelle was the sole owner of these two dogs, and she is now passed, the dogs were seized and disclaimed for destruction, meaning that now that they didn't have an aunt and owner, or they weren't claimed, they could now be put to sleep.

And we now have the results of the polygraph test that were given because of their disappearance. According to the court documents, their mother, Malaya passed the polygraph test as well as their stepfather Daniel. Their step grandmother Jamie also took a polygraph test. However, they said she wasn't suitable for it and they could not render an answer. Since their disappearance, there has been an extensive search for these children. And really the only material things that have been found is Lily's blanket that was about a kilometer from the family home on a tree. And they also found a piece of her blanket at the end of the driveway in a trash bag. There was also a potential footprint that police found. However, nothing came from it. If you haven't heard of this case, here is a quick timeline. Monday, April 28th and Tuesday, April 29th, both Lily and Jack went to school. Wednesday was a stay at home day. They didn't have school. And then Thursday, May 1st, around 6:00am, their mother messaged the school and said that Lily and Jack would not be going. She claimed that Lily had a cough. 2:25 That same day was the last verifiable sighting of Lily and Jack. They were seen on surveillance camera at a dollarama at night. The kids were put to bed in The same clothes they had on that day. And Jack had a diaper because he wasn't fully potty trained. The following day, May 2nd, Malaya, their mother, contacted the school again and said they would be staying home. At some point, Lily and Jack wake up and then Daniel and Malaya were in their bedroom. She said they were in and out of sleep. She was feeding the baby because they also have a child together. Lily pops into the room and they're hearing the children and then all of a sudden it's silent. At 10:01, Malaya calls the police and says she believes her children wandered away from the home. She said both children are possibly autistic. Apparently, they noticed that the kids boots were gone and Daniel decides to get in his vehicle, drive around and try to find the kids. And this is all what's being claimed by the parents. He said he went all around looking for them and that he didn't take his phone and he didn't even check the phone for the time. He was just searching for the kids.

Then you know what you do? I literally do not. Either they pay, or you're going to call the cops and report them for theft of services. Since you skipped all of that boring, time consuming talk about budget at the beginning of the appointment and instead went on to do any and all services that you deem necessary to give them the dream hair that they. Yes, they asked for. Services have now been rendered, and it is theft of services. And when they try to be like, but the price wasn't disclosed at the beginning, I didn't know it would be this much, or else I would have never done it. Blah, blah, blah, blah, you point at the price list that is on the front desk for all to see and remind them that our prices are listed online. Their negligence to check that they could afford it is not your problem. And I tell you what, most people find that. That they can't afford the services because they can't afford bail. Okay?

Uh, you know, I am obviously not used to salon culture outside of anything other than beauty school, but isn't some money better than no money? Um, why would we not try to accommodate them based on what they can afford? Poor listening skills needs to be added to the list of things that you need to work on. Good to know. Anyway, as I was saying, it takes up too much time when you get to the beauty budget part of a consultation and someone says, Lo and behold, I can't afford that. They still want it though, right? And then you find yourself haggling with the client because they want more for less and you're trying to accommodate them for what? For less money and the same amount of work. No consultations are a lot more modern than they used to be and people are much more likely to ask how much it's going to cost beforehand. So what if someone brings it up? There's always a thorn in my side when people do ask. Obviously act accordingly then. But if someone doesn't do their due diligence of asking, then you get to do whatever you need to do, however many services you need to do to fulfill their expectation for that inspiration photo and at the end you charge accordingly. What if they can't afford it? They can afford it.
