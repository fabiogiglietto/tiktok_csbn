My mom would go through my backpack every single day when I got home from school, checking my homework like I was in third grade. She'd read my text messages whenever she felt like it, and if I complained, she'd take my phone away for a week. My dad wasn't much better. He had this rule where I couldn't leave the house after six PM, even on weekends. If I wanted to hang out with friends, I had to give them a full essay about where I was going, who would be there, and when I'd be back. The final straw was when they installed one of those tracking apps on my phone without telling me. I only found out because my friend Jake mentioned seeing my location pop up when he was trying to text me. I confronted them about it that night, and my mom just shrugged and said it was for my safety. My dad backed her up, saying as long as I lived under their roof, I followed their rules. Been working at this pizza place since I turned 16, saving up every paycheck except for what I needed for gas and lunch money. By the time I graduated high school, I had almost $4,000 saved up. I started looking at apartments online during my lunch breaks, telling myself I was just browsing. But the More I thought about it, the more I realized I could actually do this. Found this tiny studio apartment about 20 minutes from my job. The rent was only 600 a month, and the landlord said if I could prove I had a steady income and pay first month plus deposit, he'd rent to me. I went to look at it on a day my parents thought I was at work. It was small and kind of dingy, but it was mine. I filled out the application that same day. Two weeks later, he called and said I was approved. I could move in the following weekend. That's when it hit me that I was actually doing this. I felt sick to my stomach, but also kind of excited. I started slowly moving my stuff out. Every day after work, I'd grab a backpack full of clothes or books and stash them in my car. I told my parents I was staying late to help close the restaurant, which wasn't totally a lie, since I was picking up extra shifts to make sure I could afford everything. The hardest part was getting my bigger stuff out. I waited until they went to my aunt's house for Sunday dinner, something I'd gotten out of by saying I had to work. I loaded up my car with my dresser, my desk, and my T V. Left most of the furniture since it wasn't really mine anyway. But I took the stuff that Mattered. I left them a note on the kitchen counter. I kept it simple. Told them I'd moved out, that I was safe, and that I'd call them in a few days when I was settled. I said I needed space to figure out who I was as an adult and that I hoped they'd understand eventually. I left my house key next to the note. My phone started blowing up around 8 that night. Missed calls, texts, voicemails. My mom was crying, and half of them, my dad was yelling in the others. They wanted to know where I was, if I was okay, why I didn't talk to them first. They said they'd always supported me and couldn't understand why I do this to them. I turned my phone off and didn't turn it back on until the next morning. I had 37 missed calls and way too many texts to read through. I called them back and told them I was fine. Gave them my address and said they could come see my place if they wanted. My mom showed up.

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he'd just say, what's next, Sir, one Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Because she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd

And it doesn't matter. Like, bro, real friends don't need to be in the same classroom or even the same postcode to stay tight. You could be across the city in a different uniform learning completely different subjects, but somehow the bond never fades. Everyone else is like, oh, if you don't go to the same school, you'll drift apart. Nah, bro, not us. I could be sitting in math class stressed out over equations I'll never use in life, and you're across town doing science experiments and we're still texting dumb memes like we saw each other five minutes ago. And when we do link up on the weekend, it's like we never left. No awkward vibes, no weird energy, just straight vibes, bro. We might not be in the same school, but we've got the same mindset, same humour, same jokes, same energy. And the best part, when you meet their school friends and suddenly you feel famous, like, oh, you're that friend they always talk about, yeah, that's me. I don't even go here, but I run this friendship. So if you've got a friend that's in another school but still feels closer than anyone in your class, appreciate that. That's real friendship. Forget proximity. It's about loyalty.

The Coast Guard had been hunting narcotic runners in Miami waters all summer. And with my dark skin and old fishing boat, I looked like every dealer they profiled. I looked so suspicious that Marina security trailed me to my slip every time. Harbour patrol always circled twice when they saw me with my kids. So when the Coast Guard's cutter aimed straight at us, I knew we were targets. Screamed over the loud speaker while still 50 yards out. Cut engines now! My eight year old started crying. The Coast Guard jumped aboard before my daughter's tears dried. He circled me like a shark while three guardsmen kept hands on weapons. His eyes locked onto my Navy anchor tattoo. The Coast Guard made me lift my shirt and traced his finger over my combat scars from Syria. Then he turned to my kids huddled in the corner. My daughter buried her face in her brother's shoulder. The Coast Guard pointed at them and laughed. Teaching them the family business early, huh? He grabbed my arm and twisted it behind my back. The other Guardsmen just watched. My son reached for me, but I shook my head. The moment I shook my head at my son, The Coast Guard grabbed my shoulder. He put me down to my knees hard. The Coast Guard stood over me and started his lecture. He told my kids their daddy, Was a nobody, a narcotic dealer, a waste of space. When I quietly mentioned serving in naval intelligence, he bent down close. Bullshit. Maybe a dishwasher on base. He tore my shirt while pretending to search for track marks. The Coast Guard examined my scars and shook his head. My daughter heard every word. My son's fists clenched, but he stayed frozen. My children watched him tear apart their father, piece by piece. The Coast Guard pulled out his cuffs and made a show of it. He clicked them on tight while my kids stared. My eight year old reached for me, but Coast Guard stepped between us. He blocked her with his body and she stumbled backward. Her little hands shook. The Coast Guard looked at both my children and then back at me. He shook his head slowly like he was disappointed. Then he spit on the deck right next to where I knelt. What kind of father brings kids on narcotic runs? My son pulled his sister close. Then he spotted the decorated urn wedged between in our fishing poles. The brass caught the sunlight. I tried explaining through tears. My father. Vietnam Purple Heart. Today's memorial. The Coast Guard just laughed and pop the lid. He held it over the water. I lurched forward, but the stop me. He tilted it slowly at first, then dumped everything. The ashes hit the waves and spread out like a gray cloud. My daughter broke free and ran to The rail! Grandpa! She reached toward the water. The Coast Guard stepped back and smiled. The Coast Guard stepped back and smiled while my daughter cried for her grandpa. I lost it. Tried to stand, but he tackled me into the railing. My ribs cracked against the metal. He grabbed my neck and forced my head over the side into the same water where my father's ashes floated. He held me under. I fought, but the cuffs made it impossible. Gonna join your narcotic dealer, daddy? Down there? My children screamed. He yanked me up, gasping. Water poured from my mouth, then down again. Kids are better off without you. My eight year old begged him to stop. The other guardsmen look sick, but stayed frozen. My body went limp just as a Navy patrol boat roared up. The captain stood with binoculars locked on us. He grabbed his radio and his voice boomed across the water. That's Commander Williams, Naval Intelligence.

I'm sitting at my reserved table at this fancy Italian place when a couple walks up and says, excuse me, you're at our table. I politely tell them I have a seven PM reservation under my name. The woman rolls her eyes and says, as well, we have one too and we were here first. I show them my confirmation email. The guy gets aggressive. Look, we eat here every week. The hostess knows us. You need to move, the woman adds. We tip really well here. They know to take care of us. I refuse and say I'm not moving for my confirmed reservation. The guy starts raising his voice. This is ridiculous. We're regulars. Other diners start looking over. The woman notices and it's louder. Can you believe this? Some people have no courtesy. I flag down our waitress, hoping she'll check the reservation system. She walks over looking nervous. The couple immediately pounces, thank god you're here. This person took our usual table. The waitress looks between us awkwardly, oh, there might have been a mix up. Maybe you could sit at the bar. The couple smurfs like they've won. The woman crosses her arms. See, even she knows this is our table. The guy adds, we've been coming here for three years, same table every Friday. I'm getting heated, but stay calm and ask the waitress to check her system. He hesitates and says, well, they Are very good customers, the woman jumps in. Exactly. We spend serious money here, not like some random walk in. I tell her I'm not a walk in and show my confirmation. Again, the guy dismisses it. Anyone can fake an email these days. The woman suggests, why don't you just go somewhere else? There are plenty of other restaurants. Other customers are now openly staring at the scene. One couple at the next table starts whispering. The waitress looks uncomfortable and suggests again, the bar has really nice seating, same menu. The guy nods approving. Perfect solution. Everyone's happy. I refuse to budge and ask to speak to the manager. The woman laughs. Oh, please. He knows us personally. The guy adds. We had dinner with him last month. Good luck with that. The waitress says the manager is busy in the kitchen. The couple exchanges knowing looks. The woman leans in. Look, we can make this easy. Easy or hard, your choice. I ask what that means. The guy explains, we know the owner. One word from us and you'll never get a table here again. I stand my ground and say I'm keeping my legally reserved table. The couple gets more aggressive. The woman starts talking to nearby tables. Can you believe some people? No respect for loyalty? The guy joins. In three years we've been coming here, this is what customer service has become. A man at another table nods sympathetic. The woman turns back to Me, last chance, move or we'll make sure everyone knows how selfish you are. That's when I pull out my phone and call the restaurant right there in front of everyone. Hi, this is Johnny. I made a reservation for seven PM under Johnson. There's some confusion about my table. The couple's confidence wavers slightly. The guy I whispers, what is he doing? The hostess who seated the couple answers. I put it on speaker so everyone can hear. Oh, Mister Johnson, yes, table 12 is definitely yours. Wait, someone else.

I was devastated, but tried to understand. The next morning, he came over with his parents. Instead of support, they handed me a folder containing receipts for all the wedding expenses they'd contributed. His mother coldly said, since you're canceling, we expect reimbursement. I was speechless. My fiance couldn't even look me in the eye when he said, I'm sorry, but I didn't sign up for this. I wanted a wife, not a patient. He took his ring back and left. I was completely broken. My parents were furious, but focused on helping me through treatment. My sister postponed her semester abroad to be my caregiver. My friends organised a schedule to drive me to appointments. My workplace gave me flexible hours. Three months into my treatment, I received a text from my ex.

Because, like, I feel so unimportant in other people's lives. I don't feel loved, liked, or even wanted around. Everyone I know can go days without talking to me or even noticing I'm gone. I feel like I'm easily replaceable, and there's nothing I can do about that. I'll never be anyone's first choice, let alone second or third. In fact, does everyone see me as a burden? Nothing but an annoyance to talk to? And no, I won't tell anyone privately about this. Because what if someone starts talking to me out of pity? Because they feel obligated to? In fact, just telling you all this makes me feel like I'm begging for attention. I just want to feel appreciated. Like my presence is enjoyed by someone. Like someone will notice when I'm gone. Someone will reach out to me when I seem quieter than usual. Someone will care about me even when I feel unlovable. Just someone. Please. Anyways, bye. This is trend hopper 1:01 signing out.

For as long as I could remember, my younger brother Garrett had been insecure about being weak and scrawny. The LaCrosse team would shove him into lockers daily, calling him Twig Boy. The worst was when he couldn't open a water bottle at lunch and his crush Emily laughed, asking the guy next to her, Garrett's too weak. He needs a man to help him. I always felt bad for him. But the day he discovered one punch man, everything changed. He burst into my room holding his phone showing me Saitama's transformation. Look, he was just like me, a weak, bullied nobody. Then he did the simple training and became the strongest hero alive. I was just happy he found something that gave him hope. The very next morning, Garrett started Saitama's routine religiously, 100 push UPS, 100 sit UPS, 100 squats and a 10 kilometer run every single day. Within two months, his arms showed actual definition and his chest filled out his shirts, the LaCrosse team stopped shoving him around completely. While mom bought him protein powder and dad installed a pull up bar. Look at my dedicated boy. She'd beam at dinner when he shaved his head bald, the school counselor pulled me aside. Whatever is motivating him, it's working. His grades are up, confidence through the roof. Even I was impressed when he bench pressed his body wait for the first time. The best part was Emily starting to notice watching him do pull UPS after school and asking about his anime workout. He flex and quote Sidema, I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun. We all laughed because he was finally becoming the person he wanted to be. But as months passed, things shifted when Garrett demanded everyone call him Sidema. Refusing to Garrett anymore. Teachers got email signed Sidema while he begged mom to legally change his name. When you're 18, she said, this is just a phase. Soon after, he quit soccer because Sidema trained alone and his knuckles stayed permanently stabbed from painting concrete walls in our basement. I'm removing my limiters, he explained, wrapping them in bloody gauze. Now deadlifting 300 pounds, his frame had exploded from 130 to 200 pounds of pure muscle with veins sneaking up his arms like cables. When I tried talking to him about my concerns, he brushed me off. You're getting too intense about this. The whole point is to push past human limits. He showed me his training journal filled with detailed power rankings, strength measurements and notes about breaking through with page after page of Sidema quotes highlighted in yellow. After he passed out doing squats, mom attempted an intervention. Honey, you need rest days. Tama never rested. That's why he transcended. He stormed out to run his 10 kilometer run at midnight. Then the mall incident started a week later when he began picking fights, asking random guys to test His power level until security banned him after the third confrontation. His fist now bore a tattoo reading one punch in bold letters across the knuckles. Six months into his transformation, Garrett looked like a bodybuilder who'd swallowed another bodybuilder. At 220 pounds of carved muscle with shoulders so wide he turned sideways through doorways. We were driving to get groceries on a normal Tuesday morning when he saw a cop conducting a routine traffic stop on the shoulder. Pull over, he said with deadly calm in his voice. What? No, we need to pull over. He grabbed the wheel. This is it, my moment. I pulled over. With shaking hands as he got out and walked toward the officer with purpose. The cop immediately tensed with his hand moving to his whole.

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother, so one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling washed over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he Was one afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, he said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

It happened during an argument about her curfew. Carmen would let me stay out until midnight, she screamed. She actually understands me. I wish she was my real mom instead of you. I stood there in our kitchen holding the car keys she wanted, feeling something inside me shatter. Carmen, my ex husband's 26 year old wife, yoga instructor who bought my daughter designer clothes and let her drink wine at dinner. The cool mom who didn't enforce bedtimes or check homework. Your curfew is still ten PM, I said quietly slipping the keys into my pocket. I hate you, Natalie shouted. You're ruining my life, dad and Carmen treat me like an adult. She ran to her room and slammed the door. I heard her immediately on the phone. Mom's being a total bitch again. Can you come get me? 40 minutes later, my ex pulled up in his BMW, didn't even come to the door. Natalie dragged her overnight bag downstairs refusing to look at me. I'm staying at dad's this week, maybe permanently. Natalie, you have school. Carmen will drive me. She doesn't have a real job anyway. The job was intentional. I work 50 hours a week as a nurse to keep our apartment, pay for her braces, her phone, her life. Carmen teaches yoga three times a week and post motivational quotes on Instagram. After they left, I sat on Natalie's bed, looked Around her room, the walls still had the stars we painted together when she was 7. The bookshelf I built with my own hands, the quilt my mother made before she passed. But her Instagram was full of photos from her dad's house, Carmen's pristine kitchen, the pool, the shopping sprees, captions like with my favourite person, heart, eyes under, selfies with Carmen. Not one photo of us. I was the one up all night when she had pneumonia at 3. I taught her how to ride a bike, how to read, how to be kind. I worked doubles to pay for her dance classes while her father found himself in Thailand for six months. But Carmen was fun. Carmen was young. Carmen didn't make her eat vegetables or go to bed or study. Natalie stayed at her dad's for 2 weeks, posted constantly about her amazing bonus mom and their girls nights. Carmen taught her how to contour, bought her outfits. I'd said we're too grown up. Let her boyfriend sleep over. Then Carmen got bored. I got the call at 2:00am, Natalie crying, mom, can you come get me? What's wrong? Dad and Carmen went to Vegas. They left me here alone. I, I think someone's trying to break in. I drove 20 minutes in my pajamas, a baseball bat on the passenger seat, found her hiding in the bathroom shaking. The break in turned out to be tree branches scratching the window. But she'd been alone for Two days. I said I was mature enough to handle it, she whispered in the car. Carmen said it was good practice for college. You're 15. I know. Back home, I made her hot chocolate, real cocoa, not the sugar free kind Carmen buys. Natalie sat at.

Marry him anyway, my grandmother told me when I showed her the prenup my fiance's lawyer had drawn up. But first become exactly what they think you are. Everyone else said to run. My friends were horrified. My sister called me pathetic. The prenup basically said if we divorced, I'd get nothing. No alimony, no assets, no claim to anything acquired during marriage. Brian came from old money. His family was convinced I was a gold digger, a nurse marrying a tech CEO for his bank account. The prenup was their idea, protecting their precious son from the calculating poor girl. Sign it, grandma said, then go back to school. With what money? His. She was right. The prenup said nothing about education expenses during marriage, thing about him paying for my life while married. It only protected assets and divorce. So I signed it. His family celebrated. His mother actually said, so glad you understand your place. The day after our wedding, I enrolled in law school. Ryan thought it was cute. My little wife wants to be a lawyer. His friends laughed about how I'd never finish. I finished top of my class, law review, passed the bar, first try. His mother sneered at graduation. Such a waste. You'll be having babies soon. Anyway, I started my MBA next. Ryan paid for everything. We were married, shared finances. The prenup couldn't touch that. His family rolled their eyes at family Dinners while I discussed international business law. Seven years in, I had a law degree, an MBA and had started a consulting firm with the money Ryan gave me for shopping. Built it from nothing to six figures while being the perfect trophy wife at his events. His family still treated me like trash, still made jokes about the prenup protecting them from me. Ryan started believing them, getting cocky, cheating because what was I going to do, leave with nothing? Year 10, I filed for divorce. Ryan laughed. You get nothing. Remember that prenup you signed? Actually, I said I get everything I built. While the prenup protected his pre marriage assets and his income, it said nothing about businesses started during marriage with marital funds. My law degree taught me that. My MBA helped me build it. My consulting firm was worth $2 million. Started with his money? Yes, but legally mine. That's fraud, his mother screamed at mediation. That's marriage. My lawyer, my study partner from law school replied she used marital assets to build her own career. Completely legal. They tried to fight it at $300,000 on lawyers trying to break my business claim. But I documented everything perfectly, every dollar traced, every paper filed correctly. My grandmother's advice that everyone thought was stupid, become exactly what they think you are, then become something they never imagined. I thought I was a gold digger. Fine. I dug through their legal gold mine and found my own treasure. The best part was during the divorce proceedings, Ryan's lawyer tried to argue, I'd planned this all along.

My brother Ryan was marrying this absolute nightmare of a woman named Brianna. Nobody in our family could stand her, but Ryan was completely blind to it. She was controlling from day one. She told my mom she couldn't wear navy to the wedding because that was her color. She demanded our family pay for all the flowers, which cost, like $3,000. When I asked if I could bring my two kids to the wedding, she said absolutely not, because children would ruin her perfect day. But the worst part was when we found out she hadn't even sent an invitation to our grandma Helen. When my mom asked why, Brianna just shrugged and said grandma was boring and would probably fall asleep during the ceremony anyway. I was furious. Grandma Helen was 82 and had basically raised Ryan after our dad died. She taught him how to drive, helped him with homework every night, and even paid for his college textbooks when money was tight. When grandma found out she wasn't invited, she didn't yell or cry like I expected. She just sat quietly in her kitchen chair, nodding slowly. Then she looked up at me with this calm smile and said, well, we'll see about that, won't we? The wedding day came, and I was dreading every minute of it. The venue was actually this gorgeous old mansion that had been in our family for Decades. Grandma had let Ryan use it for free because she wanted his wedding to be special.

There was Grandma Helen walking up the main entrance in the most stunning gold gown I'd ever seen. She looks like royalty. She was carrying this leather folder under her arm and had the biggest smile on her face. Brianna spotted her immediately and marched over, her face turning bright red. What are you doing here?

The 9 1 1 operator probably recognized her voice better than her own family did. Things got worse as spring turned into summer and her calls went from annoying to actually dangerous. First, she called CPS and said we left our kids alone outside. I was sitting right there on the porch with a book when the social worker showed up. They close the case right away, but people had already started talking about us. Two weeks later, during my daughter's birthday party, she called the fire department about a gas leak. Five fire trucks showed up with their sirens going and scared all 12 kids at the party. The firefighters didn't find anything, but she went on Facebook saying we were probably making drugs. The worst thing happened in July when my autistic son had a meltdown in our yard. She called 9 1 1 and said a child was being beaten. Showed up ready for a domestic violence call and found me hugging my upset kid. Officer Martinez said something about her false reports, but Nothing happened to her. She started calling during my work zoom meetings on purpose. Other neighbors told me she kept notebooks full of made up complaints with dates and everything. She actually brag to people about making families like ours want to move away. Everything went crazy on a Tuesday in August when I got a letter from her lawyer wanting $15,000. She said we cause her emotional distress even though she was the one who called 9 1 1 53 times. I tried to talk to her like a normal person, but she said she'd add harassment to the lawsuit. That same day, my autistic son had his first friend from therapy come over to play. While the two kids were quietly playing with Legos, she called about suspicious people in my yard. Police cars surrounded my house, and both seven year olds were terrified.

Like something in my brain goes, wow, yes, it's a good idea to rearrange my room right now. But I swear I hit all the phases. I'll be happy watching TikTok chilling. Then boom, it hits 2:00am and a wave of sadness comes. I'll start crying, acting all depressed and watching videos that aren't even sad. Then start reposting some of them. Like I'll come across a video of a father and daughter and be like, huh, that could be me and my dad if he didn't leave. Then I'll come across one of those top 10 funniest moments on the Kevin Lang Show and I'm there cracking up, trying to hold in my laugh so I don't wake anyone up. Then suddenly I come across one of those gym motivation videos yelling at me through the screen, you want to be known as lazy your whole life and I'll be taking it serious, thinking, hell no. Then they say drop down and do 10 push UPS. So I do, but my noodle arms are so weak, I can't even do one. So the walk of shame, climbing back in my bed. But no, the adrenaline is still there. I set an alarm at 6:00am to go for a run. So then I decide to go sleep. Suddenly, I'm hit with the most embarrassing memories flooding my head. Every move shifts to a Different one. My brain is practically telling me, ha, remember this, you fucking loser. Eventually I fall asleep, then wake up from the fuck ass alarm I set and be like, who the heck did I think I was? And go back to sleep. So moral of the story, just go to bed early before the 5 stages of grief hit you. More stories coming soon.

After 12 hours of labor, the nurse handed me my son for the first time, and my brain completely rejected what my eyes were showing me. Sarah was destroyed from 12 hours of labor, her blonde hair plastered with sweat as she reached for our baby with shaking arms. But I stood paralyzed. The child in my white hands had deep brown skin and tightly coiled black hair that looked like someone had played the cruelest possible prank on us. Isn't he beautiful, Sarah whispered. And I forced myself to nod, even though my throat felt like it was closing. She must have seen something in my face because her smile faltered and she said, I know he doesn't look like what we expected, but remember what I told you about my great, great grandfather? I did remember vaguely some story about distant relatives with darker features, but this baby looked completely black. And my mind was racing with possibilities I didn't want to consider. The next few hours were a blur of nurses checking vitals and Sarah's family bursting through the door. They raced here for the emergency delivery while my family searched desperately for flights from Colorado. Her mother cradled our son like precious gold, and her sister kept touching his tiny fingers and saying he had Sarah's exact chin. Their pure joy made my doubts feel poisonous. Sarah watched me watching them and finally reached for my hand. Are you okay with this, she whispered. And her voice broke something open in me. I kissed her forehead and promised I'd be the best father this baby could have. This wasn't what we'd expected, but we were still a team. Nothing would change that. But the poison started seeping in. The moment I left the hospital to grab clothes from home, my phone exploded with messages from my mother, who'd seen the photos Sarah posted. That is not your child, her text said in all caps, followed by, I told you she wasn't good enough for our family. My best friend Jake called while I was driving and said, dude, I'm sorry, but there's no way. You need to get tested ASAP before you sign anything. Even my brother, who'd always loved Sarah, texted, man, the math isn't mathing here. By the time I got back to the hospital, my head was spinning with doubt. Sarah was nursing the baby and singing softly, looking like the perfect mother. But all I could think about was how she'd been working late so many nights during her pregnancy and how her phone was always face down on the counter. My mother called again while Sarah was sleeping and spent 20 minutes listing every time she'd caught Sarah in a lie, which were really just miscommunications, but suddenly seemed sinister. She played you for a fool, my mother said, and now she's trying to pass off another man's baby as yours. The Next morning, I couldn't even look at the baby without feeling sick. Sarah noticed immediately and asked what was wrong. But I just shrugged and said I was tired. She tried again, reminding me about her cousin Marcus, who had similar features, even pulling up photos on her phone. But my mother's voice kept echoing in my head, especially after her text that morning saying there were no flights left and she'd come when things were sorted out. When the discharge papers came, I told Sarah I needed air and walked out of the hospital. I sat in my car for an hour reading text after text from friends and family, all saying the same thing, that I was being scammed, that no genealogy could explain this, that I needed to protect myself. I didn't go back inside. Instead, I texted Sarah that I needed a paternity test before we were done, then turned off my phone and drove to my buddy's house to crash on his couch. My brother caught the first flight out when I finally called him, and we spent days feeding each other's doubts while I ignored Sarah's desperate attempts to reach me. She's probably scrambling to figure out her story, my brother said when we grabbed beers at some dive bar near. Thank god you didn't sign the birth certificate, my mother added during one of her hourly calls, her voice full of relief, like I dodged a bullet instead of abandoned my family when I finally agreed to meet for the test. I made.

I lost my son to the streets when he was 14. That was it. Deshawn started running with the nigeltron, stealing, carrying guns, disappearing for weeks at a time. His dad was in prison, so it was just me working double shifts at the hospital while watching my baby throw his life away piece by piece. But I fought like hell to get him back. I never stopped praying he'd come home alive. That year, everything changed completely. Deshawn got arrested on a weapons charge, facing ten years as an adult. But the feds made him an offer. Cooperate with their investigation, testify against his crew, and he'd get probation plus witness Protection. They promised me he'd be safe. We've done this hundreds of times, Mrs. Serena. Your son will be completely protected. This is his ticket out of this life forever. Deshawn took the deal without hesitation. When he was freed eight months later, something was different in his eyes. He looked at me and said, Mama, I'm done with this life. I wanna make you proud for once. The prosecutors relocated us across town. New apartment, new phone numbers, new identities. They said the gang thought he was still locked up. We were completely invisible. I went overboard helping him rebuild his entire future. Got him enrolled in GED classes, drove him to community college. Every morning at 7:00am sharp, he studied like his life depended on it. Which It literally did. Applied to Howard University for business administration. Talked constantly about opening an auto shop, helping kids like himself escape the streets. When the Howard acceptance letter came in March, full scholarship, he screamed so loud, the neighbors complained. First person in our family to go to university. He was blowing with pure joy and pride. His community college graduation was May 20th. Then Howard in the fall. I took my first vacation day in three years. Bought a new dress from the department store, got my hair done professionally. I wanted to look perfect when they called his name. Sean had his speech memorized. Practiced it every morning in the bathroom mirror. The night before graduation, Desean was trying on his cap and gown for the hundredth time, practicing his walk across an imaginary stage. I was making his favorite dinner, my grandmother's fried chicken recipe. We stayed up late talking about Howard. He hugged me tight and said, and tomorrow is our day, Mama. We made it. That morning, Deshawn woke me up at 6:00am, grinning ear to ear. Graduation day, he yelled. We had breakfast together. He put on his suit, and I took pictures of him in his cap and gown. He left early to get to the venue and practice his speech one more time. I was driving to the ceremony alone, singing along to the radio, when my phone rang. It was the hospital Miss

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning, after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day, I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy, and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was. One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night. Just stood in the doorway, clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development. Their church pastor who believed homosexuality was a choice. And for three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires. Just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We Were constantly monitored. No privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One. One night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

I didn't know guys will just stand in the shower for 10 minutes doing nothing, no water running, just standing there like they're waiting for a download to finish. The first time I walked in on it, I thought something was wrong. He looked at me all calm and said, I'm just mentally preparing. I've never looked at showers the same way. 2. I found out men treat fridges like treasure hunts. He'll open it five times in a row, stare like something new is going to spawn, sigh dramatically, and then eat plain cheese straight from the block. I once asked why he keeps checking. He said in case a snack magically appears. Three, I didn't know guys hum to themselves during the most random tasks. My boyfriend will be cleaning the sink humming what sounds like boss battle music, then suddenly switched to singing about how this sponge is my sword. I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said, but it still smells like me so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said, because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6, 10. They make sound effects for everything, opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7, they'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8, they'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes.

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother, so one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his work bench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice. And I apologized over and over. I, I promised I would talk to him, but deep down, I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, I said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

I understand that you've been married for three years, but I'm hurting also because I had no idea that he was married to you, and he's been acting like we are creating. Okay, but you know what I'm saying. Three months of casual dating is nothing compared to an actual marriage. No, no, no. Okay, I wasn't. Oh, my goodness. Wait, listen. I wasn't. Okay, does he take off his wedding ring every time you see him? Yeah, he. Girl, he has never been wearing a wedding ring ever. Like, never ever. And I wasn't trying to be disrespectful. Oh, my. Of your marriage. I had no idea that he was married. Like, so. That's what I'm saying. So obviously, it's not been casual dating. In my opinion, and in my eyes, we have been building something together. So forgive me for sleeping with your husband, but I had no idea that he was your husband. Do you feel me? Oh, man. Um. Okay, well, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to forgive you, but obviously, like you said, I guess she didn't tell you. This is not necessarily your fault. I'm sure. I hope That you wouldn't go out of your way to sleep with a married man. But if you said that you don't know that he's married, I guess I don't really have any choice to believe you, so. Oh, my god. What? I'm going to. I mean, I honestly wouldn't. I wouldn't go out of my way to sleep with a married man. But, like, here's the. The fact of the matter is that I did, you know, and I do have feelings for Desmond. So I don't really know. Like, I don't really know what to say right now. I'm feeling very overwhelmed, and I'm sorry. I don't. This is really totally, completely awkward and weird, but, like, I don't know what's going on, either. I have no idea. I'm. I just. I'm. I'm so. I'm shocked. I am. I'm so angry. I don't know what to do. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna. I can't. I can't believe this.

Her name is Kelly. Okay. Okay. Kelly's a hot girl name. Mm hmm. Yeah, that's. That's what I always think, anyway. And so she works out, like, all the time. She's, like, really in shape and all that stuff. Okay. Is that something you talked to her about, or you just assume we. Because we. We talked a little bit about that. You know, she never eats sugar, never eats bread, and, um, she's always strict about her diet. I get that. I mean, I'm not quite as good. To look amazing, those are the things that you have to sacrifice. That's why I've never been willing to do it. Take all the fun out of your life. Yeah. So we hung out, went out to dinner, and I even got the, you know, the cauliflower appetizer. We had sushi. You were trying to lead into her lifestyle, so less carbs today. Yeah. Yeah, I was all in on it, you know? And then we went over to. We went bowling over at Cosmic Balls, you know, and they got the neon lights and the loud music, you know, we were having, like, a good time. Balls are. That is a good. And that's where you can, like, order some mozzarella sticks for yourself on the side and eat them over, like, the bathroom where she can't see you. Tell him, hey, leave them over on the stall. Too on the stall. But the thing is, the bowling, it ends like at 11:00. And I was like, I thought the date went well. And I was thinking, we just call it a night, okay. But out of nowhere, she was like, hey, like, what are we gonna do now? Oh, I love it. Like she wants to keep going. Yeah. I'm thinking, wait a minute, that's a fastball. Belt buckle. So I just said, fastball, belt buckle. Is she a little bit in the eyes and knock it out of the park, guys. Oh, I thought he said belt. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, belt. That's like the perfect place to hit a ball. It's a sweet spot. Alright, it's a layup. Are you a little bit older than Kelly? No. Well, I think I have a couple years on her, but not that much. Okay, but girls say like, what are we doing now? After a date? Yeah, after we're having a good time. You like dinner and a date? Well, I just said, well, you know, you want to come over? Yeah, yeah, okay. But you know, she needed to get coffee first. So we just went to one of those gas stations and got some coffee and. Oh, gas station coffee. You couldn't wait to Starbucks? That's open 24 hours. She suffered from heartburn the rest of the evening. It's not easy to get a coffee. I guess at 11:30 it is. If you know the Prices, yeah. Yeah, but not all, like, Starbucks or whatever. I mean, maybe that's not even a thing. Like, was it. Was she fine with that? It's not like we're in Miami in the 80s. You just got to figure out a place to get told. You are definitely older than Kelly. I'm not. I read this right

I'm like furious. You know, maybe you should tell your female co host again, whoever she is. Oh my God. She needs to learn a lesson and know her place. Okay. Every other woman does. Yeah, I'll do that for you. I'll do that. I'm gonna. Hey, Brooke, men are talking. Hi, this is Scott. Hey, Scott, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Scott, you there? Uh, I don't know who this is. Oh, you don't? That's what I just said. What? What is this? My my name is Jubal. I'm calling from brick and Jubal in the morning, the radio show. And I'm calling you because you recently went out on a date with one of our listeners and they were hoping that we could get a hold of you. Why is a radio show calling me about a date? Well, we do a segment on our show called The 2nd Date Update. So you recently went out on a date with a girl named Jenna. Yeah. Okay. And so Jenna emailed us because you haven't been answering any of her phone calls and she thought you guys had a great time, but she's wondering if she did something wrong or if there was a specific reason that you're not calling her back. No, there's nothing specific. Just, you know, not digging to going through with things that you know There's no point to so you feel like there's no point in continuing to try to date Jenna? I mean, I just know that it's not gonna work let me ask you this was it because she dressed too conservatively right? Please. I know that's annoying. No, that had nothing to do with it. Okay. Well, she was she was actually concerned that that might be the issue. No, that's that's that's not the reason why well, if that's not the reason why can you kind of give us a little bit of information so that at least I can tell her hey, don't worry about the way that you dress it wasn't that yeah, you can tell her that that's fine but I mean, as far as like a more specific thing it's just kind of like one of those things where it's not gonna work and really to be honest, she's cute and everything but I'm looking for a different breed of girl a different breed. What does that even mean? We're not breed like we don't come like thoroughbred or no, there are some thoroughbreds out there and there are some definite runs believe me. I know I know what you're talking about Scott. Yeah, I mean, there are some breeds of all kinds of humans. Thank you. But what are you looking for then? You know, basically I'm a guy who works a lot pretty successful at what I do and you know is she not Pretty enough? No, she's fine. She's very cute. I'm not saying that the bottom line is that like, I don't know how to say this, but she's too smart. What you said too? Did you just say too smart? Yeah, too smart. Yeah, that's right. She is too smart. I'm not looking for, um, a smart girl. What you want for, um, a smart girl what you want that might be the, that might be the best way to be turned down for a date ever is for somebody to tell you that you're too smart. That's like a compliment, but then also a let down at the same time. Why? What? What do you mean you, you only date dumb girls? Well, I mean, I wouldn't say that. Um, I just want someone who is not as smart and someone who's not as ambitious as Jenna is. Why would you not? I, I, I feel like I look for the opposite and I've never had the opposite. So I've had the other thing and trust me, it's not all that's cracked up to be, but I feel like I want the opposite and and why would you want to be with someone who's not ambitious and not smart? Well, like I said, I'm pretty successful and, um, I need someone who's just gonna focus on me and not their own career or their own motivation. Oh my God. Oh, so cool. So you just want someone to be home And look pretty for you and make you some dinner every once in a while. You know, I'm a good looking guy. I do really well. Basically, I just been looking for some arm candy. And there's nothing wrong with that. Well, there is because you're treating your woman as a trophy no matter who she is. So there's lots of things wrong with that. There is a ton of benefits, okay. She gets to go on a lot of great vacation, a lot of business trip.

But my daughter did something that made him turn pale. It was Thanksgiving at his parents house and I should have known better than to show up with store bought dinner rolls. For eight years of marriage to Derek, I had Learned that everything had to be perfect in front of his family or there would be consequences later. But I had been pulling 12 hour shifts at the hospital all week and barely had time to shower, let alone bake homemade bread. His mother, Patricia, made the first comment. As I set the plastic container on her perfectly set dining table, she lifted one roll with her manicured fingers like it might contaminate her entire meal. Well, she said, loud enough for the entire room to hear, I suppose not everyone has time for family traditions anymore. Twenty two family members were crammed into that dining room. His parents, both brothers with their wives, six kids ranging from toddlers to teenagers, and various aunts and uncles who had been in from neighboring towns. All of them turned to stare at me like I had committed some unforgivable sin. I forced a smile and explained that I had been working overtime at the hospital. Three nurses had called in sick with the flu and someone had to cover the emergency department. I thought they would understand. His father was a retired police officer. His brothers worked construction. They knew about demanding jobs. But Derek's face was already turning that familiar shade of red that meant trouble was coming. His jaw clenched the way it always did when he thought I had embarrassed him. The vein in his temple started throbbing. You always have an excuse, he said loudly enough to cut through every conversation in the room. The football game on TV suddenly seemed too loud. Someone's fork clinked against their plate. One of the toddlers asked for more juice, but nobody moved to help him. All eyes were on us. Now. I'm not making excuses, I said as calmly as I could manage. I'm explaining why I didn't have time to bake this week. That's when he hit me. The slap echoed through the dining room like a gunshot. My cheek exploded in pain, and I could taste blood where my teeth had cut the inside of my lip. The force of it knocked me sideways, and I had to grab the back of a chair to keep from falling. Complete silence fell over the room. Not one person moved. Not one person spoke. His father stared at his plate like it held the secrets of the universe. His mother suddenly developed an intense interest in folding and refolding her napkin. His brothers exchanged a quick glance, but immediately looked away. Even the children had gone completely quiet. Don't you ever embarrass me like that again! Derek hissed through clenched teeth. That's When my 16 year old daughter Chloe stood up from the kids table in the corner. She had been living with us for two years since her father died in a motorcycle accident. Derek had never liked her, always complained that she was too mouthy, too independent, too much like me for his taste. She walked over slowly, deliberately pulling her phone out of her back pocket as she moved. When she reached where Derek was standing, she held it up and aimed it directly at his face. Smile, she said with the sweetest voice imaginable. You're about to become very famous. Derek's angry red face drained to white so fast I thought he might pass out. His hands, which had been clenched into fists, started shaking. What the hell are you talking about? He demanded. I've been recording everything for the last hour, Chloe announced to the entire room. Every nasty comment, every threat, every single slap. And guess what, Uncle Derek? It's already uploaded to three different cloud servers. She turned to face his entire family, who were now staring at her like she'd grown a second head. Did you all know that in this state, witnessing domestic violence and failing to report it when children

My first few months as a 9 1 1 operator were scary, but nothing could have prepared me for when I got a call late at night from a young girl. I could barely understand what she was saying through her sobbing, but she told me she had just swallowed an entire bottle of pills and just wanted someone to talk to before they did anything. I started asking her why she would do that and asked for her address. She thought I already had it. But after a few minutes, she finally told me where she lived. She said she was severely depressed and just wanted everything to end. I asked her why, just trying to keep her on the phone and she said she couldn't take the hate she was getting anymore. I knew I only had literal minutes to do something and tried talking her into throwing up. She told me no. So I asked her what kind of hate she was getting. Apparently, she just wanted people to like her and wanted to help people. She was getting a lot of hate comments on TikTok and even people in real life. Then it all clicked. I knew I recognized her voice and I actually knew who she was. After a few minutes, I asked her if she was who I thought and she was really surprised. I started to tell her how one of her Videos actually changed my life and got me out of a toxic relationship. She knew I wasn't lying because I told her all about it. I asked her one more time and she finally agreed to try and make herself throw up. She was unconscious when the paramedics got there, but because of that, she was still alive. She now has millions of followers and I'm glad to see her much happier today.

I thought Doctor Martinez had seen everything, 23 years of experience, wrote the textbook on emotional regulation, had a waiting list longer than a CVS receipt. His office wall was covered in certificates, including one from the Dalai Lama. I was there because I'd gotten into a fist fight with a mall Santa. Not my proudest moment. Anger, Doctor Martinez said during our first session, is like holding a hot coal. You're only burning yourself. He had this perfectly calibrated therapist voice like NPR merged with a yoga instructor. Behind him sat a collection of stress balls shaped like world leaders heads. I noticed Nixon was particularly worn out. Session one was textbook. We explored my triggers, discussed coping strategies. He gave me a worksheet about identifying emotions. I pretended to care. He pretended to believe me. We were both professionals at this dance. Session 3, I mentioned my coworker Brad. Brad replies all to every email, even the automated ones. Brad clips his toenails at his desk. Brad pronounces it expresso and corrects others who say it right. Doctor Martinez's left eye twitched just once. Brad sounds challenging, he said, squeezing Stalin's head. Session 5 changed everything. I was ranting about my gym. They play the same Ed Sheeran song on repeat for three months. The same song. Doctor Martinez set down his notepad. Which song? Thinking out loud, he went pale. My gym plays shape of You four months, I've counted 847 times. By session seven, we'd abandoned all pretenses. He for us both coffee and we just vent. His mother in law moved in and rearranged his entire house while he was at work. My HOA, find me for my grass being 0.5 inches too tall. He got a parking ticket. While contesting a different parking ticket, I found out my ex was dating my dentist. Session 9, he told me about his colleague, Doctor Peterson. He steals my yogurt every day, writes his name on my yogurt, says he's conducting a social experiment on possession and ownership. I have a pee HD from Harvard. I don't need his experiments. I need my strawberry yo plate. Session 11 was when the universe chose violence. I walked in to find him on the phone. White knuckle Churchill ceramic head. What do you mean the insurance doesn't cover therapy for therapists? I am the therapy. He hung up, looked at me. My therapist just fired me. Said I was too negative. M E. I teach positivity seminars. Then his phone buzzed, a text from his teenage daughter. Dad, I'm dropping out to be an influencer. Also, I crashed your car into a subway. The restaurant, not the train. Something in his eyes changed like watching a documentary about damn failures. First a crack, then a trickle, then you know what? He stood up eerily calm. Buddha was wrong. Nisha was wrong. Young Freud, all of them wrong. He picked up his stress ball collection. Some people just need to be punched. Some situations don't have a breathing exercise sometimes. He launched Nixon at his diploma. The only path to inner peace is accepting that everyone else is the problem. He opened his window, started throwing everything out. Books, certificates, the meditation fountain that never worked anyway. Twenty three years of breathe and count to 10. You know what? I've been counting to 10 my whole life. I'm at like 84 million by now. His secretary knocked. Doctor Martinez, your three o'clock is here. Tell them to breathe and count to 10, he screamed, launching Roosevelt out the window. Security.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight. Be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly, and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I turned onto our street, there was a black Infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walking up like he'd done it before. Becca opened. Before he could ring, they kissed. The kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too. I needed to do something else. Something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe. How was your night? Good. You know how it is. The next two Thursdays, I kept my routine, but park down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage, and that's when it hit me. Man was Mark. Mark, who supposedly moved to Seattle two years ago. My Knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped the bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for Boys Night, when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Yeah, Mark was great. You guys still text, though, right? Sometimes. The next morning, she woke up different, with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors. And since it was Thursday, during lunch she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew. The comment about Mark got her. Probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old after work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then picking it back up at 7:15. She practically pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time there was no car that showed up. And at nine fifteen, becca's own car pulled out. I followed her. First stop, o'malley's sports bar, where she thought i'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused, checking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress, who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone, probably my picture. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly Prime Sports Bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms, heard her say, every Thursday night, group of guys, probably five or six of them, loud. One of them looks like this. The bartender studied her phone. Thursday is our slowest night. I definitely remember a regular group. Sorry. She left looking frustrated, sat in her car for five minutes typing furiously. Then she drove to the AMC theater. I gave her a 10 minute head start, then walked in through the side entrance. He was at the concession stand talking to the teenage manager. Showed her phone again. He Pointed toward the theaters, she went to check each one, opening doors, scanning the sparse Thursday night crowds. I went back to my car. Twenty minutes later, she emerged, looking defeated. Sat in her car for another 10 minutes. Through her rear window, I could see her on the phone, gesturing with her free hand. Probably calling Mark. Probably saying she couldn't find me anywhere. Maybe. I knew that Thursday nights might not be safe anymore. She even drove by two more bars on the way home. Quick stops, desperate checks. When I got home at my usual time, she was on the couch with wine, trying to look casual, but her leg was bouncing. How was your night? Studying my face. Good. Same as always? Yeah. Where exactly did you guys go? Oh, Malley's. Why? Her jaw clenched. No reason. Just curious. Was it busy? Pretty dead, actually. Who all was there? Haven't heard their names in a while. The usual.

Instead of waiting for my husband and son to come home to celebrate with me, I received a video from my husband's first girlfriend. In the video, my husband and my son were with her and my son was hugging her, saying he wished she could be his mother. After seeing that, instead of calling him to confront him, I silently packed my suitcase and signed the divorce papers. It was unusual for my husband, Dominic, to come home at midnight and find the house completely dark. No matter what time it was, I always left a light on for him. That night, he handed our son Grayson over to the housekeeper and went straight to the master bedroom. I was sitting on the sofa with a carefully packed suitcase by my side and the I divorce agreement on the coffee table in front of me. Dominic frowned. Paisley, what is this? Another one of your dramatics? I didn't have the strength for his criticism. My voice came out calm and firm. I want a divorce. His face showed disbelief. Why? Because I forgot your birthday. It doesn't matter, I replied, pushing the divorce agreement toward him. Sign it. Let's end this. He flipped through the pages mockingly. You're leaving empty handed. Where will you go without me? A bitter laugh escaped my lips. He was so sure he had me trapped, thinking I had no one in here fell and nothing to hold on to. I push The papers even closer. Sign it. Don't waste time. For a moment he hesitated, then his voice hardened. Fine, divorce it is, but Sonny's custody is not negotiable. You won't get him. Suddenly, Grayson appeared, looking at me with tears streaming down his cheeks. I'm staying with dad. I don't wanna go with you. You're a horrible mother, a witch. That's enough, Grayson. Dominic snapped, but Grayson's rage didn't subside. If you hadn't gotten in the way of dad and Marisa, she'd be my mom now. I cut the tension with that same cold voice. I don't care, Grayson. I don't care about anything. I just want the divorce. That word left Dominic in silence. He clenched his jaw and his eyes darkened with frustration. Are you sure about this? I tossed the pen onto the table. Sign it. Let's end this. Dominic's frustration gave way to a flicker of doubt. Before he could sign, I grabbed my copy, took my suitcase and headed for the door. Tomorrow at 9:00am sharp at City Hall. Don't be late, I said without hesitation. Just as I was about to walk out, Dominic grabbed my wrist tightly. Let go, I said coldly, he sneered. In such a rush to leave, you already have a lover. I looked him straight in the eyes. If you don't want to wait for part 2, you can watch the full story on my YouTube channel.

My husband's on the way home. I lied immediately feeling nervous from his question. The delivery driver held my Chinese food peeking into my house. What does your husband look like? He asked. Sorry, listen, I have a movie to catch. Here's an extra tip. I pushed a 5 dollar Bill at him and reached for my food. What does he look like? He pressed more desperately. His tone making all the hair on the back of my neck stand up straight. I grabbed my food and practically slammed the door in his face before turning the dead bolt. Now, I know weird people deliver food all the time, but I wasn't ready to become a true crime story that people we'll make YouTube videos about. But 20 minutes later, just as I'd forgotten all about him, I walked into the kitchen to get some ice cream and noticed that his car was still parked on the street with the engine running. When his eyes met mine through the window, I closed the blinds in a panic and fell to the floor covering my mouth. My phone buzzed with text from an unknown number. This is your delivery driver. Where is your husband? Are you still by yourself right now? I didn't respond, but my hands were shaking. Another text came through immediately. Please answer. It's important. Through a crack in the blinds, I watched him get out of His car and walk back toward my house. The pounding of my heart filled my ears. I crawled around, turning off all the lights, closing all the blinds on the first floor. Then a third text. I'm outside. Two words that made my spine tingle. I heard his footsteps on my front porch, gently knocking like he didn't want to scare me even more than I already was. Annabelle, he said, voice calm and eerie. Annabelle, I know you're in there. Please come out. I couldn't take it anymore and figured if I threatened him with the cops, he'd leave. I stupidly opened the door just a crack with the chain still on. You need to leave or I'm calling the police. Before I could react, his hand shot through the gap and unhooked the chain. He grabbed my arm and dragged me out of my house. I tried to scream but he was already throwing me into his back seat and slamming the door. I tried to leave but the child lock trapped me inside. I kicked at the window weakly, even screamed. As he calmly got into the driver seat. He reached down and pulled out a baseball bat that he said in the passenger seat, call the cops, he told me what I said. Suddenly thrown so far off, all the panic drained from my body in an instance. Call the cops now. He repeated it while staring straight ahead at my house. His hands were on The steering wheel. And he wasn't even looking at me. I fumbled with my phone and dialed 9, 1 1. There's a delivery driver. And he grabbed me and forced me into his car. I told the dispatcher, but even as I said it, something felt wrong. Why would he want me to call the.

Tobacco Harris Duke Legacy. Father owned a billion dollar company. The wedding was planned before our fifth date, scheduled for the family foundation's 100 anniversary gala. My parents had already commissioned the oil painting of our future children. Two weeks before the wedding, my brother called. We're adopting them. All three kids, Carlos and I are going to be dads. My heart broke. My parents first grandchildren, three of them, and they'd never know. Three kids who desperately needed grandparents never had a stable family. And my parents would rather pretend they didn't exist unless I thought. At our rehearsal dinner with 500 guests, including the governor at our table, I stood up for the toast, pulled out my phone. Before I marry Isabella, everyone should see who's missing. I. I took the photo on the wall, my brother and Carlos at the adoption ceremony. Three kids clinging to them like life rafts. The oldest 10, holding his straight a report card. The middle child in his soccer uniform. It overcame developmental delays and now LED his team. The youngest with her violin headed to state competition. Everyone gasped, shocked, unsure how to feel. My brother isn't dead. He's happy. He's married to a brilliant surgeon and these are your grandchildren. I looked at my parents that you'll never meet because your homophobic hatred matters more than three kids who need a family. My father stood up. Shake those Aren't real grandchildren. But Isabella's hypothetical children are. Children who don't exist are more real than three kids who call him daddy. My mother was crying, you're destroying everything. You destroyed everything when you threw away your son for liking the wrong gender, she yelled. The bloodline ends with him disgusted. The bloodline. Carlos saves babies for a living. My brother runs a free clinic. Those three kids were thrown away by their bloodlines. But sure, let's talk about legacy. The governor was already leaving. Isabella's family followed. The wedding was off before the appetizers arrived. Parents screamed about the shame, the ruined foundation gala, the million dollar wedding they couldn't get refunded. Good. I said, now you know how those three kids felt when their biological families threw them away. Except my brother chose them. You're throwing away grandchildren who already exist. Kicked me out that night. Drained my accounts, too. But I'd already taken out loans already matched at a residency program. I already knew where I was going. My brother opened his door at midnight. We just held each other and cried. That was five years ago. I'm Uncle Rob now. Help with homework, teach the oldest premed concepts since he tests at college level. Watch the middle one score soccer goals at front row at violin recitals. Those three kids my parents said weren't real. They're honor students, athletes, musicians. They're loved. My parents still tell people they have no children. Spent 3 million on fertility treatments. For my cousin rather than acknowledge three grandchildren exist.

I was 15 when I got pregnant, except it wasn't on purpose. You see, like every other 15 year old girl, my boyfriend was toxic. Like scream at you for interacting with a male teacher, then go through your phone. Toxic. So when he caught me going to the hospital to visit my godfather without telling him, he was determined to punish me. He told me the only way he'd let me get away with it was if I let him pop my cherry with no rubber. He said that would prove that I loved him and I would have said no, but the anger in his eyes made me too scared of what would happen if I dared to refuse. So I said yes. Long story short, I got pregnant and never saw him again. I wish that was an exaggeration, but he blocked me on everything and transferred to a school across the country. I was so freaked out that I told my parents as soon as I found out, we'll help you take care of it was the first thing my mom said. Meanwhile, my dad just nodded quietly. I don't know why I believe them, but I did. And their words were the only reason I didn't get a baby unalive because no one else wanted to come near me anymore. The entire school was calling me a w word and they had spread rumors about me. Trying to baby trap my ex boy friend. So I dropped out. All I had was my parents and everything they gave me until I gave birth. Because instead of coming home to baby Anna's nursery, I came home to all of my stuff packed up into bags. I swear I thought they were pranking me. But then my mom said we're not cleaning up the mess you made. I looked over to my dad who stood there with his arms crossed. But I thought you said we just said that so you wouldn't terminate the pregnancy, but now we're done with you. Consider yourself disowned. I fell to the floor crying while baby Anna whipped in my arms. I had nowhere to go and instead of helping me drive somewhere, they retreated to their bedrooms and locked the door. I was shattered. That was my rock bottom. I ended up getting an Uber to my Aunt Becky's house and she took me in. As soon as she showed me the bedroom, I crawled right in and fell asleep. I was still in the post pregnancy state and life felt like it was doomed. I woke up the next morning at 4:00am to Becky shaking me awake. If you're staying here, then you have to follow the rules was all she said before handing me a sweeping brush. You have to do your fair share of everything. Two hours of house chores minimum. You have to cook me five dinners. A week. Showers are five minutes long max. And most importantly, if your baby wakes me up more than once in a week, I will kick you out. Well, it was either Aunt Becky's house or the streets. So I just nodded, ready to accept my new life of modern day slavery. The next few years of my life were as bad as you'd expect. Every time Anna cried at night, adrenaline would pump through my blood. Sometimes I even had to sit with her in the front garden during winter. And Aunt Becky abused me in every way possible, so much so that it reminded me of my ex boyfriend. And I only had one lifeline, a job at a 24 hour diner where the manager, Rosa, let me bring Anna during night shifts. He'd sleep in the break room while I served coffee to truckers and studied for my GED between orders. The day Anna turned 4, I finally had enough, saved $1,200 and a promise of a studio apartment from Rosa's cousin. I packed our things while Becky was at work, not that there was much to pack. Anna's drawings, the teddy bear Rosa gave her, my GED certificate. That studio apartment was 400 square feet of heaven. Our first night, Anna and I ate McDonald's on the floor and she said, Mama, can we be loud here? When I nodded, she squealed at the top of her lungs, then looked at me with wonder when no One yelled at us. That's when they showed up. I was at a pickup helping Anna carry her solar system project to the car when I saw them, my parents standing next to a Mercedes looking like they'd stepped out of a catalog. My dad wore a suit that probably cost more than I made in three months. Suddenly, my mother was walking toward us. Hello, sweetheart, she said. But she wasn't looking at me. She was looking at Anna with tears in her eyes. You must be Anna, I shoved.

She still thinks she's learning how to flirt. Trish started working at my waitressing job five months ago, and from the moment she saw my boyfriend Kaio, she set her eyes on him like he was the last Infinity Stone. He was half Japanese like me, meaning we related on a deep level, and for some reason Trish hated this the most. First time she saw us having lunch, she made herself comfortable in my seat next to his. When I got up to use the bathroom, she pressed her hips against his and flashed a flirty smile before saying konnichiwa. When he awkwardly set it back, she grabbed a pair of chopsticks and started eating noodles, unsuccessfully complaining about whitewashed girls appropriating his beautiful culture, very obviously referring to me. When I came back from the bathroom, she told me to grab a chair, telling me I was welcome to join in on their conversation. It definitely struck a nerve, but I was so secure in Kaido and I's relationship, I didn't even mind until Trish started trying to implode us. She'd corner him when I wasn't looking and tell him innuendo style phrases in Japanese that she got off Google Translate. Whenever we were talking, she'd always squeeze past us very slowly, sometimes making sure to rub her behind against Kaido, and other times facing him directly and giving him the effing eyes. The Thing that really made me mad was when she asked Kaido to come teach her Japanese at her house after work. I was going to confront her there and then. But we were in the middle of a very busy service. And I told myself I'd do it right after. Big mistake. You see, at some point during service, these important Japanese businessmen came in for food. They were at my section. But Trish practically shoved me aside to serve them. Please speak Japanese. I understand everything she told them. They looked pleasantly surprised and started rattling off their order with specific modifications and allergies. Trish just kept saying hi, hi! While scribbling nonsense. Forty five minutes later, it was chaos. One guy got served the wrong starter. Another received two sushi orders instead of his chicken chow Mein. And the third guy actually started having an allergic reaction to shellfish, which he asked to exclude. That's when Trish did it. While Kaido ran to get the Epipen, she pointed at me and told her cousin, who is the manager, that I changed the order to sabotage her. And without verifying anything, her cousin wrote me up on the spot in front of everyone. One more incident and you're terminated. I went home crushed and just cried to Kaido. I was wondering

My best friend Jess was getting married and asked me to be her photographer. I've been doing photography for like three years now, mostly just for fun and some side cash, but nothing super professional. She said she trusted me more than some random person and honestly couldn't afford a real wedding photographer anyway. The wedding was beautiful. I spent the entire day running around getting shots of everything. Her getting ready, walking down the aisle, the first kiss, all the family photos. I was exhausted but felt good about it. I probably took like 800 photos that day. After the reception, just pulled me aside and said she couldn't wait to see them. He was literally glowing with excitement. I told her I'd edit them and have them ready in a week. That's when things got weird. Two days later, just texted me asking if I could rush the photos because her and her husband Jake wanted to post them on social media. I said sure, no problem. But then she started texting me every single day asking for updates. Like multiple times a day. Then she called me crying saying her mom was asking about the photos and could I please just send her like five unedited ones. I sent her a few thinking that would calm her down. Wrong. The next day she showed up at my apartment unannounced. She had Jake with her and they both looked Stressed? She said they needed to talk about the photos. Apparently, just's mom had been showing the unedited photos I sent to family members, and now everyone was asking why the photographer didn't know how to use proper lighting. Just said she was embarrassed and needed me to fix them immediately. I explained that editing takes time and I was working on them, but she cut me off and said she'd found another photographer who could fix my mistakes for $500. He wanted me to send her all the raw files so this other person could edit them instead. I was honestly hurt. These weren't even bad photos. The lighting was a little dim in a few shots because the venue was dark, but nothing that couldn't be fixed in editing. That's literally what editing is for. But here's where it gets really messed up. When I hesitated about sending the raw files, Jake stepped in and said they weren't paying me anything anyway, so I should just hand them over. He said they'd already been more than generous, letting me practice on their wedding. Practice? I had busted my ass for 12 hours straight on their wedding day. I barely ate, missed most of the reception, and my feet were killing me from running around in heels all day. That's when Jess said something that made my blood boil. She looked me dead in the eye and said, if I was a

So my boss, Rachel, is basically the coolest person at our advertising agency. Last month, she sent out the group text about her party on Friday night. Everyone was hyped, talking about it during lunch breaks, planning what to wear, the whole thing. But I never got the text. I figured maybe she just forgot to add me or maybe my phone was being weird. Thursday rolls around and I'm hearing more party talk. People are discussing who's bringing what drinks and someone mentioned the karaoke machine. I'm starting to feel pretty left out, but I don't want to seem desperate by asking about it. Friday afternoon comes and everyone's buzzing about getting ready after work. That's when I finally worked up the courage to walk into Rachel's office. I knocked on her door and she looked up with this bright smile. Hey, what's up? She said. I took a deep breath. So, um, I think there might have been a mix up. I didn't get the text about tonight's party. Her face immediately changed like all the color just drained out of it. She stared at me for what felt like forever before clearing her throat. Oh, right about that, she started fidgeting with her pen. The thing is, this party is more of a core team event. Core team. I've been there for two years. I worked overtime constantly and never complained. I brought donuts every Friday. And covered for people when they were sick. What do you mean core team? I asked. She couldn't even look at me. Well, you know, people who are more central to the office dynamic. That hit me like a punch to the gut. I just nodded and walked out. The whole office cleared out at 5 sharp, and I sat there alone, pretending to work while everyone else headed to have fun without me. But here's where it gets interesting. Around 9 that night, I get a call from my friend Jamie, who works in accounting. She's whispering and sounds panicked. Dude, you need to check Rachel's Instagram Story, like right now. I open Instagram and there's Rachel's story from the party. Everyone's having a blast, dancing, playing beer pong. But in the background of one video, I see.

We got married for a green card. I know how that sounds, but hear me out. Elena needed to stay in the country to finish med school. I was broke and desperate to split rent in San Francisco where even studio apartments cost more than my monthly salary. My roommate Ben, suggested his girlfriend's friend who was facing deportation. She clean, quiet and desperate, he said. Perfect match for your situation. We met at a Mission District Starbucks on a Tuesday. She was already there when I arrived, punched over thick medical textbooks, highlighter marks all over her hands, dark circles under her eyes, told me she'd been pulling all nighters. When I sat down, she looked up and said, you must be the guy who needs a wife. Straight to business. I liked that. We talked for exactly 47 minutes. She needed legal status to avoid losing her medical school spot three months before graduation. I needed someone to help cover my 15 dollar rent. We both needed to convince immigration we were legit. She had no criminal record. I had good credit. Perfect strangers entering a contract. The wedding was just us and two witnesses at city hall on a Thursday morning. I wore my only good shirt. She wore a white dress from target that still had the tags on it. We exchanged rings from a convenience store, took an Awkward selfie for immigration files and shook hands afterward like we just closed a business deal. Our apartment became a study in polite coexistence. Claimed the living room as her study space. Medical textbooks creating fortress walls around her. I worked double shifts at a tech startup, coming home exhausted while she was already deep in flashcards. We'd pass each other in our tiny kitchen, maybe say good morning, share the coffee maker and careful shifts. For six months, we were like the world's most courteous strangers. She studied 18 hours a day, surviving on instant ramen and determination. I worked 70 hour weeks trying to prove myself at a company that treated junior developers like this, posible coffee filters. We developed a rhythm of avoidance that somehow worked. I'd leave her dinner leftovers in the fridge. She'd buy my preferred coffee creamer without being asked. Then my dad had a massive heart attack. I got the call at 2:00am from my sister crying so hard I could barely understand her. Dad's in the ICU. You need to come home now. I just collapsed in our hallway, phone still in my hand, making sounds I didn't recognize as my own voice. Elena found me there 20 minutes later, coming back from a late library session. She didn't ask questions, didn't say anything about how pathetic I looked. She just sat next to me on the floor and held my hand while I fell apart. Her thumb traced small circles on My knuckles while I tried to explain through broken sentences that my dad might die and I couldn't afford the plane ticket home to Chicago. She drove me to the airport in her beat up Honda at 4:00am, waited with me until my flight boarded and pressed $200 cash into my hand. For whatever you need, she said quietly. When I came back a week later, drained and grieving but grateful my dad had survived, she'd meal prepped containers filling our entire fridge. Little notes stuck to each one. Heat for three minutes, add hot sauce, your favourite chicken teriyaki. She'd also somehow paid our full rent while I was gone. Something shifted after that. She started asking about my day when I got home. I began making enough dinner for two without discussing it, she'd fall.

My co worker stole my lunch straight out of the fridge and then accused me of attempted murder when their throat started closing up. Careful with that pad tie, my friend said as I walked past her desk Tuesday morning. The food thief's been especially bold lately. I just laughed it off because I've been working here for a year and my lunch had never been touched. And besides, my name was written in black sharpie across the lid of my distinctive purple container. Who would be stupid enough to steal something so clearly labeled? But things had apparently gotten so bad that my coworker started writing contains laxatives on her perfectly normal sandwiches, and I've been stupidly confident that my luck would continue. I was deep in my work when I heard what sounded like someone knocking over chairs in the break room. Then Derek, our newly promoted director, came stumbling out with his face already going puffy and red. His hands were at his throat, and he was making these horrible wheezing sounds. Epipen! He gasped, fumbling at his pockets. Can't breathe. Someone called 9 1 1 while another co worker helped him with the Epipen. In the chaos, I ran to see what happened and found my purple container open on the counter. My pad Thai was half eaten, and my name in black marker stared up at me like an accusation. The peanut sauce was still Visible on the fork. My boss called me into his office the next day. I have to ask, I said, looking uncomfortable, did you know Derek had a peanut allergy? I told him I had no idea. Derek and I barely interact, and it's not like he wore a medical alert bracelet or ever mentioned it. I pulled out that day's lunch, which was also pad Thai, because I made a huge batch and ate several bites in front of him. This is literally what I eat three times a week, I said. He nodded, seeming satisfied. Derek shouldn't have taken your food. This is on him. I thought that was the end of it. Then a week later, HR called me in for a formal investigation. Derek sat there with the HR director, arms crossed, explaining how I'd obviously targeted him. She's been jealous ever since my promotion, he said, giving me this condescending look. He claimed he only borrowed food when he had back to back meetings, like it was some noble sacrifice. She left it right in front like they. The HR director, a woman I'd never seen smile, was bizarrely aggressive. When my boss tried to defend me by saying the container was clearly labeled, she wouldn't even look at him. We can't prove Derek stole anything, she said. For all we know, you offered it to him. This looks like a calculated attack on someone in a vulnerable position. Then she actually suggested Derek should Sue me for reckless endangerment and emotional distress from nearly dying. My boss kept trying to interject, but she steamrolled over him every time. This could be considered assault, she said, leaning forward. You brought a deadly weapon into the workplace. It's pad Thai, I said. It's food. My food with my name on it. Two days later, I was called into HR and fired on the spot. She seized her opportunity perfectly. With the owner gone on business for the past month, she knew no one could stop her. She cited workplace endangerment and malicious intent, then had security escort me through the office with my belongings in a cardboard box, making sure everyone saw me leave like some kind of criminal. The humiliation lasted about as long as my drive home, but

What she accidentally overheard during the appointment made me uninvite my entire bridal party. I was dead asleep, and my phone rang at midnight. The caller ID showed a number I didn't recognize, but something made me answer. Is this Rachel? A woman's voice thick with tears. Yes. Who is this? My name is Carla. I'm a spray tan artist at Bronzo. I just. I need to tell you something about your wedding, about your bridesmaids. I sat up suddenly wide awake. My wedding was in five days. My entire bridal party had appointments at Bronzo tomorrow for matching spray tans. Your maid of honor, Jessica, came in tonight for an early appointment. Carla, I continued, she was on speaker phone the whole time. I heard everything. I couldn't sleep without telling you. What did you hear? Carla took a shaky breath. They're planning to ruin your wedding. All of them. They have a whole plan. My stomach dropped. That's impossible. These are my best friend. I recorded it. Carla said. I know I shouldn't have, but it was so horrible. I'll send you the audio. The recording came through immediately. I recognized Jessica's voice right away. Talking to someone on speaker while Carla worked. Operation Ugly Bride is a go. Jessica laughed. Everyone knows their role. My bridesmaid Ashley's voice responded. I got the dress. My seamstress friend is taking it in four sizes tonight. Rachel won't Know, until she tries to zip it tomorrow. Another voice. My cousin Megan. I booked the wrong makeup artist, the one who did that Halloween zombie wedding. Told her Rachel wants dramatic look. Perfect, Jessica said. And I confirmed with the DJ. He's going to play nothing but Rachel's ex's favorite songs, including their song for the Father Daughter Dance. I listened in horror as they detailed their plan. The flowers have been changed to the ones I was allergic to. The photographer was instructed to only take unflattering angles. They'd even coordinated their bridesmaid dress malfunctions to happen during the ceremony. Why? Ashley asked in the recording. I mean, I'm in, but remind me why we're destroying her wedding. Jessica's voice turned cold. Because she doesn't deserve Chris. She. I think she's so perfect with her perfect job and perfect life. Someone needs to bring her down. Plus, Chris had feelings for me first. He only asked her out because I was dating Brad. Girl, that was five years ago, Megan pointed out. Doesn't matter. I introduced them. He was supposed to be mine. This wedding is a joke. The recording continued with more details. They've been planning this for months, ever since I asked Jessica to be my maid of honor. Every supportive text, every planning session, every happy moment had been fake. The best part, Jessica giggled, is the speech I'm giving. I'm going to tell everyone about her anxiety attacks. That time she wet herself at Camp in seventh grade. How Chris almost broke up with her last year because she's so clingy. She'll die of embarrassment. Ashley agreed. Maybe she'll run out of her own wedding. That's the goal. Chris will see what a mess she is and realize he made a mistake. Carla came back on the line. I'm so sorry. Had to tell you. No one deserves that. I hung up and immediately called Chris. He answered groggily until I played in the recording. I heard him get out of bed. He's jingling. I'm coming over, he said. This is insane. We spent the night contacting vendors. The florist confirmed the flower change. The DJ admitted to the playlist swap. The makeup artist thought the zombie request was weird but assumed it was a themed wedding. The seamstress had already taken in my dress when we picked it up at 3:00am. After threatening legal action. It was unwearable, four sizes smaller, with the seams reinforced so they couldn't be let out. By 6:00am, we had a new plan. I called each bridesmaid individually, starting with Jessica. Hey, can't wait for today's tanning session? She chirped. Actually, there's been a change. The wedding is off. Silence. Then what? Why? Chris and I decided to elope. Too much stress. We're flying to Vegas this afternoon. Jessica tried to sound supportive, but I heard the disappointment. Oh, but all the planning. Yeah. You can cancel your spray tan appointment. Sorry for the inconvenience. I made similar Calls to the others. Each one

I told him I had feelings for you. You did? Yeah. I was going to ask you out. Ryan. What? When I told Michael, he laughed at me. Why? He said you were out of my league. That's awful. He said someone like you would never date someone like me. I would have said yes if you asked. I really wished you asked me. We could have changed the course of our lives. Ryan, really? It's too late now, is it, Ryan? Is it too late? Think about it. Well, Michael said I was delusional. So what was the bet? He bet me he could get you to marry him. What? He said, if someone like me thought I had a chance with you, then you must be desperate. He said that. He said bagging you would be easy. I'm going to be sick. Sarah, I'm so sorry. How long was the bet for? A year. A year. He had a year to marry you and he won. He kept showing me all your posts to prove he won. That's why he wanted you to see them. Yeah. He was rubbing it in my face. Oh, my God. I should have told you sooner. I feel so stupid. You're not stupid. I am. I fell for it. He's a good manipulator. I need to confront him. Be careful, Sarah. Thank you for telling me. I'm sorry this happened to you. We need to talk about what the bet? What bet? Don't play dumb. I don't know what you're talking about. Ryan told me everything. Ryan's a liar. No, you're the liar. Sarah. Calm down. Calm down. You married me for a bet. So what if I did? So what? Yes. Or what? You ruined my life. How did I ruin your life? You made me believe you loved me. Look at yourself. You look like an ad for antidepressant.

My girlfriend came home at 2:00am with her underwear and dress torn open screaming for me to help her. She collapsed into my arms and I could feel her whole body trembling. She kept throwing up and shaking all over our carpet. I helped her to the couch and got her a glass of water while trying to stay calm myself because I was sure my worst fear just happened. Luna is without a doubt the strongest person I know. She worked as a prosecutor and dealt with assailers, PDF files and slaughterers every day without flinching. But now she looked broken and small, literally rocking on our couch, kept apologizing for ruining my night, which made no sense. And I assured her she did nothing wrong. At the club, some guy had cornered her outside the bathroom when she was alone. According to her, he towered over her, was super muscular and his breath reek of whiskey. He pushed her against the wall and put his hands where they didn't belong while she screamed for help. The music was too loud and her friends were too far away. She tried to fight back but he already had his way with her. The worst part was what happened next. Luna found security and told them exactly what occurred. She pointed out the guy who was laughing with his friends near the VIP section. The bouncer just shrugged and said, what do You want me to do without any witnesses, lady? he leaned in close and told her that the guy was the owner's nephew, so maybe she should just go home and sleep it off and that it probably wasn't that bad. I felt rage building in my chest as Juna explained how the manager said the same thing, how her friends wanted to call the police, but the staff threatened to ban them, all of them, from every club in a 5 mile radius for causing trouble. Literally. Other women at the club whispered that the same guy had done this before, but nothing ever happened. Police protected him because his uncle owned three clubs in the city. Juno was a prosecutor who put criminals away for a living, but even she knew this would go nowhere. Rich guys with connections didn't face consequences for raping women in dark clubs. There would be no cameras in that hallway and no witnesses willing to testify. The system she worked for every day had failed her completely. I held her while she cried and felt more helpless than ever before in my life. I didn't know people who could handle this kind of thing. There was nothing I could do that would touch that man. But then I remembered that my father would know what to do. My dad had spent 30 years working construction in the roughest parts of the city. He knew people from a different world than mine. People who handled problems outside the law when the law wouldn't help. I spent my whole life trying to distance myself from that part of his past, but now I needed it. The next morning while Juno was sleeping, I drove to my parents house. My dad was drinking coffee in the garage like always, surrounded by his tools and old boxing trophies. I told him everything and watched his face go from confused to furious. He sat down his mug so hard it spilled everywhere. You know the guy's name? He asked in a voice I'd never heard before. I showed him the club's Instagram where the nephew was tagged in VIP photos flashing expensive watches and bottles. My dad studied the pictures like he was memorizing every detail of the guy's face. My father made some calls right there in the garage. I could only hear his side of the conversations, but they were short and serious. He used names I didn't recognize and mentioned favours that were owed. When he hung up, he told me to go home and take care of Junah. He said he would handle everything else. Three days later, the local news reported that the club owner's nephew had been found in an alley behind one of his uncle's properties. Both his hands were broken in multiple places. His ribs were all broken, his eyes were swollen and he had a 1,000 dollar bottle of tequila shoved up his bum, the report said. No witnesses came forward and no cameras covered that particular alley, so they couldn't prosecute anyone. The interesting part was what they found in his apartment during.

My billionaire uncle taught me his trick when I turned 25 and inherited his pharmaceutical company. He said, never let them see the real you first. Make them fall for broke you. So I created a fake dating profile as Mike the struggling musician, posted photos in my crappiest clothes, mentioned my time, any studio apartment, and ramen diet. I even got a part time job at Guitar Center to sell the story. I matched with Emma, who seemed perfect. She was studying to be a veterinarian, drove her mom's old Corolla, and always suggested cheap date spots like food trucks and free concerts in the park. She'd split, put every Bill down to the penny, insisting she knew how tight money was for musicians. After three months, I was falling hard. She'd bring me homemade lunches to Guitar Center, saying she made extra and didn't want it to go to waste. Never asked about my music career or pushed me to make it big. She just seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with Broke Mike. Then she started acting strange. She'd disappear for hours with vague excuses about studying at the library. She'd make secretive phone calls and step outside when I was around. Once I saw expensive designer shopping bags in her backseat that she quickly covered with a blanket when she noticed me looking. I was getting paranoid. Was she cheating? Was I just her bro boyfriend while she Had some rich guy on the side. I hired a private investigator thinking she was seeing someone else. The report came back with photos that made my jaw drop. Emma entering a massive mansion with a circular driveway. Emma stepping out of a brand new Tesla Model S. Emma in an evening gown, shaking hands with the mayor at some charity gala. I was curious. Here I was, pretending to be poor to avoid gold diggers, while she was living this secret rich life and playing me for a fool. I confronted her at what I thought was her small apartment near campus. Turns out it was just the guest house on her family's estate. Emma? Who the hell are you, really? She looked terrified and broke down crying. My dad owns the largest chain of veterinary hospitals in the state. My family's worth over $200 million. But every guy I've dated since high school only wanted me to fund their business ideas, introduce them to my rich friends. She wiped her eyes, mascara running. I've been living in the guest house and driving Mom's old car because I wanted to meet someone who'd like me when they thought I had nothing. You're the first person who never asked me for money or tried to impress me with expensive plans you couldn't afford. She looked at my shocked face. Please don't hate me, Mike. I know I lied, but I was just so tired of guys seeing dollar signs instead of Me? That's when I started laughing hysterically. Emma, I need to tell you something about my pharmaceutical company. Her confused expression was priceless. Remember how I said I inherited some money from my uncle? Well, he didn't just leave me money. He left me the entire company. I'm worth about $800 million. We just stared at each other in this ridiculous guest house. Two rich people who'd been pretending to be broke because we were both terrified of being used. She started laughing, too. So you're telling me I've been buying you lunch because I thought you were struggling, while you've been letting me pay because you thought I was a poor vet student. Pretty

My wife was 8 months pregnant when her body started rejecting both the baby and her. We were at a routine checkup when Doctor Sins went quiet during the ultrasound. He called for a second doctor, then a third. Their hushed conversations in the corner made my stomach drop. Severe preeclampsia. He finally said, we need to deliver today. But there was a complication. The baby's cord was wrapped around his neck three times. Any attempt to deliver naturally would likely put his life in serious danger. But a C section with my wife's blood pressure that high could have put her life at serious risk. The doctors explained our options in clinical terms that felt surreal. Emergency delivery with baby survival rates at 30% or wait for her condition to stabilize with baby survival dropping to near zero. How long do we have to decide? I asked. You don't, Doctor Sin said. I need an answer now. My wife grabbed my hand. Her grip was weak, but her voice was clear. Save him. I looked at the woman I'd loved for eight years, the person who made me coffee every morning, who still left me stupid love notes in my lunch, who was asking me to let her die for someone we've never even met. No, I said. The room went silent. My wife's eyes filled with tears. Save her, I told the doctors. Whatever it takes. They rushed her into Surgery for an emergency C section anyway, the safest compromise they could try. I sat in the waiting room for two hours, fearing that my decision might have cost our son his life to save my wife. When Doctor Sins finally came out, his scrubs showed the toll of the operation. Your wife is.

My friend Katie always had something to say about my face. Every time we hung out, she'd make these little comments like you'd look so much better with just some mascara or I have lipstick that would really help you out. I kept brushing it off because we've been friends since middle school and I figured she meant well. But then came her engagement party last month. I showed up in a nice dress, hair done, feeling good about myself. Katie took one look at me and said, oh, honey, you really should have told me you weren't doing makeup. I would have brought my kit. She said it loud enough for everyone to hear, including her fiance's family, who I was meeting for the first time. I felt my face turn red. Her mom even chimed in saying, Katie's right, dear, a little colour would really brighten you up. I spent the whole night feeling like everyone was staring at my bare face. Katie kept introducing me as her natural friend with this fake sweet smile. That night I texted my sister about it. She was furious and said Katie was being a total jerk. Then she offered to do my makeup for the wedding since she works at Sephora. I told her no at first because I didn't want to be petty. But she convinced me that looking good wasn't About Katie, it was about me feeling confident. Two weeks before the wedding, my sister and I went shopping. We got everything, foundation, concealer, eyeshadow, palettes, the works. She taught me how to do a full glam look that made my eyes pop and my skin look flawless. We practiced three times until I could do it myself. Morning of Katie's wedding, I woke up at 6:00am to start getting ready. I did my makeup exactly like my sister taught me, then put on this stunning blue dress I've been saving for a special occasion. When I looked in the mirror, I barely recognized myself. I looked amazing. I got to the church early and found my seat.

We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing.

The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, I said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night, just stood in the doorway clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development, their church pastor who believed homosexuality was a choice. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp Restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires, just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We were Constantly monitored, no privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One, one night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his work bench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice. And I apologized over and over. I, I promised I would talk to him, but deep down, I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, I said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

She put in $34,000, $30,000 from her parents, plus $4,000 saved. Ownership would be sixty forty, reflecting our contributions. I'd already sent my $50,000 to escrow two weeks ago. Claire said she was sorting out her parents transfer. We had time before the deadline. Then came dinner at her parents house. Her mom had prepared an elaborate feast. Clearly something was brewing. Midway through the meal, Claire tapped her glass. I've been reflecting on our future and I've made a decision. I think we need a prenup. Everything stays separate. What's mine is mine. What's yours is yours. Her father immediately chimed in. Wise move, Claire. Safeguarding assets is smart. Claire flashed that smug smile she uses when she thinks she's outsmarted someone. We keep our money separate, file taxes apart, and if something happens, we each walk away with what we brought. She explained confidently. Even the house? I asked. No, the house would be shared. We're both on the deed. But once we're married, it's joint property, equal split. The audacity was breathtaking. She wanted complete financial separation. When It suited her. But equal ownership of the asset I was primarily funding. I've been planning this for weeks. While I transferred my life savings. But here's what Claire didn't know.

Getting me to cover most of the house while protect taking her family's money. A mutual friend mentioned she'd called me a bank with a proposal, so I consulted my lawyer about the purchase agreement.

I was sitting in the living room eating chocolates I found when my mom yelled, are you eating those chocolates? Yeah, I said, looking up from the couch where I've been watching cartoons, my fingers still covered in melted chocolate. Mom's face went from confused to absolutely horrified in about half a second. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! She was actually shaking, staring at the half empty box of fancy chocolates on the coffee table. How many did you eat? How many? Like five or six. You had a whole box of them? But she wasn't listening anymore. She was already screaming for dad. Get in here now! Dad came running from his office so fast he slipped on the hallway rug. And when he saw me with chocolate on my face and mom pointing at the box with a trembling hand, his eyes went wide. No, no, no! Oh, tell me he didn't. He ate them. He ate at least five. Mom was practically hyperventilating now. Dad grabbed the box, read something on the bottom, and actually had to sit down on the arm of the couch. I didn't mean to leave them there. I thought they were in our bedroom. I specifically hid them in our bedroom. What's wrong with the chocolate? I asked, but my voice came out all squeaky because they were scaring me so bad. Mom was facing back and forth, muttering, Things like, he's only 10, and who knows what this could do to him? Maybe it won't be that bad, dad said, but he didn't sound like he believed it. Maybe at his age, his body won't. Are you kidding me right now? Mom screamed so loud that my sister came running downstairs. She took one look at the scene. Me covered in chocolate, mom crying, dad looking like he might throw up, and the fancy box on the table. And her jaw literally dropped open. Mom, you

We were all at Grandma's birthday party, and I noticed how Aunt Penn was giving mom special compliments all night. Rosie, that dress almost hides your weight gain. Almost, she would say, before smiling sweetly. Then she touched Mom's face. You're so brave wearing makeup at your age. Most women would just give up. Mom's eyes got watery, which meant she was really touched. Aunt Penn even complimented my dad, saying, yours such a saint for sticking around with her. Most men would have found someone younger by now. Mom's hands were shaking when she cut the cake, probably from happiness. On the drive home, mom was really quiet, and when dad asked if she was okay, she said something about passive aggressiveness, which I didn't understand, but I figured it must be another way adults say I love you. I decided that if Aunt Penn loved mom so much that she gave her all those special compliments, I should do the same thing for Aunt Penn, because I love her, too. The next Sunday at church, I saw my chance. When Aunt Penn walked up wearing a pretty, flowery dress, I remembered exactly how she talked to mom and said to her, wow, Aunt Penn, you look pregnant in that dress. When's the baby coming? Her face went completely white, then red, then kind of purple, and she just stood there with her Mouth open like a goldfish. Mom, who was talking to Missus Abernathy, turned around so fast she almost spilled her coffee. And then she started coughing really hard, but it sounded more like laughing for some reason. Aunt Penn finally said, thank you, sweetie, in this tiny voice, and mom had to excuse herself to go to the bathroom because she was coughing laughing so much. Dad asked me what I said, and when I told him I was just being nice like Aunt Penn, he got this funny look.

My teacher made us all have assigned seating, and I got stuck in the back next to the quiet kid. He always weirded me out. Never talked to anyone, just drew these weird, dark sketches in his notebook during lectures. But that Tuesday morning started normal. I was trying to stay awake when a piece of paper slid onto my desk from his direction. Note was folded into a tight square, and when I opened it, his handwriting was surprisingly neat. Enjoy your last few minutes alive. My first thought was that this was some weird prank. Maybe he was finally trying to make friends in the most awkward way possible. So I turned back to give him a confused look, but his face was serious. Another note hit my desk. Just one word. Look. I glanced back and saw his backpack partially open, something dark and metallic visible inside. It was a handgun. My hands started shaking so bad, I dropped my pencil. Our teacher was writing formulas and had no idea what was going on. 28 other students in the room. My mind raced through the options. I could run out the door right now, save myself, but everyone else would be at risk. I could yell at everyone to run, but his hand was already halfway in his bag, and I'd probably be first. I. I pulled the fire alarm, but it was across the Room. My stomach churned, and I genuinely thought I might throw up right there on my desk. Then it hit me. The bathroom pass. I could ask to go to the bathroom, walk past it to the office. Warn them quietly. They could call the police. Lock down the school. Do it.

When I told him they invited me for dinner, Theo said it was just family. I walk in, and there's this dental surgeon sitting on our couch wearing a bow tie. A bow tie. My mother introduces him like she's presenting a prize. This is Cameron. He has his own practice. Theo looked up from his laptop. What did you do? I sat through three hours of him explaining different. Different types of dental floss. Did you know there's waxed, unwaxed tape and ultra thin? Because I do now. I slumped in my chair. My mom kept kicking me under the table whenever I checked my phone. Then she follows me to the bathroom and says he has excellent benefits and a summer house. Compelling argument, Theo said. I sighed, staring at him while he stared at his laptop like it was the only thing that mattered. I actually do need to get married, though, don't I, Theo? Stop typing completely. He looked at me for a long moment. I swallowed hard at the sudden eye contact, and he closed his laptop. If you're going to get married, will you marry me? I waited for the punchline. It didn't come. That's not funny. I'm not joking, Theo. You Just proposed while I was complaining about my mother. Who does that? Someone who's been waiting four years for the right moment and just realized there isn't one. He stood up, walked to his filing cabinet. This is coming out wrong. At least he was self aware. He pulled out a folder from the bottom drawer. My name was written on the tab. Do you remember the Valdez acquisition? That was four years ago. We were both senior analysts.

Grandfather's smile faded as he studied my wife's hand. The four carat edwardian diamond worth $82,000 that grandma specifically gave your mother to give to you when she went into hospice. She wanted you to have it for this sweet girl who spent every Sunday with her for five years. My mother's champagne glass shattered against her dinner plate, sending golden liquid pooling across the tablecloth. Dad, you're confused.

Give me caramel macchiatos and teaching me technology and listening to all my stories. The ring threw rainbow prisms across the walls as she held it up.

By the time I was 17, I had already raised eight of my mom's adopted children. You see, my mom was obsessed with social status. Every adoption got her another newspaper article, another 10,000 likes on Facebook. The thing was, she never actually wanted to parent them. That was my job. It all started when I was 9 and she brought home the first baby. Immature infant from Guatemala who needed round the clock care. You're so mature for your age, she'd said, handing me the feeding schedule at 3 a m. This will teach you responsibility. Well, I was making the kids packed lunches when she called a family meeting and slid photos across the table. Three babies from Ukraine, all under 2, one with cerebral palsy. Mom, I can't do this anymore, I said, voice shaking. I need to finish school. I've already missed 47 days this year. She tilted her head. Are you saying you won't help these innocent children? I'm saying I'm 17 and exhausted. That night, after everyone was asleep, she came to my room. Fine. Don't help. She showed me their medical files. But either you care for them, she said quietly, or they suffer. Your choice. My head spun while I processed what she was saying. She knew I couldn't watch babies suffer, that I would always choose them over me. The next morning, I tested the waters. Instead of staying home with Vance, who had The flu. I went to first period. Just one class. When I got home, I found my four year old brother, Danny on the kitchen floor, shaking. He's diabetic and his blood sugar was 32. Mom was on the couch scrolling through her phone. Oh, no, she said, not looking up. I completely forgot his insulin schedule. Guess that's just what happens when you choose to be selfish. That afternoon, I tried telling my school counselor. I didn't even finish the sentence before my phone buzzed. Mom's text. Gigi's inhaler seems to be missing. Help me look when you get home. I ran home and found mom holding the inhaler, examining it like she'd never seen one.

But the worst part was what I walked in on that evening. Mom had all the kids who could talk sitting in a circle. Remember? She was saying in her sweet voice, if anyone ever asks, I'm the best mommy ever. Because if you say anything else, they'll take you away and you'll never see each other again. Six year old Gigi was crying. But you're mean to Talia. My name. Mom's face went cold. Old Talia wants to abandon you. I'm the only one keeping this family together. Now what do we say if someone asks? THE children CHORUS in tiny, terrified voices you're the best mommy ever. She made them practice it five more times before bed. I stopped fighting after that. If she wanted me to give it my all, I would do exactly that. I dropped out of school. Not officially. Just stopped going. And when I did show up, I brought the toddlers. These are mine. I told my chemistry teacher when she asked why I was bringing children to learn about the periodic table. I sold her jewelry to buy formula and kept every receipt. I used her credit card at the pharmacy, let them flag it for fraud. When a teenager bought $400 of prescription medications. Two weeks later, she announced she was adopting. Premature twins with serious heart defects need surgery within six months or They won't survive, she said at dinner, like she was discussing the weather. The adoption agency needs proof of a full time caregiver. She looked right at me. I told them you deferred college. The next morning, she left for a five day charity retreat in the Bahamas. Just left a note on the counter with the twins feeding schedule. One was on a heart monitor that beeped if his oxygen dropped below 90. It dropped every hour. Then Francesca, our three year old, had a seizure in the bathtub while I was trying to cool the babies down. I called 9 1 1 with the baby under each arm. Francesca convulsing on the bathroom floor. The paramedics found me. Saw thing covered in vomit with 14 kids, the twins monitor shrieking. Where are your parents? They asked. I showed them Mom's text from the Bahamas. Handle it. That's what you're for. Don't call again. I'm in a meditation session. The hospital social worker pulled me aside the next day.

You hold your glass with both hands like a toddler. Were you raised in a barn? The couple at the next table was already whispering about us. She continued, this is probably the only nice restaurant you've been to before trapping Jess. You probably ate from dumpsters. I ate here three times a week, but I couldn't say that. She studied my plain T-shirt. Like it was contaminated. Goodwill, Salvation Army. Jess probably had to teach you not to wear sweatpants to restaurants. She dress you every morning, too? My hands started sweating. She said you're nothing without her money. When's the last time you paid for anything? Do you even have a wallet? It got so much worse. She pulled out her phone and started showing Jess pictures of other men. Remember Tom? Harvard Law. Just made partner. Still asks about you. She swiped to another photo. This is Anthony.

That's definitely cheating, his brother said. She's having an affair in your bathroom at 2 a m? Like, if only they'd heard themselves, they would have known it made no sense. But they were all delusional. They assembled what my husband called the intervention team. Both sets of parents, my sister and her husband, my best friend, who he convinced would be helping me. Even our neighbor, who my husband asked to be a witness. We'll catch her in the act, told them with rage in his eyes. And he did catch me doing something, just not what he expected. So that night, during my usual 2 a m. Bathroom session, the entire intervention team burst through the door. You're caught! My husband yelled. But everyone just froze, staring at me in my ridiculous neon green sweatpants, sports bra soaked in sweat, and holding two controllers with a VR headset on my face. Um, can I help you? I asked, pulling the headset up. Where is he? My husband screamed, looking around our empty bathroom. Where's who? I said, suddenly realizing what this looked like. Your lover, The person you're meeting in here every night, he pulled out his phone with all the recordings. Listen to this. He played the audio of me screaming about coming. And everyone went,

I wasn't sure if I should be angry or amused that she finally felt exactly how I did all those times she left me to deal with trauma alone. But I didn't have time to think about it. Within minutes, there was a loud pounding on my door with a female voice yelling through the door. I brought wine. Kathy stood there with a red nose and a mascara streaking down her cheeks. She had a wine bottle in one hand and an overnight bag in the other. Before I could say anything, she pushed past and headed straight for my couch like she done a hundred times before. Except this time was different. This time, I wasn't dropping my plans for her. God, I can't believe he did this to me, she said, already pulling up Netflix on my TV. We're watching that show we used to love of, and you're gonna tell me I'm better off without him? I went back to my room and grabbed my duffel bag with my gear while she ranted about the guy she loved so much she ditched Me 47 times. My friends pulled up to the driveway and honked the horn twice. I open the front door and started lacing up my shoes when Mara turned to look at me with a confused expression. Where are you going? Utah rock climbing, I said calmly. She jumped up from the couch so fast she almost knocked over the wine. What? You can't leave! I'm literally having a crisis right now. Then she actually started unpacking my duffel bag, throwing clothes and gear I had neatly packed across the room. Cancel it!

You recorded me without permission. You were planning fraud and you're worried about privacy. Then she said the line that will haunt me forever. Even if the baby isn't biologically yours, you're still going to be his father, like it or not. We're getting married in two months. I'm not letting you ruin our family over some stupid technicality. A technicality? She called paternity fraud a technicality. There's not going to be a wedding, Britney. She lost it screaming in the restaurant about how I was abandoning my responsibility. Other customers stared. The manager came over. You think you're so smart, she hissed. Good luck finding someone else who will put Up with your boring ass. Just a blue collar worker with a truck payment. I walked out while she was still screaming, drove straight to the wedding venue and canceled everything. Lost the 2,500 dollar deposit, but it felt like the best money I'd ever spent.

We moved to this quiet suburb specifically because Emma needed stability after years of failed treatments and school bullying. Our neighbour Karen started her campaign against us immediately. That dog barks. She complained on day one. Buddy had whimpered once, his alert signal that Emma was distressed. I explained about Emma's autism, how Buddy was literally her voice. Karen's response well, maybe she belongs in a special facility then. I installed cameras after that comment. Good thing I did. Emma loves routine. Every morning at 7 a. M. She and Buddy do Rainbow time in our backyard. She arranges colored toys and patterns while Buddy sits guard. It's her therapy, recommended by three different specialists. Violent, peaceful, bothering nobody. Last Tuesday I was inside making Emma's specific breakfast. She only eats yellow foods on Tuesdays when Buddy started his alert bark. Not aggressive. Three short barks, meaning Emma needs help now. I rushed outside to find Karen in our yard, having climbed our fence trying to document the neglect with her phone. Emma was in full meltdown mode.

My neighbour Paula kept telling me how lucky I was to find such a nice young man. Then the packages started coming. At first it was just one or two a day, which seemed normal. But by the third week, the mailman was dropping off like 15 packages every single day. Put names on every single box. David Williams, Jennifer Moore, Carlos Valdes. Names I've never heard before. When I asked Jeremy about all the packages, he just laughed and said he ran an online business selling stuff on eBay. Said he bought things in bulk and resold them. That's why there were so many different supplier names. Made sense to me. Lots of people do that these days. But then strangers started showing up at my door. This lady knocked on Tuesday asking if someone named Nicole lived here. Thursday, it was some guy looking for Rick. Friday, another woman asked about Janelle. I kept telling them nobody by those names lived here, but they insisted they had the right address. My kids started getting scared because people were knocking at all hours. My eight year old daughter asked me why so many angry people kept coming to our house. I didn't know what to tell her. One Night around midnight, I woke up to flashing red and blue lights outside my bedroom window. There were, like, six police cars in my driveway. My heart nearly stopped because I thought something happened to one of my kids. Two officers knocked on my door and asked if they could search the premises. They had a warrant. Turns out Jeremy had

After my husband died, I was stuck with this huge house and three kids to feed. I've been trying to rent out the upstairs for, like, six months. Nobody wanted it because the rent was pretty high, but I really needed that money. I was getting desperate. Like, eating ramen for dinner every night desperate. Then Jeremy showed up to my open house. It was like the perfect renter from a movie or something. He came with this thick folder of paperwork. Credit score over 800, clean background check, references from his church pastor, and two different jobs. He even brought homemade chocolate chip cookies for my kids with. Totally melted my heart because my husband used to do stuff like that. The guy was so polite. Called me ma'am, complimented how clean I kept the place. Said he just wanted a quiet spot to live while he saved up for his own house. When I told him the rent was 12 a month, he didn't even flinch. Just smiled and said that sounded fair. Then he did something that made me think I'd hit the lottery. He pulled out an envelope full of cash and paid 6 months up front, $7,200. Just like that. Said he preferred paying in advance to avoid any hassles. I tried to play it cool, but inside I was jumping up and down. That money meant I could finally catch Up on my mortgage and buy groceries without counting every dollar. For the first two weeks, Jeremy was like the dream tenant. He was super quiet upstairs, always waved at the neighbors when he left for work in his clean Honda Civic. He take out the trash without me asking, and even fixed my squeaky front door.

Six months ago, my wife Kathy left me and our 14 year old daughter for my business partner, Leon. We've been married 16 years, together for 19. I found out through texts on her phone they've been having an affair for three years while Leon and I built our company together from nothing. When I confronted her, she didn't even deny it. Just said she was sick of hiding and wanted to leave. I was devastated, completely blindsided. I begged her to work things out, told her we could go to counseling, anything. She got annoyed and dropped the nuclear bomb. She only married me because she got pregnant and didn't want to be alone. She tried to love me for 16 years, but it never worked. Now she found someone she actually loved and wasn't going to let me hold her back. She filed for divorce immediately. Didn't want alimony, didn't fight for the house, just wanted a fair split of assets so she could get out fast. Leon apologized profusely, said he'd wanted to tell me, but didn't know how. Within weeks, he sold his shares back to me and they moved to Boston for Kathy's new high paying job opportunity. My daughter was absolutely heartbroken. Mom just abandoned her without looking back. For six months, complete radio silence. No birthday calls, no weekend visits, nothing. Despite Having partial custody rights, my daughter refused to even mention her mom's name. We were slowly healing, building our life back together. Then last Tuesday night, 11 p M, someone's frantically pounding our door like the house was on fire. Through the people. Kathy, my daughter, immediately begged me not to answer. Said she didn't want to see her. But I thought it must be some kind of emergency.

Bradley got everyone VIP tables for his birthday, she said, scrolling through his Instagram. He just knows how to make things special. And look at his new promotion post. Youngest VP in his company's history. The second we walked through the door, she immediately started her routine. See how Bradley's already bought everyone around? She said, roughly adjusting my collar. That's called generosity. He makes six figures and still remembers his friends. I watched her as she made her way to Bradley. He was the former college quarterback, now investment VP, and still looked like he stepped out out of the cover of Vogue. You look like you need this more than me, said a voice beside me. A brunette in a black dress held out a whiskey. Marilyn from Bradley's office, someone I'd only met once, at his promotion dinner. I'm more of a wine person anyway, thanks, I said, taking the drink. Bradley's parties are always overwhelming, she said, settling into her chair like she planned to stay. All that aggressive networking disguised as fun. She turned toward me. You're the teacher, right? Yeah, I teach middle school. God, that's brave. Seventh graders are feral. She laughed, moving her chair closer. I bet you have the best stories, though. We started talking about my students while Bradley held court across the bar. Real interest, asking about lesson plans and classroom management. She actually listened to the answers.

It was the morning of my 35th birthday. I was putting on makeup for my party that night when my husband David walked into our bedroom. We should start flirting with other people, he announced. My makeup brush fell right out of my hand. What? He explained. Flirting with others keeps you young. It's for marriages. He said it casually, like suggesting a new restaurant. You're telling me this on my birthday? I couldn't believe it. You're 35 now. Women need to work harder to stay young at that age. That stung. Then came the kicker. My coworker Veronica does this with her husband. They're really happy. This was the third time this week he'd mentioned her. Monday was how smart she was. Wednesday was her promotion. I asked, so we can both flirt with anyone? His face brightened. Yes, perfectly healthy. The excitement in his voice was obvious. That sounds fun. If flirting keeps us young, let's do it. He practically glowed with relief and left the room smiling. He thought I'd sit home while he had his fun. He had no idea what was about to happen. That night at my birthday party, I watched David corner Veronica immediately. She wore a black dress cut low, and he couldn't keep his hands off her arm. They whispered and giggled while everyone watched. My sister looked ready to say something, but I beat her to it. I Walked over to David's best friend, Carl. Carl, you look incredibly handsome tonight. I touched his chest. Carl's face went red. Um, thanks, I continued. David says flirting keeps you young. Do I look young to you, Carl? Poor Carl look terrified. David rushed over immediately. What are you doing? He said quietly. Flirting, like you told me to. Carl heard everything. You told her to flirt with other people? He asked David. Words spread through the party.

I had found a new apartment in a building she'd always dreamed about living in. I slowly moved my important things out. I changed the lease to remove her name, since I've been paying the full rent anyway. I installed a ring doorbell and connected it to only my phone. I changed the locks and packed all her things into boxes and moved them to a storage unit. She came home drunk out of her mind, and left in the morning for work hungover. She didn't notice anything had changed. At 8:45, I was at my new apartment. She texted around lunch about dinner plans, said I was busy. She said she'd see me at home. But the cruel reality hit her when she got home at 7. She called me, but I didn't pick up. She texted me that her key wasn't working. I wonder why. Then she tried the doorbell, but it didn't recognize her anymore. By 7:15, the building manager told her she wasn't on the lease anymore. She was panicking. Now what the hell did you do? She screamed when I finally answered. I graduated from being practice. I said calmly, what are you talking about? Let me in right now! No, I Heard what you said to your co workers yesterday. You called me your practice boyfriend. Training wheels before the real thing, remember? She went silent. Then she said you were there. Another pause. Jordan, that was just jokes with my friends. Which part was the joke? When you said you were trading up soon? Or when you touched Patrick's arm and told him very soon? I could hear her.

Healthy boundaries, she kept saying, showing me some article about teenage sleep schedule she'd found on Facebook. That first night without talking to Nadine was torture. I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, wondering if she thought I was ignoring her, if she was upset, if she think I didn't care anymore. My parents did three separate checks that night, opening my door to make sure I was in bed, sleep device less, and alone. The second night, I couldn't handle it. Nadine had texted me 17 times during school asking if I was okay if we were breaking up. Then I got an idea. I remembered my iPhone 6 buried in my clock.

She talked about family traditions I'd never gotten to experience, birthdays they'd missed, and how she'd set aside money for my college that my adoptive parents had stolen.

He's good practice for when someone worth keeping comes along. They laughed. I just listened from behind the corner. The next morning, she was evicted. My girlfriend Samantha and I had been together for two years, living together for eight months. Problem was Patrick, her coworker, who she called her type. I honestly tried to ignore that. But after we moved in together, her respect shrank while her ego grew. It was the constant comparisons to Patrick at dinner. The way she'd angle her phone away when he texted. The way she'd mention how Patrick dressed, how Patrick talked, how Patrick was going places. It bothered me, but not enough to leave. Until what happened. Three months ago, she was at her company's happy hour. She didn't know I was picking her up early for our week can trip. I arrived at her office building at 5:30 and headed to the bar next door, where they always went. I heard her before I saw her. She was surrounded by six co workers. Patrick Fountain Center. How long have you and Jordan been together? Some woman asked. Samantha laughed. Two years of training wheels. He's good practice for when someone worth keeping comes along. That's cold, someone said, but they were laughing. Not cold. Strategic. Samantha continued, you need a starter boyfriend to figure out what you actually want. He's like the tutorial level. Before the real game begins, Patrick leaned in. When does the real game start? Soon, she said, touching his arm. Very soon. I'm just waiting for the right moment to trade up. I didn't feel angry. I didn't make a scene. I just received clarity. I wasn't even the backup plan. I was practice.

I paid for treating me like an outsider the entire time. So when it came time to settle the bills, I left her with a surprise that had her scrambling. I'm 34, married to Andrea for eight years. We both have good jobs and love travel. Traveling? Andrea's sister Valerie always complained about never affording vacations since her divorce. Three kids, tight budget. You know the story. So when we planned our Miami trip with Andrea's parents, Valerie practically begged to join. I haven't had a real vacation in five years, she he said, eyes watering. I felt bad and offered to cover everything. Flights, hotels, food, the works. Cost me nearly eight grand. But family's family, right? Wrong. The moment we landed, Valerie started her campaign to erase me from existence. First day at the beach resort, she wants a family photo. Seems innocent enough until she turns to me and says, can you take the picture? We want just the four of us. Mom, dad, Andrea and me. I'm standing there confused while she hands me the camera like I'm the hired help. I thought it was a one time thing. Nope. It became Valerie's signature move. For the entire trip, at every scenic spot, every restaurant, every activity, it was the same script. Just family for this one. Or can you get a shot of the original four? Meanwhile, I'm playing photographer on my Own vacation while she posts Instagram stories, making it look like I never existed. Andrea tried defending me multiple times. He is family, she'd say. Even her parents would invite me in. But Valerie always had an excuse. Ready? The lighting's better with four. Or we need someone to capture the moment. Day three, we go on a boat tour.

Growing up wealthy, I never let anyone forget where I stood. Every time someone asked for a loan, every time a friend suggested I pay for dinner, every time a girlfriend lingered too long at the jewelry store window, I had my guard up. My parents would tell me to stop being so cynical, but I just shrug and remind them about Vanessa, the last girl who sued me for a fake engagement ring. When I was 28, my dad threw me in for a whirlwind. We were at the country club when he announced he'd arranged my marriage to Christina, the niece of his new business partner. Mom clasped her hands together, excitement brightening her face. She's lovely. She's an elementary school teacher and comes from a very traditional family. Dad nodded. The merger depends on this union. I met Christina two weeks later. Beautiful, yes. But from a family that lived in a two bedroom apartment. Christina wore the same dress to three different meetings. Her phone screen was cracked. She took public transportation. Every alarm bell in my head went off. Even worse, the wedding happened fast. We prepped for three months, and she refused every expensive option. The simple flowers are prettier, she'd say. I don't need a designer dress. I assumed she was playing the long game. I had to give her Credit. It was a smart move. Act humble until the papers were signed. After the honeymoon, I started my tests. I left my Amex black card on the kitchen counter for a week, but it went untouched, so I suggested we go shopping for her new wardrobe. I have enough clothes, Christina said, heading to her teaching job at 6 a m. I offered to buy her a car. She said the bus route was convenient and she liked reading during the commute. Two months in, I took things a step further. I brought her to the Cartier store for our anniversary. Pick anything, I said, watching her face carefully.

My classmate Asher insisted that blood was blue until it hit oxygen, while Mr. Inguyen kept explaining deoxygenated blood only looked blue through your skin. It's basic science, Asher. Blood is never blue. It's either bright red or dark red, depending on oxygen levels. Asher shook his head stubbornly. He'd seen diagrams and textbooks showing blue veins and red arteries and refused to believe it was just for illustration. Half the class sided with Asher because they'd grown up thinking the same thing. The other half was just entertained by how frustrated Mr. Nguyen was getting. On Thursday, Mr. Nguyen walked into class with a determined look on his face. He sat his coffee mug down harder than usual and announced he was done arguing about easily provable facts. Asher smirked, thinking he'd won. But then Mr. Nguyen went into the supply closet and came back carrying medical equipment. He had a vacuum chamber, sterile needles and tubes like you see at a blood donation center. The whole class went silent as he set everything up on the demonstration table. Jane raised her hand to ask what he was doing, but he waved her off, saying we'd understand in a minute. Then he pulled pulled out a medical blood bag from a cooler we hadn't noticed before. The bag was full of dark red blood with a label that had been partially scratched off. A few students gasped and Jessica actually got up to move to the back of the room. Nobody had expected him to bring actual human blood to class. This is deoxygenated blood, Mister Inguian announced. As you can see, it's dark red, not blue. Never blue. He connected the bag to the vacuum chamber to demonstrate how blood looked without any air exposure. Even in the vacuum, it stayed dark red. Asher

Frozen solid. My phone started buzzing within 10 minutes. First text from Mom. Honey, our cruise confirmation just disappeared from my email. What happened? The travel agent says it was canceled and they can't find our booking anywhere. I looked around the room at all their faces, still laughing, still making jokes about my dramatic overreaction to the cake incident. Jessica was showing people the video she'd taken, replaying my shocked expression question over and over. I typed back slowly, maybe ask Jessica to pay for it. With her dollar store budget, I'm sure she can cover 15 grand with her wheel missing toy money. Then I picked up my crying daughter, grabbed my keys and for bag, and walked out of my own party while they were still laughing. The next morning, I woke up to six to seven missed calls, 89 text messages, and my phone still buzzing non stop like an angry hornets nest. Jessica, you ruined everything! Do you know how much that cruise meant to mom and dad? They've been planning this for months! Dad, this is be non childish. It was just a stupid cake that cost too much anyway. Call the travel agent and fix this right now or you're no longer my son. Mom, sweetie, please call me back. I think there's been a terrible misunderstanding. you didn't mean to cancel our Family vacation over a little accident? We can buy you a new cake! But my favorite message was from my Uncle Bob. The same one who'd been clapping and cheering during Dad's toast about not wasting money. Hey, any chance you could spot me the money for the cruise instead? I already requested time off work and told my boss I'd be gone. This is really messing up my schedule. I smiled and made Mickey Mouse pancakes for my daughter's actual birthday breakfast.

I was sitting on the couch with voice papers in my lap and boxes beside me. When she stopped yelling, I told her, real calm, yeah, I canceled the cards because you don't need them anymore. That's when she noticed the papers and boxes. I handed her the divorce papers and explained this was her graduation from practice marriage.

She couldn't be kicked out because it was her house, too. I showed her the prenup. You could see her face change as she realized how screwed she was. She signed away any claim to everything.

When Amanda posted about people turning their backs on family, I sent her husband screenshots of her luxury purchases and the stolen money. Amanda called, screaming, how dare you! You went behind mine first! With been months, everything collapsed. Dad's business lost contracts. They sold the house below market value. Amanda's marriage was shaken. Mom finally called to apologize. We laughed when we should have defended Carla. We've paid for it. Amanda showed up weeks later, defeated. You ruined me! You ruined yourself! I just stopped cleaning up after you. That evening, Carla brought me a drawing. A big tree standing tall after a storm, with two figures smiling at the bottom. Looks like we made it through, she said. I framed it and hung it where the melted laptop used to Sit. When my family called to pull me back into their chaos, I didn't answer. Not out of anger, but peace.

Yesterday, she gave them all back. When Heather was 18, she walked into the kitchen carrying an old Adidas shoebox and said, dad, I need to show you something. She set the box on the counter and lifted the lid. Inside were hundreds of napkins, post its index cards. They were every lunch note I'd ever written her. You kept these? I asked. She nodded. Every single one. I'd started writing them when she was 6. The divorce between her mom and I had been final for two months. Her mom got weekends and holidays. I got weekdays. I meant I did all the school stuff. The problem was, I didn't know how to do school stuff. That first Monday of kindergarten, I packed Heather a peanut butter sandwich, apple slices, and a juice box. She came home talking non stop about everyone else's lunch. Catherine's mom made sushi rolls that look like pandas. And Julie's mom cut her sandwich into a butterfly with cookie cutter. And Joyce had a note from her mom in her lunch box that said, I love you to the moon and back, with a drawing of a rocket ship. Did you like your lunch? I asked. It was fine, she said, but I could tell she was envious. That night, after she went to bed, I stared at her lunch bag. I couldn't make sushi. I didn't own cookie cutters. But I could write I Grabbed a napkin and wrote, you're braver than you know. Love, dad. The next morning, I tucked it under her sandwich. When she got home, she ran to hug me and said, I saw the napkin. Ellie asked if my mom wrote it, and I said, no, my dad did. Nobody else's dad writes notes. I love you, dad. So I kept writing them. At first they were simple. Have a great day, or, you're my favorite person. Then I started adding drawings. Terrible ones. A cat that looked like a potato. A son with sunglasses. Our dog if our dog was made of circles. My first grade, I was writing jokes. What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear. Told me her table laughed so hard, the lunch monitor had to shush them. Second grade, I started writing them based on what was happening before her spelling test. You got this. Those words don't stand a chance. After she'd fought with her friend. Being kind when you're hurt is the hardest kind of brave. Sit down, Heather said that morning in the kitchen. I need to show you how I organized them. She'd separated them into sections with rubber bands and labeled sticky notes. The first bundle said, funny. She pulled one from third grade. Why don't eggs tell jokes? Cracker. Another one had a drawing of me attempting to dance at her recital. This is still the worst drawing you've ever done, she said. Laughing. The next section was labeled Bad Days. These were thicker napkins, longer notes. She pulled one from seventh grade. You are exactly who you're supposed to be. Not who they say you are. Not who you think you should be. Who you are. That hey, Ruth had told everyone I was weird for not having a mom at home. That I was probably weird, too. How did you know? She said that I hadn't known. I just wrote what I wished someone would tell me. She pulled out another bundle. This one made my chest tight. The label said, saved me. This section is from eighth grade. Mostly. She said she pulled out a coffee stained napkin. You're not alone. You never have been. You never will be. Even when I'm not there, I'm there. She showed me another one from that year.

She could come back when she had a real plan. She ran to her room crying and my husband came in asking what all the yelling was about. When I explained, he said maybe I was being too harsh. Emma's always been a homebody and maybe forcing her out wasn't the answer. But I stood my ground. The next day, Emma's grandmother called me screaming. Emma had called her crying about how I was kicking her out for wanting to be a traditional wife. My mother in law went on this whole rant about how back in her day women didn't need careers and how I was being a terrible feminist mother for not supporting my daughter's choices. Then Emma's best friend's mom texted me saying I was wrong for not respecting my daughter's dreams. Apparently Emma had been telling everyone I was forcing her to abandon her values and become some kind of career obsessed woman who doesn't want kids. But that's not what I said at all. I never said she couldn't be a stay at home mom. I said she needed a backup plan. Some kind of skill or education or work experience. Even just working part time at target would give her basic customer service skills and show her what it's like to earn her own money. The whole thing came to a head last week when Emma announced she joined some online matchmaking group for traditional Wives. She showed me this website where women post profiles talking about how they want to be homemakers, and men look for wives who will stay home. Some of these women were 18, 19 years old, talking about how they're looking for older men who can financially support them immediately. I told her she was basically looking for someone to take care of her like a child, not a partner. That set her off again. She screamed that I didn't understand her generation, that I was stuck in some second wave feminist mindset, and that plenty of women choose to be traditional wives. My husband finally stepped in and said we needed family counseling. Emma refused. She said she'd rather move out than listen to some therapist tell her that her dreams were wrong. So I told her, fine, start packing. She's been staying with her grandmother for the past week.

My daughter Emma just turned 18 and graduated high school two months ago. Since she was about 15, she's been talking about how she doesn't wanna go to college or get a job. She wants to find a husband and be a stay at home mom, period. That's it. That's her entire life plan. At first I thought it was just teenage talk, like how kids say they want to be astronauts or YouTube stars. But she's been dead serious about it for three years now. No college applications, no job hunting, nothing. She spends most of her time watching these TikTok videos about traditional wives and reading blogs about homemaking. Last month she came to me with what she called her life plan. She was going to live at home with me and my husband until she found a husband. She figured she'd meet someone at church or maybe through friends, marry them within a year or two, then have kids right away. When I asked what she'd do if something happened to her hypothetical husband, she just shrugged and said she'd move back in with us. I lost it. I told her that wasn't happening. If she wanted to live at home after graduation, she needed to either get a job or go to school. Community college, trade school, something she didn't have to get a four year degree. But she needed some kind of plan that didn't involve sitting around waiting for Prince Charming. She started crying and said I was being mean and that being a mom was a real job. I told her I wasn't saying being a mom wasn't work, but what happens if her husband dies or leaves or gets disabled? What if they can't have kids? What if he turns out to be abusive? She needed something to fall back on. That's when she dropped the bomb. She said her backup plan was literally me and my husband. If anything went wrong, she just moved back home and we'd support her and any kids she might have. I asked what would happen if we died or couldn't help anymore, and she said, I don't know, mom. This is ridiculous. None of it is going to happen. I told her she was being naive and that I wouldn't enable this fantasy. I said if she graduated and didn't have a job or wasn't in school.

I had just been served divorce papers during my lunch break by someone named Sophia, citing abandonment after five years of marriage. The problem was that I had never been married and had definitely never met anyone named Sophia in my entire life. Maybe it's a different Ryan, my coworker suggested as he studied them more carefully. But then his expression changed. This has your Social Security number and your address and your parents names as in laws. I stared at the signature on the marriage certificate attachment, and my blood ran cold because it looked exactly like my handwriting, down to the way I always make my R's too narrow. This has to be identity theft, I said, but my voice sounded shaky. I dialed the law office with trembling hands, trying to explain that someone was impersonating me. The attorney listened patiently before responding, Mister Ryan, I understand this is emotional, but denying your marriage won't make this simpler. And we have extensive documentation, including wedding photos and joint tax returns. I tried to process that they supposedly had wedding photos of me that I'd never seen. Where are you claiming this marriage took place? I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. Vegas, five years ago. You've been living together in the marital home ever since, though apparently you haven't been there for the past two years, she replied. But five years ago, I was living alone in my current apartment. And I had the least to prove it. There must be some mistake. I've never even been to Vegas. I insisted the attorney side. Mister Ryan, your wife has photo albums and five years of documentation. Perhaps you should review the materials I'm sending before making

Her key scraped the lock, then hit the dead bolt. Banging started. Leo let me in. The door stuck. I didn't move. Just watch them on the doorbell camera. Eric trying to shoulder the door like some tough guy and bouncing off like an idiot. Finally, she called my phone. Leo, what's wrong with the door? Nothing's wrong with it. It's locked. Well, unlock it. No. Silence. What do you mean, no? I mean you don't live here anymore, Maya. You found someone way better, so you can go live with him. Your bags are packed. Have a nice life. I could hear Eric yelling in the background. She started sputtering about how I was breaking up with her over a joke. You broke up with us? When you lied to my face and brought him to the concert. I said the rest was just you confirming my decision in front of a few thousand people. I hung up and blocked both numbers. Eventually, they gave up, and I watched them go on the camera, dragging her luggage down the hallway. The next morning, I moved everything to the building's hallway and sent an anonymous text. Your things are in the hall. Six months later, I haven't heard from her since their relationship imploded. Within weeks. Turns out their whole dynamic was based on him being the exciting alternative to me. Once I was gone, they had nothing to rebel against. Maya had to move back with her parents without me funding her lifestyle. Eric became the local joke after getting knocked out defending his girl. I saw her recently working as a waitress. When I was on a date, she turned white and immediately left her shift.

Three days after Grandpa died, my parents arrived at my door with flowers and a business proposal. They wanted guardianship of my unborn baby. Turns out Grandpa had left behind a trust fund that paid $100,000 a year to whoever raised his great grandchildren. My parents were claiming if I gave guardianship to them, we could all have access to it. It's a win win. They smiled sweetly. They left after I told them I needed time to think. They waited exact three days before going nuclear. I was making breakfast when mom called, crying. The cancer is back at stage 4. Treatment is $80,000 a year, and insurance won't cover it. Two hours later, Annika showed up at my house. She snuck in using the spare key and put her hands on my belly. Before I could react, I had to go through seven years of pain. She whispered, her fingers spreading across my skin like she was claiming territory. Seven years of needles and failure and empty cribs. She swore that with a trust fund, she would give my baby everything I was stressed about private schools, funds, a big backyard to play in. The baby kicked, and I wondered if I was being selfish by keeping her. When you've been trained since birth to put family first, setting boundaries feels like a trail. The breaking point came when mom sent a photo of herself in A hospital bed with an IV in her arm. Starting chemo tomorrow. The caption read. I wish I could afford the treatment that actually works. I arrived to granddad's funeral three weeks later with guardianship papers tucked in my purse. But as the last hymn ended and the funeral director cleared his throat, everything changed. He announced that our grandfather had left specific instructions for this moment. Suddenly, the screen behind the casket came to life, and there was a recording of Grandpa propped up in his hospital bed and staring directly at the camera. If my daughter Evelyn

My older sister Jessica basically raised us three kids because our mom was never around. She'd make our lunches, sign our permission slips. Even bought my brother Mason his Epipens with her waitressing money. Well, last Saturday, I was babysitting Mason when it happened. We were at the park and some kid shared his granola bar. Mason was six bites in when his face started swelling. Where's your Epipen? I asked. Already checking his backpack. His eyes went wide with panic. Jessica has it. She said she'd bring it. My stomach dropped. Jessica was supposed to meet us at noon. It was 12:17. I called her immediately. Restaurant noise and laughter filled the phone. This better be important. Mason's having a reaction. Where are you with his Epipen? I'm on a date. Finally, after three years. Jessica. He ate peanuts. Throat is closing. Are you kidding me right now? You're supposed to be here with his medication. I'm supposed to be 22 and having a life. This is the first time James could get reservations at this place. He needs his Epipen now. I've been raising you kids since I was sixteen. 16. This is literally the only afternoon I've had to myself in months. Jessica, please. No, you know what? I'm tired of this. Every time I try to be happy, something happens. Every single time. At 12:23, Mason collapsed. His lips were blue. A mom at the park, Called 9 1 1 while I held him, feeling his tiny chest barely moving. I called Jessica again. He's unconscious. He's turning blue. Stop being dramatic.

She was loving it, playing to them, living her main character moment. Then she looked down at me. Since Eric's a few inches taller, she was really looking down. She laughed this loud, ugly sound that cut right through me. See? She shouted, making sure everyone around could hear. You're taller. Way better than my boyfriend. The crowd roared their approval. Eric just stared at me with that same smug, punchable face. He'd won. That's when everything went quiet for me. The music, the crowd. Everything just faded. It was this cold, hard clarity hitting me like a freight train. This was it. The final line. I didn't get angry. I didn't yell. I just looked up at this girl I thought I loved. Making a fool of me on another man's shoulders in front of thousands of people. And I smiled because I was done. I turned and walked away. The crowd parted like they could feel the energy coming off me. I didn't look back once I walked out of that venue into the cool Night air and felt nothing but relief. The taxi ride home was the best 45 minutes I'd had in months. My head was completely clear for the first time in ages. I got back to my apartment, my name on the lease, my furniture, and shot the deadbolt. Then I packed every single thing she owned, used her expensive luggage, did it proper.

By Thursday, he'd already spent two hundred dollars on delivery, while my sixty dollar grocery haul was still feeding me perfectly. That looks amazing. What is that? He asked, staring at my dinner. Chicken and vegetables. It only cost me three dollars to make, I said. Must be nice to know how to cook, he said while placing another forty dollar dinner order, including delivery fees and tip. I watched his side of the fridge stay completely empty except for energy drinks, while mine was organized with prepped meals and fresh ingredients. How much have you spent on food this week? I asked. I don't even want to look at my credit card statement right now, he admitted, while his phone showed another declined payment notification. The second week, Travis's side of the fridge remained completely empty except for a single jar of pickle juice with no actual pickles in it. Why aren't you buying groceries? I asked while unpacking my weekly haul. Grocery stores stress me out. I don't know what to buy that doesn't need cooking, he admitted. Friday night I came home to find him trying to cook spaghetti Eddie by putting dry pasta in a bowl with cold tap water and microwaving it for 15 minutes. The pasta had started smoking and set off the fire alarm. Travis, what the hell are You doing? I asked, while fanning smoke out the window. The box says cook for eight minutes in water, so I put it in water and set the microwave for eight minutes. It was still crunchy, so I added more time, he explained.

I showed her everything. She just stare at the hotel receipt from their weekend. The same weekend her mother had been in the hospital for surgery. He used my mother's cancer for a fair time, she said, voice flat. Sunday evening, my wife came home from her weekend with her sister. Kissed me hello. Said she missed me. Asked if I wanted to order Thai food. I hit record on my phone, per lawyer's advice. How's your sister? I asked. Good. We had fun shopping. That's nice. Where'd you stay? She named a hotel the wrong one. She couldn't even keep her lies straight. Funny, because the Marriott Downtown says you stayed there with Mark. Her face went white, then red. Then came tears and denials. Then partial confession. Just one kiss at a bar months ago. She swore. Nothing more. I laughed. Actually laughed. Eight months, Rebecca. I've seen everything. The photos you sent him. The I love you messages. The plans to leave me after my parents Anniversary. Because you didn't want to ruin my grief, period. She tried everything. Blamed me for working too much. Said I'd grown distant after my parents died. Then when nothing worked, she went nuclear. You have no family left. I'm all you have. You'll be completely alone. She knew exactly where to strike. My parents died in a car accident two years ago. No siblings. She'd been my only family. Better alone.

Also, you're not infertile. You're on birth control. The pills are in your medicine cabinet, behind the vitamins. The funeral home erupted. Now, Grandpa's voice continued calmly, my granddaughter, if you're holding guardianship papers right now, and I know you are, because you always want the best for everyone, read page 4, subsection C, out loud. My hands trembled as I flipped through the pages. Permanent and a reversible transfer of parental rights. The guardianship was never meant to be permanent. Your mother's friend drafted those. Stand up, Joe. A man in the fifth row reluctantly stood, face bright red. Mom was freaking. Turn this off! He's destroying our family! Evelyn, you're about to say I was always manipulative. Three, two, one. He was always manipulative, she screamed. Too predictable. Oh, and sweetheart, his voice softened, addressing me. Check under that pregnancy book I gave you. There was a USB. And in seconds, a recording of my mother's voice filled the funeral home. When dad dies, let's tell Opie the cancer's back. She always caves when I cry. And here's the kicker. Grandpa's video continued over the chaos. The trust can only be accessed by biological parents. Guardianship changes nothing. You exposed yourselves for money you could never touch. The funeral home turned in to a battlefield. Family members screaming, mom lunging for the screen, the funeral director calling security. I stood there ripping those guardianship papers into pieces. One more thing. Grandpa's voice echoed for the last. Time about the trust money. I already put it in a locked account for the baby, accessible only at 18. To the child directly. Oh, and Evelyn, if you're still watching this, your parking meter ran out 20 minutes ago. He kept going. And what he said next made my face drain of color. My mother's face went from angry to terrified. Turn it off! She screamed. She doesn't need to know. And after I found out, I was ready to destroy them in the same way they destroyed me. But worse.

Rebecca called 6 7 times between six PM and midnight. Messages progressed from confused to angry to desperate. She claimed Connor didn't mean it, was just showing off for friends, that I was overreacting to. Typical teenager behavior. I texted back once saying I needed space and would contact her when ready, then blocked her number to avoid the emotional manipulation building in her messages. Monday morning, I contacted my bank and removed Rebecca as joint account holder. Called the mortgage company. Thankfully, my name wasn't on the loan. Rebecca had refinanced in her name only six months before we moved in together. The mortgage was due the first. By the fifth, Rebecca contacted me through a mutual friend with a frantic message explaining she didn't have enough money to cover the mortgage, begging me to reconsider. She claimed she talked to Connor and he was very sorry, wanted to apologize personally. I responded that I appreciated her reaching out, but my decision was final. I'd already put a deposit down on a one bedroom apartment across town. Rebecca's sister called Thursday night saying Rebecca was having panic attacks about potentially losing the house. Tried guilting me about abandoning a single mother and her child. I calmly explained I've been financially supporting them for two years while being treated as an outsider in my own home. Friday evening, Rebecca showed up at my brother's place crying, begging to talk. Against better judgment, I agreed to Speak on the front porch. Rebecca looked like she hadn't slept in days. Admitted she'd been wrong. Undermine my authority with Connor. Gotten too comfortable with our financial arrangement. Offered to add my name to the mortgage. Suggested couples counseling. I listened to everything, then explained the issue wasn't just about chores or Connor's attitude. She created a dynamic where I was expected to provide without receiving respect or having any real say in household decisions. Told her I cared about them both, but couldn't continue being treated like a premium rent paying tenant.

Three days after Grandpa died, my parents arrived at my door with flowers and a business proposal. They wanted guardianship of my unborn baby. Turns out Grandpa had left behind a trust fund that paid $100,000 a year to whoever raised his great grandchildren. My parents were claiming if I gave guardianship to them, we could all have access to it. It's a win win. They smiled sweetly. They left after I told them I needed time to think. They waited exactly three days before going nuclear. I was making breakfast when mom called, crying. The cancer is back at stage 4. Treatment is $80,000 a year, and insurance won't cover it. Two hours later, Annika showed up at my house. She snuck in using the spare key and put her hands on my belly. Before I could react, I had to go through seven years of pain. She whispered, her fingers spreading across my skin like she was claiming territory. Seven years of needles and failure and empty cribs. She swore that with a trust fund, she would give my baby everything I was stressed about private schools, college funds, a big backyard to play in. The baby kicked, and I wondered if I was being selfish by keeping her. When you've been trained since birth to put family first, setting boundaries feels like a trail. The breaking point came when mom sent a photo of herself. In a hospital bed with an IV in her arm, starting chemo tomorrow. The caption read. I wish I could afford the treatment that actually works. I arrived to granddad's funeral three weeks later with guardian ship papers tucked in my purse. But as the last hymn ended and the funeral director cleared his throat, everything changed. He announced that our grandfather had left specific the constructions for this moment. Suddenly, the screen behind the casket came to life, and there was a recording of Grandpa propped up in his hospital bed and staring directly at the camera. If my daughter Evelyn is perking up right now thinking this is about trust distributions, he said, and Mom's eager face shifted to

I moved out quietly. I'm 38. Been with my girlfriend Rebecca for three years. She has a 15 year old son, Connor, whose biological father moved states away when Connor was eight. The deadbeat sends maybe $200 monthly when he remembers. Rebecca works part time at a dental office making $30,000 while I pull $95,000 as a project manager. When we moved in together two years ago, I took over her 2 thousand two hundred dollar mortgage payments, plus utilities, groceries and Connor's expenses. Phone, clothes, sports equipment, everything. Rebecca insisted we keep separate finances, which I stupidly agreed to. Looking back, this arrangement only benefited her while I shouldered the financial burden. Connor and I had what I thought was a decent relationship. I never tried replacing his father, but expected base, take respect and help with household chores. Taking out trash, keeping his room clean, weekend yard work. Nothing unreasonable. Rebecca constantly undermined me, saying I was too strict or Connor needed time to adjust. Red flag I ignored. Last Saturday, I was in the kitchen making lunch when Connor's three friends came over. They were hanging out in the living room and Connor was complaining loudly about raking leaves that morning. Our house has thin walls and they weren't keeping voices down. One friend asked why Connor had to do chores when his Mom's boyfriend was home. Connor's response hit like a punch to the gut. My real dad would never make me do chores like this loser. This guy thinks he can boss me around just because he pays for stuff. My mom says I don't have to listen to him anyway. His friends laughed. Once said Connor was lucky having someone pay for everything while doing whatever he wanted. Connor agreed, adding that his mom told him I wasn't going anywhere because I was too.

That's when she completely broke down and confessed everything. She'd faked the entire kidnapping. Spent 18 straight hours in that library writing her history paper on post war propaganda during the Cold War. Survived on vending machine coffee and energy drinks. All because she couldn't face failing my class and losing her scholarship. The administration was furious. Suspended her immediately. Talked about pressing charges for filing false reports, wasting police resources. But I asked to see her paper first. Couldn't help my curiosity about what drove a kid to such extremes. What I read blew my mind. 47 pages of brilliant analysis connecting Cold War propaganda techniques to modern social media manipulation. Original research, primary sources. I'd never seen students use arguments so sophisticated. They belonged in graduate school. This girl understood desperation and manipulation better than most political science professors. She'd lived it for one terrifying night. I stared at that paper for hours. Technically, she missed the deadline. School policy was clear, but she demonstrated more understanding of historical context through her actions than most students showed in their writing. The irony was perfect. A paper about propaganda written during an act of propaganda. I gave her an A. Quietly, never announced it. She graduated with honors by half a point, kept her scholarship, never spoke about what happened again.

I teach A P. History at Jefferson High, and my final paper deadline was legendary for being brutal. No extensions, no excuses, no second chances. I'd failed seniors weeks before graduation before. Everyone knew this. This girl, Rebecca, had a 78% average and needed a solid A on the final to graduate with honours. Her scholarship depended on it. When the deadline hit, she wasn't there. Her paper wasn't submitted. Nothing. That morning, Rebecca's mom burst into Principal Wilson's office, sobbing hysterically. Her daughter never came home from tutoring last night. Phone was dead. Location tracker showed nothing for hours. Complete panic mode hit the school. Missing person's report filed within an hour. Police brought dogs. Local news vans started showing up. Teachers were crying in the break room, talking about how sweet Rebecca was. Everyone assumed the worst. Search parties formed, helicopters circled the area. Social media exploded with her picture. The whole town was looking for this girl. Her mom was on the news, begging for her safe return. Even I felt sick, thinking something terrible happened to one of my students. Twenty four hours passed. Nothing. Then suddenly, around six PM, Rebecca was found behind some dumpster at a gas station 20 miles away. She told police this wild story about being grabbed by some random guy who panicked and let her go. But things felt off immediately. Zero injuries on her body, no defensive wounds. Her phone records showed it never actually left the city limits. Most suspicious part was security footage from near her last known location.

My grandmother passed away last year and settling her estate turned into a nightmare thanks to one absolutely ridiculous Bill. She'd been in a nursing home for her final six months, and we thought we'd handled all the paperwork and payments. Then three months after her funeral, I got a Bill in the mail addressed to her estate for eight hundred forty seven dollars and fifty cents from Sunset Manor Care Facility. I figured it was probably some final medical charge we'd missed, so I called to sort it out. The billing department put me on hold for 20 minutes before a woman named Janet came on the line. She very matter of factly explained that the charge was for post residency room cleaning and restoration services. I was confused. What exactly does that mean? Janet cleared her throat and said, well, when residents pass away, we have to thoroughly sanitize and restore their rooms for the next occupant. It's quite an extensive process. I asked for an itemized breakdown, thinking maybe they'd had to replace furniture or something. What I received in the mail two days later made my blood boil. The Bill included charges like Spiritual Cleansing Ceremony, $200, Sage burning and Negative Energy Removal, $150, Medium consultation to ensure peaceful transition, $300 and blessed water room purification, $75. But the most outrageous charge was one hundred twenty two dollars and fifty cents for exorcism services to remove Lingering presence, I called back immediately and asked to speak to a manager.

My siblings and I always joked about how none of us looked anything like our dad. It was just a silly family joke and we all laughed about it. But one day, our youngest sister saw a DNA test kit on sale, and she suggested we finally settle the question of who was really dad's kid. We thought it was funny, so we agreed to do it just for fun. None of us had any doubts or suspicions because we were sure it would just be a laugh. I'm the oldest of four siblings, two boys and two girls. My youngest sister had always been the favourite, and our parents worked hard to give us everything we needed, even when money was tight. We all took the DNA test while laughing the whole time, making dumb bets and teasing each other. Then we sent off the samples and forgot about it for a few weeks until my phone buzzed with the results. I opened the email expecting something funny, maybe even a confirmation that we were all just being dramatic. But my smile disappeared right away. Out of the four of us, only our youngest sister was actually related to our dad. At first, I thought it had to be a mistake. There was no way this could be real. I stared at the screen for a full minute before I even moved. My hands were shaking as I called my siblings Into the room and showed them the results. My brother said it had to be wrong and suggested we take another test. No one argued. We all needed to believe it was a fluke. So we did. We went to a different place for testing and waited nervously, each day dragging longer than the last. That second test felt heavier, like we were waiting for a sentence. When the second results came back the same, we knew our lives had changed forever. We went to our mom, hoping for answer.

The lead partner texts me, the Git hub is empty. Business partner texts, where are the dragon files? Kid texts, I can't access the cloud. Thingy cloud thingy. This is their new tech Genius. Lead partner calls screaming. The investor will be here in an hour. Where is everything? I calmly explained that I removed my code from my personal Git hub. The AWS is my account, so I shut it down. My credit card, my choice. The art belongs to my roommate, who's already deleted everything. But we have pre orders. He screams yeah, in my Paypal, which I'm refunding right now. Lead partner says this is illegal. We're suing. With what company? You never filed the LLC paperwork, remember? Pay

My dad just shakes his head and goes, this one's your DNA, not mine. And honestly, he's not wrong. I finally break the silence and say, so can I talk now? My mom wipes her eyes and said, sweetie, you were never not allowed to. And I say, oh thank god because I have a lot of opinions about the way you season chicken. It tastes like shit. Then she says you were better quiet. So anyway, now I only speak in short bursts around dinner time. Just in case she tries to revoke my voice again. I keep a whiteboard nearby, like emotional insurance.

I was staying over at my friend Tessa's place for a weekend thing. Nothing fancy, just two days of doing absolutely nothing with people who act like putting frozen waffles on a plate is a full meal prep routine. So Saturday rolls around, it's five thirty PM. I haven't eaten since noon. The house smells like someone burned a candle next to a microwave dinner. I figure, okay, we're probably about to eat soon, to be clear, I asked this so politely, like peak non threatening tone. I walk up to Tessa and go, hey, do you know what time dinner is? Not make me dinner, not I'm starving and your house smells like depression. Just a simple question. Civilized, friendly. She freezes, looks at me like I just asked her to twerk on me and to solve world hunger with two spaghetti noodles and a paperclip. Then she says, and I quote, why do you always assume I know things? I blink. What? She's pacing now. Pacing in her socks, clutching a throw pillow, like she's about to monologue about betrayal in a Netflix original. I say, sorry, I just meant, like, are we ordering food? Cooking? Is someone bringing something? Like, just curious. She goes, yeah, well, maybe next time ask the ceiling, because clearly I'm just the girl who always knows stuff. Ma'am, I asked what time the nuggets arrived. You're acting like I forced you into an unpaid therapist position then, because this couldn't possibly stay normal. She flops onto the couch, stares at the ceiling.

I have legitimately heard someone on my team break up with a girl during a game of call of duty on voice chat. He was using open mic and she was like get off that stupid game and take me out to dinner in this horribly entitled voice. After around 10 minutes of him being calm and saying things like it's okay baby, just let me finish this game, I will get punished if I leave and her just not understanding, she issued an ultimatum if you don't turn that game off right now and take me to dinner, I'm leaving. He just typed in chat pause please. Need to break up with my GF and everyone laughed and paused. Dude just went ballistic. This is my apartment. You stay here on my dime. I buy you all your food. I give you money to go shopping. You don't get to issue ultimatums to me when you don't have anything without me. Get out of my apartment! This relationship is over. Then it was lots of her crying and yelling and bringing up all the things he did wrong in the past as if that was going to help. Eventually he just said sorry, the relationship is over, I don't care. Bring a truck and one of those douchebag bar guys you love to fuck so much to get your stuff tomorrow. See if any of Them are willing to clothe, feed house, and fuck you. Everyone on voice chat just went oh! And we were typing everything that was happening to the enemy team. He eventually got her out of the apartment, and boy, did it sound like the guy had a world of pressure off his shoulders. After the game, I friended him. We still talk on steam sometimes. Bro, really? Just paused an online game. Waiters, what's the worst first date you've ever seen? Good looking guy was at the bar talking about a date he had with a girl his best friend was secretly in love with. His friend never made a move because she was into him instead.

A good looking guy was at the bar talking about a date he had with a girl his best friend was secretly in love with. His friend never made a move because she was into him instead, the guy was deep into his story when she walked in, stunning in a little black dress and high heels. They greeted each other with a kiss and took tequila shots together, the banter quickly heating up. Out of nowhere, he whistles at me like I'm a dog and says, Yo man, more shots. Disappointed, I pour them and let him know I'm not a dog. He brushes it off, saying, just keep an eye out, we're gonna get lit. As the night goes on, he gets louder, laughing at his own jokes and talking over the girl. Then he announces he needs to pee on a rock and stumbles to the back. The girl looks mortified, texting furiously. He returns with another guy, not fully drunk but well on his way, and makes an offhand comment before stumbling outside. His friend follows, leaving the girl alone. Five minutes later, the friend returns, says he put Bob in an Uber, and takes the girl to dinner. But thirty minutes later, Bob walks back in sober, apologizes for whistling, and buys us a drink. He admits he played the fool on purpose so his friend could save the day. He's better for her, he said She's not my type. I was both touched and impressed. Fathers. What moment made your life fall apart? I knew something was wrong when my son stopped showing me his artwork. Every day after school, he used to run to me with his drawings, proud of each messy masterpiece. Then suddenly, nothing. At first, I thought maybe he'd lost interest in art. But one day, I was cleaning his room and found them. Dozens of drawings stuffed under his bed. All of them were of the same thing. A little boy with two dads. One cross.

My fiance said, thinking I'd raise another man's child. But she. I'm a 28 year old union electrician making decent money. I've been with Britney for three years. When she got pregnant seven months ago, I proposed the day she told me. Because that's what you do when you're about to be a dad, right? Something felt off from the moment I proposed. She wasn't excited. More like she was doing me a favor by saying yes. But I pushed down those gut feeling. I've been covering everything since she got pregnant. Doctor visits, baby gear, her rent when her nail salon income dropped. Plus her health insurance. Nearly $8,000 so far. Plus the 4,200 dollar engagement ring. She always mentioned this personal trainer, Derek, from her gym, claiming he was just helping with prenatal exercises. Something about how she talked about him always bothered me. Then came the afternoon that changed everything. I got off work early and decided to surprise her with dinner from that expensive sushi place she loved. I let myself in and heard voices from the kitchen. I was about to announce myself when I heard her talking to her sister Ashley. I still can't believe you're actually marrying him. Damien's got great insurance and steady money, but girl, you're really settling. Derek can't provide what this baby need. Britney replied, Damien can. My blood went cold. I Guess Damien's okay, Ashley continued, but you deserve better than some electrician who thinks Applebee's is fine dining. Britney laughed. I care about him enough. And honestly, he's so desperate to play hero that he'll never question anything. He just nods and pays for whatever I want. For 15 minutes, I stood frozen, listening to them plan my future like I was an ATM with legs. How she'd keep seeing Derek after we got married. How Derek didn't even know the baby was his. How they'd already coached Ashley on what to say if I got suspicious. Just when I came home later, she was acting completely normal, showing me baby monitors, talking about honeymoon plans, asking if I was excited about becoming a daddy. I needed evidence. Started recording conversations, since our state allows one party consent. When she left her phone unlocked during a shower, I found months of messages between her and Derek, planning their future together, discussing how they'd manage things after my wedding. She literally called me the bank in one message. But here's the kicker. She'd been lying to Derek, too. She told him she was on the pill and the pregnancy was an accident. This woman was playing everyone. I got a prenatal paternity test through my doctor. The result? Zero percent chance I'm the father. Last night, I took her to Romano's, where we had our first date. She thought I was planning some romantic surprise. Britt, I need to ask you Something straight up. Is there anything about this pregnancy you haven't told me? Pure panic flashed in her eyes before she slipped into innocent girl mode. What do you mean? Babe, I know about Derek. I have the paternity test results. I know the baby isn't mine. She stared at me. Then the fake tears started. Some sob story about it being just. Just one mistake when we were fighting about money. I've seen the messages, I said. I heard you talking to Ashley. The mask came completely off. The crying stopped, placed by a cold look I'd never seen. You went through my phone. You recorded me without permission. You were planning fraud and you're worried about privacy? Then she said the line that will haunt me forever. Even if the baby isn't biologically yours, you're still going to be his father. Like it or not. We're getting married in two months. I'm not letting you ruin our family over some stupid technicality. A tech technicality. She called paternity fraud a technicality. There's not going to be a wedding, Brittany. She lost it screaming in the restaurant about how I was abandoning my responsibility. Other customers stared. The manager came over. You think you're so smart, she hissed. Good. Good luck finding someone else who will put up with your boring ass. Just a blue collar worker with a truck payment. I walked out while she was still screaming, drove straight to the wedding venue and canceled everything. Lost The 2,500 dollar deposit. But it felt like the best money I'd ever spent.

My son loves gaming, and he'd saved up $2,000 from his summer job to build his first gaming PC. I took him to this fancy computer store, mostly for moral support. He'd done months of research and knew exactly what parts he needed. Sales guy took one look at my son's wheelchair and started talking to me instead. Sir, maybe we should look at pre built systems. They're much simpler. My son pulled out his carefully organized parts list, but the guy wouldn't even look at it. These high end components are very complicated, he said, still ignoring my son. Maybe something more basic would be better suited for his situation. My son, who'd been building computers in his head since he was 12, finally had enough. My situation? You mean the fact that I can code in three languages and run my school's tech club? Or that I've built five computers for my friends already? The manager overheard and came over, apologizing profuse, but my son was already Wheeling toward the door. Dad, let's go to Micro Center. I heard they actually hire people who know what they're talking about. Three hours later, my son had all his parts from Micro Center, where the staff treated him like the expert he was.

I teach high school Spanish, and last semester a student named Tyler didn't show up for his oral presentation. Instead, he sent an email with a video attachment claiming he was stuck in Mexico after a family emergency. The video showed him stranded at a Mexican beach, apologizing in Spanish for missing class. Behind him were palm tree, crystal blue water, and a sign that said ply a Cancun. It was actually pretty impressive. He'd even thrown some Mexican coins on the table next to him to sell the story. But there was one problem. I could see his bedroom poster reflected in his sunglasses. Instead of calling him out, I replied with my own video, speaking entirely in Spanish, of course. I congratulated him on finding such a nice beach and mentioned how amazing it was that he'd managed to find the only Cancun beach with a target shopping cart in the background, which was visible in the reflection of his window. I ended by assigning him an extra credit project, a presentation on the difference between Mexican beach is and the local lake where he'd actually filmed the video. He showed up to class the next day with a full Powerpoint comparing them. Now he helps run the Spanish clubs weekly movie nights, where we sometimes watch his travel video for laughs. When he finished, he closed the panel, wiped his hands on his jeans, And said should run fine now. The bearings might need replacing next year, though. That night, my brother in law called to invite us to his son's basketball championship. He couldn't resist adding, bring Avery, too. Maybe he'll finally get interested in something besides books. I smiled into the phone. Actually, Avery's busy rebuilding our washing machine.

I just wanted them to think that I didn't exist. The wedding guests started filing out, whispering and staring. Derek's new wife looked mortified. His in laws were frantically asking questions.

I worked at a memory care facility when I witnessed something that still haunts me. There was this resident, Dorothy, 82 years old, with mid stage alzheimer's. Every day at three PM, she'd wait by the window, convinced her son Bradley was coming to visit. She'd put on lipstick, fix her hair, and clutch this little photo album she kept hidden under her mattress. Bradley hadn't visited in two years, but Dorothy didn't remember that. Every day was the first day of waiting for her. One Tuesday, Bradley actually showed up, not to visit, but with a lawyer and a real estate agent. They needed Dorothy's signature on papers to sell her house. I watched from the hallway as he walked right past the recreation room, where his mother sat in her usual chair, wearing her good dress, photo album in her lap. The administrator called Dorothy to the office. When she saw Bradley, her whole face transformed. You came. I knew you'd come. She reached for him, but he stepped back, gesturing to the lawyer to explain the documents he needed her to sign. Papers she couldn't possibly understand, using medical terminology about her diminished capacity, while she sat there smiling at her son, asking if he'd like some of the cookies she'd saved from lunch. But here's the part that broke me. Dorothy started showing Bradley the photo album. Pictures of him as a baby, at graduation, his wedding, She narrated each photo with perfect clarity. Moments from decades ago preserved while yesterday vanished. This is you at the beach. You. We're scared of the waves. But I held your hand. Bradley wasn't even looking. He was texting on his phone. When she got to a photo of them at Christmas, she started crying. I'm sorry. I can't remember things anymore. I try so hard. Are you disappointed in me? Bradley finally looked up, annoyed, and said, mom, just sign the papers. She signed everything. Seven documents giving Bradley full control of her.

My brother was born when doctors said my mom couldn't have more kids. They called him their miracle baby. I was 7 and suddenly invisible. For my 10th birthday, I asked to go to Dave and Buster's. They took my brother shopping for school clothes instead. Your birthday can wait, mom said. It never got rescheduled. By high school, the pattern was set. He'd break something, blame me, and I'd get grounded. He failed every class, but got a BMW for his 18th birthday. I was valedictorian and got a card. They skipped my graduation because he felt left out and needed a beach day. I stayed home during college to save money, working two jobs while finishing my degree. Every morning, my brother would jingle his BMW keys at me. Still taking the bus. Loser. After six months of overtime shifts, I finally had enough for a down payment. My friend's dad owned a used car dealership and cut me a deal on a blue Dodge Challenger. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. First thing I'd ever owned that my parents hadn't touched. I parked it in the driveway that night, put the keys on my dresser, and took about 50 photos. Even posted one on Instagram with the caption earned, not given. Next morning, the keys were gone. So was the car. So was my brother. He probably just borrowed it, mom said, not looking up from making His favorite breakfast. You know how boys are. He stole my car. Family doesn't steal from family. Three hours later, I heard the engine. My brother pulled up in my challenger. Except the front bumper was dragging, the passenger mirror was gone, and there was a crack. Spider webbing across the windshield. He tossed me the keys. Your car is junk, bro. Fell apart on the highway. You should get your money back. I stared at the damage. You crashed it. Prove it. My parents immediately sided with him. Dad actually said I should apologize.

Pickles hops onto the counter, knocking over a napkin with three more stolen quiches underneath. Silence. Stunned silence. Amber rushes over and inspects the evidence. Then, like a true crime detective, realizing her entire theory just fell apart, she spins around to me and says, okay, but you could have train the cat. What? I nearly burst out laughing. So now I'm a criminal mastermind with a carb loving feline accomplice? Derek actually nods. Honestly, that'd be kind of impressive. At this point, even pickles looks offended.

My girlfriend Maya had this male best friend, Eric, who was always around, always touching her arm, always looking at her like she was his prize. Six months earlier, I'd laid it out clearly. Either put serious distance between you two, or we're done. She cried, promised he was just a friend. And for months, things seemed better. Then came the concert. I busted my ass to get expensive tickets to her favorite band. It was supposed to be our date night. We get through the gates, and the first person I see is Eric, standing there with this smug grin. What's he doing here? I asked, not hiding my irritation. Maya went defensive immediately. Oh, my god, Leo, don't start. He got a ticket from a friend. It's total coincidence. The look Eric gave me, that little victorious smirk, told me everything. This was no coincidence. This was a setup. She lied to me and broken the one promise I'd made. A deal breaker. But I paid for those tickets, so I decided to just ignore them. Stupid plan. Because it's. Maya. And Eric had other ideas. They were all over each other the entire time. Whispering, laughing at inside jokes I wasn't part of. She was putting on a performance. And I was the chump in the background. I wasn't her date. I was just the guy who drove her there. When the headliner came on, the crowd surged forward and Maya started complaining she couldn't see Leo. Let me get on your shoulders, she said, like nothing was wrong. You know I have a bad back. I told hold her, suggesting we move to the side instead. She gave me a five second pout, then turned to Eric with that bright fake smile. Eric will do it. He's strong. Just like that, he's crouching down and she's climbing onto his shoulders. The crowd around us, a bunch of drunk kids, started cheering. She was loving it, playing to them, living her main character moment. And she looked down at me. Since Eric's a few inches taller, she was really looking down. She laughed this loud, ugly sound that cut right through me. See? She shouted, making sure everyone around could hear. You're taller, way better than my boyfriend. The crowd roared their approval. Eric just stared at me with that same mug, punchable face. He'd won. That's when everything went quiet for me. The music, the crowd. Everything just faded. It was this cold, hard clarity hitting me like a freight train. This was it. The final line. I didn't get angry, I didn't yell. I just.

The door stuck. I didn't move. Just watch them on the doorbell camera. Eric trying to shoulder the door like some tough guy and bouncing off like an idiot. Finally, she called my phone. Leo, what's wrong with the door? Nothing's wrong with it. It's locked. I'll unlock it. No! Silence! What do you mean, no? I mean you don't live here anymore, Maya. You found someone way better, so you can go live with him. Your bags are packed. Have a nice life. I could hear Eric yelling in The background. She started sputtering about how I was breaking up with her over a joke. You broke up with us? When you lied to my face and brought him to the concert, I said the rest was just you confirming my decision in front of a few thousand people. I hung up and blocked both numbers. Eventually, they gave up and left. Watch them go on the camera dragging her luggage down the hallway. The next morning, I moved everything to the building's hallway and sent an anonymous text. Your things are in the hall. Six months later, I haven't heard from her since. Their relationship imploded within weeks. their whole dynamic was based on him being the exciting alternative to me. Once I was gone, they had nothing to rebel against. Maya had to move back with her parents without me funding her lifestyle. Eric became the local joke after getting knocked out defending his girl. I saw her recently working as a waitress. When I was on a date, she turned white and immediately left her shift.

Get out before I drag your black ass out, he said, while already opening my door. And keep your hands where I can see them, or things will get real bad real fast. Got out slowly, because I've seen enough videos to know how this goes with cops like him. He immediately started destroying my car like a wild animal looking for food. You people are all the same, he said, while throwing my stuff everywhere, acting innocent. But I know you're dealing or stealing. He actually pulled out a knife and started cutting my seats open looking for hidden substances. Your kind is why I became a cop, to protect real Americans from animals like you. What this racist trash didn't know was that I was actually a federal agent. I've been working undercover for six months investigating him. Fifteen black families had filed complaints saying Owens planted evidence to arrest innocent people. One kid jumped off a bridge after Owens framed him and he lost his full ride to college. Another family became homeless fighting fake charges that Owens laughed about. In the station, I had cameras in my earring, my necklace, and even my shoes, recording everything. The investigation team was watching from A van two blocks away. He was about to find out that his most famous arrest would be the one that destroyed him. Owens grabbed his radio and called for backup. I've got a violent black female. She is acting aggressive and probably armed. I literally hadn't moved or said anything. Three cop cars came flying in with sirens, screaming like I was holding hostages or something. His partner Garrett jumped out already pointing his gun at my face and yelling, is this the substance dealer? They always made stuff up like this. Yeah, she matches the description perfectly. Owens lied. Dark

Mom chose her boyfriend Rufus over me when I was 16. He claimed I stole his Rolex, which was ridiculous since he pawned it weeks earlier for casino money. Rufus gave mom an ultimatum that night. Either she goes or I go. Mom didn't even hesitate. She packed my clothes and trash bags while I was at school and changed the locks. When I got home, my stuff was on the lawn getting soaked by sprinklers. I spent three weeks sleeping in a 24 hour laundromat. The owner eventually caught me, but instead of kicking me out, he offered me a job cleaning his other properties. That's how I met Mister Thief, a 73 year old man who was more powerful than I could have thought. His daughter had died at 17 in a car accident years earlier. When he found me scrubbing his toilets at 2:00am for grocery money, something in his eyes changed with in a month, he moved me into one of his vacant luxury condos. Not some rundown unit, but a penthouse he usually rented for $5,000 a month. Mr. Thys brought me dinner every night, helped with homework, and taught me the property business. When other kids were learning to parallel park, I was learning to negotiate lease agreements and manage construction crews. He paid for my prom dress, my college tuition, even walked me down the aisle at my Wedding for five years. He was the father I never had. When he died of a heart attack, he left me everything. 47 rental properties worth $18 million. I was 21 and suddenly one of the largest property owners in the city. I tried reaching out to mom once during those years. Invited her to my high school graduation. She never showed. Drove by the house one Christmas Eve and saw her through the window laughing with Rufus. I knocked for 10 minutes. She looked right at me through the glass and closed the curtain. Mom's sister called me when I was 25. Said mom and Rufus were begging family members for money again, asking if I had anything to spare. They've hit up everyone. Cousins, co workers, even Rufus's ex wife. I hung up and

So here's what's happening. I'll do all the talking during the presentation because I actually understand the nuances. So I had to deal with this pretentious douchebag for the next week. Great. He pulled out his phone and started scrolling. Your only job is to write down everything I say for the slides. Every single thing. You are too much of an idiot to think. Anyway, now here's the thing. This dumb kid had a habit of pausing his sentences to say nasty things about others. Like he just started dictating about the Cold War, but then paused to say, wait, hold on. Is that Jessica? Damn, she looks incredible today. Look at those tight jeans. I got a brilliant idea. Open Powerpoint and started typing, figuring I should do exactly what he says. So I transcribed everything he said, even that line about Jessica. In fact, for the next week, Marcus would corner me in the library and dictate while doing literally everything else as I transcribed it all into perfectly formatted slides. Monday session. The Marshall Plan represented. Damn, did you see Brian's outfit today? Looks like a highlighter threw up on him. Tuesday, I swear, Samantha Keeps staring at me. She's obviously down bad for me. Wednesday. Honestly, if I have to hear Peterson talk about his fake Yale degree one more time, I'll lose it by Thursday. I had 20 slides filled with all those comments. I. I asked if he wanted to review what was actually on the slides. His nasty ass comments, but he just said why would I need to review my own words? Just make sure they auto advance every 45 seconds.

My dad died believing I was in federal prison. That's what my stepmother Veronica told him during his final week in hospice care. She had convinced the hospice staff I was dangerous and shouldn't be allowed to visit. I found out because a nurse broke protocol and called me after dad died. She said Veronica had been telling him for weeks that I was in prison for fraud and couldn't come see him. The truth was I lived 20 minutes away and had been calling the hospice daily begging to see. Two weeks before he entered hospice, while he was still confused from pain medications, Veronica got him to sign a new will. Everything went to her. The house, his plumbing business, 400,000 in savings. All of it. At the will reading, the lawyer said, everything goes to my wife, Veronica. My son gets nothing because he betrayed my trust. I tried to fight it, but my lawyer said without proof of coercion, I had no case. Cost me 5,000 just to hear that. Within a month, Veronica sold dad's plumbing business for cash. While I was sleeping in my car, she posted photos from Miami with her trainer. While I work double shifts at a warehouse. She bought a seventy thousand dollar Mercedes. While I saved every penny. For three years, she was burning through dad's money on failed boutiques and younger boyfriends. I watched It all on social media. The shopping sprees, the ages, the parties. She went through 100,000 in the first year alone. Meanwhile, I bought my first condemned property for 30,000 using a hard money loan. Spent six months fixing it myself after my warehouse shifts. Kept it for 60. Used the profit to buy two more, started renting them. Year 5, she was selling dad's house to cover debts. Year 7, her latest boyfriend cleaned out her accounts and disappeared. Year 8, she had to take a retail job. By year 10, I own 22 rental properties, bringing in 300,000 annually. She was folding clothes at minimum wage. I built everything from nothing, while she destroyed everything.

He entered the room like he just returned from a battlefield. Hair wind blown, shirt unbuttoned at the top like he'd fought a lion. On the way in, he froze when he saw me and the pizza. The room dropped 10 degrees. His eyes locked on mine like I had just eaten his first born. He goes, you. You ate it? And I, stupidly trying to be friendly, said, oh, yeah, hope that wasn't yours. Which is what we all say. When we absolutely hope it wasn't yours. But already

The clock was ticking. Dad called next, his voice shaking. Vanessa, please. Brooke doesn't know what she's done. She's just trying to impress these people. Impress them with what, dad? The house I bought. Your mother and I, we never meant for it to go this far. But you let it. For six months, you watched Brooke take credit for my sacrifice. Another call came through. Brooke herself, sobbing. Vanessa, I already hired caterers. I sent embossed invitations to the senior partners. They think I own a lakefront estate. You don't own anything, Brooke. I do, but this will ruin my career. These people are expecting elegance and sophistication. Maybe you should have thought about that before uninviting the person who actually owns the house. Beautiful part. Brooke had already booked the catering, hired servers, ordered custom linens. She'd positioned herself as the hostess of this prestigious lakefront estate, probably bragging about her family's success to colleagues for weeks. Now she had 30 days to explain why she was suddenly homeless. Next text was desperate. Vanessa, I'll pay you back. I'll get a loan. With what credit score, Brooke? After you destroyed mom and dad's? I booked my ticket to Bali that afternoon, first class. Naturally. The money I'd saved from not having to support Brooke's lifestyle anymore was finally working for me. The irony was perfect. While Brooke scrambled to find a new venue and salvage her professional reputation, explain meaning to her fancy law firm friends, Why? The lake front house was suddenly unavailable. I'd be watching sunsets over the Indian Ocean. My phone kept buzzing with increasingly frantic family messages, but I was already mentally checked out. Then came the final text from Brooke. Vanessa, they're all asking questions. My boss wants to know why I can't host anymore. What am I supposed to tell them? Tell them the truth.

Look, I love my family, but hosting Thanksgiving for five years straight has turned me into their personal servant. Last year was when I finally snapped. My sister Jen showed up three days early with two suitcases like she was moving in. She immediately claimed my couch, turned on Netflix, and announced she was on vacation mode. My brother Rick brought his twin boys, who are 7 and treat my house like it's Chuck E. Cheese. The first morning, I woke up to find chocolate fingerprints on my white walls and goldfish crackers ground into my carpet. When I asked Rick to clean it up, he just shrugged and said, kids will be kids. Then my mom arrived with a list of everything wrong with my house. The guest towels weren't fluffy enough, the dining room needed better lighting. She even made me drive to three different stores to find the exact cranberry sauce she wanted. But the absolute worst part was the Thanksgiving night. After I spent eight hours cooking a Turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, green bean casserole, and two pies, everyone ate and immediately scattered to the living room. I'm talking dirty plates everywhere, gravy spilled on my good tablecloth, and Turkey bones just left sitting there. My husband Jake and I cleaned for three hours while everyone else watched football and complained that the TV was too quiet. Next morning, Rick's Kids ate the entire leftover pie I was saving for Jake's parents who were coming that weekend. When I got upset, Jen rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic over dessert. That's when I lost it. I told everyone they needed to leave by noon, that I was done hosting. Fast Forward to this year in September. I told them I needed a break and suggested we rotate hosting or go to a restaurant. Mom immediately said my house was the most comfortable and I was being selfish. Jen said her apartment was

She'd laugh, ruffling my hair. But then it got weird. She started saying it more seriously when she had to work late again and missed my school play.

Six months ago, my parents nearly lost their lakefront house because my golden child sister Brooke, racked up massive debts on their credit cards. Who did they call? Me. I liquidated everything.

Brooks really blossomed into such a sophisticated woman. You understand, right? Brooke? The same sister who called me jealous when I asked about the $15,000 she borrowed last year. The same one who maxed out Mom's credit cards on networking trips to Cabo. But they didn't know about the paperwork my lawyer made them sign when they were desperate. The loan agreement with very specific terms they'd forgotten about. I opened my laptop and typed one word in the family chat. Okay. Then I called my attorney, Steven. Start the proceedings. They have 30 days. The next morning, I woke up to 17 missed calls. Brooks hysterical voicemail was The Vanessa? What is this? Eviction notice? This is my Thanksgiving dinner. I already sent invitations. Mom's text came next. Sweetie, surely we can work this out. Brooks worked so hard planning this event. Hard work? That's rich coming from someone who spent the last six months shopping with money she didn't earn.

I'm deaf and lived my whole life thinking my apartment was this peaceful, quiet space. Boy, was I wrong. I'm 24 and got my own place about two years ago. Small, one bedroom, nothing fancy, but it was mine. I loved how calm everything felt. My cat pepper and I had our routines down. I'd make tea every morning, watch Netflix with subtitles, do my thing. But here's the weird part. I could never sleep through the night like ever. I'd fall asleep fine around 11, then wake up at 2:00am sweating and anxious and again at 4, sometimes 5:30. Every single night for months, I check my phone, look around the room, everything seemed normal, but my heart would be racing like I just run a Marathon. My doctor said it was probably anxiety, prescribed me some sleep aids. That didn't do anything. My therapist thought maybe I had some deep childhood trauma, trauma messing with my sleep. We spent weeks talking about my past, but nothing clicked. It didn't feel like nightmares or panic attacks. It felt like something was physically wrong with my space. My cousin Zoe came to visit last month. She's hearing and was gonna crash on my couch for the weekend. She works at this marketing firm downtown and needed a place to stay while her apartment got fumigated. We've been texting about it for weeks. So she shows up Friday night around 8 with her overnight bag and some Chinese takeout. We're eating and catching up, talking about her job, drama and my new position at the graphic design company. Everything's normal. Then around 10, she starts looking around my apartment. Weird. Yeah. How do you sleep here? She asks, making this disgusted face. I'm confused. I signed back asking what she means. My apartment's clean.

I spent three years invisible at my high school. Not the shy kid who sits alone, but the one nobody remembers exists. Teachers called me by the wrong name. Kids borrowed my notes then forgot who gave them. Even the lunch lady skipped my tray sometimes like I wasn't standing there. So when I overheard two popular girls planning the senior prank, something inside me snapped because I wanted to join, but because their idea was weak, they wanted to fill the principal's office with balloons. That's it, balloons. Like we were still in middle school. I knew I could do better, so I started planning something that would make everyone finally see me. First, I got Jake involved. He worked at his uncle's print shop and owed me for doing his chemistry homework all semester. I told him I needed 500 copies of something but couldn't say what yet. He agreed without questions because that's how desperate he was to pass. I talked to Emma from theater. She had keys to the costume room because she managed props. I told her I needed to borrow something for one night. She handed me the keys and said, just don't get caught. The hardest part was getting into the school database. But my computer science teacher, Mr Lopez, had been using the same password for three years, football 2,019. I knew because he typed it in front of us every morning when he Logged in two weeks before graduation. Everything was ready. I stayed after school pretending to work on yearbook layouts. When the building emptied out, I went to work. First, I logged into the announcement system and recorded a new morning message. Then I printed all 500 copies. Every single one was a different embarrassing photo from the principal's Facebook. Him doing carry okay. Him wearing a banana costume at Halloween. Him crying at his daughter's wedding. But that wasn't the best part. Using the theater supplies, I made a perfect replica of our school mascot costume, except this one had the principal's face printed on the head. I hung it from the main hallway ceiling with fishing wire so it would drop during morning announcements. The next morning, I sat in homeroom trying not to smile. At exactly 8:15, my recorded message started playing over the speakers, but it wasn't my voice.

I need a signature for this one, ma'am. Through the doorbell camera, I watched him shift his weight. It'll just take a second, he insisted. That's when I noticed he wasn't holding a scanner. FedEx always has those handheld devices for signatures. This guy's hands were empty, except for my package. Who's it from?

I don't have medical conditions requiring special deliveries, but, I mean, it's just in my head, right? The driver knocked again, harder this time. Ma'am, I can hear you moving around in there. I hadn't made a sound. I was sitting perfectly still on my couch, phone clutched in sweaty hands. How did he know I was home? I tell him he's got the wrong address.

He said he's at a grocery store and is heading over. I called him and said what's going on and please hurry cause I was scared. The man outside started trying the doorknob, gently at first, then with more force. Mark said, I'm calling it in. Stay quiet, hide and lock yourself. He hung up.

My friend's girlfriend venmoed me $200 with a message. Brutally crush her heart for me. I accepted the request. I thought, wow, what a sick joke. About two weeks ago, at my friend's birthday party, his girlfriend Aria cornered me in the kitchen. Need you to date my roommate Amelia for exactly three weeks, then break up with her. She pulled out her phone and showed me a picture of the most gorgeous girl I've ever seen. Dark brown hair and eyes like sapphire. She's been obsessed with an ex who ghosted her six months back. I'm done watching her cry over a guy who doesn't deserve her tears. I'd rather she cry over a guy like you and move on quickly. Plan was simple enough. Make Amelia fall for me, then hurt her in a nicer way. A smaller heartbreak to get over the bigger one. I told her it was cruel, but she'd already written me a script with conversation starters and favorite books. I accepted to get her off my back and for the easy money. It wasn't hard to find her at the bookstore. Amelia sat directly beside the window, the light hitting her gently, highlighting the different hues in her eyes. She looked like a painting from a distance. Became the only girl to ever make me nervous. I walked over and smiled softly. Is this seat taken? She glanced up at me. Her smile Meeting mine clumsily, yes. I mean, no. Please sit. I watched her ears burn red. Cute. I pointed at the book in her hand. Also a fan of Rebecca Yarrow? She giggled. You know this is a romance book for women, right? I shrugged. Yeah, well, I like the dragons. That made her laugh harder, which made me feel relieved. Aria had sent me cliff notes late at night, and I'll be honest, I wasn't very good at memorizing, but I did remember seeing the word dragons. Rest of the book club date went smoothly, to the point where half of the time I wasn't acting, and we ended up staying in the parking lot talking until closing time. When Amelia mentioned her ex and got this sad look. It snapped me back. Right the favor, I thought. Feeling kind of disappointed almost. The second date felt dangerously real. I picked up Amelia from the book club on my motorcycle, putting on a worn leather jacket that had been hidden for months after my dad passed. She got on the bike full of fear and excitement, like kid on a field trip for the first time. Amelia screamed as I took her along the winding roads, and gasped when she saw the spot overlooking the city. They look like stars! She shouted. We both stared out at the twinkling view of the skyline. The sound of crickets around us made it feel like we were in our own world. It's Funny, I said, licking my lips anxiously. I don't usually bring people up here. She raised an eyebrow and jabbed me with her elbow playfully. Oh? And why is that? I shook my head at her tone and took in a deep breath. This is where I came after my dad died. He and I used to go on rides together up here for years. I turned away, fighting back emotions that I hid away carefully to protect myself. Amelia slipped her hand in mind and squeezed hard. It's okay. I'm glad I can share this with you. Noted. We spent another hour staring at the bright lights, talking about our family before heading back. Aria made sure to check in the next day. I don't know what you're doing, but it's working. She's looking happier than ever. Her words didn't make me feel good. It made me nauseous with guilt instead. And it made me think about how I go through with the final date. The night before then, Amelia showed up to my place, saying, I'm sorry if this is going to sound crazy, but I couldn't say it over the phone. I'm in love with you, and I hope you are, too. She stood at my doorway, fidgeting and breathing heavily from her nerves. I had never felt more happy and heartbroken at once. I'm sorry, but I don't feel the same way, I said through my teeth. I tried to close the door, but she stepped Her foot through to stop me. But what about the things before? I shook my head and looked away, doing my best to keep things together. I thought I could handle your baggage, but you're exhausting. My tone felt scripted, but I had no choice. She needed this. Aria had said so. Every time you talk about your ex, I realize you'll never be over them. Amelia looked at me, pain apparent across her face. You know what? You're right. I was too much. Too much for someone who's emotionally vacant. At least my ex had the decency to just disappear. Not this performative. Cruel. I watched her run down the hallway of the apartment, wiping tears from her eyes. I slammed the door closed, regret flushing over me. I didn't deserve her anyway. I tried to convince myself. Three days later, we both showed up at Aria's apartment to return the money. Aria smiled awkwardly. She pointed at us. I paid you guys for the same thing. Look, Aria was hurting over an ex, and you were hurting over your dad. And I thought, hey, what better way to not feel hurt than love, right? We glared at her while she backed into A. Amelia and I stared at each other in silence until she asked quietly, so you don't like dragons? I burst out.

When she first mentioned Marcos, I barely paid attention. Another name and a string of boyfriends who wouldn't last. But then months passed. She kept talking about him. I started to worry. He's coming for dinner next Friday, Lily announced one evening, not asking but telling. My wife squeezed my hand under the table, a silent plea to behave. Fine, I muttered, but I'm grilling steaks my way. Marcos arrived 15 minutes early with a bottle of wine and a firm handshake. Strike one, too eager to impress. Throughout dinner, I watched him carefully, waiting for the mask to slip. He laughed at my jokes, complimented my wife's cooking and asked thoughtful questions about Lily's childhood. Too perfect. Nobody is that genuine. When Lily mentioned her car was making strange noises, I saw my opening. I'll take a look at it tomorrow. I offered. Actually, Marco said, I'm pretty good with cars. My dad owned a garage and I work there every summer through college. Strike 2, trying to one up me in my own house. After dinner, I suggested we move to the porch for drinks. My secret weapon was always the porch, where potential boyfriends inevitably revealed their true selves under my scrutiny. Sir Marcos Said quietly when Lily and my wife were inside.

My Japanese grandmother called me bakachan from the day I was born. I thought it meant little treasure or precious jewel in Japanese. She would pat my head and say bakachan with such warmth in her voice. I felt like the most special grandchild in the world when she said it. In fourth grade, I did a family tree project explaining how bakachan was a sacred Japanese term. It showed how much my grandmother cherished me above all her other grandchildren. My teacher, who I now realise spoke Japanese, kept making strangled noises and spilling her coffee. I thought she was just emotional about my beautiful cultural presentation. I begged my parents for a bakuchon themed birthday party. We had custom napkins printed with Wakachan Sweet 16 in Japanese characters. The Japanese bakery tried to refuse our order three times. They kept suggesting alternatives like birthday girl or literally anything else. Mom had to pay triple to convince them. For my 18th birthday, I got bakuchan tattooed on my wrist in beautiful Japanese characters. The tattoo artist, clearly Japanese, made me sign five different waivers. He kept muttering in Japanese and showing me pictures of butterflies and cherry blossoms instead. I insisted on bakuchan because I wanted authenticity. He took photos of the consent forms while shaking his head. My college application essay is centered around being called bakuchan and it meant to me I Wrote about how this precious nickname connected me to my Japanese heritage. I explained how it represented unconditional love and acceptance in Japanese culture. I got into several schools and was convinced my touching essay made the difference. Freshman year, I decorated my dorm room with a giant neon sign saying Baku Chan's Palace in Japanese. My Korean roommate took one look and immediately requested a room transfer. When I explained the beautiful meaning, she just patted my shoulder sadly and doubled her transfer request. I assumed she was intimidated by my cultural authenticity. I joined the Asian Student Union and introduced myself as bakachan. At every event, the Japanese exchange students would freeze and then whisper frantically to each other. One girl actually laughed out loud before her friend elbowed her hard. they were impressed by how connected I was to Japanese traditions. My boyfriend got property of bakachan printed on a hoodie for Valentine's Day. His Japanese roommate saw it and laughed so hard he needed his inhaler. When my boyfriend wore it to the International Student Mixer, the entire Japanese Student Association took group photos with him. I thought they were admiring our cross cultural romance. Junior year, I finally got to study abroad in Tokyo. At customs, I proudly declared Watashi wabakachandeisu. The officer dropped his stamp and called his supervisor over. They had a heated discussion in rapid Japanese while staring at my passport. I assumed they were by my perfect pronunciation. I made Friends with a girl who seemed constantly on the edge of telling me something. She'd start sentences, then stop herself and shake her head. One day she asked.

In my family, the eldest daughter was expected to raise every child born after her, not help with, not babysit, but become their actual mother from the moment they arrived home from the hospital. I changed my first diaper when I was 6 years old. You see, my mother was a former teen mom who treated pregnancy like catching a cold, something that just happened to you. My father worked construction, but somehow his paychecks always disappeared into new tools or nights at the bar. They both came from huge families where this was just how things worked. By the time I was 8, I had three siblings under my care. My parents would leave for their date nights while I heated bottles and rocked crying babies. Soon you'll get married and pass the burden onto someone else, my mother would say each time she announced another pregnancy, her eyes landing on me like I was hired help. Fast forward eight years later, when I turned 14, my mother sat me down at the kitchen table with this formal announcement. She was pregnant again. Nothing new, except this time she handed me a notebook labeled Household Schedule with my name listed as primary caregiver from 6:00am to eleven PM your old enough to handle night feedings alone now, she said. My father nodded from his recliner. We cancelled your after school activities. Family comes first. The worst part was when they told me I need to get a work permit to buy diapers because they couldn't afford extras. They called it giving me real world experience. This is what love looks like in our culture, they said. You're so much better with them than we are. My day started at 5:00am, making breakfast for four kids while my parents slept in. I fell asleep during a parent teacher conference. Once my parents told everyone I must be partying. The youngest started calling me Mama at the grocery store and people would give us looks. Came the breaking point. I'd worked so hard to get a full academic scholarship to my dream college. The acceptance letter arrived on a Tuesday. For once, I wasn't an underage mother. I was just Lisa, a normal girl going to a normal college. I was in the middle of happy tears when my mother walked in. I'm pregnant, she yelled. My face dropped. It was twins. That was the same week that my dad decided to be even more neglectful than usual. I had to be the one to hold my mom's hair when she vomited, to massage her feet to fix her pregnancy cravings, all while taking care of the kids. The counselor called the next week saying I needed to submit final paperwork by three PM the baby got sick and wouldn't stop screaming. I missed the deadline by 10 minutes. The scholarship was withdrawn for lack of commitment. My parents said college would have been Selfish anyway, I started planning my escape in secret, applied to community college and got accepted. Got a part time job at a grocery store and hid my money in a tampon box. My 16 year old sister Sarah found out but promised to keep quiet. For once, everything was going according to plan. And so my parents found the acceptance letter I'd hidden in my chemistry textbook. My mother cried about all their sacrifices. My father threatened to kick me out if I abandoned the family. I didn't say a word. And the next day I came home from work to find the house riddled with social workers. Apparently my parents told them I was the neglectful caregiver who was supposed to be watching everyone. The social worker saw through it but gave me an impossible choice. Either I stayed as the primary caregiver or my siblings would go into foster care. My parents stood there smirking like they'd won. But I had an.

I was 20, working graveyard shifts at a 7 11 when I got slammed with a 1,200 dollar DUI that would destroy my entire life. The citation claimed I was driving drunk at 3:00am on Saturday, weaving between lanes and refusing a breathalyzer test. One problem. I don't drink alcohol. I'm a recovering addict who's been sober for three years. Officer Thompson wrote that he pulled me over outside Miller's Bar on Fifth Street. He claimed I reeked of alcohol, had bloodshot eyes, and failed every field sobriety test. But I was restocking energy drinks at 7 11 during my overnight shift. My register transactions showed I sold $847 worth of merchandise between 3 and 4 a m. The security cameras captured me behind the counter at the exact time he claimed I was drunk driving. I couldn't afford a lawyer. A DUI conviction would mean losing my license, my job, and probably going back to jail. So I printed everything. Work schedules, register logs, security footage, time stamps, even my three year sobriety chip. I. I practiced my defense speech until my hands stopped shaking. This was life or death. The courthouse reeked of desperation and broken dreams. I watched person after person accept plea deals for things that would ruin their lives. When they called my name, Officer Thompson walked up looking like he'd done this a thousand times. He was massive, intimidating, with dead eyes. And a bored expression. Your honor, I observed the defendant's vehicle swerving erratically on Fifth Street. Upon contact, the and exhibited classic signs of intoxication. Slurred speech, alcohol odor, bloodshot eyes. He became combative and refused all sobriety tests. Combative? I was working at 7 11, Officer Thompson. When it was my turn, I started carefully. Officer Thompson, what kind of car was I driving? He looked confident. Blue Ford sedan. Your honor, I don't own a car. I've never owned a car. I take the bus to work every night because I can't afford insurance.

I thought it would be a nice little snack to eat while going through the day and finishing my homework and studies. When I took the first bite, it tasted good, but then.

I said nothing and revealed what she'd hidden for years. When I was 19, my mom remarried Richard and suddenly decided I was too spoiled living in our family home. Time to learn independence, she said, kicking me out so Richard's son Tyler could have my room. My childhood bedroom became his gaming setup overnight. I'll never forget packing my stuff while Tyler lounged on my old bed, already planning where to put his new desk. Mom stood in the doorway with her arms crossed, explaining how this would build character. The same woman who used to make me hot chocolate when I had nightmares with now treating me like a burden she couldn't wait to get rid of. I crashed on couches for months. My friend Jake's mom let me sleep in their basement, but I felt like such a charity case. I worked three jobs. Morning shift at a coffee shop, afternoons at a retail store, nights doing delivery driving. I'd see families eating dinner together through restaurant windows and feel this hollow ache in my chest. Mom would post family vacation photos with Tyler in my old spot at the dinner table. Disney World trips, beach houses, fancy restaurants. Tyler wearing my old high school Letterman jacket in one photo. Really stung like I never existed. The worst part was running into them at the grocery store. Mom would get this awkward smile and ask how I was doing out there in the real world while Tyler stood behind her wearing brand new clothes. Meanwhile, I'm calculating if I can afford name brand pasta sauce. This week, I finally saved enough to rent a tiny studio apartment above a pizza place. The walls were thin, it smelled like pepperoni constantly, and the heat barely worked, but it was mine. I'd fall asleep listening to Tyler's Instagram stories about his awesome new room and best mom ever. During this time, I was the only one who visited grandma regularly. Every Sunday, I bring her groceries and we'd watch old movies together. She never asked why I looked so tired or why my clothes were getting loose from skipping meals. She just made sure I ate a real dinner every week and sent me home with leftovers. Grandma would tell me stories about growing up during the depression. How her family stuck together no matter what. Real family doesn't abandon each other when times get tough, she'd say, patting my hand. I always wondered if she knew what mom had done to me. Five years crawled by like this. I bounced between apartments, worked my way up to assistant manager positions, slowly built a small emergency fund. Mom would occasionally text on holidays. Generic thinking of you messages that felt more like obligation than love. Then grandma died suddenly. Heart attack in her sleep. At the funeral, mom cried dramatically while Tyler stood there checking his phone. I Was the one who held Grandma's hand during her final hospital visit. I was the one who knew she wanted to be buried next to Grandpa, wearing her blue dress. A week later, the lawyer called. Grandma had left me everything. Her house, her savings, her vintage jewelry collection that I'd always admired. The reading of the will was surreal. Mom kept shooting me confused glances, like there must be some mistake. But the real shock came when mom

I was 22, living my best life when my phone exploded with calls from my entire family. My cousin Eve, who was 16, told everyone I'd been sneaking into her room and that she was now pregnant with my baby. The whole family believed her instantly. My parents screamed at me over the phone, calling me disgusting. My siblings blocked me on everything. Even my grandparents who raised me wouldn't take my calls. I had zero proof it wasn't true. Eve was the family princess. I was just a black sheep cousin who barely came around anymore. The accusation spread like wildfire through our tight knit extended family. Aunts and uncles who used to invite me to barbecues suddenly acted like I didn't exist. My mom's sister, Eve's mother, posted critical Facebook statuses about protecting our children from predators in our own family. Within a week, I was completely erased from every family group chat, every holiday plan, every graduation announcement. The next year destroyed me completely. I waited every day for police to show up at my door with handcuffs. Every knock made my heart stop. Every phone call from an unknown number sent me into a panic attack. I lost my job at the auto shop because I couldn't focus, kept making mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss finally sat me down and said, whatever was going on? At home, needed to stay there, but I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment three months later when I couldn't make rent, moved in with a buddy who let me crash on his couch. But even he started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Started drinking heavily just to sleep, then drinking to get through the day, then drinking because breathing felt impossible without it. Dating became a nightmare. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried to date asked to meet my parents. After 2 months, I made up some story about them being dead. Second girl saw through the lies when she noticed I had 0 family photos, no childhood stories, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. And when I couldn't give a straight answer, she was gone by morning. The isolation was crushing. Holidays were the worst. Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call. I'd drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway knowing they were all inside without me. I finally moved three states away and started completely over. New job, new friends, new identity. Told everyone I met that my family lived far away and we weren't close. Simple, clean lie that people accepted. Got into therapy, got sober, worked my ass off to build something resembling a normal life.

He usually sleeps with me, but he isn't coming in, and I'm scared. Bro, he's a dog. He's probably eating. You're so mean for no reason. Thanks. I'm trying my best. I hate you. I love you, too. You drive, right? Obviously. I'm 17. Okay, drive me back home from camp. Uh, why? Because I'm done with camp. Why can't mom do it? Because I want you to drop me off at chick fil A. Why? You ask too many questions. Just come. No, I'm in camp, too. Yeah, but mine is summer school, and that's more important than yours. Well, mine is still more important than chick fil A. Not even you're more important than chick fil A. Cute. Come get me. I told mom you're waiting. She's coming to get you. Bro, I hate you. I love you, too. Shut up! You're so stupid. I'm home. Where were you? I picked up dad from the airport. Okay, I don't care that you're home. The door is locked, so we don't have the key. Oh, my bad. Eat some celery. You're so fat. What?

Yeah, that's right. Turn off the shower and read these texts. So tell me, what the fuck is your problem? I don't know. But I know that your problem is your singing. And your problem is your attitude. Oh, good one. Got me shaking and quaking in my boots. Yeah, if you could afford boots, bro. What? I'm literally a child. Of course I can't afford boots. Take a joke, Mark. Learn to make one. I know how mom made you. Thank you very much. Bro, you're so pressed. Unlike your nose. That thing is the opposite of flat. You can't talk. Your nose is like a bridge. I'd like to use you as a bridge and step on your face. What happened to you? You never text anymore. You never talk anymore. Ever since you went to dumb college. Whenever I mess around about something, you take it seriously. I'm just kidding. Obviously. Hello? I know you can read this, you hole. You wouldn't know. You're barely 8 years old. I'm literally 13, bro. I hate you. I love you too. Happy birthday. I don't care. You don't even come over on holidays anymore. Why would I respond to you? Okay, why are you so different? It's so stupid. It's like you packed up your bags, clothes and double chin and moved out. You're already ugly at home. Why make everyone else hate you somewhere else too? Oh, and you, Take it so seriously. We're siblings. We are not supposed to be nice. That's not really true, Mark. I don't care. I hate you. I never won't hate you. I hate me, too. Oh, it's my fault, right? My fault that you're gone. I'm in high school now. I understand now that you were insecure and I truly was a jerk. Brody died today. I read our texts and cried. Boys aren't supposed to cry. But you told me. It's okay. I love you. Do you still love me, too?

Don't be so harsh. It's her first shh day. Maybe she's just trying to figure things out. Yeah, I guess. But why would I bother talking to anyone else when I have you? Ah, you're too sweet. Don't worry, she'll know soon enough that you're all schmine. Good. I'd never leave you anyway. Wanna grab dinner tonight? We can stop by your favorite burger place. Oh my god, yes!

I have to train the new girl tomorrow. What are the chances they put me on that? No way! Just be nice to her. Maybe you can be her friend. I don't need new friends when I have you. You're too sweet. Just don't be mean, that's all I'm saying. I'll try my best, but if she keeps asking dumb stuff, we might have a problem. Haha, don't stress too much. Just try to have fun. I'm heading to bed. See you tomorrow. Hey, we didn't talk much today. How was training with Sophia? Honestly, better than I expected. She chilled out with the dumb Questions. And she's actually pretty funny. Guess what her favorite movie is. What? The incredible. What are the odds? No way! That's my favorite movie. What a crazy coincidence. She must be cool, then. I know, right? Yeah. I think you'd actually get along with her. You should talk to her. Tomorrow. Maybe. Anyway, I gotta study for a test. I'll see you tomorrow? Of course. Good luck on your test. Daniel, you barely even looked at me at work today. You were with Sophia the whole time. Babe, come on. Don't be like that. Training takes more than a day. Once it's over, you know, I'll make it up to you, I guess. Learn anything else about her? Yeah, actually. She loves sushi and she's really into working out. Cantina app. I need roast bot. My boyfriend doesn't give me attention because of a new girl. What should I do now? Just say she lifts weights, you lift excuses. She lifts weights, you lift excuses. Oof. That one hit. Use Cantina app to improve your roasting skills. Do you wanna hang out tonight? I don't think I can, babe. I was gonna hit the gym, but tomorrow for sure. Okay. I'll just stay in and watch movies then. Have fun. Talk to you later. Of course, babe. Babe, why weren't you at work today? I don't know. Just wasn't feeling great, I guess. Hope you feel better soon. Can you come over? I don't think I can, babe. Why? Not you always bring me food and medicine when I'm sick. you know how some theaters bring back old movies for a limited time? Yeah. What does that have to do with anything? I can't go anywhere. I'm sick. They're playing the Incredibles. I thought I'd take Sophia to see it since she was looking for something fun to do. You're taking Sophia to see my favorite movie? Mia, don't be selfish. Also her favorite movie. And you're sick. As you said yourself, you can't go anywhere. Wow, what's up with this girl? Why is she all you talk about now? Are you seriously trying to start an argument right now? I'm just asking. We're dating, and yet you keep talking about her. And now you're taking her to do something I've always wanted to do with you? I don't know. Maybe because she actually makes me happy and doesn't just sit around and scroll on TikTok all day. Instead, she actually does things to improve herself. Wow. So that's how it is, right? Wait. I mean, yeah, she cares about me. I have to beg you to care about me. Okay, well, I guess we're done, then. Have fun at the movies. I will. Thanks. Mia, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for how I acted yesterday. That wasn't me. Why weren't you at work today? Still sick? I quit. What? Why? You love that job. Sometimes the things you love don't always love you back.

Womp, womp. What do you mean womp, womp? You don't even care. She was your girlfriend for 2 years, Justin. She loved you for 2 years. Listen, Tammy, this is not my problem. She overreacted and did something irrational. That's on her, not me. Justin, you literally broke her heart. How could you after the 2 years of her being there for you when big sis Jessica passed away? That hurt us bad. And she was there for you, making sure you were okay. When you couldn't take me to school because you were too sad to get out of the bed, Emma came to take me. She would always take care of me like how our big sister would before she passed. She would always buy me food, pack my lunch and would even come over to watch me and take care of me when nobody was home. She would stay home with me just to play barbies with me to make sure I wasn't scared being alone. She was the best girlfriend you ever had. She was the sister I needed after big sis passed away. And now you're the reason why Emma is gone because you were selfish and cheated. I don't have time to read a lot. Go cry to someone else. Leave me be. One day you will see you lost the best thing you had. Stop talking to me, mom. I still can't believe she's gone. I couldn't stop. Crying after seeing her in the casket. I know, baby. It broke all of our hearts. We lost a beautiful soul that day. She was the perfect daughter I never asked for, always taking care of us like she was a part of this family. We will miss her forever. Yeah, everyone will miss her except Justin. Justin is so evil. How could he do that to her? I talked to your brother, Tammy, and what he did was absolutely terrible and unforgivable. He should be grounded forever. Sadly, I can't do anything since he's a 20 year old man. Mommy, I really think this is my fault. If I would have just shut my mouth, Emma would still be here. But I decided to be a loud mouth. This is all because of me, baby. No, you did the right thing. Don't ever feel bad about doing the right thing. Yeah. Mommy, could you at least take me to see Emma again? I miss her so much. I want to play barbies with her. I wish I could, Tammy, but I'm so tired and I have work tomorrow. Auntie, can you send me a rizzapp line so Mommy can take me? This will for sure make Mommy smile. Say this. My love for you will give you all the energy you need. My love for you will give you all the energy you need. Oh, that's so sweet. You're right. I do have enough energy for one more trip. Meet me at the car. Yay! I'm bringing my barbies. I'm bringing my new barbies to come play with you. Emma, I miss you so much. You were the best thing I had in my life. I will never forget you. And I'll keep that promise that we made at your grave that I will come play barbies with you every single day. I love you so much. Mommy, when will you be back from work? I have to go see Emma again today so we can play barbies. Yesterday was so fun with her. I was so happy I could spend time with her. Sorry, baby, I won't be able to make it home on time because of this snowstorm. But Mommy, I made a promise to Emma that I would never miss a day. I'm so sorry, Tammy, but I can't today. Don't be sorry, Mommy. I won't break my promise to Emma. Wait, honey, what do you mean by that? Tammy? Justin, where is Tammy? I don't know. Why are you asking me? You didn't watch over your little sister? I looked over the entire house and she's not here. And that's my problem. How, oh, my god. I think she went to Emma's grave. Wait. How would she even be able to walk all the way over there by herself in the snow? No time for questions. Get in your car and drive to the cemetery now. Whatever. Did you find anything, Justin? I looked around. And found nothing. Oh, my God. Not my Tammy. Well, actually, I did find this one thing, two frozen barbies in front of Emma's Tombstone. Oh, my God. No.

Where did you hear that date? It was in the note with Dad's watch. The watch you said was destroyed. Emma, where are you right now? Still at Jessica's. Her mom's about to drive me home. Number? Go to Aunt Claire's instead. Don't come home. You're scaring me. What's going on with these texts from Dad's number? Someone is trying to manipulate you. Your father died in that accident last month. Then why is his watch here? Why does someone know about July 15th? Your father's former partner must have gotten access to his personal effects. What partner? You said dad worked alone. I needed to protect you from certain aspects of his work. There's another text. Ask about the offshore account in the Caymans. Don't respond to any more messages. They're trying to get information. Information about what? What was dad involved in? Your father was an accountant for some powerful people. He found discrepancies. Criminal discrepancies. Was dad in danger? We're in the car now. Jessica's mom is acting strange. She keeps checking her mirrors. Is she taking you to our house or to Claire's? Neither. We're heading toward the lakehouse where the text said to go. Emma, that's not Jessica's mother. The real Carol has a scar on her wrist. She's wearing long sleeves. I can't tell. Ask to use her phone. Say yours is dying. She refused. Said her battery is low, too. Try to get a look at her wrist. Find An excuse. I asked her to check the time. No scar. Mom, who is this woman? Listen carefully. When she slows down at the next intersection, unlock your door and run. She just locked all the doors from her control panel. Is there anything in the car you can use as a weapon? Jessica's field hockey stick is in the backseat. I'm 10 minutes from the lakehouse. Is she still heading there? Yes. She just got a call. She's speaking another language. Sounds Eastern European. Your father's files exposed an international money laundering operation. Dad was just an accountant. How did he get involved in this? He was recruited specifically because of his skills. He didn't know what they were hiding. She's pulling over at the convenience store. Says she needs cigarettes. This is your chance. Get out while she's inside. I can't. She took the keys and told me she'll be watching through the window. Check the glove compartment. Is there anything useful? There's a gun, mom. A real gun. Don't touch it. It could be a setup. She's coming back. She's talking to someone outside the car. Take a photo of them. Discreetly, if you can. Done. Sending it now. That's Andre Kozlov. He worked with your father's firm. We're driving again. They're taking me to the lakehouse. The watch, Emma, is there anything unusual about it? The back has a small SD card taped to it. I never noticed before. That's what they want. Your father must Have copied the evidence. Should I destroy it? No. It's the only leverage we have. It's evidence of their entire operation. We're at the lakehouse. There's a black SUV waiting. I'm two minutes away. Can you see who's in the SUV? It's Mister Peterson from Dad's office. The one who spoke at his funeral. He's the one who recruited your father. He's been leading this whole operation. She's making me get out of the car, stall, ask questions, keep them talking until I get there. Peterson says he just wants the watch and we'll be safe. He's lying. They can't leave witnesses. He's showing me a badge. FBI. Is that possible? Huh? Boost for part three.

Okay, so you have an ex? Yes. And what is his. What is his name? Brian. Okay, and when did he become your ex? Like, how fresh is this? It was last year, but we still talk to each other all the time. Okay, so. But he's dating someone else now? Yes. And her name is Hannah, and she seems totally nice and everything. I know a few people who know her, too. They said she's super nice, and they seem happy together. But here's the thing. I keep telling her that Brian is doing things behind her back, and she keeps ignoring me when I try to help. Okay. Do. Doing what things behind her back? Talking to other girls, talking to me still, and trying to get me to actually hook up with him. So Brian is still trying to hook up with you even though he has a new girl? Pretty much. And I tried getting a message out to her, and she blocked me, so I just. Yeah. Oh, wow. Well, how did you try contacting her? Contacting her? Did you, like, DM her or something? Like, what'd you do? Yeah, I tried dming her through Instagram, but she blocked me right away. She told her friends not to talk to me either. She told them I was Brian's psycho ex. But really, truthfully, all I'm trying to do is help her here. Okay, so you're trying to be the nice person here so she doesn't get her heart broken like you did? Basically, yeah. Okay, but she won't listen to you. Probably cause Brian himself is probably been like, ah, she's my psycho ex, don't listen to her. I guess, yeah. Okay, yeah, but the whole thing is. Didn't you say Brian was still trying to hook up with you? Like he's still trying to get with you. I mean, we're supposed to be going out for drinks this weekend and he specifically told me not to mention it to anyone because of Hannah. Oh wow, that's shady. Okay, so. But she doesn't believe you. Well, alright, what if we did this? What if we got Brian on the phone, okay, and then also had this Hannah girl on listening, like on a third line. And then you sort of talked about hooking up or your little drinks date coming up. And then she'd be able to hear everything herself. That way you wouldn't have to convince anybody of anything cause she'd hear it for herself. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Okay. Alright, good. So it's an old fashioned Three Way call. We can set that up, no problem. Wait, do we have the other girl's number? Oh yeah, do we have. Yeah, This new Hannah Girls phone number. I have her number, yes. Oh, okay, well, there you go. Three Way. Action time it is. We'll do that when we come back. Next we're gonna do an old fashioned zoo morning zoo Three Way. But before we get to the actual call. And we're ready to go with this. Yes. Okay, so please welcome Hannah to the show. Hello, Hannah. Hello. So, shag talked to you already, right? We're on live. Watch the language, that sort of thing. Yes. Okay, so before we bring her on, Hannah, tell us what you know about Chantal, your current man. Brian's ex. Uh. Oh, boy. Um, not much. Just that they dated, they broke up, and she's sort of crazy, I guess. Oh, okay, let's bring Chantelle on real quick. So, Chantelle, before we do this, what did you want to say to Hannah? Just that I am not crazy, and I'm only trying to prevent you here from getting hurt. That's. That's it? That's really it? Okay, Hannah, I mean, if. Okay, if you're just trying to help me, then what was wrong with keeping all this private? Like, why do we have to do all of this on the radio? Because you won't answer me when I try to talk to you. You blocked me on Instagram, that's why. Yeah, I blocked you because Brian asked me to. He said he didn't want you spying on him. Well, like I said, I'm only. I'm only Trying to help you here. Okay, so listen, we came up with this idea here real quick. We wanted to call Brian up, and then. Chantelle, why don't you ask him about your supposed upcoming date that he made with you behind Hannah's back and see what he says? Fine with me. And Hannah. We're gonna turn your line down while she's talking to him, but you're still gonna get to hear everything that's being said. Okay? I mean, I just think this is really immature, but whatever. Okay, hang on, Chantal. We're gonna call him up here, and when he answers, you're on. Okay?

You're out drinking with the boys, right? Staying at a buddy's place if it gets late. You're so smart. Babe, we've got a work dinner thing tonight. I know. Don't wait up for me, okay? No need to leave the door unlocked. Got it. Babe, can I ask you something? You're so chill about this. Aren't you worried I might do something I shouldn't? If that's what you wanna do, could I stop you? Anyway, it's your call. You've changed so much. Feel like I barely know you lately. The old you would have made me come home no matter how late. Can I ask you something, too? Did the old me annoy you? If we're both gonna be miserable, might as well let you have your fun. Babe, I love you. Don't worry. I won't nag you to come home anymore. No more overthinking, either. If you drink too much, crash at your buddies. I get it now. No more micromanaging you or fighting over little things. Babe, I'm touched you feel this way. I'll love you more and more. Hmm. Have a good time with your friends. Hey. We'll do. Babe. Just got off work. You didn't forget what day it is, right? It's my birthday. Going out with Co workers. Wanna join? I'll pass. Don't know your work friends would be awkward. Happy birthday. Thanks, babe. Love you. You sure you won't come? I'm sure. Alright. Did you get me a birthday gift? Nope. You always used to plan ahead. Why nothing for my birthday this year? You never liked the gifts I got before, right? Figured cash would be better. Money is what matters anyway. Better to focus on making more dollar than stressing over gifts. You've grown up. I knew you were the best. I'll be home early tonight, babe. Heading home now. I had a bit too much feeling dizzy. I'm home. Babe. You're not here. Where'd you go? Still at work. Overtime, tons to do. Deadline tomorrow. Go to bed. I'll be back when I'm done. Babe, my head's killing me. Okay, noted. Did you hear me? My head hurts. Can't talk. Busy. We'll discuss when I'm back. Changed? You don't care about me at all anymore. So cold and distant. Nothing like when we first met. I go out now. No calls, no texts. Let me ask you. Isn't this what you wanted? Not prying, giving you space. This is what you told me before. I'm doing it now. Isn't that enough? What more do you want? Why are you unhappy now? You've got it all wrong, babe. This isn't what I wanted. I want you to be your old self again. The girl who only had eyes for me. Back to how We were when we first fell in love. It's too late. We can't go back. I'm numb now. I see things clearly. Let the past be the past. There's something I've wanted to tell you for a while.

Oh, my god. I was just about to do the same thing. Our phones were switched. I know. I hate this stupid school. They are the only ones who take our phones for assemblies. It's so annoying. Anyways, when can we meet? Uh, about that. What? My family and I were going on a road trip right after school, and we already left. We are an hour away, and trust me, I can't make them mad by asking to go back. You're lying. What the hell am I going to do with your phone for however long you are gone? I'm gone for the weekend. What? I can't wait three days. I have things to do. You know, sorry, Adam, but I don't know what to say. You're going to have to wait. Wait. How do you know who I am? Oh, uh, yeah, you know, I heard of you, at least. But how did you know it was my phone? When you texted me, I clicked on the notification and it showed your messages. Your last text was from your mom. So we are going through each other's messages now? No, no, it wasn't like that. I didn't mean to. Ha ha. I know. I'm just playing with you. So who am I speaking to then? You don't know me. Let's just keep it that way. Oh, come on. That's no fun. What's your name? Lily. Lily Smith. Yeah, you know me? Well, you know, heard of you. At least. Ah, you got me there. Yeah. Ha ha. So are we really doing this? Three days with each other's phones? There's no other choice. Unless you wanna drive six hours to meet us at our first stop, be my guest. Yeah, I don't know about all that. Anyways, let's make this interesting. How about we both can choose one app that's off limits? Alright, what app are you gonna choose? I choose notes. Notes? What the hell you got going on in there? Nothing. I chose it so now you can't see it. Okay then I'm going to do Snapchat. I wonder why. Oh stop it. Are you trying to call me a fuck boy? Ha ha. Maybe. At least get to know me. Just because I play football does not mean I'm one of them. I guess we will have to wait and see. Oh shoot, my dad just told me cell service is about to go out. We are in the middle of nowhere. I'll text you in a bit. Alright, see you soon Lily. Gosh, that was long. Thankfully you had games on your phone. Oh yeah, glad I could help. Haha, those come in handy sometimes. Hey, I have a question. Are you still dating Emma? Emma? How do you know about her? Everyone was talking about you guys and how great of a couple you were. Oh, well thankfully that's no longer. Thankfully? Yeah, she cheated on me. Oh my god, I'm so Sorry. No, no, don't be. I'm glad it happened. Why? Rizz app. What should I say? Because now I got my eyes on finding someone better. Because now I got my eyes on finding someone better. Oh. Anyone in mind? Uh, I don't know. I guess you could say I have a little crush. Really? Who? Ha, ha. You aren't gonna find out that easy. Oh, my god, you are really going to make me wait. Well, you are making me wait 3 days for my phone, so I think you can wait as well. Okay, maybe you're right. Ha, ha. It's getting kind of late. I think I'm gonna head to bed. Okay. Good night, Adam. Good night, Lily. Good morning, Lily. I hope you slept well. If you count sleeping in the back of a van sleeping well, then I guess you could say I did. Oh, yeah. Ha, ha. I forgot about that. Hey, I have a question. Go for it. What's in your notes that is so important? Oh, my god, stop. You can't look. I won't, but I'm curious now. Ha ha. Well, how about this? At the end of the trip, you can open my notes app on one condition. Which is? You tell me who your crush is. Oh, I think I could work with that. Yay! So where did you guys road trip to? We just got to Baltimore. No way. I have family there. Could they meet you and get my Phone. Oh, I mean, we are just about to leave now. I don't think we can. Haha, I'm just messing with you. I don't have family there. Oh my god, you scared me for a second. I'm guessing you're not actually leaving. Just wanted to keep talking. Well, I guess you could say you were right. Haha, I knew it. I'm actually sort of glad this all happened. Me too. You're really fun to talk to. Oh, thanks. I think I'm gonna go play some basketball. Okay. Have fun. Who said I was going? How are you gonna play while texting me? That's why Facetime was invented. Facetime? Uh, I don't know about that. Why not? I don't look good right now. Oh stop it. I see you every day and you look amazing all the time. Now is no different. Do you really think that? Of course. OMG, you're so sweet. Ha ha. I tried. Now pick up. Alright. Well that was fun, wasn't it? Yeah, you could say that. I didn't know you were that good at basketball. You play football? Ha ha. Well, what can I say? An athlete is an athlete. I'm gonna shower and get ready for bed now, Adam. Okay. I'll have you know though, tomorrow is the big day. Yeah. Ha ha. See you then. Good morning, Adam. Wakey Wakey, I'm awake. Your message notification can wake up my whole house, let alone just me. Haha yeah, it is a pretty loud one. So can I go on the notes app yet? Not just yet. Have some patience. You can do it when I'm an hour away from home. And how long is that gonna be? Well, for starters, I'm 6 hours out. Oh, my god. So long. For what? This better be good. Hopefully you like it. Me? Why would I like it? Oh, I don't know. I mean, just like after the wait. I hope you like it. I see. Well, I never thought I would be texting myself, but I will say this has been pretty fun. Same to you, Adam. Yeah, I was going to complain to the school about getting our phones mixed up, but I guess I'll cut them a break this time. Ha ha. This time. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. If it's with you, I wouldn't mind. Oh, okay, Adam, we are going back to a no service area. I'll text you when I'm close. Okay. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

Take it up with god. If you can excuse me, I'm going to look for an outfit Jack will really appreciate. Mom, please! Mom, what did you do? You took Jack to the room and I heard you two making macaroni and cheese sounds. There's no way you actually did it. I told you Honey Bun, this is your punishment. You thought I was joking? Jakey Poo is mine now. You think you deserved a guy that handsome and tall? I bet you Haven't even seen his pencil yet. Mama did first, and it's huge. Haha!

Well, since you were staring at me in class, why don't I give you a little detention after school today? And maybe I'll let you in my back door. No one else has ever done that before? Nope. Not even your husband? Not a soul. I might have to take you up on that offer. Glad to hear. Ethan, your detention starts at 3. And when does it end? My detentions end when I say they end. See you at 3, Mrs. Star.

Excuse me? You heard me. I'm not paying rent anymore. It's a waste of money. I'd rather spend it on important things. My nails, my hair, my shopping. And since you have this whole house to yourself, I decided I'll just live here instead. No, no, no, no. You are not moving in. Oh, don't be selfish. You have all this space and I'm struggling out there trying to survive while my son sits in luxury. You are not struggling. You just don't want to pay for anything unless it benefits you. Exactly. Why should I waste my hard earned money on rent when I can use it for more important things? My nails are due for a fill, my roots are showing, and there's a sale at the mall that I can't miss. You don't even work. You have no hard earned money. And whose fault is that? What? Hey, I'm gonna come over, see your new house. You still have that room for me, right? Uh, yeah. Just don't come today. I need to deal with something. Alright, fine. I just miss you. Same. Rizz app, help me rizz her up. Rizz app tells me to say I really miss that gorgeous smile of yours. I really miss that gorgeous smile of yours. Oh, you're so sweet. Can't wait to see you tomorrow night. If you weren't so difficult, maybe I wouldn't be in this position. But no, you just had to run off and Leave your poor mother behind, struggling to get by? Struggling? You spend every dime you get on yourself. Meanwhile, I had to start from scratch because you sold everything I owned. And look at you now, doing just fine, which means you can take care of your mother like a good son should. No, I'm not doing this. Oh, sweetie, you don't have a choice. Yes, I do. I can say no. No, you can't, because I'm already outside your door. Open up! You're out of your mind. Go away. Oh, I will. Right after you let me in, I'll call the cops. And tell them what? That your poor, loving mother just wants a roof over her head? That her selfish son is trying to leave her homeless while he sits in a house full of things he wouldn't even have without me? You contributed nothing to my success. Nothing! Fine. I'll let myself in. What? No. You really should have hidden your spare key better. How did you even. Oh, and don't bother hiding your bank cards. I already linked my shopping apps to them. You what? I needed a little retail therapy. It's exhausting being me. Where is all my furniture? Sold. I got a really good deal on all of it. Ha ha ha ha! 300 for the entire dining set and TV. Already booked my hair appointment. I'm so excited. No, no, no, no. No comment. Part 3 to see the sun get revenge.

Yesterday, my phone rang at 2:00am. It was the police. Ma'am, we have your 6 year old son, Tommy at the station. He walked here by himself, saying his mommy hurt his baby sister. I shot out of bed. What? Tommy's in his room sleeping. And I don't have a baby sister. Ma'am, please come down to the station immediately. I ran to Tommy's room. Empty bed, front door wide open. At the police station, Tommy was wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The moment he saw me, he screamed, don't let her take me! She killed my sister. My heart stopped. The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, Buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away, too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room while Tommy sobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My Stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. I spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. His little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. Psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy story never changed. Hours passed. Detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She. She showed me the room she made all pink. And pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us? But before I could answer,

And he's just short by a tiny bit. How much is he short? Only 48 thousand dollars. I already told him we'd help. We have plenty of money anyway. A 50 thousand dollar car and he's short forty eight thousand dollars? Is this some kind of joke? Why don't I just buy him the whole car then? Yes, yes. You're the best husband ever. Quick, give me the money! Hold on, he makes $200 a month. How's he going to maintain it? Gas, insurance, repairs. Besides, our own car only cost $20,000. He absolutely must have a car. He's getting married soon. A 50 thousand dollar car gives him so much face. I think when buying cars, you should go straight to the top. Mom, my brother and I already went car shopping and we all agree it's perfect. Hmm. A 50 thousand dollar car. I'm sure it's nice even without seeing it. Hurry up, babe. Give me the money. They need the deposit today. Why am I the one paying? Do you know why I don't let you handle our money anymore? It's precisely to prevent this. When you managed our finances, we were always in the red because you kept funneling money to your family. Now we finally saved a bit and you're pulling this again? You're his brother in law. He's buying a car for his wedding. Such an important event. Just help him out. When He has money later. He'll definitely take care of you. Ha! I'm going to call your brother right now. Call? What for? Hey, brother, your sister's husband here. Got something to discuss with you. What's up, bro? What's going on? So I spotted this great apartment, but I'm short $5,000 on the down payment. Wondering if I could borrow from you. Huh? Don't you already have two apartments? Why buy another one? Look, don't buy it right now. I'm trying to get a car and was planning to borrow $48,000 from you. What? You wanna borrow from me too? And $48,000? I've already paid the deposit on this place. I really don't have extra cash. Are you doing this on purpose? You knew I wanted to buy a car, and now you pull this stunt? Brother, don't get upset. I'm not targeting you. Just trying to understand something. From what you're saying, I should lend you $48,000 without question, but you can't lend me $5,000? Is. Is that the logic here? You've known about my car plans forever. How could I possibly have money to lend you? You won't even lend me $5,000, so why should I lend you $48,000? Isn't that a blatant double standard? Because you're my sister's husband. Oh, so just because I'm your sister's husband, I'm obligated to support you unconditionally? I have zero responsibility toward you. I spent a fortune on our wedding when I married your sister. This isn't even a life or death Situation. I'm done talking to you. I'll ask my sister directly. All our money is with me. Going to her won't help. Listen to me. You will give this money to my brother. Give me the money now! Amy, listen to yourself. This isn't healthy. You know what's not healthy? Watching my brother struggle while we sit in our comfortable house with money in the bank. I guess I finally see where your priorities lie.

Don't fuck with a woman who can take shots of tequila, whiskey or vodka straight without cringing. Excuse me, sir. I'm I'm sorry. What does anybody else see the problem here? No, let me break it down. for those of you that have never worked in a bar or restaurant before, in this gorgeous ass bottle we have Clase Azul Reposado Tequila. It's probably some of the most delicious tequila you will ever have in your whole life. It's because it tastes like cream soda. The problem that I'm having right here and right there and right there is it total wine this cost $250 at a restaurant for a shot. It's anywhere from like 80 to $120. So the problem is not only are you letting this super delicious tequila drip down to the floor and go to waste which party foul, but because it tastes like cream soda, anybody could knock that back. You ain't bad and bougie girl, you just bougie but high key I respect the flex. So until you can take shots of tequila, vodka or whiskey from those cheap 15 dollar plastic bottles from the grocery store or the questionable jungle juice of fraternity parties, then you can come talk to me.

I gave her a home in jail instead. When I got into the school play, Emma suddenly developed a passion for theatre and needed private acting lessons. When I made the honor role, Emma claimed I was pressuring her academically and needed a tutor to catch up from her trauma. When I got into medical school and needed to live at home to save money, Emma said I was robbing her of her safe space. My parents bent over backwards for Emma. They paid for her to study abroad in Paris. She dropped out after two months. They bought her a car when she said public transport triggered her abandonment issues. They funded her photography business, her jewelry making phase, her life coaching certification and her yoga instructor training. None of it stuck. Meanwhile, I was working three jobs to pay for my MCAT prep, studying until 3:00am and still helping mom with dinner every night. But according to Emma, I was the problem. Everything exploded. Six months ago, I was in my final year of medical school, doing rotations at the hospital 80 hours a week, barely sleeping, surviving on coffee and whatever mom left for me in the fridge. Emma had just been evicted from her apartment for not paying rent. She showed up at family dinner with a therapist, an actual therapist she'd convinced to come to our house for an intervention. Doctor Morrison Is here to facilitate a healing conversation, Emma announced, about how Rebecca's presence in this house is preventing me from processing my adoption trauma. My parents were stunned. The therapist, who looked deeply uncomfortable, pulled out notes that were clearly all from Emma's perspective. Emma feels that Rebecca's continued presence in the family home at age 28 is creating an unbalanced dynamic that triggers her abandonment wounds. The therapist read, she needs a safe space to rebuild her relationship with her adoptive parents without the biological child's overshadowing presence. I'm here because medical school is expensive, I said. Slowly. I pay rent. I buy groceries. I'm barely here except to sleep. That's exactly the problem, Emma cried. You're the perfect daughter, even when you're absent. How am I supposed to compete with that? Nobody's asking you to compete, mom said gently. You don't understand, Emma screamed. She's your real daughter. I'll always be the charity case you took in. The therapist suggested that maybe I could temporarily relocate to give Emma space to heal. My parents desperate to help. Emma actually asked if I consider stay.

I texted our family group chat emergency appendectomy tomorrow. Need someone to pick up Max from daycare. My sister Amber replied, lol can't. We're literally boarding for Cabo right now. Mom added, ask your neighbor. This trip cost us $3,000. I simply wrote, got it. My four year old son Max had been asking all week why Aunt Lily and grandma couldn't help when dad he was sick. I told him they were on an important trip. He nodded seriously and said, more important than you getting better. The drive to the hospital at 5:00am was terrifying. Max's overnight bag was packed with his stuffed elephant and three days worth of clothes. Mrs. Chen, my seventy four year old neighbor, at her door in her bathrobe. She spoke broken English but hugged Max like he was her own grandson. Don't worry, she whispered to me. I take good care. What was supposed to be a routine appendectomy turned into a nightmare. Internal bleeding kept me unconscious for 18 hours. When I I woke up, machines were beeping and tubes were everywhere. The surgeon explained I need to stay at least six days for monitoring. My phone had dozens of missed calls, but none from family. Instead, there were voicemails from Missus Chen in her careful English. Max eating good breakfast. He helped me water plants. He very good boy. Day three I was Finally stable enough to Facetime. Max sitting at Mrs. Chen's kitchen table, carefully folding dumplings with tiny fingers covered in flour. Daddy! Mrs. Chen teaching me to make food. She says I'm very smart. He held up a lopsided dumpling proudly. In the background, Mrs. Chen beamed and gave me a thumbs up. That same day, my phone rang. Hospital administration. Mr. Rodriguez, your mother called demanding to speak with your doctor about visiting hours. She was quite insistent about getting details regarding your condition. When we explained you've been here since Monday with complications from emergency surgery, she became extremely upset. I was confused. She called you? Yes. She seems surprised you were here at all. She mentioned something about thinking you were being dramatic about a simple procedure. Thirty minutes later, my phone exploded. Mom? Daniel, why didn't you tell us you were dying? Amber? OMG, I'm literally shaking RN. I had no idea it was serious. Mom again? We're booking flights home right now. This is insane. I was too weak to respond immediately, but I managed to piece together what happened through a friend who'd seen Amber's Instagram stories. She'd been posting beach content all week, including a story yesterday of Max eating breakfast at some random Asian lady's house with crying, laughing emojis. The caption read, my brother's parenting choices are wild. Like, why is my nephew at a stranger's house? Elmo. A family friend, Mrs. Rodriguez from church had in the story and called Mom in a panic. Why is Little Mac staying with strangers? Where's Daniel? Is everything okay? Mom had apparently brushed it off, saying I was being dramatic about a minor surgery and that I was probably partying or dating someone new while Mac stayed elsewhere. But Mrs. Rodriguez kept pressing. It's been four days, Maria. A four year old shouldn't be away from his

Back in college, there was this guy named Steve who lied about everything. Not small stuff, either. This dude claimed he turned down the Olympics because he wasn't in the mood to be famous. But one day, the wildest thing happened in history class. We were talking about major tech company when Steve casually goes, fun fact, my great great grandfather actually created Google, but the government erased him from the records. The entire room went dead silent. Someone finally asked, you mean Larry Page and Sergey Brin? Steve just shook his head and said, nah, that's what they want you to think. The truth's been buried. You'll only find what they want you to see. Even the professor looked confused. Steve, do you even know how Google works? He replied, yeah, my grandpa invented the algorithm. They just renamed it and erased us. The class exploded. People were crying, laughing. Even the professor had to turn around to hide his face. But Steve wasn't done. He stood up and said, swear on my life, I've got proof at home. Someone asked, okay then, if your family made Google, what exactly did they invent? Steve, dead serious, says they figured out how to make computers think like humans. It was called G1. Someone in the back yells, bro, what are you even saying? Steve's face turned red, but instead of backing down, double down! Started yelling about how history Is fake. How? His family has the real files. And then ran out of the classroom. The next day, he showed up with some printed out document in old cursive and went, this document proves it. It's from the original Google files. That's when it all fell apart. One guy in the back pulled out his phone, reverse search the image, and the first result that popped up was a Pinterest post titled Old Looking Tech Documents for Aesthetic School Projects. The whole class erupted. Even the professor lost it. One guy yelled, bro, found this on Tumblr. Steve turned bright red and shouted, you're all brainwashed! Then stormed out. We never saw him in that class again.

It cost me an entire year of my life. If I hadn't gotten a second chance, I wouldn't still be alive. It was a hot and humid summer day in Manhattan. I was making my way through the park on the way to grab lunch with some of my coworkers. That's when I saw her. She was breathtaking. She was sitting on the park bench reading. She looked up at me as I walked by and then looked back down at the book. It was odd. She seems sort of familiar to me. I continued on, but about 10 seconds after passing her, I realized that I didn't know her. She knew my friend Jack from college and we had met briefly at a party a few years back. As I turned around to take another look and confirm, I caught her in the middle of her own double take. I decided that lunch could wait and made a complete 180 and walked right back over to her. Maria, right? Yes. You're Kevin, Jack's friend. I knew you seemed familiar. I guess I couldn't recognize you in that suit, she replied, setting down her book. What are you doing now that we graduated? Must be something in business. Based on the suit, proudly, I told her, investment banking. It's only my second week, but it is very exciting. How about you? Ooh. So you've sold your soul. Just kidding. But I have Heard those hours are rough. As for me, I'm a photographer. It's always been my passion and now it's my job and I love it, she said. And then she looked me in the face and cracked a smile. Her smile was white in her golden brown face and her eyes had the same color as her skin. She really was beautiful. I could feel my throat start to swell a bit and my heart was beating faster. I looked at my watch and saw that I was tight on time. I very much wanted to see more of Maria, but I also knew that she was right and that I would have very demanding hours. In my mind at the time, I didn't have time to take any interest in women, so no point in asking for her number. Even now I cringe at how foolish and short sighted I was. So we said our goodbyes and I went to lunch with my co workers. Over the next few months, I became more and more disillusioned with my job. Now that I was there in the office, the work just wasn't as interesting as I imagined it would be. It was mostly making insignificant edits on Powerpoints at the whim of my more senior colleagues. And the hours were long. It felt like I wasn't even living anymore, just working. Often as I would lay in bed before I went to sleep, I would think about Maria. Why hadn't I just asked for her number. What was I afraid of? I imagined if they wrote a book about me that it would be perhaps the most boring book ever written. I'd much rather read a book about the man who had asked for Maria's number, maybe even asked her out on a date right then and there in the park. But that was in the past and there was no way to find her again. Now, one day I was in the office and it just became too much. I overheard a senior colleague talking about his divorce and then another discussing how he hadn't seen his kids in over a week. They had a laugh and got back to work. I was sick to my stomach. Was that the life I was working for? I told my associate that I was heading out to grab some lunch. He seemed a bit annoyed that I would leave the office rather than order in, but I didn't really care. I walked outside and went to the park and sat on the bench, the same one Maria was sitting in that summer day. I looked out at the park and thought to myself, an entire year has passed and you don't have anything to show for it. Nothing in your life has really changed. Your only new memories are from work and those all sort of blend into one. It was at that moment I saw her. She was breathtaking. It Was Maria. I waved to get her attention and she saw me and walked over. Hey, long time no see, Mr Banker. How are you? If I'm being honest, you look a bit down today. I smiled and said, just a bad day at work. Where are you headed? To a shoot? I have a bit of time to catch up, though. I'm in no rush. We caught up and I Learned all about what she had done that year. She had traveled to Europe and to Asia, met new people and saw new things. And to top it all off.

My parents stole my entire life savings to buy a retirement condo in Florida. 11:00am, banking alerts cascading down my phone. Payment failed, insufficient funds. The caterer, florist, capital deposit, all bouncing. I open my banking app. The wedding account that held $127,000 yesterday was empty. Balance zero. I called them, mom, dad, straight to voicemail. They took it, I whispered to Claire. All of it working three jobs through college. 5:00am, diner shifts, late nights, tutoring every holiday, waiting tables while friends vacationed, all for this day. For them to steal it, they see you as their retirement plan, not their daughter. Claire said, what about that family trust, the papers your dad made you sign? The memory hit me. Dad's office, pile of documents. It's for emergencies. Eliza puts you in charge if something happens to me or your mom. I'd signed without reading, trusting like a naive daughter. When dad finally picked up, his voice was laced with fake, syrupy concern. Eliza, honey, there's been a terrible financial emergency here at home. We can't make it to the wedding.

Put phone on silent. Fix my veil. I have a wedding to get to. Two days later in Santorini, my phone expl loaded. Dad's voice Frantic. Eliza, what did you do? $127,000 is missing from our retirement. Nicola took the phone. You're speaking to my wife. Lower your voice. I moved my money back. You said the trust was for emergencies. My wedding being sabotaged by my parents was an emergency.

My brother was born when doctors said my mom couldn't have more kids. They called him their miracle baby. I was 7 and suddenly invisible. For my 10th birthday, I asked to go to Dave and Buster's. I took my brother shopping for school clothes instead. Your birthday can wait, mom said. It never got rescheduled. By high school, the pattern was set. He'd break something, blame me, and I'd get grounded. He failed every class, but got a BMW for his 18th birthday. I was valedictorian and got a card. They skipped my graduation because he felt left out and needed a beach day. I stayed home during college to save money, working two jobs while finishing my degree. Every morning, my brother would jingle his B M W. Keys at me. Still taking the bus. Loser. After six months of overtime shifts, I finally had enough for a down payment. My friend's dad owned a used car dealership and cut me a deal on a blue Dodge Challenger. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. First thing I'd ever owned that my parents hadn't touched. I parked it in the driveway that night, put the keys on my dresser, and took about 50 photos. Even posted one on Instagram with the caption earned, not given. Next morning, the keys were gone. So was the car. So was my brother. He probably just borrowed it, mom said, not looking up From making his favourite breakfast. You know how boys are. He stole my car. Family doesn't steal from family. Three hours later, I heard the engine. My brother pulled up in my challenger. Except the front bumper was dragging, the passenger mirror was gone, and there was a crack spider webbing across the windshield. He tossed me the keys. Your car is junk, bro. Fell apart on the highway. You should get your money back. I stared at the damage. You crashed it. Prove it. My parents immediately sided with him. Dad actually said I should apologize for accusing him of lying. Mom suggested I let my brother borrow it whenever, since he's used to nicer cars and did you a favor by testing it. I walked in, died, pulled up my phone and called 9 1 1. I'd like to report a stolen vehicle that's just been returned damaged. My mother lunged for my phone. What are you doing? Exactly what you do if a stranger stole and crashed your car. The cops arrived in 20 minutes. My brother was smirking until I pulled up the dash cam footage I'd uploaded to the LOUD. See, I'd installed cameras the day I bought it. Not because I'm psychic, but because I park it in a neighbourhood where cars get broken into. The footage showed everything. Him hot wiring it at 3:00am, drag racing down the interstate, T boning a stop sign, laughing as he surveyed the damage, even calling his Friend to brag about teaching me a lesson. The officers watched 30 seconds before cuffing him. This is grand theft auto and reckless endangerment. One said the damage alone makes it a felony. My parents went nuclear. Mom screaming about family loyalty, dad threatening to kick me out. My brother just staring at me like he couldn't comprehend consequences existed. He's

I used to live with my best friend in college, and we heard that someone had just moved next to us after leaving a mental hospital. After a week, someone started repeatedly ringing our doorbell, and my roommate answers to a man who immediately makes her uncomfortable. Told her he cut his hand and needed a band aid, but his hands were clearly fine. She just kindly told him she couldn't help, and he goes, okay, can I measure something in your bedroom? She slammed the door shut, and thankfully he left. About two weeks went by until I woke up one morning to our doorbell constantly ringing again. I looked out into the hall and saw him through the window. I woke my roommate up and told that the Band Aid man was back, and she went out to see what he wanted. She slightly opened our door, and when she did, he instantly tried to push it open further. He asked if he could use our bathroom, and she shut and locked the door before calling the police. They took forever to get there, and by the time they did, he was gone. They couldn't do anything and told us, call them again if anything happens. Two days later, something did happen. I woke up to the sound of something thumping and thought someone was shaking off a carpet or something. When I got out of bed to see What it was, I realised it was something much, much worse. I could see him through our front window and saw he was throwing all his weight against our front door. I ran to tell my roommate to call the police, but as she did, the sound stopped. I didn't believe he had just left out of nowhere, so I started looking around our house. When I opened one window, he was hiding right in front of it. He turned and saw me and immediately went back to trying to break our door down. I could now see him and saw he was holding something. When I looked closer, I realised it was an axe. I was praying the door would hold up, but then heard the police yell at him to stop. They put him in the back of their car and told us he had apparently slashed all of our tires so we couldn't leave and waited outside our house since 3:00am. We moved out shortly after that.

Our son Ethan appeared in the doorway rubbing his sleepy eyes, still wearing the expensive new jacket I'd never seen before in my life. Mom, what's happening? Why are all of Dad's clothes sitting outside in bags? Your father forgot it was my birthday today, honey. But he certainly remembered to take you to see his ex girlfriend instead. Ethan's little face Crum fold with confusion. She said she was just Dad's old friend from college. She bought me ice cream and told me. What exactly did she tell you, baby? That maybe someday we could all live together like one big happy family. Marcus grabbed my arm desperately, his grip almost painful. You can't just destroy and tear our entire family apart over this one thing I already did. Now the courts will decide who Ethan really belongs. With his confident smirk, the same one he'd worn for years whenever I questioned his suspicious late nights, I vanished completely when he realized I wasn't the same naive woman who used to wait up for him every single night with dinner warming in the oven. Paisley, please be reasonable. We can work this whole thing out between us. Marissa honestly means absolutely nothing to me. I pulled out my phone and played the damming video again. Really? Because she apparently has dozens of videos of you two together going back 6 months, beach trips, romantic dinner dates, family. Photos with my son. How did you even, she sent it by complete accident. Meant to send it to her sister, not our old college group chat. Funny how technology works against cheater. Marcus sank heavily into the couch, burying his head in his hands. I swear I never meant for any of this to happen, but it did happen. And now you get to explain to our son why daddy lied about where they were going every single weekend. The next morning, the family court judge granted me temporary full custody. Marcus got supervised visits exactly twice a week. Six months later, Ethan asked me out of nowhere, mom, are you actually happier now? I looked at my son, really looked at him and realized he was, too. Sometimes the best birthday gift is discovering who you really married. And sometimes it's discovering who you really are when you finally stop making excuses for the people who hurt you most. The woman who used to wait up with dinner, she's gone forever. And I've never missed her for a single second.

Growing up, I never realised how poor we were and thought it was normal that we all had to sleep in the basement all winter. Our house had holes in the walls so it was the only place we could all stay warm at night. One year on Christmas Eve, my sister and I woke up to a loud bang outside and could hear people shouting at each other. My dad started to panic and ran upstairs to make sure our doors were locked. I was only four and remember sitting there crying while my mom covered my ears. We couldn't see what was going on because the window was covered in snow, but soon saw the police lights reflecting off of it. I was really scared because my dad wasn't coming back down, but a few minutes later he walked back downstairs with Santa Claus. My sister and I instantly forgot all all about the shouting and got really excited. He told us not to worry and that his sleigh had crashed into the snow outside. The shouting were just kind police officers that were helping him dig it out of the snow. He brought us presents to open and sang Christmas songs until the sirens were gone. he said he had to go back to delivering presents for the other kids. I went to sleep that night thinking I was The luckiest kid ever. But it wasn't until I was 17 that I Learned what really happened. Gang tried to break into the house across the street from mine, and a few people died right outside that window. The older man who lived next to us knew we had undoubtedly scared kids and happened to have a Santa costume. He put it on and tried to keep us calm until it was over.

I'm not an employee. As a consultant, then name your rate. I'm not available. Which was true. I had a phone interview with Drift Shade limited at two PM, Hollowate's biggest competitor.

This is sabotage. This is consequences. Jeff, I can report you for withholding company information. What information? I took my personal belongings when you terminated me. All official files remain on your servers. Those notebooks contain proprietary data. Those notebooks contain my personal work notes purchased with my own money. Check my employment contract. She hung up. Two hours later, my wife forwards me a screenshot from LinkedIn. Jessica had posted about exciting restructuring opportunities, trying to spin the disaster as strategic plan. The comments were brutal. Three former clients asking where I'd gone, two competitors offering condolences.

Thursday, my new phone at Drift Shade rang. Randy, this is Tom Chen from hollowgate. We heard you joined the team. When can we schedule that technical review? Sometimes the best revenge is simply stepping out of the way and letting people destroy themselves.

When I was 8, my dad had this weird rule about the garage. We weren't allowed in there after dark, ever. He said it was dangerous because of the tools and chemicals. But something about how he said it made me not believe him. Every night at exactly ten PM, I'd hear him go out there. The garage door would creak open, then silence for about an hour. Then he'd come back inside. I tried asking mom about it once. She just looked away and said dad needed his alone time. But kids notice things adults think they don't. Like how dad's hands were always dusty when he came back. Or how he'd sometimes have tiny cuts on his fingers. Or how he'd smell like sawdust mix with something else I couldn't name. One night when I was 11, I decided to peek. I waited until I heard the garage door closed, then snuck to the window. But the windows were covered with black paper. From the inside, I could see light coming from underneath, shadows moving, and hear this steady scraping sound, like sandpaper on wood. Over and over. I got brave and tried the side door. Once locked, I checked under the workbench outside for a spare key. I even climbed on the AC unit to look through a crack in the roof. All I could see was dad hunched over something, his back to me, working. With his hands. This went on for years. Every single night. Even Christmas. Even when he was sick. Even the night grandma died and we got the call at dinner, he still went to the garage at ten PM. By high school, I'd given up trying to figure it out. I had other things to worry about. Friends, grades, girls. Garage mystery became just another weird thing about dad. Like how he always wore the same blue flannel on Sundays. Or never ate Mayo. I left for college at 18, got a degree, got a job, got married, visited home maybe twice a year. Dad was still going to the garage every night. Mom would just shrug when I brought it up. Some things never change. Then last year, dad had a heart attack. It was bad. He survived, but barely. The doctor said he needed to take it easy. No stress, no physical work. Mom called me crying, saying dad was depressed because he couldn't go to the garage anymore. I flew home to help out. One afternoon, while dad was napping, I found his keychain on the kitchen counter. There it was, A small brass key I'd never noticed before. My hands were shaking as I walked to the garage. The lock clicked open. I push the door and stepped inside. What I saw made me freeze. The walls were covered floor to ceiling with wooden dolls. Hundreds of them. All different sizes, different faces, different clothes. Each One carved by hand with incredible detail. Some were dancing, some sitting, some playing instruments. That wasn't the part that made me cry. In the center of the garage was a workbench. On it was a half finished doll. It was a little boy, about 8 years old, wearing a backwards baseball cap and holding a toy airplane. It was me. The same age I was when dad started going to the garage. I found a notebook on the bench. Inside were pages and pages of notes. Each doll had a date and a name. Mary from the grocery store, who always smiled. Bob from work, who got laid off. Missus Chen, who lost her husband. Every doll was someone from our town who was going through a hard time. At the bottom of each entry, dad had written the same thing. Delivered. I asked mom about it that night. She finally told me the truth. Dad had been secretly making these dolls and leaving them on people doorsteps when they needed them most. No note, no explanation. Just a small wooden figure that looked like them or their loved one doing something that made them happy. She showed me letters people had written to the local paper over the years about mysterious dolls that appeared right when they needed hope. How they treasured them, how they felt, seen. Dad never wanted credit. Never wanted thanks. He just spent every night for 30 years in that garage carving comfort for Strangers. The doll of me was the only one he never finished. Mom said he started it the night I told him I was too old to play catch. He'd been adding to it ever since, changing it as I grew up. Waiting for the right moment to give it to me. He's too weak to carve now. His hands shake too much. But I go to the garage every night at ten PM. I'm not as good as him yet. My dolls are rough, uneven. But I'm learning. Last week I finished my first one. A nurse from the hospital who held Dad's hand during his worst night. I left it on her doorstep this morning. I think dad would be proud, even if he never says it out loud. I finally understood why we couldn't go in the garage after dark. It wasn't because it was dangerous. It was because some mysteries are better left unsolved. Some magic only works in secret. And some father's love in ways too beautiful for work.

So you remember you're not part of this family. While dad laughed hysterically. I'm 29. Always been the odd one out in the Peterson family. Different hair, different build, different everything. They joke about the mailman constantly. So when Sarah handed me that DNA kit with a smirk and time to prove what we all know, I wasn't even surprised. Dad was cracking up. Mom nodding like she'd been waiting years for this moment. Fine, I said, but let's make it interesting. How about we all take DNA tests, you know, for science? The room went quiet. Sarah laughed nervously. Why would we need to? Because I already took one six months ago, I said. Pulling out my phone and according to 23 and me, I have a half sister named Jessica. Been looking for her biological family. I showed them Jessica's profile. Same last name as Mom's Maiden name, same distinctive birthmark mom has on her wrist. Jessica was born nine months after Mom's business trip to Chicago in 1995. Remember that trip, mom, the one where you couldn't be reached for three days? Mom's face went white. Dad stopped laughing immediately. Oh, it gets better. I continued scrolling through my phone. Jessica wasn't the only surprise. I have three half siblings from Mom's various work conferences. I showed them photos. This is Michael from Denver, born in 1998. Ring any bells about that marketing seminar you attended? Alone. Sarah grabbed the phone. That's not possible. And here's little Emma from Portland, born in 2,001. Funny how she has the same rare eye condition as Mom. Dad's face was turning red, but not from laughter anymore. Linda, what the hell? Is this the best part? I pulled out a thick envelope from my jacket. I've been in contact with all three of them for months. They all want to meet their biological mother. In fact, they're driving here right now. Mom stood up shakily. You didn't. I did. Jessica should be here in about an hour. Michael's flying in from Denver tonight. Emma's parents are bringing her tomorrow morning for Christmas brunch. I looked at Sarah, who was still holding the DNA kit. tell me again about not being part of this family, because it looks like you're about to have a lot more family than you bargained for. Dad was staring at mom like he'd never seen her before. 26 years, Linda, 26 years of marriage and you've been lying about three children. Actually, I said, checking my messages.

My mom and I came home one night to find our new couch completely covered in claw marks. And this made her so mad she put my kitten on Facebook Marketplace. I was crying, begging her not to, but she wouldn't listen to me. I got a message from a girl the next day asking to come get her and she looked nice enough, so I gave her my address. That night I saw her car pull up, but when the door opened, it wasn't a girl. I immediately recognized him. This guy had stalked me multiple times in high school and would show up to our house before we moved. I immediately shut the door and told my mom about it. They were leaving for the night and I begged her to stay, but she didn't believe me. So now I was stuck home alone. I fell asleep crying because that was the last night I got to sleep with my cat. But about two hours later, I woke up to her jumping up on the bed. I thought she must have just heard something and tried to go back to sleep. However, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. I looked around the room and when I looked at my door, I saw it. This was the single creepiest thing I've ever seen because the same guy from earlier was now looking at me through my door, my Adrenaline instantly kicked in. I heard a really loud scream and after a second realised it was coming from me. I jumped up to shut my door, but he started pushing back. I couldn't even imagine what he was planning to do if he got inside. So I pushed as hard as I could before locking it. I had to grab my cat and climbed out my window to run to our neighbour's house. They called the police and my parents came home as quick as they could. We found where he broke our basement window to get inside and they arrested him the next day. But it was worth it because I got to keep my cat.

I taught 10th grade English and out of nowhere, one of my best students suddenly just stopped showing up. After a week, someone from our school was finally able to reach his mom and found out that him and his dad got into a car crash and his dad had died. He was out of school for two months but eventually came back. He was really struggling and always got straight A's before that. So after class one day, I told him not to worry about any of the work because he had already passed the state exam and was a good student. He was really thankful. But a few weeks later, I got called into the counselor's office. I walked in to see him sitting there with his other teachers and I soon found out he was failing their classes. They were trying to make him do all the work he missed, which probably wasn't even possible. And if he couldn't, he'd have to repeat the entire year. They checked his grades and saw he had an a in my class. One of his other teachers, who I knew didn't like me, started arguing with me, saying I can't just give him a free pass and not let him learn anything. He asked why I was called here since I wasn't even trying to teach him anything. This was all unbelievable to me. I tried to stay calm. But said, the kid's dad just fucking died. Do you really think your history class matters to him in the slightest? They both just stared at me. The counselor suddenly smiled and said, that's why I called Mister Carter here today, because I knew he'd say some things I'm not allowed to.

She'd pack my little suitcase, kiss my forehead and drive away fast. I loved it there. Aunt Sarah lived in this big house with a pool and a room just for toys. She'd let me eat ice cream for breakfast, stay up late watching cartoons, pick any movie I wanted. No rules, no bedtime, just fun. She'd take pictures of everything we did, me on the swings, me with chocolate on my face, me sleeping on the couch. Hundreds of photos every visit. I'd come home with stories about our adventures, the zoo trips, the arcade, the time she let me get three toys at the store. My friends were so jealous, they wanted an aunt like mine. Mom would listen to my stories, but her smile looked tight. She'd nod and say, that sounds nice, honey. Then she'd go quiet. But I was too happy to notice. This went on every summer until I turned 13. That year, mom said I was too old for sleepovers. Aunt Sarah called the house crying, begging to see me just one more time. Mom hung up on her. I was confused and angry. Why was she being so mean? Aunt Sarah was the best part of my summers. Twenty years later, I was helping mom move houses. In the garage, I found a box labeled Legal 2004. Inside were Court documents, custody papers, restraining orders, paid after page about a custody battle, about a woman trying to get visitation rights for a child that wasn't hers, about psychological evaluations, about supervised visits that were supposed to last two hours, not two weeks. I sat on the garage floor reading. Aunt Sarah wasn't my aunt. She was my biological mother. She'd lost custody when I was 3. Something about mental health, substance abuse, unfit living conditions. The court gave her supervised visits twice a year, but mom felt sorry for her, let her have more time. Those two weeks every summer weren't fun sleepovers. They were illegal visits mom allowed because she thought everyone deserved a second chance. I found the photos, too, the ones Aunt Sarah took, thousands of them, all organized by date and albums like evidence, like proof she was a good mother, like someday she'd use them in court to get me back. The back of one written in pen, my baby, Summer 2005. Soon I confronted mom that night. She looked exhausted. She told me Sarah called every week for 20 years asking about me. She said she almost lost custody herself for breaking the court order. She said Sarah seemed better during those visits, happy, stable, trying so hard. She said she did it because she thought I should know both mothers, even if I didn't know I had two. She said the photos were Sarah's way of holding onto something she couldn't have. I looked up Sarah online. She's living three hours away, same town, same house with the pool. Her Facebook is pub. Like. Every summer, she post old photos of a little kid eating ice cream, playing with toys, sleeping on a couch. The captions always say, missing my favourite visitor with a heart emoji. Her friends comment asking whose kid it is. She never answers. She just post another photo the next day.

I couldn't stand my son's new girlfriend. After my divorce, I'd watched him struggle through relationships with girls who treated him like an ATM. So when Maya showed up, I was ready. Designer purse, expensive highlights, checking her reflection in every surface. I saw dollar signs in her eyes. The moment she walked in, when she barely touched the lasagna I'd spent hours making, I rolled my eyes when she asked Jake about his promotion before even saying hello. I knew what she was after. My son worked at a tech startup, good money for his age. And Maya looked at him like he was her meal ticket. He started showing up more often, always during dinner, always with some story about being between jobs. Jake would pay for everything while she scrolled through shopping apps. I bit my tongue but kept track. One night she mentioned needing new tires. The next week, Jake mentioned his savings were getting low. I finally snapped when she asked to borrow his car for a job interview. Something felt wrong, so I did what any protective mom would do. I followed her. She drove straight to a nail salon and spent three hours getting a full set. No interview, just lies. I was ready to tell Jake everything, but when I got home, Maya's car was in the driveway with the hood up. Jake was teaching her how to check the oil. She had Grease on her designer jeans. Her manicure was ruined from holding the dipstick. That afternoon, Jake got called into an emergency meeting, a server crash. He'd be there all night. Maya offered to drop off his dinner. I watched her pack his favorite sandwich, extra pickles. I knew he hated mustard. Details I thought she'd never notice. Hours passed. Jake called to say he'd be even later. Maya stayed. She helped me clean the kitchen. We didn't talk much. Then around midnight, she asked if I had any old clothes. Her mom was sick. Chemo made her cold. She'd been using her unemployment checks for medical bills. The designer purse, a knockoff she bought before her mom got diagnosed. Job interview, she'd been too embarrassed to admit she got rejected before even walking in. The nail salon was her friend's shop. She was sweeping floors for cash. Jake texted at 2:00am, still at work. Maya was asleep on my couch. Her phone opened to job listings. Her search history showed budget grocery stores and cheap mechanics at shopping sites. The last text to her mom said, don't worry about rent. I'll figure it out. She started coming over during the day while Jake worked, not for dinner, to help me reorganize the garage, fix the squeaky cabinet, to teach me how to use Jake's old laptop. She never asked for anything. Three months later, Jake lost his job. The startup folded. He was devastated. I waited for Maya to disappear. Instead, she showed up with a printed spreadsheet of his expenses and three job leads she'd researched. He'd already updated his resume. That night. She told him she'd gotten a job at an accounting firm, entry level but steady. She could cover rent while he looked for something better. Jake tried to argue. She wouldn't let him. Now she owns that accounting firm, bought out her old boss last year. Jake works there, too. They have two kids who call me grandma sometimes. I watch her teaching them about money, real lessons, how to save, how to budget. Last week, she hired her mom as a receptionist. Permission now, full benefits. Maya still checks the oil in her car herself, still wears those same jeans with the grease stain, says they remind her of when everything changed. My son didn't marry a gold digger. He married pure gold. I just took a while to see the shine.

I do have enough energy for one more Trip, meet me at the car. Yay! I'm bringing my Barbies! I'm bringing my new Barbies to come play with you. Emma, I miss you so much. You were the best thing I had in my life. I will never forget you. And I'll keep that promise that we made at your grave that I will come play Barbies with you every single day. I love you so much. Mommy, when will you be back from work? I have to go see Emma again today so we can play Barbies. Yesterday was so fun with her. I was so happy I could spend time with her. Sorry, baby. I won't be able to make it home on time because of this snowstorm. But, Mommy, I made a promise to Emma that I would never miss a day. I'm so sorry, Tammy, but I can't today. Don't be sorry, Mommy. I won't break my promise to Emma. Wait, honey, what do you mean by that? Tammy? Justin, where is Tammy? I don't know. Why are you asking me? You didn't watch over your little sister. I looked over the entire house, and she's not here. And that's my problem. How? Oh, my god. I think she went to Emma's grave. Wait, how would she even be able to walk all the way over there by herself in the snow? No time for questions. Get in your car and drive to the cemetery now. Whatever. Did you find anything, Justin? I looked Around and found nothing. Oh, my god, not my Tammy! Well, actually, I did find this one thing. Two Frozen Barbies in front of Emma's Tombstone. Oh, my god, no!

My parents weren't like abusive or anything, but they were super strict. I'm talking no social media, no hanging out with friends on school nights, and my phone had to be turned in at nine PM every night. Literally medieval torture for a teenage girl. The final straw came after this huge fight about my grades. I've been struggling in math, always hated it, still do tbh and got a D on my report card. My parents flipped. They took my phone for a month, banned me from seeing my friends, and made me spend weekends doing extra math worksheets instead of anything fun. I was texting with my best friend Charlotte at school about how unfair it was and she was like just come stay with me for a few days, my parents won't care. Her family was mad chill compared to mine. Her mom let her have boys in her room with the door closed. I was jealous AF so I decided to run away. Now I wasn't completely stupid. I knew I couldn't just disappear forever. I was thinking like a 3 4 day protest to show my parents they were being unreasonable. Maybe they'd realise how much they missed me and stop being so strict. I packed a backpack with like the Absolute Essentials. Three t shirts, my favourite hoodie, a pair of jeans, some underwear, my school makeup bag, and like $43 I'd saved from Birthday money. I also took this silver necklace my grandma gave me that I thought I could maybe sell if I needed more cash. Teen logic lol. I waited until everyone was asleep, probably around 1:00am. Our house had this super creepy wooden hallway, I literally practiced walking through it for weeks before I ran away, finding exactly where to step to avoid making noise. I felt like a ninja that night, swear to god. The plan was to walk to this 24 hour convenience store about a mile away and call Charlotte to come get me. But here's where everything went sideways. Charlotte's phone was dead. Like completely off. No response. I tried calling her house phone. Yes, they still had one, but her dad answered and I panicked and hung up. So there I was, sitting outside the 7 11 at 2:00am, no ride, and starting to low key freak out. The guy working inside kept giving me weird looks through the window. I was just sitting on the curb trying to figure out what to do when this red sedan pulls up. There were two guys and a girl, probably college age. The girl rolled down her window and asked if I was okay. I must have looked pathetic AF because she immediately offered me a ride. Her name was Melissa and she seems super nice, telling me they were coming back from a party and could drop me somewhere. Now I know this sounds dumb Don't get in cars with strangers and all that. But teenage me was desperate. It was getting cold, and I figured having a girl there made it safer. Plus, Melissa had this really gentle voice and kept saying she just wanted to help. I told them I needed to get to Charlotte's house, but didn't have her exact address. Another brilliant part of my plan. The guys were talking quietly in the front seat while Melissa kept asking me questions. How old I was, why I was out so late, if my parents knew where I was. I started noticing we weren't going towards Charlotte's neighborhood at all. We were heading towards the highway when I pointed this out. The guy driving, Steve, I think, said they needed to make a quick stop first. That's when the alarm bells really started going off in my head. Melissa kept trying to keep me calm, saying they just needed to drop something off with a friend, and then they'd help me find Charlotte's house. But then the other guy, Benjamin

How's it going? Um, hi. Who's this? I can't tell you that, but I go to your school. We've never talked, but I've had a crush on you since middle school. If you had a crush on me for so long, why have we never spoken? Because I'm scared. And I don't know if you would feel the same way. Why don't we play a game? Okay. What kind of game? You have until July to figure out who I am. Is this an excuse to get me to talk to you for the whole year? Pretty much. Why not? I do need to let you know I already have a crush on a girl in my school, so don't get your hopes up. That's fine. Let's see what happens. Hey. You looked hot today. You were watching me? It's kind of weird. Rizz app respond with how could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? How could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? Wow. That actually made me feel good. At least give me clues about yourself. Why? So I can at least get a starting point on who you are. Fine. I am blonde. That doesn't help me. There are lots of blonde girls in our school. Be more specific. I have a birthmark on my neck, so I have to go check every blonde girl's neck. Ha ha. So tell me about this girl you Like her name is Violet. She's perfect. We have never spoken. Sadly. Do you know her? Violet? Oops, sorry. I do know her. Maybe when I find out who you are, you can introduce me to her. You can ask her right now and she will say yes. How can you be so sure? I'm too scared to ask her. Don't worry. She is nice. Okay. Good night, mystery girl. I'm going to get some sleep. Good night. What? I don't get a message today. Ah. Does someone miss me? In your dreams. I was just surprised how my crush since middle school hadn't messaged me today. I have a question for you. Or ask away. How could you have loved me for so long if we haven't spoken ever? You are handsome. The way you talk to people. You are such a kind soul. Polite. You make everyone laugh. You are a gentleman. I always knew you are what I always wanted. Now I really wanna know who you are. Patience. Hey. Hey. Can I admit something to you? Sure. I'm not interested in Violet anymore. Really? How come? She's beautiful. So beautiful that I was too scared to even go near her. That's the issue. She's perfect in every way. But I have fallen for someone else. Someone who I do speak to. Someone who understands me. Someone without a name or a face, but someone who loves me. The day you find out who I am, I Hope we will be together. Me too. Mystery girl. Can I confess something to you? Sure. What's up? I think it's time to tell you who I am. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

So you can get unsupervised access to kids? So a man cannot help a child without. Without being a suspect? Are you really that jaded? With perverts like you out there, you bet I am. My sister. My sister was raped, and it destroyed her. And when I was 16, she killed herself. This is what you are accusing me of? I would never.

He treated himself like a relay baton, passing himself between horses. As soon as the little horse got the postman, it switch to high gear. Speed instantly shot up to 370 and even steep, dangerous cliffs felt like flat ground. As the ace of the postal world, the man's goal was always to deliver the letter as fast as possible. But there was one thing that limited his speed, the stamina of the horse under him. So whenever the horse started slowing down, he would contact the post office ahead of him to prepare a new horse. When they heard the ace postman was on his way, a rookie horse immediately volunteered. Though inexperienced, he had a passion for the Postal Service. Seeing the little horse so eager, the boss couldn't wait to approve him. After a few friendly words of advice, the little horse, full of energy, went to the roadside, warming up and getting into the zone. Now starting the ninth set of calisthenics. March in place. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Stop! At that moment, the postman's old horse, eager to clock out, saw the little horse and quickly handed the man over like a baton. The little horse grabbed him and pressed him against his back, activating turbo mode and shooting off. Experienced old horses watching this couldn't Help but smirk. The little horse, fresh to the job, was fearless and reckless, speeding insanely fast. But he was distracted, not watching the road, and both he and the postman plunged off a cliff. Luckily, a pond below softened their fall. More fortunately, they had two and a half years of breath holding training. But the bad luck didn't stop there. Just as they resurfaced, they fell into an even deeper pool. As bubbles floated to the surface, the postman's greeting to the little horse was definitely full of gold. The little horse, thoroughly dejected, lay motionless. The engine waterlogged, but the postman had a few slick tricks up his sleeve. Fully revived, the little horse was back on his hooves, running like a beast. Until a sudden emergency break flung the postman off the cliff. He slid for five or six hundred meters before realizing something was wrong. But he stayed calm, performed an emergency stop, and spun around, riding the air back toward the little horse. One had to wonder if he and Newton shared some sort of mysterious connection. But just when things seemed to settle, the postman found himself in trouble again. The infamous bandit Jiang Yang was now on his tail. Rumor had it this Bandit could make even the mighty Nezza leave behind three pounds of lotus powder. Before robbing anyone, he had to apply sunscreen. He was a beauty fanatic, after all. Despite his small stature of only half a meter, his Horse under him was no slouch. The height of two and a half meters, he looked down on every preschooler. The postman sensed danger and quickly turned. He saw the bandit closing in fast, so he slammed the brakes, using the little horse's cover to prepare for a one on one showdown. But the little horse, realising something was off, bolted behind the postman. No matter what the man commanded, he just wouldn't listen. After all, he was just a horse. The man gave up trying to order him around and decided to use reason. Fists are the real answer. A saying that proved true. But before he could fight back, he locked eyes with the bandit, awkwardly smiling and politely nodding. Then he turned and ran. The little horse, now fully awake, followed closely. To their surprise, they reached a perfect synchronization, racing together powerfully, shaking off the bandit and charging into the final station. The Bandit, now headed straight for the iron gate, slammed on the brakes in panic, throwing out a two room apartment in the process. Finally, the postman delivered the letter. But just as he did, he was stunned to see a little elf pop out of the bag.

I was on Facetime at 1:00am with my girlfriend when my mom burst through my door without knocking, finding me mid laugh with Nadine on my phone screen. Are you serious right now? Mom shrieked, grabbing my phone while Nadine's confused face disappeared into darkness. This is completely inappropriate. It's a school night. Dad appeared behind her, shaking his head like I committed some federal crime. They didn't care that I had straight A's, that this was my chance with my crush, or that these late night calls were the only thing keeping her interested in me. You're 16. You don't need to be talking to girls at all hours. It was insane. Complete device lockdown after 9 p m. Phone physically placed in their bedroom every night. Wi-Fi router programmed to kill my connection. Even my laptop taken away just in case. Mom installed one of those parental control apps that sent her alerts if I even touched any device after curfew. Healthy boundaries, she kept saying, showing me some article about teenage sleep schedule she'd found on Facebook. That first night without talking to Nadine was torture. I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, wondering if she thought I was ignoring her, if she was upset, if she think I didn't care anymore. My parents did three separate checks that night, opening my door to make sure I was in bed, sleep device less, and alone. The second night, I Couldn't handle it. Nadine had texted me 17 times during school asking if I was okay if we were breaking up. Then I got an idea. I remembered my iPhone 6 buried in my closet. Cracked screen, terrible battery. But it could work. After my parents 9:30 p m. Check, I waited until 10:15 to be safe, then pulled out the hidden phone. Nadine's face appeared, pixelated and laggy, but she was smiling. I thought your parents murdered you, she whispered, and I had to bite my tongue to keep from laughing. We developed an intricate system based on my parents patterns. Mom always did checks throughout the night. I became a master of deception. The moment I heard her footsteps on the stairs. I'd whisper, she's coming to Nadine, kill the screen, slide the phone under my pillow, close my eyes, and control every micro expression on my face. The hardest part was when mom would just stand there staring, and I'd have to remain completely stone faced, breathing steady and deep, like I was truly asleep. Once mom actually walked over and stood directly over me for a full minute. It was torture. Then, weirdly, Nadine asked me, babe, are you okay? You keep coughing. I hadn't even noticed I was doing it, but she was right. My throat felt scratchy and weird. Maybe you're getting sick, she suggested. But. And I smelled it. Something sharp and chemical cutting through my room. Hold on, I whispered. And when I opened my bedroom door. My stomach dropped. Gray smoke was flowing along the hallway ceiling like a river, getting thicker by the second, pouring from the direct

Wait until they see what a year in China taught me. I start seventh grade with a renewed boost of confidence after spending a year with my grandparents in China. Walking into the school, I spot my worst nightmare. I knew this moment would come eventually. There's Shane, still the same 5 feet 8 inches tower of teenage cruelty, flanked by his usual suspects, Minion 1 and Minion 2. Such loyal followers. I'm still only 5 feet 2 inches and probably look exactly the same to them. Same. See? Brown hair, same hand me down clothes, same kid they used to stuff into lockers every Tuesday. Like clockwork. Well, well, well, look who's back, Shane announces loud enough for half the hallway to hear. We missed our little toilet bowl cleaner. Minion one actually claps his hands together like he's genuinely excited. Dude, remember when we made him eat that sandwich off the bathroom floor? They're laughing about it like it's their fondest memory. And I feel that familiar burning in my chest. Except this time it feels different. Controlled. My grandfather's voice echoes in my head. Anger is fire. You can let it burn you, or you can forge steel with it. Minion two steps closer, invading my personal space. Hope you didn't get too comfortable wherever you went, because nothing's changed here. He shoves my shoulder, testing to see if I'll react the same way I used to. Cowering and apologizing instead, I steady myself and look him directly in the eye. Everything's changed, I say quietly, but Minion 2 just laughs and walks away with his friends. Same scared little mouse. Shane calls over his shoulder. See you in P E. Bathroom, boy. P E. Class arrives like a death sentence, and of course coach pairs us up for defensive exercises, which basically his excuse to let kids beat each other up legally. Shane immediately volunteers to be my partner, grinning like Christmas morning. This is going to be fun! He tells Minion 1 and Minion 2, who are partnered nearby. I've been saving up a year's worth of frustration. He starts small, an accidental elbow to my ribs during warm UPS. Oops! Sorry Mouse Boy, didn't mean to hurt you. When I tell him I'm not weak anymore, he literally doubles over laughing. Not weak? You're the same 70 pound scarecrow who cried when I gave you a wedgie! That's when he crosses the line. During partner exercises, he's supposed to hold the punching pad steady, but instead he keeps jerking it away so my punches miss and I stumble forward. Maybe if you ate some actual food instead of whatever they feed mice. The rage is building in my chest, but I hear Grandpa's training. The river that moves mountains doesn't rage. It flows with purpose. Coach steps away to help another student with their form, and that's when Shane decides to get Creative. Minion 1 comes and hands Shane a bucket, which he dumps over my head. Water splashes down, soaking my clothes. Here you go, mouse boy, you looked a bit thirsty. Minion 1 and Minion 2 are recording with their phones now, probably planning to post it on social media. I'm dripping wet and Shane gets in my face, but still I hold back. Then he spots my friend Jace across the gym and smiles. Shane's now

Then Rosalie's mom got diagnosed with Lupus and Blake didn't even hesitate. He switched to night shifts at his accounting firm so he could drive her mom to treatments during the day. He even sold his beloved motorcycle, the one he'd rebuilt with his dad, just to over the copays when Rosalie's family hit their insurance limit. While the rest of us were complaining about meeting our girlfriend's parents once a month, Blake was at every single family dinner, helping Rosalie's mother cook, helping her dad fix the roof, and teaching her little brother to drive. Three years in, Blake proposed. He got down on one knee at her favorite restaurant with her whole family there with her grandmother's ring he'd personally restored and gave This speech about how she saved him from being a workaholic with no purpose. Whole restaurant started clapping. Rosalie was crying so hard she could barely say yes. The wedding planning was insane. Blake handled everything. She got stressed about vendor calls, seating arrangements, dealing with her crazy aunt who demanded vegan options for everyone. The day finally came. It was a beautiful beach and packed with 300 guests. Rosalie looked incredible walking down that aisle. Her dad tearing up next to her and Blake standing at the altar with tears already running down his face. The efficient Blake's best friend went through all the traditional stuff, the readings, the vows. Rosalie went first and by the end, everyone was dabbing their eyes with tears. Then came the big moment. Do you, Blake, take Rosalie to be your lawfully wedded wife? The whole beach was silent. Everyone waiting for that enthusiastic yes we all expected. Blake looked at Rosalie for what felt like forever. Then he took a deep breath and said, clear as day. Two hours ago, I would have hoisted you up in the air and screamed yes, but now you disgust me and I never want to see you again in my life. He turned and walked away. Rosalie's face went from confused to horrified in about two seconds. Literally collapsed right there in her wedding dress. The best friend stood there with his mouth open. Blake's mom started running after him, screaming his name. Rosalie's bridesmaids. Rushed to her, trying to get her to breathe. The whole beach erupted. People were standing up shouting, asking what the hell just happened. Blake just kept walking, got to the car park where a cab was waiting for him and drove off. Nobody could make sense of it. His groomsmen were blowing up his phone, getting nothing. Rosalie had to be sedated.

Monica and I were getting married in 10 weeks. I was signing our wedding venue contract when she stopped me. We should date other people before we get married. The pen fell out of my hand. I laughed because I thought she was joking. I'm serious. It will make us stronger. She showed me an article on her phone about open relationships. She had saved it two months ago. Two months? She'd been planning this while I was planning our honeymoon. Her phone kept buzzing with texts. She grabbed it and smiled at whatever she was reading. She said we needed to explore ourselves before getting married. She said we'd be more confident in our choice. She even mentioned that her best friend Jenna, never took risks and had a boring life. The whole time she was talking, her phone kept lighting up with messages. Kept checking them while talking to me. Something was wrong here. Fine. If you think dating others will help us, let's do it. Her face lit up completely. She looked like she'd won something big. She immediately started texting someone back really fast. I could hear her nails clicking on the phone screen. She thought I would just wait at home while she dated other people. She had no idea what was about to happen. What? The first date night came. Monica spent three hours getting ready. She wore a brand new black dress she'd bought Just for tonight. Her coworker Kyle picked her up, and she practically ran to his car. Then Jenna called and asked if I wanted to get dinner. Monica said you guys are opening things up. She said quietly, yeah, she's with Kyle right now. Jenna went silent for a long time. I knew something was happening with them. At dinner, Jenna barely touched her food. Monica's been lying to me, too, she said. Remember her work conference last month? She never went. Her hands were shaking. How do you know? I saw her location on Find My Friends. She was at Kyle's apartment the whole weekend. When I asked her about the conference, she gave me all these fake details about sessions she attended. I reached over and touched her hand. She didn't pull away. We should keep this between us, I said. Don't tell anyone about the open relationship. Let Monica think everything's working perfectly. Jenna nodded. We need to document everything she's done. Get evidence. We were both angry and hurt. This was about justice. That night, I heard everything through our bedroom wall. Monica had brought Kyle back to our apartment. Every sound, every word, everything. She was completely oblivious that I could hear them. I texted Jenna, can I come over? Twenty minutes later, I was on her couch while she made us tea. She doesn't even realize you can hear, Jenna said about the noises. She's too caught up in Kyle to think about anything. Else, we spent hours planning how to expose Monica's lies. When I left at 4 a m, she gave me her spare key. In case you need to escape again. After that first week, Jenna and I met daily to collect evidence. Screenshots of Monica's fake conference receipts, photos from Kyle's social media that proved her lies. She'd bring me lunch when I forgot to eat during our planning sessions. Two sugars. No.

Dinner was painfully awkward. It had been two years since mom left, and my dad's girlfriend, Britt, had tried too hard to impress us, making Dinosaur nuggets and smiley face Mac and cheese like we were five. My brother flipped his plate and glared at her. First you try to take dad away, and now you're bribing us with nuggets? He asked coldly. Colton! Dad yelled. Britt smiled. You're right. Next time I'll add spaghetti, she joked. Table fell silent. Dad coughed awkwardly and stood up to take a call. That's when Brit leaned forward and looked at me and my siblings with a serious expression. Look, I know this is weird, she said. What will it take for you guys to actually like me? My older brother leaned forward, too, eyeing her down, and said in his toughest 13 year old voice, do everything we say for one month. Brit didn't even hesitate. Deal. What's first? What she didn't know was that my brother was already prepared to go to war with her. And what we didn't know was that Brit was prepared, too. My brother announced the first impossible challenge. Best us at every video game we own. I knew he'd start here. Colton was undefeated at Fortnite in our entire school, but Brit showed up the next day, having studied YouTube tutorials all night. She destroyed him five rounds straight, then did the floss dance over His defeated character. My little sister innocently cheered, while my brother insisted it didn't count that he was just warming up. Best of 10, he said, and she won eight out of 10. When my brother looked sad, she showed him the trick she Learned. That way you'll destroy everyone else. He winked. The next challenge was pure physical. Old people can't do obstacle courses. My brother grinned, building one in the backyard with everything from tire runs to rope climbs. But when Brit showed up in full Crossfit gear, we knew we were done for. She ended up beating my brother's record by 30 seconds. Now do it backwards! He demanded. She did it backwards. Now blindfolded. I saw my brother mouth what the heck? When she actually did it blindfolded, using only our shouted directions. Honestly, we were impressed. Is that all you got? She teased. This week you have to pick us up from school instead of dad, but you gotta wear embarrassing costumes. And she did. Turns out Brit was a retired cosplayer. She showed up to school in an Optimus Prime costume, then a fully geared up attack on Titan costume, and a bunch more insane outfits. My friends kept saying, your mom's cool, don't you dare smile! My brother hissed at me. I'm not! I protested. I totally was! The endurance challenge was my brother's last stand, an anime Marathon of one piece to see who could stay awake. My sister fell asleep on Brit's shoulder around our six. Colton and I crashed. After 14 hours, Brit paused the show and covered us all with blankets. She carried my sister to bed and took off her shoes. She tucked me in on the couch, whispering

My best friend, Trent, paced around the room nervously. What do I do? I think our roommate is in love with me, he muttered. I bursted into laughter. Gemma? I highly doubt it, I said. Our roommates, Gemma and Ali, definitely hadn't shown they were interested in Trent at all. From what I'd seen, Gemma was naturally friendly and Ali was quiet and closed off. But Trent insisted. He pushed a crumpled piece of paper to my chest, laughing, read it and weep. I scanned through the paper that definitely very clearly stated my dazzling Trent, and I was shocked. He was right. Someone had a huge crush on him. Are you sure it's Gemma? I asked. Trent nodded and explained how there had been obvious signs. He offered me coffee when I came over. He said, that's basically asking me out. I reminded him she offered everyone coffee, but she laughed at all my jokes. Then she asked about my weekend plans. That's basically girl code for checking if I'm single, Or she's just asking about your weekend plans like a normal person, I suggested. Then he pulled out actual evidence, a poem on the kitchen counter with romantic lines like brown eyes sweeter than honey and a laugh that makes Monday mornings bearable. That's totally me, he yelled. I shrugged. I don't see it, I joked. He rolled his eyes. And haven't you noticed every time I visit There's always a gift waiting for me. Yeah, I remember that. A box of his favorite brand of herbal tea that no one else drank showed up on his table the day we were out, along with a bookmark with a quote from a movie he mentioned liking and a stress ball that showed up right before his big job interview. Trent had spent weeks building up the courage to talk to Gemma about it, waiting for that one sure sign that Gemma really felt that way about, about him. Then that sign arrived tonight. Trent had stayed late to help me with a project when we heard singing through the walls. One of the girls had been singing Taylor Swift's You Belong With Me in the most angelic voice. Then we heard it. She actually sang his name, adding Trent right into the lyrics. Trent jumped off the couch like he'd been electrocuted. I told you she likes me, he half whispered. He decided right then he was going to confess his feelings. Thanks, too. The next day he showed up at our apartment with a bouquet of roses and a poem he wrote on his own. Trent nervously walked over to Gemma, who was chilling on the couch watching Netflix. He looked up at the flowers and smiled. Wow, nice flowers. You look great, she said, calm and friendly like always. Trent cleared his throat. I know about the poems and the gifts and the song. Gemma's smile. Turned into confusion. Trent, what is this? What's going on? Gemma stared at Trent for a long moment. Wait, are you talking?

After telling us that she had mandatory district training for three days starting Monday, my English teacher pointed at me and announced, you'll be teaching the Shakespeare unit while I'm gone since you actually understand the material, unlike everyone else who thinks the movie counts as reading. I stared at her in complete disbelief. Shouldn't we have a substitute teacher? Sure, for this? She shuffled papers, avoiding eye contact because she definitely knew this was wrong. Substitutes are incompetent and I don't have time to train someone on my specific curriculum. I pushed back immediately, but I'm not trained either, and I'm literally a student. She was already halfway out the door, clutching her tote bag. Just follow the lesson plan and make them understand Romeo and Juliet, since there's a test when I get back, have a great weekend. Goodbye. She practically ran from the room before I could protest further. And suddenly I understood exactly how badly this would backfire. Monday morning, I walked into class dragging a suitcase full of zombie makeup and fake blood. We're doing Romeo and Juliet Love in the time of zombies where the Montagues are zombie hunters and the Capulet are secretly infected. Jackson volunteered for Romeo and I told him his character collected zombie teeth as trophies. Sophia got Juliet, who was slowly turning but fighting it for love. We rewrote the balcony scene at the quarantine breach. But soft what light or yonder window breaks, it is the east and Juliet hasn't eaten anyone yet. Jackson delivered while Sophia not on her own arm. For practice, the nurse became a scientist and Friar Lawrence ran an underground zombie shelter. By lunch, everyone had memorized more Shakespeare then they had all semester. Tuesday we created hazmat suits from garbage bags for the Montagues and painted decay on the capsules with whiteout and permanent markers. The party scene became Romeo discovering Juliet wasn't quite human when she tried to bite him during their first kiss. She literally tried to eat your face and you're still into her, someone shouted as Mercutio, who believed the government created the virus. Love conquers all, even the undead, Jackson replied, while Sophia perfected her zombie twitch by watching possum videos. The janitor walked in and saw 30 students covered in fake blood, staging what looked like a biohazard event and immediately left, muttering about his paycheck. Wednesday got completely out of control when I invited other classes to watch without permission. The fight scene turned into Mercurio getting infected while Romeo had to decide whether to kill his best friend before he turned. We used pool noodles as weapons and ketchup packets for blood, which exploded everywhere, coating walls and ceiling and red slatter. A plague on both your houses became. I'm literally plagued by both your houses and it's highly contagious. While the infected Mercurio chased students down the hallway, moaning about Government conspiracies and demanding brains. The cafeteria staff locked their doors when they saw him coming and someone pulled the fire alarm thinking there was an actual emergency happening. The principal arrived after getting six emergency calls about a possible biohazard in the English wing. Plus reports that student.

So I made sure he saw exactly how much I didn't need him. Uncle Wayne was worth millions but lived like a miser, constantly testing our family to see who was worthy of his money. Every holiday was an audition where cousins would compete for his approval like desperate contestants on a reality show. I leaving everything to whoever proves they don't need it, he'd announce at family dinners while everyone kissed his ass and hung on his every word. My cousins would bring him expensive gifts they couldn't afford, offer to clean his house for free, practically beg for his attention and validation. They'd research his interests and pretend to share his hobbies. My cousin Kyle even switched his major to business because Uncle Wayne mentioned he respected entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, I brought nothing and sat in the corner reading a book, completely disinterested in his little power games. Grace doesn't seem to care about family, he'd say loud enough for me to hear. Testing to see if I'd scramble for his approval like the others. You're right, I'd reply without looking up from my book. I don't care about your money either. This always made him pause. While my cousins were falling over themselves to prove their worth, I was actively proving my indifference. While they fought over who could drive him to appointments and grocery shop for him, I got a second job and Started saving every penny. While they argued about his will, I was building my own future. When they'd ask why I never visited Uncle Wayne, I'd say, as plenty of volunteers, I found his manipulation disgusting. Watching grown adults debase themselves for money made me sick. I'd rather be broke with dignity than rich through desperation. My cousins thought I was crazy. Don't you want financial security? Anna would ask. I'm setting myself up without begging, I'd tell her. While they spent their weekends doing his yard work and running his errands, I was working overtime and taking online courses to improve my skills. While they were buying him birthday presents and Christmas gifts, I was investing in my education and building an emergency fund. The dynamic was fascinating to watch. The more desperate they became for his approval, the more he seemed to enjoy withholding it. The more I ignored him, the more curious he became about me. At family gatherings, he'd try to bait me into conversations about money and success. I'd give polite, brief responses and go back to whatever I was doing. I wasn't rude, but I wasn't performing for him either. Grace, what are your career plans? He'd ask in front of everyone. Working on it, I'd say, simply not elaborating. This drove him crazy because he couldn't figure out my angle. Everyone else was transparent in their attempts to impress him, but I genuinely didn't seem to care about his opinion or his money. The day when did you stop trusting the fun parent. My daughter and her best friend are besties for life. One time I asked my daughter, Maggie, 8, if she wanted to get married. And she said, Mommy, I'm already married to Stacy. Greg, Stacy's dad, was the fun parent who built blanket forts until midnight and made pancakes shaped like their initials. Maggie literally counted down days until her next sleepover there. But then the next invitation came and Maggie said she was too tired, which seemed odd for a kid who never stopped moving. The following week, I found Stacy's mom's invite about Saturday's sleepover crumpled in Maggie's backpack hidden under her library books. When I asked about it, she mumbled something about forgetting and wouldn't look at me. That same day, I found a camera in her bag, one of those expensive digital ones. And when I asked where it came from, she froze. It's for a class project, mom. For what class? I don't know. Just leave me alone, she screamed. It was the first time she had ever raised her voice in weeks. Maggie went from my little tomboy who lived in Dinosaur shirts and thought brushing her hair was optional to suddenly begging for pedicures, asking if she was pretty enough, obsessing over scented lotions at target. She stood in front of the mirror for 20 minutes one morning just staring at herself. And when I asked what she was doing, she said, making Sure I look right. He was 8 when Stacy's mom called about the upcoming sleepover. That Friday, Maggie overheard and started crying so hard she couldn't breathe. Just ran to her room and slammed the door. The next Monday at school pickup changed everything. Greg waved from across the parking lot like always, calling out, hey, Maggie. And my daughter grabbed my hand so tight her nails dug in, hiding her whole body behind me. Her entire body was shaking in the car. She kept checking the mirrors to make sure his car wasn't behind us. She wouldn't wear her favorite Dinosaur shirt anymore, the one she'd worn twice a week for months, saying she needed to look grown up because she was almost an adult. I also noticed she suddenly had money, random dollars in her piggy bank. She couldn't explain. I found it, she'd say. But none of it made sense because an eight year old doesn't just find $50. When my husband and I gently asked if Mister Greg had done something, she shook her head so violently I thought she'd hurt her neck. She just kept saying no, no, no, over and over. More things kept appearing in her room, a magnifying mirror I'd never bought. Concealer from a brand I don't even use so much. Nail polish she could open a salon. And these homemade friendship bracelets, but weird ones with be.

Kimberly stumbled into my office sobbing so hard her whole body shook. Miss Moreno, I'm pregnant, she choked out. My parents will kill me. They'll disown me. I can't tell them. I moved my chair closer and lowered my voice. Breathe with me, in through your nose, out through your mouth. How far along? Four months, she whispered, clutching her oversized hoodie. I kept hoping the tests were wrong. She glanced at her stomach as if it might answer for her. I asked if she'd seen a doctor. She shook her head hard. They'll tell my parents I'm on their insurance. They check every explanation of benefits. They'll know. I slid pamphlets across my desk, adoption resources, local women's clinics and parenthood, and explained options in a neutral voice, pressing the importance of medical care. There are confidential clinics, I said. Sliding scale. No insurance needed. She pushed the papers away. They track my phone. They check my bank. If I'm not where I'm supposed to be, they call the school. Her fear was practical, obsessive. I asked about the father. James is at MIT, she said, voice breaking. He doesn't even know. I documented the conversation, scheduled a follow up and gave her my number. She left clutching two pamphlets. Like talismans, felt uneasy, very aware of how fragile things could go wrong. Kimberly started coming in twice a week. Each visit showed her unraveling. Her face, thinned cheekbones. Sharpened with baggy hoodies, her jeans hung loose despite the roundness at her middle. Are you eating enough, I asked once. I'm fine, she insisted, fingers trembling. Just morning sickness. But morning sickness at 4 in the afternoon, irritability and weight loss and pregnancy set off alarms in my head. I warned her about malnutrition, about risks to the fetus. At our fifth session, she said, I've been researching. Her eyes avoided mine. There are clinics that understand my situation. I explained the danger of unlicensed providers and back alley procedure and marked reputable clinics on the pamphlet. She took them, but I can see she'd already made up her mind. Two weeks later, she arrived frantic. Her hoodie couldn't hide the belly anymore. She looked six months along and exhausted. I found a place, she said. They'll help me and my parents will never know. When I asked for details, name, location, licensing, she deflected, muttering about privacy and special circumstances. I documented everything, appearance, evasive answers, and the clinic she wouldn't name. Let me drive you to Planned Parenthood, I begged. They have counselors, she snapped. I said, I'm fine. Stood up unsteadily and left. She stopped coming. I checked with t. She was still in class, but increasingly unwell.

I worked in marketing for a long time at Nike across American football, American basketball, Nike women. You wanna know some of the craziest differences between athletes at the highest level in America and athletes on these global stages? In soccer, these Fools will actually wear the key colorway of all the latest soccer cleats and boots. I'm American. We call cleats. The key colorway from a company is usually a bright color that they've LED with to try to stand out amongst the crowd. Nike's using this bright orange, a bright orange, and there's this pink here. Puma had this purple colorway. Adidas has this blue, red, white, different combo. And in America, it's like pulling teeth trying to get American athletes to wear the latest and greatest in innovation in footwear. In American football, the favorite cleat of most football players is literally cleat made in 2014 and they go on eBay for like 500 bucks. Pros will literally wear them at the highest level.

They sponsored the Cubs were just making inroads everywhere. But the real business success was ignoring New York and LA and basically picking the other 48 flyover states that Nike and Adidas did not care about at all. They embrace hunting and rural lifestyle and youth sports and went so hard on their DNA which was this click clack, really Agro, really focused in football. While Nike and Adidas strategy had always been going after teen athletes, under armour just went younger. They went after the 10 year old athlete. And every kid from 5 to 10 years old was wearing under armour. Because you know what? Eventually 10 year olds become 13 year olds and 17 year olds and 25 year old. And I'm glad they were be.

Last year, Nico played for Tennessee, which is one of the best teams in the SEC. And this guy actually LED Tennessee to the College Football Playoffs. They were 10 and 3, and they lost in the first round. But at the end of last season, Nico wanted about $4 million in nil money, even though he was already slatted to make about 2.2 million a year. And mind you, this kid had Tennessee by the balls. He was gonna be their starting quarterback for the next two years. But for whatever reason, he transferred to UCLA out of the SEC for less money. And as you can imagine, Tennessee fans were pissed. So Nico thought the grass would be a whole lot greener at UCLA. Well, come to find out, it's not, because UCLA is now 0 and 3 to start the season. And they got blown out last night by New Mexico, who they paid $1.2 million to play. Which was at home, by the way. And this is what the crowd looked like. There's nobody there. Meanwhile.

Malavea had a holdout because he wanted more nil money. And it was just reported this morning that Tennessee is gonna be moving on from the guy. So basically, here's what's happening. This year, Nico was slated to make $2.4 million from Tennessee's collective, but apparently that wasn't enough for Nico and he saw Carson Beck go from Georgia to Florida and he's getting 4 million. So basically stopped showing up to practice and meetings and was holding out hoping that Tennessee would give him $4 million. Long story short, Tennessee said no. I mean, to be fair, Nico, like Tennessee's mascot is the volunteers. He kind of knew what you signed up for. All jokes aside, though, this is kind of an insane move. And to me, the only logical explanation behind this is that Nico's camp just thinks he's not gonna succeed in the NFL, so they're trying to get him as much money as possible, right?

Now, for those of you who don't know football rules, this little white line here is reserved for the referee and the referee only. And right here is where all the players should be. And when a big play like this happens, the ref is running down that white strip. And a lot of the time, if players get close to that white strip, the refs will issue a warning to the sideline. But this time, Parker got in the way of the ref and actually made contact with him, which caused the ref to throw a penalty flag on Parker Jones in the sideline, costing Georgia 15 yards. And now millions of people are blaming this guy for Georgia losing the Sugar Bowl. They're using him as a scapegoat to just cope with the fact that Georgia didn't play well enough to win the game.

But come to find out that this tradition all started in college when Pat got Brittany a dog and named it steel after the Steelers.

However, it was just reported by ON 3 nil that Michigan is prepared to give Bryce an offer that he cannot refuse. In that offer being a four year, ten and a half million dollar deal to play football at Michigan. Now, just for reference here, Brock Purdy, he got paid $3.7 million for his rookie contract, both for four years. Now, nobody knows what the hell is gonna happen, right? But this morning, Bryce posted this picture to his story. And the guy in this picture is Philip Wright, who used to be committed to Michigan, but is now committed to LSU. Now, to me, this seems like he's gonna stay at LSU, but I have no idea. But the fact of the matter is that recruiting in 2024 is insane. But now it's just got me wondering how much LSU offered him. And will he

Does this look like the stance of a running back who's gonna make the next three hours of your life living hell? Like if I didn't know who this man was and I walked onto that field, I'd thought I would be in for a cake walk that day. But he does this every single play. He's just standing there menacingly, just completely flat footed, hands down by his sides, not giving a single fuck, but just thinking inside of his brain how he's about to absolutely decimate that defense. So again, pre snap, the guy looks like this, not very intimidating and then he just proceeds to do shit like this, just completely running all over the field, jumping over guys, breaking tackles, stiff arming dudes into the shadow realm, just doing everything possible to make the defense look like they're 12 year olds. And next thing you know, he's five yards ahead of you about to run into the end zone. I mean, just look at this dude's face right here. A guy is like, who the fuck is this dude and how did he get past me, bro?

We all remember a couple weeks ago when Michigan upset Ohio State right in. That game was followed by Michigan planting a flag at Ohio State, which then caused all this chaos, and it was just badness. Well, it was just announced yesterday that this guy has had enough of the flag planting at Ohio Stadium. So this guy right here is Josh Williams, and he's a state representative for Ohio. And yesterday he announced a new Bill for the state of Ohio that would make flag planting in Ohio a felony. This man is so tired of Ohio State losing and the other team planting a flag at midfield that he wants to make it illegal and a felony nonetheless. Thanks, Baker Mayfield. The Bill would prohibit planting a flagpole and flag in the center of the Ohio Stadium football field the day of a college football game. And to name this act the O H I O. Sportsmanship Act. Notably, this Bill specifically references Ohio Stadium, so would not include flag.

So over the weekend, this story went viral on X where this guy alleges that Steve Smith has been railing his wife. And this is the wife in question. Now, this wife here is in the Ravens marching band and that's how they met. Apparently. I would imagine Steve met this woman when he was dressed up in the marching band for the Ravens for some reason. But in this viral post, the guy attached a video of him allegedly talking to Steve and he said, hey, Steve, I know you're, hmm, my wife. And Steve goes, sorry. Now, of course, that pissed the husband off and he started going on a tirade cause Steve here is known as a family man. He's got a wife and 4 kids, always with his wife at events. He's a family guy. Well, it turns out that Steve is a freak. The wife here had Steve disguised as 3 in her phone. And here's just one text thread between the two of them, allegedly.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys.

That way everyone could get acclimated, they can get in a routine and we can start practicing over there for our game on Saturday. Well, we got bad news. This Hawaii football reporter said, Delaware State spokeswoman confirms Hornets missed today's ten and a/2 hour flight to Honolulu because of a bus snafu the JFK airport. And clearly nobody has any idea what the hell is going on or what they're gonna do because the spokesperson said we're working on a plane. Now I can't even begin to imagine how hard it is to find a plane that will fit an entire team of football players going to Hawaii of all places. Now, as of this picture, Hawaii is favored by 39 points. And with all of this happening, I'm only going to assume that Hawaii.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys and if you want to know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by four and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to Cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of him. But what he did today takes the care. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man Dak Prescott who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt and then third string they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt and although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line and in Cooper's contract there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he Sits at 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays.

So this man right here is Shamar Stuart from Texas A&M. He was drafted 17th overall by the Bengals this year. But Shamar here is the only first round pick to not have signed his rookie contract yet because the Bengals are trying to shaft him. this dispute happening with Shamar in the Bengals isn't about money. He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing is cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term. They can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team, and he's actually been practicing with Texas A M. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL, because one, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible, but not like.

And it was just, well, it was just announced yesterday that this guy has had enough of the flag planting at Ohio Stadium. So this guy right here is Josh Williams and he's a state representative for Ohio. And yesterday he announced a new Bill for the state of Ohio that would make flag planting in Ohio a felony. This man is so tired of Ohio State losing and the other team planting a flag at midfield that he wants to make it illegal and a felony nonetheless. Thanks, Baker Mayfield. The Bill would prohibit planting a flagpole and flag in the center of the Ohio Stadium football field on the day of a college football game. And to name this act the O. H. I. O. Sportsmanship Act. Notably, this Bill specifically references Ohio Stadium, so would not include flag.

In soccer, these Fools will actually wear the key colorway of all the latest soccer cleats and boots. I'm American. We call cleats. The key colorway from a company is usually a bright color that they've LED with to try to stand out amongst the crowd. Nike's using this bright orange, a bright orange and there's this pink here. Puma had this purple colorway. Adidas has this blue, red, white, different combo. And in America, it's like pulling teeth trying to get American athletes to wear the latest and greatest and innovation in footwear.

So this fellow right here, his name is David Booth and David here founded a hedge fund that just so happens to manage about a trillion dollars. And David's been thinking a lot recently, you know what, I love Kansas so much, I'm gonna give them $300 million, the single largest donation in college sports history. In fact, he's such a big donor for Kansas, they renamed their stadium after the guy. They call it the booth. And for anyone who's saying that this is just for new locker rooms or new stadiums, it's full of shit. Yes, Kansas said they're gonna use 75 million of that 300 to finish the stadium, but the other 225 million, where do you think that's going? This is an NFL war chest that they're gonna be using for new talent. And the recruiting and transfer portal is gonna look like this next year because now Kansas has a fuck ton of money and nowhere to spend it.

Well, it was just announced yesterday that this guy has had enough of the flag planting at Ohio Stadium. So this guy right here is Josh Williams, and he's a state representative for Ohio. And yesterday he announced a new Bill for the state of Ohio that would make flag planting in Ohio a felony. This man is so tired of Ohio State losing and the other team planting a flag at midfield that he wants to make it illegal and a felony nonetheless. Thanks, Baker Mayfield. The Bill would prohibit planting a flagpole and flag in the center of the Ohio Stadium football field on the day of a college football game. And to name this act the O H I O. Sportsmanship Act. Notably, this Bill specifically references Ohio Stadium, so would not include flag planting at all.

So the man you're looking at right here, his name is Parker Jones and he's a walk on red shirt sophomore for Georgia football. And yesterday, Georgia was playing Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl. Now, during this game, Georgia had a pretty big play, the guys running down the sidelines. But guess who was celebrating while he was running down the sidelines? Parker Jones. Now, for those of you who don't know football rules, this little white line here is reserved for the referee and the referee only. And right here is where all the players should be. And when a big play like this happens, the ref is running down that white strip. And a lot of the time if players get close to that white strip, the refs will issue a warning to the sideline. But this time, Parker got in the way of the ref and actually made contact with him, which caused the ref to throw a penalty flag on Parker Jones in the sideline, costing Georgia 15 yards. And now millions of people are blaming this guy for Georgia losing the Sugar Bowl. They're using him as a scapegoat to just cope with the fact that Georgia didn't play well enough to win the game. Was it stupid? Absolutely. You gotta be better than that. But I mean, you can't tell me.

So this here is Alvin Henderson and he is a four star recruit out of Elba, Alabama. Now he's committed to Auburn. And this man is 5 foot 9, 200 pounds and a running back. So obviously last night, it's early in the season, Friday Night Lights, Alvin takes the field to win this game versus Mackenzie. Alvin had 40 carries for 435 fucking yards and 10 touchdowns. 435 yards and 10 touchdowns. Some kids don't even do this in a season. If I started NCAA 25 and put Georgia versus Toledo, I don't think I could do this. So seeing that he had 40 carries for 435 yards and 10 touchdowns, you're probably like, damn, they must have beat the shit out of the other team, right? Yeah. So, uh, no, they lost the game. The final score of this high school football game was 80 to 78, 158 points scored in a single game. Now granted this game did go into overtime, but 158 points in one game is preposterous. But with this performance out.

So this fellow right here, his name is David Booth and David here founded a hedge fund that just so happens to manage about a trillion dollars. And David's been thinking a lot recently, you know what, I love Kansas so much, I'm gonna give them $300 million, the single largest donation in college sports history. In fact, he's such a big donor for Kansas, they renamed their stadium after the guy. They call it the booth. And for anyone who's saying that this is just for new locker rooms or new stadiums, it's full of shit. Yes, Kansas said they're gonna use 75 million of that 300 to finish the stadium, but the other 225 million, where do you think that's going? This is an NFL war chest that they're gonna be using for new talent. And the recruiting and transfer portal is gonna look like this next year because now Kansas has a fuck ton of money and nowhere to spend it. And it's once again proving that college football is a pay to win game. Now, if you wanna win the Big 12 as much as David does here, Baylor better put 300.

And Jack decided to find the two smallest commanders fans who were just standing there doing nothing, and knocked this guy out. But he gives this guy a right hook for no reason and started randomly assaulting this other guy, in which, after the fact, he starts flexing and says that I don't fucking lose. And that viral video was even liked by Lamar Jackson. But NFL fans really didn't like this move, so they decided to ruin this guy's life. They first found his Facebook page, where it listed his job.

Not only that, every position looks really good in this helmet. It has excellent Protection, it is super comfortable, and it looks super drippy bro. What more can you ask for? Beginning at number two we have the ride O speed. This helmet may not be as good as the speed flex, but it will get the job done. Honestly bro, what makes the speed super nice is that it feels lighter than the speed flex. Honestly bro, this is one of those helmets that you can literally make one of the drippiest looking helmets on the football field. Last but not least, we have the Ryde L Exo nom.

Everybody sees this as an indictment on the player. Like, hey, I wasn't good enough to play at Georgia, but maybe that system just wasn't for you. Like, just look at Joe Burrow. He went to Ohio State, his hometown team. They didn't want him. When he was transferring, he tried to go to Bama. Bama said, you can be a backup here. But guess what? He found the right fit at L S U, and guess what happened. Heisman, Perfect Season, national champ, and No. 1 overall pick. It's all about the fit. Two, if you and your position coach don't get along, it's time to go, because odds are he's already looking to replace you. This could also mean that he gives other players opportunities he wouldn't normally give them instead of giving them to you, even if you're the better player. And also common for guys to say, oh, my coach is tripping, that's why I didn't play. Everybody kind of looks at them a little bit crazy. But no, sometimes the coach genuinely is tripping or just downright lying to people. You wouldn't believe how much, oh, yeah, you're starting this week. you're gonna play a lot this week.

Like, you're really telling me Patrick Mahomes is 28 years old and Joe Burrow is 27? I'm not even gonna lie, I knew Patrick was 28. I really thought burrow was 25, 26 at the max. I mean, even if you look when they got drafted, Mahomes was drafted in 2017, Joe Burrow was drafted in 2020. And I know there's some crazy age gaps in the NFL, but I just found out this one this morning and I am in shock. I mean, these two guys are really one year apart. And look at the type of careers they've had. Mahomes has played 96 games, Joe Burrow has played 52. So Mahomes is almost doubling him. And obviously he's played more games, so these stats don't even compare. Mahomes blows him out and almost everything outside of completion percentage and interceptions. And let's cover up those awards because that's embarrassing for Joe Burrow. Either way, I'm just in shock. I truly didn't know this at all. And I've always said that Joe Burrow is gonna be the damn Marino of this era. A great quarterback, has great stats, but he never gets a ring. And obviously he still has a long career left that can change. But man, this is wild.

NFC is where godly rosters get Qbs overpaid. And he's exactly right. If you're a rookie quarterback, you don't wanna play in the AFC right now, like it or not. Anyway you slice it, the four best quarterbacks all play in the AFC, Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen and Joe Burrow. To make the Super Bowl, you have to be two of these guys. But in the NFC, that's not the case. There's very few Qbs, if any, you can point to in this conference that are true game elevators. The reason some of these teams are successful is because they're extremely well rounded rosters that have LED to their quarterbacks getting overpaid and their flaws getting exposed come playoff time. We know what happened with Dak Prescott. We know what happened with Daniel Jones. We know what I think is gonna happen with Sam Donald. We know it's gonna happen with Brock Purdy. This is just what it looks like. Now, the problem with those Qbs in the NFC right now is they can't out Superman. Whoever comes out of the AFC, when the chips are down, the system fails around them, they're not gonna be able to beat the Lamar Jackson's, the Patrick Mahomes, the Josh Allen's, the Joe Burrows of the world. And that's why whoever comes out of the AFC this.

And the answer is he had him from Day 1 and his name was Tyreek Hill. Matthew Stafford walked into Detroit and his best wide receiver from Day 1 was Calvin Johnson. Sure, the Lions weren't world beaters, but they immediately locked down their QB receiver duo for the future. Philip Rivers was drafted to the Chargers in 2004 and from day one his best receiving target was Antonio Gates. Not to mention prime Malcolm Thomas in the backfield. Holmes hasn't gotten an ounce of sympathy from NFL fans in the media because he inherited the greatest offensive cheat code of the late 20 in Tyreek Hill and arguably the greatest pass catching tight end in Travis Kelce. But every QB goes through a phase where they have a lot of weapons and then they don't. I think Tom Brady is a great example of this. And Mahomes actually did this in his last two Super Bowl wins. Tom didn't start with the great offense then got Randy Moss, but was still able to win at the highest level after Randy's departure with guys like Julian Edelman, Danny Amendola, and Jake Hogan. Of course Rob Gronkowski. Does Lamar have the better offensive support?

I think at quarterback, Patrick Mahomes retired today. He's a hall of Famer. I think Aaron Rodgers, I always like better than Farve, is a slam dunk hall of Famer. Travis Kelsey could retire today. He's in. So is his brother Jason. At center, Trent Williams, maybe the best left tackle ever. He is on a short list. Aaron Donald, again, second best interior d lineman I've ever seen to Reggie White and it's close. Miles Garrett and Von Miller on the edge. They just play different and look different. Bobby Wagner has been a nine time all Pro. He's a hall of Famer. And Justin Tucker, the six or seven players to me that look like it's the waiting room. Joe Burrow is just different. He can go toe to toe with Mahomes and he doesn't feel inferior. Justin Jefferson is, is. Randy Moss to me like one of those level players. I think Nick Bosa, the edge for the Niners, Micah Parsons.

Jack only took a sip, not realizing it would turn him into her. He cut his jeans into shorts, revealing a seductive waist. Then he set a timer because the effect would only last for half an hour. Jack did this to take advantage of his wife's beauty. The wealthy man was very pleased with his appearance, quickly gave Jack a sports car. Jack eagerly accepted the deal, but then he noticed the timer had only five minutes left. He rushed out. When Jack returned home, the timer ended exactly and he returned to his original form. His wife wanted to ask him about the car, but Jack clearly had no intention of revealing anything. She noticed the thick hair on his legs, instantly understanding how he got the car. The next day, his wife asked Jack to take care of the kids, but he refused. She felt utterly powerless at that moment. The wealthy man called again to arrange a meeting, overwhelmed with excitement, asked his wife for more breast milk. She refused flatly, but Jack ignored her objections, set another timer and left for the meeting. When the magnate unexpectedly proposed to him, Jack accepted without hesitation. Back home, he immediately asked his wife for milk. An hour later, his wife handed him a bottle, but it only contained 10 milliliters. It was barely enough. The man demanded 100 bottles and pushed his wife into the Room. What he didn't know was she had used pig milk instead. He still didn't realize his face had transformed into that of a pig.

The little cake was washed away by the rain, while the slice of bread was riddled with holes from the falling drops. The food panicked and scattered. Every moment, another piece lost its life. For Miss Bread, the rain was deadly. One drop was enough to dissolve her completely. In that critical moment, a protective box shielded her from the storm, and they saved her. The food fled in terror towards shelter. In the chaos, a wine bottle shattered and peanuts were trampled. Just as they neared safety, a torrent surged in, sweeping all the food into the water. Luckily, the Sausage Brothers and Miss Bread hid inside a waterproof box, narrowly escaping disaster, and also hopped frantically trying to escape. Seeing the devastation outside, Miss Bread grew terrified. Little sausage Jack was brave, leaping onto a bag to save the mango and coconut, and carried them safely to shore. Meanwhile, Miss Bread was in the box, about to be swept into the sewer. Just when they thought all was lost, the chewing gum remembered. Great power comes with great responsibility. It pressed a button and slid into the drain, its elasticity blocking the entire pipe. The food seized the chance to climb over it, and with all their strength, they escaped the danger. After the rescue, the sausage tried to pull the gum back, but could only retrieve a small piece. The gum's sacrifice left him heartbroken. But it said, this is the most meaningful death I've had. And with those final words, it disappeared.

I'm not some pro photographer, but my friends and family always hit me up to shoot their stuff for free. Usually I don't mind because I actually love taking portraits. But sometimes people are such complete jerks that it makes me wanna throw my camera at their face. A few years back, this coworker, Ashley, asked me to do a family shoot on Mother's Day. I figured I had time before seeing my own mom and she said she'd cover brunch at this winery, so why not? We carpooled out there and I'm thinking it's gonna be Ashley, her husband Rick and their two kids, easy money. We get there and I see like 30 people standing around. Turns out it's Rick's entire extended family, his parents, both grandmas, aunts, uncles, siblings, cousins, literally everyone, 27 people total. I'm immediately freaking out because I told my mom I'd be there by 3 and it's already noon. I pull Ashley aside and tell her I gotta leave in three hours max. He's like, oh, Rick will keep everyone moving. Don't worry. Famous last words. Brunch drags on forever. These people are drinking mimosas and telling stories like we got all day. I'm checking my phone every five minutes. Finally, at like 1:30, we start photos and I have maybe an hour and a half to work with. I asked Rick to help keep his family organized and he's like, absolutely, let's do this. So I Plan out the shots, group smaller families, couples, kids, standard stuff. Should take an hour tops if everyone cooperates. That's when Rick completely lost his mind. This dude starts screaming at people like a drill sergeant. I'm talking full on yelling at his 70 year old mom to move your ass faster and telling his 5 year old.

When my daughter was 16, she got rear ended by a drunk driver while stopped at a red light. The guy was clearly wasted, failed three sobriety tests. But somehow his expensive lawyer was trying to blame my daughter for the accident. The crash left her with a concussion and whiplash. She he missed two weeks of school and had to quit her job at the local coffee shop because she couldn't handle the physical demands anymore. But this lawyer was determined to prove she was somehow at fault. During the deposition, he kept asking the same questions over and over, trying to confuse her or get her to contradict herself. My daughter has always been sharp, but head injuries can affect your memory. So I was worried about how she'd handle his aggressive tactics. Lawyer starts with this condescending tone. Now, Miss Johnson, you claim you were completely stopped at the intersection, correct? Yes, sir. The light was red. But how can you be absolutely certain you were stopped? Isn't it possible you were still slowing down? Because my car has something called brakes and I use them. The stenographer smiled, but the lawyer wasn't amused. He kept pushing. You were on your phone at the time of the accident, weren't you? No, I wasn't. Come now, you're a teenager. All teenagers are on their phones constantly. Surely you were texting someone. I wasn't on my phone. I find That very hard to believe. What teenager isn't on their phone while driving? That's when my daughter looked him dead in the eye and said, the kind whose parents actually taught her how to drive responsibly. Maybe if more adults acted like adults instead of getting drunk and driving into teenagers, we wouldn't need to have these conversations. The room went completely silent. The lawyer's face turned red, but he kept going. Let's talk about your alleged injuries. Concussions are very.

My teacher made us all have a signed seating and I got stuck in the back next to the quiet kid. He always weirded me out. Never talked to anyone. Just drew these weird, dark sketches in his notebook during lectures. But that Tuesday morning started normal. I was trying to stay awake when a piece of paper slid onto my desk from his direction. Note was folded into a tight square and when I opened it, his handwriting was surprisingly neat. Enjoy your last few minutes alive. My first thought was that this was some weird prank. Maybe he was finally trying to make friends in the most awkward way possible. So I turned back to give him a confused look, but his face was serious. Another note hit my desk, just one word, look. I glanced back and saw his backpack partially open, something dark and metallic visible inside. It was a handgun. My hand started shaking so bad I dropped my pencil. Our teacher was writing formulas and had no idea what was going on. 28 other students in the room. My mind raced through the options. I could run out the door right now, save myself, but everyone else would be at risk. I could yell at everyone to run, but his hand was already halfway in his bag and I'd probably be first. I could pull the fire alarm, but it was across the Room. My stomach churned and I genuinely thought I might throw up right there on my desk. Then it hit me, the bathroom pass. I could ask to go to the bathroom, walk past it to the office, warn them quietly. They could call the police, lock down the school, do it properly. My throat felt like sandpaper when I raised my hand, Mr Peterson, can I use the bathroom? He barely looked up, just nodded and pointed to the pass by the door. I stood up, my legs feeling like jelly, trying to look normal, casual, like I wasn't about to potentially let 29 people die or get myself killed trying to save them. I grabbed the wooden bathroom pass, my hands sweating so much it almost slipped. As I reached the door, I heard another voice. Hey, can I go, too? I turned around and it was him. My heart stopped. Just wait until he gets back. But he was already standing up. It's an emergency. Sadly, something in his voice made our teacher wave.

Her mother in law smirked. Only close family gets a table. No place card for me. Sis giggled. Guess you don't count. I took my gift, said, then I'm leaving. Sis went pale. Wait. I knew walking into my sister Emily's wedding, I'd be background noise. She was always the golden child, the princess who got what she wanted, even when it came at my expense. I was used to it, but I wasn't prepared for how far they'd go to make sure I knew I didn't belong. The first slap came when I realized I wasn't in the wedding party. Not unusual, I told myself. Some siblings aren't. Then I Learned Emily's coworker, childhood neighbor, even her fiance's cousin's girlfriend were bridesmaids. That stung. The second slap was the seating chart. I went to grab my card, except it wasn't there. Not with my parents, not with my cousins, not anywhere. The wedding planner scanned her clipboard, then gave me that tight, pitying smile people wear when they know something's wrong. Oh, Alex, right here. She pointed. My heart sank. My seat wasn't in the grand ballroom with the chandeliers and champagne. It was outside, a lonely two top shoved near the coat rack where guests would dump jackets and ignore me all night. At first, I laughed. It had to be a mistake. But no, that was my assigned spot. Like I was luggage, I stormed into the Bridal suite. Emily was glowing, all teeth and diamonds. Our mother hovering like she was hand Maiden to a queen. Why is my seat in the hallway? I asked, holding up the card. Emily giggled. Actually giggled. Oh, that we had to prioritize. Close family. I stared. I am close family. Mom swooped in, sugary and sharp. Alex, don't make a scene. This is Emily's special day. I wasn't making a scene. I was trying to understand why my own family had literally shoved me out the door. Then Emily delivered the kill shot. You kind of aren't really immediate family anymore. The words landed like ice water. You moved out, you don't visit much. You're not married. It's just different now. Not immediate family. Because I dared to grow up? Because I wasn't still orbiting her. Before I could answer, another voice cut in. Emily's new mother in law. A woman I barely knew but instantly recognized, the kind who thrives on drama. She eyed me up and down with a smirk. Oh, so you're Alex. I was wondering who that little seat belonged to. My smile was tight enough to crack my teeth. Yep, that's me. The sibling who apparently doesn't count. She chuckled, full of fake sympathy. Well, you know how weddings are. Only the most important people get the best spots. And that's when it clicked. This wasn't a mistake. It was deliberate. And Emily was letting her laugh about it. Something inside me snapped. I Plastered on my sweetest smile and leaned toward the mother in law. Honey, you know what Emily said about you the other night? Emily froze her. M I L. Tilted her head. Oh, yeah. She was terrified you'd ruin her wedding photos with, uh. What was it? Emily? Oh, right. Your tacky dress. The room went silent. M I L's face hardened, Emily smile cracked. I kept going. Casual as poison. And she was so stressed about speeches. Said if you gave

This is Michelle Hempstead. Michelle had two dogs, a Rottweiler and a Pomeranian. Apparently, these two were great friends. In fact, the Pomeranian usually kind of took control, was kind of in charge of the Rottweiler. Even on July 29th of 2024, Michelle was feeding the two out of a 20 piece McDonald's chicken nugget. Usually, this was no problem. Sometimes she allegedly would even put a nugget or some food in her mouth and feed it straight to her Rottweiler. In particular, the palm and the Rottweiler had their own little thing. The Rottweiler, named Trig, would kind of do this chomp thing when he was telling palm, the Pomeranian, that he was gonna get the chicken nugget that she would throw up in the air for them. If palm wanted to get it, then palm would make a little snip and noise that would let Trig know that he wanted it. This time, however, both of them jumped for it. Neither one of them took the cue of the other. They got into a little fight. Michelle wanted to stop the fight, so she got in the middle of it. And while doing that, Trig clamped down on her arm. He unfortunately severed an artery. Now, Michelle got out of the situation, crawled over her balcony and towards the park for help. But unfortunately, she lost too much blood too fast, and she lost her life. What's Even sadder is just four weeks before this, in June, Michelle had just lost her daughter. Now, since Michelle was the sole owner of these two dogs, and she is now passed, the dogs were seized and disclaimed for destruction, meaning that now that they didn't have an aunt and owner, or they weren't claimed, they could now be put to sleep.

And we now have the results of the polygraph test that were given because of their disappearance. According to the court documents, their mother, Malaya passed the polygraph test as well as their stepfather Daniel. Their step grandmother Jamie also took a polygraph test. However, they said she wasn't suitable for it and they could not render an answer. Since their disappearance, there has been an extensive search for these children. And really the only material things that have been found is Lily's blanket that was about a kilometer from the family home on a tree. And they also found a piece of her blanket at the end of the driveway in a trash bag. There was also a potential footprint that police found. However, nothing came from it. If you haven't heard of this case, here is a quick timeline. Monday, April 28th and Tuesday, April 29th, both Lily and Jack went to school. Wednesday was a stay at home day. They didn't have school. And then Thursday, May 1st, around 6:00am, their mother messaged the school and said that Lily and Jack would not be going. She claimed that Lily had a cough. 2:25 That same day was the last verifiable sighting of Lily and Jack. They were seen on surveillance camera at a dollarama at night. The kids were put to bed in The same clothes they had on that day. And Jack had a diaper because he wasn't fully potty trained. The following day, May 2nd, Malaya, their mother, contacted the school again and said they would be staying home. At some point, Lily and Jack wake up and then Daniel and Malaya were in their bedroom. She said they were in and out of sleep. She was feeding the baby because they also have a child together. Lily pops into the room and they're hearing the children and then all of a sudden it's silent. At 10:01, Malaya calls the police and says she believes her children wandered away from the home. She said both children are possibly autistic. Apparently, they noticed that the kids boots were gone and Daniel decides to get in his vehicle, drive around and try to find the kids. And this is all what's being claimed by the parents. He said he went all around looking for them and that he didn't take his phone and he didn't even check the phone for the time. He was just searching for the kids.

I was working at GameStop during the PS five launch when this teenager walks in with his mom. Kid marches straight to the counter and demands, I want that PS five right now. I explain we're sold out. There's a waiting list. His mom immediately jumps in. Sweetie, maybe we can call other stores. This brat starts yelling, this is stupid. We have money. He kicks the display case, knocks over our Pokemon card rack. Other customers are staring. His mom just keeps apologizing, offering to pay for damages. I tell him to calm down or leave. He laughs and pulls out a wad of cash, waves it in my face. See this? This is more than you make in a week. His mom tries to put the money away, but he jerks back. Mom, stop. This loser needs to see what real money looks like. That's when he spots this quiet kid, maybe 12, carefully counting crumpled bills at the used game section. The entitled teen walks over and starts taunting him. Look at the this broke loser counting pennies, he announces loudly. Probably can't even afford a game. The quiet kid looks up embarrassed, tries to move away, but the team follows him, still waving his cash. What are you buying, poor boy? A five dollar game from 2015. I step over. Leave him alone. The team, he spins around fanning out hundred dollar bills. Oh, look, the minimum Wage hero wants to save his boyfriend. His mom finally speaks up. Honey, maybe we should just go to Best Buy. No, he shouts. I want the PS five from here. This idiot probably has one hidden in the back for himself. He pushes past me toward the employee area. I block him. He shoves me hard, nearly knocking me into the game wall. Don't touch me, peasant. My dad will buy this whole store just to fire you. The other customers are backing away. Now the entitled teen notices everyone staring and gets even louder. What? He's probably stealing systems. I bet he makes minimum wage and lives with his mom. He turns back to the quiet kid who's now sitting on the floor collecting his scattered money. The team drops the 20 dollar Bill next to him mockingly. Here's charity, bro boy, maybe now you can afford something decent. He kicks the rest of the money sending bills flying across the store. Pick it up, poor kid. Maybe you can afford a candy bar instead. The quiet kid starts crying, crawling around collect taking his money. The teen's mom finally tries to intervene. Sweetie, that's enough. Let's just leave. But her son pushes her hand away. I'm not done. This store owes me a PS five. He marches back to me, gets in my face. I know you have systems in the back. I stay calm. Sir, we don't have any PS Fives. I've told you three times. You're Lying. He slams his fist on the counter. Check the back room again. I'm not going anywhere. You need to leave. He pulls out his phone, dials a number. Dad, yeah, I need you to come here. This GameStop employee is refusing to sell me a PS five. I can hear yelling through the phone. No, dad, dad, I didn't break anything. Well, maybe a little, but he started it. More yelling. The teen hangs up, furious. My dad's coming here. You're so fired. He looks around wildly, spots the quiet kids still organizing his money and gets a nasty idea. Hey, bro, boy, stand up. The kid looks terrified but doesn't move. The teen walks over and towers over him. I said, stand up. You're going to tell everyone how this loser employee was mean to me? The quiet kid shakes his head. The teen grabs his shoulder, yanks him to his feet. Say it. Say he was rude to customers. Leave him alone, I warned. Moving closer or what you'll call security. This is a mall GameStop moron. There is no security. The team pushes the quiet kid toward the counter. Tell him you saw the employee being unprofessional, the kid whispers. I don't wanna lie. Then you're as pathetic as he is. The team shoves him hard into a game display. The quiet kid hits the metal shelf, games scattering everywhere. That's my breaking point. I walked over, picked up every Bill and counted it out loud.

Well, what do you think, Floyd? How did Lois Griffin do what no other challenger could do and knock out Deirdre Jackson? I, I have a strong headache when I go to sleep and wake up. And how do you think that's gonna affect Jackson's next fight? My Puerto Rican wife got fat. Oh, sure. Women's boxing is a rapidly growing part of the field. You should consider your wife competing for a belt. Well, she did look like she knew what she was doing up there. Think about it. Here's my card, huh? What can I say? I really Like watching her box. That means two things.
