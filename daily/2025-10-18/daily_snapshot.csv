The 13 year old boy used a slingshot to save his sister from the kidnappers, but he was sued by the kidnappers and taken to court demanding compensation of eight thousand thousand dollars from the boy's mother. On May 10th, 13 year old Owen Burns from Michigan heard his sister's plea for help while playing video games at home. He then saw a 17 year old Terrence Coleman kidnap his 8 year old sister and drag her into the woods. He quickly grabbed the slingshot, loaded it with marbles and both of his shots hit the kidnappers. Due to pain, the kidnapper released his sister and fled the scene. It is reported that Terrence first suffered a chest injury and the severe pain made him mistakenly believe that he had been shot. Owen fired another shot, this time hitting Terence's eye and successfully saving his sister. Afterwards, Terence's family filed a lawsuit against Owen's mother because the doctor informed Terence that his right eye will be permanently blind. Terrence's family insists that he was just playing with the girl, not kidnapping. They claim that Owen caused Terrence to go blind for no reason and demand compensation of eight thousand thousand dollars. This case is still under investigation. If he wasn't kidnapping, why did he take someone else's child into the woods and run away?

So he gets a taxi as quickly as possible to a nearby repair shop where they charge him twelve hundred dollars to fix his guitar. he called the airline the next day to ask them to pay for the repairs, but they refuse telling him that it's too too late now because he should have filed a complaint the day it happened, which he tried to do. So that's when he decided it was time to get revenge. He got a few of his friends together to write a song dissing United Airlines, thinking it would just be a funny joke.

The 13 year old boy used a slingshot to save his sister from the kidnappers, but he was sued by the kidnappers and taken to court demanding compensation of eight thousand thousand dollars from the boy's mother. On May 10th, 13 year old Owen Burns from Michigan heard his sister's plea for help while playing video games at home. He then saw a 17 year old Terrence Coleman kidnap his 8 year old sister and drag her into the woods. He quickly grabbed the slingshot, loaded it with marbles and both of his shots hit the kidnappers. Due to pain, the kidnapper released his sister and fled the scene. It is reported that Terrence first suffered a chest injury and the severe pain made him mistakenly believe that he had been shot. Owen fired another shot, this time hitting Terence's eye and successfully saving his sister. Afterwards, Terence's family filed a lawsuit against Owen's mother because the doctor informed Terence that his right eye will be permanently blind. Terrence's family insists that he was just playing with the girl, not kidnapping. They claim that Owen caused Terrence to go blind for no reason and demand compensation of eight thousand thousand dollars. This case is still under investigation. If he wasn't kidnapping, why did he take someone else's child into the woods and run away?

Got chalked at 8:30. I came back at 12:30. The truck marks are still on it. So I wrote it for a two hour violation. But Brennan is violating the Constitution Michigan who argued that marking tires is similar to police secretly putting a GPS on a vehicle without a proper warrant. That's a violation of the 4th Amendment right against unreasonable searches. I don't mind at all. I think it's a chalk wipes off very, very easily. So it's not a problem. The court, which covers four Midwest states, ruled that now a warrant is needed because the purpose of marking tires is to raise revenue and not for public safety. Ken Kissell, who owns Livewire Security in Irvington, says the chalking keeps three spots open for customers. So somebody can run in, run out and not have to worry about getting a ticket for just being parked for 5 minutes like you do with a lot of other towns that have parking meters. In the meantime, the village is considering more high tech options.

Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave, otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off, but the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

A man picked up his wife and threw her towards the TV like a rag doll while she desperately begged, please don't do this. All of this happened in front of their five month old child who witnessed the entire scene but was powerless to intervene, leaving an indelible traumatic memory. The man is 31 year old Zach Stacy, a former New York Jets running back. Later he was only sentenced to one month in prison after admitting to the crime of criminal injury. The newly exposed video shows the severity of the incident where they had a heated argument over a rent payment issue. His wife Kristen Evans attempted to escape, but he chased after her and used a trash can to smash the car, even grabbing the car's wiper. According to a home surveillance video, Zack first hit Evans twice on the back of the head with an unidentified object and picked him up and threw him heavily towards the TV. Please, please, please. Evans can be heard constantly pleading with him to stop. Even in front of their 5 month old child, Zack continues to commit violence. Afterwards, Evans said in an interview that she didn't want Zach to stay in prison for even a day. No one wants to send their son's father to prison. Zach was charged with serious assault and criminal damage and sentenced to one month in prison. At present, this mother and son are receiving psychological and legal support. Do you think he should not go to jail?

He was quickly arrested. The judge sentenced him to 13 years in prison. But when it was time to be imprisoned, no police came to take him away. He didn't try to escape because he knew he deserved it. He just waited nervously in his own home, expecting the police to appear at any moment. Several weeks have passed and the police have not come yet. He thought that the police might have revoked his criminal record. So in the following years, he continued his life and completely forgot about it. He got married, started a construction company and even took the initiative to help young people, avoiding them from repeating his mistakes. But 13 years later, the police suddenly came to his house and arrested him, which shocked him greatly. Originally, due to a technical issue, the police thought he was in prison for the past 13 years. When they were about to release him, they realized he wasn't there at all. So they immediately sent police to arrest him. When the police told him that he must now complete his 13 year prison sentence, he collapsed in court. The judge saw that Michael had completely changed his life and successfully reformed himself. So he released him and did not let him serve another sentence in prison.

A customer was dissatisfied with the temperature of the spicy soup and poured boiling soup onto the cashier causing serious injuries to the cashier. At present, the victim has filed a lawsuit seeking compensation of $3 million. Thirty one year old Amanda Nicole Martinez previously ordered a take out menu soup to bring home. Subsequently, she angrily returned to the store claiming that the temperature of the soup was too high and that the plastic from the takeaway box had melted and fallen into the soup. Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave. Otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off. But the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

He was quickly arrested. The judge sentenced him to 13 years in prison. But when it was time to be imprisoned, no police came to take him away. He didn't try to escape because he knew he deserved it. He just waited nervously in his own home, expecting the police to appear at any moment. Several weeks have passed and the police have not come yet. He thought that the police might have revoked his criminal record. So in the following years, he continued his life and completely forgot about it. He got married, started a construction company and even took the initiative to help young people, avoiding them from repeating his mistakes. But 13 years later, the police suddenly came to his house and arrested him, which shocked him greatly. Originally, due to a technical issue, the police thought he was in prison for the past 13 years. When they were about to release him, they realized he wasn't there at all. So they immediately sent police to arrest him. When the police told him that he must now complete his 13 year prison sentence, he collapsed in court. The judge saw that Michael had completely changed his life and successfully reformed himself. So he released him and did not let him serve another sentence in prison.

NASA County Police say a 61 year old man was magnetically pulled into an MRI Wednesday while wearing a large metal chain. He apparently walked into an unauthorized area at NASA Open MRI in Westbury while a scan was underway and he was drawn into the machine. He's now in critical condition. That really make me upset because that should never happen. Police say the victim is from Long Island and was not a patient. Rather he was at the facility with someone else. NASA Open MRI, which has several other locations, offers both open and closed scans at nearby North Shore University Hospital. Medical professionals say they're shocked and that rigorous safety protocol should be in place to avoid attracting metal objects. If this was a chain that was wrapped around the neck, I could imagine any kind of strangulation injuries that could happen, asphyxiation, cervical spine injuries. If the patient was slammed against the m R, I, you know, any kind of blunt force trauma that we can think about could happen.

On their channel, they have almost 2 million subscribers where they film some of the most top tier celebrities shopping at their store from influencers to streamers to rappers, just about any celebrity you can think of have shopped there and doing this. Cool kicks turned the resale game into entertainment. And this made the shop a tourist destination in Los Angeles and one of the most recognized names in sneaker culture. But just as recent as yesterday thing, things turned for the worse. And this actually happened live on a stream which was abruptly stopped because of loud noises outside of the store. And then videos and photos started to appear on social media from concern and fans of police at the warehouse where they had multiple people in handcuffs and stacks of sneaker boxes being loaded into a truck. And the owner of the store was arrested around four, 45 PM and booked on felony charges later that evening. And this was under the LAPD's Bunko and Forgery Division. And while there's not a lot of information about this right now, cause it literally just happened yesterday, but the Bunko and Forgery Division handles fraud, counterfeit goods and financial crime.

Shaquille O'neal wasn't just a Tesla customer, he was a superfan, a full on believer in Elon Musk's bold electric dream. He didn't buy one or two, he bought three cyber trucks hoping to be part of the revolution. But this week, Shaq confirmed he's out. He sold every single one of them. And while Shaq's name makes headlines, the real story is the truck itself. Once marketed as a symbol of innovation, the cyber truck has quickly become a rolling punch line. Within just 12 months, its value has dropped by over 35%, outpacing every pickup in America five times faster than a Ford F1 50. Shacks summed it up better than anyone. Owning a cyber truck doesn't make you look powerful. It makes you look like a test subject in a failed experiment. Tesla said this was the future, but it's shedding owners, losing trust and sinking in value faster than anyone expected.

Let me explain. So for those of you who don't know, Cool Kicks isn't just a regular sneaker shop, it's a pop culture hotspot. On their channel, they have almost 2 million subscribers where they film some of the most top tier celebrities shopping at their store from influencers to streamers to rappers, just about any celebrity you can think of have shopped there and doing this. Cool kicks turned the resale game into entertainment. And this made the shop a tourist destination in Los Angeles and one of the most recognized names in sneaker culture. But just as recent as yesterday thing, things turned for the worse. And this actually happened live on a stream which was abruptly stopped because of loud noises outside of the store. And then videos and photos started to appear on social media from concern and fans of police at the warehouse where they had multiple people in handcuffs and stacks of sneaker boxes being loaded into a truck. And the owner of the store was arrested around four, 45 PM and booked on felony charges later that evening. And this was under the LAPD's Bunko and Forgery Division. And while there's not a lot of information about this right now, cause it literally just happened yesterday, but the Bunko and Forgery Division handles fraud, counterfeit goods and financial crime.

Nassau County police say a 61 year old man was magnetically pulled into an MRI Wednesday while wearing a large metal chain. He apparently walked into an unauthorized area at NASA Open MRI in Westbury while a scan was underway, and he was drawn into the machine. He's now in critical condition. That really make me upset because that should never happen. Police say the victim is from Long Island and was not a patient. Rather, he was at the facility with someone else. NASA Open MRI, which has several other locations, offers both open and closed scans at nearby North Shore University Hospital. Medical professionals say they're shocked and that rigorous safety protocol should be in place to avoid attracting metal objects. If this was a chain that was wrapped around the neck, I could imagine any kind of strangulation injuries that could happen. Asphyxiation, cervical spine injuries. If the patient was slammed against the M R I, you know, you. Any kind of blunt force trauma that we can think about could happen.

Shaquille O'neal wasn't just a Tesla customer, he was a superfan, a full on believer in Elon Musk's bold electric dream. He didn't buy one or two, he bought three cyber trucks hoping to be part of the revolution. But this week, Shaq confirmed he's out. He sold every single one of them. And while Shaq's name makes headlines, the real story is the truck itself. Once marketed as a symbol of innovation, the cyber truck has quickly become a rolling punch line. Within just 12 months, its value has dropped by over 35%, outpacing every pickup in America five times faster than a Ford F1 50. Shacks summed it up better than anyone. Owning a cyber truck doesn't make you look powerful. It makes you look like a test subject in a failed experiment. Tesla said this was the future, but it's shedding owners, losing trust and sinking in value faster than anyone expected.

A customer was dissatisfied with the temperature of the spicy soup and poured boiling soup onto the cashier causing serious injuries to the cashier. At present, the victim has filed a lawsuit seeking compensation of $3 million. Thirty one year old Amanda Nicole Martinez previously ordered a take out menu soup to bring home. Subsequently, she angrily returned to the store claiming that the temperature of the soup was too high and that the plastic from the takeaway box had melted and fallen into the soup. Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave. Otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off. But the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

So back in 2015, Hard Rock Stadium underwent a 500 million dollar renovation so they could host events like the Super Bowl. However, they designed it in a way for the Miami Dolphins to win more football games. The worst problem with the old stadium was how hot it would get. The Dolphins have by far the warmest stadium in football. The average home game is about 75 degrees and early in the season it could be over 100. The old stadium had no shade. So to solve that, they added an open air canopy to make it cooler. But what many people don't know is that it's not shady for everyone. The stadium was made so that the opposing team sideline would be directly in the sun during day games and the Dolphins are perfectly in the shade. This makes a massive difference. Last season, the Vikings sideline when they came to Miami was 30 degrees hotter than the Dolphins. There's was 120 degrees compared to the Dolphins 90. On top of all that, the Dolphins, unlike most teams, force the opposing team to wear darker uniforms while they wear white. They do that to make them sweat in the sun even more.

Yeah, let's be honest, man. That's up to you. How do you want the car to feel when you boost it? Well, obviously I want the car to be faster. Yeah, but do you want it to be smooth, fast, or do you not mind waiting a second or two and then taking off? Hold up. I'm confused. What are you talking about? Turbo chargers work off the exhaust gas, meaning you had to build up enough exhaust gas to spin the turbine. That's what we call boost lag. Oh, okay. Is there any way to get rid of boost lag? Well, you could run anti lag, which would be more expensive and of course you run the risk of blowing up your motor. But if you don't have anti lag, you could also break boost. What's that? When you step on the brakes and the gas at the same time to build up pressure. So when you let off the brakes, you'll already be in boost, but of course that'll put a lot of stress on your brakes. Okay, I see what you're saying. What about the other one you mentioned? Well, your car is na right now. Tossing a supercharger on would be the best way to gain power while still retaining good throttle response. There's no lag really at all. Ah, superchargers are belt driven. Low RPMs equals low boost. Higher RPMs equals high boost, not To mention it makes your car sound like an airplane. There's also twin charging, but I know you can't afford that. Twin charging, what's that? That's when you got a turbo and a supercharger. Wow.

Uh, why are you asking? Well, I was watching fast and furious, and every single time someone's about to lose, they hit this red button that says NOS, and then next thing you know, the car is going way faster than it ever did. What exactly are they doing, and how do I do it to my car? Well, first of all, you absolutely don't need it on your car, but I'll tell you how it works. Okay, fair enough. So, NOS stands for Nitrous Oxide System. You remember those blue bottles they would show hidden in the trunk or under the seats? Yeah. Looked pretty cool. Well, those are NOS bottles, and inside those bottles, it's nitrous oxide, but in its liquid form. Often times, people think NOS is a different type of gasoline that makes your car go faster. Wait, it's not? No, but it does work in unison with your gasoline. Wait, dad, I'm kind of confused. Well, remember the basic principles of an engine? Air, fuel, spark, and compression. Yeah, I got that. Well, some people have their system set up so when they hit that button, it shoots nitrous into the cylinders or into the intake manifold. And again, it's liquid when it's in the bottle, but when it goes into the engine, it's no longer liquid. So it's air. Yeah, exactly. It's boost, but without turbo chargers or superchargers. Of course, you can still run nitrous on

Where'd you find the roll cage at? Oh, I got that for 200 on Facebook Marketplace and then I just spray painted it at home. Looks pretty nice, huh? Yeah, looks legit. That's a nice color. Is it paint or wrap? Oh, that's paint. I found this ad on Facebook Marketplace and they said you're doing paint jobs for $600. I was a little skeptical, but it came out pretty nice. I know you have favorites. What about that body key?

Nah, I can't right now. Your mom says I have too many. We'd have to sell one. Easy. Sell your civic. The hell. Why don't I just sell you then, dad? What's the big deal? It's a freaking Honda Civic. You got all these super cars, yet you keep that civic in the showroom. Why? Cause I can. Cause it's funny. Cause I want to you realize without that civic, we wouldn't have any of this today. I'd sell any of these cars in a heartbeat before selling that civic. Call me crazy, but I'm nostalgic that way. It's not even a type R. It's just a Si. Yeah, it's one of the most famous Civic Si's to exist. When I was 18, I had people from Australia telling me it was their favorite car. It's a symbol of worldwide respect and unification, bro. Why you think I got modism plastered on the windshield? Alright, jeez, I get it. Sorry I asked. Nah, homie, you gotta learn respect and appreciation. Since you want another car, why don't you sell your car? No, it's my first car. I'm keeping that thing forever. Yeah, same thing with my civic. It was my first car. I'm not selling it. Just the Si. Get a load of this guy. It's a Si with the Type R motor pushing 5 hundo, bro. Oh, for real? Can I drive it? Heck no, man. After all the BS you said Here, I. I'm sorry, dad. I didn't think about it like that. Everything.

You ever seen that video of those three GT3 RS lined up, then they all start going and then take off? Oh yeah, the video is pretty sick. Well, that sound you heard is launch control, but what's it do? Well, as the name suggests, it controls your launch so you get the best launch possible. Wait, but don't you just floor it to take off? If you over Rev it, your tires can spin out leading to a bad launch. If you under Rev it, you're not gonna have enough power to launch the car, also leading to a bad launch. There's a perfect sweet spot in your RPMs as ideal for launching at this point. You're not over revving it and you're not under revving it is just right like Goldilocks and the three bears. Yeah, exactly like that. Launch control is when your car's computer limits the RPMs when you're at a standstill. That way you as the driver don't have to worry about over revving or under revving. You trust in the launch control and then you take off. It helps out a ton in racing, which is why it usually comes in a lot of sportier cars. But the cool thing is there are cars that don't come with it, but you could tune it in after as a feature. So is this only for automatics or could you do launch control in a manual? No, there are some manuals That have been tuned to have launch control. It's not common, but it's possible. Huh? Cool. What about two stepping? Is that the same thing? No, it's not. We'll get into that next time.

No, I'm still open options. What's up? Well, I was thinking, man, what if we got matching GTRS? GTR, what is that? I think you didn't drive, man. They're pretty fast. Twin turbo. What's that?

Yo, I got my GTR. No way you did. You know what this means, bro? We can finally match. Well, yeah, technically we'd be matching, but mine looks a lot different. What? What do you mean? Yeah, I think it has some body kit on it. It was a lot more expensive than 200,000, bro. What did you buy? Like a Liberty Walk GTR. How much do you even spend? I don't know what Liberty Walk is, but it was $3 million. Come on, man. Not the GTA prices. Be for real. That is the real price, bro. What did you buy?

My wife Julia walked into our bedroom while I was booking dinner reservations for her birthday next month. She announced, I need you to understand my career comes before this marriage. I stopped typing and looked at her. We've been married for three years, and I'd work double shifts to pay bills while she was in business school. For our marriage? I asked. She rolled her eyes. My mentor, Bradley, says mixing personal life with business is weakness. Real success requires sacrifice, she told me. Bradley had been texting her during dinner lately. From now on, work is the priority. Not birthdays, not holidays, not your needs, he continued. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I already told Bradley you're holding me back, he says. That's typical. She added, wait. She told her mentor I was holding her back after everything I've done? So everything comes second to work? I asked. She nodded firmly. Everything. Bradley made millions by 35 because he never let emotions interfere. I thought about arguing, but decided on something else. That's what you want, I told her. Julia smiled and immediately started texting someone. She thought I'd cave? Nope. Her birthday came three weeks later. Usually I'd plan something special. This year, nothing. She came home to a regular Tuesday. Did you forget? She asked, looking confused. Birthdays are personal. Career comes first, remember? I replied. Her face dropped. But you always do something She said quietly. I shrugged. You said celebrations were distractions. He ordered takeout and ate alone while I watched TV. I heard her on the phone with someone later. No, he didn't do anything. Yeah, I'm alone. She was saying, good. Let her explain that to her friends. Her company's investor gala was next month. We leave at seven, she announced. I stayed on the couch. I'm not going, I told her. She froze. Everyone brings spouses. People will ask questions, he said. You said mixing personal with professional was weakness. I reminded her. She begged. Please, just this once, I asked. Bradley says emotions interfere with success, right? She left alone. My buddy Tom.

Connie was devastated. Bobby moved on and married Sandra D. This marriage was a little bit chaotic. Connie's record label was basically threatening to drop her. But her father, who was just a smitch, controlling, was determined to make her a star. He was like, listen, you need to remake the song who's sorry now? She was over it. She was like, uh, uh. But she did it. Dick Clark played it on American Bandstand and it was a hit. She became an overnight sensation. Even though she found success with her career, her personal life was a little bit messier. Connie was married four times, and none of these marriages stuck. When she was 27, she married a press agent named Dick Connellis. This marriage lasted about four months. Seven years later, she married Izzy Marion. He was a hairdresser. This marriage lasted 10 months. A couple of years later, she married husband No. 3, Joe Garzelli. Together they adopted a son named Joe junior. This was her longest marriage. It lasted five years. But during this marriage, in 1974, when she was 37 years old, she was appearing at a music festival. She returned to her motel. She was brutally assaulted. She was raped. There was a mattress thrown onto her. She almost suffocated.

Even now, 63 years after this single came out, pretty little baby Connie Francis is going viral. Connie was the first true pop star of the rock and roll era. She had 35 Top 40 hits in a decade. She sang in 15 languages. But behind her fame, Connie Francis went through a lot. She was born on December 12, 1937 in Newark, New Jersey. She's a Sagittarius. She was born Concetta Rosa Maria Franconero. Her family, Italian American. Her father George, mother Ida and little brother George junior were all very close. When she was 12 years old, she started singing professionally. She played the accordion guardian and her father would enter her in pageants and talent shows. The next year, she started going by Connie Francis because it was easier to pronounce. When she was just 16, she signed a record deal with MGM Records. Even though she was signed to a label early on, her songs weren't really hitting it. She was hired to be Tuesday Weld's singing voice in the movie Rock, Rock, Rock. Remember I just talked about her? She started working with up and coming singer Bobby Darren. They were both young, starting to get famous and they fell for each other hard. But when her pops found out, he was furious. And as the story goes, he started chasing Bobby around the house with a pew, pew.

I found the messages with her coworker. I waited until their company merger went live, then sent the screenshots to the press. She said it on a Sunday morning over coffee. I've fallen out of love with you. Sunlight through the kitchen window, French roast in the air. Six years together, engaged for eight months. I set down my mug. What? I don't feel it anymore, she said. Eyes her spoon. I think we should end things. My chest went tight. Is there someone else? No, too fast. I just need to be honest with myself. With us. She stirred sugar into her coffee. She'd never liked it. Sweet, okay, I said. Her eyes flicked up, surprised, like she expected me to beg. Okay, if that's how you feel. She moved out that week, took her clothes, her books, half the furniture. I helped her pack. Calm, polite, like we were co workers ending a project. She kept saying she was sorry, that she hoped we could stay friends. I just nodded. The nights after she left were long and silent. I, I couldn't sleep. Just lay there replaying everything frame by frame. Then I remembered her laptop. We shared passwords, devices, accounts. She'd never changed them. I opened her messages and there it was. Months of texts with someone named Marcus, her coworker, just a friend from the office. The messages started friendly, then flirty, then explicit. I can't stop thinking about You last night was incredible. When can we do it again? I scrolled up, trace the timeline. It started four months ago, right when she got busy with work. The night she cancelled our venue visit. She'd been with him. I kept reading, then saw the most recent messages. The merger goes live next month. After that, we can finally be public. Can't wait. No more hiding. The merger, the one she'd been talking about non stop. Marcus VP at the competing company. I sat back, hands shaking, then breathing, then still. I closed the laptop and started planning. For three weeks, I said nothing. Didn't reply to her checking in texts, didn't ask about Marcus, but I was collecting screenshots of every message, every photo, every time stamp. Found out Marcus was married, two kids, his wife's Instagram full of family vacations. I checked his company's ethics policy, relationships between executives forbidden. He signed a morality clause. Scandal equals termination. Perfect. I compiled it all, a neat folder of destruction. Then I waited. The merger announcement was October 15th. Huge press event. Both CEOs, executives from both sides, my ex, Marcus cameras, live streams. A week before she texted me, hey, I know this is weird, but I wanted you to know I'm seeing someone. I hope that's okay. I typed back, that's great. I'm happy for you. She sent a heart emoji. October 15th, I woke early, made coffee, opened my laptop, pulled up emails for three business reporters covering The merger typed one short message, thought you should know about an ethics violation involving two executives at today's merger announcement. Screenshots attached, attached everything. The next, the photos, the timeline. Marcus's claws, his wife's Instagram hit send. 8:00am press conference 10, I turned on the live stream. At 9:55, the ballroom gleamed. Glass podium, corporate banners, flashing cameras. My ex stood to the right in a navy suit, Marcus beside her, confident, perfect. The CEO started his speech. Growth projections, shared vision, synergy. At 10:23, a journalist raised his hand. Excuse me, I have a question about an internal ethics matter. The room quieted. Can you comment on the romantic relationship between two executives here today? He said their names. My ex froze. Marcus's smile vanished. The CEO blinked. What are you referring to? The reporter lifted his phone. We've received explicit messages between them dating back months. It violates both company's ethics codes. Another journalist stood. And Marcus's morality clause signed last year that would void his position. Correct. The CEO's expression turned to stone. He turned to them. Is this true? Marcus stammered. We, it's not. My ex just stood there, eyes wide. The chat feed blew up. Thousands watching live. The CEO whispered to his assistant. Security stepped forward. Sir, ma'am, please come with us, one reporter called out. We've also confirmed Marcus is married, two children. Gasps from the room. Marcus went red. My ex looked like she might faint. The CEO face the cameras. This press conference is over. We will investigate these allegations immediately. The feed cut out. By noon, it was everywhere. Merger implodes amid executive affair scandal. VP fired for violating morality clause. Marcus terminated. My ex spended under review. The merger postponed indefinitely. My phone buzzed non stop. Unknown numbers, reporters asking for comments. I turned it off. That evening she called from another number. I let it ring. Her voicemail, drew, please, I know it was you. You ruined my life, my career, everything. I deleted it. Full story on the channel linked below.

Marcus's claws, his wife's Instagram. Hit send. 8:00am, press conference. 10, I turned on the live stream. At 9:55, the ballroom gleamed. Glass podium, corporate banners, flashing cameras. My ex stood to the right in a navy suit. Marcus beside her, confident, perfect. The CEO started his speech. Growth projections, shared vision, synergy. At 10:23, a journalist raised his hand. Excuse me. I have a question about an internal ethics matter. The room quieted. Can you comment on the romantic relationship between two executives here today? He said their names. My ex froze. Marcus's smile vanished. The CEO blinked. What are you referring to? The reporter lifted his phone. We've received explicit messages between them dating back months. It violates both companies ethics codes. Another journalist stood. And Marcus's morality clause, signed last year, that would void his position. Correct. The CEO's expression turned to stone. He turned to them. Is this true? Marcus stammered. We. It's not my ex. Just stood there, eyes wide. The chat feed blew up. Thousands watching live. The CEO whispered to his assistant. Security stepped forward. Sir, ma'am, please come with us. One reporter called out, we've also confirmed Marcus is married. Two children. Gasps from the room Marcus went red. My ex looked like she might faint. The CEO faced the cameras. This press conference is over. We will investigate these allegations immediately. He cut out. By noon, it was everywhere. Merger implodes amid executive affair scandal. VP fired for violating morality clause. Marcus terminated. My ex suspended. Under review. The merger postponed indefinitely. My phone buzzed non stop. Unknown numbers. Reporters asking for comments. I turned it off. That evening, she called from another number. I let it ring. Her voicemail. Drew, please. I know it was you. You ruined my life, my career, everything. I deleted. Full story on the channel linked below.

I found the messages with her coworker. I waited until their company merger went live, then sent the screenshots to the press. She said it on a Sunday morning over coffee. I've fallen out of love with you. Sunlight through the kitchen window. French roast in the air. Six years together. Engaged for eight months. I set down my mug. What? I don't feel it anymore, she said. Eyes, her spoon. I think we should end things. My chest went tight. Is there someone else? No. Too fast. I just need to be honest with myself. With us. She stirred sugar into her coffee. She'd never liked it sweet. Okay, I said. Her eyes flicked up, surprised, like she expected me to beg. Okay, if that's how you feel. She moved out that week. Took her clothes, her books, half the furniture. I helped her pack. Calm, polite, like we were co workers ending a project. She kept saying she was sorry, that she hoped we could stay friends. I just nodded. The nights after she left were long and silent. I couldn't sleep. Just lay there, replaying everything frame by frame. Then I remembered her laptop. We shared passwords, devices, accounts. She'd never changed them. I opened her messages, and there it was. Months of texts with someone named Marcus. Her coworker. Just a friend from the office. The messages started friendly, then flirty, then explicit. I can't stop thinking about you, Last night was incredible. When can we do it again? I scrolled up, trace the timeline. It started four months ago, right when she got busy with work. The night she canceled our venue visit. She'd been with him. I kept reading, then saw the most recent messages. Merger goes live next month. After that, we can finally be public. Can't wait. No more hiding. The merger. The one she'd been talking about non stop. Marcus. VP at the competing company. I sat back, hands shaking, then breathing. Then still. I closed the laptop and started planning. For three weeks, I said nothing. Didn't reply to her, checking in texts, didn't ask about Marcus. But I was collecting screenshots of every message, every photo, every time stamp. Found out Marcus was married. Two kids, his wife's Instagram full of family vacations. I checked his company's ethics policy. Relationships between executives forbidden. He signed a morality clause. Scandal equals termination. Perfect. I compiled it all. A neat folder of destruction. Then I waited. The merger announcement was October 15th. Huge press event. Both CEOs, executives from both sides. My ex market.

So there's this guy in my grade who's basically allergic to not being the center of attention, like physically cannot handle not being the main character of every situation. He's the type who'd light his shoes on fire if he thought it would get him 5 seconds of fame. Last year, he literally jumped out of a second story window during lunch to impress some girl he barely knew, broke his ankle in three places, got suspended for a month. We all figured that would be his wake up call, you know, like maybe almost breaking his entire leg would teach him that attention isn't worth permanent damage. It didn't. First day back from suspension and he walked into school like he'd won a medal. Everyone was talking about the window thing and you could tell he was loving every second. He had this huge boot on his foot and was milking it for everything it was worth. By third period, I already had a bad feeling about what was coming next. Fast forward to sixth period art class. It's right after lunch. Everyone's half asleep and our teacher is this older lady who's way too trusting for her own good. She leaves the room constantly. This particular day she stepped out to grab more supplies from the storage closet down the hall. The second, and I mean the exact second, that door Clicked shut. This kid's eyes light up. He looks around the room with this expression like he just discovered fire. Then he reaches across the table and grabs two tubes of acrylic paint, bright blue, holds them up over his head like trophies and announces to the entire class, 20 bucks as I can drink both of these right now. The room explodes. Everyone's immediately yelling at him, dude, no, that's literal poison. You're gonna die. But he's already got this grin on his face. I realize with complete horror that he's not joking. This is actually happening. He unscrews the cap off the first tube while we're all still protesting. I legitimately thought he was bluffing like this was some elaborate bit and he chicken out at the last second. He didn't. He tilted his head back, opened his mouth and squeeze that entire tube of paint straight down his throat like it was a go gurt. Bright blue paint. I watched it disappear. The whole class went silent, just staring in disbelief. Then he wiped his mouth, grabbed the second tube and did it again. For a moment, nothing happened. He's standing there.

My daughter Riley, has severe dyslexia. Reading out loud is torture for her. She stumbles over words, takes forever to get through sentences, and kids usually snicker. Her regular teacher, Missus Henderson, understood this and had developed subtle ways to avoid putting Riley on the spot. But last Tuesday, Riley came home sobbing harder than I'd seen in months. Missus Henderson was out sick, and they had a substitute named Miss Williams. This woman had zero understanding of learning disabilities and decided to go around the room having each student read a full paragraph from their history textbook. Riley tried to explain that she had accommodations, but Miss Williams cut her off. Everyone needs to participate equally. No special treatment. So Riley had to stumble through an entire paragraph about the Revolutionary War while 28 kids sat in silence. She said some words backwards, skipped lines, and had to restart three times. The whole ordeal took nearly five minutes. That would have been humiliating enough, but here's where it gets worse. Some kid named Derek thought this was hilarious. While Riley was struggling, he secretly recorded the whole thing on his phone. By lunch, he posted it on social media with crying, laughing emojis and the caption, when you can't even read like a normal person. By the time school ended, half the seventh grade had seen it. Kids were doing impressions. Of Riley's reading voice in the hallways. I was absolutely furious when Riley showed me the video that night. My hands were shaking as I watched my daughter's worst nightmare playing out on a phone screen. I called the school first thing the next morning, ready to unleash hell. The front office transferred me directly to Miss Williams's classroom phone. I started explaining the situation, my voice getting louder with each sentence. I told her about Riley's diagnosis, her accommodations, the humiliation she'd endured. I was building up to demand she be fired when Miss Williams interrupted me. Ma'am, I am so incredibly sorry, she said quietly. I had no idea about Riley's accommodations. I should have asked her. Genuine remorse caught me off guard, but I was still furious about Derek's video. Well, what are you going to do about the kid? Who
