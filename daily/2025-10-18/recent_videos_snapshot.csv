Like you can't be serious that you're blaming some airline company for not making the seats big enough for you. Obviously, you're not gonna fit when you're like 300 kilos overweight and the seats are designed for average person to fit in. And I'm not hating on the ones that have some plus weight because in some cases it's because they have been ill. But the ones that are obese just because they sit all day and eat and do nothing with it because they consider it my life, my rules or whatever are absolutely pathetic. I mean, sure, your body do what you want, but you can't be seriously coming to TikTok and recording yourself how you don't fit in any average human size chair. Also, I have seen multiple videos that say, by the way, this is healthy body and it was not healthy. Trust me. What's even more embarrassing is when fat people post themselves, the comments are full of sunshine. But when some skinny girl posts herself, the 70% of the comments are filled with hate from some fat bitches that are just jealous saying that they have to eat more cause only their bones are showing. It's seriously disgusting and embarrassing how people can hate out of jealousy while not being in the best form themselves. 1, 2, 3, snake oil out.

My family discovered I was good with kids when I was 14 and babysat my cousin once. That single afternoon of watching cartoons turned me into their unpaid nanny for the next 12 years. At first, it was just by my sister dropping off her toddler just for an hour while she ran errands. That hour turned into six when she decided to get her nails done instead. I. I remember sitting on my floor surrounded by broken crayons and goldfish crackers, realizing I missed my shift at the coffee shop. My brother joined in with midnight text about his twins needing an emergency sitter for his concert plans. College, they took it even further. My sister would bang on my dorm door and dump her kids for entire weekends. She cost me my first serious boyfriend when she called me during our anniversary dinner screaming about a fake emergency. My boyfriend looked at me across that candlelit table and said he couldn't do this anymore. After graduation, my parents made everything worse by secretly giving my siblings keys to my apartment. I started coming home from my marketing job to find kids destroying my kitchen and toys taking over my home office. My boss pulled me aside after I'd missed another presentation and told me to figure out my priorities. The moment they took it too far came three months ago when I woke up to voices in my living room. I stumbled out of my pajamas to find four kids watching cartoons with suitcases next to them. My sister's two kids and my brother's twins were all there eating my cereal like it was just another Saturday. On my counter was a note that made my hand shake. My entire family had booked a month long cruise to Europe and decided not to tell me because I'd make it difficult, the note said. They knew I take good care of the kids like I always do. I kept reading it over and over trying to understand how they could just leave the country without even asking me. My sister had attached a grocery list and my brother left $200 for expenses. I was their personal hired help. They could book without notice. The youngest kid looked up and asked if I was making pancakes for breakfast. That innocent question broke something inside me because these kids had no idea their parents had just abandoned them. That's when I decided to teach them what abandonment really felt like. You see, 12 years of forced babysitting had taught me every rule about child welfare and what authorities look for. I made the kids breakfast and told them we were going to play a game where they told me about all the times they stayed with me before. I recorded videos on my phone as they excitedly shared stories about being dropped off for Days without their parents checking in. The seven year old even mentioned the time his mom left him here when he had strep throat. I carefully documented the suitcases, note and the pathetic $200 meant to last a month. Then I looked up the number for Child Protective Services. My family thought they were getting a free month in Europe. Instead, they were about to learn what happens when you abandon your children with someone who knows the system. I called CPS and reported four abandoned minors with no guardianship papers. The caseworker arrived within two hours and went pale reading the note. By afternoon, the kids were in emergency.

I was 18 and technically an adult, but my parents still treated me like I was 12. My mom would go through my backpack every single day when I got home from school, checking my homework like I was in third grade. She'd read my text messages whenever she felt like it. And if I complained, she'd take my phone away for a week. My dad wasn't much better. He had this rule where I couldn't leave the house after six PM even on weekends. If I wanted to hang out with friends, I had to give them a full essay about where I was going, who would be there and when I'd be back. The final straw was when they installed one of those tracking apps on my phone without telling me. I only found out because my friend Jake mentioned seeing my location pop up when he was trying to text me. I confronted them about it that night and my mom just shrugged and said it was for my safety. My dad backed her up, saying as long as I lived under their roof, I followed their rules. Been working at this pizza place since I turned 16, saving up every paycheck except for what I needed for gas and lunch money. By the time I graduated high school, I had almost $4,000 saved up. I started looking at apartments online during my lunch breaks, telling myself I was just browsing. But the More I thought about it, the more I realized I could actually do this. Found this tiny studio apartment about 20 minutes from my job. The rent was only 600 a month and the landlord said if I could prove I had a steady income and pay first month plus deposit, he'd rent to me. I went to look at it on a day my parents thought I was at work. It was small and kind of dingy, but it was mine. I filled out the application that same day. Two weeks later, he called and said I was approved. I could move in the following weekend. That's when it hit me that I was actually doing this. I felt sick to my stomach but also kind of excited. I started slowly moving my stuff out. Every day after work, I'd grab a backpack full of clothes or books and stash them in my car. Told my parents I was staying late to help close the restaurant, which wasn't totally a lie since I was picking up extra shifts to make sure I could afford everything. The hardest part was getting my bigger stuff out. I waited until they went to my aunt's house for Sunday dinner, something I'd gotten out of by saying I had to work. I loaded up my car with my dresser, my desk and my t v, left most of the furniture since it wasn't really mine anyway, but I took the stuff that mattered. I left them a note on the kitchen counter. I kept it simple, told them I'd moved out, that I was safe and that I'd call them in a few days when I was settled. I said I needed space to figure out who I was as an adult and that I hoped they'd understand eventually. I left my house key next to the note. My phone started blowing up around 8 that night, missed calls, texts, voice mails. My mom was crying and half of them my dad was yelling in the others. They wanted to know where I was, if I was okay, why I didn't talk to them first. They said they'd always supported me and couldn't understand why I do this to them. I turned my phone off and didn't turn it back on until the next morning. I had 37 missed calls and way too many texts to read through. I called them back and told them I was fine, gave them my address and said they could come see my place if they wanted. My mom showed up.

Hi, everyone. I'm Sarah Miller and my daughter Tiffany just transferred here today. The chat lit up with a string of welcomes and hellos. Just as I was about to type out my own greeting, a huge block of text appeared. Important notice from Tiffany's mom. Girls in the class, please take note. Starting next week, I'll be posting a picture of what my daughter is wearing each day. Please make sure your child doesn't wear the same thing. Also, I request that everyone please switch to the same brand of laundry detergent we use. My daughter has a very sensitive nose and can't tolerate other scents. Finally, my daughter was a C section baby and is a bit timid. So I ask you to tell your children not to bully her and make sure she's always treated with priority. Wow. I couldn't help but think this isn't just a new student. This is a royal princess who's slumming it with us commoners. Some of the moms in the chat were quick to push back. Karen's mom, are you serious? What my kid wears is none of your business. Why should we have to cater to you? Jessica's mom, exactly. And we're supposed to all use your detergent? My son has allergies, too, and we use specific stuff. Yeah. Who made your kid the queen of the class? My kid is special, too. The chat Quickly devolved into a debate. Usually I just chuckled at the ridiculous things these parents said in the group chat. The class teacher was the administrator and she'd usually step in to calm things down. I didn't see a problem, so I just muted the chat to get some work done. And I got a DM. It was from Alyssa, whose daughter Emily was friends with Lily. Hey, Sarah, you got a.

For as long as I could remember, my younger brother Garrett had been insecure about being weak and scrawny. The LaCrosse team would shove him into lockers daily, calling him Twig Boy. The worst was when he couldn't open a water bottle at lunch and his crush Emily laughed, asking the guy next to her, Garrett's too weak. He needs a man to help him. I always felt bad for him. But the day he discovered one punch man, everything changed. He burst into my room holding his phone showing me Saitama's transformation. Look, he was just like me, a weak, bullied nobody. Then he did the simple training and became the strongest hero alive. I was just happy he found something that gave him hope. The very next morning, Garrett started Saitama's routine religiously, 100 push UPS, 100 sit UPS, 100 squats and a 10 kilometer run every single day. Within two months, his arms showed actual definition and his chest filled out his shirts, the LaCrosse team stopped shoving him around completely. While mom bought him protein powder and dad installed a pull up bar. Look at my dedicated boy. She'd beam at dinner when he shaved his head bald, the school counselor pulled me aside. Whatever is motivating him, it's working. His grades are up, confidence through the roof. Even I was impressed when he bench pressed his body wait for the first time. The best part was Emily starting to notice watching him do pull UPS after school and asking about his anime workout. He flex and quote Sidema, I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun. We all laughed because he was finally becoming the person he wanted to be. But as months passed, things shifted when Garrett demanded everyone call him Sidema. Refusing to Garrett anymore. Teachers got email signed Sidema while he begged mom to legally change his name. When you're 18, she said, this is just a phase. Soon after, he quit soccer because Sidema trained alone and his knuckles stayed permanently stabbed from painting concrete walls in our basement. I'm removing my limiters, he explained, wrapping them in bloody gauze. Now deadlifting 300 pounds, his frame had exploded from 130 to 200 pounds of pure muscle with veins sneaking up his arms like cables. When I tried talking to him about my concerns, he brushed me off. You're getting too intense about this. The whole point is to push past human limits. He showed me his training journal filled with detailed power rankings, strength measurements and notes about breaking through with page after page of Sidema quotes highlighted in yellow. After he passed out doing squats, mom attempted an intervention. Honey, you need rest days. Itama never rested. That's why he transcended. He stormed out to run his 10 kilometer run at midnight. Then the mall incident started a week later when he began picking fights, asking random guys to test His power level until security banned him after the third confrontation. His fist now bore a tattoo reading one punch in bold letters across the knuckles. Six months into his transformation, Garrett looked like a bodybuilder who'd swallowed another bodybuilder. At 220 pounds of carved muscle with shoulders so wide he turned sideways through doorways. We were driving to get groceries on a normal Tuesday morning when he saw a cop conducting a routine traffic stop on the shoulder. Pull over, he said with deadly calm in his voice. What? No, we need to pull over. He grabbed the wheel. This is it, my moment. I pulled over. With shaking hands as he got out and walked toward the officer with purpose. The cop immediately tensed with his hand moving to his whole.

The major's wife grabbed my elbow and steered me past the nice coffee station toward a folding table in the corner where two teenagers sat. She took the ceramic mug from my hand and gave me Styrofoam instead, while her rings dug into my arm. Premium coffee is for senior spouses only. Her eyes went over my ripped jeans and she wrinkled her nose like she smelled something bad. When I opened my mouth to introduce myself, she'd already turned her back to rejoin her group. They leaned in, whispering and looking over their shoulders at me while I stood there holding the cheap cup. My knuckles went white around the Styrofoam as I tried to keep my face calm. The colonel's wife came back and grabbed my orientation packet from the table without asking. She gave me what looked like a kindergarten colouring book with cartoon soldiers and crayons. When deployment came up, she moved her hands like an airplane taking off and said the words really slowly. The major's wife pointed at the wall clock and tilted her head, looking at me, before writing something on her clipboard. Do you even know what branch your husband serves in? She didn't wait for an answer before saying I might be more comfortable with the team dependence next door. Someone else offered me a juice box like I was a little kid at snack Time! My face burned hot, but I kept my expression blank while counting backwards from 10. Before I could respond about the teen group, the major's wife grabbed my hand and tried pulling off my ring to check for inscriptions. Someone actually lifted my shirt looking at my stomach while checking ovulation dates on their phone. The colonel's wife pulled up military dating sites showing me where husbands go when wives get fat. Another started a group chat adding my photo with gold digger alert while they talked about which base brothel soldiers went to overseas. This one definitely poked holes in the condoms. They passed my wedding ring around like evidence while arguing if it was fake or stolen. My jaw hurt from clenching so hard I thought my teeth might crack. Gold digger comment made them all go crazy. They made me stand in the center while they listed every military benefit I was stealing from taxpayers. The major's wife grabbed my phone, scrolling through apps looking for tinder while others said I hung around base bars looking for drunk soldiers to trap. Someone started taking photos of my face for their benefits editor warning page on Facebook. The colonel's wife pushed my phone back at me and leaned in close enough that I could smell her coffee breath mixed with expensive perfume. Which corner did he find you on? Won by the enlisted club. My legs shook as they circled me like they were waiting to attack The room felt smaller every second. The corner comment made them go completely nuts. They backed me against the wall while the major's wife said I was the type who around during deployments. Multiple hands grabbed at my phone, forcing my thumb onto the screen as they went through work emails, yelling about male names. The colonel's wife's nails dug into my cheeks, leaving marks while she made me look at her. Every deployment is your hunting season. They had me stuck there arguing about which base brothels I probably worked at while calling numbers from my contacts. Someone started calling my husband's unit to report cheating. When the door slammed open and secure, he came running in. My vision went fuzzy while every muscle in my body wanted to fight back. The security sergeant stopped dead in the doorway, looking at what was happening. Colonel Silva? The wives still had me stuck against the wall with their hands on me. You know this fraud? That's our K9 commander. She commands the entire working dog unit. The base commander came in behind him looking stressed about something. Where's Colonel Silva? The Pentagon's been. He saw me against the wall, surrounded by military spouses with their hands on me. What the hell

When I was 12 years old, my mother slit her wrists in front of me because I asked to go to a friend's birthday party. And as she bled into our kitchen sink, she made me promise I'd never try to leave her again. She survived that time, barely. While the paramedics worked on her, she gripped my hand with bloody fingers and whispered, this is what happens when you abandon me. I spent three days in the hospital chapel, 13 years old and convinced I'd almost murdered my mother by wanting to go to a sleepover. When she came home, arm bandaged and eyes hollow, she made let me sleep in her bed so she could hold on to me all night. I need to know you're here, she said. Otherwise, the darkness comes back. The rules formed quickly after that. I couldn't join clubs because staying late at school feels like you're choosing them over me. I couldn't have friends over because their energy disrupts our bond. Each boundary came with the same threat, sometimes spoken, sometimes just a gesture toward her scarred wrists. She kept razors displayed on the bathroom counter like weapons, reminding me what would happen if I broke her heart again. By 14, I was homeschooled and complete. Completely isolated. Mom said it was better this way. Just us two against a world that didn't understand our connection. She'd have good days where she'd braid my Hair. And we'd watch movies. And I think maybe this was enough. But then I'd mention wanting to learn to drive someday, and she'd go silent. She'd lock herself in the bathroom, and I'd sit outside the door, begging her to come out. She'd emerge hours later, showing me fresh cuts on her thighs. Practice cuts, she'd call them. For when you finally abandoned me for real. I attempted my first real escape at 15. I found a youth shelter address at the library and memorized it. One night while mom slept, I packed a bag and made it to the front door. But she was sitting in the dark living room, waiting. I felt you pulling away, she said calmly. Then she swallowed an entire bottle of sleeping pills in front of me. I called 9 1 1 and rode with her to the hospital, holding her hand while they pumped her stomach. When she woke up, she smiled sadly. You did this, she said. But at least you stayed to watch. After that, she installed bells on my bedroom door and windows. She test me randomly, pretending to hurt herself to see if I try to leave or just save her. I always chose to save her. But I was dying inside, suffocating under the weight of keeping her alive. I started writing goodbye letters I never send, hiding them in my textbooks. I. I tried to get away again when I was 16. Mom had fallen asleep. After taking anxiety medication, and I thought I had time, I made it three blocks before a police car pulled up. Mom had called them claiming I was mentally unstable. She'd shown them my hidden letters as evidence. As they drove me home, she texted me, if you'd kept going, you would have found my body when you came back. I had the bath ready that night. She showed me a new scar on her stomach. I did this while you were gone, she said. She made me help her bandage it, narrating how she would have cut deeper if I made it another block. Next time you leave, she promised, I'll make sure I time it perfectly. You'll be free, but you'll be a murderer. I became hyper vigilant, watching for signs she was spiraling. My entire existence became keeping her from the edge. When I caught her standing on our apartment balcony at 3:00am, I didn't ask why. I just took her hand and let her back to bed. But then I got a scholarship to art school. Mom found the acceptance letter before I could hide it. She didn't say anything, just disappeared into the bathroom. I heard water running and pounded on the door. When she finally

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos and that smug smile that made me wanna run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, Nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of, reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp already wearing work clothes, even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he just say, what's next, sir? One Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me, because she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd.

In my family, we had something called Health Day. Every Saturday morning at 9:00am sharp, we'd finish breakfast and dad would already have the basement ready with his white coat on and all his medical equipment laid out on metal trays in the basement. Our mom would kiss our foreheads before sending us down one by one. Then came the examinations. Thorough inspections of every inch of our bodies while he muttered medical terms and scribbled in thick blue binders. He'd make us stand naked under the bright lights while he circled us slowly, his gloved fingers pressing into our skin, checking what he called abnormalities. He called it preventative care. I dreaded it. Every single week. The rule was you couldn't flinch or complain or you'd start over from the beginning. The strangest part? We weren't allowed to mention health day at school. Not to teachers, not to friends. I only realised in middle school how weird that was. How other kids just went to pediatricians once a year, not secret basement clinics every week. But the worst part was the special examinations. If dad found something concerning during the regular check, you'd get called down. On week nights, he had this small locked room with bright lights and an exam table with stirrups. The metal was always cold and he'd spend what felt like hours with his instruments, documenting every detail while telling us to relax and breathe. He said it Was for comprehensive assessment. As a kid, I was terrified. I'd count the ceiling tiles over and over. But dad said fear meant you were taking your health seriously. When I got older, I started questioning everything. Why did we need weekly exams when no one else did? Why did mom drink before every health day? I remember once, at 14, I asked if I could skip it for Rachel's sleepover. Dad gripped my wrist and stared at me with these desperate eyes. Health Day is the only thing keeping you safe, he said. That's when I knew something was deeply wrong. Rachel's family had annual checkups, vaccination schedules, growth charts on the fridge. No basement procedures, no locked rooms, no binders documenting their bodies. Just normal healthcare. I finally refused to go downstairs when I turned 16. Dad went ballistic, screaming that I was ungrateful and didn't understand the dangers. Mom just stood there shaking. He locked me in my room and said I couldn't leave until I submitted to a full examination the next morning. Mom slipped me $20 under the door and whispered to use the window. When I came back that night, dad acted like nothing had happened. He just asked if I was ready for my examination, like he hadn't imprisoned me the night before. That's when I started planning. The whole thing ate at me. Why was dad so obsessed with our health when he wasn't even a doctor? Where did he get all That equipment. Three months later, I told my health teacher everything. Patterson kept her face very still as I explained our Saturday routine. She said she needed to make a phone call. I knew what that meant. She came back with the principal. Then the police came. Then child services. They took us out of class one by one. Just like health day. Except this time, we didn't go home. I'll never forget Dad's face when they arrested him. Not angry, just broken. I was protecting them, he kept saying. The officers found the binders. Dozens

I'm sitting at my reserved table at this fancy Italian place when a couple walks up and says, excuse me, you're at our table. I politely tell them I have a seven PM reservation under my name. The woman rolls her eyes and says as well. We have one too, and we were here first. I show them my confirmation email. The guy gets aggressive, look, we eat here every week. The hostess knows us. You need to move. The woman adds, we tip really well here. They know to take care of us. I refuse and say, I'm not moving for my confirmed reservation. The guy starts raising his voice, this is ridiculous. We're regulars. Other diners start looking over. The woman notices, and it's louder. Can you believe this? Some people have no courtesy. I flag down our waitress, hoping she'll check the reservation system. She walks over looking nervous. The couple immediately pounces, thank god you're here. This person took our usual table. The waitress looks between us awkwardly, oh, there might have been a mix up. Maybe you could sit at the bar. The couple Smurfs like they've won. The woman crosses her arms. See? Even she knows this is our table. The guy adds, we've been coming here for three years, same table every Friday. I'm getting heated, but stay calm and ask the waitress to check her system. He hesitates and says, well, they Are very good customers. The woman jumps in. Exactly. We spend serious money here, not like some random walk in. I tell her I'm not a walk in and show my confirmation again. The guy dismisses it. Anyone can fake an email these days. The woman suggests, why don't you just go somewhere else? There are plenty of other restaurants. Other customers are now openly staring at the scene. One couple at the next table starts whispering. The waitress looks uncomfortable and suggests again, the bar has really nice seating, same menu. The guy nods, approving. Perfect solution. Everyone's happy. I refuse to budge and ask to speak to the manager. The woman laughs. Oh please, he knows us personally. The guy adds, we had dinner with him last month. Good luck with that. The waitress says the manager is busy in the kitchen. The couple exchanges knowing looks. The woman leans in. Look, we can make this easy or hard. Your choice. I ask what that means. The guy explains, we know the owner. One word from us and you'll never get a table here again. I stand my ground and say I'm keeping my legally reserved table. The couple gets more aggressive. The woman starts talking to nearby tables. You believe? Some people. No respect for loyalty. The guy joins. In three years we've been coming here. This is what customer service has become. A man at another table nods sympathetically. The woman turns back to me. Last Chance. Move, or we'll make sure everyone knows how selfish you are. That's when I pull out my phone and call the restaurant. Right there in front of everyone. Hi, this is Johnny. I made a reservation for seven PM under Johnson. There's some confusion about my table. The couples come. Confidence wavers slightly. The guy whispers, what is he doing? The hostess who seated the couple answers. I put it on speaker so everyone can hear. Oh, Mister Johnson. Yes, table 12 is definitely yours. Wait, someone else

I pretended to be my cousin, the substitute teacher for a day and accidentally got my dream job. I was 19, broke as hell and still waiting to hear back from community college. My cousin Tyler was a substitute teacher who sometimes paid me to drive him around since his car was trash. One Tuesday morning he calls me freaking out, dude, I just rear ended someone. I'm supposed to be at Westbrook Middle School in 20 minutes. If I miss another day, they'll cut me from their sub list. I was eating cereal in my pajamas. That sucks, man. Wait, he said, you still have my school I d from when you helped me move those boxes last month? Yeah. Why? I'm serious. Let's go. Pretend to be me. Take attendance. Keep them quiet. It's just study hall. I laughed. You're insane. Please. They won't even check. Most subs just sit there anyway. It's one period. Something about the desperation in his voice got to me, plus I needed money. I threw on Tyler's spare button down shirt that was way too big and drove to the school with his laminated badge. The front desk lady barely looked up. You must be the sub for Miss Peterson's class, room 2, 13. Here's your clipboard. I walked down that hallway trying to look confident while my heart was pounding. The kids were loud but not crazy. I took attendance, reading names. Off the roster. When they asked where their teacher was, I said she had a family emergency and today was independent study. Can we work on homework, this girl asked. Absolutely, I said, having no clue what else to tell them. For an hour, I just walked around pretending to supervise while they did whatever. Some kid asked me about math and I said I'd get back to him. Another wanted to use the bathroom and I let like five kids go because I didn't know the rules. The bell rang and a whole new group of kids walked in. Nobody had told me there were multiple periods. I panicked but tried to play it cool. Same routine, independent study day. The projector wasn't working, so sorry, no video today. I made them read silently and told them I'd be grading papers instead. I just stared at Tyler's lesson plan book trying to figure out what I was supposed to be doing. Third period came, then fourth. I was making it up as I went. When kids got too loud, I'd say stuff like, remember, this affects your participation grade, even though I had no idea how grading worked. During lunch, I hid in an empty classroom and texted Tyler updates. He kept saying, you're doing great, just get through the day. Fifth period, this kid asked me about the Revolutionary War assignment. I panicked and said, what do you think the most important battle was? Then I made them Debate it while I googled stuff on my phone under the desk. By 6th period, I was actually getting comfortable. These kids weren't that different from my little brother and his friends. I started a trivia game about random stuff and they were actually into it. Then the assistant principal walked in my

My cousin Ellen texted me last night at 11 p m. The kids are so excited to be vampires at your party tomorrow. I nearly dropped my phone. I never invited her kids. Not after what happened last year. For context, I've hosted an elaborate Halloween party for the past five years. It's my. I think I spent months planning the decorations, curating the perfect playlist, and mixing signature cocktails. My friends look forward to it all year. Last October, Ellen called me crying because her babysitter canceled last minute. Please, I haven't been out in months. But twins will behave, I promise. They're better now. Against my better judgment, I said yes. I mean, how bad could a couple of seven year olds be? Catastrophic. As it turns out, within 20 minutes of arriving, they were running laps around my apartment. Ellen just sipped her drink and chatted, completely oblivious. The first disaster happened when they decided to play hot lava and jumped from my couch to my antique coffee table. The table, a 2 hundred year old family heirloom my grandmother left me, collapsed under their weight. Ellen barely looked up. Kids will be kids. He shrugged. An hour later, I found them in my bedroom dumping out my makeup collection onto my white bedspread. We're doing monster makeup, they announced, proudly, covered in my fifty dollar foundation. While I was Cleaning up the makeup disaster, they somehow got into the Halloween candy I had set aside for trick or treaters. They not only devoured most of it, but also fed several chocolate bars to my dog, pepper. By midnight, pepper was violently ill. I had to leave my own party to rush her to the emergency vet. The Bill? $600. When I returned home at 3:00am, exhausted and worried about pepper, I discovered one of the twins had gotten sick and vomited directly into my fish tank. Surprise Betta fish, the one I'd raised from a tiny fry, was floating at the top the next morning. Ellen's response to all this destruction. They were over tired. You shouldn't have so many breakable things if you're going to invite children. I didn't invite children. She invited them. So this year, I sent beautifully designed invitations with adults only written in bold Gothic lettering at the top. I even called Ellen specifically to

She seemed fine with it at the time. Yet here we were the night before my party and she'd forgotten that crucial detail. I typed back, sorry, Ellen, no kids allowed. Remember what happened last year? My apartment still hasn't recovered. Her response appeared instantly. They were just being children. Besides, I already bought their costumes and told them they're going to Aunt Katie's spooky party. You wouldn't disappoint kids on Halloween, would you? That's just cruel. Actually, I would. And I wasn't about to let emotional manipulation ruin another Halloween. Instead of arguing further, I had a better idea. My neighbour, Mike, works as a professional clown for children's parties. But here's the thing about Mike. He's 6 4, covered in tattoos and has this naturally intense stare. Kids are terrified of him. Despite his best efforts to be friendly, I called Mike and explained my situation. He laughed and agreed to help for $200 and unlimited access to my Halloween punch. Next evening, as my adult guests began arriving, Mike took up his position on my front porch. He wore his standard clown costume but with blood splatters added to his white makeup and carried a sign that read, adults only party. Children will be entertained by me on the porch. At exactly seven thirty PM, Ellen's minivan pulled into my driveway. I watched through the window as she parked and started unloading her vampire twins. Then she spotted Mike sitting eerily still on my Porch swing, slowly twisting a balloon animal while staring directly at her car. The look on her face was priceless. She frantically rolled up the car windows and locked the doors. The twins were pressing their faces against the glass, their vampire makeup now streaked with tears. Ellen reversed so quickly she knocked over my mailbox in her escape. My phone lit up with a furious text. What kind of sick joke is this? I simply replied, adults only means adults only. Enjoy your evening. The party was perfect. No broken heirlooms, no emergency vet visits and not a single fish was harmed. Mike turned out to be the hit of the party. He makes incredible balloon martini glasses. Ellen hasn't spoken to me since, but several family members have thanked me privately. Apparently, I'm not the first victim of her. Kids will be kids parenting style.

The invitation said cocktail attire, and I had this gorgeous white dress that I bought for my cousin's rehearsal dinner but never got to wear. Here's the thing, though. It wasn't wedding dress white. It was more like cream colored with tiny silver dots all over it. I paired it with a navy blazer and navy shoes. I thought I looked appropriate and classy. My roommate even said I looked great when I left that morning, I got to the church about 15 minutes before the ceremony started. The. The moment I walked in, I felt every single person's eyes on me. The ushers kind of froze when they saw me, and this older woman in the front row actually gasped out loud. I started to panic, but figured maybe I was just imagining things. Then Jake's mom spotted me. She marched over in her purple mother of the groom dress, grabbed my arm, and whispered, what on earth were you thinking? I was so confused. I asked her what she meant, and she just stared at my dress like I had shown up naked. That's when it hit me. White dress wedding. Oh, no. I Tried to explain that it was cream, not white, and I had a blazer, but she wasn't having it. She told me I needed to leave immediately or she'd have security escort me out. I was mortified. But then Jake appeared from the back room where he was getting ready. He saw the commotion and came over. His mom started explaining the situation to him, pointing at my dress like it was evidence in a crime scene. Jake looked at me, then at his mom, then back at me.

Like, you want me to be pregnant for 9 months, bro? I can barely survive school. Is there a build a baby shop? Cause I also low key want to customize my baby. Like, yeah, I want the little curly hair and chubby cheeks combo. Maybe give them my sarcasm and someone else's math skills because I've been failing since birth. I don't wanna do the freaky either. Like why is that step even required? Why do I have to risk my soul insanity in a sweaty emotional situation just to unlock the baby starter pack? The fact people would know I did too. And the way people say, but it's all worth it in the end. Like, girl, that's what they say after surviving a car crash. You're not convincing me to grow a human like it's a houseplant when I literally forget to feed myself some days. I'm not stable enough to be a life factory. And why is no one talking about the fact that you don't even get a break after the baby's born? Like now you get to wake up every 2 hours and get screamed at by a bald roommate with anger issues. I just want the baby. I want to dress them like a minion and send them to preschool with a juice box. But I want to skip the pregnancy part, skip the pain, skip the loading screen, give Me the kid, just spawn them in. At this point, every time I hear someone say I miss being pregnant, I start glitching. Miss what?

I don't even read the instructions on frozen waffles and now I'm supposed to build a whole human from scratch. And don't even get me started on baby names cause I already know I'd name my kid something adorable and then he'd grow up to be a middle school menace with a mullet and a scooter who calls teachers by their first name. I'm not risking all that just to have my custom baby turn out like a Fortnite sweat who screams into a headset and tells other 12 year olds you're trash while I'm in the back crying over how I spent 9 months assembling this child just for him to rage quit over losing in Roblox OBBY Level 2 and the emotions. I crashed out yesterday because my charger fell behind the bed. Now imagine me pregnant.

I discovered my wife was cheating when the kids mentioned Uncle Steve. Have been helping mommy feel better at night. The betrayal hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, but I knew staying would destroy me, so I filed for divorce. During the proceedings, I practically begged her to be reasonable about custody. She looked me in the eyes and said, I would never keep your children from you for six months. She actually kept her word, and we fell into this decent routine where we'd exchange the kids every Friday without any drama. She'd even text me little updates about their school days, and we managed to sit together at their soccer games like normal divorced parents. But then I pulled up for my regular Friday pickup, and there was a for sale sign in the yard, and the house was completely empty. I actually fell to my knees on their lawn because I knew she'd done it. She'd actually taken my kids. I called her phone over and over, but it just rang. When I gave up, I noticed the notification for a voicemail that came at 6:00am. Her voice was casual, saying, we've relocated to Seattle for Steve's job, and the kids are already enrolled in school. Like she was telling me about changing their soccer practice time. I sat in that driveway for an hour, dissociating, because she'd been planning on moving 3,000 miles. Away for months while looking me in the eye every Friday. The next morning, a process server handed me court papers claiming I was an absent father who prioritized work over my children. And I realized she'd also been documenting my business trips, kept calling and texting, begging to just hear my kids voices. It actually took three days for me to get through to her. She answered, and instead of explaining anything, she offered monthly video calls like she was being generous.

My sister in law Kelly had her first miscarriage about six months ago. It was devastating. I get that. The whole family rallied around her and my brother Jake, bringing casseroles and giving them space to grieve. But then she started acting like she was the only person who'd ever lost a baby. It started small. At family dinners, she'd make comments about how nobody understood what real loss felt like. When my cousin Amanda talked about her dog dying, Kelly rolled her eyes and said that's not the same thing at all. When my mom mentioned missing my grandpa who died last year, Kelly literally scoffed and said, you got to say goodbye to him. Though the worst part was how she treated me. I've been married to my husband Chris for 8 years and we don't have kids yet. Kelly started making these passive aggressive comments about how lucky I was to not have to worry about these things, how I couldn't possibly understand what she was going through. Last weekend was my nephew's birthday party. Kelly seemed okay during most of it, playing with the kids and laughing at their jokes. But then my brother's friend brought up how his wife was pregnant and Kelly's whole mood shifted. She got quiet and started picking out her food. Later when we were in the kitchen cleaning up, Kelly started talking. About how hard it was seeing pregnant women everywhere. I tried to be supportive, telling her I understood how triggering that must be. That's when she snapped. No, you don't understand, she said, her voice getting louder. You have no idea what it's like to lose a baby. You've never even been pregnant. You don't know what real loss feels like. Something inside me just broke. I've been holding this in for years, keeping it private because Chris and I decided we didn't want the.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight, be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I I turned onto our street, there was a black infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walking up like he'd done it before. Becca opened. Before he could ring, they kissed the kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too. I needed to do something else, something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe, how was your night? Good. You know how it is. The next two Thursdays I kept my routine but park down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage and that's when it hit me. The man was Mark. Mark who supposedly moved to Seattle two years Ago my knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped the bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for boys night when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Mark was great. You guys still text though, right? Sometimes. The next morning she woke up different with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors. And since it was Thursday during lunch, she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew the comment about Mark got her. Probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old after work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then picking it back up at 7:15. She practically pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time there was no car that showed up. And at nine fifteen, becca's own car pulled out. I followed her. First stop, o'malley's sports bar, where she thought i'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused, taking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop, the dugout, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer, this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone, probably my picture. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly prime sports bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms, heard her say every.

What makes you special? When I was 11, I started noticing this weird thing. Whenever someone lied to me, my tongue would tingle like when you lick a battery. The first time it happened was at school when my friend Mia said she didn't take my pencil. My tongue buzzed like crazy and later I found it in her desk. I thought it was just in my head, but it kept happening. In middle school, when kids said they didn't copy my homework, buzz. When they claimed they weren't talking about me behind my back, buzz. By 8th grade, I realised I had some kind of superpower, but it freaked me out. I stopped shaking hands with people because what if they were lying about something and I could taste it? I stopped eating at potluck because what if someone lied about washing their hands? My classmates already thought I was weird, so I never told anyone. But my gift made me unbeatable at group projects and friend drama. People thought I just had really good instincts about people. I didn't correct them. Then junior year happened and everything changed. My mom had been dating this guy, Trevor for about 6 months. He was one of those smooth talkers who remembered everyone's birthday and always brought flowers. Mom was totally smitten. But every single time Trevor opened his mouth around me, my tongue went fuzzy. Not just a little tingle, but full on electric Shock mode when he said he loved spending time with our family. Buzz when he complimented my mom's cooking. Buzz when he claimed he was just looking out for us. Buzz, Buzz, Buzz. The guy was a walking lie detector nightmare. I tried telling my mom about my bad vibes, but she brushed it off as teenage attitude. She said I was just protective and needed to give him a chance. But I knew something was wrong. One afternoon I came home early from school and caught Trevor in my room. He was holding my tablet, scrolling through it like he owned the place. When he saw me, he didn't even look embarrassed. Hey, kiddo, just checking this for viruses, he said with that fake smile. Your mom asked me to make sure you're staying safe online. My tongue practically exploded. The buzzing was so intense I could barely think straight. He was lying through his teeth. My mom would never ask you to do that, I said. He shrugged. She worries about you. You know how moms are more buzzing. I grabbed my tablet from him and told my mom everything when she got home. But Trevor had already spun some story about me being disrespectful and trying to cause problems in their relationship. Mom took his side. That's when I decided to set a trap. I left my tap.

So I let go completely. Two years later, I walked into that house party with a crowd that left her absolutely stunned. Regina ended it twice. First time at her apartment after dinner. I need space. You're always here, always texting, always needing to know where I am. Second time when I tried to fix things a month later. You're too clingy. You have no life outside of us. That word destroyed me. Clingy, like loving someone completely was a character flaw. Three days later, she was already posting stories with hunter, one of our mutual friends from the group. The same hunter who'd been at every game night, every birthday, every random Tuesday hangout. They weren't even subtle about it. Same coffee shop we used to go to, same booth, same drinks. Except now hunter was sitting where I used to be. Our entire friend group just rolled with it. Hunter and Regina just clicked. They'd say like I'd never existed. Like three years of being part of their circle meant nothing. Lorelei, who I helped move twice, suddenly couldn't text back. Graham, who'd crashed at my place countless times, acted like we'd never met. They chose side without anyone asking them to, was completely alone. No girlfriend, no friends, no weekend plans, no one to text stupid memes to. So I did the only thing I could, started saying yes to everything. Coworker mentioned, a hiking group. Yes. Random gym buddy. Invited me to trivia night. Yes. Neighbor needed someone for their recreational basketball team. Absolutely. Yes. The hiking group LED to Anna, Declan and Carlos, three people who actually wanted to hang out. Trivia night introduced me to an entire crew of movie nerds who did weekly screenings. Basketball connected me to guys who grabbed beers without making it feel like an obligation. Within six months, I had three different group chats going, multiple invites every weekend. Inside jokes with people who didn't know Regina existed. He knew me as the guy who was always down for whatever, not the clingy ex who got dumped. While I was building an actual life, Regina and hunter were imploding. According to Instagram, their posts went from constant to sporadic couple photos replaced with solo shots. Hunter's friends would occasionally mention drama when I ran into them. She's jealous of everyone. Can't handle him having other friends. Sound familiar? A year and a half in, I met Zoe at a concert my new friends dragged me to. She was there with her roommates dancing like nobody was watching. We talked between sets about the most random things. She collected vintage postcards, had opinions about every food truck in the city, made me laugh until my sides hurt. When she asked for my number, she said it was because I seemed like someone with good friend group energy. Four months of dating before the universe decided to be hilarious. Her roommate Rachel, was dating Someone named Graham. Yeah, that Graham, my former friend who'd ghosted me when Regina chose hunter. When Zoe mentioned meeting Rachel's boyfriend's.

So I drove him straight into another state while he slept. Mr Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper just to throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he always had his favourite line. In the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into the driver's ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my stomach dropped like a stone. Where do I turn, I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise, though with your steering straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchange looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight. With you girls never know. When we're gonna stop or if we're gonna stop. By the third lesson we discovered his pattern. He'd make his nasty jokes for 20 minutes, then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practiced highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed said. When I beard slightly, I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife if we survive today's lesson. That is 3 teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon, Sophia slightly bearded and he exploded. Jesus, are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know, girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high and why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My 5 year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I, and then he was snoring, head tilted back against the headrest. I looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realised he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up On the right and I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five north hanging over the highway. Like a dare, I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering. I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added, me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank. Back at the sleeping Mister Maya. And as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. Thirty minutes passed, then an hour and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up. Con.

My roommate Lisa was doing her nightly skincare routine when we heard glass breaking downstairs. She just applied a thick green face mask and was wearing her ratty bathrobe with hair and rollers. Did you hear that? I whispered. Lisa grabbed her phone to call 9 1 1, but then got this evil grin. I have a better idea. She crept to the top of the stairs and let out the most blood curdling scream I've ever heard, then started speaking in tongues. Literally just gibberish that sounded vaguely Latin. Spiritus Malum, enter this vessel. I heard the burglar drop something and curse. Lisa crawled down the stairs backwards like the girl from the Exorcist, still screaming in her made up demon language. The green face mask was cracking, making her look legitimately terrifying. The burglar was backing toward the window when our other roommate, Ben, emerged from his room. He immediately caught on. The possession is spreading! He yelled. Everyone get the salt! Ben started throwing table salt everywhere while chanting the Pokemon theme song in a deep, ominous voice. The burglar was now pressed against the wall. Our TV forgotten on the floor. Please, he begged. I'll leave. I'm sorry. Lisa's head snapped toward him. She put in her glow in the dark Halloween contacts. In the dim light, her eyes were literally glowing green. You disturbed the ritual, she growled. That's when our fourth roommate, Kevin Joined in. He emerged, playing his violin badly, just screeching notes while swaying like he was in a trance. The demons need music! Ben shouted, now drawing symbols on the wall with ketchup. Play louder! The burglar tried to run, but Lisa's spider walked toward him at surprising speed. He actually screamed. I need an old priest and a young priest, I yelled, getting into it. I'm Protestant! The burglar cried. I don't know any priests! Lisa stood up suddenly, did a perfect backbend and whispered, then you're screwed! The man literally wet himself. I saw the stain spreading on his jeans. Kevin's violence screeching intensified. Ben was now speaking in Klingon. Lisa started doing that creepy clicking sound from the grudge. The burglar fell to his knees. What do you want from me? Your soul, Lisa hissed. Or your confession. I'll confess. I've robbed 12 houses. I'll tell you everything! He started listing addresses, eightes where he'd sold stuff. Ben was frantically taking notes while still pretending to be possessed. When the cops arrived, they found a burglar in tears, begging for an exorcist. Lisa, still in full green face mask and glowing contacts. Catch up! Demon symbols on our walls! Kevin playing my heart will go on badly on violin. Ben reading the burglar his rights and clanging on. The burglar immediately confessed to everything, begged the cops to take him to a church instead of jail. Kept asking if we were really human. The officer looked at Lisa. Ma'am, what exactly happened here? Skincare night, she said sweetly. Very important for your pores. They took the burglar away. He was muttering about the green demon and violin of the damned. Cops came back later for our statements. One of them finally cracked. In 20 years on the force, I've never had a perp bag for holy water in the squad car. Turns out the burglar had been hitting houses in our area for months. His full confession cleared over a dozen cases. The detective said whatever you did probably saved him from years more crime. He found religion real quick. Already signed up for seminary school. Lisa's review of her faith.

I spent 15 years building the internet infrastructure for our small town in Nebraska. Everyone knew me as the internet guy. When your Wi-Fi went down at 2:00am, you called me. When you wanted faster speeds for your home office, I was your guy. What most people didn't know was that I didn't work for some big company. I owned every cable, every tower and every router box in town. I was the provider. Everything started falling apart when Jerry Davidson got elected to City Council. This guy had been gunning for me ever since I refused to give him free internet for his campaign office two years earlier. At the first town meeting, Jerry stood up with this big presentation about bringing in competition. I need options, he said, pointing at charts showing how much cheaper national providers were. Alex has had a monopoly too long. The new company, Net Connect, rolled into town with promises nobody could refuse, half the price, double the speeds and a name people recognized from TV commercials. They set up a booth at the farmers market offering gift cards just for signing up. Within three months, I watched my customer base get cut in half. By six months, I had maybe 30 customers left out of 800. People stopped waving when they saw me around town. Mrs. Henderson, who used to bring me cookies every Christmas, wouldn't even make eye contact. At the grocery store, Pete's Diner. Conversations would stop when I walked in. Some people actually laughed when Jerry made jokes about my outdated service during council meetings. I tried everything. Lowered my prices below cost, offered free installation, threw in premium channels. Nothing worked. Net connected poisoned the well. My savings account hit zero. My girlfriend Katie left me for some guy who worked at the bank. My business was circling the drain and I was three months behind on my truck payment. That's when I started reading contracts real carefully. See, Net Connect had signed a deal with the city to run their fiber cables through existing infrastructure. They were using my utility poles, my access boxes, and most importantly, my signal towers. The contract gave them access, but only if I granted maintenance permissions. Harry had been so excited to stick it to me that he never bothered reading the fine print. When the city originally gave me exclusive rights to install towers 15 years ago, I wrote a clause that let me shut down signal access with 60 days notice. Back then, it seemed like a smart way to protect my investment. Now it was my nuclear option. I spent three nights going through every page of every contract that connects infrastructure piggyback completely on my original network backbone. They never laid fresh lines because it would have cost millions. They just plugged into what I'd already built and called it an upgrade. On a Tuesday morning, I walked into City Hall. And filed my 60 day notice to terminate signal access. Harry was there picking up some paperwork and saw me at the counter. He asked what I was doing with a smug grin on his face. Just some routine maintenance paperwork, I told him. Netconnect's lawyers showed up exactly one week later.

So I went to this Applebee's last Friday night around eight PM I get seated at this booth near the back and my waiter comes over. Guy looked like he was in his early 20s, kind of scrawny with this patchy beard. He takes my drink order, just a Coke, and disappears. For like 15 minutes I'm sitting there looking around, watching other tables get their food and I'm still waiting for my damn soda. Finally, he shows up with my Coke, doesn't even apologize, just flops it down and asks what I want to eat. I order the chicken tenders with honey mustard and seasoned fries. Pretty basic stuff. He writes it down and vanishes again. 20 minutes go by, nothing. I can see him at the computer terminal just standing there scrolling on his phone. Other waiters are running around actually doing their jobs, but this guy is just chilling. I try to get his attention a couple times, but he's completely ignoring my section. After another 10 minutes, I flag down a different waitress, older lady with gray hair who looked like she actually cared about her job. I asked her if she knows what happened to my food order. She looks confused and goes to check. Turns out my waiter never even put my order in the system. The lady, her name tag said Janet, looked embarrassed as hell. She apologizes and immediately puts my order In says the kitchen will rush it. But now I've been sitting there for almost an hour with nothing but a warm Coke. My food finally comes out, but guess who brings it? Not my original waiter. Janet brings it over with another apology. The chicken tenders are overcooked and the fries are cold. At this point, I'm just hungry and tired, so I eat it anyway. The whole time I'm eating, I can see my waiter at the bar area talking to some girl who's clearly not working there. He's completely forgotten I exist. Never checked on me once after taking my drink order, never refilled my Coke, never even walked past my table. When I'm done eating, I have to wave down Janet again to get my check. He brings it over and I can tell she feels bad about the whole situation. The total was like 18 bucks. Here's where it gets interesting. Janet hands me the check and quietly says, don't worry about tipping Tommy. He didn't earn it tonight and everyone saw what happened. Apparently, this wasn't the first time this kid had pulled this crap. So I pay my $18 cash exact change and leave zero tip as I'm walking.

The grocery store security footage showed my face hitting the floor. Blood pooled around my head where I cracked it on the tile. When I woke up in the hospital, I immediately threw up blood. You're literally starving to death, the doctor told me. I tried to sit up, but the room spun violently. I need to get back to work. Rent is due tomorrow. She pushed me back down. You're 16 years old and you weigh 80 pounds. Can't be right. When did you last eat a meal? Three days ago, I think. She looked horrified. Where are your parents right now? In the basement, playing their online game, like always. They don't know you're dying? They told me not to bother them unless someone is dead. You almost were dead. Almost doesn't count according to them. She glanced at my chart. You work two jobs and go to school. I work at four in the morning delivering newspapers, then I go to school, then I work at the grocery store until midnight. That it's physically impossible. Red Bull and gas station pills make it possible. You're taking stimulant. I have to pay rent or we get evicted. Your parents don't have jobs? They quit two years ago to become professional gamers. Are they making money from gaming? I laughed. They've made exactly zero dollars. Keep saying fame is coming any day now. How much sleep are you getting? My thoughts kept slipping away like water through my fingers. Three hours on a good night, but usually less. Do you ever feel dizzy or confused? Every single day. But I can push through it. She stared at me in disbelief. Your parents make you work while they stay home gaming all day? They're trying to build their streaming career. They need my support. She examined my arms, which looked like twigs. 40 pounds underweight because you're feeding them instead of yourself. You don't understand. They should be able to follow their dreams after the sacrifices they made for me. My manager, Jimmy, had been sitting in the corner listening. He finally spoke up, looking sick with guilt. I should have said something sooner. This kid has been falling apart for months. He has been seeing things at work that aren't real. The doctor turned to him quickly. What kind of things? Yeah. he was having full conversations with nobody for 20 minutes straight. I felt my face get hot. Sometimes when I'm really tired, I see shadows that aren't there. That's your brain literally shutting down from exhaustion. Jimmy looked broken. And last week I found him unconscious in the freezer. He had been in there for 40 minutes and had blue lips. I was just resting my eyes. You could have died. But I didn't, so it's fine. The doctor checked my blood work again. Your body is failing and you're still defending them? They're my parents. I owe them everything. You don't owe them your life. Without me, they'll be homeless. Without them, you'd be healthy. The doctor called Child Protective Services and a social worker arrived within an hour. They tried calling my parents 23 times before anyone answered. The doctor put them on speaker so the social worker could record everything. I could hear battle sounds and screaming from their game in the background. This better be important because you just made us lose a ranked match. The doctor spoke calmly. This is the hospital calling about your son who collapsed at work. What does that lazy piece of garbage want now? He's in critical condition from severe malnutrition. My dad exploded. Of course. I should have just let him die when he was born instead of wasting 16 years feeding him. Everyone in the room froze. Your son is hospitalized with severe exhaustion and malnutrition. The doctor said carefully. That lazy waste of space better not miss his shift tomorrow or we'll all be homeless. My mom grabbed the phone. Next, he has to give us $800 by tomorrow or I'm selling everything he owns. The doctor's voice got ice cold. Your child's organs are failing from working to support you. Stop making excuses for that pathetic failure because he can't handle it.

The finding out was biblical. I show up to practice Thursday night at the regular time and my three bandmates are sitting in a circle without their instruments like they're about to hold an intervention. Lead singer says, we need to talk about the band's future. Battle of bands is in 10 days and apparently we need to level up our image. That's when I know it's the drummer's girlfriend standing in the corner holding a bass, my bass actually, that I let him borrow last week. She's holding it upside down. Lead singer looks at me, look, you're great and all, but she has the look we need. She's been learning bass for like two months. Two months. I've been carrying this band for three years. But sure, let's get the girl who thinks a bass has six strings. They vote 3 to 1 to replace me right there with me watching like I'm getting voted off a reality show. The guitarist who still can't play an F chord cleanly actually says it's nothing personal. Nobody's looking at the bassist anyway. Might as well have someone pretty back there. Nobody's looking at the bassist. I wrote half our songs. But okay, Brad, tell me more about how music works. The drummer's girlfriend tries to be nice. You can still come to the show if you want to support us, support them. Sure. Let me buy a ticket to watch you play my bass badly. Sounds like a Dream Friday night. I don't argue, don't yell. Just say okay if that's what you all want. The lead singer seems surprised I'm not fighting back. Probably expected tears. Sorry to disappoint. They're already talking about keeping the band name and the set list for battle of bands. Acting like everything's normal. Planning tomorrow's practice like I was never even there. Like I'm already a ghost. Guitarist mentions they'll see me around and I just nod, give them a smile that doesn't reach my eyes, walk out quietly. I can hear them talking about stage positions as the door closes, how she'll look right in the back, how the judges will love having something nice to look at. They think this is over. They think I'm just going to crawl away and cry. That's cute. I'm sitting in my car in the driveway and my brain starts doing math. Tomorrow's practice. They kept saying see you at practice tomorrow to each other. But wait, that's my amp the guitarist uses because his sounds like a dying cat. My mixing board that makes our lead singer not sound like he's through a kazoo. The mic system I bought with birthday money, the cables, the stands, hell even the extension cords are mine. I check the battle of bands registration on my phone. The song list they submitted. Breaking Chains. I wrote that. Midnight Drive wrote that in my bedroom. Phoenix Rising, that's literally about my ex boyfriend. I have the notebooks. With the original lyrics in my handwriting. The van we use for gigs, mine, well, technically my mom's, but she lets me use it. And then it hits me, this is my dad's garage. Dad only lets them practice here because of me. I text him, hey, the band just kicked me out for not being pretty enough. He text back immediately, are you kidding me? They're banned. I'll change the garage code right now. My dad's the best. They kept saying, see you at practice tomorrow. They actually think they're still practicing here tomorrow in my dad's garage with my equipment, playing my songs. The delusion is actually impressive. Next day, five PM, I'm home.

I used to fake sick at least once a month. Nothing dramatic, just your classic ugh, my stomach hurts routine. I'd shuffle into the kitchen, wrap myself in a blanket, throw in a little cough and wait for my mom to sigh and say, fine, but no video games. She always fell for it or maybe she just didn't care enough to argue. This time felt no different. It was a Thursday. I had a math test I wasn't ready for and zero energy to through Mr Danner's 45 minute rant about fractions. So I pulled out the old stomachache move. My mom was already halfway out the door for work, so she just nodded and left. I grabbed a bowl of cereal, flopped onto the couch and turned on some cartoons, already feeling like I'd won. Dad works nights, so he usually sleeps through most of the day and the house stays quiet. But around 10:00, I heard his door open. I muted the TV and listened. He walked past the living room without noticing me, phone in hand, and stepped out into the garage. Didn't think much of it at first. Figured maybe he was calling in sick or trying to get a refund for something. But then I heard his voice through the wall and it wasn't his normal voice. It was quiet, tired, flat. I can't do this anymore, he said. I paused. I tried. I Really tried, but I feel like I don't even know my family anymore. I come home and everything's just cold. I tiptoed down the hall, heart suddenly racing. The garage door was cracked open, just like always, and I crouched beside it. I know this isn't what we wanted, but it's where we are now. He said, every day I feel like I'm just pretend ending, pretending to be fine, pretending to be a good husband, a good dad. My stomach twisted. This time for real. I mean, look at him, he said. He doesn't even like me. He doesn't talk to me unless he wants something. And when he does, it's just one word answers. I don't even know who he is anymore. My throat went dry. I look at him and all I can think is what happened? What did I do wrong? When did he start looking at me like I was a stranger? There was silence then. I know it's awful, but sometimes I wonder if I'd be happier alone, just starting over, somewhere quiet, somewhere nobody knows me. My chest felt like it caved in. I haven't said anything to her yet, he continued. I don't even know if I will, but I can't keep going like this. I'm exhausted. I backed away from the door before I could hear more. I stumbled into the bathroom and locked the door behind me, sat on the edge of the tub and stared at the floor. He Didn't know I was home. He didn't know I was listening. And he definitely didn't know I had just realized something I could never unhear. My dad didn't just feel lost, he felt lost because of me. I stayed in the bathroom for over an hour just trying to breathe. When I finally came out, he was back in his room. I crept into mine, got under the covers and didn't move for the rest of the day. Later that night, he knocked on my door. How's your stomach, he asked. Fine, I mumbled. Need anything? No. He stood there for a second longer, then said, okay, let me know. I said nothing.

I was waiting in line at Starbucks when this kid, maybe 13, ordered a drink so complicated the barista had to write it down. Venti iced skinny hazelnut macchiato, sugar free syrup, extra shot, light ice, no whip, with exactly 2.5 pumps vanilla. One pump caramel coffee at 140 degrees in a venti cup with extra foam below the rim. The barista made it the it took one sip and exploded. This is wrong. It's 142 degrees. I said 140! Are you stupid? His mom stood there nodding. Jaden has a very refined palate. You need to remake it. The barista apologized and started over. Meanwhile, the line grew longer. An elderly man behind me sighed. The kid heard him. Do you have a problem, old man? Maybe go to McDonald's if you can't wait for quality. His mother actually laughed. Aiden, be nice. Not everyone understands coffee like you do. The second drink came out. Kid took a sip and spat it onto the counter. Now it's too cold. And this is three pumps vanilla. Can nobody here count? The manager came over, apologizing profusely. We'll make it again, no charge. No charge! We're not paying for any of this! The mom snapped. This is harassment! While waiting for drink No. 3, the kid knocked over the tip jar accidentally. Coins scattered everywhere. He watched the barista pick them up and smirked. Maybe if You made drinks correctly, you deserve tips. A woman in line called out, that's incredibly rude. The kid's mom world around. Excuse me, don't parent my child. Someone should. The woman muttered. The kid heard and started fake crying. Mom, she's bullying me! I'm just trying to get my drink. His mother immediately pulled out her phone. I'm recording this. This. This woman is harassing my minor child! The manager panicked, offered everyone free drinks to calm things down. The kid instantly stopped crying. I want a free drink card too, for my emotional distress. They gave him one. A twenty five dollar gift card for acting like a monster. The third drink came out. He tasted it, considered, and poured it on the floor. Still wrong. You know what? I'll make it myself since everyone here is incompetent. He tried to walk behind the counter. The manager blocked him. You can't come back here. My dad owns three Starbucks franchises. Yes, I can. His mom nodded. Let him fix your mistakes. The manager, exhausted, said they'd comp the drink, but he couldn't go behind the counter. The kid grabbed a display mug and threw it against the wall. Then make it right. Ceramic shards everywhere. A baby in the corner started crying from the noise. His mother's response, now look what you made him do. He has anger issues when people don't listen. The manager called security. The mom went ballistic. You're calling security on a child? I want Every employee here fired. While she ranted, the kid walked over to the condiment bar and started opening every single milk carton, sugar packet, and napkin dispenser, dumping them on the floor. Oops! He said after each one. So clumsy today. An off duty cop in line finally stepped forward.

I raised my hand as a joke. I helped my mom watch YouTube videos when she was pregnant with my brother. Does that count? The class laughed and I smiled, proud of my quick thinking. But Mister Gonzales wasn't smiling. His face had gone completely white and his hands were shaking as he gripped the edge of his desk. Good. Come with me now. The entire classroom went silent in South Dallas when a teacher used that tone. You didn't ask questions. Everyone stay in your seats. Do not leave this room. If I'm not back in 20 minutes, have someone call 9, 1 1. He was already pulling me toward the door and that's when I noticed the dark stain on his sleeve. Wet. It looked like blood. Mr Gonzales, what's happening? Is someone hurt? I tried to pull my arm free, but his grip was iron tight. I don't think I'm qualified for whatever. You're the only one who raised their hand. He cut me off. That makes you qualified. Outside, his car was already running with the doors open. She said she had until Thursday. He kept muttering while speeding out of the school parking lot. The midwife isn't answering her phone I the door handle, calculating if I could jump out at the next red light. Mr Gonzales, you're scaring me. Should I call my mom? No. He swerved around. A car and I slammed into the window. No one can know. Put your phone away. Turn it off. I'm not turning off my phone, I shouted. But I did anyway. We were going 50 in a 25 zone and Mr Gonzales kept checking his mirrors like someone was following us. Finally, he pulled into a driveway of a small yellow house that definitely wasn't his. Listen to me. He grabbed my shoulders before we got out. They can't know she was here. Do you understand? No matter what happens, they can't know. I don't understand anything. I was practically yelling, now I'm 17. I don't even have my license yet. Marco. He used my name for the first time, his voice desperate. You've kept bigger secrets than this. I know your family. I need that same silence now. He wasn't wrong. I'd already seen two drive bys this year and never said a word to the cops. But this felt different. He shoved a pair of surgical gloves into my hands. Put these on. The front door was unlocked. Inside, we followed the sound of crying to a back bedroom where a woman was curled up on a bare mattress. She looked young, maybe early 20s, with long black hair stuck to her face with sweat. It's too early, she gasped in accented English when she saw us. Then she looked at me and started crying harder. He's just a child. You brought a child. I'm 17, I said. Stupid like that made any difference? I watch Grey's anatomy, if that helps. She switched to Spanish and started begging Mister Gonzales for something I couldn't understand. He pushed me toward her. Check how dilated she is. What? I backed up so fast I knocked over.

Like I think men and women can be friends. So, you know. Well, I don't, I don't think there's any possibility of men and women ever being friends, ever. You do not believe that. The bottom line, you just feel like you guys are better off being friends and that's it. Yeah, she's very cute. You know, she's just not quite my type, I would say. Okay. So what's your type then? Uh, I mean, my friends always make fun of me for it. So, um, you know. Make fun of you for it. Yeah. Why they make fun of your type of person you like to date? You know, everybody has their type and I just have A different type than a lot of people. I'm dying to know. Is it an eye patch thing? Oh, God, I love people with eye patches. It's always been my thing. Tell me it's eye patches. Uh, no, not quite. I don't have a thing for pirates. I promise you we won't make fun of you if you tell us what your type is. I can trust you. No, of course you can't. But you should tell us anyway. Yeah. Is it like a physical thing or a personality thing? No, it's, it's physical. Okay. So what is it? Uh, okay. Here's the thing about Kara.

My daughter's fourth grade teacher told her class that blood is blue inside your body and only turns red when it hits oxygen. Lily came home repeating this fact while showing me her veins. I gently explained, that's actually not true. Blood is always red because of hemoglobin. Just it's darker red in veins. She looked at me confused, but Missus Wilson showed us a whole Powerpoint about it. Dad. She even had diagrams from a science book. Next morning, I packed my work scrubs in my bag. I'm an ER nurse at Mercy General and I was working the 3 p m. Shift. Anyway, I sent Missus Wilson an email asking if I could do a quick 15 minute presentation about blood for Career Day that afternoon. She loved the idea.

Missus Wilson smile started fading as I explained When we draw blood with these, it never touches oxygen until we pop the cap off. But I showed photos on my phone of sealed blood tubes, still red. The kids were fascinated. I showed them medical textbook pages on my tablet. Missus Wilson kept clearing her throat, her face getting redder than the blood samples on my screen. But our textbook says it's blue, one boy argued, pointing to their science book. I walked over and checked the publication date. 1998. Medicine updates pretty fast, I explained. We used to think lots of things that turned out to be wrong. Missus Wilson suddenly stood up. Well, thank you for that interesting presentation, Mister. Johnson, but we need to move on to math now.

The current curriculum specifically mentions this myth as something to correct. I showed her the screen. That's when she asked me to step into the hallway. The kids watched wide eyed as the door closed behind us. Do you have any idea how hard it is to teach these kids when parents undermine my authority? She pissed. Now they'll question everything I say. I kept my voice calm. Isn't that exactly what we want them to do, question things and learn critical thinking? I've been teaching for 22 years, she snapped. I'm not changing my whole curriculum because some nurse thinks he knows better than our textbooks. That night, Lily asked me if she was in trouble because Missus Wilson kept giving her mean looks all afternoon. I assured her she wasn't. The next day, Missus Wilson announced a pop quiz with questions like, what color is blood inside the body? Lily answered red and got marked wrong. She came home crying with a big red F. I requested a meeting with the principal and brought printouts of medical textbooks, state science standards and Lily's Quiz. Principal Davis listened carefully, then called in Missus Wilson. When confronted with the evidence, Missus Wilson insisted, this is how I've always taught it, Principal Davis asked, but is it correct? After a long pause, Missus Wilson said, it's what the children understand better. I lost it. My daughter is crying. Every morning before school because she's afraid of getting F's for writing down the truth. Two weeks later, the school replaced their 1998 science books. Missus Wilson was required to attend professional development on current scientific standards. On Lily's next report card, Missus Wilson wrote excellent critical thinking skills. But at the parent teacher conference, she wouldn't look me in the eye. And when I signed up to help with the science fair, I noticed my name had been crossed off the volunteer list. Lily still checks with me whenever she learns something new at school. Dad, is this actually true or is it just a missus Wilson truth?

Someone was forcing her to send these messages, and she was using our childhood code to tell me she'd been kidnapped. I kept replying, trying to subtly tell her that I understood what she was saying without tipping off anyone else reading her texts, but I wasn't sure it was working. The final text came at 2:00am and made my heart stop. I'm having such a peaceful time here. I said hi to 47 people, and it reminded me of how we used to play pirates. My mom would love the cookies they serve. The purple flowers here are so beautiful. And I spend all day at the library reading. This is exactly what I needed. Every single code word was in that message. Danger. Help me. And she'd given me a location. High to 47. Highway 47. And we used to play pirates at Whitman Creek. I didn't call the police because I knew they'd think I was crazy talking about a secret code. Instead, I grabbed my dad's hunting rifle and drove two hours to Whitman Creek. I parked down the road and crept through the woods until I found a rundown cabin. There was Calla tied to a chair in the living room, with a man I'd never seen before pacing around her. I called 9 1 1 from the woods and told them there was an armed kidnapper at the cabin. The police surrounded the place 20 minutes later, and Took Calla back and captured the kidnapper. Calla was shaking like she used to during thunderstorms when we were kids, but she was alive. The kidnapper was some creep named Jack who'd been stalking Calla for months. He grabbed her from her apartment parking garage and forced her to send those messages to keep people from searching. What he didn't know was that Calla had been leaving me a bread crumb trail the entire time. During the arrest, Jack kept ranting. How was I supposed to know she was talking in some kind of secret language? Where do girls come up with this crap? Callus spent three days in the hospital. She's going to be okay. When I visited her, the first thing she said was, I can't believe you remembered our stupid spy code. I told her it wasn't stupid. It saved her life. She laughed and said, well, I guess all those years of pretending to be secret agents finally paid off. We don't use the code for silly things anymore. But we did both teach it to our daughters. Because you never know when you might need to scream for help in the quietest way possible.

I feel bad lying to my parents, he said, but they'd never understand. Dad would probably just lecture me about wasting time on games. That hit hard. Here was my son building something impressive. Afraid I wouldn't understand. So I devised a plan. I created an anonymous account and became his biggest supporter, always first to comment on videos. I'd leave detailed feedback just like I wished I could do in person. He started mentioning this mysterious viewer in his videos, grateful for their support. Then came his biggest video yet, hitting 1 million subscribers. He went live to celebrate and that's when I dropped the bomb. I donated $500 with the message, Congratulations, son. Next time you need better lighting for studying, just ask love dad. The stream went silent. He just stared at the screen, mouth open. Then in front of a million subscribers, my quiet, reserved son broke down crying. Dad's been watching this whole time, he whispered. I I heard him run upstairs to my office. When he burst in still crying, I spun around in my chair wearing his merchandise, a T-shirt with his channel logo I'd secretly ordered weeks ago. We should probably talk about that 300 dollar microphone now, I said. Grinning, he launched Himself at me for a hug, then froze. Wait, all those noise interruptions, the soundproofing suggestions, that was all you? Of course I laughed. You think I couldn't hear you raging about dying to millenia at 3 a. M. I raised you. I know what gamer rage sounds like. Now he streams from a proper setup in his room. No more sneaking around. Last week, he hit 2 million subscribers. That 300 dollar microphone receipt that started it all, I had it framed. It hangs above his setup, signed by both of us. Best investment ever.

My 14 year old son thinks he's a master of deception, but he has no idea I know about his secret YouTube channel. I discovered it by accident when I was cleaning his room and found a crumpled receipt for a 300 dollar microphone. At first I was furious. We just had a talk about responsible spending. But before confronting him, I decided to do some digging. That night after he went to bed, I searched his browser history. There it was, a gaming channel with 50,000 subscribers. My quiet, introverted son, who barely i spoke at family dinners was absolutely electric on camera, cracking jokes and entertaining thousands. Instead of shutting it down, i decided to play dumb and secretly support him. Every time he went to study at the library, i knew he was actually recording videos in our basement. I'd intentionally make extra noise upstairs so he'd have to re-record, teaching him patience. He complained about background noise ruining his takes. I suggested soundproofing his room for better concentration while studying. He started asking for odd things, green poster board, ring lights, a better webcam. Each time I'd make him present a detailed plan for how these school supplies would improve his grades. His presentations got increasingly elaborate. He even made a Powerpoint about how better lighting would help him read text books more clearly. The best part, every time he uploaded a new video, I'd watch It immediately, my son would sit at dinner casually mentioning how hard his homework was while I knew he just spent three hours trying to beat the final boss in Elden Ring. He got creative with his excuses. Once he told us he needed to join the debate club to improve his public speaking. In reality, he was practicing his commentary skills. When he won most improved speaker at school, I had to bite my tongue. His hundreds of hours of gaming commentary had given him more confidence than any debate club could. One day he mentioned needing a new chair because his back hurt from studying. I knew the real reason.

My best friend Calla and I created a secret code when we were 8 years old because we thought we were super spies. We'd replace certain words with seemingly innocent phrases that meant something completely different. Purple flowers meant danger. Going to the library meant help me. My mom made cookies meant I'm scared. We used it throughout middle school and high school, mostly for stupid stuff like getting out of awkward date or signalling when we needed backup at parties. By college, we pretty much forgotten about it, but old habits die hard and sometimes we'd still slip coded phrases into our conversations without thinking about it. When Callah's text started coming in one day, everything seemed normal at first. Hey, Amanda, I've been thinking a lot lately and I've decided to take some time for myself. I'm leaving town for a while and I don't want anyone to worry about me or try to find me. I just need space to figure things out. Tell my parents I'm safe, but I won't be in contact for a while. It sounded like Calla, but something felt off. She'd been planning her sister's wedding for months and would never just disappear without a word. Plus, Calla never used the phrase figure things out because she said it was basic white girl speak. The text kept coming over the next few days, each one more persistent. I know you're probably confused, but this Is what I need right now. Please don't let anyone look for me. I'm exploring new opportunities and meeting new people. Some days I feel like I'm in a completely different world. That's when my blood ran cold. Different world was part of our old code. It meant not safe. I read the message again and suddenly other phrases jumped out at me. New opportunities was code for trap. Meeting new people meant stranger danger. I started analyzing every text she'd sent. Staying at this really cute place with purple flowers everywhere appeared. In the third message, purple flowers meant danger. I've been spending a lot of time at the library. Here was in the fifth message. Library meant help me. My hands were shaking as.

After giving up, I returned to my room and looked through our old drawing book we worked on together, reminding myself of why I loved my brother so much growing up. To my surprise, two of the pages in the book had tiny folded notes addressed to me saying terrible things about my dad. Each note explained gruesome details about how my dad hit my brother or punished him through starvation or tied him up outside to a tree. I covered my mouth from shock and frantically searched around my room for more clues from our old toys. The last note I found asked me to call the police he thought that my dad was going to do something unspeakable to him soon. My, my heart raced just thinking about what had actually happened to my brother. I brought all of the notes I found to class the following day and stopped by the police station in my free time. I begged them to reopen my brother's case and submitted all the evidence as well as my personal testimony. I asked them to bring in my brother's old friends who we're also aware of the things that have been going on between my brother and my father. With enough statements, the police escorted me home and arrested my father. The moment he got home at this station, it was revealed that my dad had Really beaten my brother and hid him in the tree. The week he went missing, my father made sure to remove all notes from my brother's room, but never bothered checking mine. Hearing his confession at the station made me sick to my stomach. I couldn't believe I was living with a man who could hurt a family member in the most horrific ways imaginable. I. I moved out of the house that same day and moved into my mom's house. This year, my dad has a chance for Parole, but I plan on fighting it for both me and my older brother.

I was always told that my older brother ran away with his friends, but it never really made sense because I still saw his friends around town. I remember the first time I heard about him running away. It was around 1987 and I was about 8 years old. My father told me over dinner that my brother had left home while I was away at school that day, told me not to look for him. I felt really sad because I really loved watching television with him and riding our bikes together. And for him to leave without saying goodbye, it really hurt my heart. While I rolled around the peas with my fork, I asked my dad when my brother would be coming back. My Dad's expression turned grim as he told me that my brother would most likely never return. That broke my heart even more. The following day, I saw my dad cutting down my brother's favorite tree in the backyard. I tried to run out and stop him, but my dad told me that he needed to remove the tree so that he could send it to my brother. That was another thing that never made sense to me, but I accepted it as a kid. Days turned into weeks and weeks into years. It had been 10 years since my older brother ran away. I was ready to Finally accept the fact that I would never see him again until I saw his best friend enter the grocery store I worked at and saw my chance at closure. I approached him casually and asked if my brother lived with him or contacted him. The friend gave a weirded out look and explained that none of my friends had seen him for over a decade. I asked if they knew where my brother had run off to and they said that he never ran off anywhere. I tried to push for more information, but my father walked into the store looking for me. I apologized to the friend and walked off to help my dad out. Later that.

But she sounded weird. Really weird. Tip, honey, where are you right now? Her voice was shaky, like she'd been crying. I'm on the bus. We're running late because she cut me off. Listen to me very carefully. Do not come home today. Go to Aunt Pip's house instead. I'll pick you up there later. In the background, I could hear men's voices talking, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. Mom, what's wrong? Why can't I come home? The line went quiet for a few seconds. Then she whispered, just trust me, baby. Don't come to the house. Paul ended abruptly, leaving me staring at my phone in panic. Mr. Bax was watching me in the rearview mirror. What did she say? I told him about going to my aunt's house instead, and his face got this grim expression. The black car was still following us, and now there was a second one behind it. Change of plans, kid. We're going straight to the police station. He made a sharp turn away from both my house and my aunt's neighborhood. Several kids protested, but Mister FAX wasn't taking any arguments. Everyone stay in your seats and keep quiet. This is a safety issue. I tried calling my mom back, but now her phone was going directly to a recording saying the number was disconnected. That. That's when I knew something was really, really wrong. At the police station, Mister Bax, Wouldn't let me get off the bus until two officers came out to escort me. They asked me a bunch of questions about my parents and if I knew why someone might be following me. I didn't have any answers. One officer made some phone calls while the other one stayed with me. After about an hour, they told me that my parents were safe, but couldn't explain anything else. They said my mom had contacted them about a family situation and asked them to keep me somewhere secure. I spent that night at the police station's family services office, sleeping on a couch and wondering if I'd ever see my parents again. Three days later, I found out the truth. My dad had been working undercover for the DEA for months and investigating a drug trafficking ring. Someone had figured out his real identity and threatened our family. The men following the bus were part of the criminal organization trying to grab me as leverage against my dad. My mom's strange phone call happened because those same men were in our house for trying to lure me home. Mr. Bax had spotted them following his route and realized something was wrong. If I had gotten off at my stop that day, I would have walked right into a kidnapping situation. We had to move to a different state, and I never saw Mr. Bax again. But he literally saved my life just by paying attention.

Call your mom right now. I looked up, confused because Mister Bax never talked to individual kids unless someone was throwing things or starting fights. He'd been driving Route 47 for like 10 years and barely acknowledged any of us existed. Why? I pulled out my earbuds and walked closer to the front. His knuckles were white from gripping the steering wheel so hard. Just call her right now. His voice had this urgent edge that made my stomach flip. Fumbled for my phone while other kids started complaining about why we weren't moving. We were stopped three blocks before my usual stop on Cedar Lane. Just sitting there with the engine idling. My mom's phone went straight to voicemail. I tried again. Same thing. She's not answering. Mister Bax was staring at something in his side mirror. And when I turned to look, I saw a black sedan that had been following us for the last few turns. Try your dad or anyone else in your family now. I was really freaking out because, but drivers don't care about your family unless something is seriously wrong. I called my dad and got voicemail again. The black car was still there, just sitting behind us with its engine running. Through the tinted windows, I could see the outline of someone in the driver's seat. Mr Bax, what's going on? My voice Came out higher than I meant it to. He reached for his radio and spoke quietly into it. Base, this is bus 47. I need immediate assistance at Cedar and fifth. Possible situation with suspicious vehicle following my route. The dispatcher's voice crackled back, asking for details, but Mr Bax kept his responses vague. The other kids on the bus were getting restless and starting to ask questions. Jace from the back yelled, yo, why aren't we moving? I got practice. Mr Bax ignored him and kept watching that black car in his mirror. Kip, I need you to listen very carefully when I tell you. I want you to duck down below the window level and stay there until I say it's safe. My heart started pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. Are we in danger? I whispered. But before, before he could answer, the black sedan pulled up alongside our bus. The windows were so dark I couldn't see inside, but I felt like someone was staring right at me. Mister Bax's hand moved to something under his dashboard that looked like a panic button. Everyone sit down and be quiet, he announced to the whole bus in his serious voice. The car kept pace with us as we started moving again. Staying right next to my window, I pressed myself against the seat back, trying to make myself smaller. Other kids were craning their necks to see what was happening, but something about The whole situation felt wrong in a way I couldn't explain. My phone finally.

Now, 15 years later, my brother's kids are jealous of my nephew and want me to treat them equally. Back when I was 24, I got hit with the worst betrayal imaginable. My wife Helen was sleeping with my brother Jason, the kid I've been raising for almost three years. Changing diapers, getting up at 3 a m. For feedings, teaching him to walk. His, not mine. I found out when my mom mentioned how much the baby looked like Jason did as a toddler. She said it as a joke, but something clicked. I got a paternity test behind Helen's back. The results came. I just sat in my car in the parking lot and cried for two hours. I divorced her and made sure she got absolutely drained in the process. Then her and Jason got married six months later, like some twisted fairy tale. I told Jason to his face that he was dead to me. Any kids he brought into this world would never be my family. My parents tried to make me forgive him. I moved three hours away instead. Fast forward 15 years. Jason's got four kids now, including the one I thought was mine. I don't interact with them at family gatherings. I'm civil, say hi if I have to, but that's it. Meanwhile, I'm super close with my youngest sister Anna's three kids. I take them to amusement parks, buy them gifts for no reason, show up to every single school play and soccer game. I genuinely love spending time with them and they light up when they see me. I never got married again. Got close once, but I just couldn't do it. I'm in a long term relationship now with someone who understands my damage. I've got a great job in tech that pays well, so I've got plenty of money to spoil my nieces and nephews. Anna's kids, I mean, not Jason's. Last month I bought Tyler, Anna's oldest who just turned 14, a brand new gaming setup. We're talking top tier monitor, custom built PC, mechanical keyboard, the works. The kids obsessed with gaming and his old computer was like 7 years old, barely running anything. Two days ago I went to pick him up from Anna's house for our monthly uncle Nephew day. When I got there, Jason's whole family was visiting. All four of his kids were in the living room with Anna's kid.

I nearly choked on my wine. Are you serious right now? On our anniversary? It's just physical attraction. We're both adults. You could pick someone, too. Anyone you want. It would be fair.

Lululemon stuff that cost more than my car payment. Coming home glowing and energized in ways I hadn't seen in years. Always talking about. Luke says this, and Luke thinks that anyone I asked into my steak. Anyone. I trust you completely. We're secure enough for this. Okay, then I choose Amy. Her fork clattered onto the plate. Saw spattering everywhere. Amy? My Amy? Your sister Amy? Yes. You said anyone, right? No restrictions. Lisa's face went white, then red, then white again. See, Amy was her older sister. The one who'd always been the pretty one, the successful one. The one who got married first, had kids first, bought the Bigger house in the better neighborhood. First Lisa had spent actual years in therapy, working through those insecurities, crying about how she'd never measure up. That's not what I meant, and you know it. How was it different? You want meaningless physical stuff with some guy who probably has ABS tattooed on his ABS? Amy and I have actual history. Emotional connection. Which we did. I dated Amy briefly in college before she introduced me to Lisa at a house party. Ancient history. But it had always been this weird thing between the sisters. Amy would make little comments at family dinners. Remember when we used to go to that place? Lisa would get this look. You're being ridiculous. That was college. Am I? Amy's been texting me about planning your mom's surprise birthday party. We've been talking every day for two weeks. There's definitely unresolved tension there. I was completely making this up. Amy had texted me once asking what cake flavor your mom liked. But Lisa didn't need to know that detail.

Lisa waved him away, frantically staring at my phone like it contained nuclear codes. This is different. And you know it. How? Because it's your family. Because it would actually hurt you in a way that matters. Interesting how that works out. She was quiet for a long time, twisting her wedding ring, the diamonds catching the candlelight. Finally, I never wanted to hurt you. I just thought I don't know what. I thought. You thought I'd be cool with you getting railed by some guy named Luke, but you can't handle me.

She even threw in protective hand gestures over her belly whenever the lawyer mentioned my name. My lawyer stayed quiet, letting them dig their own grave. When it was his turn, he simply stood up and said, your honor, before we address any financial claims, I believe we need to clarify something important. That's when he pulled out the court records. Restraining order application, the sworn statements, the police reports, everything Natalie had filed claiming I was a dangerous monster. The judge reviewed the documents, her expression growing serious. Then she looked up at Natalie and asked the question that ended everything. Miss Brooks, according to these records, you filed a restraining order six months ago. You stated under oath that he was violent and dangerous. The order prohibited any contact. You're now eight months pregnant. When exactly did this conception occur? The silence was deafening. Could literally hear Natalie's brain trying to do the math and failing spectacularly. Her lawyer went pale. Natalie started stammering about complicated timing and reconciliation periods. But math doesn't lie. She was eight months pregnant. The restraining order was six months old. Either she'd perjured herself about me being dangerous, or she was lying about the baby being mine. The judge pulled up more records. Security footage from my apartment, showing I've been home every night. My work attendance, even credit card statements, proving I've never been near Natalie. Miss Brooks, the judge said coldly, You've ended contradictory sworn statements. Either you lied about needing Protection, or you're lying about paternity. Both are serious crimes. Natalie tried backtracking, claiming brief reconciliations that weren't documented. But my lawyer presented phone records showing no communication, building key card logs proving I'd never left during her claimed meeting times, even traffic cameras showing my car had never been near her house. The judge didn't just Miss Natalie's claims. She referred her to the DA for perjury charges. Two separate counts. Sometimes the best revenge is letting liars hang themselves.

She thought it would secure her a payout until the judge asked one question. You ever see someone's face when their own lie destroys them? Because I got a front row seat to that exact moment. Natalie walked into that courtroom eight months pregnant, glowing with confidence. She'd been stalling our divorce for a year with every trick in the book, fake emergencies, missing paperwork, sudden mental health crisis that required postpone opponents. But this, this was her grand finale. The plan was obvious. Walk in looking vulnerable, play the abandoned pregnant wife card and watch the judge throw out our iron clad prenup out of pure sympathy. She'd done her research, too, picked a female judge thinking the sisterhood would work in her favor. What Natalie didn't realize was that her own paranoia had already destroyed avoid her. Six months earlier during one of our screaming matches, she'd called the cops claiming I'd threatened her. Complete lie. But she ran with it, filed a restraining order. The next day, stood in front of a judge with crocodile tears claiming I was violent and dangerous, said she feared for her life and needed protect action. The judge bought it, granted the order immediately. I couldn't come within 500 feet of her, couldn't contact her, couldn't even drive down our old street. My lawyer advised me not to fight it, just let the divorce proceed and move on. So I did. Exactly. That followed that restraining order to the letter. Didn't call, didn't text, didn't even look in her direction when I saw her at the grocery store. I had witnesses, security footage, phone records, everything proving I'd stayed away. But here's the thing about restraining orders that Natalie forgot. They create a paper for trail. Every violation gets documented. Every interaction gets recorded. The court system tracks everything. Fast forward to Today. Natalie strutted in wearing a designer maternity dress, one hand on her belly, the other clutching tissues for the Waterworks. It even brought her mother. For extra sympathy points, her lawyer started the sob story, immediately painted me as the classic deadbeat dad who'd abandoned his pregnant wife, talked about her financial hardship and how she'd been left with nothing while carrying our child. Natalie sat there nodding.

Look at those hardwood floors, she'd sigh. I die for a kitchen like that. Asking price was 285 k. I offered 300 k cash, no inspection, close in two weeks. The seller couldn't say yes fast enough. I kept it quiet. But the realtor posted on Facebook, congratulations to our mystery cash buyer on 42 Maple street. Within an hour, my phone was buzzing non stop. Listen. Omg, who bought it? I'm dying to know. Catherine saw someone bought your dream house. Crazy coincidence. I ignored them all. Moving day was perfect. Hired the best company, made sure the whole neighborhood could see the fancy trucks. That weekend, I threw a housewarming party, invited everyone except my family. Of course, they showed up anyway. Madison walked in first looking around in amazement. Then Catherine with her kids. Finally, my parents carrying wine like they were invited guests. This place is incredible, Madison breathed, running her hands over the kitchen island. How did you afford it? She stopped when she saw me. Hello, Madison, I said calmly. Catherine recovered. First we heard about the party. This house is amazing. Oil rigs, I said simply. Turns out when you're not supporting a cheating wife, you can save quite a bit. Madison stepped forward, tears in her eyes. I made mistakes, but this was our dream house. You're right, I nodded. Right before you told me I'd never afford it, right before you found someone who could. Security. I called to my friend Kai. Please escort these people out. We're family, Catherine. Protect. Family doesn't choose cheating wives over their own blood, I replied. As they were walked to the door, Madison turned back one last time. Don't you think you're being vindictive? I looked around at my beautiful home, the hardwood floors, the granite counters she dreamed about for years. This is just me living my best life without any of you in it. The door closed with a satisfying click. They've been calling ever since. Addison's evicted and wants to work things out. Catherine needs a place to stay. My parents think I'm cruel, but I'm done. Some bridges aren't worth rebuilding. Besides, I love the look on their faces when they realized the failure they'd written off was living in their dream home. Best 300 k I ever spent, worth every penny.

Now my sister, ex wife and parents are furious. I refuse to let them back in. Three years ago, I was married to Madison, who thought my 65 k mechanic salary made me a failure. She'd constantly show me houses online, not to motivate me, but to remind me how inadequate I was. Look at this kitchen, she'd say, shoving her phone in my face. Samantha's husband bought her granite countertops, but I guess I'll never have nice things. I worked overtime, picked up weekend jobs, even sold my motorcycle to save for a down payment. Nothing was ever enough. The final straw came when I surprised her with a vacation I've been saving for. She spent the whole trip texting Evan from yoga class. When we got home, I found them together in our bed, not even ashamed. You're never here anyway, Madison said. Evan actually pays attention to me. The divorce was ugly. She tried to take everything, claiming she sacrificed her career for our marriage. What career? She worked part time at a boutique. But the real knife came from my sister Catherine. We've been close our whole lives. I helped raise her kids, fixed her car for free, loaned her money when her husband was unemployed. Madison told me everything Catherine said, how you never bought her anything nice. Maybe if you'd been a better husband, she wouldn't have needed to find happiness elsewhere. My own sister. Was blaming me for being cheated on. My parents were no better. Marriage is work, mom said. Maybe you both made mistakes. That's when I realized I was completely alone. I liquidated everything and took a job on an oil rig in North Dakota. 18 months of hell, 14 hour shifts in freezing weather, living in a tiny trailer with 3 other guys who never showered. But the money was incredible. Hundred and 20 k a year, almost no expense. I saved every penny, lived on ramen and protein bars. When I came back, I had nearly 200 k o cash and perfect credit from paying off all my debts. I started house hunting and saw it, 42 Maple street, Madison's dream house. She'd shown me this exact house does.

Then at Thanksgiving dinner, he found out I had $30 million and had a complete meltdown in front of everyone. My aunt screamed and my dad. Just growing up, Nathan was the golden boy. New car at 16, vacations to Europe, private schools that cost more than a mortgage. Me, I was the boring cousin, the quiet one, the one working after school just to buy a beat up Honda. At family dinners, Nathan bragged while the adults nodded proudly and my aunt clinked her glass like her son and with some kind of prodigy. Meanwhile, when I got a B+ instead of an a, my parents said I wasn't applying myself. That's how it was. Nathan could fail a class and it was just a phase. But while they were laughing at me, I was grinding. I landed an internship at a finance firm, Learned everything, started investing, built a business. By the time I was out of college, I was sitting on something huge. I just didn't tell anyone. Why brag to people who already wrote you off? Fast forward to Thanksgiving this year, Nathan's at the head of the table bragging about some networking trip his parents paid for. Everyone's listening like he's the next Elon Musk. Then my aunt turns to me with her fake sweet voice and goes, Andy, you're still doing paperwork somewhere, right? The whole table chuckles. Nathan smirks something In me snapped. I set my glass down and said, yeah, paper is worth about 30 million. The room went dead silent. My aunt's hand froze halfway to her wine. My dad just stared like he didn't hear me right. Nathan's girlfriend literally pulled her arm off his shoulder. And Nathan, he laughed nervously. Yeah, right. Stop exaggerating. But I wasn't. That's when it flipped. Suddenly, they cared. My aunt leaned in, voice sharp. If that's true, Andy, family helps family. Nathan's been working so hard, you should give him a boost. Nathan perked up immediately. Yeah, bro, you don't even need all that. Help me out. I sat there swirling my drink, realizing they weren't proud of me. They didn't see me as family. They saw me as a bank account. After dinner, my phone blew up, my aunt texting me.

The caption said, the only one who deserves celebrating. I commented, nice cake. My mom replied, at least someone's worth baking for. I smiled, replied, enjoy it while you can. That same night, I made one transfer, sent two emails. 12 days later, my sister screamed when her landlord called and said your rents canceled. I was sitting at my desk eating leftovers when the notification came through a Facebook tag. I opened it expecting maybe a few birthday messages. Instead, 20 photos of an expensive backyard party, white tents, navy linens, catering trays, a neon sign that said Amanda Con 2025. And in the center, a custom cake with gold cursive to our star Amanda. The caption posted by my mom, the only one who deserves celebrating. Every photo showed smiling faces, my parents, Amanda holding champagne, Uncle Rick and Aunt Laura. Not a single mention of my birthday, which was that exact day. I commented, nice cake. My mom replied within two minutes, at least someone's worth baking for. Then I remembered the text from dad two weeks earlier. Hey, we need a little help, something special. Can you send $500? I didn't ask questions, just transferred it. Now I knew where it went. Shrimp platters, monogram napkins, that gold icing, the same Amanda who the night before had been drunk in our family group chat. Imagine being 28. And still figuring life out. At least one of us isn't a total disappointment. Then dropped a gift of someone slow clapping. Nobody said a word that night. After Jess fell asleep, I sat at my laptop, opened the banking app, the joint family account, the one from last year when dad got his hours cut. And mom said it would help us as the team, except the team was just me. Every paycheck I'd throw in a few hundred. They'd contribute maybe $15. Every other month, I transferred everything out clean, not a cent left. Then I sent two emails. First one to Amanda's landlord. I co signed her lease last year. When she couldn't figure out the paperwork. I'm withdrawing.

His breathing was so shallow, I had to put a mask on him. His heart rate stayed at 20. It was like his whole system had been put on pause. When I knew. Lidocaine. Medical grade lidocaine. Enough of it injected directly could slow your heart to almost nothing, make you look dead. But where the hell did an inmate in solitary get lidocaine? Had them bag him up, and we rushed him to the medical wing. I wasn't letting them transport him to the morgue. Not yet. We got him on monitors, and I pumped him with IV fluids and epinephrine. Thirty minutes later, his heart rate started climbing. 40, 60, 80. Then his eyes opened. He looked around, confused at first. Then he saw me, and a huge grin spread across his face. It worked. He whispered. Holy shit. It actually worked. I wanted to strangle him. You almost died, you idiot. Now! I knew what I was doing. Just needed to get out of that box. I couldn't breathe in there, DOC. I couldn't. His voice cracked. I just needed out. Turns out Curtis had been planning this for two days. He paid another inmate named Felix three hundred bucks. Money his mom had put in his Commissary account steal a vial of lidocaine from the medical supply room. Felix worked laundry detail and had figured out how to pick the lock on the supply closet. Curtis injected himself with enough to drop his vitals to almost nothing. He'd read about it in some medical book in the prison library. Thought if they declared him dead, they'd take him to the hospital or at least move him to medical, where the rooms had windows. The craziest part, he timed it. Knew the guard shift change was at 7:45.

Like five months later, my husband asks where my card is because he can't find his. I'm like, you have yours, where's mine? And he goes, oh, I let My sister borrow it a while back. Just stared at him. This man really handed over my card after we literally just got his back from them. But whatever. I wasn't gonna make it a huge thing.

See? Mommy helps them sleep forever. Last night she was on the phone telling someone their dad wasn't suffering anymore. I checked our bank account on my phone and saw deposits I'd never noticed. Small cash amounts, twice weekly for months. Small enough that I wouldn't notice if I wasn't looking for them. Heidi, you said Mommy helped grandma, too. She nodded eagerly. Grandma was screaming from the hurt. Then Mommy gave her medicine from this bag, and she got quiet and peaceful. Mommy said it was a blessing. The garage door rumbled open. Brooks car pulled in. She walked into the kitchen to find me sitting at the table with the medical bag open in front of me. Her face went white. Ethan, I can explain. Heidi ran to hug her. Mommy, daddy found your helping medicine. Brooks eyes filled with tears. Heidi, go watch TV, please. After Heidi left, I stood up, my voice shaking. What the hell is this, Brooke? Are you stealing from the hospital? Are you selling them? She sat down slowly. Ethan, no. Tell me right now. These are controlled substances. This is morphine in our home. What are you doing with them? Brooke looked at me steadily. You're not going to let this go unless I explain everything, are you? Damn right I'm not. She took a breath. I'm giving terminal patients enough medication to end their lives peacefully. I steal these substances from the hospital and I give them To families whose loved ones are dying in agony. They take them home, administer them, and their family members die without pain. That's what I've been doing. I stared at her in shock. So you're kill when people. No. I'm ending their suffering when they're already dying. Brooke, this is. You could go to prison for the rest of your life. They could give you the death penalty. I'm giving these people the peaceful death they deserve. Brooke's voice rose. My mother begged me to end her. Ethan begged me, and I did it. I gave her enough morphine to stop her heart while she slept. You're insane, I said, backing away from her. You've lost your mind.

She wrote, Mommy helps sick people sleep forever at the hospital. I was making Heidi's lunch when I found her homework worksheet crumpled in her backpack. The assignment had asked students to describe their parents jobs. In her messy second grade handwriting, Heidi had written word for word, my mommy helps sick people sleep forever at the hospital. I think the hospital doesn't know about it. I stared at the paper and how to chill up my spine because this sounded bad. But kids say the weirdest things, right? My wife, Brooke, deals with terminal patients everyday, helping families through their darkest moments. Heidi probably overheard Brooke talking about end of life care and got confused. But then Tuesday afternoon, my phone rang. Mr. Hale, this is Mrs. Alvarez, Heidi's teacher. We need to discuss Heidi's homework assignment about her mother's job. My stomach tightened. Is something wrong? I asked, and what I heard next sent me into shock. Heidi gave a presentation today. She told the class her mother brings medicine home from the hospital to help people sleep forever. She mentioned that families pay your wife privately for this service. She even said, your wife keeps a special bag hidden in your garage. I gripped the phone harder. Kids misunderstand things, Mr. Hale. Heidi described specific medications by name. Morphine, fentanyl. She even said her grandmother needed the special medicine before she went to heaven. The other parents are Concerned, I left work immediately, my mind spinning. How could Heidi even know those names? And what was this about Brooke bringing medicine home? When I got home, Heidi was coloring at the kitchen table. I sat beside her, keeping my voice gentle. Heidi, Honey, tell me about what you wrote about Mommy's job. She looked up with innocent eyes. I wrote what I see, daddy. Mommy helps people who are hurting really bad. That's right. She

Then she pulled out a little candy bar with peanuts and almost handed it over to my son before I slapped it out of her hand. I stood up and glared at her. That's it! You're never going to see your grandson until you figure out how to actually be nice and respect my family's boundaries, I said sternly, taking my son to his room to make sure he's fine. My husband went up after a couple of minutes with an angry expression. You shouldn't have done that to her. Now she's downstairs crying when all she wanted to do was help. Help? You're kidding, right? She tried harming our child. Your son! I shouted back. He shook his head at me and walked back out to continue having dinner with his family. After that, I stopped inviting his family over, declined every time she offered to babysit. My husband was still angry at me, saying I was being unfair and holding a grudge over nothing. But I didn't care. My son's health was my priority. But last week I had to leave town when my mom suddenly collapsed. My husband promised he'd stay home with our son, so before I left, I showed him exactly where to find the Epipen and reminded him about all our Rules. Absolutely no peanuts. Okay, I got it. Go and focus on your mom, he said just before I had to rush out. But apparently, after an hour of watching our kid, my husband needed to urgently step out to visit some friends and watch an important game. He dropped off our child to his mom, handed over the Epipen, and told her all the rules that she called useless just weeks ago, expecting her to follow it. She rolled her eyes and said, fine, fine. And he thought that was the end of it. But he was wrong. After he left, she decided to prove once and for all that I've been lying about the allergy. She gave my son peanut butter cookies, thinking she could finally show everyone I was being overdramatic. But then she watched his face swell up and panicked as he started turning purple and blue right in front of her. She called my husband, crying for help while she struggled with the Epipen. He quickly called 9 1 1 and raced back to see the damage. My husband called me an hour later at the hospital. Our son. He had an attack. I drove like a maniac to get there just in time to hear his mother confess that she'd given him peanut butter to see if the allergy was real. But she wasn't even sorry. If you hadn't cuddled him so much, maybe his immune system would be stronger. Even the staff couldn't Believe it. That's when I decided that my mother in law needed to be unalived.

But mom had been playing a game none of us knew about. My older brother, Vince started visiting our mother at the nursing home every Sunday. After his third visit, something was off. Mom started grabbing her purse whenever I walked in. She'd ask the nurses to count her jewelry. After I left, she flinched when I tried to hug her. I was lost. For 20 years, I've been the one paying her bills, driving her to appointments, making sure she had everything she needed. Vince hadn't visited once in five years. Until suddenly, he was there every week. Mom had dementia and was getting more confused. One afternoon, a nurse pulled me aside. She told me mom kept asking I was really stealing from her. I felt sick. That's when I knew Vince was feeding her lies about me. Two weeks later, mom died, still believing I was a thief. At the funeral, Vince gave this speech about family loyalty while staring right at me. Our relatives wouldn't even look at me. They whispered when I walked by. Everyone thought I robbed my dying mother. Yesterday morning, Vince called me. He said mom left me the house. You've got one week to get out. Just like that? I've been living there for three years, keep it maintained. Then he hit me with his offer. $200,000. The house was worth 800,000 easy. He called it generous, considering what I'd stolen. From mom? I told him no. His voice changed. He said, fine. I'll make sure everyone knows what you did. Your boss, your neighbors, everyone in town will know you robbed our sick mother. Two hours later, Mom's lawyer called, said he had something mom left for me at his office. He handed me an envelope with my name and mom's handwriting. Inside was a letter from two years ago. It just said, Vince has been stealing from me. I know what he's going to do. Trust me. There was a key taped to the paper. That was it. The lawyer said mom told him to only give this to me after Vince claimed the house. I had no idea what any of it meant. The key looked like a bank key, but I couldn't be sure. Why would mom write something so cryptic? That evening, I

Steady and cold. She held up the pen. This isn't a regular pen. It's a recording device. I've been documenting everything for two years. The auditorium went silent. She opened the folder, started reading like she was presenting evidence in court. She read out names of faculty members, dates of incidents, and a short report for each. A teacher mocking a student's free lunch application. refusing homework from a kid whose parent couldn't afford supplies. Bathroom passed denials during girls periods because scholarship students take advantage of privileges. Then she clicked a pen. Voices of the school's staff filled the speakers. Teachers laughing about making certain kids drop out. One voice said, scholarship trash. So clearly, everyone gasped. Kids were standing, teachers turning pale. But Zoe wasn't finished. I clicked on the projector, and text messages appeared on the screen for all to see. A group chat called Standards Committee. It was five teachers. They had a point system for making low income students transfer or drop out. The principal's wife was in the chat. So was my sister's math teacher. Screenshots showed how they'd coordinate to target the same students across multiple classes. How they deny extensions to kids working jobs while granting them freely to others. My brother went through this. Zoe said, voice crack, hacking. These teachers destroyed his scholarship three years ago. Nobody believed him. She held up the pen. He gave me this and asked me to protect the others. So I did. And now all of you will be exposed for what you've done. The auditorium was chaos. Kids shouting, teachers being escorted out. But Zoe kept talking louder. Now, I documented everything. Every comment, every targeted grade, every act of cruelty disguised as standards. Three weeks ago, a freshman girl tried to put an end to herself. She left a note about a teacher calling her a charity case and failing her because of that. That teacher is in the standards committee chat. I showed you. Then she looked directly at me. We met up outside the auditorium doors. We said every volunteering session was surveillance. Every lunch alone was reviewing recordings. That includes protecting a certain someone's little sister. Even when that someone hates me? Even when that someone draws cartoons of me that got me grounded. We both start laughing. Even when that someone tells me we're done. My stomach dropped. Lillian. She'd been protecting my sister while I bullied her, while I mocked her. So I tell her I'm sorry.

Mom burst through my bedroom door screaming and waving her arms like those inflatable tube guys at car dealerships. We're under attack by social media billionaires! Dad was right behind her yelling, they are using TikTok to steal our children's souls! They. He dragged me to the living room where mom had set up a whole presentation board with printed articles and red string connecting things like she was solving a murder. Every bad thing that's ever happened started with someone posting a selfie. She screamed while pointing at a picture of a kid holding a phone. Dad was pacing back and forth shouting, the internet is where innocence goes to die! Mom showed me a picture of a fried egg. This is your brain on Instagram. You guys are acting insane, I said. Mom literally fell to her knees sobbing. We're saving you from becoming a statistic. She snatched my phone and started deleting apps while speaking in tongues. By the power of good parenting, I cast out these digital demons. Made me sit there for three hours while they deleted every account and mom kept reading fake statistics from. Wait for it. Facebook. Did you know 90% of teens who use Snapchat and got pregnant or in jail? Dad nodded and added, that's basically everyone. At 11:30. That night, mom called our principal on his personal phone, threatening to sue the school if they let me use a computer. I heard him ask, is this some kind of prank? And mom shrieked, you think child safety is a joke? The principal tried explaining that students needed internet access for basically everything, and mom screamed, if you were a real educator, you'd use chalk like they did in the good old days. Rules kept getting crazier every single day, like they were competing to see who could be more paranoid. Mom installed cameras in my room to make sure I wasn't secretly using devices at night.

Then she saved my family. My ex best friend and I had been inseparable since third grade, when she protected me from a bigger kid trying to bully me. But then we grew up, and by junior year, everything changed. She became the teacher's pet. Always staying after class, defending teachers, first to volunteer for everything. The rest of us couldn't stand it, but there she was, practically living in the main office. Always carrying this fancy silver pen she never let anyone touch her. Brother gave it to her. She said teachers loved her. Students, not so much. Especially me. She stopped sitting with us at lunch. Started eating alone in the library. Senior year, I started the group chat. Called it Zoe's Fan Club. With a vomit emoji. Posted screenshots every time she volunteered for something. Drew a cartoon of her kissing the principal's butt. She tried talking to me once. Cornered me by my locker, hands shaking. Please just trust me, she whispered. I laughed in her face, told her we were done. The hurt in her eyes should have stopped me. My little sister, Lillian, started freshman year that fall. Within weeks, something was wrong. She'd come home crying about pop quizzes she swore never happened. Teachers marking her absent when she was there, her grades tanking despite studying every night. I blamed Lillian. You need to try harder, I kept saying while she sobbed at the kitchen. Table able. One day, Zoe left a note in my locker. Check on Lillian, please. I ripped it up. Teacher Appreciation Week arrived in May. Zoe insisted on planning everything. She organized breakfast, decorated the lounge, created a whole assembly program. The day of the assembly, I sat in the back, ready to mock her speech. The principal walked to the microphone, beaming at Zoe, even encouraging us to stand up and cheer for her. Zoe is a shining example of what dedication looks like. We hope all students can strive to be as amazing as her. Zoe walked to the podium carrying a folder and the silver pen she always has with her. She told me once it was a special pen her brother gave her. I didn't even know she had a brother. I have something to share, she said quietly. My heart stopped. I don't know how to explain it, but her voice.

They had no idea my dad killed people for a living. This happened back in my hometown in Iran, when I was 14 years old. My mom was one of the few women in our village with an actual job, and on this particular night, she was working late. Dad only got home at 3:00am, still covered in dried blood from his shift earlier. And when he saw mom wasn't home, he instantly grabbed his keys. The eldest son, I, went with him. And after what, hours of driving, we found her. My mother was lying in a bush, her hijab half torn, purple bruising around her body and in between her legs. She'd been laying there for hours, too injured to get up, and without a phone to call for help. She was somehow alive, and my dad instantly scooped her up. We could have taken her to the hospital, but my dad worked for the government and knew that doctors would look at an assaulted woman and claim she was asking for. So instead, he treated her at home, using what he Learned from his job to heal all the broken bones and injuries she had. He handmade her crutches out of wood he got from nearby trees. He helped her regain the confidence to go outside. He took over the cooking and cleaning, despite it being against our hometown law. Within five months, my Mother was back to full health. My dad originally had no plans of revenge. Whoever did this would be impossible to track back down. Until the day it happened again. Two full years after the first incident, my mother was walking home from the market in broad daylight when she was surrounded by three boys from the nearby village. They've been eyeing her for weeks. When she tried to walk by them, they formed a tight circle around her and started closing in. First, they took her hijab, ripping it off her and tearing it into pieces. When my mother tried to protest, the oldest slapped her across the face. She fell into the sand. And once she was on the ground, things got worse. They dragged her by force into an alleyway where nobody could see or hear her scream and did things to her I don't want to describe. She only made it home because another woman found her in that alleyway and recognized her. When the front door opened and I saw my mom on this woman's shoulders, struggling to breathe, I felt the worst case of deja vu. Throughout the next couple of months, I saw a different side of dad. He was the tender, loving, and caring husband he'd always been. But when he thought nobody was watching, I saw this rage in his eyes I'd never seen. He started making calls, suddenly carrying guns tucked under

He regretted it when I stopped checking them entirely. My son Geo stormed through the front door last Monday, slamming it so hard the pictures shook. He threw his backpack against the wall and glared at me. You're the worst mom in the entire junior class! He shouted, his face red with anger. I was sitting at the kitchen table reviewing his SAT prep schedule I'd carefully planned out. Every other mom trust their kid. Louis's mom never checks his grades. Eddie's mom doesn't force him to study on weekends. Sarah's mom says she doesn't believe in college. He was practically shaking. Now you treat me like I'm 5 years old. I can't breathe without you asking about homework or college essays or AP score. I tried to explain that junior year determines college options. That's all you care about! He yelled, my GPA, not me! Eddie's mom told him, CS are fine. You freak out over 1 B+! My chest tightened hearing this. I only stressed so much because I wanted him to succeed. Fine, I said, quietly closing my laptop. From now on, your grades are your responsibility. That night, I lay awake thinking about my own past. I'd grown up, or watched my single mom work three jobs just to rent. I'd studied by candlelight when the power got cut off. I watched my mom starve herself so she could feed me. Got into state School on scholarships I fought for. Now I made decent money. The nurse and Geo would never know that struggle, but maybe I was projecting my fears onto him. The next morning I deleted the app to check his grades from my phone. When Geo mentioned he had a calculus test, I just nodded and kept making breakfast. He looked confused but pleased. By Wednesday he was playing video games instead of studying. I didn't say anything. Friday came and he skipped his SAT prep class to hang out with Eddie and Lewis. I bit my tongue and said nothing. The next week he started coming home later saying he was at study groups. I didn't question it even though.

No, he's not. I just watched him walk inside. Mrs. Stevenson's face went pale. Well, he didn't make it to my classroom. She looked at her attendance records. In fact, Theo hasn't made it to my classroom at all for the past three weeks. My stomach dropped. That's impossible, I stammered out. I've been dropping him off every morning and staying until I personally see him go in. Missus Stevenson hesitated, then picked up her classroom phone. I think you need to speak with Principal Miles right now. We walked through the hallway in silence. Other teachers kept glancing at us and looking away quickly. The principal's secretary was already crying when we arrived, like she knew something. Principal Miles had security footage pulled up on his computer. Come look at this. The screen showed the front entrance. There was Theo scanning his ID badge at 7:00am, walking toward the classroom with his Dinosaur backpack. The timestamp read October 24th This morning. Mister Davis, watch what happens next. Camera angle switched to the main hallway. I could see Theo in the morning crowd of kids. He walked toward his classroom hallway, then suddenly veered left toward the gym. The time stamp showed 7:48 a m. Another camera angle. The gym hallway. Theo pushed through the emergency exit door. A man in a hard hat and construction vest was waiting. Theo climbed Into a white pickup truck, they drove away. The time stamp, 7:49 a m. That's been happening every morning for three weeks. Miles. His voice was shaking. We presume this was authorized. The man said he was Theo's uncle, picking him up for family medical appointments. He showed me a folder. Dozens of permission slips with my forged signature. I've been trying to call you, but the number on file was disconnected. That's when Mrs. Stevenson interrupted. Mr. Davis, there's something else. CPS is coming to your house today at eleven a m. They received a report about educational neglect. If Theo isn't there, if we can't prove where he's been, you could. In custody. My hands were shaking as I pulled out Theo's phone from my pocket. He'd forgotten it in the car. The screen lit up with notifications. 47 unread messages, all from Uncle Mike. My blood went cold. Uncle Mike was Theo's stepdad's uncle. I opened the messages. Don't tell your dad. You know what happens if you tell. The last message sent this morning at 7:30 a m. If you don't come today, you'll never see your mom.

Then her piggy bank was suddenly empty. I went to grab some quarters from my daughter's piggy bank for parking and found nothing but three pennies rolling around inside. Layla was only seven and had been saving up for months to buy a new bike with all her birthday and tooth fairy money. The piggy bank felt way too light when I picked it up, and those three pennies made this sad little noise when I shook it. When Layla got home from school, I sat her down at the kitchen table with her favourite snack. Sweetie, where did all your piggy bank money go? She kept her eyes on her shoes and mumbled something I couldn't hear. What was that, honey? I asked gently. I gave it all to Aubrey, she finally said louder. She never has lunch money, and yesterday the lunch lady didn't let her eat. My heart swelled with pride, but I was also confused. Why didn't this kid have lunch money? The next morning, I gave Layla five extra dollars. Give this to Aubrey for lunch today, okay? She jumped up and threw her arms around me. Thanks, Mommy. You're the best, she said, before running to catch the bus. I couldn't stop thinking about why some kid didn't have lunch money every single day. Because as even when money was tight, we always figured it out. Around lunchtime, my phone rang. This is Principal Rouse, could you come in for a meeting about Layla? Twenty minutes later, I was sitting in the principal's office. Your daughter has been giving money to another student, which is technically against school policy, but we need to talk about the whole situation here. I braced myself. Aubrey's family has been going through a lot. We can't share all the details, but your daughter has been making sure that child eats lunch every day. She paused and looked at me carefully. The family applied for free lunch, but there's a waiting period and tons of paperwork. Meanwhile, we have a seven year old going hungry. I felt my throat get tight. So Layla can keep helping her, right? The principal smiled for the first time. Of course. And we appreciate your kindness. Actually, Aubrey's mother has been asking about you. She wants to pay you back, but she's too embarrassed to reach

The clitoris is that math subject we had to take in high school. Oh, no, That's called calculus. Uh, clitoris is that stuff you use to grease your pan before you cook something.

The guy who sailed over to America on the Mayflower. He sailed the ocean blue. No, that's Columbus. Clitoris are the specialized shoes that you wear outside when playing sports on turf. Now, what you're talking about are cleats. No, sweetie, what clitoris is is actually those big, puffy white clouds that you see in the sky. What? No, bro, you're wrong. That's actually cumulus.

I just got out of target, and I was standing in line behind a mom and her daughter waiting to check out. The girl was goofing around, messing around, looking at me and smiling. Of course, I was obliging because I love these little moments. She's showing me her preschool folder. I think she looked about four or five, maybe. I don't know. Out of nowhere, she looks at me and says, today I figured out that if I hold the sides of my butt, I can't even get it out. If I hold the sides of my butt open, my farts don't make noises. I started laughing. The girl started laughing, and the mom whips her head around like she was mortified. I said, don't worry about it. This is life changing news for me. Frankly, I was a little annoyed. I hadn't have thought about this yet in my life. So if you're the mom of Maggie Lucille that was at target this morning in south central Pennsylvania, your girl's going places.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you wanna know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 / 4 and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of it. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man, Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. If you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets at 52.3% Of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the snaps, he'll get another two.

And Jack decided to find the two smallest commanders fans who were just standing there doing nothing, and knocked this guy out. But he gives this guy a right hook for no reason and started randomly assaulting this other guy, in which, after the fact, he starts flexing and says that I don't fucking lose. And that viral video was even liked by Lamar Jackson. But NFL fans really didn't like this move, so they decided to ruin this guy's life. They first found his Facebook page, where it listed his job. And once that happened, everyone else started chiming in with their stories about it, like this guy saying, I knew this kid throughout high school. He's a total piece of shit. I kicked out of three different Baltimore private schools. And a notable moment was his expulsion from Saint Paul's for putting his hmm. On a kid with special needs. He's disgusting, but his father's absolutely loaded, super rich. His expulsion story should tell you all you need to know. But it gets so Much worse, he was

And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush. And Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt, and although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully, Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sits At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the snaps.

Now, at first look, you're like, 66 players with the GPA over 3.5. Like, that's good. But then that left us with some questions. If 66 players on the team have really good GPS, how did you get such a low average? Now, for what it's worth, a team GPS that is good is considered 2.3 or higher. So this 2.72, not too bad. Then people started to do some digging on this team. They found that the UMHB Crusader football team has 192 players. 192! There are 18 quarterbacks on this football team.

So this man right here is Shamar Stewart from Texas a M. He was drafted 17th overall by the Bengals this year. But Shamar here is the only first round pick to not have signed his rookie contract yet because the Bengals are trying to shaft him. this dispute happening with Shamar in the Bengals isn't about money. He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing is cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term, they can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team and he's actually been practicing with Texas a m. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL because 1, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible but not likely. Number two.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you wanna know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 / 4 and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of it. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man, Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. If you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets at 52.3% Of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the snaps, he'll get another 200.

The 13 year old boy used a slingshot to save his sister from the kidnappers, but he was sued by the kidnappers and taken to court demanding compensation of eight thousand thousand dollars from the boy's mother. On May 10th, 13 year old Owen Burns from Michigan heard his sister's plea for help while playing video games at home. He then saw a 17 year old Terrence Coleman kidnap his 8 year old sister and drag her into the woods. He quickly grabbed the slingshot, loaded it with marbles and both of his shots hit the kidnappers. Due to pain, the kidnapper released his sister and fled the scene. It is reported that Terrence first suffered a chest injury and the severe pain made him mistakenly believe that he had been shot. Owen fired another shot, this time hitting Terence's eye and successfully saving his sister. Afterwards, Terence's family filed a lawsuit against Owen's mother because the doctor informed Terence that his right eye will be permanently blind. Terrence's family insists that he was just playing with the girl, not kidnapping. They claim that Owen caused Terrence to go blind for no reason and demand compensation of eight thousand thousand dollars. This case is still under investigation. If he wasn't kidnapping, why did he take someone else's child into the woods and run away?

Because sure enough he found that his guitar was very badly damaged. So he calls United Airlines help line where they tell him that he he's going to have to come back the next day, but he has a show that night. So he gets a taxi as quickly as possible to a nearby repair shop where they charge him twelve hundred dollars to fix his guitar. he called the airline the next day to ask them to pay for the repairs, but they refuse telling him that it's too too late now because he should have filed a complaint the day it happened, which he tried to do. So that's when he decided it was time to get revenge. He got a few of his friends together to write a song dissing United Airlines, thinking it would just be a funny joke. But although the airline wasn't concerned about the song at first, it suddenly started to get attention so they freaked out, then told him they would pay the 12 if he took the song down, but he refused saying it was too late because they should have contacted him the day he posted it. That song ended up getting 19 million views which cost United Airlines over 10 million.

Due to pain, the kidnapper released his sister and fled the scene. It is reported that Terrence first suffered a chest injury and the severe pain made him mistakenly believe that he had been shot. Owen fired another shot, this time hitting Terence's eye and successfully saving his sister. Afterwards, Terence's family filed a lawsuit against Owen's mother because the doctor informed Terence that his right eye will be permanently blind. Terrence's family insists that he was just playing with the girl, not kidnapping. They claim that Owen caused Terrence to go blind for no reason and demand compensation of eight thousand thousand dollars. This case is still under investigation. If he wasn't kidnapping, why did he take someone else's child into the woods and run away?

So he calls United Airlines help line where they tell him that he, he's going to have to come back the next day, but he has a show that night. So he gets a taxi as quickly as possible to a nearby repair shop where they charge him 12 dollars to fix his guitar. he called the airline the next day to ask them to pay for the repairs, but they refuse, telling him that it's too, too late now because he should have filed a complaint the day it happened, which he tried to do. So that's when he decided it was time to get revenge. He got a few of his friends together to write a song dissing United Airlines, thinking it would just be a funny joke. But although the airline wasn't concerned about the song at first, it suddenly started to get attention. So they freaked out, then told him they would pay the 12 if he took the song down. But he refused saying it was too late because they should have contacted him the day he posted it. That song ended up getting 19 million views, which cost United Airlines over 10 million.

Got chalked at 8:30. I came back at 12:30. The truck marks are still on it. So I wrote it for a two hour violation. But Brennan is violating the Constitution Michigan who argued that marking tires is similar to police secretly putting a GPS on a vehicle without a proper warrant. That's a violation of the 4th Amendment right against unreasonable searches. I don't mind at all. I think it's a chalk wipes off very, very easily. So it's not a problem. The court, which covers four Midwest states, ruled that now a warrant is needed because the purpose of marking tires is to raise revenue and not for public safety. Ken Kissell, who owns Livewire Security in Irvington, says the chalking keeps three spots open for customers. So somebody can run in, run out and not have to worry about getting a ticket for just being parked for 5 minutes like you do with a lot of other towns that have parking meters. In the meantime, the village is considering more high tech options.

A customer was dissatisfied with the temperature of the spicy soup and poured boiling soup onto the cashier, causing serious injuries to the cashier. At present, the victim has filed a lawsuit seeking compensation of $3 million. Thirty one year old Amanda Nicole Martinez previously ordered a takeout menu soup to bring home. Subsequently, she angrily returned to the store, claiming that the temperature of the soup was too high and that the plastic from the takeaway box had melted and fallen into the soup. Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave, otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off, but the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

A man picked up his wife and threw her towards the TV like a rag doll while she desperately begged, please don't do this. All of this happened in front of their five month old child who witnessed the entire scene but was powerless to intervene, leaving an indelible traumatic memory. The man is 31 year old Zach Stacy, a former New York Jets running back. Later he was only sentenced to one month in prison after admitting to the crime of criminal injury. The newly exposed video shows the severity of the incident where they had a heated argument over a rent payment issue. His wife Kristen Evans attempted to escape, but he chased after her and used a trash can to smash the car, even grabbing the car's wiper. According to a home surveillance video, Zack first hit Evans twice on the back of the head with an unidentified object and picked him up and threw him heavily towards the TV. Please, please, please. Evans can be heard constantly pleading with him to stop. Even in front of their 5 month old child, Zack continues to commit violence. Afterwards, Evans said in an interview that she didn't want Zach to stay in prison for even a day. No one wants to send their son's father to prison. Zach was charged with serious assault and criminal damage and sentenced to one month in prison. At present, this mother and son are receiving psychological and legal support. Do you think he should not go to jail?

A customer was dissatisfied with the temperature of the spicy soup and poured boiling soup onto the cashier causing serious injuries to the cashier. At present, the victim has filed a lawsuit seeking compensation of $3 million. Thirty one year old Amanda Nicole Martinez previously ordered a take out menu soup to bring home. Subsequently, she angrily returned to the store claiming that the temperature of the soup was too high and that the plastic from the takeaway box had melted and fallen into the soup. Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave. Otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off. But the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

When their father, Jamil Penn returned home, he smelled the smell of grilled meat and thought it was his wife cooking. When he walked into the kitchen, he realized that something terrible had happened. His two children are in the oven. By the time he rescued them, it was already too late. Jamil trembled and dialed 9 1 1 to report the incident. The police arrived at the scene and immediately arrested their mother, 24 year old Lamora Williams. Even more heartbreaking is that investigators are no longer able to identify two children. Lamora told the police that she doesn't know who killed her child. Then she blamed her cousin for the crime. And finally she said it was her sister who killed the children. She is uncertain and provided false information. Lemora is charged with two counts of murder. But in court, Lemora's sister claimed that Lemora had suffered from serious mental health problems since childhood. She even tried to end her own life. After psychological evaluation, it was confirmed that Lamora William has cognitive impairment. The final judge sentenced her to 5 years in prison. Do you think this is a fair judgment?

He was quickly arrested. The judge sentenced him to 13 years in prison. But when it was time to be imprisoned, no police came to take him away. He didn't try to escape because he knew he deserved it. He just waited nervously in his own home, expecting the police to appear at any moment. Several weeks have passed and the police have not come yet. He thought that the police might have revoked his criminal record. So in the following years, he continued his life and completely forgot about it. He got married, started a construction company and even took the initiative to help young people, avoiding them from repeating his mistakes. But 13 years later, the police suddenly came to his house and arrested him, which shocked him greatly. Originally, due to a technical issue, the police thought he was in prison for the past 13 years. When they were about to release him, they realized he wasn't there at all. So they immediately sent police to arrest him. When the police told him that he must now complete his 13 year prison sentence, he collapsed in court. The judge saw that Michael had completely changed his life and successfully reformed himself. So he released him and did not let him serve another sentence in prison.

Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave. Otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off. But the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

He got married, launched a construction company, and volunteered to help youth avoid making the same mistakes he made. But 13 years later, he was shocked when police suddenly arrived at his house to arrest him. It turns out because of a technical issue, police thought he was in jail for the last 13 years, but when they went to release him, they realized he wasn't there, so they sent police to immediately arrest him. He was devastated when they told him he now had to spend 13 years in prison to serve his sentence. when the judge saw that Michael had completely turned his life around and rehabilitated himself, he set him free with no jail time.

But the next morning, he got a shocking call from the army sergeant. Turns out he accidentally broke the pull up record, and now the army wanted him to enlist. Since he wasn't doing great in school, his parents actually agreed and sent him to basic training, which meant he had just five days before being transferred to a real military base. But instead of panicking, he came up with the funniest escape plan ever. For the first two days, he quietly watched the sergeants taking notes on each recruit. How many push UPS they could do, how fast they ran, everything. He noticed they kept all the records in a small office near the dorms. So one night, he snuck in and edited the notes. On the final day, he intentionally bombed the pull up test. The sergeant was confused. This was the same kid and who crushed the record back at school. But then the guy told him he must be confusing him with his identical twin brother, Tay. When the sergeant checked the school notes, sure enough, Tay was now listed as the pull up champ. So they sent the guy home. But later that week, Tay got a surprise call from the army.

Fast and you don't have to worry about the paint or body or anything. Please, it'll be fun. Alright, I'll do it. Give me the keys. Haha, that's what I'm talking about. So now what do you think of the Sylvia? Oh, it's nice. I thought you said they were unbuilt though. That shit felt way faster than stock. Might have lied just to get you in the car. That's just pushing over 4:50 to the wheel. Are you sneaky ass? Hey, but ain't you glad you came? You're right, man. I really appreciate you. Letting me borrow your car.

You ever seen that video of those three GT3 RS lined up, then they all start going and then take off? Oh yeah, the video is pretty sick. Well, that sound you heard is launch control, but what's it do? Well, as the name suggests, it controls your launch so you get the best launch possible. Wait, but don't you just floor it to take off? If you over Rev it, your tires can spin out leading to a bad launch. If you under Rev it, you're not gonna have enough power to launch the car, also leading to a bad launch. There's a perfect sweet spot in your RPMs as ideal for launching at this point. You're not over revving it and you're not under revving it is just right like Goldilocks and the three bears. Yeah, exactly like that. Launch control is when your car's computer limits the RPMs when you're at a standstill. That way you as the driver don't have to worry about over revving or under revving. You trust in the launch control and then you take off. It helps out a ton in racing, which is why it usually comes in a lot of sportier cars. But the cool thing is there are cars that don't come with it, but you could tune it in after as a feature. So is this only for automatics or could you do launch control in a manual? No, there are some manuals That have been tuned to have launch control. It's not common, but it's possible. Huh? Cool. What about two stepping? Is that the same thing? No, it's not. We'll get into that next time.

Yeah, I literally just got it. What? That's huge, bro. Congrats. Thanks. I gotta ask, how old are you? Cause you look really young and I know those are very expensive. I turned 18 this year. You're only 17. How'd you afford one of those? I didn't need to do anything. I got it for free. Come on, man. Quit playing. You do e commerce, Amazon, FBA. What are you doing? Nothing. I literally got it for free. That was my grandpa's car. He's too old to drive it now. My dad doesn't really care about cars, so I was next in line. Dude, that is astronomically insane. Is it auto or manual? Manual. GE or GTE? G tea. Wow. Manual turbo Supra for free. Hey, man, don't ever sell that thing. Okay. Well, to be honest with you, I'm not really a fan of Toyotas. I was thinking about selling it, bro. What? Why? You know how lucky you are. Hey, but if you're for real selling it, let me know. Shoot, you're the only person that knows about the car right now. You wanna buy it? What's the catch? There's no catch. I just like European cars more. Is that so? Would you possibly entertain the idea of a trade for an E36 M3 in turn

My wife Julia walked into our bedroom while I was booking dinner reservations for her birthday next month. She announced, I need you to understand my career comes before this marriage. I stopped typing and looked at her. We've been married for three years, and I'd work double shifts to pay bills while she was in business school. For our marriage? I asked. She rolled her eyes. My mentor, Bradley, says mixing personal life with business is weakness. Real success requires sacrifice, she told me. Bradley had been texting her during dinner lately. From now on, work is the priority. Not birthdays, not holidays, not your needs, he continued. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I already told Bradley you're holding me back, he says. That's typical. She added, wait. She told her mentor I was holding her back after everything I've done? So everything comes second to work? I asked. She nodded firmly. Everything. Bradley made millions by 35 because he never let emotions interfere. I thought about arguing, but decided on something else. That's what you want, I told her. Julia smiled and immediately started texting someone. She thought I'd cave? Nope. Her birthday came three weeks later. Usually I'd plan something special. This year, nothing. She came home to a regular Tuesday. Did you forget? She asked, looking confused. Birthdays are personal. Career comes first, remember? I replied. Her face dropped. But you always do something She said quietly. I shrugged. You said celebrations were distractions. He ordered takeout and ate alone while I watched TV. I heard her on the phone with someone later. No, he didn't do anything. Yeah, I'm alone. She was saying, good. Let her explain that to her friends. Her company's investor gala was next month. We leave at seven, she announced. I stayed on the couch. I'm not going, I told her. She froze. Everyone brings spouses. People will ask questions, he said. You said mixing personal with professional was weakness. I reminded her. She begged. Please, just this once, I asked. Bradley says emotions interfere with success, right? She left alone. My buddy Tom.

Connie was devastated. Bobby moved on and married Sandra D. This marriage was a little bit chaotic. Connie's record label was basically threatening to drop her. But her father, who was just a smitch, controlling, was determined to make her a star. He was like, listen, you need to remake the song who's sorry now? She was over it. She was like, uh, uh. But she did it. Dick Clark played it on American Bandstand and it was a hit. She became an overnight sensation. Even though she found success with her career, her personal life was a little bit messier. Connie was married four times, and none of these marriages stuck. When she was 27, she married a press agent named Dick Connellis. This marriage lasted about four months. Seven years later, she married Izzy Marion. He was a hairdresser. This marriage lasted 10 months. A couple of years later, she married husband No. 3, Joe Garzelli. Together they adopted a son named Joe junior. This was her longest marriage. It lasted five years. But during this marriage, in 1974, when she was 37 years old, she was appearing at a music festival. She returned to her motel. She was brutally assaulted. She was raped. There was a mattress thrown onto her. She almost suffocated.

Even now, 63 years after this single came out, pretty little baby Connie Francis is going viral. Connie was the first true pop star of the rock and roll era. She had 35 Top 40 hits in a decade. She sang in 15 languages. But behind her fame, Connie Francis went through a lot. She was born on December 12, 1937 in Newark, New Jersey. She's a Sagittarius. She was born Concetta Rosa Maria Franconero. Her family, Italian American. Her father George, mother Ida and little brother George junior were all very close. When she was 12 years old, she started singing professionally. She played the accordion guardian and her father would enter her in pageants and talent shows. The next year, she started going by Connie Francis because it was easier to pronounce. When she was just 16, she signed a record deal with MGM Records. Even though she was signed to a label early on, her songs weren't really hitting it. She was hired to be Tuesday Weld's singing voice in the movie Rock, Rock, Rock. Remember I just talked about her? She started working with up and coming singer Bobby Darren. They were both young, starting to get famous and they fell for each other hard. But when her pops found out, he was furious. And as the story goes, he started chasing Bobby around the house with a pew, pew.

Al ver eso, la chica dese√≥ evaporarse en ese instante. Fue hasta ese momento que se dio cuenta de que durante un mes entero hab√≠a estado chateando con el jefe pensando que era su mam√°. Resulta que la chica depend√≠a mucho de su madre, contaba cada cosa de su d√≠a a d√≠a, pero el jefe y su mam√° ten√≠an el mismo avatar y nombre en whatsapp, as√≠ que ella confundi√≥ al jefe con su mam√° y hasta bloque√≥ a su verdadera madre pensando que era una estafadora. El jefe, al recibir los mensajes, pens√≥ en decirle la verdad de inmediato, pero se top√≥ con varios mensajes donde ella despoticaba contra la empresa diciendo que la secretaria solo sab√≠a coquetear con el jefe y buscaba c√≥mo arrimarse al poder. Al ver a la secretaria pavonearse a su lado, el jefe tambi√©n lo consider√≥ inapropiado. La rega√±√≥ en el acto y le dijo que se vistiera con decencia. Luego, para calmar los √°nimos en la oficina, le pidi√≥ que fuera a comprar caf√© para los empleados, pero apenas sali√≥ le pas√≥ la tarea a la chica. Ella como practicante tuvo que aguantar y obedecer y otra vez le escribi√≥ a su mam√° para quejarse. √âl, jefe, al leer eso, sali√≥ de inmediato a reprender a la secretaria, dici√©ndole que √©l se lo pidi√≥ A ella, practicante y que si no le gustaba pod√≠a irse de la empresa. La secretaria se fue furiosa a comprar caf√©. Justo en ese momento la mejor amiga de la chica lo vio todo y se encendi√≥. Su alma chismosa. Sospech√≥ que hab√≠a algo entre su amiga y su hermano, el jefe, as√≠ que fue a preguntarle directamente. Pero √©l no tuvo piedad, le quit√≥ su mesada y la ech√≥ de la oficina. Ella no sab√≠a que su hermano ya le hab√≠a echado el ojo a la chica. Mientras tanto, la chica segu√≠a escribi√©ndole a su mam√°. En tono de amenaza cari√±osa. Le dijo que si no respond√≠a tendr√≠a que mandarle un sobre rojo de doscientos pesos. El jefe lo ley√≥ y le transfiri√≥ veinte cero cero cero. Sin decir palabra, la chica se qued√≥ congelada. Justo entonces la secretaria regres√≥ con un mont√≥n de caf√©. La chica aprovech√≥ para tomarle una foto en ese estado y se la mand√≥ a su mam√° diciendo que la secretaria solo quer√≠a meterse la cama del jefe y que viv√≠a amarg√°ndole la vida a los dem√°s. Tambi√©n le cont√≥ ella dec√≠a que iba a encargarse del evento del aniversario, pero en realidad nunca hac√≠a nada y siempre se llevaba el cr√©dito del trabajo ajeno. El jefe al leer todo eso se puso furioso y anunci√≥ que evento del aniversario lo manejar√≠a completamente la chica. La secretaria qued√≥ en shock, mientras que la mejor amiga Chica lo disfrutaba al m√°ximo y estaba segura de que el jefe estaba enamorado. Pero la chica se asust√≥ y le tap√≥ la boca, diciendo que todo era una coincidencia y que adem√°s ten√≠a un compromiso de matrimonio. La amiga corri√≥ a contarle esto al jefe justo cuando √©l recib√≠a una llamada de la abuela. Ella le dijo que ir√≠a al aniversario. ¬øQu√© llevar√≠a a su futura nuera? Le pidi√≥ que se comportara como debe. El jefe mir√≥ hacia la chica que segu√≠a trabajando sin parar, pensaba decir que no, sin saber que la chica era justo su prometida. La abuela quiso mandarle una foto de ella, pero por la mala se√±al no logr√≥ enviarla. Lleg√≥ el d√≠a del aniversario. La chica estaba ajustando los equipos sin saber que ten√≠a en la mano el celular del jefe. Tampoco sab√≠a que la secretaria ya hab√≠a sobornado al t√©cnico y planeaba hacerla quedar en rid√≠culo cuando ella no miraba. La secretaria subi√≥ unos archivos vergonzosos al tel√©fono. Poco despu√©s, la abuela lleg√≥ al evento y reconoci√≥ de inmediato a la chica. En ese momento, el t√©cnico encendi√≥ el proyector y la chica mand√≥ otro mensaje cari√±oso. Por costumbre. Cuando el jefe abri√≥ el mensaje, todo lo que hab√≠an hablado se proyect√≥ en la pantalla gigante. La sala estall√≥. La secretaria se qued√≥ paralizada sin entender qu√© pasaba y los apodos cari√±osos entre los dos desataron una ola de chismes entre los empleados.

I found the messages with her coworker. I waited until their company merger went live, then sent the screenshots to the press. She said it on a Sunday morning over coffee. I've fallen out of love with you. Sunlight through the kitchen window, French roast in the air. Six years together, engaged for eight months. I set down my mug. What? I don't feel it anymore, she said. Eyes her spoon. I think we should end things. My chest went tight. Is there someone else? No, too fast. I just need to be honest with myself. With us. She stirred sugar into her coffee. She'd never liked it. Sweet, okay, I said. Her eyes flicked up, surprised, like she expected me to beg. Okay, if that's how you feel. She moved out that week, took her clothes, her books, half the furniture. I helped her pack. Calm, polite, like we were co workers ending a project. She kept saying she was sorry, that she hoped we could stay friends. I just nodded. The nights after she left were long and silent. I, I couldn't sleep. Just lay there replaying everything frame by frame. Then I remembered her laptop. We shared passwords, devices, accounts. She'd never changed them. I opened her messages and there it was. Months of texts with someone named Marcus, her coworker, just a friend from the office. The messages started friendly, then flirty, then explicit. I can't stop thinking about You last night was incredible. When can we do it again? I scrolled up, trace the timeline. It started four months ago, right when she got busy with work. The night she cancelled our venue visit. She'd been with him. I kept reading, then saw the most recent messages. The merger goes live next month. After that, we can finally be public. Can't wait. No more hiding. The merger, the one she'd been talking about non stop. Marcus VP at the competing company. I sat back, hands shaking, then breathing, then still. I closed the laptop and started planning. For three weeks, I said nothing. Didn't reply to her checking in texts, didn't ask about Marcus, but I was collecting screenshots of every message, every photo, every time stamp. Found out Marcus was married, two kids, his wife's Instagram full of family vacations. I checked his company's ethics policy, relationships between executives forbidden. He signed a morality clause. Scandal equals termination. Perfect. I compiled it all, a neat folder of destruction. Then I waited. The merger announcement was October 15th. Huge press event. Both CEOs, executives from both sides, my ex, Marcus cameras, live streams. A week before she texted me, hey, I know this is weird, but I wanted you to know I'm seeing someone. I hope that's okay. I typed back, that's great. I'm happy for you. She sent a heart emoji. October 15th, I woke early, made coffee, opened my laptop, pulled up emails for three business reporters covering The merger typed one short message, thought you should know about an ethics violation involving two executives at today's merger announcement. Screenshots attached, attached everything. The next, the photos, the timeline. Marcus's claws, his wife's Instagram hit send. 8:00am press conference 10, I turned on the live stream. At 9:55, the ballroom gleamed. Glass podium, corporate banners, flashing cameras. My ex stood to the right in a navy suit, Marcus beside her, confident, perfect. The CEO started his speech. Growth projections, shared vision, synergy. At 10:23, a journalist raised his hand. Excuse me, I have a question about an internal ethics matter. The room quieted. Can you comment on the romantic relationship between two executives here today? He said their names. My ex froze. Marcus's smile vanished. The CEO blinked. What are you referring to? The reporter lifted his phone. We've received explicit messages between them dating back months. It violates both company's ethics codes. Another journalist stood. And Marcus's morality clause signed last year that would void his position. Correct. The CEO's expression turned to stone. He turned to them. Is this true? Marcus stammered. We, it's not. My ex just stood there, eyes wide. The chat feed blew up. Thousands watching live. The CEO whispered to his assistant. Security stepped forward. Sir, ma'am, please come with us, one reporter called out. We've also confirmed Marcus is married, two children. Gasps from the room. Marcus went red. My ex looked like she might faint. The CEO face the cameras. This press conference is over. We will investigate these allegations immediately. The feed cut out. By noon, it was everywhere. Merger implodes amid executive affair scandal. VP fired for violating morality clause. Marcus terminated. My ex spended under review. The merger postponed indefinitely. My phone buzzed non stop. Unknown numbers, reporters asking for comments. I turned it off. That evening she called from another number. I let it ring. Her voicemail, drew, please, I know it was you. You ruined my life, my career, everything. I deleted it. Full story on the channel linked below.

I said, perfect, and stayed calm. The next day, I sold the land it was built on and disappeared. By morning there were 42 missed calls and my mother was crying. Fine. My father said it at Sunday dinner. We've decided to give the house to your sister. The dining room smelled like roast chicken and lemon cleaner. The house I'd helped renovate, the one I'd pay taxes on for three years when they couldn't. Rachel sat across from me, smiling like she'd won something. The whole house? I asked. Yes, my mother said. Rachel needs it more. She has the kids, you're single. You have your apartment. Been paying their mortgage $1,200 a month for four years. Rachel hadn't paid a cent. You understand, don't you? My father said, family helps family. I looked at them, then at Rachel, her smug little smile. Perfect. I said softly. That makes sense. My mother blinked. Really? Yeah. Rachel needs it more. They looked relieved. Rachel squeezed my hand. Thank you for understanding. Of course, I said. I finished dinner, helped with dishes, drove home in silence. I didn't know about the land. Ten years ago, my grandmother left it to me in her will. Not the house, just the land beneath it. A legal quirk from an old subdivision. My parents inherited the house. I inherited the dirt under it. They never read the paperwork, never asked questions. They just assumed It was all theirs. I'd let them live there, pay the taxes, fix the roof, because that's what family does. Family helps family. After that dinner, I went home and pulled out the deed at my kitchen table, read it three times. The land was mine. Legally, entirely. They could have the house, but without the land, it was worthless. I called a real estate attorney the next morning. Can I sell land that has a house on it? Of course, he said. You own the land. The structure is the buyer's problem. They'll either buy it or vacate. And if they don't, eviction's an option. I smiled. How fast can we close? If you have a buyer, a week. I did. A developer had reached out five years ago wanting to build town homes in that area. Offered me $340,000. I said no then, because my parents live there. But things change. I called him, still interested in the property. He didn't hesitate. Absolutely. I can have paperwork ready tomorrow. Do it. I. For the next week, I acted normal. Texted my mom about her doctor's visit, sent Rachel a baby gift. They thought everything was fine. Friday morning, the sale closed. $340,000 hit my account by noon. By three PM, certified letters went out. The land beneath your property has been sold. You have 30 days to purchase the parcel or vacate. I packed a bag, drove three hours north to a cabin with no cell service. When I turned my phone back on Monday morning. I had 42 missed calls. 37 from my mother, five from my father, 16 voicemails. The first was my mother sobbing, what did you do? You can't just sell the land. That's our house! The second, my father. You're destroying your family over money. We gave you everything! The third. Rachel, you selfish bastard! Mom's having a breakdown. The kids are terrified. Grow up! I deleted them all. Then came the texts. My mother, please, we'll give you the house. Just this. My father. The developer wants DOLLAR500K. We can't pay that. Please call me Rachel. You're making your nieces homeless. Hope you're proud. I turned the phone face down. Watch the lake outside my window ripple. A week later, my lawyer called. Your parents want to negotiate, he said. For what? They're asking if you'll buy the land back and lease it to them. No. They're threatening to sue. On what grounds? None that hold up. Then let them try. By the end of the month, they did. Claimed adverse possession. Said they'd lived there long enough to own the land. But I'd paid the taxes every year. The judge ruled for the developer. 60 days to vacate. My mother called one last time. I answered. Hello? Silence. Then quiet. Crying. How could you? We raised you. Where are your parents? You were giving the house to Rachel. I said evenly. I just gave the land to someone else. That's different. Is it? You decided I didn't deserve the house because Rachel needed it more. I decided you didn't deserve the land because someone else wanted it more. She tried again. We never would have known I had leverage. That I wasn't just your safety net. She sobbed. You said family helps family. I continue. I helped you for years. Paid your mortgage, taxes, everything. The moment you didn't need me, you cut me out. Please. You have 60 days. I said quietly, start packing. I hung up. Blocked every number. Full story on the channel

So there's this guy in my grade who's basically allergic to not being the center of attention, like physically cannot handle not being the main character of every situation. He's the type who'd light his shoes on fire if he thought it would get him 5 seconds of fame. Last year, he literally jumped out of a second story window during lunch to impress some girl he barely knew, broke his ankle in three places, got suspended for a month. We all figured that would be his wake up call, you know, like maybe almost breaking his entire leg would teach him that attention isn't worth permanent damage. It didn't. First day back from suspension and he walked into school like he'd won a medal. Everyone was talking about the window thing and you could tell he was loving every second. He had this huge boot on his foot and was milking it for everything it was worth. By third period, I already had a bad feeling about what was coming next. Fast forward to sixth period art class. It's right after lunch. Everyone's half asleep and our teacher is this older lady who's way too trusting for her own good. She leaves the room constantly. This particular day she stepped out to grab more supplies from the storage closet down the hall. The second, and I mean the exact second, that door Clicked shut. This kid's eyes light up. He looks around the room with this expression like he just discovered fire. Then he reaches across the table and grabs two tubes of acrylic paint, bright blue, holds them up over his head like trophies and announces to the entire class, 20 bucks as I can drink both of these right now. The room explodes. Everyone's immediately yelling at him, dude, no, that's literal poison. You're gonna die. But he's already got this grin on his face. I realize with complete horror that he's not joking. This is actually happening. He unscrews the cap off the first tube while we're all still protesting. I legitimately thought he was bluffing like this was some elaborate bit and he chicken out at the last second. He didn't. He tilted his head back, opened his mouth and squeeze that entire tube of paint straight down his throat like it was a go gurt. Bright blue paint. I watched it disappear. The whole class went silent, just staring in disbelief. Then he wiped his mouth, grabbed the second tube and did it again. For a moment, nothing happened. He's standing there.

My daughter Riley, has severe dyslexia. Reading out loud is torture for her. She stumbles over words, takes forever to get through sentences, and kids usually snicker. Her regular teacher, Missus Henderson, understood this and had developed subtle ways to avoid putting Riley on the spot. But last Tuesday, Riley came home sobbing harder than I'd seen in months. Missus Henderson was out sick, and they had a substitute named Miss Williams. This woman had zero understanding of learning disabilities and decided to go around the room having each student read a full paragraph from their history textbook. Riley tried to explain that she had accommodations, but Miss Williams cut her off. Everyone needs to participate equally. No special treatment. So Riley had to stumble through an entire paragraph about the Revolutionary War while 28 kids sat in silence. She said some words backwards, skipped lines, and had to restart three times. The whole ordeal took nearly five minutes. That would have been humiliating enough, but here's where it gets worse. Some kid named Derek thought this was hilarious. While Riley was struggling, he secretly recorded the whole thing on his phone. By lunch, he posted it on social media with crying, laughing emojis and the caption, when you can't even read like a normal person. By the time school ended, half the seventh grade had seen it. Kids were doing impressions. Of Riley's reading voice in the hallways. I was absolutely furious when Riley showed me the video that night. My hands were shaking as I watched my daughter's worst nightmare playing out on a phone screen. I called the school first thing the next morning, ready to unleash hell. The front office transferred me directly to Miss Williams's classroom phone. I started explaining the situation, my voice getting louder with each sentence. I told her about Riley's diagnosis, her accommodations, the humiliation she'd endured. I was building up to demand she be fired when Miss Williams interrupted me. Ma'am, I am so incredibly sorry, she said quietly. I had no idea about Riley's accommodations. I should have asked her. Genuine remorse caught me off guard, but I was still furious about Derek's video. Well, what are you going to do about the kid? Who
