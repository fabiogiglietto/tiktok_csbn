I was devastated, but tried to understand. The next morning, he came over with his parents. Instead of support, they handed me a folder containing receipts for all the wedding expenses they'd contributed. His mother coldly said, since you're canceling, we expect reimbursement. I was speechless. My fiance couldn't even look me in the eye when he said, I'm sorry, but I didn't sign up for this. I wanted a wife, not a patient. He took his ring back and left. I was completely broken. My parents were furious, but focused on helping me through treatment. My sister postponed her semester abroad to be my caregiver. My friends organised a schedule to drive me to appointments. My workplace gave me flexible hours. Three months into my treatment, I received a text from my ex. He'd met someone new and they were already engaged. He wrote, she's everything I wanted. Healthy, vibrant and drama free. I'm finally getting the life I deserve. I didn't respond.

That was the last time that happened. 2. One time my sister was hiding in my closet to wait for a bit until I was almost asleep so she could scare me. Unfortunately, she didn't know I was whacking it and she jumped out to scare me right as I came, which ended up go going all over her face and into her mouth. My mom heard the commotion and came into my room to investigate and after seeing me naked and my sister covered in my jizz got the wrong idea. Three, I had a closet sized single dorm room and people would always pull the fire alarm in the middle of the night and we'd all have to go outside. One time I was so drowsy I just walked out instinctively and halfway down the hall I raced back. Thankfully this was an old building so I didn't get locked out of the room or not me, but I was spending the night at my friend's house in a suburban neighborhood. In the middle of the night, his mom had let their toy fox terrier out to go pee and it got snatched by a coyote. She screamed and woke us all up. A wolf got noodle. Within 10 seconds his dad was sprinting. Out of the house completely butt ass naked with a Glock in his hand and went running down the street. Came back about 15 minutes later with the dog and obviously still completely naked. 5. I locked myself out of my flat whilst sleepwalking. My girlfriend was on holidays, so I had to wait until morning, borrow a towel off a neighbour and then walk about a mile up the road to the estate agent to get a spare key. 6. Never chased a burglar down the stairs, through the kitchen and out my front door without wearing a shred of clothing and no weapon in hand. The power of nakedness.

My son was diagnosed with a rare heart condition when he was 4. By the time he turned 7, he needed a specialized surgery that only one doctor in Boston could perform. The procedure cost $123,000 and our insurance denied coverage, calling it experimental. We'd already sold our house and moved into a tiny apartment. I was working two jobs while my husband took care of our son, whose condition was deteriorating rapidly. His lips would turn blue during even mild activity and he'd started having fainting spells. Last month, his cardiologist called us in for an emergency appointment. His heart was failing faster than they expected. If he doesn't get this surgery within three weeks, I don't think he couldn't finish the sentence, but we understood we were still $11,000 short. Despite the gofundme and community fundraisers, I picked up a third job at an upscale hotel bar in downtown Chicago, working overnight shifts after my day jobs. I was surviving on two to three hours of sleep, but nothing mattered except getting that money. On my fifth night, I was so exhausted I could barely stand. That's when Keanu Reeves walked in alone around 1 am he was in town filming, according to the local news. He wore simple clothes and looked tired. Sitting at the far end of the empty bar, I recognized him immediately but could see he wanted privacy. I just nodded. And asked, what can I get you? No name, no recognition. He ordered a whiskey neat and asked for the food menu while making his drink, my hands were shaking from exhaustion. I dropped a glass and it.

See, when the police investigated the stolen car, they found something else. My brother had been driving home from his girlfriend's apartment. Except his girlfriend was actually my fiance. They've been seeing each other for eight months behind my back. When I confronted my parents about it, my mom said I needed to forgive and move on. That Wesley was young and made a mistake. That I was being dramatic and ruining family harmony over a man. The man I was supposed to marry in three months. My dad handed me back my engagement ring and told me to return it quietly. Don't make a scene. Don't embarrass Wesley. He's got a future. Law school applications, important things. I returned to the ring. Then I returned myself. Moved four States away. Changed my number, deleted everything. No Thanksgiving invites, no Christmas. Not even a text. When I got diagnosed with Lupus last year and spent two weeks in the hospital alone. But Linda never stopped calling me. She's the one who taught me to drive, helped me move into my first apartment, co signed my student loans when my parents wouldn't. She flew out when I was hospitalized and sat with me every single day. She held my hand when the doctors explained I'd be managing this disease for the rest of my life. So when she asked me to come to her 60th birthday, I said yes. I didn't know was that Linda had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer six months ago. Stage 4. She told me the night before the dinner. Said she had maybe eight months left, probably less. I need you there tomorrow.

My dad stepped forward in the restaurant. Linda, this is inappropriate. Linda set her napkin down slowly. What's inappropriate is pretending my niece doesn't exist because your son can't keep his hands off other people's fiance's. My brother Wesley started toward the door. I'm not staying for this. Good, Linda said, because I'm changing my will next week, and I wanted her here when I told you. The entire restaurant went quiet. The hostess just stood there holding four menus. My mom grabbed my dad's arm. Linda, you can't be serious. I've never been more serious. Sit down or leave. But she stays. They sat. Of course they did. Linda owned three commercial properties downtown and a beach house in Destin. She'd never married, never had kids. My parents had been positioning Wesley as her favorite nephew for years. Linda pulled out an envelope and slid it across the table to me. I already changed it, she said last month. My lawyer has the documents. Everything goes to you. The properties, the accounts, the house. Wesley's face went white. Aunt Linda, I don't understand. I've been visiting you every month. I drove you to your appointments, I. You drove me because your mother told you to. Linda cut him off. You visited because you wanted my money. You never once asked how I was actually feeling. Not once she turned to me. But you. You called me every Sunday for three years, even when your own mother wouldn't speak to you. You flew out when I had my hip surgery and slept on my couch for a week. You sent me flowers on my birthday when these people couldn't even remember the date. My mom stood up. This is manipulation. You're dying, and you're not thinking clearly. We'll contest this. Linda smiled. I hoped you'd say that. My lawyer is also here tonight, two tables behind you. He's been documenting everything. A man in a gray suit raised his wine glass slightly. Wesley knocked his chair over, leaving. My parents followed, my mother already crying. Linda reached across the table and squeezed my hand. Happy birthday to me, she said. We ordered dessert. She had eight months left. I made sure she spent every single one of them loved.

And in this situation, we have to consider your wife. No, she does not find out about this. I'm not risking my marriage over an inconclusive test. I don't think you understand. Your baby's at risk. Shannon needs to know. Dr Halstead, they teach you about doctor patient confidentiality in med school, cause they definitely covered it in law school. I'm your patient, too, now, and I'm telling you to keep your mouth shut. Well, we have to test Shannon. We can't. Not without violating his confidentiality. He refuses to tell her. That's ridiculous. I mean, even if he's HIV positive, we could break confidentiality. Doesn't zika get the same exemption? No. Unfortunately, Zika's so new, there's no legal precedent. But what if they have sex? What if he infects the fetus? I mean, you've seen babies with microcephaly. Natalie, I have spent the last hour trying to find a way around HEPA. I've got nothing. And you'll come after the hospital and my license, incidentally. So you're just giving up. There's nothing we can do. We can't justify breaking the law over an inconclusive test result. I know what you're thinking. Don't do anything. Avoid sexual contact. Why? None of the books say anything about avoiding sex. We're done here. I'm sorry. I. I think, I think there's something you should know, Mr Kim. This is Dr Ellen Hart Epidemic. Intelligence Service officer for the CDC. May I speak to you in private, Mr Kim? No, you can't.

Raspé la fecha del recibo. La raspé hasta dejarla completamente limpia. Luego cambié la fecha con un bolígrafo. Me añadí 10 años de un solo trazo. Después, recorté el nombre del recibo destruido. Lo pegué con cuidado sobre el nombre verdadero. A continuación venía el paso más importante, saqué el modelo de avión que había dejado en remojo. Despejé lentamente el logotipo de la aerolínea. Lo pegué en la esquina del recibo. El cheque falso de la compañía aérea quedó terminado. Cuando fui al banco a cobrarlo, la chica de la ventanilla casi descubrió el engaño. Por suerte, soy guapo, la distraje con palabras dulces. El cheque se cobró sin problemas. Después de saborear el éxito, compré más modelos de avión y hice más cheques con credenciales falsas de piloto y cheques falsos. Cambié una y otra vez dinero en efectivo. Me volví cada vez más audaz. Empecé a viajar en avión gratis. Incluso me sentaba directamente en la cabina, fingiendo ser parte de la tripulación. Desde entonces, solo viajo en los aviones de esa compañía. Cobro cheques en todo el país. Una vez, mientras cobraba, hablé con un empleado del banco. Le saqué información sobre la tecnología antifalsificación de los cheques. Inmediatamente fui a una subasta. Compré una máquina de impresión profesional. La escala se hizo cada vez mayor. Finalmente, atrajo la atención del FBI. Cometí delitos por todo el país. Dejé un montón de pruebas. Menos de un año ya había estafado varios millones de Dólares. Una vez el agente hanrati, siguiendo el rastro de los cheques, encontró mi residencia, pero no tenía ni idea de cómo era yo. Cuando irrumpió en mi habitación, salí tranquilamente del baño y me encontré justo frente a él. No me puse nervioso en absoluto, incluso le expliqué en el acto las herramientas de falsificación. Mi actuación confundió a Jan. Rati pensó que yo también era policía. Le dije a la gente que había llegado tarde, que yo era del servicio secreto y que mi compañero ya había arrestado al sospechoso. El agente me pidió mi identificación sin dudarlo. Saqué mi cartera justo cuando estaba a punto de abrirla. Señalé por la ventana. Le dije que mi compañero y el sospechoso estaban allí, pero en realidad era solo mi vecino. Intercambié unas palabras con el vecino. El agente creyó por completo. Tomé las supuestas pruebas y me marché con Aires de triunfo. El agente aún me gritó desde atrás. Olvidaste tu cartera. Después de que me fui, hanrati recordó abrir la cartera para verificar la identidad y dentro solo había unas pegatinas de dibujos animados.

Después de eso, la mayoría de las armas se atascaban o no expulsaban las vainas. Pero hubo un arma que siguió funcionando sin problema alguno. Era el rifle más famoso del mundo, el ak 47. El hombre que creó esta arma se llamaba kalashniko. Solía conducir un tanque, pero durante una batalla, su tanque fue alcanzado por fuego enemigo y explotó, hiriendo gravemente su brazo. Camino al hospital, notó que los rifles de los soldados no funcionaban bien. Los cargadores se dañaban con el agua y los resortes eran tan débiles que se congelaban con el frío. Armas así podían costar vidas. Fue entonces cuando se le ocurrió la idea de crear su propia arma. Después de recuperarse, volvió a su viejo taller mecánico y dijo que quería construir una arma nueva. Conocía bien las máquinas, así que le dieron un cuarto pequeño. En solo 3 días diseñó el primera k 47. Su mano aún no había sanado del todo, así que pidió ayuda a algunos trabajadores. Juntos, trabajaron duro y construyeron el primera k 47. Ahora era momento de probarlo. Un trabajador tomó el arma y disparó a un tambor. La bala lo atravesó por completo. Luego disparó de nuevo y cada tiro dio justo en el blanco. El poder del arma quedó demostrado. Después de esto, kalashniko fue a la oficina del ejército para que aprobaran el arma. Pero en cuanto el guardia la vio, lo Confundieron con un terrorista y lo detuvieron más tarde. Cuando un oficial probó el arma por sí mismo, quedó impactado. Era mejor que todas las demás, pero según las reglas, el arma solo podía aprobarse si ganaba la competencia anual de tiro. El oficial llamó a un general. El general también probó el arma y quedó muy impresionado. El general le dijo a kalashnikov que participara en la competencia en nombre del ejército. Fue al instituto de armamento en moscú, donde recibió un cuarto propio. Pero en la primera prueba su arma falló y fue rechazada. Se sintió muy decepcionado y empezó a regresar a casa, pero en el camino un oficial lo detuvo. El oficial le dio otra oportunidad para construir una ametralladora. Kalashnikov tomó la oportunidad en serio y trabajó duro.

En su lugar, fui a la habitación de ambos. Vi el dormitorio hecho un desastre. Mi corazón se hundió al instante. Mi esposa no tenía ni idea de que yo ya había vuelto antes de tiempo hasta que cayó el sol. Mi esposa regresó a casa apresuradamente. Cuando me vio, se quedó asombrada y me abrazó nerviosa, preguntándome con preocupación por qué había vuelto antes. No respondí directamente, sino que le pregunté dónde había estado. Al ver que mi esposa seguía mintiendo, decidí darle una última oportunidad, pero ella aún intentaba evadir la verdad. Desenmascaré su secreto, saqué la pistola con determinación y apreté el gatillo sin dudar. El disparo alertó al trabajador de afuera. Corrió a golpear la puerta, preguntando qué había pasado, pero disparé 2 veces más hacia la ventana, asustando al trabajador que huyó de inmediato. Luego disparé una vez más al aire y moví el cuerpo de mi esposa a otra posición. Recogí los casquillos, borré las pruebas y los arrojé de nuevo al suelo. Me quité la ropa y la quemé. Finalmente, me lavé con agua caliente para eliminar toda evidencia del asesinato. Después de completar todo esto, no elegí escapar, sino esperar la llegada de la policía. La policía llegó rápidamente la escena del crimen. Tomé el teléfono con calma y solicité que un oficial llamado Nick entrara a negociar. Este hombre estaba confundido porque él no era un negociador experto. Ambos bajamos nuestras armas. Nick era precisamente el hombre que había tenido una aventura con mi esposa, pero él no me conocía en absoluto. Sabía quién era la mujer en la villa. Hasta que vio las fotos en la pared. No se dio cuenta de que era mi esposa. Corrió rápidamente hacia ella y descubrió que aún respiraba. En ese momento levanté la pistola de nuevo. Nick sintió un escalofrío en la espalda, me quitó la pistola de un golpe y me tiró al suelo. Los demás policías entraron en masa y lograron someterme. La policía comenzó inmediatamente a rescatar a mi esposa. Los ojos de nick estaban llenos de odio y en ese momento, sentado en el coche patrulla, le mostré una sonrisa siniestra. Todo estaba saliendo según mi plan. La policía recopiló pruebas suficientes en la escena. Nick estaba decidido a no dejarme quedar impune. Encontró al fiscal a cargo del caso y entregó mi declaración mientras repetía la situación en la escena, el joven y prometedor fiscal le aseguró que no se preocupara porque en este campo tenía una tasa de condena del 97%.

Is she okay? She's gonna be fine, but run and ask a nurse to call 9 1 1. Thank you. Let me just get. Your shortness of breath could be a sign that clots have broken off and scattered to your lungs. And I have to ask, how long have you been a girl? So the chest CT confirmed that you have pulmonary embolism. You'll have to stay overnight, but the blood thinners are already working. We'll get you back to your dancers as soon as possible. Thank you. You got it. Um, so, Anna, an ER doctor will be coming to do a full exam, including a pelvic. And an admissions officer needs to help clarify your parents health insurance. There is no Anna on their policy. They only list an Abe. Yeah, that's out of date. So you were born a boy? No, The ER doctor won't agree, but I've always been a girl. Gotcha. How long have you been Anna? On and off. Back home since I was little. But everywhere full time starting this year. And the camp? It's been so cool. No one there ever knew me before, so to them, I'm just me. And I was always teased for being too feminine. Do your parents know that you're taking estrogen? My mom tries to be supportive, but she insisted I see a therapist and made me promise not to start hormones until I turn 17 and not to push for surgery yet. But a few months ago, I started taking estrogen behind her back. I talked to your parents. Dad, too. He's worried about you. If it weren't for him, I could have avoided puberty. They have drugs to do that now. But he thought I was too young to decide. Yeah, he mentioned you had some tough times in the past. Self injury. And you were medicated for depression. But since I've been in, I felt fine. I haven't even taken antidepressants for six months. So you think your bad feelings came from living an identity that was false? Yeah. See, until recently, doctors labeled transgender patients as having depression. But the mood often lifts as soon as people are free to be themselves. How'd you know that? I did some reading to keep up with my patients. So did you talk my parents out of flying in? Oh, no. You're not the only stubborn one in your family. They are coming. Great.

Cuando apunté a un antílope. Mi dedo apretó el gatillo accidentalmente y fallé el disparo. El antílope huyó en dirección contraria. No volví a disparar. Como militar, sabía bien que la presa herida no podría huir lejos. Recogí el cartucho del suelo y seguí el rastro de la presa herida. Justo cuando llegué al lugar donde la presa cayó, descubrí una gran cantidad de sangre en el suelo. Esta escena me pareció extraña. Seguí el rastro de sangre en el suelo. Tomé mis binoculares para observar y vi un sabueso herido. Me di cuenta de que había ocurrido un conflicto cerca cerca encontré vehículos sospechosos para investigar la situación. Avancé con cuidado. Descubrí que las personas en el suelo estaban muertas. Evidentemente había habido un fuerte enfrentamiento. Me acerqué a un coche para mirar dentro. Al abrir la puerta, vi que aún había una persona viva. Rápidamente levanté mi escopeta, pero el herido pidió agua. Sin embargo, no llevaba ni una gota de agua. Tomé el arma del herido y me fui. Luego fui a revisar la parte trasera del coche. Inesperadamente descubrí que estaba lleno de mercancía. Sí, y la mercancía aún estaba en el coche. Alguien debía haberse escapado con el dinero y probablemente estaba gravemente herido, pero con este calor abrasador no podría haber ido lejos. Supuse que buscaría sombra. Pronto hice un descubrimiento. Había una figura humana bajo un gran árbol. Adelante, pero no me apresuré a acercarme. Permanecí quieto esperando. Una hora confirmé que el otro no se movía en absoluto. Solo entonces me atreví a acercarme. Lentamente descubrí que había dejado de respirar. Vi una maleta junto al cadáver, incluso abrí la maleta. Dentro había mucho dinero. Comprendí que ese dinero traería peligro, pero no podía dejar escapar este dinero. Tomé la maleta y regresé a casa, pero cuando me acosté por la noche, sentí una extraña inquietud interior, así que llené una cantimplora con agua y regresé de inmediato a la escena del enfrentamiento. Quería darle agua al hombre del coche, pero cuando abrí la puerta descubrí que había sido asesinado. También abandoné cualquier intento de ayudarlo

Well, I'd like to run some tests, do a manual exam, then an ultrasound. Sure. Yeah, anything. I just want to feel better. But do you think I could get something now though for the pain? How about Tylenol? Okay, if you think it'll help. Thousand milligrams of acetaminophen. That's it for this degree of pain. I don't want to hold off on anything stronger for now. Okay. Are they better? What's up? Uh, opioid health, that new AI program that the hospital's testing out to assess a patient's risk of opioid abuse. Yeah, it's one of those new technologies designed to sniff out doctor shoppers. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I Ran my endometriosis patient's name through at Jody Dunnar. She was red flagged. Well, I can see why. It's lengthy prescription history, opioids, benzos, barbiturates. Yeah. Reads like a classic pill seeker given that her primary complaint was back pain. I thought so, too. Now I'm not so sure. Okay. What do you need? Second opinion. The AI program tagged her as high risk, means if it is Endo, I'm locked out of prescribing her meds.

Do you understand? I. I think so. Okay, Jody, Dr. Archer and I are gonna step outside. We'll be right back. Okay, that was not an informed consent. Postictal confusion from the seizure.

Three days later, official inspectors showed up with equipment and plastic suits. They took one look behind that supply cabinet and immediately evacuated our classroom. Turns out there was a pipe leak in the ceiling that had been slowly dripping water into the wall for months. The whole back corner was basically a mold factory. Seven kids had to get blood tests and medical treatment. The school moved our entire class into the library for the rest of the year while they gutted and rebuilt that room. The renovation took four months. When local news came to interview about the mold problem, Missus Patterson told reporters she had no idea there was any issue.

What point that you were upset, but you can't run from problems. I almost laughed. I didn't run from problems. I left a situation where I was punished for self defense. Ashley stepped forward. I'm sorry for what happened. Can we move past this? What are you sorry for? I asked. The fight. Getting you in trouble. What about lying? Destroying my homework, making yourself cry to manipulate dad? Her face went red. Dad pointed at me. That's enough being disrespectful. And you suspended me from my own house for defending myself. Guess we're even. Bobby appeared from his office. I think you folks should leave. They stood there expecting me to break. I just stared back. They left. Ashley turned at the door. You'll regret this. I went back to work. That evening. I graduated high school through the night program, something they didn't even know I transferred to. Bobby, Jake and Tommy came to the ceremony, took a photo of me in my cap and gown next to my truck. My parents never showed. I never invited them. Two months later, Ashley's pregnant at 16. Father's gone. Family calls begging for help. Six months later, dad loses his job, behind on mortgage. More desperate calls. Nine months later, babies born. They're drowning. I bought my first truck. 12 months later, foreclosure notice, $12,000 behind. I had exactly that in savings. I thought about it for three days. That money could save their house, keep them from Being homeless, it would also teach them I'd come running whenever they needed rescuing, that they could treat me like garbage and I'd still be their safety net. I didn't give it to them. They lost the house, moved into a two bedroom rental, four people, one baby. Dad working retail, mom doing data entry. Ashley still living with them, unemployed. Meanwhile, Bobby made me a partner, 20% of the shop at 18. I co owned a business at 20. I bought a house. Last month, dad showed up one final time. No money request, just I was wrong about that day, about suspending you, about all of it. We're proud of what you've built. I didn't know what to say. Part of me wanted to stay angry. I appreciate you saying that. I told him. I know it's late. Yeah, it is. He left. Haven't heard from him since. I got a girlfriend who doesn't care that I'm a mechanic. She likes that I can fix thing. I've never met my niece. Don't plan to. Sometimes Bobby asks if I feel bad. I tell him the truth. I feel free. They chose Ashley over me every single time. Now they're living with that choice and I'm living with mine. The difference, I'm thriving. They're surviving. That's not revenge. That's just reality.

I just said alright. The next morning I was gone and what followed destroyed them all. My dad gave me an ultimatum, apologize to my sister Ashley for assaulting her or stay locked in my room indefinitely. No phone, no leaving except for school and meals. All because she destroyed my calculus homework, 3 hours of work and I physically removed her from my room after she shoved me first. I looked at my ruined papers dripping onto the carpet, looked at Ashley's satisfied smirk behind my dad said two words, alright. He thought I caved. I packed that night. By 6 a. M. I was at my Uncle Bobby's house with three $400 in cash I'd saved from my hardware store job. Bobby's my dad's younger brother, but they're nothing alike. Dad wears suits and works insurance. Bobby owns an auto shop and never looked down on me once. He didn't ask questions, just poured me coffee and said you can stay but you're gonna work. Started Monday at his auto shop. Minimum wage, oil changes, learning real skills, no golden child treatment, no punishments for things I didn't do, just work for pay. The double standards at home had been obvious for years. Ashley got new clothes every season while I wore hand me downs. She had no curfew. Mine was nine PM her room was private. Mine fair game for anyone when servers At restaurants would comment on the favoritism. My parents didn't even deny it. My family couldn't reach me. Dad had my phone. When mom finally got through to Bobby's landline demanding I come home, he said, kid made his choice. So did you. Then hung up. Four months in, they showed up at the shop. I was under a Honda covered in grease. Dad in his business casual, Ashley in designer clothes I'd never seen before. We want you home, mom said. You've made your point. I.

Girls, not in front of the kids. Lauren stormed inside. Twenty minutes later, I heard her in the kitchen on the phone, voice shaky like she was crying. Maybe someone should check if her house is even safe for children. By that night, the family group chat was a war zone. Lauren had typed out a list of since I was apparently an unfit mother. My daughter had lice last spring. My 12 year old walks to the corner store alone. We have a trampoline. I let them watch superhero movies. She he ended it with, I'm a mandated reporter. I don't wanna do this. But if you ever criticize my parenting again, I'll have to file a report. I sat in my car reading it, heart pounding. One phone call from her and social workers show up at my door, interview my kids at school, dig through my house. All because I asked her boys to go outside. My mom texted me privately, just apologize and keep the peace. My brother sent a popcorn emoji. Nobody defended me. I didn't sleep that night. Two weeks later was my son's birthday party. Everyone acted like nothing happened. Lauren walked in with her boys wearing Headphones, tablets strapped to their chests. They didn't say happy birthday, didn't acknowledge anyone, just found a corner and plugged in. 10 minutes into the party, the eight year old started screaming. Full meltdown, kicking furniture, throwing things, tears streaming down his face. The Wi-Fi was too slow. That was the crisis. Lauren didn't correct him, didn't take him aside, just handed him her phone with a different game. Here, baby, this one works offline. I watched my parent.

My crime, asking her kids to play outside. My sister Lauren and I were always close. Same town, kids, the same ages, Sunday dinners at our parents house every week. Her boys were 8 and 10. My daughter and son were 9 and 11. Perfect cousin squad. At least it used to be. Somewhere along the way, Lauren's boys became iPad kids, not normal screen time every waking moment. Breakfast in the car with ipads propped on the dashboard. Dinner at restaurants with headphones in and eyes glazed. I once saw them at the pool with their tablets and ziplock bags so they wouldn't get wet while they floated. Lauren worked long shifts as a nurse, so I never said anything. Single mom, crazy hours, do what you have to do. I kept my mouth shut for years. Then came Labor Day weekend, big backyard cookout at my parents place, burgers on the grill, kids running through the sprinkler, lawn games everywhere. Summer at its best, except Lauren's boys were inside on the couch, volume blasting, playing video games. Since 9 that morning, my daughter tried to get them outside for a water balloon fight. Nothing. My son offered to show them his skateboard, ignored. They wouldn't even look up. I finally walked in and paused both screens. Hey, guys, let's take a break. Go outside for a bit. Lauren appeared out of nowhere. Seriously, they've been on those since this Morning. They're missing everything. She grabbed the ipads back. They're happy. They're quiet. Mind your business.

I answered and she immediately started yelling that I stole her son from his family, that I trapped him with a baby, that Danny cried through half the reception because her brother wasn't there.

Tuesday and Friday are trash days in our neighborhood, but he does it every day because she keeps forgetting which days they come. But here's the thing that really got me. That's not all he does. He also checks her mailbox and brings it inside for her. Sometimes she leaves a little note taped to her front door, and he'll go inside and help her reach things on high shelves or change a light bulb or reset her router when the internet stops working. One time, I saw him programming her TV remote because she couldn't figure out how to switch inputs. The whole routine takes about 10 to 15 minutes, depending on what she needs. That day I noticed he started keeping a small toolbox in his trunk around the same time. Now I know why. There's also a package of batteries, light bulbs, and even a step stool back there. Yesterday I finally asked him about it. I tried to be casual, like, hey, I saw you helping Mrs. Girl the other day. That's really sweet. She just shrugged and said her son lives three states away and someone should make sure she's okay, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. I pushed a little More because I wanted to understand why he never mentioned it. That's when he told me the real reason. His grandma lived alone in Ohio for six years before she passed away when he was 19. He said his family visited when they could, but they lived four hours away and his parents both worked full time. She'd call sometimes saying she couldn't open a jar.

Later that night, we were all in the living room. Kevin and I were on the couch. Ace and Diana were across from us. His parents were in their recliners working on their second bottle of wine. That's when his mom said it, the thing that made me snap. Jace, why don't you sneak into their bedroom tonight? She giggled. I bet she won't even notice. Just to see I Stood up. My whole body was shaking. Stop the.

So I erupted and the twins backed me up. I met my husband Kevin through his identical twin Jace at a mutual friend's wedding five years ago. Jace and I were seated at the same table and we hit it off immediately. When he found out I was into vintage cars, he said you have to meet my brother. He restores classics. Then showed up an hour later covered in grease from working on a 67 Mustang. We talked for three hours straight. Jace just smiled the whole time, clearly proud of his matchmaking skills. Four years later, Kevin and I got married. Jace was the best man. Everything was perfect until the rehearsal dinner. That's when it started. Kevin's mom stood up to give a toast and halfway through she looked at Jason said, you know, you could just switch places tomorrow and she'd never know the difference. The room laughed nervously. I forced to smile. Kevin squeezed my hand under the table so hard it hurt. I thought it was a one time thing, wedding jitters maybe, but it wasn't. At our first Christmas as a married couple, his dad cornered Jason in the kitchen and while I was grabbing wine, you should sneak into their room tonight, he said loud enough for me to hear. Let's see if she notices. Jace's face went red. He told His dad to stop. His dad just laughed and walked away. Every family gathering, same joke. Easter dinner, his mom said, Jace, sit next to her, see if she realizes it's not Kevin.

My boyfriend Tanner has this weird habit of leaving for work exactly 17 minutes earlier than he needs to every single day, 6:43 on the dot. His alarm goes off at 6:15. He's dressed by 6:30 and then he's out the door. I thought maybe he just liked beating traffic or stopping for coffee on the way. But his office is literally eight minutes away and he brings coffee from home in his thermos. Didn't add up. We've been living together for two years and this started about four months ago when he switched to the morning shift. I never questioned it because honestly I'm not a morning person. I'm usually half asleep when he kisses my forehead and leaves. But this morning I had insomnia and couldn't sleep at all. So I was wide awake when he went through his usual routine. I watched him grab his keys, check his phone, kiss my forehead like always and head out the door. That's when I noticed something strange. Through our bedroom window, instead of getting in his car, he walked directly to our neighbor's house two doors down, Missus Earl's house. Missus Earl is this tiny 80 year old woman who's lived on our street for like 30 years. Her husband died last February and I remember seeing her at the funeral looking absolutely lost. Since then she's been living alone. Her son lives in Oregon and she doesn't have any other Family nearby. I got curious and honestly a little concerned. So last week, I actually set my alarm early and followed him.

I'm in the kitchen grabbing more drinks from the garage fridge when my mother in law and sister in law walk in speaking Korean. They don't see me behind the open pantry door. He's getting fat.

But then my mother in law says something that makes my blood run cold. I'm changing my will next week. Mira deserves the inheritance, not him. I've talked to my lawyer. There's a way to structure it so her husband can't touch a single penny. Even if they stay married, it all goes to her and the kids only. My sister in law laughs, mom, you're brilliant. He's been mooching long enough. For context, I'm a civil engineer. I make 140 k a Year. We split all expenses equally. I've never asked them for a single dollar. I stepped out from behind the pantry door. My mother in law is mid sentence when she sees me. Her eyes go wide. In perfect Korean, I said, I've understood every single word you've said about me for 25 years, every insult.

I heard what you said the night we got engaged about the grandchildren looking Korean. I heard you tell your friends at our anniversary that you were waiting for Mira to leave me. I heard every single thing. My sister in law dropped her wine glass. It shattered on the tile, red wine spreading everywhere. But neither of them moved, just stared at me like I'd grown a second head. I switched back to English, my voice completely calm. I'll be telling Mira everything tonight, every single thing you've said about me over 25 years, about her choices, about our kids, about your plans to cut me out of your will like I'm some kind of gold digger. My mother in law finally found her voice, but it came out as a whisper. Mira doesn't need to know about, about what I interrupted, about how her own mother has spent two and a/2 decades disrespecting her husband in a language she thought I couldn't understand, about how you've been planning to manipulate your inheritance to make sure I know my place behind them.

He'd already rented a two bedroom apartment downtown first and last month pay. He wanted to do things the right way. He said divorce first then move her in after a few months so the kids could adjust. I remember looking at him and just laughing. Not a cruel laugh, just genuine surprise at how stupid he was being. He got defensive immediately asked me why I wasn't crying or screaming, said he expected me to at least care that our marriage was ending. I told him I'd need two weeks to tell the kids and find a lawyer. He seemed relieved, even thanked me for being mature about it. What Matthew didn't know was that Jenna had reached out to me three weeks earlier. She'd sent me a long message on Instagram apologizing for everything, said she didn't know we were still together, that Matthew had told her we were basically roommates going through a slow separation, that I was cold, old and emotionally distant, that he'd been unhappy for years. And was only staying for the kids. She seemed genuinely upset and sent me screenshots of their conversations, hundreds of texts where he complained about me, said I'd let myself go, that I didn't understand his ambitions.

That's what it means to love someone. He just needs time to figure things out, to feel better without her, mom told me. Well, how long does that take? I asked nicely. She smiled and pulled me into a hug. Maybe weeks, maybe months, maybe even years. But he'll feel better eventually, she said. Years. But I wanted him to feel better right away. That's when I came up with an idea. That weekend, while my uncle took Grandpa out to grab groceries, I went to the house with my parents and aunt. They helped clean up the house and set up the dining table while I got to work in the kitchen. Pulled out Grandma's recipe box and found the card for her pot roast, Grandpa's favorite. I use the same cast iron pot she always used. I cut the vegetables the same way, even burn the onions a little the same way she did. Takes like this, add to the flavor, she'd always say. Her instructions, her laugh, everything was still fresh in my head. Grandma, if you're there, help Grandpa, smile, I whispered as I added the final touches.

His hands started to shake. His eyes scanned the clean living room, then landed on the dining table that was set with grandma's favorite ceramic plates, surrounded by his children and grandchildren. Grandpa, welcome home. Time to eat, the youngest cousin shouted. His lip trembled, but he still didn't speak. He just stood there, tears falling. My mom guided him to his chair at the head of the table. While I served everyone the way grandma used to. Mom pulled out her phone and took pictures of the pot roast with the whole family before we ate. Grandpa ate quietly, crying with bite. After dinner, he stepped into the kitchen to help me wash the dishes. We stood side by side at the sink, awkwardly silent. Then he started talking about how he fell in love with grandma because she was the kindest person he'd met, that he loved how she always had food waiting for him after 12 hour shifts at the factory, even when she was exhausted caring for five kids herself. Then he said something I never expected. I, I used to watch you and grandma cook together from the hallway. I always wished I could join, but I didn't wanna ruin it. She was the one with the cooking gift and you got It from her. I've never been more proud of having a gentle hearted grandson. I cried then. I mean, who wouldn't? I started coming over every weekend after that, taught him how to make all her recipes. And for three years we cooked together until he followed grandma to heaven, too.

While I couldn't throw a ball to save my life and my grades were average at best, the only thing I was ever good at was cooking, Grandpa made it clear that wasn't something to be proud of. He'd walk past the kitchen while I helped my grandma and mutter something under his breath. That's women's work, he told my dad once. Too girly for a growing boy. It hurt because I really loved it. I ended up just avoiding him and spending all my time in the kitchen with grandma, learning her recipes, watching her dance around the kitchen. I may have never really fit in with the family, but in that kitchen, she never made me feel like that at all. But when I turned 13, she passed suddenly and quickly, like a strike of lightning. One day she was laughing at my terrible knife skills and the next day she was gone, fell asleep and just never woke up. My family was devastated, but my grandpa seemed unfazed. He didn't cry at the funeral. He just went about his day like normal, working the field and garden, reading. The newspaper when people brought her up, he just shrug or walk.

Sunday, April 2nd, 2,017. I remember the exact date because it's when my life split into before and after. Started normal quick workout that morning, then out to run errands, oil changes for both cars, my girlfriend's first and mine. I'm sitting in the waiting room with my car getting serviced, watching some YouTube video on my phone. Then happened. This headache hit me. Not gradual, instant, like someone shoved an ice pick behind my right eye and dragged it straight through to the back of my skull. I froze. The pain was unrelenting but not unbearable. I've never had a migraine before, so I figured that's what this was. People get migraines, just push through it. When they finished, I texted my girlfriend. Got a bad headache, heading back to sleep it off. Got to her house, popped 2 ibuprofen and crashed. Woke up hours later with the sun setting. My head still felt like it was in a vice. I told myself I'd sleep it off overnight. Monday morning I woke up feeling terrible. Same pressure behind my eye, same pain shooting through my skull. I work construction. Zero chance I could operate machinery feeling like this. Called in sick for the first time in months. My girlfriend came in around 10:00am. We should go to the er. I just need more rest. It's probably a really bad migraine. You've been sleeping for 24 hours then I need 25. She didn't look convinced but let it go. The only relief I found was cycling between painkillers and napping. Every time I woke up, the pain was still there. Tuesday morning, same symptoms, no improvement. My girlfriend walked in holding her car keys. We're going to the hospital. I'm not asking. Come on. I just need. You've had the same headache for 3 days. Get dressed. Basically dragged me to the car. Looking back, she saved my life. At the E R, I told the nurse my symptoms, then added, I also have a bad phobia of needles. I don't do IVs. They sent me for a CT scan without contrast because I refused the IV. I laid there thinking this was overkill for a headache. Back in the room, waiting for results, my girlfriend held my hand. Neither of us said much. I saw my doctor jogging down the hallway. Doctors don't jog unless something's very wrong. He flew into the room out of breath. Hey, listen, man, you've had a stroke. Pretty major bleed in your brain right now. I need to.

I didn't even think. I just reacted. Hey, Avery, I forgot to tell you something important about the wedding. Everyone looked at me. My best friend Kelsey is my maid of honor, and she's wearing a suit. Like, a full tailored suit with pants. I told all my bridesmaids they can wear whatever they want as long as it's in our wedding colour, which is dark green. Avery's head snapped up. Really? Yeah, absolutely. Hold on. I pulled out my phone and opened the folder where Kelsey had sent me outfit ideas. I scooted closer to Avery on the couch and started showing her photos. A green jumpsuit, wide leg pants with a nice blouse. A blazer and trouser combo. A tuxedo jacket with tailored slacks. You can pick any of these. Or honestly, if you want to wear jeans and a green sweater, that works too. It's a wedding, not a runway show. I just want everyone comfortable and having fun. Avery's whole face changed. She actually smiled. You're serious? Completely serious. You could wear sneakers if you want. I don't care. The room went dead quiet. Monica's expression turned into stone. Jason's mom cleared her throat and changed the subject to the cake flavors. Greg just stared at his coffee mug. After they left, Jason pulled me aside. That was really kind of you. He Kissed my forehead. Monica's probably going to be upset, though. He was right. Two days later, Jason got a call from Greg. Monica wanted me to make all the bridesmaids wear matching dresses so Avery wouldn't have a choice. She said it would look uncoordinated in photos if everyone wore different things. She said Avery needed to learn to be more feminine, and this was a good opportunity. Jason told them no. He said it was our wedding and we'd already decided on the dress code. I tried arguing, but Jason shut it down fast. Yesterday, Avery sent me a message on Instagram. It was a screenshot of a dark green suit she found online with the caption, is this okay? I wrote back immediately. That's perfect. You're going to look awesome. She sent back three heart emojis, then another message. Thank you for letting me be myself.

I'm getting married next summer. When Jason proposed, I thought it would be nice to ask his niece Avery to be a bridesmaid. She's 15 and the only kid on either side of our families. We'd only met twice before, but she seemed pretty cool and I figured it might help us get to know each other better. Fast forward to three weeks ago. We drove to Jason's hometown to visit his family and talk wedding stuff. His brother Greg, Greg's wife Monica, and Avery came over to his parents house. Second I saw Avery, I noticed something different. She was wearing baggy cargo pants, an oversized hoodie, and her hair was pulled back in a messy bun. Way more casual than the last time I'd seen her in a floral sundress. We sat in the living room drinking coffee, and Jason's mom brought out wedding magazines. She started flipping through pages of bridesmaid dresses, pointing at the puffy ones and the sparkly ones. Avery shifted in her seat. Her shoulders got tense. She stopped making eye contact with anyone. Monica noticed. Oh, we'll have to take you shopping soon, honey. Get you something pretty and feminine for once. She laughed like it was a joke, but Avery's face went red. Jason's mom chimed in, yes, and maybe we can do something with your hair. A nice updo would look so lovely. Greg nodded. It'll be good for you to dress up. You're at that age where you should be presenting yourself better. I watched Avery sink deeper into the couch. She pulled her hoodie sleeves over her hands. Then Monica said, it'll be nice to see you dressed like a girl for once. My stomach dropped. I was a total tomboy growing up. Hated dresses, hated makeup. My aunt used to say things exactly like that to me at every family gathering, and it crushed me every single time.

Life tried to fry a Turkey inside and started a grease fire that destroyed half the kitchen. Two of the kids got burned badly enough to need emergency care, but nobody could find the insurance cards because I was always the one who kept track of that stuff. Donovan and Nico got into a fistfight over something stupid and Nico broke his hand on Donovan's face. My mother had a panic attack and locked herself in the bathroom for two hours while six children ran around a smoke filled apartment screaming. Vera's husband begged me to come help. I said, they told me I was controlling. They said it would be a relief when I stepped back. Let them handle it. The next day my mother called me sobbing. She said, I'm sorry. I know I wasn't there when you were growing up. I know you raised them. I've always known and I let them believe otherwise because it was easier than admitting what I did to you. I said what you did was steal my childhood and then let them blame me for surviving it. Every single one of my siblings has apologized. I've accepted some of them and I'm still thinking about the others. I will never be the family caretaker. Again.

I do all of this while working 60 hours a week and they don't think I'm the difficult one. I put down my fork and said, grateful for what exactly Donovan said for mom keeping this family together. I said, mom didn't keep this family together. I did. I've been keeping it together since I was 11 years old. My mother started crying immediately. Life said, see, this is what you do. You always make mom feel bad. Vera said, you act like a martyr, but you chose to be controlling. Nico said, we all had it hard. You're not special. I looked at every single one of them. I said, fine, you think I'm controlling? I'm done. No more holidays, no more babysitting, no more money, no more fixing your problems. Handle it yourself.

My mother stood up at Thanksgiving and gave a toast about how she sacrificed everything to raise five children on her own. My siblings all raised their glasses. My brother Donovan looked at me and said, you could at least pretend to appreciate our mother for once. I looked around the table at my four siblings and wondered if any of them actually remembered our childhood. I was 11 years old when I became a mother to four children. My father left, and my mother checked out completely. She'd stay in her bedroom for days at a time, and I'd slide food under her door, hoping she'd eat. I Learned to forge her signature in sixth grade because she wouldn't get out of bed to sign permission slips. I worked at a grocery store at 15 and lied about my age so I could buy food when her disability checks ran. Now I got a full scholarship to a college three hours away and turned it down because I couldn't leave my siblings alone with her. I missed my own prom because my youngest brother had pneumonia and no one else was going to take him to the emergency room. I raised four children before I turned 18, and none of them remember. They remember mom being sad. They remember mom being tired. They don't remember that I was the one who made sure they ate and bathed and Got to school and had clean. They don't remember me staying up until two in the morning helping with homework while mom slept in the next room. They don't remember me walking three miles to the pharmacy when Vera had an ear infection because mom wouldn't get out of bed and we didn't have a car. Now we're all adults, and I'm still doing it. I coordinate every holiday and every birthday. I babysit all nine of their kids on a rotating schedule that I manage. I covered Donovan's mortgage.

He yelled at Nick for going along with your father's stupid pranks and called me immature and manipulative. I tried explaining that I just wanted her to see that she eats way more than she thinks she does. Maybe we could just order her own fries and avoid this whole thing. She refused to watch the video, just kept yelling about the principle of it, how we ambushed her, how it was a betrayal of trust.

I explain the whole plan after we get the food. Take out his stuff, take my burger and give it to me. Hold on to my nuggets in the backseat, but leave just my fries in the McDonald's bag. Put the bag on the center console and secretly record it with his phone from the back seat. I tell him I'm not gonna touch that bag once. I bet you 20 bucks your mom eats every single fry. Nick thinks this is hilarious and agrees immediately. We get back to the car, Rachel comes out of the bathroom and we hit the road. Everything goes exactly as planned. Nick sets up his phone so it's recording the bag. I'm eating my burger, making normal conversation about her parents and whatever. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Rachel's hand go into the bag and again a few minutes later. Then again, I finish my burger, ask Nick to pass me my nuggets from the back, eat those while we're talking about Nick's soccer tryouts coming up. The whole time, Rachel's hand keeps dipping into that bag. She not even paying attention, just reaching in, grabbing fries, eating them while she's talking. At one point, she grabs Like five fries at once. Finally, maybe 20 minutes later, she starts gathering up the garbage. She grabs the McDonald's bag and starts cramming.

I'm doing laundry in my sports bra again because my dryer broke and I'm sweating buckets. I glance out my window and catch Kelly's husband straight up standing at his window with binoculars. Binoculars? I grab my phone and take a picture immediately. Then I march right over to their house and knock hard. Kelly answers, looking annoyed. I show her the picture and say, this is what you should be worried about, not my clothes. Her mouth drops open. She tries to say something, but I'm already walking away. I hear them screaming at each other inside their house. Loud enough that old Mister Carter across the street comes out to see what's happening. Next morning, there's an apology note in my mailbox from Kelly. Very short. Says she's sorry for bothering me and they're working on things. Never wrote back. A month later, I see a moving truck at their house. Kelly's packing boxes by herself, no husband anywhere. She catches me looking and just gives this tiny wave. I wave back.

He called me saying she needed to be part of the ceremony as the sister of the groom. I told her we weren't even having a wedding party, just witnesses to sign the papers. That wasn't good enough. She said she should walk down the aisle before Amy, carrying flowers. I explained there was no aisle at City Hall, but she kept insisting. Then she said if Amy's sister got to be there, she should get a special role, too. My parents backed her up completely. They

She takes care of us really good. She helped me with my science project, and she braids my hair for school. Rachel stepped forward, tears already streaming. She placed her flowers next to theirs. I never thought I'd love again after Michael died, she said quietly. But your husband and your daughters brought light back into my life. I promise I'll take care of them. I'll never try to replace you. They'll always know how much you love them. That's when Mia pulled a folded paper from her jacket. A drawing. Sarah on one side, Rachel on the other, both holding her and Lily's hands, hearts floating above all four of them. I drew us as a family, she said, her voice cracking. Is that okay? I lost it. Rachel wrapped her arms around both girls. Lily looked up at me with Sarah's exact eyes and said, Mama's not mad, daddy. I dreamed about her last night. She said she sent Rachel to take care of us because she can't be here. I touched Sarah's name carved in the stone. The grief would never fully leave, I knew that.

Lily placed one more flower on the grave. Thank you for sending her to us, I whispered.

I came home from work and found her standing in front of the thermostat just staring at it. She had her phone out, calculator app open, utility Bill pulled up on the screen. My stomach dropped. She didn't turn around when I walked in. We need to talk about something. I tried playing dumb. What's up? The AC's been running constantly for 4 months straight. Even during that cold snap in February when it was 45 degrees outside. She finally looked at me. At first I thought it was broken, called the repair guy, spent 100, $50 on a diagnostic. He said it's working perfectly fine. I didn't know what to say. She pulled up a spreadsheet on her phone. So I started tracking it. Every night around eleven PM, the temperature drops to six, 44 degrees. Stays there until about 6 a. M. Then goes back to normal. I can explain you've been freezing yourself every single night.

I started going through old emails on the family computer. My mom had been researching single car accidents, break line failures and something called widows benefits for the past six months. Thursday morning, I went to my dad's office and told him everything I'd found. He didn't believe me at first, but then I showed him the search history, the messages I'd screenshotted. We went to the police. They said they couldn't do anything based on internet searches and text messages. Lots of people research morbid things. Doesn't mean they're planning murder. But my dad was scared. He stayed at a hotel Thursday night instead of going home. I stayed with my best friend, Sarah. At 2 a. M, my phone rang. It was my mom. Where's your father? Her voice was shaking. He was supposed to be home hours ago. He's safe, I said. Away from you. The line went silent. Then she said something that made my blood freeze. You don't understand what you've done. Marcus needed that money. We're in debt to some very dangerous people. She hung up. Friday morning, my dad and I went back to the police with the recording of that call. This time they listened. They told us to stay. Away from the house while they investigated. Six hours later, they called. They'd found Marcus at our house with bags of my dad's clothes, staged a car in the garage. The car was running. He'd been planning to make it look like my dad had taken his own life. My mom was arrested as an accessory. Turns out Marcus had a gambling problem and owed over $300,000 to loan sharks. The life insurance policy was for $500,000. They'd plan the whole divorce as a cover story. I'm 18 now, living with my dad in a new city. My mom took a plea deal and got seven years. Marcus got 15. The house sold last month. My dad split the money with me for college. I haven't spoken to my mom since the trial. She sends letters sometimes, but I don't open them.

When did you actually find out about Marcus? He was silent for a long time. Then he pulled out his phone and showed me a text. Red. My mom had been planning to leave for over a year. The messages went back to when I was 16. But it got worse. There was a message from my mom to Marcus that, just need to wait until the life insurance policy matures in November. Then we can be together. My blood went cold. Dad, what life insurance policy? His face went pale. I took one out three years ago. Your mom's the beneficiary. It matures next week.

I thought I could handle it. To do the bare minimum of my job, I was at school from 6:00am to nine PM every weekday. Then I spent my entire week and planning lessons and grading. I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating right. I was drowning. When my first evaluation came, I expected to be torn apart. Instead, my principal gave me all satisfactory marks. I was confused, but relieved. I didn't realize she was setting me up. A few more weeks passed, and I couldn't take it anymore. I contacted the union and explained everything. The class sizes, the impossible schedule, the lack of support. They said they'd handle it. Nothing changed. By Thanksgiving, I was completely burnt out. But I had two days off for the break.

The husband raised an eyebrow. What school do you work at? I told him, I didn't think twice about it. That Monday morning at 805:00am, my principal came storming into my classroom. Her face was right red. Her hands were shaking. She slammed the door so hard, the windows rattled. You talk to someone about this school? Well, about me. I'm going to have you fired. I'm going to make sure you never work in education again. You're done. I just stared at her, completely frozen. Then my phone buzzed. It was an email from the district office asking me to come in during my lunch break. Turns out the guy I talked to at Thanksgiving wasn't just some random person. He was a district superintendent. He'd filed a formal complaint that morning about unsafe working conditions, contract violations, and administrative retaliation. By 10:00am, my principal was being escorted out of the building by security. By noon, I had an educational assistant assigned to my classroom. By the end of the week, my schedule was completely redone. With proper planning time.

Last week of school, I get called in. My daughter's 16. It's June, and we'd barely survive the year between her depression and me working two jobs. Every day felt like a tightrope. I show up the next morning, second to last day, the dean slides a folder across her desk. We have a serious problem. Your daughter has missed 102 math classes this year. I blinked. Starting in October. Let me get this straight. My daughter missed over 100 math classes, and you're telling me this now, when tomorrow is the last day? The dean shuffled papers, avoiding eye contact. We've been trying to reach you. No, stop. I never got a call, not one letter, not an email. So let's rephrase this. Brought me here to cover your ass. Because nobody, not the teacher, not attendance, not you, said a word about my daughter being missing every day for 8 months. Sadine's face went red. Let's bring your daughter in. My daughter walked in scared and sat next to me. I kept my eyes on the dean first. I just found out you have 102 absences. I turned to her. Why didn't you go? She glanced at the dean nervously. Because the teacher hates me. When I asked questions, she'd yell at me in front of everyone for wasting her time. She called me slow once, so I stopped going. My Heart broke, but I stayed calm. And then what? I wanted to see how long it would take someone to notice. I sat in the library during math every day. Nobody ever checked. The dean shifted uncomfortably. Well, we're checking now. October, I said. My daughter stopped going in October. That's October, November, December, January, February, March, April, May. Eight months. Nobody noticed. Silence was deafening. So what do you want now? The dean cleared her throat. Well, given that tomorrow is the last day, we can't punish her with attention. we think you should cancel her student ambassador trip to Australia. My daughter's face went white. Mom, no. The trip leaving next Monday. The one where she needed good grades, a teacher recommendation and a letter from you personally. I pulled out my phone. The trip I just paid three 200 dollars for. That's non refundable. Her confidence way. I can call the program and explain. You wrote her recommendation in January. I stared at her. You praised her academic excellence in January, four months after she stopped attending math. If you were doing your job, you never would have written that letter. I didn't realize. You didn't realize because you didn't check. I turned to my daughter. You're still

What insane behind the scenes drama did you have to hide from students? My first teaching job was at a Title 1 elementary school as an art teacher. I was 25, fresh out of college, and so excited I couldn't sleep the week before school started. That excitement died pretty fast. A week before classes began, I emailed the principal asking about my keys and badge so I could prep my classroom. No response. I called the office. Nothing. I waited 3 days and finally contacted the district office directly. Two days before school started, I got an angry email from my principal saying I should have been more patient and that going to the district was inappropriate. She made me wait until the day before classes to get my keys. When I finally opened my classroom door, I froze. The room was completely packed with storage desks stacked to the ceiling, 100 chairs piled on top of each other, filing cabinets blocking the windows. I had less than 24 hours to make this functional. I worked until midnight clearing it out. The first day of school, I still didn't have a schedule. I had no idea which classes I was teaching or when. I emailed my principal at 7:00am asking for it. She replied twenty minutes later, accusing me of pressuring and bullying her. I apologized and asked again. She sent the schedule 10 minutes after the first bell rang. That's when I saw it. I had two Classes scheduled at the same time. 46 kids in one room by myself. I also had seven 45 minute periods with no breaks except a 30 minute lunch. I was teaching every grade every single day of the week. There was no time to prep between classes, no time to set up materials, no time to even breathe. I went to my principal's office during lunch and asked if we could adjust the schedule. I explained I was losing instruction time because I had to scramble to get supplies ready while the next class was walking in. She came to my classroom that afternoon while students were waiting in the hallway. She didn't even lower her voice. You're a first year teacher. You don't know what you need. Deal with it or quit. I decided not to quit. Instead, I read the entire district teacher contract that night. There was a section about classroom size. Any class over 30 students is required to have

Emily in the center, furiously tapping her phone. Her friends glancing at watches, looking impatient. Then she pulled some guy forward. He crouched with a lock pick kit and started trying to break in. Mister Williams door swung open. He stepped into the hallway, arms crossed, watching in silence. He had already called the police when he noticed the lock picking. Ten minutes later, the police arrived. I watched on camera as two officers approached. Emily's face went pale. The guy quickly shoved the lock picks away. The officers pointed toward the exit. Emily's guests shuffled away. Bradley glanced over. Already? I showed him the feed. He laughed. Natural consequences. I smirked. Exactly. The next day, my phone exploded. You were beyond out of line. My friends saw everything. We had to take the cake to a random cafe. Then mom called. Emily cried all night. I took a breath. Mom? I told Emily no from the start. She ignored me and planned everything anyway. But you should have warned her. Did Emily tell you about last year? Neighbors complained. Police almost called. I spent a week cleaning up beer and broken dishes. Silence! I'm not doing that again. The family group chat exploded. How could you do this to your sister? You should be more understanding. That's harsh. She's family. I typed. I said no from the start. Emily ignored me. Last year, my house turned into a nightclub. Neighbors complained. Fish is Broken beer everywhere. Yet I'm the bad guy. Some went quiet, others kept going. You should be the bigger person. Publicly humiliating your sister. That's cold. I stared at the screen, exhausted. Then I pressed and held the chat name and hit leave group. Anna has left the group. I set my phone down. No more messages. No more judgment. When we returned home, Emily showed up within minutes. I can't believe you did that to me. I leaned against the counter, calm. Are you here to yell? Do you know how humiliated I was? I shrugged. I told you no from the start. You chose not to listen. She froze. Realizing she had no excuse, she scowled. You never know how to go with the flow. I smiled. And that's why I don't clean up after your parties anymore. She stormed out. Emily stopped texting, stopped calling, avoided family gatherings completely. And honestly, I enjoy the silence.

When I refused, she invited guests anyway. So I booked a flight, locked the house, and taught her a lesson she'd never forget. Emily burst into my kitchen on a quiet Saturday morning, face glowing. I'm throwing my birthday party here. I already told everyone this weekend. I nearly dropped my coffee. Wait, what? She flipped her hair. Your place is spacious. The garden is gorgeous. I've already invited everyone. I crossed my arms. You never asked us. She waved dismissively. You can't say no. I've already ordered the cake, booked a DJ. You'd embarrass me if you cancel. How can I cancel something I never agreed to? She rolled her eyes. Saturday at seven PM. Then she left, texting furiously. Last year, Emily begged me to host her small gathering. I trusted her. What she promised would be ten close friends turned into 30 people. EDM blasting, beer pong on my dining table, shattered dishes, a guy smoking shisha in my living room. By nine PM, my neighbor knocked. Music is deafening. The whole building can hear it. When I cut the music and kicked everyone out, Emily looked at me like I'd ruined her life. But when I saw the beer soaked carpets, smoke, stench, broken plates, I swore she'd never host another party here again. Next morning, I woke to a text from mom. I'm so excited about Emily's party at your place. Emily? Had told the entire family without my permission. I opened the family group chat. Emily's message. This weekend is going to be amazing. Anna and Bradley's place is perfect. Bradley read over my shoulder and sighed. So what's the plan? I smiled. Just wait and see. For four days I stayed silent. Emily kept posting. Got the cake. We're having a DJ. Dress code white and gold. Meanwhile, I booked 2 plane tickets to the Maldives. We were leaving Saturday morning, one day before her party. Before we left, I stopped by my neighbor, Mister Williams apartment. We'll be away for a few days. If anyone causes trouble, especially my sister, please call the police. He raised an eyebrow, amused. Got it all planned out, huh? I don't make the same mistake twice. The night of Emily's party, I was on a beach in the Maldives, cocktail in hand. My phone started vibrating. Where are you? The door is locked. Open the door! Everyone's waiting. Are you kidding me? I opened my security camera app. On screen, fifth

The only challenging part of this exam was trying to balance the desire to finish quickly with the urge to stop and smell my freshly sharpened pencil. Hmm, only one question left. All I needed to do was solve Schrodinger's equation in a cylindrical well by employing the zeros of the bezel function, which of course were. Wait, what are they? Oh, dear. Alright, Sheldon, time to turn in your test. I'm not done yet. I know you like to add your own better questions at the end, but for the last time, I don't count them. I just need a few more minutes on this problem. That's an easy one. Just apply the zeros of the vessel function. I can't remember what the zeros of the vessel function are. You didn't memorize them. Of course I did. Then what's the problem? I'm blinking. Sorry, son. Class is over. No, I can do this. It's just one question. You'll still pass. Sheldon Cooper doesn't just pass.

The force of this impact splits that atom apart, releasing a tremendous amount of energy, fission and the graphite. In our BMK reactors, we surround the fuel rods with graphite to moderate, slow down the neutron flux. I know how a nuclear reactor works. Now I don't need you.

So it's my husband's 40th birthday. I'm in the kitchen making potato salad, right? Hair tied up, apron on, trying to get everything ready before his family shows up. He comes in complaining that I forgot to pick up the ice. I'm like, babe, it's on the list. I'm getting it in an hour. He rolls his eyes hard. Of course you forgot. can't even handle basic party planning without screwing something up. Then he mutters, no wonder I have to double check everything you do. I just stood there, spatula in hand, trying not to cry. But my 11 year old daughter Grace was sitting at the table decorating his birthday cake. I heard everything. She didn't say a word, just kept piping frosting. I wiped my eyes and went to grab the ice. When I came back, Grace was still working on that cake, hadn't looked up once. I tried to peek at what she was writing, but she angled it away. It's a surprise, mom, she said quietly. Her voice had this edge I'd never heard before. This wasn't the first time he talked to me like that. Little digs here, insults there, always when he thought the kids weren't paying attention. But Grace is a smart kid. He's been paying attention. I kept running around setting up tables, pretending everything was fine. That's what I always did. Smile through it. Don't make A scene. Meanwhile, my chest felt tight and my hands were shaking. An hour later, guests start arriving. His parents, his brother, co workers, everyone. We're all in the backyard. I'm playing the perfect hostess, refilling drinks, laughing at jokes that aren't funny. His mom pulled me aside and squeezed my hand. You look tired, sweetie. You doing okay? I just nodded. I always said I was fine. Grace had disappeared with the cake. I figured she was adding final touches. I was too busy making sure his drunk uncle didn't fall into the pool and that there were enough burgers on the grill. Then his brother clinked a glass. Speech time and cake. Everyone gathered around. Grace came through the sliding door carrying that cake like it was the Olympic torch. Face completely serious. Candles were lit, flickering in the evening breeze. Everyone started singing. His face lit up like a little kids. He loves being the center of attention. I stood there singing along, watching him soak it all in, feeling this weird mix of resentment and sadness. This man I'd spent 15 years with, this man who used to bring me flowers, now he couldn't talk to me. With basic respect, Grace place the cake down right in front of him. She stepped back, arms crossed and waited. Then he sees it written in massive blue frosting letters across the entire cake. Apologize to mom first. Dead silence. His mom gasps. His brother's trying not to laugh. He's turning red, stammering Grace, this isn't funny. She crosses her arms. Neither is how you talk to her. No cake until you apologize. I'm serious. His face went through about five different emotions, shock, anger, embarrassment, panic. He looked at me like I'd put her up to it. I just shook my head. This was all her. His co worker broke the silence. What's this about, man? Now he's really sweating. His mom wasn't smiling anymore. She had this look on her face like pieces were clicking into place. His mom nodded slowly. She's right, son. Now everyone's staring at him waiting. His brother crossed his arms. His dad raised an eyebrow. The silence was so thick you could cut it with a knife. Grace didn't budge, didn't break eye contact with her father. This little 11 year old girl standing her ground against a grown man who'd just been humiliated in front of everyone he knew. I saw his jaw clench for a second. I thought he might explode. But he looked around at all those faces judging him in real time and something shifted. Finally he looks at me and says, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. His voice cracked a little or maybe he was just cornered. Either way, Grace wasn't satisfied. Say you're sorry for all of it, dad. Not just today. He swallowed hard, looked at the ground. I'm sorry for, for how I've been treating you. You don't deserve that. The backyard Was still silent. Then his mom started clapping, slow, but first. Then his brother joined in. And suddenly everyone was clapping. Not for him, for Grace, for me. Grace smiles. Good. Now everyone can eat. She cut him the smallest slice. His mom got the biggest. I've never been prouder.

We were on the train coming back home from dinner with my family. My husband sat next to me, scrolling through his phone with his jaw clenched, still bitter that I dragged him there. I tried to break the silence between us, showing him a funny video from my phone, bringing up a dramatic story from work. But he didn't look up, not even for a second. Fine, I thought, giving up. He'd been distant for months anyway, so it's not like this was new to me. The next stop, a group of men stumbled on, five of them. Loud and drunk. They stood near us, laughing and moving around erratically in a way that made everyone else on the train uncomfortable. One of them noticed me immediately. Hey, look at this one, he said to his friends loud enough for half the train to hear. I kept my eyes down. The guy moved closer. You're too pretty to look so sad. Smile for me. I didn't respond. He chuckled and leaned in close to my face. Hey, I'm talking to you. His breath reeked of whiskey. Please leave me alone, I said quietly. His friends laughed. One of them whistled. The first guy reached out and touched my hair, swinging his hips toward my face. I flinched and pulled away, glaring and shaking. Don't touch me. He grinned and did it again, this time tugging at my clothes. Relax. I'm being friendly. I want us to be friends, he whispered in my ear. I turned to my husband, hoping he'd help me out. Our eyes met for half a second and then he looked away, turning his shoulder before he continued scrolling through his phone while me, his wife, continued getting harassed on the train. The guy noticed and patted my husband's shoulder. Ah, husband giving you the cold shoulder. Guess that means you're free. Game. The man pulled me out of my chair, holding my wrist tight while his other arm slipped around my waist. Let's dance, he said, swaying behind me. Stop it, I said louder, watching more and more people stare. His friends were egging him on, laughing like it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen. Finally, an older woman across from.

The champagne glass nearly slipped from my hand. He's here right now? Yeah, he's at the bar right there. But don't worry. He did anger management, and he's supposedly a totally different person. I turned and saw him across the reception hall, chatting with the groom. The last time I'd seen him, Liam, I'd been on the bathroom floor, spitting teeth into my palm while he stood over me fixing his hair in the mirror. Now he was laughing, holding a beer. Then he saw me watching. He raised his glass in a small toast and smiled. Not his old aggressive smile. Something softer, apologetic. I excused myself to the bathroom, my heels clicking too loud on the marble floor. In the mirror, I fixed my lipstick with shaking hands and told myself, maybe he had changed. Maybe I could get through the wedding. But when I came out, he was waiting in the hallway. I froze, but he held up both hands, palms out. He said, I know you don't want to talk to me. I just wanted to say I'm sorry. The therapy made me understand what I did. His voice was different, calmer. He said, I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm different now. I walked past him, and he let me go. He even stepped aside to give me more room. Back at the reception, I tried to Relax. Maybe he really had changed. Twenty minutes later, a groomsman I didn't know approached me. He said, you're the maid of honor, right? The bride needs you on the roof deck. Something about her dress. I said, what's wrong with her dress? He said, I don't know. She just said it's an emergency and to get you right away. I followed him to the service elevator. He pressed the button for the roof and said, she's pretty upset. Something tore. The elevator opened to the roof deck, where the venue sometimes did ceremonies. But it was dark, no lights on, and I didn't see the bride anywhere. I turned to ask the groomsman, but he was already back in the elevator. Doors closing, I called out, wait, but the door is shut. I pulled out my phone to call the bride, but had no signal up here. Then I heard footsteps behind me. Liam stepped out from behind the ventilation unit. He said, she's not coming. Her dress is fine. My blood went cold. I ran for the elevator, but he was faster, blocking me. I tried to dodge around him, but he grabbed my wrist, the familiar grip that left bruises for weeks. He said, that was my cousin who brought you up. Told him you and I needed to talk privately about the restraining order. He was happy to help.

Rafael and I were that couple everyone roots for. I'm known for my ridiculous positivity. The girl who finds joy in traffic jams and rainy days. That pisses normal people off. Three years in, and he still looks at me like I hung the moon. We cook dinner together every night, dancing to terrible music. His friends say I'm the light of his life. I've never been someone who cried. Ever. It started with small things. I canceled movie night too help my mom with something. Rafael offered to come. I said no too quickly. The next week, I was staring at my phone during dinner. Even though I used to preach about table manners, he asked who was texting. Just my mom, I said, flipping it back into my pocket. My hands were trembling. Two weeks later, I was crying in the bathroom at his birthday party. His sister found me, mascara everywhere. I blamed it on work stress. That definitely sounded like a lie. She told Rafael I was acting suspicious. After that, he started watching me closer. He noticed I wasn't eating much, not singing in the shower anymore. When he surprised me with lunch at work, I wasn't there. My coworker mentioned I've been taking long breaks lately, coming back with red eyes. He started talking to my roommate, Ulyssa. She admitted I've been crying myself to sleep. He confronted me that night. What's going on? Are You seeing someone else? The question broke something in me. I sobbed harder than I ever had. I couldn't catch my breath. He held me, but I saw fear in his eyes. Just tell me what's wrong, he begged. I opened my mouth. I almost said it. But then I remembered what's been keeping me quiet this whole time. His dad. He went through three years of cancer. Rafael holding his dad's hand in hospice. Rafael not eating for weeks after. Rafael telling me that watching someone die of cancer broke something in him he was still fixing. He's in therapy now, finally healing. So I couldn't do it. I couldn't make him relive that nightmare. My mom had maybe three months. The doctors were clear. I've been driving her to chemo every Tuesday and Thursday. The days I told him I had meetings. The experimental treatment she was doing wasn't working. She was getting weaker. Yesterday she forgot my name for 10 seconds. Rafael was still waiting for an answer. I wiped my face. I don't think I can do this anymore, I whispered. It wasn't what I meant to say. I meant I couldn't do this. Watching my mom disappear while pretending everything was fine. But he heard something else. You're breaking up with me? His voice cracked. I was about to correct him and explain and what I meant, but then he said my mom was right. She said, you've been distant since you visited your parents. Last month. Last month when we got the diagnosis. When the doctor said aggressive and limited options. When my dad collapsed in the hospital parking lot. I'm sorry. I managed. It was all I could say. Without lying or telling the truth. Raphael stood up. I deserve someone who actually wants to be here. Someone who isn't checked out. Each word was a knife, but I took it. Because he was right. I wasn't here. I was in oncology wards and support groups and medical trials. I was googling survival rates at 3:00am and planning for a world without her. He packed his things. Five minutes to erase three years. At the door, he turned. Whatever is really going on with you, I hope you figure it out. I nodded, tears streaming. He thought my tears were about us, but it was about the text I just got. Honey, can you drive me to chemo tomorrow? Dad's too upset to drive straight. I heard the door slam. Two months later, Rafael ran into my dad at the grocery store. Dad looked exhausted. By saltines and ginger ale, the same things Raphael's mom used to buy. They stood awkwardly by the soup aisle. So how's she? Raphael asked, trying to be polite. About the breakup. Taking it day by day, dad said vaguely. His eyes lit up. The breakups been hard on her, too? Dad looked confused. Breakup? No, I meant everything else. What everything else? Dad studied him. She didn't Tell you why she ended things

It all started in junior year after me and my girlfriend Thalia broke up. You see, Thalia and I had dated for six months. Nothing dramatic. Just six months of hand holding and awkward first kisses before we mutually decided we were better as friends. No hard feelings, no drama. We'd even joke about it sometimes. Then she started dating Shay, this varsity wrestler with a muscular build and huge ego. I remember the exact moment everything changed. I was at my locker when I heard his voice behind me. What's up, buddy? The way he said it, dripping with this weird aggression, made my stomach drop. Before I could turn around, his fist connected with my chest so hard, I slammed back into the lockers. Later, I found out he'd been scrolling through Thalia's Instagram and found our old couple photos. Apparently, his brain couldn't process his girlfriend had dated someone who chose books over the gym. The thing was, it became this sick ritual. Every single day, same performance. What's up, squirt? Followed by a chest punch. Left bruises I'd examine in the bathroom mirror at night. Purple and green patches spreading across my ribs like watercolors. At first, Thalia would tell him to stop, but he'd just laugh and say we were just playing around. Eventually, she stopped saying anything at all. She'd just look away. And somehow that hurt worse than the punches. Everyone Knew why he did it. I'd catch the whispers. That's Thalia's ex. Whenever it happened, my friends kept saying to just avoid them. But we were in all in the same friend circles. Same classes, name, everything. The breaking point came on a Tuesday. Thalia and I got paired for Chemistry Lab. And for twenty minutes, it was like old times. We were laughing about Mr. Telford's too pay shifting when he got excited about covalent bonds. Just innocent, stupid stuff. But Shay saw us from across the cafeteria, and I watched his face go dark. He didn't even say his usual line. He just walked over. And by the look in his eyes, I knew this was going to be different. Punch that landed on my lanky, malnourished self knocked the wind out of me completely. I was on the ground wheezing, making these pathetic gasping sounds while everyone stared. Thalia stood there, frozen between helping me and standing by him. And she chose him. Of course she did. I walked home instead of going to class. And with each step, something inside me shifted. I was done being the victim in his stupid power play. Done being the example of what happens when you date his girlfriend before him. By the time I got home, I knew exactly what to do. I decided to go on Amazon and order a surprise for Shay. Something that no one could see coming. Something that would make Shay cry. His eyes Out! What the hell are you doing with that? My brother asked when he saw the order history. I lied and told him it was for a school project, and he believed me. When it arrived two days later, I felt the surprise in my hands and thought about how much it would make him regret how he treated me. It was thicker than I expected, but solid. Like holding a piece of metal that could ruin his life. That morning, walking into school wearing it under my hoodie, my heart was pounding so hard I thought everyone could hear it. But there was this chaos in my chest. This wild excitement mixing with terror. I deliberately walked past their usual spot by the junior lockers. Lunchtime, main hallway. Maximum audience. If I was doing this, everyone was going to see it. When Shay saw me, a helpless

Mom and dad were worth millions. Built their company from nothing, lived in a mansion that looked like it was ripped from Architectural Digest. Every family gathering was a networking event where my siblings would pitch their latest business ideas or drop hints about their financial struggles. The four of us had always assumed we'd split everything equally when they died. We assumed wrong. The lawyer's office was act. My brother Beckham flew in from Dubai, where he was closing deals. My sister Harley interrupted her honeymoon in Bali. My other brother, Felix, brought his lawyer, already prepared to contest whatever the will said. I came straight from my shift at the hospital where I work as a nurse. Your parents left specific instructions, the lawyer said, pulling up a projector screen. Your inheritance will be determined by your score on this quiz. A Kahoot game loaded on the screen. Family trivia. 50 questions. A lawyer handed us tablets. This is insane, Beckham said. They can't be serious. Question one, the lawyer read. What was your mother's middle name? I typed Lorelai. Felix typed Lauren. Beckham and Harley were frantically texting each other. The results flashed on screen. Only I got it right. Question 2. What was your father's first job? I typed janitor. My siblings put various tech positions wrong, wrong, wrong. By question 10, the pattern was clear. Beckham had three correct Harley had two, Felix had four. I had 10. What medication did mom take daily? I knew it was metformin for her diabetes. My siblings didn't even know she was diabetic. Dad's biggest fear? Heights. He told me during our monthly lunches when my siblings were too busy to show up. The name of mom's chemotherapy nurse. Alyssa. I knew because I went to every appointment. Mom had cancer. Harley yelled, this is bullshit! Beckham stood up. How are we supposed to know mom had cancer? She never told us she did. I said quietly, at Sunday dinners, you just never came. The questions got more personal. What made dad cry at his 70th birthday? I typed, when no one but Jocelyn me showed up. Correct. What was Mom's favorite book? The one I gave her last Christmas. My siblings hadn't given gifts in years, just sent assistance with gift cards. Where did your parents have their first date? The diner on Fifth Street. Dad told the story every anniversary dinner. I was the only child who attended them. Beckham threw his tablet down at question 30. This is rigged. You obviously help them make this. When did your parents renew their vows? Last summer in their backyard. I was the only witness. My siblings were at various retreats, conferences, and yacht parties. What surgery did dad have in 2,019? Triple bypass. They were all too busy to visit. I took three weeks off work. The final question appeared. What did Your parents value most, I typed. Being seen as people, not checkbooks. The final scores flashed me 48 out of fifty. Felix, 7 out of 50. Beckham, 5 out of 50. Harley, 4 out of 50. The lawyer clicked to the next screen. A video message from my parents appeared. If you're watching this.

Will fail within a month. He said, decline it. You're not leadership material. That night, I started planning. First, I opened a secret bank account, funneling small amounts from cash back at grocery stores. Then I rented a studio apartment two towns over under my middle name.

Current was strong that week. Three people had drowned that year. Perfect cover. I watched from across the river as police arrived. Richard sobbing dramatically for the cameras. She was so fragile. I knew she couldn't handle the pressure. The search lasted three days, divers, helicopters, news coverage. Richard gave interviews about my mental struggles and how he'd tried to protect me from myself, me. Meanwhile, I was in my studio apartment, hair dyed black, working remotely under my new identity. I watched Richard's performance on The news, the grieving widower. He even started a mental health foundation in my name, which he used to fund his gambling habit, I later Learned. Three months in, he moved his secretary into our house. Four months in, he sold my jewelry, claiming it was too painful to keep. Five months in, he proposed to the secretary with my grandmother's ring. Six months in, the day before his wedding, I came back, walked into the church.

One afternoon, I'm cutting hair like usual when this furious mom storms into the shop dragging her son by the arm. She walks straight up to my chair, yanks off the kid's hoodie and shouts, explain this, you jingle nut! The second I saw his head, I nearly dropped my clippers. Half his hair was buzzed to the scalp, the other half still long, and right in the middle was a bald patch that looked like someone took a cheese grater to his skull. I tried to keep straight face and said, ma'am, I swear we didn't do this. But she wasn't buying it. She slammed her purse on the counter and said, we were here last week. Don't try to lie. Her kid looked terrified. I leaned in and quietly asked, hey, buddy, did you really get this haircut here? He looked at me, then at his mom, and whispered, no, my mom did it. The whole shop froze. Even the clippers went silent. She shot him a death glare and said, excuse me. The kid panicked. I, I mean, yes, sir, you did it. I meant you. But it was too late. Everyone in the shop burst out laughing. One barber had to sit down, another was wiping his eyes. The guy getting a low taper fade couldn't hold it in. I turned back to her and said, so, just to be clear, you gave him this haircut? And then came here to blame us. Her face turned bright red. I just wanted to fix it a little. But he moved. It's not my fault. I felt bad for the kid, so I told him, alright, hop in, let's fix this up. Gave him a clean fade, fixed everything, and handed him the mirror. He looked at himself and said, Yo, I actually look human again. His mom grabbed her purse and rushed out without saying a word. A week later, the kid came back with a girl this time and handed me 10 bucks. He smiled and said, thanks for saving my life.

He shrugged, yeah, go for it. Alright then. Not my hair, not my problem. I grabbed the clippers and started buzzing. Halfway through, I asked him one more time just to be certain. He looked in the mirror, grinned, and said, bro, I should have done this ages ago. I finished up, brushed him off, and handed him the mirror. His face. He slid up. This kid was rubbing his head like he'd unlocked a superpower. Then his mom walked in. The second she saw him, she went full meltdown. What did you do? I calmly said, I gave him the haircut he asked for. He looked at me like I just kicked a puppy. Her son tried to explain, but she cut him off with a don't say a single word, ma'am, he's almost an adult. He asked for it three times. I told her it was $30, but instead of paying, she just reached into the tip jar and took the cash out of there. I was stunned. Like, did She really just pay me with my own money. Then she stormed out. A couple of seconds later, the kid walks back in alone, slides a thirty dollar Bill onto the counter, and says, sorry about that. I actually love it. As he walked out, he turned back, ran a hand over his head again, and said, Loki, I'm thinking of going fully bald next time. Yeah, he's not coming back with his mom again.

Last week, my 10 year old daughter Lucy came home with clumps of her hair missing from scalp. Before I could ask her what was going on, she sprinted up the stairs and slammed her door shut. Leave me alone, daddy. I don't wanna talk about it. I wanted to tell myself that something probably happened after a weird game with her friends or maybe it was an accident. But there was a pattern. For the last two months, Lucy had come home sick every single day. I'd let her stay home whenever she showed symptoms and make sure she was 100% healthy before sending her to school again. But every time without fail, she'd get sick again. She was never healthy for longer than three days at a time. I figured it was just her immune system. But now with the clumps of hair missing, I knew something darker was going on. I went upstairs and knocked on her door. Honey, what happened at school today? No response. I asked again. Still nothing. I'm not mad, sweetie. I just need to know what's going on. That's when I heard it. She started crying, the kind of crying that would make any father's stomach drop with anxiety. I told you to leave me alone, daddy. I didn't sleep that night. My mind kept racing with every horrible possibility. Was someone hurting? Her? Was she being bullied? Was a teacher doing something? I had no idea what was happening to my little girl, and she wouldn't let me help her. The next morning, I called her best friend's mom. I figured maybe she must know something. I tried to sound casual, asked if she had mentioned anything weird going on at school. There was this long pause then.

My husband Eric had always been a jokester and it's one of the things I fell in love with. But over the years, the jokes became meaner. He started calling me his old ball and chain. When his buddies were around, he pat my stomach and say, expanding again this year or tell his co workers how some people age like fine wine and how unfortunately I was aging like cheese. Laugh. But their faces would always look just as uncomfortable as mine. Then last week during my birthday dinner with his parents, Eric raised his glass and stood up to toast me to my beautiful wife, he said. And for a second my heart lifted. Then he grinned and added, my adorably ugly old lady, happy birthday. Here's to another year. Only a few more until I get to collect that life insurance policy. Everyone at the table laughed nervously. I felt my heart sink in disappointment. You know, your joke really went too far this time. I told him in the car later, actually, all of your jokes lately have been nothing but mean and I don't appreciate it. I thought back to yours as I explained how much his words hurt, how every joke chipped away at my confidence, how I didn't recognize myself anymore because I started to believe the things he said about me. He pulled up on the side of the road and stared at me for a long moment before saying, babe, are you serious being dramatic over nothing? It was just light teasing. You know me, but I've also been telling you for weeks how much I didn't like your jokes. I said quietly, well, it's not like they're lies. You are getting older and it doesn't help that you've been letting yourself go ever since we had kids. Can't you just do what most people do and let it go and one ear and out the other, he suggested. That's when I realized he'd never understand, not unless he felt it himself. The next morning, I opened up about the situation to our family and friends. His sister stayed quiet for a long time before admitting, I've been watching him do this to you for years. You deserve better and we'll help him see that. She started it off casually the next time she met with my husband. Hey, Eric, I noticed your hair has been thinning. Don't worry, bald is attractive on some people, she said. I watched Eric touch his head, forcing his smile. Then during his golf game, Eric's best friend called him his little punching bag, mentioning how hard it was constantly beating him in each match. This time, Eric got annoyed and told him to back off. His friend just grinned and patted his back. Come on, man. Learn to take a joke. Eric's mom Also made comments over dinner. Eric, Honey, are those new pants, they make you look a little frumpy. Maybe you should hit the gym more. She said it so sweetly that he couldn't argue. Even his co workers had joined him, calling him Mr Mediocre in meetings, making jokes about his boring presentations. One guy even patted his shoulder and said in that same sarcastic tone Eric always used on me, don't worry, buddy, not everyone can be a star. By the end of the week, Eric was coming home looking more defeated each day. He checked himself in the mirror constantly, justing his shirt or running his hand over his thinning hair. He stopped making jokes entirely. Then last night he came home and collapsed onto the couch next to me. He put his head in his hands and just sat there for a long moment. I don't know what's happening, he finally said. It's like everyone's turned against me. My best friend thinks I'm a punching bag. My coworkers think I'm mediocre and boring. Even my own mother thinks I terrible. His voice cracked. And my boss, the one person whose opinion actually mattered to me, called me his adorable little slacker in front of my whole team today. I've never felt so humiliated. He looked at me with genuine pain in his eyes. I feel like I'm not good enough at anything anymore. Like I'm just this pathetic, balding, frumpy guy I who peaked years ago and Everyone can see it but me. I sat there listening to him list every single insecurity that had been planted in him over the past week, the same insecurities he'd been planting in me for years, the same words, the same tone, the same crushing weight of being torn down by the people.

You super liked me. It was an accident, I repeated desperately. I was half asleep, scrolling too fast. I didn't mean to. Eloise. He sat down at his desk, pulling out his phone. I need to ask you something, and I need you to be honest. My heart was pounding so hard I was sure he could hear. When you saw my profile, before your thumb allegedly slipped, what did you think? The question caught me off guard. I. What? What did you think when you saw my profile? He was studying my face intently. Before the accident. I felt heat rising to my cheeks. I don't know what you want me to say. The truth, he said. Simply because I've been sitting here since Saturday trying to figure out what to do about the situation, and I need to know if this was really just an accident, or if maybe, possibly some part of you meant to right. Anyway, the office suddenly felt airless. That's Connor. You're my boss. I'm aware, he said, leaning back in his chair. I'm very, very aware. Which is why I've been driving myself insane all weekend. He ran his fingers through his hair, clearly frustrated at the situation I caused. When I saw your profile, I couldn't swipe right. He swallowed like it pained him. Because I'm your boss would be inappropriate. It could ruin both our careers. But you super liked me. And for About 10 seconds. I thought maybe the universe was giving me permission, until I realized it was probably an accident. He stood up and walked back to the window. Was this real? Was he saying what I thought he was saying? But I need to know, Eloise. Was any part of it real? Or was it completely an accident? I stood up too, my legs shaky. I took a leap of faith. If you weren't my boss, I said slowly, I would have super liked you on purpose. I would have swiped right immediately. But you are my boss. So, yes, it was an accident. My thumb slipped because I was nervous seeing you there, and I was holding my phone too tight. He turned to look at me, something changing in his expression. Hope. I'm leaving the company, he said suddenly. What? I got an offer from another company two weeks ago. I accepted it Friday. My last day here is March 15th. The room spun slightly. You're leaving? He nodded. Which means in three weeks, I won't be your boss anymore. The weight of what he was saying settled over the room. He wasn't my boss for much longer. So would you let me take you to dinner on March 16th? Yes, I said.

I turned around and me and the old man locked eyes. His hands were clasped together and he started mouthing the word please. Me and my bestie Fifi stepped back. Get the hell away from us, I said boldly. It's giving Michael Jackson. Fifi chimed in, getting ready to throw her Stanley at the old man. Suddenly, he dropped down to his knees on the sand and started rocking back and forth. Please, I didn't mean to seem weird. I just need you girls to pee on me. We were just about to start screaming for help when a lifeguard finally popped up. I spoke first. Thank goodness you came. This man is a freak. Fifi nodded. Please call the police. Get him off this beach. The lifeguard immediately crouched down to check the old man's breathing. What happened here? Did you girls beat him down? He laughed like it was a joke, but nothing about this was funny. The old man took a deep breath to speak. I, I just asked them to pee on me. The lifeguards whole face changed. He looked at the old man's face, which was now completely scrunched up as if he was in excruciating pain, then back at us with pure disgust. The disgust wasn't directed at the old man. It was directed at us. What the hell is Wrong with you 2. His voice was sharp and he acted like we just kicked a puppy. Why didn't you just do it? I felt my jaw drop. Was this lifeguard seriously taking the side of some pervert who wanted us to pee on him? Fifi grabbed my arm. Excuse me, you're mad at us. The lifeguard was already on his radio calling for paramedics while shaking his head. Unbelievable. You kids today have no compassion at all. The old man was getting worse, his breathing becoming these horrible wheezing sounds that made my stomach turn. I kept thinking about how we'd come to the beach for cute photos and now we were somehow the villains in this insane situation where a stranger wanted us to pee on him. The paramedics arrived within minutes. First one took one look at the old man and immediately started working on him. The second paramedic, a woman with gray hair, turned to us with this look of absolute disappointment. You two should be ashamed of yourselves, she said, while helping load him onto a stretcher. All he needed was for you to help him and you couldn't even do that. What happened to respecting your elders? He kept going on about how our generation was selfish while they wheeled him into the ambulance and drove to the hospital. He asked us to pee on him, I shouted, but she just shook her head like I was making excuses. Why was everyone acting like We were monsters for not peeing on a random old man. Against my better judgment, I grabbed Fifi's hand. We need to follow them to the hospital. She looked at me like I was crazy, but I had to know what was happening. We called an Uber and spent the whole ride in silence, both of us replaying the beach scene, trying to understand what we'd missed. It took an hour of sitting around and playing Pokemon Go in the waiting room before a student nurse finally came out and pointed at us. The old man from the beach is stable now, but he almost died because these two teenage girls refused to help him. Every single person in that waiting room turned to stare at us. Someone muttered, some people only care about themselves, loud enough for us to hear. I felt tears burning my eyes because nothing made sense. We didn't do anything. I finally screamed, standing up. He asked us to pee on him for free. Why would I do that? The whole world must have heard me shout because that's when a doctor appeared beside me. Are you two the girls from the beach incident? We nodded and he lowered his voice. So you really don't know what you did wrong? Fifi shook her head, no, he just asked us. Shh. The doctor interrupted. You're disturbing the whole ward. Come with me. We followed him into a room and that's when he finally explained what the Freak was going on. That man was stung by a box jellyfish. He has a thing called ammonia, which neutralizes the venom. It.

So I screwed her golden child sister and realised I dated the wrong sibling. We've been together 10 years. High school sweethearts turned into complete strangers living under the same roof. After college, everything fell apart. She refused to work, spent every single day locked in our guest room, stream to 5 viewers on Twitch making zero dollars while somehow racking up 8 900 dollars in online gambling debt that I had to help pay off. I was the only one working, paying rent, groceries, utilities, everything. And she had the audacity to complain that I work too much. We couldn't be in the same room without screaming at each other. Therapy didn't work. I knew she wanted out but couldn't leave because she was completely dependent on me. Then we lost our baby. That's when everything got worse. She blamed me, told me I wasn't a real man because my body couldn't do what it was programmed to do, said I caused the loss of her child and it was all my fault. She moved into the guest room permanently, told me she couldn't stand looking at my body anymore, that I disgusted her. I cried myself to sleep for months, felt like I wasn't good enough for anything or anyone. Three weeks ago I found out why her mood suddenly changed. She got weirdly happy out of nowhere, started getting dressed up to run errands, came Home smiling. We weren't being intimate at all. So it was obvious something was up. She left her icloud sync to the iPad. Every single text message with my best friend since kindergarten was right there. They've been sleeping together for months, making plans, talk, talking about me behind my back, laughing about how clueless I was. I felt sick. This was my first love and my closest friend both destroying me at the same time. Last weekend, she told me she was driving 3 hours to visit her dad, but her messages told the truth.

No nut. November. I used to have a best friend named Jack. Everything was cool until he started making gay jokes. He wasn't even gay. He was just trying to be annoying. It started small at first. Normal joked about me being handsome and stuff like that. But within weeks, the gay jokes became his new form of rage bait. He'd make jokes about how I want him. So when we both got detention at the same time, he kept calling it our detention date and making kissy faces when the teacher wasn't looking. We were five minutes into detention when his hand starts moving up and down under the desk at lightning speed. And there's no paper on his desk. It. It was like he was asserting dominance or something, making sure I knew this was about me. He was breathing like he just ran a Marathon while sitting completely still. He looks up right at me. Not a glance. Full eye contact while his hand is still going full turbo under the desk. My brain just froze. Like when your computer shows you that spinning wheel of death. Then I noticed his chair. He's turned it toward me. And the angle. When he finishes, it's gonna hit my face. I had two minutes, maybe less. His face was getting red. I tried to reach for the phone in my pocket to someone to help, but the teacher, Mister Evans, notices Instantly. Phone on my desk. Now. Mister Evans has a radar for phones, I swear. You know the rules. I walk up and put it on his desk. Locks it in his drawer. Great. No lifeline, no evidence, no nothing. While I was walking back, I can see Jack tracking me with his eyes. That same smirk from when he'd make his stupid jokes. But his hand hasn't stopped moving. I get up real quiet and start moving to the empty seat behind him. Where do you think you're going? Evans doesn't even look up. It's assigned seating only. Go back to your seat, sir. I just need to. You need to apologize to Jack for disrupting his concentration and sit back down. Wait, what? I'm sorry. Go on, apologize. I look at Jack. His smirk gets bigger. Sorry, Jack. His voice comes out all breathless and weird. It's cool, bro. Good. Now sit down. The walk back felt like death row. Lucia, the girl I've had a crush on since freshman year, notices what's happening. Her face goes from confused to horrified to.

So buckle up, because this isn't one of those he fired me and I found a better job karma law posts. No, this is a scorched earth, burn the bridge, salt the ashes situation. I worked at this small tech company for 3 years. I busted my ass. I pulled 70 hour weeks. I trained his nephew. I basically ran the whole damn department while this loud, balding, overcaffeinated micromanager sat in his glass office pretending to be Steve Jobs. Last month, I walked in on a Monday morning and found an HR email waiting for me. Not a meeting, not a warning. An email. We regret to inform you that due to restructuring, your position has been terminated, effective immediately. Restructuring my ass. The next day, I found out his nephew, the same one who asked me how to attach a PDF, got my job and a pay raise. So I snapped. And when I snap, I don't break plates. I break lives. I knew three things. One, his wife Samantha, hated him. Two, his son Tyler, 22, was in my DMs months ago. Oh. His daughter Mia, 25, once told me at a company barbecue that she likes people who take risks. Do you see where this is going? I started with Samantha. I took her out for drinks to vent. One thing LED to another, and let's just say she vented in ways her husband Hadn't experienced in years then because apparently I fully unlocked my villain arc. I replied to Tyler's old DM. Still wanna grab that drink? Tyler came over. We grabbed more than drinks. I'll spare you the details, but let's just say his Xbox wasn't the only thing overheating that night. And then Mia. God bless Mia. She's gorgeous, she's chaotic, and apparently she had a vendetta against her dad too. Within 48 hours, I had an entire side quest going with his entire family tree. Here's where it gets truly evil. I knew my ex boss had a ring camera system. Guess who accidentally left their Bluetooth speaker connected to their living room TV? Yeah, he saw everything live in 4K. Next Monday he tried to confront me in the parking lot of a Starbucks. I just smiled, sipped my caramel macchiato, and said, should have attached the termination letter as a PDF. Boss. The man's face turned the color of a sunburnt tomato. Do I regret it? Absolutely not. Do I have a job now? Also no. But you know what I do have? Peace, satisfaction, and at least three birthday invites to family barbecues he will never attend again. And that, my friends, is how you turn a layoff into a legacy.

He wiped away the moisture and dressed her with simple care. But this time he encountered a body that it seemed unusual. Her eyes refused to close, and no matter how long he gently massaged them, nothing worked. So he finally took out a bit of glue and sealed the eyelids together. Then he began applying makeup. As the most seasoned mortuary artist, he brushed a soft blush onto her cheeks, shaped her brows and added a delicate color to her lips. Yet something felt off. The woman's mouth stayed open the whole time. The man retrieved a coin, murmured a short incantation, and the moment he placed the coin into the corpse's mouth snapped shut immediately. Once everything was prepared, his co workers would come to wheel the body out so the family could say their final goodbye. Only then could the man take a brief rest.

Then he scraped mold off a stack of stale crackers, spread a bit of caviar on top and forced them down. It was all the food he had left. He had been trapped inside this mansion for three days. Turns out he was a thief who came to steal a famous painting. But just as he was about to escape, he typed in the wrong code. This activated the mansion's full security lockdown, sealing every door. His partners also lost contact with him. While he desperately searched for a way out, he noticed the front door was made entirely of thick hardwood. So he began carving at it with a knife. Soon he managed to cut a small opening only to find a solid steel plate behind it. In frustration, he went to the kitchen for water, but main valve had been shut off. Nothing came out. He stared at the toilet for a long while, hesitating, but he still couldn't bring himself to drink from it. He crawled into the indoor plant corner, dug out the automatic sprinkler pipe, but when he turned the valve, not a single drop load out. The fridge held nothing but expired caviar and cracker. The next morning, he discovered the fruit on the table was fake piece carved from stone. He hurled one at the window. The stone shattered, yet the glass didn't even crack. Suddenly, the Air conditioner began pumping heat into the room to cool himself. He rushed to the pool, only to find the water was salty. Even the aquarium was filled with unbearably salty seawater. Just as he was sinking into despair, he spotted a maid on the surveillance monitor and excitement surged through him. He grabbed an iron pot at once.

But the visitor cracks, says he has an asylum case coming up, can't afford trouble, and decides he's just going to take one watch and wipe off Every fingerprint, like he Learned from CSI. Then he hears the question, want to know why that guy's here? He says no. But the, the story comes anyway. Months earlier, the man had a nasty dispute with a business partner's wife. Things spiraled and he ended up with a serious injury to his foot. He couldn't go to a hospital without raising flags. So he called this underground doctor, paid cash and let him stitch him up. The guy handed him codeine and told him he'd walk it off. But three weeks later, a real doctor was telling him they'd need to cut off his leg. And the reason? Because the underground medic completely botched the job. That's who he is. That's why he's here.

That's when she realized the creature had forgotten to close the gate. She seized the moment, hauling herself out of the pit, everything she had, and racing toward the doorway. There she saw the creature forcing the man to nurse. She immediately turned and ran, bolting down the underground passage till she found a stair, only to discover the exit was locked high. The commotion alerted the creature. With no other option, she smashed open the basement window and scrambled outside. A homeless man happened to pull her to save if just in time. But when she looked back, she saw the creature's face twisted not with anger, but with heartbreaking sadness.

Melody, what are you doing here? She knows that the mainstreaming program has ended, right? Was everyone in invited to breakfast? Accept me no matter what I did or how good I was. You never treated me like a part of the team. I don't care. Not anymore. Yeah, I need a push, but I won't be pushed around. I just want to be in sixth grade. So I am staying so much cooler. Next question. Who said the famous line, doesn't matter what I sound like, all that matters is what I have to say because I'm not going anywhere, melody.

But immediately after shaking his hand, the millionaire openly sanitized his hands with alcohol multiple times. Though somewhat embarrassed, the man mustered his courage with hope. He proposed his idea of starting a low cost airline so that the poor could also enjoy air travel. However, this simple yet noble dream was harshly rejected by the millionaire. The millionaire declared that airplanes were built only for the rich. Not only did he refuse to invest, he also ordered his bodyguards to move the man to the economy section. This humiliating act infuriated Mara, who stated that he had purchased a first class ticket and had every right to stay there. The millionaire whispered a few words into a flight attendant's ear. Soon after, an announcement declared that the plane would be turning back. As dusk fell, Mara was escorted off the plane in the most humiliating manner. As he stepped out of the cabin, an elegant man in a gray suit stopped him. His name was Babu, a venture capitalist. He had overheard Mara's innovative idea for a low cost airline in the cabin. But before investing, he needed Mara to convince him with solid arguments. To explain his vision more clearly, Mara took him to a small street side restaurant. Initially, Babu disliked the noise and atmosphere.

Looking around, she could hardly believe her eyes. This entire situation was a carefully orchestrated setup by her husband.

After finishing her cleaning, the mother noticed the window was open, the wind blowing through. She closed it and left the room.

She believed that as long as the scene looked like a suicide, everyone would accept it without question. After sending her sister into the abyss, she quickly pulled out her phone and recorded a farewell video. Pretending to tremble, she said, if you ever find a body near my home, just know it's me. Once she finished, she attempted to upload the footage online. But just as the upload was nearly complete, she suddenly froze. A severed leg lay at the edge of the cliff, propped neatly against a rock. When she got closer, she realized it was a prosthetic. Her sister's real body was lying motionless at the bottom of the ravine. Only then did she remember her sister had been disabled all her life. The identity she had been imitating with such effort instantly became useless. She panicked as she recalled the video still uploading. Fortunately, the signal in the area was weak. She quickly switched her phone to airplane mode. Rushing downhill, she muttered, no, you can't replace me. People will know you're not me. She desperately searched for a way to fix the situation. Then she noticed a railway track nearby, the train thundering toward it. Looking at her own healthy legs, a dangerous thought struck her. If she placed the prosthetic on the track and let the train destroy it, it would appear her sister had no disability. With that evidence, no one would doubt the story. She carefully set the fake leg in the middle of the track, then hid behind a rock, holding her breath as she waited for the roar of steel.

He then set up his rifle from a distance, waiting patiently for his prey. Soon after, a van approached and stopped directly under the shoes. The doors swung open and two men looked around cautiously, ensuring no one was watching before hiding smuggled weapons in a nearby hole. Just then, the old man fired a shot into the air. The startled men immediately dropped to the ground, thinking they had been ambushed by the police. The old man fired another shot and the men relaxed, assuming it was just a hunter nearby, before resuming their work. As they climbed back into the van, the real trap was set in motion. The old man raised his rifle and aimed for the sneakers hanging high above. The bullet struck its Mark, causing the shoes to tear open. White powder poured out, showering the back of the van. The two men, still unaware, drove straight toward the heavily guarded border. However, during the inspection, a police dog suddenly stopped sniffing the back of their vehicle. The officer noticed the anomaly and quickly signaled his colleagues to search. Before the men had time to react, police swarmed them and swiftly subdued them. All of this had been part of the old man's plan. He wasn't a police officer. He simply wanted to teach the gang a lesson. But the Mafia boss didn't back down. In fact, he became even more Reckless.

The prisoner hid in a corner waiting for the guards inspection. Knowing the human field of vision spans only 180 degrees, he believed that staying out of sight would make him completely invisible. But as the guard entered the cell, he immediately spotted Tessek in the corner. Though this earned him a slap across the face, victorious smile spread across his face, proving his theory had been correct. He then began training in free climbing. The next day, when the guard returned for inspection, Tessek vanished from the cell once again. Only after the guard turned his back did he realize Tessek had scaled the wall. This enraged the guard, resulting in another brutal beating. Yet Tessek refused to give up. Theoretically, achieving invisibility meant perfecting his footwork to the extreme, allowing him to vanish from the guard's sight entirely. So when the guard returned for his next inspection, Tsek became more cunning. He mimicked the guards every step. Unexpectedly, this tactic worked. The guards searched for several minutes but could not find Tsek. Just when he believed his invisibility had succeeded, the sunlight cast a shadow betraying his position. The next second, something terrifying happened.

But what no one could have guessed was that the man's stealth technique had been Learned in prison. It turned out that Tessek was a college graduate, yet he never held a proper job. Instead, he would sneak into people's homes every day, brushing his teeth with their toothbrushes, showering in their bathrooms. Strangely, he managed to live undetected for years, thanks to his unique squatting method. He'd ride his motorcycle through the streets, posting flyers on doorways. If a flyer remained untouched for three days, it meant the house was empty. Then he'd slip inside with his lock picking tools, check the landline voicemail, listening for the owner's whereabouts in return times. Once he had these details, he'd stay in the house for a few days. But he didn't just reload. He would clean the house for the owners, wash their dirty laundry before leaving. He even took photos with the family. And this parasitic lifestyle gave him a strange sense of accomplishment. One day, Tessek moved into another new place. But what he never expected was that the homeowner was actually at home and had discovered the intruder. Strangely, she didn't make a sound.

No one knew how I survived day after day, except for Jeong San foam, the master of the Fuji sect, who visited me from time to time. He was the one who held the key to the thousand mechanism iron coffin. Every time he came, he'd bring fine wine and I would spar with him. As the world's number one great demon, I would occasionally teach him some of my secret techniques. But today, my subordinates, the faceless Judge and Shura G, suddenly stormed into the dungeon with their men. Somehow, they had stolen Jeongseong's key. When Shira G inserted the key into the lock, the countless mechanisms of the iron coffin began to unlock one by one. Then the steel rods embedded in my body began to slide out one after another. When the last rod finally left my body, I, who had been imprisoned for 12 long years, was finally free. But before anything else, there was business to attend to. My subordinates bowed respectfully as I stood up. I looked up at the ventilation shaft of the dungeon, wondering if I would see the moonlight tonight. Just then, the elders of the Wooda Pyi arrived with their disciples, calling me a demon of the evil sect. But strangely, I felt an unusual excitement. They were the perfect targets for me to begin loosening my chains.

Suddenly she found that the murderer on TV looked a lot like Jack, who was right beside her. So Anna quickly reminded him just when Jack said that the suspect had a beard, unexpectedly the announcer said that the suspect's beard was fake. And then they realised that the suspect without the beard looked very much like Jack in front of them. At that time, the broadcast said that the killer was 6 4 feet tall. Jack explained that he was only 5 4 feet tall. However, it turned out to be a slip of the tongue by the announcer. The real height of the suspect was actually 5 4 feet. And from the surveillance footage, they Learned about the music that the suspect was playing at that time. But Jack was relieved because that song was the one he hated the most. Just when they thought they had wrongly blamed Jack, the phone rang and the ringtone was exactly the same as the song mentioned in the broadcast. Jack immediately explained that must have been his mother who said it. the broadcast announced the specific time when the incident happened. And at that time, Jack had been playing with his girlfriend at Disneyland all day long. But then the broadcast suddenly said that the crime scene was in the underground garage of Disneyland. Jack immediately explained to his companions that there were 7 billion people on the earth and that it was probably just A coincidence, however, the broadcast informed that the witness said that at the crime scene, the suspect also said the same thing. Jack wanted to explain, but his companions didn't believe him anymore and told Jack that they hadn't heard anything. At this time, another notice came from the broadcast that whoever had information about the suspect could get $3 million. The three timid people immediately became interested in Jack, and we're ready to take him to the police station together. Just when they were convinced that Jack was the murderer, unexpectedly Jack took out a weapon and swore to them that he wasn't the killer. When Jack thought that the portrait didn't look like him at all, suddenly realized that he had been betrayed, Jack asked his girlfriend to hide aside and then immediately ordered Mike and the others to sit down. Unexpectedly, Jack was attacked by Anna, hearing that they were planning to take Jack to claim the reward and that his weapon had been taken away by Mike. Jack was almost on the verge of breaking down at this time. Another message came from the broadcast informing that the killer had been caught. This made them feel extremely embarrassed, so Anna immediately untied Jack. But just when they untied the rope and returned the weapon to Jack, suddenly the latest news came from the TV that they had arrested the wrong person.

Then he quickly escaped on a motorcycle. But the man in the car was busy waving his hands, trying to drive away the bees. As the bomb timer ticked closer, the man became more and more frustrated. He suddenly made a sharp drift and stopped the car on the side of the road. Only 14 seconds were left. The man, not knowing anything, was still fighting with the bees. One bee landed on the car. The man took off his shoe, ready to give it a fatal hit. From afar, the killer thought his plan had worked. But to his surprise, the man standing by the car was totally unharmed. The man, still clueless, proudly thought it was because of his own strength. Helpless, the killer had to continue his assassination the next day. He fired several shots at the man's car. Finally, one bullet hit the gas tank. Gasoline sprayed out instantly. But the man, still unaware, kept driving. While talking on the phone, he picked up the lighter. But it was broken, so he casually threw it out of the car. Unexpectedly, the gasoline on the ground caught fire. The unlucky killer drove straight into the flames. Almost roasted alive, he quickly jumped out of the car. The Jeep then crashed off the cliff. The killer never thought this mission would be so hard. Meanwhile, the man kept driving the leaking car. The boss, angry at the failure, decided To send the top assassin. Soon, the man drove into a gas station. The top assassin was already following him. He lifted his arm and a sharp dagger instantly popped out. He showed the scars on his arm, proving his victories. For him, this mission was nothing. But the man still had no idea of the danger. The gas station worker saw the small hole in the car and simply plugged it with chewing gum. The man stood nearby, using an air gun to blow dust off his head. He didn't know the assassin had taken out a special drug. The assassin quietly approached from behind. But the drug was blown away by the air gun and flew straight into the assassin's mouth. Once again, the lucky man escaped. A few hours later, the assassin woke up. Unfortunately, he triggered the daggers mechanism. The top assassin was dead. The boss realized the problem was serious. He sent five agents and they finally caught the man. They even arranged guards to watch him. Unexpectedly, the man suddenly burst out with strength. He broke the ropes in an instant and jumped out the window. But there were also heavy guards outside. The man raised his hands to surrender. Unexpectedly, that move worked out perfectly and he escaped.

She walked over, draped the towel around her mother, relieved to find her unharmed. She turned to return to the cabin to sleep but was jolted awake by a clamor. She rose to investigate. Pirates were boarding the ship. She retreated back into the cabin, quietly opened the door, unlock the box and retrieve the firearms. But when she peered out again, her mother's boyfriend had already fallen overboard and her mother was nowhere to be found. Terrified, she hid back in the cabin. The pirates opened the door and entered the cabin. She curled up in a corner. Fortunately, the pirates glanced around and left. She breathed a sigh of relief. But after they left, she peered out and saw flames through the door crack. Opening the door, she found the entire cabin engulfed in fire. She grabbed the fire extinguisher and fought the he's all night. Though the fire was extinguished, the ship was badly damaged. Huddled in the corner, she picked up a photo and discovered to her horror that her mother's new boyfriend was part of the pirate crew. That had boarded the ship the night before. She resolved to find and rescue her mother.

He crawled into the corner plant area, dug out the automatic sprinkler pipe and tried turning it on, but not a single drop of water came out. The fridge held nothing but expired caviar and crackers. The next day, he Learned that the fruit on the table wasn't real, but carved out of stone. He threw one at the glass window, but the stone shattered and the glass didn't even crack. Suddenly, the air conditioning started blasting heat. Trying to cool down, he went to the swimming pool, but the water there was salty. Even the fish tank was filled with extremely salty seawater. Just when he was about to give up, he spotted a maid on the surveillance monitor. Overjoyed, he grabbed an iron pot and banged on the door to get her attention.

Inherent in your argument is that we have to pander to certain communities based on the color of their skin because they can't do as well as white people. I want to thank you for something. Oh, yeah. You, you are a perfect reminder why we won a November. So thank you for that. I really appreciate it. Thank you.

Five years, I think I was in every country, but France was the best. Italy would be second for me. Russia is not desirable. Ukraine, it's okay. So, uh, when do you get out? When it is discharged. Even my captain gets transferred. The end of my second war. Jesus. I'm going home now. Manheim. I'll take this one. Cost got bitter. Okay. Hey, Webster. My relief. Don't salute the Germans. Oh, come on. I said to get a kick out of it. Anyway, I got me a new winner. Jacks 75 points. How about you? I mean, you're a Tacoma guy, right? I'm a new guy. Wouldn't you like to know? Discharged, huh? Go ahead, take off. It's my turn. Okay. See you back at the farm. 81. I have 81 points. Hahaha. Is that good enough
