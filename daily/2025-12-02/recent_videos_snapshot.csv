Her entire family hid in silence. By luck, when dinner was over and the lady went upstairs, the maid whispered frantically for her family to crawl out and escape. Just then, the homeowner's young daughter appeared at the foot of the stairs. She wasn't suspicious. She simply wanted to pitch a tent on the front lawn for the night. In that instant, the hidden family slipped under the sofa, their hearts pounding as the wealthy family lingered nearby. The night stretched endlessly. The little girl played outside in her cozy tent while her parents relaxed on the living room couch. Beneath them, the poor family lay perfectly still, barely daring to breathe. Only when the couple finally drifted into sleep did they slide out from beneath the sofa, tiptoeing toward the garage and vanishing quietly through the villa's back door. There's an old saying, a storm always exposes the distance between classes. The rich live above the flood, while the poor are swept downhill, carried away like fragments of a broken world. When the family returned home, the devastation was beyond belief. Their basement shelter was gone, water up to their waists, filth gushing endlessly from the toilet. Yet outside the mansion, the child's small tent remained untouched, dry, as if blessed by invisible fortune. Staring at the ruins, the eldest son made a silent vow, one day, no matter the Cost. He would climb his way into that upper world and give his family the life they had only dreamed of.

Doctor. Asher, are you ready for the swab? Um, yes. Sorry, I just. Culture swab, please. Okay. Okay. I will be right back. Wait, wait. Where are you going? It's okay. I'll be right back. I promise. Jenny's pelvic exam revealed a second degree perineal tear, and I saw umbilical cord coming from her cervix.

The police immediately set up more surveillance in the building and confirmed the exact location of his room. We began full preparations, even replacing the trash bags he had thrown away, to search for clues. But in the end, we found nothing important. Turned out the criminal knew all along that we were watching him. Later, I ran into him again at a local market. This time he gave me a thorough inspection, checking if I was armed, and even questioned my story about the spoiled apple. Relying on my memory, I accurately told him the price of the apple, pointed to another vendor, and immediately I said that the apples from that vendor were overpriced and of poor quality. I then invited him to dinner, and surprisingly, he agreed. It seemed like he was looking for a chance to check out my place. Once inside, he touched the surfaces of several pieces of furniture, looking for dust, trying to figure out how long we had been living there. Just when he was about to spot a flaw on a picture frame, quickly distracted him with a clever diversion. I even managed to get him to help me cook. Then out of the blue, he asked about the scar on Lisa's forehead. I froze for a moment, so I sent Lisa to talk to him, telling him I was heading to the bathroom.

The ocean and the painting on my wall suddenly made a sound. Before I could react, a huge wave of water poured out of the painting. I was so confused and curious, so I rushed over to take a closer look. But out of nowhere, a hand reached out from inside the painting, trying to pull me into the frame. Terrified, I started pounding on the wall for help. My dad heard the noise and ran in immediately. When he saw what was happening, he froze in shock. Then he rushed over and yanked me away from the painting. And the water that had spilled out flowed back into the picture and returned to normal. My mom was having her own strange experience. She saw a little boy she didn't recognize crawl into a painting. But when she walked over to check, the boy had somehow returned to the picture. As she stood there confused, a painting behind her suddenly made a noise. She was scared out of her mind. But when she turned to look, the little boy in the picture vanished again, like he was playing hide and seek with her. Frightened, she went after him, but by the time she reached the kitchen, the boy had disappeared again. Then the basement door suddenly creaked open, almost like it was inviting her in. Just as she felt something was wrong, the little boy appeared behind her and shoved her Down the stairs. When she woke up, she was already in the basement, and a woman with sharp claws was standing there. Terrified. She grabbed a flashlight and pointed it at her. But the woman vanished into thin air. My dad and I heard the noise and rushed into the basement. After hearing what had happened, I knew we couldn't stay in that house anymore. So we packed up and moved out that very night. But the evil things inside those paintings were not done with us yet.

But instead of being punished, I was reborn into a baby's body. Just when I thought I could use my memories to reach the peak of life, reality turned out to be the opposite. Watching my new mother act insane, I felt something was off. Sure enough, right after we got home, she threw me on the couch and yelled at my dad to feed me. Luckily, dad seemed like a decent guy. Then dad noticed the food had expired for 6 months, but mom said it didn't matter.

Hmm, your card's not working. Can I just get a copy of your passport or ID? Um, it's just for security and verification. This scam tricks you into handing over your identity. They say it's for security or verification, but once they have your info, they can clone your cards, open fake accounts and even sell your passport on the dark web. So always pay in cash when you can. But the scam almost nobody sees coming is a luggage scam. It's a two man scam that happens in seconds. One person creates a scene to distract you while the other secretly steals your bag. My bag, my bag is gone. Here's how to stop it. Use a bright, unique bag, one you can spot instantly and don't let it out of your sight. When you're at a baggage claim, stand close enough that your bag passes within arms reach. Oh, hey, hey.

All right, grab the license out of my pocket here. A white police officer stopped a black man for no reason, then demanded that he get out of the car. Hey, what did I do? Stop it! He didn't do anything. Because Dale's father had caused trouble for the police, they decided to take it out on Dale and even framed him. Daddy should have left well enough alone. But he was quickly bailed out by his father. You okay? Thinking about that scumbag framing him, Dale was boiling with anger. How you gonna do that, dad? This man pulled me out of the car and slammed me onto the hood. I thought, stuff like this one gonna happen to me because of who my dad is. Let's go home. We can talk about it. There's nothing to talk about. Seeing his father act like a coward made him furious. Watching his son walk away, he knew this was far from over. Luckily, the girl had caught evidence of the police framing Dale. At the same time, the father also tracked down the person who framed his son. You know, sometimes he doesn't want to use drugs. Hopefully, the judge will believe that, too. Little did he know, a major disaster was about to hit him. And a warrant has been issued for the print. Owen Campbell of the Moss Police Department. Campbell is the alleged mastermind behind an illegal narcotic distribution ring. We've obtained the video. Courtesy of the Texas Rangers. You're under arrest. I don't know how you got that warrant, but I'll be out by lunchtime.

I jumped off the bus and chased after the suspect, but I nearly got shot when I turned the corner. Just as I was carefully searching for him, the suspect casually walked out again. The moment he saw me pointing a gun at him, the man took off running. I didn't hesitate and shot him down. His gun flew out of his hand at the same time. Stay down. Don't you move. Don't you move. Don't you move. You stay down. After subduing the man, I sprinted back to my partner, but my partner was already unconscious. Soon the scene was flooded with police cars. I explained everything to my boss. The problem now was I lost sight of the man for a few seconds at the corner and the silver handgun was nowhere to be found. Even though surveillance confirmed the nature of the case, they still couldn't see the suspect's face. Luckily, we found a picture on his social media showing him holding a silver handgun. But when we looked into Mike's background, everyone could prove he was a good kid. His parents insisted I arrested the wrong guy. And when officers questioned Mike, he firmly claimed he was just heartbroken. So he went to the river to walk it off and happened to see the real attacker run past him. Then I supposedly shot him for no reason. Seeing how sincere Mike look, even the officers couldn't tell if he was lying. Meanwhile, a crowd. Of black residents gathered outside the station. They all came to defend Mike and demanded the harshest punishment for me. The situation even alarmed higher UPS. They ordered John to fully cooperate with the investigation. Thankfully, a helpful citizen recorded the entire incident, but he wanted to use it to blackmail the police. My buddy said I could sell this for major cash when obstruct an active investigation. Got it? The video clearly showed that after Mike was shot, he threw the silver gun into the river. So we quickly recovered the gun. The police then issued a public statement announcing that Mike committed attempted murder. But the announcement sparked strong backlash from the black community. Court finally went into session. John first presented the silver gun used to attack the officers. Then he displayed the photo of Mike holding a gun. Both guns had the exact same color and model. But the opposing lawyer, Emma, immediately denied it and the photo didn't prove that the gun Mike held was the murder weapon. She even pointed out that the helpful citizen was actually a graphic designer who edited videos for a living. Emma even played that same video in court, but in her version, the silver handgun was completely gone. Wait, there's no gun. Objection. That's not the video entered into evidence. That's because it's a fake. I had a graphic designer remove the silver flash just to prove how easy it is to manipulate the video. It took less Than an hour. This is completely improper and she knows it. Her argument was a bit far fetched, but the jury was starting to believe her. Next, it was Mike's turn to testify. He had already memorized the story Emma taught him. But John already saw through their plan. Before the hearing, he had figured out Mike's motive. It turned out Mike's uncle was shot dead by a white officer just one day before the incident at the exact same place where this case happened. Michael, look at me. Your girlfriend broke up with you because you weren't tough enough and your uncle whose life was ruined by a cop killed himself. He didn't walk down to the river over a breakup. He walked down there armed to the same location your uncle was arrested to prove you were tough to get revenge for your uncle. Objection, your honor. Sustain. The one just wanted an explanation. It was, it's that cops fault that he's dead. And you went down to the river to get revenge, didn't you? You went down there, Michael, to kill a cop. Objection. Right. Council's testify enough. Obviously, Mike lost this battle, but the story didn't end there. Higher UPS ordered John to reduce the charges against Mike.

In class, the teacher asked me to read aloud, and I said the letters were dancing. The teacher thought I was lying and forced me to read. Everyone was laughing at me. The teacher got angry and kicked me out of the classroom. But I wasn't lying. In my eyes, those letters were really dancing. My father was cruel and sent me to a boarding school. Watching my family walk away, I cried loudly. Classmates made fun of me and teacher scolded me for being stupid, even throwing chalk at me. I hid in the bathroom and cried hard, and I lost interest in food. One day, the art teacher handed everyone a blank piece of paper. The classmates all started creating. My paper was completely blank and this caught his attention. But he didn't scold me. He asked the students about my situation and went to look through my homework. After a long time, he silently looked up. The next day, he talked about a child who hated studying, tore up books and broke pencils. And then he asked everyone who this child was. The classmates all laughed. I panicked because he was talking about me. But the answer turned Out to be Albert Einstein. I was stunned. The teacher said that some people see the world differently, but they might be geniuses. I listened carefully and a long lost smile appeared on my face. From then on, the teacher patiently taught me every day, using drawing to help me recognize words. My smiles became more frequent. During outdoor class, all the students were playing. I inserted a pencil into a stick, use leaves for a sail, and built a small boat that could move on its own. Seeing the small boat in the water, the teacher LED the classmates in applauding me. My dad came to pick me up. He was still making fun of me. The teacher said that I only suffered from a disability, and seeing me so helpless, he burst into tears.

How can I assist you? Cooking, cleaning or in the bed? Austin was startled by the robot's behavior. He quickly explained that he bought her just for dating practice, then immediately showed the robot a photo of his girlfriend. Excellent choice. So I have never been on the real date, so I need to practice with you to avoid an impressive myself with her. They went to the place for their date. The robot praised Austin for his preparation, but when Austin asked her to rate his outfit, her answer wasn't what he wanted to hear. Cotton contain 97 DOT 5%. Excellent choice. Stop! Stop! You're acting like a robot, not like a real girl. Austin was looking sadly at Mary's photo, but the robot said she could imitate her. Austin was skeptical about that. Of course I can do this for you. Just connect me. We are Bluetooth. Austin connected Mary's data through Bluetooth. The robot instantly took on Mary's expressions and started commenting on Austin. What could I expect from the person who is wearing such old fashioned sweater? Imitating Mary's taste, the robot began criticizing Austin. Instead of being upset, Austin was actually happy. He took out his phone to record Mary's preferences and made changes. After some training, he finally won Mary's heart. I can't believe how much we have in common. I should be the one thanking you because. Because your smile makes all of this effort totally worth It. Seeing how much Austin had improved, Mary was very pleased with him. But what she did next completely caught him off guard. I can't wait for our next date. What are you doing? You want to kiss on the first date? Yeah. Something wrong? Since Austin had never practiced kissing, he made up an excuse to leave. She wants to kiss me. And we didn't practice that. I told you so. Okay, just show me. But while they were practicing kissing, Mary unexpectedly walked in on them. Oh, this? What did you run off to? To another girl. Let me explain. She's not a real woman. She's an android. Why do you have a female android? With no other choice, Austin confessed everything to Mary. He admitted he had never dated a girl before, so he bought the robot to practice. I'm sorry. You must hate me. Now I'm giving you a chance for a second date. But you need to show up as the real you. But the real me will show up in a stupid sweater. What makes you think that I don't like sweaters? Ha, ha

I was devastated, but tried to understand. The next morning, he came over with his parents. Instead of support, they handed me a folder containing receipts for all the wedding expenses they'd contributed. His mother coldly said, since you're canceling, we expect reimbursement.

That was the last time that happened. 2. One time my sister was hiding in my closet to wait for a bit until I was almost asleep so she could scare me. Unfortunately, she didn't know I was whacking it and she jumped out to scare me right as I came, which ended up go going all over her face and into her mouth. My mom heard the commotion and came into my room to investigate and after seeing me naked and my sister covered in my jizz got the wrong idea. Three, I had a closet sized single dorm room and people would always pull the fire alarm in the middle of the night and we'd all have to go outside. One time I was so drowsy I just walked out instinctively and halfway down the hall I raced back. Thankfully this was an old building so I didn't get locked out of the room or not me, but I was spending the night at my friend's house in a suburban neighborhood. In the middle of the night, his mom had let their toy fox terrier out to go pee and it got snatched by a coyote. She screamed and woke us all up. A wolf got noodle. Within 10 seconds his dad was sprinting. Out of the house completely butt ass naked with a Glock in his hand and went running down the street. Came back about 15 minutes later with the dog and obviously still completely naked. 5. I locked myself out of my flat whilst sleepwalking. My girlfriend was on holidays, so I had to wait until morning, borrow a towel off a neighbour and then walk about a mile up the road to the estate agent to get a spare key. 6. Never chased a burglar down the stairs, through the kitchen and out my front door without wearing a shred of clothing and no weapon in hand. The power of nakedness.

My son was diagnosed with a rare heart condition when he was 4. By the time he turned 7, he needed a specialized surgery that only one doctor in Boston could perform. The procedure cost $123,000 and our insurance denied coverage, calling it experimental. We'd already sold our house and moved into a tiny apartment. I was working two jobs while my husband took care of our son, whose condition was deteriorating rapidly. His lips would turn blue during even mild activity and he'd started having fainting spells. Last month, his cardiologist called us in for an emergency appointment. His heart was failing faster than they expected. If he doesn't get this surgery within three weeks, I don't think he couldn't finish the sentence, but we understood we were still $11,000 short. Despite the gofundme and community fundraisers, I picked up a third job at an upscale hotel bar in downtown Chicago, working overnight shifts after my day jobs. I was surviving on two to three hours of sleep, but nothing mattered except getting that money. On my fifth night, I was so exhausted I could barely stand. That's when Keanu Reeves walked in alone around 1 am he was in town filming, according to the local news. He wore simple clothes and looked tired. Sitting at the far end of the empty bar, I recognized him immediately but could see he wanted privacy. I just nodded. And asked, what can I get you? No name, no recognition. He ordered a whiskey neat and asked for the food menu while making his drink, my hands were shaking from exhaustion. I dropped a glass and it.

I was the maid of honor at my best friend Mia's wedding. When her future mother in law, Jennifer, stood up during the ceremony and announced she had something important to say. The entire church went silent. Mia's face went white. Jennifer walked to the front with this sick smile on her face and pulled out her phone. Before my son makes the big, biggest mistake of his life, everyone needs to see what kind of woman he's really marrying. She started playing a video on her phone, volume turned all the way up. It was Mia in a hotel room with another man in an inappropriate situation. The audio was crystal clear. Mia was sobbing, shaking her head, mouthing that's not me to her fiance Johnny. But the woman in the video looked exactly like her. Johnny's face went from confusion to rage in seconds. Is this real, Mia? Tell me this isn't real. Mia was hyperventilating, trying to speak, but nothing was coming out. Half the wedding guests were recording this with their phones. Her parents looked devastated. Jennifer was practically glowing with satisfaction. I hired a private investigator six months ago because I knew something was wrong with this girl. Johnny deserves better than a cheating woman. The church erupted in gasps and murmurs. Mia's grandmother had to be helped to her seat. That's when I noticed something. The time stamp on the video said last Tuesday. But I knew for a fact Mia was with me at my cousin's funeral in Portland last Tuesday. We drove there together and stayed in the same hotel room. I grabbed Jennifer's phone and looked closer. The woman in the video had a butterfly tattoo on her shoulder blade. Mia doesn't have any tattoos. I've known her since we were 12, and I've seen her in bathing suits hundreds of times. This video is fake, I announced loudly. Mia was with me in Portland when this was supposedly filmed, and she doesn't have that tattoo. But Jennifer snatched her phone back and started screaming about how I was just covering for my trashy friend. The private investigator was there in the back row. Jennifer called him up to verify his evidence. This greasy guy in a cheap suit walked up front and started explaining how he followed Mia to the hotel. But when I asked him which hotel, he said the

I didn't tell them. I just stopped paying. Two weeks later, Paige called, acting sweet, asking how we were settling in. I hung up on her. Three weeks after that, mom called frantic. The bank had contacted them about a missed payment. She asked if my account had issues. I said, no, mom, I'm just not paying anymore. Silence, then hysterical crying. She said they'd lose the house. I, I told her she threw her granddaughter on a porch like garbage and to ask Hage for money. Hage moved out four days later after one argument about dishes. By month 3, they were two payments behind. Dad called saying the stress was affecting his recovery, that I was going to cause another stroke. I told him he should have thought about that before choosing page over Sophia Sadie. Month 4, my brother called trying to play mediator. He said family is family and everyone makes mistakes. I asked if he'd pay their mortgage. She said that wasn't the point. I hung up. Last week, I drove past to grab mail that was still being sent there. There was a bright orange foreclosure notice taped to the door. Mom was sitting on the same porch steps where she'd left Sophia. She saw me and ran to my car sobbing, grabbing the door handle, begging me to come back. They'd made a terrible Mistake. They needed me. Dad came out looking smaller and older. He said I was still their daughter and family helps family through hard times. I looked at them, I said, you made your choice when you threw my daughter out like trash for page. You chose her feelings over your granddaughter's safety. That's not family. Mom screamed that I was vindictive and cruel, that I was punishing them over one mistake. One mistake. I looked her in the eyes. I paid your bills for three years and you left my 4 year old baby outside in winter. I drove away while mom collapsed crying in the driveway. I watched in my rearview mirror and felt nothing. They lost the house at auction three days ago. My brother told me they're living in his cramped basement now and he's already complaining about them being there. And Paige, she moved to Texas with some new boyfriend she met online. She hasn't called them even once since she left.

But when I stopped paying their mortgage, the house went into foreclosure and now they're begging for forgiveness. I'm 29 and I've been supporting my parents for three years after Dad's stroke left him unable to work. Every month I paid their 2,100 dollar mortgage while raising my four year old daughter Sophia alone in their guest room. When dad had his stroke, I moved in immediately and covered all their bills, more mortgage, property taxes, insurance, groceries, everything. I worked from home doing graphic design so I could take him to therapy appointments. Sophia and I lived in the guest room and we made it work. My sister Paige is 26 and has always been the golden child. She married rich, moved to California and barely called us during Dad's entire recovery. She never once offered to help with ills, not a single dollar. Three months ago, Paige's marriage fell apart. She called mom crying and within a week she was back with six designer suitcases. The first night I made dinner like always, Paige walked in, looked at Sophia's drawings covering the guest room walls and asked mom when we were moving out. She said she couldn't stay with a screaming kid. Sophia doesn't scream. She's the quietest four year old ever. Two days later, mom pulled me aside after breakfast. She, I said Paige needed stability and the guest room would be Better for her because it had the private bathroom. I asked where we'd go. Mom said maybe it was time I found my own apartment, that I should be more independent. I reminded her I'd paid their mortgage for three years straight. Dad actually said we let you live here rent free. I pulled up my bank statements and showed every 21 dollar payment, three years worth. Mom looked away. That night, I heard Paige complaining to mom about how uncomfortable she felt with us there. Mom promised to handle it soon. I asked for one week to find a place. On Day 5, I came home to all our stuff in garbage bags on the porch. Sophia was sitting on the steps crying in her pajamas. Mom had put her outside alone. She was 4 years old on a porch in February, Sophia asked why grandma didn't want us anymore. I had no answer. We drove to a Holiday Inn and I cried in the bathroom while she slept.

As everyone entered the house and we started to eat, my grandparents asked in surprise, honey, what happened to all the essentials we gave you for the baby when she was born? Before I could answer, my mother stood up and shouted in anger, what kind of food is this? And grabbed the plate and threw it across the room, hitting my Newborn baby's face. Then my sister walked in pushing a stroller, the one my grandparents had bought for my baby. My grandparents realized, wait, that's the stroller we gave you? I rushed to check on my baby, and my mother said coldly, oh, well, I think that baby might not make it. So everything belongs to her sister's baby now? Dad added, we already gave everything away. My grandfather stayed silent, deep in thought, while staring at them all, and what he did next made me truly proud. Mia was only three weeks old. The plate had shattered against her bassinet, cutting her tiny cheek. Blood soaked her blanket while she screamed. Vanessa stood there with my stroller, rubbing her pregnant belly like she'd won something. Grandpa walked to the door, picked up his coat. His voice was ice. Ruth, call 9 1 1! The baby needs medical attention! She's fine, mom snapped. My granddaughter is bleeding because you threw a plate at her. That's assault on an infant! I'm calling the Police? You can't be serious. Dad said an accident would involve remorse. I'm not seeing any. Grandpa looked at Vanessa. That stroller goes back within the hour, or I'm filing a theft report. You wouldn't, mom said. Try me. I want everything you stole returned. The crib, the clothes, the bottles, all of it. The paramedics documented Mia's injury. The police took photos of Vanessa refusing to return the stroller and filed a report for assault and theft. My parents left, screaming. After they left, Grandpa sat me down. How. How long has this been going on? I broke, told him everything. How mom had always compared me to Vanessa. How they'd stolen my spare key and had been taking things from my apartment for months. I thought I was going crazy. I whispered. Grandpa's jaw tightened. This ends now. Grandpa hired a lawyer and filed civil suits for theft and assault. But he went further.

You threw a plate that hit my great granddaughter in the face. You stole from your own daughter. You showed zero remorse. You don't deserve a single cent. What about Vanessa? Mom's voice cracked.

At the hearing, mom played the wounded mother, crying about how I was using my baby as a weapon. Then my lawyer presented the evidence. Photos of Mia's injury, the police report, the documented theft, Grandma Ruth's testimony. The judge granted a two year restraining order. Mom stood up, screaming, your poison. You've turned everyone against me. Security removed her. Three years later, Grandpa passed away. At the funeral, I found a letter he'd written the week he changed his will. Standing up for you and Mia was the easiest decision I ever made. You are strong, capable and loving. Be happy. Love Mia fiercely. Never let anyone make You feel less than you are. You are always enough. Mia, almost 4, hugged me as I cried. The inheritance let me finish my degree and buy a house. What Grandpa really gave me was showing that family isn't about blood. It's about who stands up when it matters. Mia is 10 now. She asks sometimes about my parents. I tell her that sometimes people aren't capable of being what we need. And that's okay, because we have people who genuinely love us. The scar on her face faded to a faint line, but I know it's there. A reminder of where we came from, how far we've traveled. And how Grandpa made sure we didn't just survive. We thrived.

The properties, the accounts, the house. Wesley's face went white. Aunt Linda, I don't understand. I've been visiting you every month. I drove you to your appointments, I. You drove me because your mother told you to. Linda cut him off. You visited because you wanted my money. You never once asked how I was actually feeling. Not once she turned to me. But you. You called me every Sunday for three years, even when your own mother wouldn't speak to you. You flew out when I had my hip surgery and slept on my couch for a week. You sent me flowers on my birthday when these people couldn't even remember the date. My mom stood up. This is manipulation. You're dying, and you're not thinking clearly. We'll contest this. Linda smiled. I hoped you'd say that. My lawyer is also here tonight, two tables behind you. He's been documenting everything. A man in a gray suit raised his wine glass slightly. Wesley knocked his chair over, leaving. My parents followed, my mother already crying. Linda reached across the table and squeezed my hand. Happy birthday to me, she said. We ordered dessert. She had eight months left. I made sure she spent every single one of them loved.

No, mom said if anyone calls the police, they'll take me away. She said I'd go to a bad place where kids get hurt. I'm shaking. Maya, that's not true. Keys jingle at the front door. We both freeze. Girl, girls, I'm home. Maya's crying now, terrified. Please don't tell. Please. I'll be good. I'll never show anyone again. Mom's footsteps echo through the kitchen, getting closer. I have seconds. I text my boyfriend. Call police to my address. Now. Mom holding people. Send help. Hit send, delete the message. Pick up my phone like nothing happened. Mom appears in the doorway, shopping bags in hand. Her smile doesn't reach her eyes. What are you two doing back here? Maya runs to her. Nothing. Mommy just playing. Mom's eyes lock on mine. She knows somehow. She knows. Sweetie, why don't you go start your homework, mom says to Maya. Voice sugar sweet. I need to talk to your sister. Maya scurries upstairs. Mom sets down the bag slowly. You went outside. It's not a question. I don't know what you're talking about. She steps closer. Maya showed you. My back hits the wall. Mom, I've given you everything, private tutoring, a car, college savings. Do you know what that costs? You're keeping people prisoner. I'm Providing opportunity. Her voice is calm. Ice cold. Those people had nothing, no papers, no future. I give them work, shelter, food. They're better off here than on the streets. You lock them in a shed. I protect them. And this family. Sirens distant but growing louder. Mom's face goes white. What did you do? The sirens are close now, right outside. She grabs my arm, desperate. You've destroyed everything. They'll take Maya. They'll take you. We'll lose the house. Red and blue lights flood through the windows. Mom's grip titans. Why couldn't you just stay quiet? Police found Carmen and the man locked inside. Both were undocumented immigrants mom had hired through a cleaning service, then imprisoned. Rose's body was discovered buried near the shed. Mom and dad are awaiting trial. Maya's with my aunt. I testified against them both.

When I asked where she Learned that, she whispered. It's how mom decides who has to sleep outside. My seven year old sister Maya has 12 dolls arranged in a perfect row on her bedroom floor. She's holding a clipboard asking each one questions in this serious voice. Do you have references? Can you work weekends? I laugh. What are you playing? She doesn't look up interviewing them like Mommy does some. Something about her tone makes me uneasy. Mom interviews dolls, not dolls. Maya points to her closet. The people. My stomach drops. What people? She walks to her closet, opens it. There's a door I've never noticed before or behind our house, Maya explains. When they don't answer right, they have to sleep in the shed. I'm frozen. We don't have a shed. Show me. We go downstairs. Mom's at the grocery store. Dad's at work. Maya leads me to the back door, points through the window. There's a small structure behind our fence I always thought was abandoned from the previous owner. Through the dusty window, I see blankets, pillows, a space heater, food wrappers, a bucket in the corner. Mom brings them water on Tuesdays, Maya says. The nice ones get to come inside sometimes to clean my phone. I need my phone. But Maya grabs my hand. Don't tell Mommy I showed you, she said. It's our special secret. The people who tell get Sent away forever. I crouch down. Maya, has mom ever hurt you? She shakes her head. Only the people who don't work good enough work. My brain clicks. How many people his mom brought here? Maya counts on her fingers. Rosa was first, then Miguel, then the quiet lady. Now it's just Carmen and the man with the cross necklace. Five people. My mother has kept five people in our backyard. Where did Rosa go? Maya's face goes sad. She got too sick. Mom said she had to leave in the middle of the night. I feel like I'm going to throw up. When was this before my birthday? January. January. That's when mom started her consulting business from home, when she suddenly had money for Maya's private school. For my college fund, for the kitchen renovation. I grabbed Maya's shoulders. Where's Carmen right now? In there. The man, too. Mom locks it when she goes shopping so they don't leave before she pays them. Locks them. Maya, does dad know? She nods. Daddy.

They were trying to get you to go to the basement. So I made a decision. Every night I would cover your ears so you couldn't hear them, so they couldn't call you. I put the letter down. My sister had been protecting me from voices trying to lure me to the basement. But why? What was in that room? What did they want with me? I picked up the letter again. There was more. I did this every night for three years until I turned 18 and moved away for college. I thought maybe the voices would stop once I was gone. But I was wrong. Last month I went back to the house while you were at work. I had to know if that room was still there. My heart was pounding. The door was unlocked. This time I went down the stairs, the room was exactly the same, except now there were new photos, recent photo of you as an adult. And the writing on the wall had changed. It said, Day 9, 1:25. He is ready. Collection begins soon. 9,025 days. I calculated that was exactly my current age in days. I tried to destroy the room. I ripped the photos off the walls. I tried to scrub away the symbols. But when I turned to leave, the door was closed and I heard the voices. They said, you interfered, now you pay the price. The letter ended there, just stopped mid sentence. I immediately drove to my childhood home. My parents had moved out years ago and the house had been empty ever since. I had a key. I went straight to the basement to the locked door. It was open, just slight. I pushed it open and saw the staircase going down. I counted as I descended, 47 steps, just like Emma said. At the bottom was the room. The symbols were still on the walls. The circle was still on the floor, but the photos were gone, except for one. In the center of the circle was a photo of me taken today. I was getting into my car outside Emma's funeral. I hadn't seen anyone take that photo. Written below it, Day 9, 1:25, collection complete, transfer initiated. I heard footsteps on the stairs behind me, slow and heavy, coming down. I turned to run, but the door at the top slammed shut. The voices started, hundreds of them, all around me coming from the walls. They were saying my name over and over. And then I heard Emma's voice clear and distinct. I'm sorry. I tried to protect you, but now I understand the voices weren't trying to take you. They were trying to warn you. Someone in our family made a deal and you're the payment. You always were. I looked at the walls. The symbol started glowing faint red light. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. The footsteps reached the bottom of the Stairs, I turned around and saw who was standing there. It was my father, but his eyes were completely black and he was smiling. He said, I've been waiting 32 years for this. The deal is finally complete. He reached for me, and the last thing I heard was Emma's voice whispering, I'm so sorry. I couldn't say.

I now know the disgusting reason why. When I was 7 years old, my older sister, Emma, started sneaking into my room every night. She'd wait until I was asleep, then she'd press her hands over my ears and hold them there for hours. I'd wake up sometimes and ask what she was doing. She'd always say the same thing, I'm protecting you. Go back to sleep. I never understood what she meant, but every morning she'd be gone and my ears would ache. This went on for three years, every single night from age 7 to 10. And suddenly it stopped. Emma moved away to college and I never saw her do it again. I'm 32 now. Emma died last week in a car accident. At the funeral, my aunt pulled me aside and said, your sister asked me to give you this if anything happened to her. She handed me a sealed envelope. Inside was a letter in Emma's handwriting. If you're reading this, I'm gone. And now you need to know the truth about why I covered your ears all those years. I wasn't protecting you from something outside. I was protecting you from something inside our house, something that only came out at night. My hands started shaking. I kept reading, when you were 7, I started hearing voices at night, not from outside, from the walls, from the floor, from the ceiling. They were whispering hundreds Of voices all talking at once. I couldn't understand what they were saying, but I knew they were talking about you. I, Emma had never mentioned hearing voices. I went to mom and dad, but they said I was dreaming. They said I was making it up for attention. But I knew what I heard. And the voices got louder every night. They were saying your name over and over, like they were calling you. The letter continued. One night I followed the voices. They LED me to the basement, to the door that's always locked, the door dad told us never to open. I found the key in his desk and I opened it. I remembered that door. It was in the corner of the basement behind some old boxes. I'd asked my parents about it when I was a kid, but I said it was just story. Behind the door was a staircase going down, way down. I counted 47 steps before I reached the bottom. And what I found there made me understand why the voices wanted you. I stopped reading. I didn't want to know, but I forced myself to continue. There was a room, a big room with symbols painted on the walls. And in the center was a circle drawn in something dark, something that looked like dried blood. Inside the circle were photos, dozens of them, all of you from the day you were born until that week. Someone had been taking photos. Of you your entire life. My stomach turned. I kept reading. I looked closer and saw writing under the photos, dates. And next to each date was a number. I didn't understand what they meant until I saw the last photo. It was from that morning. And next to it was written day 2, 5:57. Final phase begins tonight, 20, 500, 57 days. I did the math. That would have been right around the time I turned 7. I ran upstairs and that's when I realized what the voices were doing. They were trying to call you down.

Three years ago, I refused to lie for my brother when he crashed my parents car drunk. He told them it was stolen. I told them the truth. Since then, I've been the family villain. But that wasn't even the real reason they cut me off. See, when the police investigated the stolen car, they found something else. My brother had been driving home from his girlfriend's apartment, except his girlfriend was actually my fiance. They've been seeing each other for 8 months behind my back. When I confronted my parents about it, my mom said I needed to forgive and move on, that Wesley was young and made a mistake, that I was being dramatic and ruining family harmony over a man, the man I was supposed to marry in three months. My dad handed me back my engagement ring and told me to return it quietly. Don't make a scene. Don't embarrass Wesley. He's got a future, law school applications, important things. I returned to the ring, then I returned myself, moved four States away, changed my number, deleted everything, no Thanksgiving invites, no Christmas, not even a text when I got diagnosed with Lupus last year and spent two weeks in the hospital alone. But Linda never stopped calling me. She's the one who taught me to drive, helped me move into my first apartment, co signed my student loans when my parents wouldn't. She flew out when I was hospitalized and sat with me every single day. She held my hand when the doctors explained I'd be managing this disease for the rest of my life. So when she asked me to come to her 60th birthday, I said yes. What I didn't know was that Linda had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer six months ago.

When did you realise you were living in a bubble and not like everyone else? I thought every kid had their birthdays planned by event coordinators. Until I was 13, every April, my parents would rent out country clubs or these fancy rooftop venues downtown. They'd hire magicians, ice cream trucks, face painters, and once even this guy who brought parrots that could talk. I'm talking like 60 kids from school showing up, tables covered in those fancy cloth things, waiters walking around with little appetizers on trays. But here's the weird part. None of the kids ever stayed long. Like they'd show up, eat some cake, watch the magic show for maybe an hour, then their parents would collect them and they'd leave. And nobody ever brought me actual presents, just these white envelopes that my mom would grab and stuff into her purse before I could even see what was inside. I didn't think it was strange back then. I figured that's just how birthdays worked. The envelopes probably had money or gift cards or something, right? And maybe other kids just had smaller parties because their parents weren't as organised as mine. Then in 7th grade, this kid, Jake, from my math class, invited me to his birthday party. I was actually pretty excited because Jake was cool and I wanted to be friends with him. My mom dropped me off at this public park and I was confused because there was No ballet or anything, just regular parking spots. When I found Jake's party, my brain basically short circuited. There was one folding table with a plastic tablecloth, hot dogs cooking on this little portable grill and a cooler full of sodas. No servers, no fancy decorations, just balloons tied to the table legs. And get this, there was one soccer ball. That was it for entertainment. But all the kids were laughing their heads off. They were playing tag, kicking the soccer ball around and having these intense conversations about video games and t V shows. Everyone had wrapped presents, actual gifts and colourful paper with ribbons and stuff. Jake opened each one and got genuinely excited about things like Pokemon cards and a new skateboard. The party lasted four hours. Four hours. And nobody wanted to leave. Parents had to literally drag their kids away because it was.

Can someone please tell me what I supposedly did? The landlord pulled up a video on his phone, turned it toward me.

Then crashing sounds, things breaking, more screaming. My stomach dropped. That wasn't me. I was at work yesterday at two PM your door, your apartment. My landlord said, check my work. Schedule, call my supervisor. I wasn't here. The officer checked something on his phone. Your workplace confirms you clocked in at 11:00am and didn't leave until eight PM the landlord frowned. And who was screaming in your apartment? I don't know. Did anyone see who went in or out? No. But the screaming happened three times this week. Always from your unit? Always around two PM when you're supposedly at work. My upstairs neighbor, Missus Rodriguez appeared in my doorway. I heard it too. Yesterday, the day before, last Friday, a woman screaming for help. But I work every day at those times. I said desperately, maybe you have someone staying with you. The officer suggest.

Until one year, he finally broke down and asked why. When I was 12, Uncle Vincent showed up to Christmas with a gift bag for me. Everyone gathered around as I opened it. A motivational book called Losers Who Became Winners. He grinned at the whole family. Figured you could use some inspiration since your grades are so bad. My face burned red while everyone laughed nervously. I got straight b's. The next year, he handed me another gift. Here's something practical for once. Inside was a gym membership card. You're getting a little chunky there, buddy. Better start now before it's too late. I was 13 and barely 110 pounds. Year three, he gave my older sister, Rebecca, a gift, too. She opened it in front of everyone. A pregnancy test? Just making sure you're prepared, he said. Wink with all those boyfriends you've been through. Rebecca was 19 and had been dating the same guy for two years. She ran upstairs crying. That's when I started keeping a list in my phone. Every insult, every cruel gift. Every time someone in my family looked hurt. And nobody said anything. Christmas 4, I gave Uncle Vincent Dollar store reading glasses. Thought you needed help seeing things clearly. You keep mistaking normal people for problems that need fixing. My mom covered her mouth. Dad looked away, shoulder shaking. Very cute, Uncle Vincent said. Tossing them aside. Then he handed me a book about basic social skills. Since you clearly don't know how to respect your elders. Year five, I gave him glasses again. Purple frames this time. He gave me a scale. Year six, he tried to be subtle. He gave me a gift card to a bookstore with a note, maybe you'll finally read something worthwhile. I just gotten accepted to three colleges with academic scholarships. I gave him green glasses. By year 7, the whole family knew the pattern. When I handed him his gift, he didn't even open it. Just set it aside and said, another pair of cheap glasses? How original. Then he turned to my cousin David, who just come out to the family three months earlier. Uncle Vincent handed him a DVD set. Thought you might need to watch some real men. Maybe it'll help straighten things out. David's mom grabbed her son and left immediately. Half the family followed them out. My dad finally spoke up.

We want you gone tonight. When I agreed and stopped paying for everything, they, you've been controlling us long enough, my mother announced over dinner, her words slightly slurred from her third glass of wine. Dad nodded beside her, his bloodshot eyes avoiding mine entirely. My little sister, Yarabelle, stopped eating immediately. At 11, she'd gotten used to their erratic behavior, but this was different. Controlling you. I kept my voice level, though my stomach dropped. Don't play innocent, dad finally spoke. I recognized this pattern. They needed money again. We know you've been intercepting our paychecks, hiding our bank cards, treating us like children who can't manage their own money. The accusation was so backwards, I almost laughed. I've been cashing their occasional checks and using every penny for rent and groceries before they could gamble it away. My warehouse job barely covered the rest, but somehow I'd managed to keep us housed and Yarabelle fed. You monitor every dollar we spend, mom continued, gaining confidence. We're grown adults, but you act like our parent, deciding what we can and can't buy. We're done being controlled by our own son. You're 22, Dad added, want you gone. By morning, Yarabelle's eyes went wide and she grabbed my arm under the table. Unless, dad added, you give us access to your bank accounts for the emotional damage you caused. They wanted my savings, the emergency fund I'd scraped together for Yarabelle. And me, I made my choice. I'll be gone by morning, I said quietly. I packed that night while they celebrated downstairs, popping open a bottle of champagne they've been saving for a special occasion. Yarabell helped me carry boxes to my car. Tears streaming down her face. I slipped her a cheap phone I bought weeks ago, telling her to hide it and only use it for emergencies. You're coming back, right, she whispered. I couldn't answer that honestly, so I just hugged her tight. The next morning, they were already making plans. My friend's couch. I watched their social media explode with excitement. Finally free to live our lives, mom posted, along with a selfie of them holding plane tickets. Day 1 in Vegas, they posted everything. The welcome drinks at the casino, the fancy steakhouse dinner, dad throwing dice at the craps table. Beginner's luck, he captioned a photo of a small pile of chips. Day 2 brought more victories. Mom hit three cherries on the slots. Dad posted a video from a poker table, stacks of chips growing in front of him. Should have done this years ago, he wrote. Their friends commented with congratulations and fire emojis. Yarabell texted me that night. They said three days back, Sunday. By day 4, the posts got bigger. VIP room access, bottle service at some club. A photo of them in matching silk robes at the hotel spa. Living like we deserve, mom captioned it. They'd extended their Stay hot street continues. Day 5, 6, 7, the posts kept coming. Expensive shows, helicopter tours, more casino floors. Yarabelle's texts changed. Running low on food. When are they coming back? Day 8 was quieter, just one photo of a poker table, no caption. Day 9, nothing. Day 10, Yarabelle called me crying there.

Fine, I'll eat something normal. So my roommate Jake has this thing where he gets all pissy about me eating at night. Like, dude, I work 10 hour shifts at the warehouse and don't get home until 11 most nights. Sorry if my grilled cheese and leftover pizza bothers your precious sleep schedule. Last Tuesday I got home around my usual time, starving because I skipped lunch to cover for this guy who called out sick. I was exhausted, feet killing me. Just wanted to make something quick and pass out. I opened the fridge and saw we had some leftover Chinese takeout from the weekend, so I figured I'd heat that up. But as I'm pulling containers out comes stomping out of his room in his stupid Batman pajama pants all dramatic like I just murdered someone. He goes, really? You're gonna be loud in the kitchen again? Some of us have real jobs that start early. Real jobs? This dude works at a bank and strolls in at 9:30. I've been up since 5:00am loading trucks. I told him I was just heating up some lo Mein, would take like two minutes. He rolled his eyes and said why can't you eat normal food at normal times like a normal person? All this weird late night stuff is ridiculous. Weird late night stuff? It was leftover Chinese food. Not exactly strange, but fine. He wants normal food at Normal times. I can do normal. The next morning I woke up at 4:30 instead of my usual 5:15. Went straight to the kitchen and started making breakfast. Real breakfast. Bacon, eggs, hash Browns, toast. The works. Used every pan we owned. Really let that bacon sizzle nice and loud. Jake's room shares a wall with the kitchen. Around 5 a. M. I heard his alarm go off. Then I heard it go off again. And again. Dude kept hitting snooze while I'm out here clanging pans around flipping hash Browns. You know, making normal breakfast food at a normal breakfast time. By the third news alarm, I was really getting into it. Started humming while I cooked. Dropped a few pans on accident. Had to check on those hash Browns every 30 seconds to make sure they weren't burning. Finally heard him get up around 5:30. He stumbled out looking like he got hit by a truck, hair sticking up everywhere, squinting at me like I was some kind of alien. What the hell are you doing? I smiled real big and said, making normal food at a normal time. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, right? He just stood there for a minute trying to process what was happening. I could see his brain working trying to figure out if he could complain about me cooking breakfast

My best friend Vanessa has been dead for three years, but I still text her phone every single day. It started the week after her funeral. I was completely wrecked, barely functional. Vanessa and I had been inseparable since middle school. She was the sister I never had. We talked every day for 12 years straight. The night after we buried her, I was drunk off cheap wine and scrolling through our old text conversations without thinking. I typed I can't believe you're gone and hit send to her number. My phone buzzed immediately. Who is this? I froze. Someone else had her number now. I quickly explained about Vanessa, how she'd passed away in a car accident, how I texted without thinking. The response came 20 minutes later. I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm Aaron. If texting this number helps you grieve, please don't stop because of me. So I didn't stop. Every morning at 7:30 a m, exactly when Vanessa and I used to exchange our daily Good Morning, beautiful texts, I'd send updates to her number. Got the promotion at work today. You always said I'd make manager before 25. Went on another terrible tinder date. Remember how you used to screen my matches? Mom's asking when I'm bringing someone home for Christmas again. Wish you were here to be my girlfriend. Like senior year. Aaron never responded to these messages. For two years. I just sent them into the Void. Treating it like my personal diary. Sometime I'd send photos of sunsets or my coffee. Things Vanessa would have loved. I told that number about every breakup, every family fight, every small victory. My other friends thought I was crazy when they found out. It's been two years. They'd say, you need to move on. But they didn't understand. Those daily texts were the only thing keeping me connected to her. Then last month, everything fell apart at one

Well, someone needs to watch Rusty, she said, gesturing to their elderly golden retriever sleeping in the corner. You don't mind, right? You're already here. The room had gone back to chattering about the vacation. No one was looking at us. No one cared. Wait. You begged me to drive six hours so I could dog sit? Don't be dramatic. It's not just dog sitting. You'll have the whole house to yourself. You can relax, catch up on sleep. You always say you need a break. My sister walked by, suitcase already in hand. Thanks for doing this, she said without stopping. I was worried we'd have to cancel. That's when it clicked. This was planned. They'd coordinated this whole thing. Get me here under the pretense of a reunion, then drop the dog sitting bomb once I'd already made the trip. How long is the vacation? I asked quietly. Just 10 days, mom said. Rusty's on medication. Three times a day. Schedules on the fridge. Oh, and he needs his special food. Don't give him table scraps. 10 days? They wanted me to drop everything for 10 days. I have work, I said. You work remotely? She chirped. See? Perfect solution. I looked around the room at my family, all excited about their vacation, none of them considering that maybe, just maybe, this was wildly disrespectful. My dad was already loading suitcases into the car. I walked over to Rusty and sat down next to him. He opened One eye, gave a half hearted tail wag, then went back to sleep. Sweet dog. Didn't deserve to be used as bait. I stood up, grabbed my keys, and headed for the door. Where are you going? Mom called home. But what about Rusty? I turned around. I'm sure one of the family members going on the family vacation can stay behind and take care of him. Or you could board him. Or here's an idea. You could have asked me to dog sit instead of manipulating me into driving six hours. You're being ridiculous. My dad said, have a great trip. I replied. I made it to my car before my phone started buzzing. Texts, calls, voicemails. How could I do this? I was ruining everything. I was being selfish. I blocked them all, started the engine, and drove home. Six hours back. But this time, I was smiling. Rusty's fine, by the way. They canceled the vacation.

She was threatening legal action for stopping payments on debts that were legally theirs. I hired a lawyer. Jennifer reviewed everything and smiled with steel in her eyes. Your mother doesn't have a case if she pursues this. We'll counter sue for financial abuse. We'll expose every transfer, every guilt trip, every manipulative text. We'll make this so ugly, she'll wish she never picked up the phone. Two weeks before the wedding, the mortgage payment bounced. My credit dropped 30 points. The Tesla payment bounced. Next day, another hit. Then Jennifer discovered something. My mother had been making minimum payments with my money while telling relatives she was reporting her ungrateful daughter through hard times. She'd been using my financial abuse to play the martyr. My mother's lawyer withdrew from the case after realizing she'd been lying to him. My father called. Where did all the money go, dad? I asked. I paid $150,000. Where is it? Silence! Your mother has expectations, he finally said. About how we should live. The trips, the furniture, the club memberships. She says we've earned it. You could start by making your own payments, I said softly. You could start by being my dad instead of her accomplice. He hung up. My mother showed up at my bridal shower disheveled and desperate. Please, she begged in front of everyone. We need to talk. You need to leave, I said. When she wouldn't, Emily called the police. The wedding, Was perfect. My mother didn't come. Neither did my father. Their absence felt like the first honest thing they'd given me in years. Three months later, Jennifer emailed. Your parents house went into foreclosure. The Tesla was repossessed. Your mother attempted to open a credit card in your name. I filed identity theft reports. Six months later, my father called from Nevada. I left. I'm divorcing her. I wanted to say I'm sorry. Not just for the money. For not being your dad. A year after the wedding, I saw my mother at the grocery store. She looked like someone who'd been surviving instead of living. I'm sorry, she said. You were right about everything. I destroyed the best thing in my life because I couldn't stand not being the center of your world. I can't be part of your healing journey? I reply. Not right now. Maybe not ever. She nodded. You look happy. That's all I ever should have wanted for you. My credit recovered. John and I bought our own house. My father and I talk once a month. Brief, honest conversations. My mother stood up at my rehearsal dinner and tried to destroy him. Instead, she freed me. And I've never looked back.

I was hurt, but honestly, I was more angry that she didn't just tell me the truth. I focused on work, picked up extra shifts, started saving money for a house. My boss offered me a supervisor position with a big raise. I took a welding certification course on weekends to specialize in underwater welding, which pays even more. Three months after the breakup, I bought a 4 closed house in a nice neighborhood. It needed work, but I could fix most of it myself. New floors, updated kitchen, completely redid the master bathroom. I posted progress pictures on my Instagram because I was proud of the work. That's when Jessica started watching all my stories. She started liking my posts. Then she sent me a message saying the house looked amazing and asking how I was doing. I left her on read. A week later, she texted saying she made a huge mistake. The Derek turned out to be a jerk who only cared about himself. He dumped her at parties to network with his finance buddies, made her split every Bill down to the penny, even asked her to help pay for his car payment because he was bad with money. Despite the fancy job, Jessica said her friends were wrong about me, that she was wrong about me. Could we meet up and talk? I thought about it for maybe 5 seconds then typed back, no thanks, I'm good. She kept texting and she realised I was the one all along that material things don't matter, that she loved me and wanted to fix things. I finally called her and said, you didn't want to break. You wanted to trade up. Now that your backup plan crashed, you think you can just come back. That's not how this works. She started crying, saying she was young and stupid and influenced by her friends. I told her those friends would still be in her life, still judging her choices, still making her feel like she settled. I wasn't going to be someone's backup plan or second choice. My new neighbor, Kelly, had been helping me pick out paint colors for the living room. She was a teacher, thought it was cool that I could build and fix things. We've been grabbing coffee on Saturday mornings after I finished work on the house. Nothing serious yet, but it felt easy and real. She never once made me feel like I wasn't enough. Last week, Jessica showed up at my house unannounced, saw Kelly's car in the driveway and me showing her the deck I just built. Jessica just stood there on the sidewalk staring, then got back in her car and left. I got one final text from her that night saying she understood and hoped I'd be happy. I deleted the message and got back to planning the housewarming party. Turns out being a welder who owns his own house, And knows his worth is pretty great, actually.

My father said, don't listen to them, they're liars. But Nora said he ties our hands behind our backs. He's been doing it for four years. The hospital called the police immediately. The doctors found severe nerve damage, dislocated shoulders, torn ligaments and permanent loss of function in several fingers. One doctor looked at my X rays and started crying. My father told the police, this is normal. They're lying about the severity. Child services put us in foster care while they investigated. My father hired his brother, who is a doctor, to write fake medical reports saying our injuries were from a genetic disorder. He submitted these to child services and demanded we be he returned to him. Our case worker called and said, your father has medical evidence that contradicts your story. We're reconsidering custody. I said, he's lying. Please don't send us back. She said, we'll schedule a hearing. Two weeks later, my father brought my mother to our foster home to prove we were lying. When she walked through the door, her hands were tied behind her back. She was crying and her shoulders were visibly dislocated. She said, girls, please tell them the truth. Tell them you made this up. I stared at her and said, mom, what did he do to you? She said, I'm choosing this to show proper submission. Our foster mother said, your hands are tied. How is that A choice. My father said she's demonstrating that our family's practices are voluntary. But my mother was shaking from pain and could barely stand. Our foster father called the police immediately. When the officers arrived, one of them said, ma'am, are you being held against your will? My mother tried to say no, but started sobbing. The officer said to my father, untie her hands right now. My father said, this is a private family matter. The officer said, this is criminal abuse and arrested him on the spot. My father went to prison for child abuse. My mother eventually testified against him and admitted he'd forced her to come with tied hands. Child services gave her a choice between leaving him or losing custody permanently. She chose him. I had three surgeries but still can't lift my arms above my head. I haven't spoken to either parent since.

She'd been specifically positioned as her mentor by our director. They worked closely together on every major account. Courtney knew everything about her, her routines, her insecurities, her habits. I pulled Courtney into my office an hour later. She immediately went defensive, crossing her arms and saying it was just a basic white girl costume and the name tag was completely random. Beatrix is a normal name, she insisted. There's probably thousands of Beatrices in America, but I'd already checked. I asked HR to pull Courtney's access logs from our system and three weeks before Halloween, she'd requested Beatrix's employee file. She'd also accessed the company directory to view Beatrix's profile photo four times that week, all at odd hours, midnight, 2:00am. When I confronted her with the time stamps, Courtney's expression changed complete. The fake confusion vanished. I was just looking, she said flatly. No emotion. That's not illegal. I suspended her pending a full investigation. That afternoon, Beatrix called in sick. I texted her asking if she was okay, telling her to take whatever time she needed. She read the message at three fourteen PM but didn't respond. Day two, nothing. Her calls went straight to voicemail. Day three, her mother called me at 6 a. And her voice was frantic, breaking, have you seen Beatrice? She didn't come home last night. She's not answering anyone. Her roommate hasn't seen her since yesterday morning. They filed a missing person report. That evening at the sheriff station. By day 4, police found her car at Cold Water Canyon Trail about 40 minutes from our office. Keys still in the ignition, phone on the passenger seat, battery dead. Her last text to her mother sent at eleven fifty three PM on day 2. I can't do this anymore. I'm so sorry for everything. They've been searching the woods for 3 days now. Search and rest you teams, tracking dogs, Thermal drones, volunteers from our office. Nothing. Just her footprints leading into the forest and disappearing near the creek. Courtney's lawyer sent our company a cease and desist yesterday claiming we're harassing his client and creating a hostile work environment for her. My boss, the same one who voted for Courtney's costume, pulled me aside this morning and told me to drop the entire investigation. We can't prove anything, he said, and we're opening ourselves up to a massive lawsuit. I keep thinking about Beatrix sitting in my office with her hands shaking, twisting that silver ring, how small her voice sounded when she said I trusted her. How Courtney's face went completely cold when I mentioned those midnight access logs. The search team is going out again tomorrow at dawn. I'm going with them this time. I should have been there for Halloween.

But true friends adapt, she said, raising her glass. That's when I stood up. Speaking of adapting, I said, I have something to share. I pulled out my phone, connected it to the bar's TV system that the manager had graciously let me access an hour earlier. Before we toast to friendship, I thought everyone should see this. The security footage played on the giant screen. Rachel's hand extending cash, the stylist nodding, Rachel checking that I wasn't watching. The whole bar went silent. Three hundred dollars. I to the room. That's what Rachel paid to have my hair chopped off before my wedding. The salon manager confirmed it. The stylist confessed. When confronted with the footage, Rachel's face went from confused to panicked to furious in seconds. That's not. You're misunderstanding what you're seeing, she started. The stylist admitted everything. Rachel. She still had the exact bills in her wallet. Three hundred dollar bills. The other women started murmuring. My cousin Amy stood up. You sabotaged her hair on purpose before her wedding. Rachel tried to defend herself. It wasn't sabotage. I thought she'd look better with short hair, more sophisticated. That long hair was aging her. I was doing her a favor. My sister laughed. Not a nice laugh. You paid someone behind her back to do something you knew she didn't want, and you think that's a favor? Rachel turned to me. You're being so dramatic about this. It's just hair. It grows back. You're right. I said it does grow back. But trust doesn't. And neither does friendship after someone shows you who they really are. The room was staring at Rachel. Now she tried one more defense. I've been your best friend for 12 years. I've always looked out for you. No, I said. You've been threatened by me for 12 years. Every time something good happened in my life, you found a way to taint it. But you smiled through it all. Hugged me through the pain you caused. Made me think you were my safety net, when really, you were the one pushing me off the cliff. I turned back to the group. Rachel's not invited to my wedding anymore. She's not my maid of honor. She's not my friend. And I wanted all. All of you to know exactly why so she can't spin this story later. Rachel grabbed her purse and ran out. Half the women followed her to the parking lot, not to comfort her, but to make sure she left. My sister took over the party, ordered champagne, made a new toast about real friendship and karma. The wedding was flawless until the reception, when James's best man pulled me aside with a confession. Rachel had contacted him weeks before, begging him to convince James to call off the wedding.

It started the day my father caught me brushing my hair in front of the bathroom mirror a few weeks before he joined a group that he told us was for men's empowerment. He grabbed my wrist and said, what are you doing? I said, just brushing my hair. He said, you're being vain. Women's hands are instruments of sin. He made me and my sister Nora stand in the living room while he got rope from the garage. He said, from this day forward, all daughters in this house will keep their hands bound behind their backs. It will teach you humility and keep you from temptation. My mother stood next to him and said, your father knows what's best. My father used thick rope that he tied tight enough to hurt our wrists. We had to sleep with our hands tied. We had to eat with our hands tied. We had to do all our chores with our hands tied. The first day, I tried to wash dishes by holding the sponge in my mouth. My father watched and said, maybe now you'll appreciate how easy you had it before cooking became impossible. I had to lean over the stove and use my face to push pots around. I burned my cheek trying to stir soup. Nora dropped a pot of boiling water and scolded her legs because she couldn't catch it. My father said, you're Clumsy. You need more practice. My brothers were allowed to keep their hands free and would watch us struggle while eating dinner at the table. They'd laugh when we dropped things or burned ourselves. My father encouraged it and said how pathetic females are without men to guide them. Within a month, my shoulders were in constant pain. My wrists bled where the rope cut into them, and my father would re tie the bindings over the wounds. Nora developed nerve damage in her arms and started losing feeling in her fingers. She said, dad, I can't feel my hands anymore. He said, good. That means you're not thinking about using them for sinful purposes. My mother helped him enforce the rules. When I begged her to untie me, just for an hour, she said, you're being selfish. Your father knows what's best. We weren't allowed to leave the house. My father pulled us out of school and said seeing other women with free hands would corrupt you. Simple things like opening doors became impossible. We had to ram them with our shoulders or push them with our heads. I developed infections in my shoulders from the constant strain. Nora's hands turned purple from lack of circulation, and her fingers curled into claws. My father said, this is proof that women's hands were meant to be useless. When I was 16, I collapsed in the kitchen. My shoulder had finally given out completely. I heard something pop. I couldn't move My arm and the pain was so severe I vomited. Nora screamed, mom, help! Something's wrong! My father said she's faking to get sympathy. When I still couldn't get up after two hours, my mother finally called an ambulance.

My boss Joseph wasn't bluffing about the no workplace dating policy. Anyone caught dating got fired immediately. That couple from the business department? Fired. Mr. And Mrs. Wolowitz divorced. Even my friend Sasha got transferred to another branch for carpooling with another guy to work. If anyone was caught, even just talking for more than five minutes, they'd get called to his office to get lectured. So things were pretty rough in the office. A few people did try to reason with him, but he refused to budge. Workplace romances hurt productivity, he'd say. But everyone knew he was just bitter about the messy divorce with his secretary wife. So now we were all suffering. I'd always been careful about that rule until I met Lance. From it. That day, I was completely panicking. I'd worked all night for an important project, only for my laptop to freeze. One hour before the meeting, Lance came over from the fourth floor and helped me recover my files while making terrible puns to calm me down. Hey, why was the computer cold? It left its windows open. God, it was bad. But I laughed anyway. When he finally saved everything, I almost. I hugged him. Then we both froze. Right. The rule. Before I left for the meeting, he wrote his number on a sticky note and handed it to me shyly. Here, in case you run into more computer problems. I felt my cheeks flush. I Stared at that sticky note for three days before texting him. We met up at a tiny coffee shop two blocks from the office. During lunchtime, we sat in the back corner, covering ourselves like criminals. Every time the door opened, we both look up, panicked. I watched him duck into the table. When someone from his department walked in to pick up coffee, I laughed. Wow. Crazy first date, huh? He grinned back at me from underneath the table. I love crazy. We were still pretty paranoid on the next few dates. But after three months, we started to get comfortable. Maybe a little too comfortable. That's when it happened. A close call. When we were out at an Italian restaurant to celebrate my promotion, Lance suddenly went ghost white. We need to leave now. But it was too late. Our boss, Joseph, entered the restaurant and locked eyes with us. He marched over, practically foaming at the mouth. Mind telling me what's going on? Lance and Beatrice from marketing. Lance stood up slowly. Dad, I can explain. Dad. I choked. Joseph glanced at our table full of candles and rose petals. Clearly not for a casual meeting. You're dating my son in my company, breaking my rules. The entire restaurant got quiet, watching months of secret dating all go down the drain. You're fired. You can forget about the Japanese presentation tomorrow. I won't have liars and rule breakers in my company. I got up and managed to Squeeze out a have a good evening before running out. Next morning, I came in early to pack my desk before everyone arrived, but Lance was already there waiting.

My daughter Kayla has this rare condition called Clipple File Syndrome. Basically her neck vertebra are fused together, which means her neck doesn't move like it should and her head sits weird on her shoulders. The doctors explained that if she ever got hurt and someone tried to move her neck the wrong way, she could become paralyzed or worse. When Kayla was 7, we met with this specialist who laid out all the scary scenarios, accidents, playground falls, sports injuries. Any first responder or doctor who didn't know about her condition might try to stabilise her neck in a way that could permanently damage her spinal cord. The specialist said we needed to make sure medical personnel would know immediately not to manipulate her neck. He recommended getting a medical alert tattoo right on her upper chest that would be visible even if she was unconscious. At first I thought he was crazy, tattoo my seven year old. But then he showed me photos of other kids who'd gotten them for similar conditions. They were small, simple, just the basic medical info in clear black letters. The doctor explained that medical jewellery could get lost or removed during trauma care, but a tattoo would always be there. He connected us with a tattoo artist who specialised in medical tattoos and worked with kids. The guy had done hundreds of these procedures and knew exactly how to make it As painless as possible. I talked to Kayla about it, explaining why it was important. She was scared at first, but when I told her it was like getting a special Mark that would keep her safe, she got more interested. The tattoo artist let her pick the font and showed her exactly what it would look like. The actual process took maybe 15 minutes. It was just three lines, Clipple feel syndrome, do not manipulate neck and see medical I d. Kayla gripped my hand but didn't cry. The artist gave her stickers afterwards and told her she was braver than most adults he worked on years. Everything was fine. Kayla's teachers knew about the tattoo. Her pediatrician approved of it. And we never had any issues. She actually liked having it because it made her feel special and protected. Then last month, Kayla's school called me to come in for a meeting. I figured it was about her grade.

I'd grown it out for three years specifically for the wedding. Rachel knew this. She'd been there through every trim, every deep conditioning treatment, every moment. I said no to a fun new cut because I wanted that long, romantic updo for my wedding day. She was supposed to protect me at the salon. That's why she came along instead. When I closed my eyes for the wash, she slipped the stylist $300 cash and whispered new instructions, cut it short, Pixie short. Say it was a miscommunication. The stylist took the money. When I opened my eyes, two feet of hair covered the floor and Rachel was fake gasping, hand over her mouth, playing shocked. The stylist kept apologizing, saying she thought I said I wanted a dramatic change, that I was tired of the length. I sobbed for two hours. Rachel held me, rubbed my back, said maybe it was meant to be that I'd look edgy and modern now. He offered to pay for extensions, but we both knew they'd never look right. With only six days to blend them properly that night, I couldn't stop thinking about Rachel's reaction. Too perfect, too rehearsed. The stylist had cut with such confidence, no hesitation, no checking in like they usually do with big changes. I called the salon the next morning, asked to speak to the manager, told her I suspected something happened. But needed to know for sure. She reviewed the security footage, called me back within an hour. Your friend handed our stylist money while you were at the wash station. We have it on camera. The audio is muffled, but you can see the cash exchange clearly. She offered to fire the stylist, offered free services for a year. I said no. Just emailed me the footage. I watched it 20 times. Rachel's smug little smile as she handed over the bills. The stylist nodding eagerly. Rachel checking to make sure I still had my eyes closed. I didn't confront her, not yet. Instead, I called James, told him everything. He was furious, but I asked him to wait. Let me handle this my way. Four days before the wedding, Rachel threw my bachelorette party, 15 women at a wine bar she booked. During her toast, she went on about our 12 year friendship, how she'd always been there for me, how she was so happy I found James.

She said her besties think she's out of my league and deserves better than a welder. When her backup plan failed, she wanted to get back together. I was engaged to Jessica for eight months when she dropped the bomb. We were sitting in our apartment on a Tuesday night eating leftover pizza when she got real quiet and said we needed to talk. My heart sank because nothing good ever starts with those words. She took off her engagement ring and put it on the coffee table between us. Her friends think I deserve better. She said, you're a welder, and I have a marketing degree. We're just at different places in life. I sat there staring at that ring, trying to process what was happening. Different places in life? I've been welding for six years, made decent money, had my own truck, paid off zero debt. But apparently that wasn't good enough for Jessica's college friends. Kept talking about how her bestie Amber had concerns, how her other friend Nicole said I wasn't ambitious enough, how they all agreed she could do better than a guy who works with his hands. I asked if this was really about her friends or if she felt this way, too. She looked away and said she just needed time to think. Time to figure out what she really wanted. I moved my stuff out that weekend. Stayed with my buddy Chris while I looked for A new place. Jessica kept our apartment since her name was on the lease. Whole thing felt surreal, like I was watching it happen to someone else. Two weeks later, Chris showed me Jessica's Instagram. She posted pictures at some fancy restaurant downtown with a guy in a suit. The caption said new beginnings. The guy was tagged some finance bro named Derek, who worked at the same company as Amber's boyfriend. Chris did some digging because that's what best friends do. Jessica had been talking to Derek for months before the breakup. They'd met at Amber's birthday party back in July. Derek drove a BMW, wore expensive watches, took her to wine tastings and art gallery openings.

I manage a marketing team of 12 people and Halloween costumes have always been optional at our office. This year, I was traveling to a conference in Denver, so I completely missed the party. When I landed at nine PM and checked my phone, I had 23 unread messages in our team group chat, everyone was posting photos, laughing about the costumes, agging each other. That's when I saw it. Courtney had dressed as what she called Basic Beatrix. She wore a blond wig cut and styled exactly like Beatrix's signature Bob, blue contacts to match beat Trix's bright blue eyes, the same rose gold nail polish Beatrix wears every single day without fail. She carried a Venti Starbucks pumpkin spice latte with Beatrix written on the side in Sharpie, wore those fuzzy fabric boots and black leggings, and spent the entire party acting ditzy and airheaded, playing up this exaggerated dumb blonde persona. The team voted her best costume by a landslide, 32 votes out of 40. Someone had even captioned a photo, the real Beatrix could never look this good. I stared at those photos for two hours in my hotel room. I didn't sleep that night. The next morning, Beatrix was waiting outside my office when I arrived at seven, 30. She's normally one of those people who's Always smiling, always bringing in homemade cookies for the team on Fridays. But that morning, her face was completely blank, almost gray. Can we talk? She asked quietly, not making eye contact. She sat across from my desk and didn't cry, but I could see her hands shaking in her lap. She kept twisting this silver ring on her right hand around and around. Everyone keeps calling us twins now, she said. Yesterday someone asked if I was going to dress up as Courtney next year for revenge, like it's this big joke we're both in on. I asked her if she talked to Courtney about it. Courtney's been my mentor for six months, Beatrix said, her voice barely above a whisper. She helped me with my first client pitch. She brought me coffee every morning when I was stressed about the Henderson project. She invited me to her apartment for her birthday dinner last month. I trusted her court.

She picked the wrong man. My fiance and I exchanged glances. I replied, perfect and got security to kick her out. The same night she texted, don't forget the mortgage payment and the Tesla car loan payments are tomorrow. I stared at that text until my hands stopped shaking. On read over my shoulder, what mortgage? What Tesla? That's when six years of lies came pouring out. When I was 22, my mother called crying, dad made bad investments. They'd lose the house. Could I help just temporarily? I co signed a 60 thousand dollar mortgage refinance. Six months later, I co signed a 55 thousand dollar Tesla loan. Because he deserves something nice. I promised to make every payment. I'd never see a Bill except the backup. Automatic transfers from my account became the primary. $700 monthly for the mortgage, $800 for the Tesla, plus insurance, taxes, emergencies, nearly $2,000 vanishing every month for six years. $150,000 of my money gone. I've been packing lunches and skipping trips thinking I was saving for our wedding. But I was barely breaking even, drowning while my mother pushed me under inch by inch. When I felt stressed about money, she'd say, you make good money, you're just bad with budgeting. She gaslit me into thinking I was the problem. John asked what I wanted to do. I logged into my bank and deleted every Automatic payment authorization. And I screenshot the confirmation and sent it to my mother with one message. You said you weren't paying for the circus. I'm not paying for your life anymore. I blocked her number, turned off my phone, let John hold me while I shook apart. The next morning brought 17 missed calls on John's phone. My mother's friends, my aunts, cousins, the family network activated with one message. I was selfish, ungrateful, destroying my family over one little disagreement. She'd recruited everyone to tell me. So then my mother's lawyer sent a letter threatening to sue me for emotional distress and financial damage caused.

Uncle Dave was telling his same fishing story from 1987. No one asked about my life, my job, nothing. Then my mom clinked her wine glass. Everyone, announcement time. The room went quiet. We've decided to do something special this year. We're all going On a family vacation together. We leave tomorrow morning. The room erupted in cheers. People were hugging, already planning what to pack. I felt this wave of relief. Okay, this made sense. They wanted me here so we could all go on this trip together. That's actually really nice.

I laughed because I thought she was joking.

I'm trying to show him the website on my phone when he suddenly lunges forward and yanks my wig clean off my head. The air conditioning hits my bare scalp. Thankfully, the study lounge is pretty empty, but still, I was embarrassed and my cheeks got red. My hands are shaking as I grab For my wig, but he's holding it above his head like a trophy. Give it back, I said. I managed to snatch it from his hands and quickly put it back on, adjusting it with trembling fingers. That wasn't nice, I say. My voice unsteady, I pack my stuff as fast as I can and start walking toward the exit. My heart still pounding, but I'm thinking, okay, that was horrible, but it's over now. I'm halfway cross the lounge trying to calm my breathing when something hard slams into the back of my head. The impact makes me stumble forward. I turn around and his shoe is on the floor behind me. This kid just threw his shoe at my head. You can't just throw things at people. I'm looking around desperately for a professor, security, anyone, but it's that dead time between classes. The lounge is still mostly empty except for some students way in the back corner with headphones on. Before I can move, he's charging at me, actually running full speed. I'm freaking terrified. He crashes into me and starts hitting my arms, scratching at my face. I'm trying to protect myself, holding my arms up to block him.

Everything changed after that. She started leaving homemade dinners with sticky notes, bibimbap pyeong and enjoy. We started having coffee together some mornings, barely talking, but the silence felt comfortable. Now three weeks later, she asked if I'd come to her company's pride Celebration event. Her co workers kept asking about her mysterious husband and she needed a real face. I went in my only button down without grease stains. She introduced me to everyone, her hand resting warm on my lower back, like done it forever. Five different co workers pulled me aside saying she never stops talking about me at work in the parking garage. Afterward, we sat in her prius in complete silence for 15 minutes. Then she told me her therapist had asked her directly if she was developing romantic feelings for me. I watched her knuckles turn white gripping the steering wheel. She said she told her therapist it's impossible because she's gay, exclusively attracted to women her entire 24 years. Last night she cooked real dinner for the first time. Galbi, six types of banchan, perfect white rice. The table set with actual plates instead of paper towels. Halfway through eating, she mentioned casually that her ex girlfriend Maya had reached out wanting to reconcile. Maya said our marriage is fake anyway, so we could just divorce early and they can be together for real. I set down my chopsticks carefully and waited, barely breathing. I didn't Want this to happen, she said she told Maya no without hesitation, said she couldn't explain it. But when she imagined me packing up and leaving, her chest physically hurt. She looked at me with terrified eyes and said she doesn't understand what's happening to her. 24 years of being exclusively gay, never once attracted to any man. But somehow I've become the person she thinks about first when something good happens at work. Our legal contract ends March 15. Five months from now, we're supposed to file for divorce and walk away clean. But we're sitting at this table and her hand reaches across to take mine, not for her parents, not for a staged photo, just for us. She whispers that she might never be physically attracted to me the way she was to women, that she doesn't know what label even fits her anymore. I tell her we don't need all the answers tonight. I say maybe we just don't file the divorce paperwork when March comes. Her eyes go wide, then soft, and she nods slowly. Two complete strangers who got married for money and survival, somehow accidentally becoming each other's home. We have five months left on our contract, but sitting here with her hand warm in mind, neither of us is counting down anymore.

I told her everything. She said I needed to tell Mia that Jordan was a creep and would probably try it with the next babysitter, too. I couldn't sleep that night. Kept thinking about those kids and how Mia seemed like a good person who deserved to know. Friday morning, I texted Mia asking if she had a minute to talk. She called me within five minutes. Sounded worried, asked if something happened with the kids. I told her everyone was fine, but I needed to tell her something about Thursday night. There was this long silence. Then she asked me to come over at 2, that Jordan would be at the office. I showed up at 2 exactly. Mia answered in scrubs, looked exhausted, had her hair in a messy bun. We sat at the kitchen table, same table where the kids ate their chicken nuggets every week. I told her exactly what happened. Didn't leave anything out. The hand on my knee, the comment about my maturity, the extra money, all of it. She didn't cry, didn't yell. Just sat there staring at her coffee mug. Then she asked if I was sure, if maybe I misunderstood. I showed her the text between me and my roommate from that night. Time stamped at 10:42, right after I left. She believed me. Said this wasn't the first time she'd had a feeling something was off. That one of his co workers wives mentioned Jordan being too friendly. At the Christmas party last year, she thanked me for telling her. Said she needed to figure some things out. I told her I couldn't babysit anymore, that I was sorry, but I didn't feel comfortable. She completely understood. Paid me for that night even though I said she didn't have to. Two weeks later, I saw a moving truck outside their house. My roommate heard from someone that Mia filed for separation, that Jordan was staying with his brother across town. The kids inflatable pool was gone from the front yard. I never talked to either of them again, but Mia sent me a Venmo payment with a note that said thank you for your honesty. It with $200. Jordan tried to friend me on social media a month later. I blocked him immediately. Screenshot it, sent it to Mia just in case she needed it. She replied with a thumbs up emoji. The house sold four months after that. New family moved in. Older couple with no kids.

So I've been watching Jordan and me as two kids every Thursday night for about 6 months. They lived three doors down, cute brick house with the inflatable pool always in the front yard. The kids were easy, 6 and 8 years old, ate Mac and cheese without complaining, went to bed by 9. Jordan traveled for work a lot and Mia worked late shifts at the urgent care clinic. So they needed the help. I was making decent money, like 40 bucks a night just to watch Netflix. After the kids passed out, last Thursday started normal. Mia texted me around 4 saying she'd be home by midnight, left pizza money on the counter. Usual deal. I showed up at 6:30. Kids were already in pajamas watching some cartoon about talking dogs. Jordan was packing his laptop bag, but he had to catch a flight to Dallas. Should be back Sunday. Cool, whatever. I helped the kids brush their teeth, read them two chapters of some book about dragons. Lights out. By 9:15, I was on the couch watching some crime show when I heard the front door open around 10:30. Figured Mia got off early, which was great because I had an exam to study for. But it was Jordan walking in, still in his work clothes, tie loosened. He looked surprised to see me, said his flight got Canceled something about weather delays. He asked if the kids went down okay, poured himself some whiskey from the cabinet, real casual. Then he sat down next to me on the couch, not like across the room or in the armchair right next to me, close enough I could smell the whiskey, started talking about how stressful work was, how Mia was always tired lately, how they barely talked anymore. I just nodded, trying to focus on my phone, texting my roommate about picking me up early. He put his hand on my knee, said I was really mature for 20, that he could tell I understood things most people my age didn't. I stood up immediately, grabbed my backpack. He asked where I was going, said Mia wouldn't be home for another hour, that we could just talk, fuck like I was stupid. I told him I had to leave, that my roommate was outside. He got defensive, said I was misreading the situation, that he was just being friendly. Then he tried to hand me 60 bucks instead of the usual 40, said I deserved extra for dealing with his stress tonight. I left the money on the table and walked out. My roommate picked me up, asked why I looked.

And I'm scared because I'm falling for her too. We got married seven months ago for 87 dollars at King County Courthouse. I was 27, drowning in 190 thousand dollar medical debt from my dad's stage 4 cancer treatment. She was 24, her traditional Korean parents threatening conversion therapy unless she married a man. By her 25th birthday. They'd already cut off her two million dollar trust fund and enrolled her in a Montana camp starting June 1st. We met through my sister's girlfriend who knew someone desperate. She had an undercut and kept her rainbow wrist tattoo covered the entire meeting. The contract was three pages. I get 70 thousand dollar cash after joint taxes. She gets her inheritance and avoids conversion therapy. Two years minimum. Married for credibility. We shook hands over cold fries and scheduled the courthouse. Her parents flew 60 relatives from Seoul and paid fifteen thousand dollars for the wedding. My mom sobbed through the ceremony thinking I'd finally found someone after my ex left. We did the first dance where she had to whisper where to put my hands every time. Guests to glasses demanding kisses. Her entire body went rigid. We managed four quick pecks. Mechanical and awkward like signing paperwork. The Capital Hill apartment became two strangers under one roof. She worked remote for Amazon. Door closed 9 to 6 with APOP leading through. I pulled 60 hour weeks as a line Cook at canvas. Coming home past midnight smelling like duck fat. We had a bathroom schedule taped to the mirror for six months. We spoke maybe 200 words total, mostly excuse me in the kitchen. Then her parents ambushed us on a Saturday in October. She texted during lunch, prep parents here in 20 min. Help! I lied to my sous chef about a family emergency. Raced home in my chef whites. Everything had transformed. When I arrived, my PlayStation was shoved deep in her bedroom closet. Her pride flags were hidden behind winter coats. Wedding photos suddenly covered every wall, half still showing the stock cup in the frames. Her dad asked about my salary and grandchildren. Immediately, she invented our entire relationship. Morning coffee routine, my preferences, weekend hikes we'd never taken. That night, she described our intimate bedroom life to her mother in detail, while I stood there nodding, slowly dying inside. They stayed three brutal days. After they finally left, I found her at 2:00am on the bathroom floor, still wearing the modest floral dress she

I immediately clocked that hoe in the face, and she fell back into the flowers. Why would you say that? I screamed, not caring that everyone in the funeral home turned to stare. Annie held her face, looking more sad than hurt. It seems you don't know about your father's double life. What are you talking about? I looked around the room and noticed something strange. Everyone was avoiding my eyes. My aunt suddenly found the calculator app fascinating. My cousins whispered behind their hands. Even the funeral director looked uncomfortable, like he knew something I didn't. The entire room felt heavy with a secret they all shared except me. I grabbed Annie's arm and pulled her into the hallway. Tell me what my father did right now. She shook her head and pressed her lips together. I don't want to speak it in fear that I'll be excluded from heaven like that lustful monster. Just speaking the words might condemn me, too. This was insane. Annie and I had been friends since kindergarten. She'd slept over my house hundreds of times. My dad had driven us to school and made us pancakes and taught us both to ride bikes. What could he have possibly done that was so terrible? She thought saying it would damn her soul. I stormed back into the viewing room and found my mom dabbing her Eyes by the guestbook. Mom, what is everyone talking about? What did dad do? Her face crumpled and fresh tears started flowing. It's absolutely disgusting. I can't even think about it without feeling sick. She hurried toward the bathroom, leaving me standing there even more confused. My Uncle Gary was outside smoking with some other relatives. He'd been my dad's brother and best friend. Surely he'd tell me the truth. But when I asked him, he just shook his head and stared at the ground. I don't know if I can even call him my brother anymore. What he did goes against everything our family believes in. He flicked his cigarette away and walked back inside without another word. I was getting desperate now. My father was lying in a casket inside, and everyone was acting like he'd been some kind of monster. What secret could be so horrible that his own brother disowned? I found my grandma sitting on a bench outside, smoking her Virginia Slims. If anyone would give me a straight answer, it was her. Grandma didn't believe in sugar coating anything and had opinions about everything. Grandma, please. Everyone's acting like dad did something unforgivable, but no one will tell me what. I sat down next to her, trying not to cry. She took a long drag and rolled her eyes. Oh, please. You want to know what your father did? She pulled out her phone and scrolled through Facebook with her perfectly manicured nails. After Your whore of a mother cheated on your father and left him. He got super drunk one night, posted a video of himself at a party with his friends. I break.

Why would you say that about mom, I asked. Shocked. No reason, he said quickly, and walked away to look at Aunt Darla's body in the casket. I stood there confused, watching him stare down at my aunt's peaceful face. My sister Zoe came up beside me and grabbed my arm. Did dad tell you that thing about mom? She asked. I swear he has absolutely no shame. Why would he say that, I asked, still trying to process what just happened. Don't you know about dad and Aunt Darla? Did they have an affair? Zoe laughed, but it wasn't a happy sound. I wish it's much more complicated than that. She pulled me outside the church into the parking lot. The air was cold and I could see my breath. Zoe looked around to make sure nobody followed us. You, I have to swear you won't repeat this to anyone, she said. I swear dad knew Aunt Darla before he even met mom. They were dating for three years. They were so in love it made everyone sick. Dad bought a ring and everything. What happened, mom happened. She was Darla's younger sister and she was obsessed with dad. She wanted him so bad she used to follow them on dates. This was getting weird. I'd never heard any of this before. My parents always acted like they'd been Together forever. One night, dad was going to propose at this fancy restaurant. Darla left early to get ready. She was walking across the parking lot when someone hit her with their car. Oh, my god. It was mom. She ran over her own sister. Darla was paralyzed from the waist down. She couldn't have kids anymore. I felt sick. My mom had crippled her own sister out of jealousy. But here's where it gets really messed up, Zoe continued. Darla always wanted kids. She'd frozen her eggs before the accident just in case. So she asked mom to be her surrogate to carry dad and Darla's baby. Mom agreed to that. She said yes. She went through the whole process, nine months of pregnancy. Everyone thought she was being this amazing sister. Zoe stopped talking and looked back at the search. Through the window, we could see dad still standing by the casket. What happened? I asked, even though I was scared to know. Mom lied. She never used Darla's eggs. She used her own. When the baby was born, it was mom and Dad's kid it, not Darla's. That was me, wasn't it? I already knew the answer. Yeah. You were supposed to be Darla's son. Dad didn't find out until after you were born. Mom had the doctors in on it. She paid them to fake the records. Sat down on the curb feeling like I might throw up. My whole life was built on my mom. Stealing me from my aunt. When dad found out, he tried to leave, Zoe said, sitting next to me. But mom had planned for that, too. What did she do? She told dad if he didn't marry her, she'd accuse him of assault. She had fake evidence ready, photos she doctored. Witness.

Every person who has come here illegally must be returned to their country of origin and and I completely agree with you um, I'm here to say something I really like the speech that JD Vance did in Munich after the terrorist attack do we like JD Vance? Everybody isn't JD great well, I'm not American, but I like him too if I were American, I would have voted for him however, um, in in Europe we are having a a big problem with illegal immigration people are coming they don't they don't respect our laws that raping women stabbing is dangerous to go around so it I don't understand when people come here to talk to you liberals and Democrats saying that they want to welcome them because you don't know who's entering in your country amen and I'll tell you we need more legal immigrants like you in this country I'll tell you what and it makes me upset that for me for me it's difficult I'm Respecting the law, I'm here.

That attitude is why we're $35 trillion in debt. Secondly, which is very important, if you analyze Doja's savings, you know how much they're on pace to save this year? A trillion dollars. One trillion dollars. Which would then get us on path for a balance budget. They're on pace because you say, oh, it's only a billionaire. They've been in for six weeks. They've already saved $100 billion. Yeah, but by December, they'll be at a trillion. Our deficit is 1.6 trillion. We're gonna lower our deficit in such an increasingly important way, and you're gonna learn that you actually don't need these government agencies to run a country, that these people are unnecessary. It's bloated. These bureaucrats don't do anything all day long, and we need to right size it because we're a nation in debt. We know we're $35 trillion in debt. Yes. In debt. Yes. And the only way we're gonna get out of it is if we're honest. Be like, how about no more empty buildings? No more $115 for equity assessment? The way we get out of it is by biodiversity in Nepal. $19 million. Again, those can be important. You guys are like, those could be helpful. Okay, so how could biodiversity in Nepal for 19 million bucks? We spent $20 million for a new Sesame Street in Iraq. It's true. You guys can look it up. $20 million for new Sesame Street in Iraq. And because no one has ever had the courage, To look through the books and look and examine the expenditures. That's not what's happening. No, it has happened. No, Biden, Obama, they never look through any of the federal expenditures, and we got to $35 trillion in debt. This is the first time in my lifetime we have an administration going after the waste, going after the size of government to balance the budget so that you guys don't live as indentured servants and Russian serfs for the rest of your life. Tell him, Charlie. Tell him. Well, I just want to say, like. What? Never mind. Go ahead. You don't need to interrupt people. Thank you. The point is when you, when you want to deal with this problem, you can either increase taxes or cut spending massively. Like, the point is that, like, these programs aren't, aren't efficient and helpful for getting to that goal. Yes, they, I, I just proved to you that they're on pace. Trillion dollars a cup. Like, but. But even if it's only a billion or two billion, that's admirable and noble. That's my. Just so you understand, just so we're clear, it's your fault. You have to do. You have to both justify that these programs are bad and then. No, you can just. You can flash. This is a program. It cost this much money. We should admit it. That's not an argument. $1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia. Again, you can say that. You can say that. Do Do. Do you know anything about Liberia? I mean, like. I mean, no. I mean, I happen to know a lot about it. Again, that's a separate issue. But it's not about what I know. It's about the people in the government making these decisions. Yes, and they. They have proven themselves to be robber barons over the last 20 years. That they. That they have been spending your money with reckless abandon and total indiscretion. And it's time that this is what's important. It's we the people, not we the government workers, and we've taken back the government. The government. The government workers are also American people. Yes, but who works for who? Do we work for them or do they work for us? They work for us. They work for us. Which one? Yes, they work for. They work for us. Obviously they work for us. Yes. So we voted in November, by popular vote and electoral vote landslide, that this crap is over. And that's what we're doing. We. We overwhelmingly spoke. And so we're gonna go piece by piece, department by department. And this is why it's important. You guys deserve a future where you don't have $35 trillion in debt when you don't have a trillion dollars in debt. You're not solving that problem by doing this again. I have. Again, a trillion dollars. You have to address this. They're on pace to cut a trillion by December. That's big. Big. That's. That's. That's 75% of Our deficit. Okay, but my point. My point is that, like, you have to meaningfully increase taxes or cut. No, you don't like cuts. Yes, you do. Well, I know that's what he's doing. They are meaningfully cutting spending. Do you have to get the tax. Is it either raise taxes? No, you don't. Or cut. Or massively cut spending. Got it. Let me just. Let me just. Let me just ask one. One final question. Yes? If Trump and Elon get this done and balance the budget and cut all this, will you give them credit? It depends on how successful. But. Wait, I am not finished speaking. Oh, my god. It depends on how successful the country is afterwards. It depends if you make a lot of cuts and the country becomes worse that you didn't do your job. Okay, we'll see what happens. Thank you.

You can get a job at Alphabet. Google? Yes. Taking a C plus plus class, correct? Yes, yes. They're hiring coders after a 60 day coding class while having to go to sea Boulder and learn about North African lesbian poetry. Whatever they teach it, so. But to. To. To answer your question, a country that ceases to secure its own sovereignty and does not think I care more about my own people and the foreigners ceases to be a country. You're a colony and you're something else. And we are seeing our generosity be taken advantage of. I am all for American charities going down to pan Panama and helping out. I'm all for people giving to charity, when you start to see the government give preference and priority to not even on taxpayers, that's why you get the rise of Trump. So we should reallocate US spending towards things that are actually effective for evil in and outside of our borders. Well, so then we don't have people coming into our borders and then we can help our people. Well, No, the way. Again, if they come to the border and the border is closed and you say, Asta LA Vista, go back to Nicaragua. We. We spend in Central America. They don't have to come to the US. No, and then we have a better US. That's the same amount of spending. No, no, it's the first of all, if you. To solve the problems of the Third World would cost trillions of dollars and that would all be laundered and not even work. And again, it's not the position of the American government to go throw money around in the Southern Triangle. Instead, it's our country's closed. We're not open for looting anymore. Don't make Nicaragua great again or go do what El Salvador has done. El Salvador is now a safe and stable country and they're seeing their GDP go up and it's not because of us. Yeah, it is. We put $4 billion into Central America. Hold on, hold on. And you know, Buchanan barely took the money. You know why it's safe? Bucarelli has turned El Salvador safe cause he locked up all the criminals. He locked up 40,000 criminals and put them in prisons. And El Salvador is now safer than America. El Salvador was the murder capital of the world. And now El Salvador is much safer than America. I think it's wrong if you guys are afraid to walk the streets of Denver at night. I wouldn't walk the streets of Denver at night. Would you guys? No, that's A breakdown of the fundamental role of government. Would you guys walk the streets of LA at night?

So, since January 20, um, 2025, Trump has had one of the worst presidential terms concerning the economy. And there are statistics to back this up. SMP has dropped 8%, Dow Jones dropped 7%, the Russells dropped 12%. The way I understand it, tariffs are attacks that are passed on to consumers. They impede upon the world free trade and increase the cost of imported goods. This not only has tanked our economy, but is actually putting small businesses across America out of work. Middle class Americans that voted for Trump believing prices would drop are now having to close down their small business because they used to rely on outsourcing. Now, I understand that Trump's goal with this tariff policy is to bring back jobs to America. However, this is an unrealistic reality. Even though some corporations are moving production to the US to avoid tariff, in reality, most would rather pass the cost onto consumers than financially pay billions of dollars in building new plants in America and paying higher wages. With all of this, I wanted to ask you if you could please defend Trump's tariff plan. Sure. Uh, great. Um, first of all, the. The markets recovering, but you're right, it has gone down. The market is not a necessarily good indicator of the economy. We have an economy, and then we have a market. Half Americans don't know any stocks, just for the record. Okay? And That's a very important thing, right? There's a lot of Americans have money in stocks, and of course they do. Money every day. Well, not actually. Okay, you're in high school. So I'm just gonna be like, super gentle. Like, the markets been up the last couple days, right? Markets go up, markets go down. Okay? The more important question, though, is what type of economy is going to survive the next 40 or 50 years when we do not make our own vitamin C, we don't make our own antibiotics, we don't make our own drone parts, and it's all made in China. We should try to redomesticate it. It's. It's. It's tempting to blame this all on tariffs, but there's actually no tariffs that are in place right now. You know that, right? There's. There's still a 10% baseline tariff. And even though there's a 90 day pause, they're gonna come back. Well, that's the reality. You. You. You know that better than I do, right? Yeah, well, I. I know that that's a. Oh, yeah, sure. Okay. There's a 90 day pause. Okay, so again, I'm trying to be super like, you're in high school. It's fine. You know, Trump's talking to South Korea and Japan and Vietnam. Okay? We're gonna get massive deals with India, and we're going to fix the trade imbalances. And here's the core of it. Can we at least agree that Trump ran on the idea of terrorism? He did. And people voted For it? Yes. Should elected leaders do what people vote for them to do? Yes, but. Okay, but I, I agree that he's doing what he said he would do. What I'm asking you is how can you defend what he's doing? Cause. Because what would you say to the middle class American that has a small business that now has to shut down their business because they used to outsource to China and now they can't pay due to the high tariffs? That's my question. They were outsourcing to China? Well, most, even though some small businesses don't outsource, they get a lot of their production from big companies that do make their products foreign. And so now those prices are being jacked up and small businesses are running out of, out of customers because they're having to pass the cost. I, I see no evidence of that happening. And I, I believe first of all, what, what is. What is the definition of a tariff? Well, the tariff is a duty on an imported product. How do you avoid a tariff? Yeah, you move to the US. Yeah, exactly.

Uh, Trump has proposed somewhere around 60% tariffs of China and 20% tariffs on the rest of the world. Um, this is extremely concerned. I mean, this is a return to smooth holly back in. Yeah. So, um, tell me why. So tell me what tariffs currently? Because we have over 300 of them on the books. That you think are currently harming the American economy. So the. I. I don't know. I can't tell you exactly. Every tear from the book. Tell me one. Okay, the. The tear that Trump imposed on washing machines back in 2016, 2017, I believe it was. If you look at the statistics for household appliances in general, they have increased the price and Biden has actually kept that tariff in. In play. And obviously this is something that's kind of, um. It doesn't strike at the core of our. Of what? Of consumers. But it's still the. If the tariffs increase across all goods, it will. They will increase prices. Yes. I guess. Two questions. With tariffs. How do you avoid a tariff? You don't put. I mean, you don't. You don't put one on the other country. No. Let's pretend you're Toyota. How do you avoid a terrorist coming into America? You. You transfer the money, the cost to consumer. No. Why not? No, no. How do you. How do you avoid a terrorist if you're Toyota? I'm not sure. I'm not sure what you're asking. You build the car in America. Okay, yeah. Okay, so it's not a trick. It's not a trick question, right? So let me tell you what's happened. For example, Lincoln Baines Johnson, not my favorite president, put a 25% tariff on pickup trucks. Most people don't know this exists. Toyota actually, uh, per capita, has some of the most popular pickup trucks in the country. Who here knows a Toyota pickup truck? I guarantee some of you guys do. They make all of them in America to avoid that. That tariff. So when you're the incumbent economic power, tariffs are actually really, really helpful. Now, if you're a small fledgling country such as Portugal, tariffs can be really, really disastrous cause you do not have the global reserve currency status. There's been a lot of fraudulent and flimsy economic studies done by major corporations that have made you seem as if free trade is the greatest thing ever. But for example, solar panel tariffs, pickup truck tariffs, um, even household appliances and electric tariffs. What happens over time is these companies want to do business with us, so they end up bending the knee and building their plant in America. Which is great for industry, great job. It's not a zero sum game. You. You realize that when you're building something here that could be better built somewhere else, that money could be spent. Hold on. Now this is interesting. So Of course it could be cheaper in China. Yes, but wouldn't you rather have Americans be employed to make it? Well, that's my choice as a consumer. It's not a choice of the government to impose a tax to tell me where to buy it. Well, actually, they can chip in. This is where we have a moral difference. our government actually has a moral obligation to employ its citizens before the cheapest possible. Good. Let me, uh. I'm pretty people who might have followed me now, I'm pretty libertarian in my instincts. Let me just ask you a question about. About this is if another country is applying a tariff to the United States on our own goods, is it fair game to say that we got to play by the same rules in both directions? Well, I. I'm a fan, honestly, of turning of the cheek in that sense. See, so that's. That's what you're gonna do. Cause I'm pretty libertarian on a lot of, you know, but I do actually land in a very similar place. Well, I land in a place called Donald Trump does when you look at his actions as US president. All right, what did US president was. Cause I'm going to go somewhere with this. First of all, you take another country that puts a tariff on us. What we have been doing is turning the other cheek for too long. And I am a big fan of following our Judeo Christian values in the country and the way we live our lives, but not in our economic policy. To turn the other cheek. Will be slapped by other countries with tariffs on the other side, he's gonna be strong enough to protect who you are. So. So number one is, when Donald Trump, you actually end up looking at what he end up doing. Terrorist he slapped down. countries have been applying those terrorists to us asymmetrically. That's not free trade. That's not playing by the same set of rules. Now, you'll see some other cases where terrorists were applied, but they say, oh, no, is that other country actually applying a terrorist? There's a lot of ways to apply a tariff. One of the ways you apply tariff is you get state sponsorship. So in those other countries, even in Japan, even other countries around the. Around the TPP partnership, what they do is those governments support their own companies. When our own government does not support those industries here, that effectively is a terrorist, because it makes our own companies less competitive. So in some ways, this whole debate about tariffs and Donald Trump, two things are true about it. One is, Biden's kept everyone of the terrorists that Donald Trump has. It's not a choice between the two candidates. Number two is pragmatically. When you look at the way Donald Trump did this, he's a pragmatist. What he ended up doing was just applying A tariff to countries that already applied one to us, directly or indirectly. And even as somebody who leans pretty libertarian, and I'll tell you, it is totally fair game for demanding that other countries play by the same set of rules that we do, rather than turning the other cheek economically, which is not the thing I think we should do in America. Okay, thank you, man. Thanks. I'll just. One look. What? You do not have a free market, which, embedded in the idea of a free market, is that you have an independent rule system. If one country is terrorizing you, and you are not, in fact, and you're actually disadvantaging your country for no particular reason. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you.

And I think what we would be better doing for all Americans is go back to the first Constitution rather than the second one that we rebelled. So my question, like, really, like, to Charlie. So, like, you would like, if you had the opportunity, you would get rid of the Civil Rights Act? No, I think you should have a one page Bill that says that racial discrimination based on race is illegal and will not be tolerated in the United States of America. I would. I would simplify it. I would not have all. So. So what happened is that the Civil Rights Act has nine different titles in it, and you have this, this leviathan that was created. And something that most black Americans don't support is men and female sports. Would you agree? What should we say that again? Men playing in female sports? Oh, hell no. Yeah, I know this. No, no, for sure. Right. Believe it or not, the Civil Rights Act is now being used to keep men playing in women's sports. So it's. So the Civil Rights Act was used to help black America originally. Totally. Get that. But now the way it was written is that any claim of identification. So someone says, I'm a woman, therefore I can compete in your volleyball team, they come in with a civil rights claim. And so what we're saying is, no, no, no, It should be specified to racial, not gender, all that other stuff. And there were all these other provisions as well. Alright, and my, like, last question. Yeah? Do you think, like, if Trump come back into office, you think like, Young Thug is getting free? Or like, any, like, these people in jail? You all know Young Thug. What is it? Who's getting free? Young Thug. Is Young Thug getting free of Trump come back into office? And like, why? So, like, what would you vote for him if he promised to pardon? Oh, yeah. Hell yeah. If, if, if Young Thug was coming back, like, we need new music and stuff, so I feel like, yeah, we'll pass that along. Alright, appreciate that. Appreciate that. What's your name again? Jerry.

We actually want to balance budget so the US dollar will be around for future generations. I reject this whole thing that oh, you guys are only pro life at birth? No, every policy that we have is rooted in a pro life position. Okay, alright, so let's move a little bit on from that. Not saying I've lost yet. Cause a woman did kill her own child. Literally like a couple of days ago on day of birth. 60 years in prison. As she should have. But like that is a abortion problem. She was raped. But. but let's move. But what if she would have killed the baby while it was in the womb? It would have been okay. So why was it wrong to kill the baby outside the womb? Cause the baby could cry. Oh, the baby can't cry in a womb. Okay, okay. No, no, no. Talk about. No, no, no. You brought it up. Why is it. Why is it bad to slit the throat of a baby once it's born, but okay to slit the throat of the baby if it's in the womb? Less cells. Just straight up less cells. I would say different as a one day difference as a one day to count the cells. Less cells. Right. Wait, so the amount of cells you have dictate your moral worth? I have more. I do not want to get into this moral. No, you already did. Okay, hold on, I will, I. Would you? Would you? No. Would you say it? No. What's stopping you? I mean, what's stopping you? what line in the Bible is gonna stop you going up to a group of guys, go, hey fellas, mind if I say a word? Mind if I say it? Will you sit My peace. No, you say the word. Cause I have a different set of morals. I say, oh, by what? That's just wrong. By what moral is that wrong? By morals of around. Find out. I'm gonna get my jumped. I will get this out of me. This. Oh, presumptuous. I don't know about you, but any kind of. Any kind of argument that there's an objective morality? Of course there is. Was it was. Was Hitler objectively evil? Yeah. Okay, so we agree. Amount of cells. Amount of cells gone. Biomass. That's kind of. So wait, so does someone who is older have more moral rights than a four year old cause they have more cells? Depends on the person. What

Don't put me on hold again. Just find them. I will, Beth. Don't worry. I'll find them. I hope so. Oh, that was complicated. I'm so happy. What? Happy? Try to hold it. I'll pull over soon. They're running away to Mexico? Yes, on a dirt bike? What kind of mileage those things get? Better than you think. Wait, who are you calling? A guy who can help. Hello? Ruben, it's Georgie. I need your help. What time is it? I don't know, but my sister ran away to Mexico with some guy. So why are you calling me? Cause you're Mexican. Dude, I'm Puerto Rican. Since when? Since I was born Puerto Rico and a part of Mexico. Oh my god. No, but you speak Spanish like Mexican people, right? Okay, give me. Sorry to bother you, Ruben. See? Okay, so what's the plan? Oh, they're probably headed for the border crossing at Los Indios.

Seeing Patrick's success, SpongeBob couldn't wait to try it himself. He told Patrick to let him out in 15 seconds. As Patrick started the machine, SpongeBob's skin quickly turned bronze as well. He begged Patrick to stop the device, but Patrick immediately forgot. What somebody say something? Distracted by the attention of a group of girls who were mesmerized by his glowing tan, Patrick completely forgot about SpongeBob. Two whole hours later, Patrick finally came back. When he shut down the machine, thick smoke poured out of the house. SpongeBob stumbled out, pale as a ghost, scaring Patrick half to death. Looking at himself in the mirror, SpongeBob broke down. Wanting SpongeBob to still attend the party, Patrick decided to give him a makeover. He covered SpongeBob's body with MUD, decorated his teeth with seaweed, and even pulled out his own armpit hair to use as SpongeBob's wig. But as soon as they walked down the street, SpongeBob was mistaken for a monster by the townsfolk and got beaten up badly. So Patrick took SpongeBob to an ice cream shop. He smashed ice cream all over SpongeBob's body and smeared it evenly, giving SpongeBob the perfect skin tone. At the party, SpongeBob and Patrick's tans passed the test flawlessly. The organizer brought out sun lamps ready to kick off the wild Celebration. But as the light shined on SpongeBob, the caramel on his body began to Harden. Eventually he couldn't move at all. In front of everyone's eyes, the hardened caramel cracked open and SpongeBob's dazzling, radiant skin lit up the entire room. The crowd was ready to kick him out, but the party organ.

I accidentally dropped a Rolex worth millions into the water. As I dove down to search for it, I unexpectedly stumbled upon a mysterious stone. Being an experienced treasure hunter, I immediately recognized it as a ballast stone commonly used on ancient ships. Typically, such stones are found near sunken ships that are filled with treasure. So without wasting any time, I surfaced and told my companions about the find. As soon as they heard, they grabbed their weapons and dove in to help search. Before long, I made another discovery. It wasn't until I pried it free that I realized it was a golden dagger from centuries ago. Finding such a priceless treasure made me feel exhilarated. Now all we had to do was locate the treasure at the bottom of the sea and we'd be set for life. To improve our search efficiency, we headed to the market and bought a bunch of detection gear. Then we returned to the same area of the sea. First, we marked out the approximate zone with ropes, then began carefully searching with a metal detector. Didn't take long before the metal detector beeped. I immediately instructed my companion to use a hair dryer to blow away the surface sand. Moments later, a thick iron chain emerged from the sand. Realizing we were onto something big, we felt a rush of ex.

After catching some fish, she didn't eat them. Instead, she crushed the small ones, breaking them into pieces, and threw them back into the sea. The smell of blood quickly spread through the water. Anna stood on the shore, holding a sharp stick, staring intently at the surface of the water. Soon, a large, confused fish swam near her. Anna seized the chance and with luck managed to spear the fish. This brought her a sense of joy. When she made it back to the shore, she endured the torment of hunger, but didn't eat the fish right away. Instead, she hung it high in a tree, waiting silently. As night fell, she crawled into a sand pit to observe quietly, seemingly waiting for some more dangerous creature to appear. But perhaps due to extreme exhaustion, Anna soon fell into a deep sleep. When she woke up again, she discovered that the fish hanging in the tree was gone. Her eyes widened in horror as she frantically looked around, but found nothing out of the ordinary. Desperate to figure out what was happening on the island, Anna began searching everywhere. Before long, she found a matchbox in the forest. However, as she turned to head back, she heard a sound behind her.

Then during his work shift, he used a grinding tool to sharpen a sewing needle, which he then used to stitch over the damaged areas, creating a new design that covered up the prison markings. He even modified his hat, spray painting a fake Nike logo on it. By wearing these altered clothes, he knew he'd be harder to spot if he managed to escape. Next, while inspecting the delivery truck's mechanical issues for the driver, he quietly measured the distance between two steel beams under the truck's chassis. He then crafted a wooden board just big enough for him to lie on when the driver returned to unload goods. Next time, that would be his perfect chance to break out after the cargo was unloaded. Using the loud roar of the truck's engine as cover, Jimmy swiftly grabbed the board, rolled under the vehicle and secured it between the two steel beams. Only by hiding on top of this board could he pass the upcoming security checkpoint. The engine noise was so loud that the driver didn't notice anything unusual during the entire process. At the prison gate, the guards used an inspection mirror to check the underside of the truck. Thanks to the board's concealment, Jimmy passed undetected. But just 500 meters outside the prison, the truck came to an abrupt stop. Fortunately, it wasn't because Jimmy had been discovered.

And you not only did not go to Harvard Law School, you haven't even gone to any law school. What if I told you that I consume knowledge like no one you've ever met and I've actually passed the bar? I'd say you're full of crap. That's a Barbie legal handbook right there. Right. Open it up. Read me something. Anything. Civil liability associated with agency is based on several factors, including the deviation of the agent from his path, the reasonable inferences of agency on behalf of the plaintiff, and the nature of the damages themselves. How did you know that? I Learned it when I studied for the bar. Okay, hotshot, fire up this laptop. I'm gonna show you what a Harvard attorney can do. Pick a topic. Stock option backdating. Although backdating options is legal, violations arise related to disclosures under IRC Section 4 0 9 a. You forgot about Sarbanes Oxley. The statue of limitations render Sarbanes Oxley moot post 2 thousand seven. Well, not if you can find actions to cover up the violation as established in the 6th Circuit, May 2008. It's impressive, but you're sitting at a computer playing hearts. Sorry. If you wanna beat me, you're gonna have to do it at something else. How can you know all that? I told you, I like to read. And once I read something, I understand it. And once I understand it, I never forget it. Why take the bar? This dickhead bet me I couldn't pass it without going to law school. Let me tell you something. This isn't elementary school. This is hard work. Long hours, high pressure. I need a grown goddamn man. You give me this, and I will work as hard as it takes to school those Harvard douches and become the best lawyer you have ever seen. I'm inclined to give you a shot. But what if I decide to go another way? I say that's fair. And sometimes I like to hang out with people who aren't that bright. You know, just to see how the other half lives. Move over. I'm emailing the firm. I just found our next associate. Mike Ross. Hi. I'm Rachel Zane. I'll be giving you your orientation. Wow. You're pretty good. You've hit on me. We can get it out of the way that I'm not interested. No, I'm sorry. I wasn't hitting on you. Trust me. I've given dozens of these, and without fail, whatever new hot shot it is thinks that because I'm just a paralegal, but I will somehow be blown away by his dazzling degree.

Wait, so you're worried that if I stay, then they might find out that you lied about me, and you'll lose your license? But if you fire me, then I could tell them that you lied about me, and you definitely lose your license. Are you telling me that if I throw you under the bus, you're gonna drag me with you? But you put your interests above mine, and I'm just putting mine back up next to yours. You're rehired. Okay. So should I. All right, here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna give me back my promotion, and that's the last we're gonna talk about this. And why is that? Because if you don't, I'm gonna go across town and join Rick Peterson. I'm gonna approach every client I've ever closed, and I'm gonna take them with me. You do that, and you'll force me to put you in front of the ethics board. I don't think you will. And why not? Because you are obligated to notify them. The second I lied to Gerald. But you didn't. You put me in front of the board right now, I'll put you right up there with me. I'll, um. I'll give you your promotion. But you have to do something for me. Anything. Ah. Pro Bono. Anything but that. Harvey, pro Bono cases are how we, as a firm, show that we care about more than just ourselves. I'm not saying we shouldn't do them. I'm saying I shouldn't do them.

Got anything for us? Multiple bullet trajectories. Three shooters on this hit. Witnesses either too far or too scared to give us any description. Shooting a cop in broad daylight on the street, the police immediately suspected local gang groups and because of that, no witness dared to provide evidence to the police. The surrounding surveillance cameras didn't catch the suspect and the suspect used a revolver which doesn't leave shell casings. So it was clear the killer had to be premeditated. He not only knew the patrol cops route, but also knew the neighborhood well enough to avoid the cameras. At Honda's informant quickly shot down the police's guest. You're telling me this ain't even a set of mags coming out of Jordan Downs or a rival crew in from Hassy in the village? I will look. Somebody took down a cop, Trey. Hey, come on, man. In a trap house in watch you don't know about. So how come this one got you stuck? Don't tell me you're losing a step, man, man. Keep slander out your mouth. Turns out right after the attack, several gangs had already contacted him to pass along a message to Hondo. They didn't do this. No one wanted the police around. But the morning's attack had soured their relations with the cops. Again, Hondo told them to stay. Calm they'd track down the killer as soon as possible. Soon the Joint Task Force zeroed in on a suspect, Misael Ltuzo Martinez, L2D gang leader and multiple offender. You think this guy's graduated from running drugs to being a cop killer? It turned out the L2D gang had long held a grudge against the targeted patrol cop. Not long ago, one of Martinez's lieutenants had been arrested by this cop. So he had every reason to carry out this attack. Plus, DEA surveillance records showed Martinez had even threatened to get revenge on the police during internal gang calls. So it was necessary to bring him in for questioning. But there was a major problem. The L2D gangs territory was converted from World War 2 barracks. It was like a perfect foxhole. Dubbed a no go zone for cops his homies have shot in the cross before to get away from police. Yeah, put bounties on injured cops. Zero some game, but it gets you a badge on the hip. We need a plan. That doesn't give him time to prepare or let lookouts warn Martinez to run.

My classmates thought I was acting weird, so they asked me to count again. But even after counting three times, it was always 30 people. I finally realized that seat was empty. What I was seeing was actually a ghost. I could only pretend not to see it. After school, I started searching for why I could see ghosts, but the internet didn't have any clear answers. Then I accidentally discovered there was also a ghost on the bus. I got so scared, I started crying. Didn't expect that after getting off, I'd run into the ghost of a little boy. I screamed and ran back home, only to find the little boy had followed me and was now watching TV. But I could only pretend I couldn't see him because once you reveal you can see ghosts, you get tangled up in all kinds of trouble. However, this one day, I noticed a ghost following my best friend. I started searching online for ways to get rid of ghosts. After learning that salt has purifying effects, I borrowed some from a classmate and sprinkled it on my friend. But it didn't work at all. A few days later, at an event, another girl could also see ghosts. At the same time, I noticed an old man's ghost sitting next to our pregnant teacher, staring at her bulging belly. I felt Something was off, so I pretended to have a stomachache to get everyone's attention. Right. Then that girl realized I might be just like her.

Always double lock your door before going to bed. That way you can tell if what comes in is human or something else. Just type 6 6 6 in the comments and whatever comes in won't hurt you. I couldn't believe someone could do something like this. I rushed over and locked the door again, but that creepy feeling didn't go away. There seemed to be strange noises coming from the stairs, but when I went over there, I didn't see anything. I started thinking about calling the police or getting help from a priest. In the end, I didn't choose either. I just pretended to make a phone call and spoke loudly into the phone saying honey, how long until you get home? Two minutes. Okay then. I thought this would scare off the intruder. Sure enough, it wasn't long before the sounds from the stairs stopped. But the door next to the stairs was open, which meant the intruder might have gone inside. I quickly went to the kitchen to find a knife. Whether it's human or ghost, seeing this should definitely scare them off. I pushed the door open hard. There was nothing inside. Next I went to the walk in closet. Still nothing there. I searched every room in the house, but didn't find any sign of anyone. The intense anxiety made me too scared to go upstairs to sleep. I planned to go stay at a hotel for the night. But then felt like leaving home over these paranoid thoughts. Was making a big deal out of nothing. After thinking for a moment, I decided to go upstairs anyway. But before going up, I left a note on the floor so that mysterious intruder could leave right away. After getting into my warm bed, I finally didn't feel so scared anymore. But just as I was relaxing, I caught something in the corner of my eye. I was right by the door. I was certain it wasn't human. The key to my bedroom door suddenly dropped to the floor. This meant that thing had gotten in. I was breathing heavily from nervousness. I was about to get out of bed, but pulled back because that thing might be under the bed. I immediately grabbed my phone, wanting to take a photo to see what was under the bed. After taking the photo, I quickly checked it. There was a dark shadow under the bed. I had no idea what it was. But just then.

He carefully checked for snake bites. Just as Owen was turning around, a large snake suddenly appeared behind him. Jack quickly covered the snake with a box. At that moment, the child's parents rushed home. They were also startled when they saw the snake. Paul continued searching the rooms carefully looking for other snakes. The child's mother suddenly asked where Lisa was. At that point, we realized Lisa had been missing all along. We immediately turned around to check the laundry room. I was the first to reach the laundry room and found Lisa collapsed on the floor with snakes crawling around her. After talking with the homeowner, we Learned more about the situation.

We immediately took action, using the fire extinguishers to successfully disperse the snakes, then quickly carried Lisa out to safety.

So I kept poking it at my face, but it wouldn't go in no matter how hard I tried. That's when mom had enough. She took the pacifier and threw it on the cutting board. Weird thing is, our whole family had no mouths. Neither did the people on TV. The news anchor talked into the mic forever but couldn't get a single word out. Referees couldn't blow their whistles. Singers couldn't sing. Other kids couldn't blow bubbles either. Dad was worried sick watching all this. His face was turning red from stress, but still couldn't say a word. Then the phone suddenly rang. Mom rushed to answer it but could only make mumbling sounds while she was distracted. I snuck over to grab the pacifier from the cutting board, but since I wasn't tall enough, I accidentally knocked the board down. Hearing the noise, mom and dad rushed over. I was crying my eyes out from the pain. I picked up the pacifier and put it in my mouth and stopped crying. My parents were completely shocked seeing this. They had no idea how I got a mouth. Dad came over and kept pulling the pacifier out and putting it back in. Then dad grabbed a fruit knife and made a cut on his own face and boom, he had a mouth. Mom was super jealous. She signaled for dad to do the same for her. So Dad went ahead and did it. Mom was thrilled. Then someone knocked on the door. It was the delivery guy. He saw that dad actually had a mouth and could make sounds. The delivery guy immediately grabbed his pen and started poking his face. This scene instantly drew a crowd. They all started copying him using whatever tools they had to make mouths. This one influencer was really smart, though. He posted his mouth making video online and it went viral worldwide. It started a global mouth making craze. People used all kinds of crazy methods. Some used drawers, some used chainsaws, some even used boomerangs. People finally experienced the joy of having a mouth.

Not far away, a motorcycle pulled up beside her. The bodyguard trailed behind, and the girl could only pretend to draw his gun, hoping to scare the rider off. But the man didn't flinch. He even snapped a photo of the girl before speeding away on his bike. As he passed the bodyguard, the bodyguard caught sight of a tattoo on his hand. That reaction was not something an ordinary person would show. The man's name was Jack. He had once served in the Special Forces. After retiring, he took a job as a bodyguard at the mansion. His main duty was to protect Amy. Because Amy was mischievous, she often tried to sneak out. Though nothing serious happened this time, the employer was furious, blaming Jack harshly. But the employer's wife defended him. After all, Amy was only 9 years old and it was natural for her to want to play outside. Later, the employer relented and allowed them to go out for a stroll. Jack drove, acting as both chauffeur and guard, taking the mother and daughter to the mall. Then Jack spotted that same motorcycle again and his instincts went on high alert. They rushed back to the car, ordered the mother and daughter to fasten their seatbelts and sped away from the mall. The two were pale with fear. They clearly recognized the men chasing them. Jack managed to shake off the pursuers once they were safely home. He sat Amy down and asked what had really happened. This time, Amy stopped hiding the truth. She finally told Jack the long buried secret of her family.

But this guy charged straight at me without hesitation, pulling out a second axe he'd stashed by the door. After a brief silence, I headed for the door, only to get ambushed by the thug. Caught off guard, he knocked the gun out of my hand. Just as he was about to take me down, I suddenly shoved him hard, then stepped on a stool and landed a solid back kick, sending the thug stumbling. Finally, I threw him into the corner. A gunshot rang out and he went down. But I wasn't done yet. I walked gracefully toward the bus. Soon I got on, an old man slowly rose from his seat, revealing he was my real target. The old man quickly pulled a gun from his bag, trying to find an opening to take me out. But I was faster.

There has to be a reason. But I have been poked, prodded, scanned, cut open, and no one ever finds anything. Lisa, I can't even imagine your frustration. But I don't need sympathy. I need you to fix me. We'll do our best. Unfortunately, that does require more pokes, prods, x rays, scans. How bad? It looks like there's mildly descended loose. A small bowel? Could be a partial obstruction. I'm not sure. If it were an obstruction, I expect the bowel to be a lot more dilated than it is. So What, we just agree to disagree? I mean, that doesn't help her. Damn it! I know something's causing her pain. It's in there. Just don't know what it is. Can't see it. Um, Kira, build this scan into a high RES 3D rendering.

Why? None of the books say anything about avoiding sex. We're done here. I think there's something you should know, Mr Kim. Everything okay? Throat's just a little dry. Is there any way I can get some water? Definitely. Your color is a bit off. You had any fever, headaches? I'm probably just worn down from the travel. How about I give you a quick look so you run a few tests. But Shannon. Oh, go ahead, honey. You do look a little pale. I'll have you back in no time. Here's the thing. You did test inconclusive for Zico. Really? Zika? How? I'm wondering that myself. And there hasn't been a case of Zika reported north of the Mason Dixon line. Regardless, the first thing we have to do is test Shannon. Shannon, why? Well, since Zika can be sexually transmitted, Shannon could contract it, leaving the fetus at risk of developing microcephaly, the devastating birth defect where the baby's brain doesn't form properly. But we haven't had sex in a week. I've been out of town. And you couldn't have gotten Zeke in Buffalo, so you must have picked it up before that. It's important we test her. I don't want to scare her needlessly. Besides, I'm feeling much better. Probably just had a touch of the flu. Mr Kim, I really need to get back to Shannon. I'm sorry. Am I, am I missing something here? Okay. I wasn't in Buffalo. I was in Aruba with a lady friend. Look, I'm not concerned with your personal life. I only care about my patient. And in this situation, we have to consider your wife. No, she does not find out about this. I'm not risking my marriage over an inconclusive test. I don't think you understand. Your baby's at risk. Shannon needs to know. Dr Halstead, they teach you about doctor patient confidentiality in med school, cause they definitely covered it in law school. I'm your patient, too, now, and I'm telling you to keep your mouth shut. Well, we have to test Shannon. We can't. Not without violating his confidentiality. He refuses to tell her. That's ridiculous. I mean, even if he's HIV positive, we could break confidentiality. Doesn't zika get the same exemption? No. Unfortunately, Zika's so new, there's no legal precedent. But what if they have sex? What if he infects the fetus? I mean, you've seen babies with microcephaly. Natalie, I have spent the last hour trying to find a way around HEPA. I've got nothing. And you'll come after the hospital and my license, incidentally. So you're just giving up. There's nothing we can do. We can't justify breaking the law over an inconclusive test result. I know what you're thinking. Don't do anything. Avoid sexual contact. Why? None of the books say anything about avoiding sex. We're done here. I'm sorry. I. I think, I think there's something you should know, Mr Kim. This is Dr Ellen Hart Epidemic. Intelligence Service officer for the CDC. May I speak to you in private, Mr Kim? No, you can't. My wife and I are on our way out. I'm sorry, but federal law requires that I speak to you about your test. What, what, what's going on? Dr Hart will fill you in.

Raspé la fecha del recibo. La raspé hasta dejarla completamente limpia. Luego cambié la fecha con un bolígrafo. Me añadí 10 años de un solo trazo. Después, recorté el nombre del recibo destruido. Lo pegué con cuidado sobre el nombre verdadero. A continuación venía el paso más importante, saqué el modelo de avión que había dejado en remojo. Despejé lentamente el logotipo de la aerolínea. Lo pegué en la esquina del recibo. El cheque falso de la compañía aérea quedó terminado. Cuando fui al banco a cobrarlo, la chica de la ventanilla casi descubrió el engaño. Por suerte, soy guapo, la distraje con palabras dulces. El cheque se cobró sin problemas. Después de saborear el éxito, compré más modelos de avión y hice más cheques con credenciales falsas de piloto y cheques falsos. Cambié una y otra vez dinero en efectivo. Me volví cada vez más audaz. Empecé a viajar en avión gratis. Incluso me sentaba directamente en la cabina, fingiendo ser parte de la tripulación. Desde entonces, solo viajo en los aviones de esa compañía. Cobro cheques en todo el país. Una vez, mientras cobraba, hablé con un empleado del banco. Le saqué información sobre la tecnología antifalsificación de los cheques. Inmediatamente fui a una subasta. Compré una máquina de impresión profesional. La escala se hizo cada vez mayor. Finalmente, atrajo la atención del FBI. Cometí delitos por todo el país. Dejé un montón de pruebas. Menos de un año ya había estafado varios millones de Dólares. Una vez el agente hanrati, siguiendo el rastro de los cheques, encontró mi residencia, pero no tenía ni idea de cómo era yo. Cuando irrumpió en mi habitación, salí tranquilamente del baño y me encontré justo frente a él. No me puse nervioso en absoluto, incluso le expliqué en el acto las herramientas de falsificación. Mi actuación confundió a Jan. Rati pensó que yo también era policía. Le dije a la gente que había llegado tarde, que yo era del servicio secreto y que mi compañero ya había arrestado al sospechoso. El agente me pidió mi identificación sin dudarlo. Saqué mi cartera justo cuando estaba a punto de abrirla. Señalé por la ventana. Le dije que mi compañero y el sospechoso estaban allí, pero en realidad era solo mi vecino. Intercambié unas palabras con el vecino. El agente creyó por completo. Tomé las supuestas pruebas y me marché con Aires de triunfo. El agente aún me gritó desde atrás. Olvidaste tu cartera. Después de que me fui, hanrati recordó abrir la cartera para verificar la identidad y dentro solo había unas pegatinas de dibujos animados. Logré engañarlo con éxito y para entonces ya había huido muy lejos.

El anciano levantó su pistola temblando, pero antes incluso de poder apuntar, la mujer disparó con ambas pistolas a la vez y el anciano cayó muerto en el acto. Solo cuando confirmó que no había más movimiento, la mujer guardó sus pistolas ray. Después tomó un bolso de lona de debajo del asiento. Dentro estaba el objetivo de su viaje. Resultó que todo lo que había sucedido aquí fue porque el anciano, junto con el grupo criminal detrás de él, había extorsionado 1000000 al novio de la mujer. Para recuperar el Dinero, la mujer había venido con armas para reclamar lo que le debían, lo que llevó a la escena del principio. En este momento, el cerebro detrás del plan que se escondía en algún lugar de la distancia, no tenía idea de que un gran desastre estaba a punto de caerle encima

Después de eso, la mayoría de las armas se atascaban o no expulsaban las vainas. Pero hubo un arma que siguió funcionando sin problema alguno. Era el rifle más famoso del mundo, el ak 47. El hombre que creó esta arma se llamaba kalashniko. Solía conducir un tanque, pero durante una batalla, su tanque fue alcanzado por fuego enemigo y explotó, hiriendo gravemente su brazo. Camino al hospital, notó que los rifles de los soldados no funcionaban bien. Los cargadores se dañaban con el agua y los resortes eran tan débiles que se congelaban con el frío. Armas así podían costar vidas. Fue entonces cuando se le ocurrió la idea de crear su propia arma. Después de recuperarse, volvió a su viejo taller mecánico y dijo que quería construir una arma nueva. Conocía bien las máquinas, así que le dieron un cuarto pequeño. En solo 3 días diseñó el primera k 47. Su mano aún no había sanado del todo, así que pidió ayuda a algunos trabajadores. Juntos, trabajaron duro y construyeron el primera k 47. Ahora era momento de probarlo. Un trabajador tomó el arma y disparó a un tambor. La bala lo atravesó por completo. Luego disparó de nuevo y cada tiro dio justo en el blanco. El poder del arma quedó demostrado. Después de esto, kalashniko fue a la oficina del ejército para que aprobaran el arma. Pero en cuanto el guardia la vio, lo Confundieron con un terrorista y lo detuvieron más tarde. Cuando un oficial probó el arma por sí mismo, quedó impactado. Era mejor que todas las demás, pero según las reglas, el arma solo podía aprobarse si ganaba la competencia anual de tiro. El oficial llamó a un general. El general también probó el arma y quedó muy impresionado. El general le dijo a kalashnikov que participara en la competencia en nombre del ejército. Fue al instituto de armamento en moscú, donde recibió un cuarto propio. Pero en la primera prueba su arma falló y fue rechazada. Se sintió muy decepcionado y empezó a regresar a casa, pero en el camino un oficial lo detuvo. El oficial le dio otra oportunidad para construir una ametralladora. Kalashnikov tomó la oportunidad en serio y trabajó duro.

Una vez que se fija en alguien, esa persona quedará atrapada de forma irremediable. Solo podrá liberarse cuando la caja del demonio sea entregada a la siguiente persona. Cuando el doctor vio la caja por primera vez, sintió que algo no estaba bien. Sin embargo, no le dio mucha importancia. Simplemente ordenó a su asistente que observara de cerca la caja, pero el asistente cayó accidentalmente en la trampa. Bajo la amenaza del actual portador de la caja. Tomó la caja y esta lo fijó de inmediato. Cuando el asistente se dio cuenta de que algo andaba mal, ya era demasiado tarde. Miró impotente como los 2 primeros portadores de la caja se desvanecían en estrellas. En ese momento, el doctor aún no sabía el destino del asistente. El asistente había entregado la caja a un hombre lagarto y el doctor finalmente pudo rastrear la caja de nuevo. Se sorprendió al contactar con el asistente, pero este solo pudo decir en un tono desesperado, no lo decepcionaré y luego también se convirtió en estrellas. El doctor se dio cuenta de que la situación era extremadamente crítica. El hombre lagarto notó la especial atención del doctor y quería que él se llevara la caja, pero el doctor seguía en alta alerta. Una mujer que estaba de pie al lado vio el enfrentamiento entre los 2 y de repente se adelantó y le robó la caja. La mujer quedó controlada por la caja. El hombre Lagarto se despertó de inmediato. No sabía qué estaba haciendo. Solo sabía que iba a desaparecer antes de que el doctor pudiera actuar. La mujer corría hacia la puerta y estaba a punto de seguir propagando la caja. El doctor abrió la caja de inmediato y se quedó sorprendido al descubrir que la caja contenía un miniplaneta. Además, la caja podía hablar.

La mujer le rogaba ansiosamente que cerrara la caja. Él cerró la caja. Sin embargo, el peligro no había desaparecido. Después de cerrar la caja, se abrió una ranura para ingresar un código y la cuenta regresiva marcaba 15 segundos. En ese momento crítico, otro doctor arrel apareció.

En su lugar, fui a la habitación de ambos. Vi el dormitorio hecho un desastre. Mi corazón se hundió al instante. Mi esposa no tenía ni idea de que yo ya había vuelto antes de tiempo hasta que cayó el sol. Mi esposa regresó a casa apresuradamente. Cuando me vio, se quedó asombrada y me abrazó nerviosa, preguntándome con preocupación por qué había vuelto antes. No respondí directamente, sino que le pregunté dónde había estado. Al ver que mi esposa seguía mintiendo, decidí darle una última oportunidad, pero ella aún intentaba evadir la verdad. Desenmascaré su secreto, saqué la pistola con determinación y apreté el gatillo sin dudar. El disparo alertó al trabajador de afuera. Corrió a golpear la puerta, preguntando qué había pasado, pero disparé 2 veces más hacia la ventana, asustando al trabajador que huyó de inmediato. Luego disparé una vez más al aire y moví el cuerpo de mi esposa a otra posición. Recogí los casquillos, borré las pruebas y los arrojé de nuevo al suelo. Me quité la ropa y la quemé. Finalmente, me lavé con agua caliente para eliminar toda evidencia del asesinato. Después de completar todo esto, no elegí escapar, sino esperar la llegada de la policía. La policía llegó rápidamente la escena del crimen. Tomé el teléfono con calma y solicité que un oficial llamado Nick entrara a negociar. Este hombre estaba confundido porque él no era un negociador experto. Ambos bajamos nuestras armas. Nick era precisamente el hombre que había tenido una aventura con mi esposa, pero él no me conocía en absoluto. Sabía quién era la mujer en la villa. Hasta que vio las fotos en la pared. No se dio cuenta de que era mi esposa. Corrió rápidamente hacia ella y descubrió que aún respiraba. En ese momento levanté la pistola de nuevo. Nick sintió un escalofrío en la espalda, me quitó la pistola de un golpe y me tiró al suelo. Los demás policías entraron en masa y lograron someterme. La policía comenzó inmediatamente a rescatar a mi esposa. Los ojos de nick estaban llenos de odio y en ese momento, sentado en el coche patrulla, le mostré una sonrisa siniestra. Todo estaba saliendo según mi plan. La policía recopiló pruebas suficientes en la escena. Nick estaba decidido a no dejarme quedar impune. Encontró al fiscal a cargo del caso y entregó mi declaración mientras repetía la situación en la escena, el joven y prometedor fiscal le aseguró que no se preocupara porque en este campo tenía una tasa de condena del 97%. Al día siguiente, el fiscal comenzó a organizar los documentos relacionados. Pensaba que este caso era pan comido. No solo me habían capturado en el acto, sino que además yo había firmado una confesión. Todos pensaban que esto era solo un trámite. Pronto comenzó la audiencia preliminar de Rutina en el tribunal, pero lo que hice a continuación dejó a todos en la sala completamente atónitos

Como profesional experimentado, no dudó y ajustó nuevamente el mira para apuntar al objetivo de nuevo. Pero al segundo siguiente no pudo evitar mirar a la mujer una vez más. Para su sorpresa, descubrió que su frecuencia cardíaca había subido instantáneamente a 101 latidos por minuto. Después de calmar sus nervios, bloqueó el mira en la cabeza del objetivo nuevamente y apretó el gatillo sin dudarlo, quién sabe, pero golpeó a la mujer. El sicario intentó disparar otra vez, pero los guardaespaldas ya habían cerrado las cortinas. No tuvo más remedio que abandonar la misión y evacuar la escena. Inmediatamente, empacó su rifle francotirador lo más rápido posible, se puso el casco que había preparado con anticipación y se marchó en motocicleta a máxima velocidad. En su ruta de escape, arrojó sus herramientas al alcantarillado. Al pasar por un puente, también tiró el casco al río. Al llegar al hotel reservado con anterioridad, se quitó toda la ropa y se lavó cada parte de su cuerpo a fondo. Antes de salir, incluso roció perfume para cubrir cualquier rastro de su presencia. Luego llamó a un taxi. Después de confirmar que nadie lo seguía, arrojó el revólver que llevaba para defensa personal en un cubo de basura. Mike, que había sido sicario durante 20 años, nunca había fallado en una misión. Esto se debía, precisamente a que cuidaba cada detalle para Garantizar que nada saliera mal. Después de abordar el avión, Mike permaneció altamente alerta. Claro que sí. Poco después del despegue, notó a un hombre con traje que lo observaba secretamente una y otra vez.

Dentro había mucho dinero en efectivo y un cadáver se asustó y cerró la tapa. Volvió a abrir la tapa, se aseguró de no haberse equivocado. El dinero era real y el cadáver también. El miedo fue devorado por la codicia. Sacó todos los billetes, eran 3000000 de dólares y los guardó en un almacén. Pero justo cuando había escondido el dinero y apagó la luz, apareció una figura extraña en la esquina. Corrió al patio, abrió la caja, el cadáver seguía allí.

Pero al segundo siguiente, el traje negro colgado junto a la ventana se deslizó de golpe, lo asustó y retrocedió 3 pasos. Salió al patio y no vio nada. El pánico casi le impidió respirar. Desesperado, volvió a meter todo el dinero en la caja e incluso clavó clavos para sellarla por completo. Desde ese día fue despertado cada noche por pesadillas y curioso, arrancó los clavos para comprobar si todo había sido producto de su imaginación. Sin embargo, el cadáver dentro de la caja seguía allí, inmóvil y El dinero no había sido tocado. Encontró una llave desconocida en un rincón. La llave abrió el sótano de su casa y en el instante en que bajó se derrumbó. Allí había apilados más cadáveres. Hizo llamar a la policía, pero eso significaba entregar los 3000000, así que al final no hizo nada para esclarecer la verdad. Llenó su casa de cámaras. A medianoche, la alarma sonó de repente. Revisó las cámaras con prisa, pero un rayo cayó y la casa se quedó sin electricidad. Cuando volvió la luz, la imagen se había congelado. En la puerta de la habitación estaba de pie esa figura. El hombre, muy enojado, tomó un palo para ir tras la figura, pero al salir pisó vidrio roto. Sin importarle el dolor, llegó al patio trasero, abrió la caja de madera y el cadáver seguía inmóvil, lo que lo hizo colapsar al día siguiente.

He quickly hid the letter. Claimed he was just there to clean. The detective knew he was lying, but without proof, couldn't do much. At that moment, he realized I was framing him. Even his sister started to wonder. Did he really kill me? Because just yesterday, that stupid man smiled for the media. Everyone confused. How could he smile after his wife went missing with no explanation? Blood test results came back. Confirmed the blood was mine. My disappearance became a homicide case. My foolish husband, to keep up appearances, held a prayer meeting for me. Asked everyone to help find clues. Used the chance to clear his name. He said he would cooperate with police, but never hire a lawyer. He wanted to prove his innocence. Just as everyone applauded his heartfelt speech, my female neighbor suddenly screamed from the crowd. Where's your wife, Nick? What did you do to your pregnant wife?

She's very tacky. Let's hook her up to a couple more bottles of a house red. You have to describe. Sure. So you see, beat the ONC hematologist. We need to discuss plasma and cryo and all that. What's she had in the way of neutraceuticals? Just Centrum and a Centrum infusion. That's running. Can I give her some misoprostol? Hopefully with a little carboprost first. Carboprost. Good point. We're gonna run through the 4 TS tone. Uterus is boggy. Uh, she's had cytometrin. Cytotrophoblast infusion is running, and she's having carbocross tissue. Was the placenta complete? Yes. Trauma? Any tears? No. Uh, thrombin? Any potential mystery? Um, nothing. Right. Make sure to send a clotting in and plug on it. Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. I completely forgot exam results were out yesterday. I passed. That's amazing. Schroeder's well done. I mean, obviously you did. Oh, you. We need to celebrate. What are you doing tomorrow night? I'm off after nights.

Teach your mama some respect. Get that hoe off the streets. Look, reserve the evidence. I'm gonna take our friend back to the shop. I, I can take him, sir. No, I got it. Come on. Let's go, son.

I told you to guard the drugs. I remember calling for backup. We were In the neighborhood. What's going on? Well, this rookie doesn't know how to follow orders. Yeah, I was just, um, making sure you are all right. And my last rookie did everything I told him to. Guy's name is Owens. You know him. I got nothing to say to you. You have plenty to say to Doug, though. What happened to cops having each other's backs? Yeah, Tim has mine. Who are you? The cop you just screwed over. Why did you do it? Who protects blue? Look, are you actually cool with all this? I didn't make waves and Doug hooked me up with a spot on Metro. So what's the point of me throwing myself off? I gotta get what's mine and I advise you do the same because Doug's not going down without a fight. Sir, hang on a second. What is it, officer? I hate to do it, but I had to write a blue page up on the kid. He disobeyed direct orders because Jackson broke the chain of custody. But I can personally attest Officer West being the solid cop, but as his training officer, it'd be a dereliction of duty for me to let this slide.

We even brought up the prospect of silent lunch, she said she's a powerful woman who will not let her voice be stifled. Kind of hard to argue with that, seeing as I'm a cisgender straight man marinating in white privilege. The district had me take an online seminar, so I'm both woke and duly chastened. I know what's going on. I taught in a kind of lesson about standing up for herself, and it may have gotten a little out of hand. I'll take care of it. Thanks. We cool? No, we not cool.

Oh, honey, you misinterpreted. She wasn't looking at you. No. You didn't see she did. She. She. She looked at me. It was same feeling today when the police stopped me. It was such dislike. It just seems so primitive sometimes. Yeah, well, all religious beliefs seem primitive when they're not your own. But to cover them up and hide them away. Are they so afraid of women's sexuality or what? No, no, no. That's not the reason. Iranian women like to wear the chador. It's a Mark of respect. You know, when the Shah tried to ban them, they had demonstrations in the streets. Most women wanted to bring it back. Sorry. I know it's a different culture. I guess I just don't understand it.

You set me up. Now I'm hunting you. Set up? Such a harsh term. I made sure you were guided to me so I could help you. The only reason I agreed to this shit is cause I thought I was dying. You were dying? No money, no career, no future. When was the last time you really lived? I. Screw it. I'm going to the cops. You have to tell them what? You don't know my real name, where I am. Conversely, I not only know a lot about you, I know a lot about your wife. Like where she's been every moment since the hunt started. In fact, I have a dear friend looking after her as we speak. My wife never agreed to this. Game hunters can't go near her. It isn't a hunter. It's a dear friend of yours who knows you best. Your habits, your running routine, your water stash at the Carrington Luger. And your best friend. We found a man who watched you enter a white collar world while his collar remained a permanent shade of blue. He's angry and desperate. Fifty grand to drug your water? Oh, god. God isn't organized enough to pull off what I do. Fraudulent doctors, bogus orderlies. I spent a fortune getting you into this hunt. And if you think you can punch out just because things aren't exactly how they seemed, then think again. Provided, of course, that you survive the next 90 minutes. You're insane. All the greats are. I understand you literally ran into my associate Connell in the projects. He says you now have a gun. Guns are against the rules. Well, rules are out the window, asshole. Okay, have it your way. I notify the remaining hunters that guns are now permitted. It's only fair. Nothing about this has been fair. I admit your entry into this game was not exactly forthright. But the objective remains the same. You make it till sunrise, you win. Trust me on that. I'm a man of my word. Yeah, Carl. I'm recommending termination. Who are you tied as a wild card now? The investors are aware that puts us all at risk. In the 2 thousand years since these games began, since the bravest Roman heroes shunned the coliseums. For you're a competition. We have never seized the game. Pride to conclusion. And I'm not about to have the history of what's been built over millennia die on my watch. We just have to motivate our run a little more. Make sure he understands there is a price to pay if he goes rogue.

MTX received a 420 million dollar settlement from the insurance company, but the policy stipulates the money be spent on drilling another well. Cammy, there are timelines that must be met. Geological survey by a certain point, environmental review by another point. Typically, the insurance company pays as new expenses are incurred, but in this instance, they paid the entire settlement in advance. Well, where's that money now? Well, that's what we need to find out. Let us do some digging. I'll reach out to Planet's attorney and explain our change of control and intent to. Intent to comply. What do you mean, comply to what? It means we need to drill a gas well out in the ocean, Cammy. We got to do it pretty quick. So let us circle up over here, and I'll come before work tomorrow and walk you through all this nature. And Rebecca, stay on line, all right? Call me back, Tommy. Yes, ma'am, I will. You thinking what I'm thinking? Now we know where the money came from for the workover field. Rebecca, you go To Fort Worth. Silver linings attorney. Cause if this stuff gets out, banks will start calling notes. I should be in that meeting. Tommy, Rebecca doesn't have any experience in offshore drilling or the timelines required to get a project like this up and running. Nate, we don't have the 400 million to drill. She don't need experience with all short drilling. She needs experience of bullshitting. So, Rebecca, you get us as much lead time as possible. Nate, you find the money. All right, I'll talk to y'all later.

I want you to think of it as a testament to my faith in you because for the first time I truly believe that we could do something special. Where was that yesterday? That was the other woman I was looking for. Really catch. You think we could be great? I specifically said you have the potential to be great. Yeah.

I guess you guys are wondering what I'm doing with your shoes. Right, they don't have any laces. Well, they will after I teach you to properly tie them. Um, we're in high school, we know how to tie shoes. Yeah, but not the right way. I'm gonna teach you my system of basketball from the ground up on this court. Every move you make, every play, every lace is gonna be done the exact same way every time until we don't have to think about it because thinking is what slows us down. Alright, come on, grab your shoes, grab your laces, let's start from scratch.

It was a bar and some drinks and then just sex. Sex? Was she saying that you raped her? Now, one woman makes an accusation, maybe, right? Your word against hers. But two women who don't remember consenting to sex, two women who felt incapacitated. no, no, They were incapacitated. Drugging women and raping a miss. I did not give them any drugs. When we search your apartment, what will we find? Not drugs. Look, I, I, I kind of take these girls to bars that pour strong drinks, and they're maybe really strong, but it, it's just cause it, it makes it easier to relax because the dating world is brutal, you know? Ever get any complaints about customers being drugged here? Not that I've heard, but I get it. When I cover the bar, I keep an eye out. Can you tell us who else is on the schedule that night? We were down two regulars. Manager called in a freelancer. Here is his photo and profile. Ash Gordon. Son of a bitch. This is the guy you asked me about the other day, right? You mean when you lied to us, or. I just didn't remember him because I serve 100 people a night, six nights a week. I called you six times over the last six months. I give out my number to lots of customers. I have a following. Okay, well, the last two times, You poured for Luke. His dates ended up unconscious and sexually assaulted. What's that have to do with me? You tell us. Poor boy. Look, I'm not stingy with the alcohol. These women, they have no problem letting guys buy them drinks all night. They can't hold their liquor, that's on them. That he has an accomplishment. Luke took his dates to two different bars in two different boroughs. Same bartender, Ash Gordon, was at both of them. Now, Jill and Rebecca didn't drink a lot, and yet they both ended up with a significant memory. Folks, you think ash is the one who did the actual drugging? Maybe. He was a chemistry major in college who got kicked out for conducting unauthorized recreational drug trials in the lab. It's interesting. So on his computer, search history was erased, but I did find this folder labeled Luke. Half a dozen video files labeled with dates. Anything in the last four months? Yeah, three right here. Open them. I'm. I'm trying, but it looks like these files were created in exchange using an encrypted app. It'll take some time. Sorry, guys. Huff and puff all you want, but that's not happening. Get him out of here. These two files, they match the dates of your rapes. And there's four other folders with other guys names. Five or six files in each. So we could be looking at 25 more rapes. SVU has arrested Luke Mitchell, charged with raping two women. We Believe that he has an accomplice. And we believe that there are other women who have not yet reported their assaults. Mr. Mitchell connected with both victims on a dating app called True Heart. He met Jane Doe one at a bar in lower Manhattan and Jane Jane Doe 2 in a bar in Williamsburg. Now, both of these victims experienced confusion, disorientation, and memory loss. And we believe that these women, and possibly others, were drugged and raped. Your decision to go on a date and consume alcohol with someone does not give them permission to rape you. Doing so is a crime that we at SVU and the DA's office are taking very seriously.

Really? It's. It's a string. How hard can it be? It's. It's straight. It's in a loop. It gets knotted up with other strings.

Do you understand? I. I think so. Okay, Jody, Dr. Archer and I are gonna step outside. We'll be right back. Okay, that was not an informed consent. Postictal confusion from the seizure. Could be or could be another complication from the tumor. There were some glimpses of recognition, though. Yeah, I'll call psych, get their take. Okay, so there's a slowness to Jody's thought process that's evident. But she grasped that she's ill, that there's a tumor present that we recommend to be resected, and the consequences if she doesn't have surgery. Four for four. Sounds like she's capable of consent. So I'll get it, and then I'll get her up to the OR. The hospital's new AI, peg Jody as a drug seeker. We almost let her walk because of an algorithm. Opiates are a problem. I get building tools to help solve it. Yeah, except patients are falling through the cracks. Well, luckily, Not today, no. But I'm worried about tomorrow

Vio al hombre enterrar la bomba en la roca. Era un saboteador. El francotirador apretó el gatillo. De inmediato, la bala alcanzó al hombre. Él cayó de rodillas. La misión del francotirador era eliminar amenazas potenciales y asegurar que las fuerzas blindadas pudieran seguir avanzando. Justo cuando los francotiradores se preparaban para retirarse, ben notó algo extraño. En la carretera había 3 manchas de color diferente. Ben ordenó al francotirador disparar hacia ellas. El primer disparo salió. No hubo reacción. El francotirador hizo un segundo disparo aún sin respuesta. Para estar completamente seguro, ben ordenó un tercer disparo. Al segundo siguiente, ocurrió una explosión. Ben y su equipo fueron alcanzados por la onda expansiva. De repente, apareció un gran grupo de terroristas armados. Claramente ya estaban emboscados allí. Al darse cuenta de la trampa, se retiraron rápidamente, pero el enemigo los persiguió sin descanso. A medida que los perseguidores aumentaban en número, el escuadrón divisó un pueblo. Apenas entraron al pueblo, fueron atacados con intenso fuego desde todas direcciones. Los soldados quedaron completamente atrapados y apenas podían respirar. En un momento crítico, un lanzacohetes voló hacia ellos, abriendo un gran agujero en la pared. El escuadrón aprovechó para esconderse en una casa. Los aldeanos al ver a los soldados, huyeron asustados a sus hogares. Solo un hombre permaneció tranquilo, mirando al escuadrón. De repente, una granada fue lanzada adentro. El hombre la recogió con sus propias manos y la arrojó afuera. Todos quedaron atónitos. Él Les hizo señas para que se ocultaran dentro de la casa. No tuvieron otra opción que cubrirse rápidamente. Una vez dentro, el escuadrón preparó sus armas, listos para combatir. Pero el hombre tranquilamente comenzó a atenderlos. Los soldados estaban confundidos. De pronto, la pared de tierra fue volada, abriendo un hueco, el hombre salió caminando lentamente. Momentos después se escucharon disparos. Justo cuando el escuadrón pensó que el hombre había muerto, él regresó ileso

Justo cuando iba a atacar, el avión se encontró con una fuerte turbulencia. El violento sacudón tiró a ambos al suelo. En ese instante, perdió la oportunidad perfecta para matar, y ese error sería el comienzo de su fin. De regreso en su asiento, Jimmy sintió que el paraguas a su lado ocupaba demasiado espacio, así que lo colocó entre los asientos. Inesperadamente, la punta del paraguas apuñaló al asesino que estaba detrás de él. Aún peor, la punta ya estaba cubierta con un veneno mortal. Era para matar a Jimmy, pero terminó matando a uno de los suyos en menos de 10 segundos. El asesino estaba muerto. Después de que el avión aterrizó, sacaron un cuerpo. Los cómplices pensaron que la misión había sido un éxito, pero al levantar la sábana descubrieron que el muerto era su propio hombre. Furioso, el jefe de la organización decidió actuar por sí mismo. Apenas Jimmy bajó del avión, su amigo fue a recogerlo. El asesino rubio lo siguió de cerca, adelantó su auto, se detuvo al borde de la carretera y rápidamente ensambló su rifle de francotirador. Estaba seguro. Esta vez Jimmy no sobreviviría, pero justo cuando iba a apretar el gatillo, el hijo del amigo de Jimmy abrió el paraguas. Bloqueó la vista del conductor, haciendo que el coche se moviera de un lado a otro. El asesino rubio no Podía apuntar. Su disparo golpeó accidentalmente la balsa inflable en el techo del coche. La balsa desinflada cayó como una cortina cubriendo todo el parabrisas. El conductor entró en pánico, giró el volante y se estrelló contra la orilla de la carretera, matando al asesino rubio al instante. Los del coche no sabían lo que había pasado. Tras repetidos fracasos, el líder de la organización estaba furioso. Esta vez gastó una fortuna para contratar a un asesino de clase mundial, un hombre con una tasa de éxito del 100%, capaz de matar incluso en un centro comercial lleno de gente sin perder la calma. Cuando Jimmy entró en una cabina de fotos, el asesino se deslizó silenciosamente en la cabina de al lado, colocó un silenciador en su pistola y esperó el momento en que Jimmy presionara el obturador. Un disparo a la cabeza. Misión cumplida. ¿Pero esta vez podrá el afortunado Jimmy sobrevivir de nuevo?

Cuando probé su poder, descubrí agujeros de bala en la superficie de concreto. Detrás, se levantó una enorme nube de polvo. Mi compañero se apresuró a examinar cuidadosamente. Descubrimos que el concreto no solo había sido completamente perforado, sino que el rifle había volado un agujero en la parte trasera. Incluso un edificio a lo lejos fue perforado. Para maximizar el poder del arma, instalé una batería nueva y pedí a mi compañero que preparara la cámara. Cuando disparé continuamente hacia adelante, el puente de hierro a lo lejos fue destruido instantáneamente. Llevamos rápidamente la grabación a las fuerzas militares del gobierno, esperando vender esta arma a un precio alto. Pero tom pensó que el video era falso y me exigió demostrar el arma en campo abierto. Cuando saqué algo que parecía una pistola de juguete eléctrica, tom mostró inmediatamente una expresión de desdeen. Mantuve la calma y apunté a un tanque pesado apretando el gatillo a 1km de distancia. En solo un segundo, el tanque explotó instantáneamente. Esta escena emocionó extremadamente a tom y preguntó por el precio del superrifle y la tecnología de desarrollo. Pedí 100000000 de dólares. Para mi sorpresa, aceptó el trato y acordó hacer la transacción al mediodía del día siguiente. Después de regresar, tom investigó la situación de mi familia. Pronto llegó el momento de la transacción. Pensé que todo saldría bien, pero cuando llegué al punto de encuentro, descubrí que tom no había traído dinero e incluso me amenazó Con un arma, justo cuando intentaba escapar, descubrí que mi familia había sido secuestrada. No tuve otra opción. Entregué el arma y todos los documentos relacionados. Después de verificar que los materiales eran correctos, me permitieron irme, pero lo que no sabían era que ya había instalado un rastreador en el rifle. Revisando la vigilancia podía localizar su posición. Cuando vi que su vehículo entraba en el rango de alcance, saqué rápidamente el superrifle de segunda generación. Aunque parecía una pistola de agua de juguete, su poder superaba con creces la primera generación. Tom no sabía que el peligro se acercaba. Apreté el gatillo decididamente

Oh, you know, her drinking, smoking, hitting gophers with the golf club, the usual. We should ask her and Dale to come over for dinner. Wouldn't that be nice, Jim? Well, I don't know. Drinking, smoking, do you really want that around your children? We are impressionable. Don't be silly. I'm gonna give her a call. I'll talk to her. Thank you.

Thank you. I can't believe you and I can't believe none of you told me I didn't know. Of course not, honey. I still don't know what is happening. I should have told you.

A kid in the checkout line pointed at something and said 6 seven to his mom. I froze. Was that one of my students? Or was it spreading beyond the school? At the coffee shop, I heard teenagers laughing. One of them said six, seven and they all cracked up. I left without ordering. At home, I tried to relax. I turned on the TV. A commercial came on. Now only six dollars and seventy cents. I turned it off. I couldn't escape it. That night. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about 6 7 in my head over and over. 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7. I dreamed about my students chanting it. I woke up exhausted. Monday morning, I walked into my classroom and decided, this ended today. Class, we need to talk about 6 7. 23 faces looked up at me. Why do you keep saying it? Silence. Anyone? Why 6 7? Eric raised his hand. Because it's funny. But why is it funny? More silence. Girl named Maya spoke up. It just is. But it doesn't make sense, I said. You can't answer every question with 6 7. That's not how language works. That's not how numbers work. That's not how anything works. They stared at me. So today we're making a rule. No one says 6 7 for the rest of the day. If you can do that, we get extra recess. They nodded. Seemed easy enough. First hour went fine. No one said It. I started to relax. Maybe this was it. Maybe they just needed a clear boundary. Second hour during math, I asked how many sides a triangle has. A boy named Lucas raised his hand. Three. Good, I said. Then quietly, from the back, someone whispered, six, seven. Giggles erupted. Who said that? I asked. No one answered. By lunch, five kids had broken the rule. By afternoon, they'd all given up. 6, seven. Six, seven. Six, seven. I sat at my desk and put my head in my hands. The principal walked in during the chaos. She looked at me, looked at the kids, looked back at me. We need to do something, she said. I've tried everything, I said without looking up. Maybe we just wait it out. Kids move on from things eventually. It's been almost a month. Give it time, she said, and left. I sat there while my class chanted around me. I'd lost. Completely and totally lost. There was nothing I could do. Six, seven had won. Then one Monday, it just stopped. I walked into class, racing for the chant. Nothing. They were quietly coloring like it never happened. I asked Eric why. He shrugged. That was last month. I wanted to scream.

I looked up from the chocolate frosting I was carefully spreading, confused. Invited to what? She held up her phone showing my husband's Instagram story. There he was at a fancy rooftop restaurant downtown, champagne glass raised high, surrounded by all his co workers. The caption read, celebrating 30 in style. Thanks for the surprise, everyone. Today was my 31st birthday. He was celebrating my birthday without me. Oh, was all I managed. Still holding the frosting spatula, my sister Elena stared at me in disbelief. He threw himself a party for your birthday? I set down the spatula with steady hands. Apparently so. The homemade cake I've been decorating for our supposed quiet dinner tonight suddenly looked pathetic. Three layers of chocolate with Happy Birthday half written in vanilla frosting. Let me see that again, I said. Taking her phone, I zoomed in on the video. There was Patricia from his office who he claimed annoyed him daily. His boss, Gerald, who supposedly never socialized. That new intern, Chloe, laughing at something he was saying. Twenty people total, a reserved section with decorations. Someone had ordered a professional cake visible in the background with happy 30th and gold lettering. This party had been planned weeks in advance. Invitation sent, venue booked, cake ordered, decorations arranged and not one person had thought to invite or even mention it to the actual birthday person. Elena Was already grabbing her coat. We're going down there right now. No, I said quietly. Let them have their party. Are you insane? It's your birthday. I looked at my homemade cake, the grocery store flowers I bought myself, the nice dinner reservation for two I'd made, telling myself, you'd appreciate not having to plan anything. I wanna see how this plays out. What time was it? Posted 40 minutes ago. He'd left work early claiming he had an important client meeting. I believed him, even offered to push our dinner reservation back. Elena stayed with me, rage scrolling through social media. More videos kept appearing. Him opening presents his co workers had bought, a watch, expensive whiskey cuff links. This is Elena muttered, they know it's not his birthday, right? I pulled up Patricia's Instagram. There was a group photo caption celebrating the best boss. Happy birthday. Then Gerald's LinkedIn, honored to celebrate another year with our talented team leader. Happy 30th. They all thought it was his birthday. Every single one believed it. Which meant for weeks, maybe months, my husband had been telling people his birthday was October 15th, my birthday. His actual birthday was in March, six months away. At six PM, he texted client, dinner running long. Start without me. I texted back, no problem, take your time. Then I did something unprecedented. I took a selfie with my homemade cake and posted it to Facebook, the one platform he never checked. But where his co Workers followed me. Caption.

FBI, open up! The battering ram hit our front door. Before I could even process what was happening, six agents in tactical gear swarmed into my room, weapons drawn, shouting commands. One agent ripped my headset off. Another yanked me out of my gaming chair. My mom was screaming, down! There's hands behind your back! I put my hands up immediately, watching my Fortnite character get eliminated. On screen, final two players. I've been so close. They cuffed me and sat me on my bed. Agent searched everything. My PC, my phone, my notebooks, my closet. Mom and dad were brought upstairs. Both of them look terrified. The lead agent was a woman with short gray hair. She pulled out a tablet and held it toward my parents. Your son has been making terroristic threats. We have recordings. My balls dropped to the floor. She pressed play. My voice came through the speaker clear as day. Gonna eliminate everyone in the building. Nobody's getting out. Mom guessed. Dad's face went white. Wait, that's not. I started. The agent cut me off. She played another clip. My voice again. Got my explosives ready. Taking out at least 20 people. We take these threats extremely seriously. The agent said, your son's school will be shut down tomorrow. Bomb dogs are searching the building. I didn't threaten anyone. My voice was shaking. I was playing Fortnite. It's a video game. We know what Fortnite is, another agent said flatly. Bagging my gaming PC. These recordings don't sound like a game. The lead agent played another clip. Running Double Pump and AR tomorrow. Gonna be ready. Mom started crying. Dad looked at me like I was a stranger. Kevin, if you're planning something, you need to tell us right now. I'm not planning anything. It's a game. Two more agents came upstairs holding printed discord messages. They showed my parents screenshots. Hitting pleasant at three PM tomorrow. Got my whole loadout ready for this. Taking the high ground and picking everyone off. Those are locations in the game, I shouted. Strategies we use! The lead agent's face didn't change. We've contacted three of your online friends. They're being questioned right now. Miles, Terry, Zach. All three were in interrogation rooms because of me. A younger agent spoke from the doorway. His teachers say he's isolated, eats lunch alone, spends all his time gaming. The lead agent showed my parents a pamphlet titled Warning Signs of Teen Violence. She named school Shootings Columbine, Parkland, Uvalde. Each word made mom cry harder. They found my notebook with Fortnite strategies, building patterns, weapon stats, landing spots, tactical planning, the agent said, photographing every page. Dad tried to defend me. Kevin's never been violent. He's never been in a fight. That's what every parent says right before it happens, the agent replied. They bagged my controller, my headset, everything. An agent Scrolled through my YouTube history. Hours of combat footage. Been tutorials for Fortnite. I was sobbing now, chest tight. The agent's radio crackled. School sweep complete. No explosives, no weapons. Building is secure. The lead agent frowned. Could have stashed them elsewhere. She turned back to me. Where are they hidden? There's nothing to hide. My parents were whispering about lawyers. The agents pulled up more recordings. My voice saying, pushing now. Throwing grenades. Full squad wipe. Nobody's surviving this.

I said no. I hung up. 20 minutes later, mom called. She was hysterical. Dad got on the other line. They'd already talked to Ryan and decided I should help him. He's your brother, mom kept saying. He made a mistake, but he has a family. He has responsibilities. You're young. You'll bounce back. Dad reminded me they paid for my entire college, $40,000. He actually said the number. This is one thing we're asking you to do. I tried explaining about my job, my apartment, my literal future. Dad cut me off. You don't even have kids, Becca. You don't understand what he could lose. That hurt. Like he was saying my life didn't matter as much because I didn't have a husband or a baby yet. For three days, they didn't stop. Ryan sent me voice messages at all hours. Some of them he was crying, some he was yelling, calling me selfish. Mom called my work phone, my work phone. She told my coworker who answered that it was a family emergency and could I please call home. Ryan's lawyer even reached out. He said if I just signed one paper and showed up to say I was driving, they could make it all go away quietly. He made it sound so simple. Just sign here, show up. Once done, I started believing maybe I was being selfish. Nobody got hurt, right? It was just a car insurance. Would cover it. Maybe my job wouldn't even find out. Maybe the bank wouldn't.

She'd been paying for everything while he told me he was saving for our future. He's been taking money from both of us, she said. I checked our joint account after you called. He's been draining it. 60,000 euros, gone. I looked at our savings account while she talked. Empty. The 40,000 we'd saved for a house. I'm flying back tonight. I said don't warn him. Wasn't planning to. I already changed the locks on our apartment. His things are in boxes in the lobby. Security has his photo. We stayed on the phone for three hours, piecing together three years of lies. Every work trip matched up with a vacation with the other. Every family emergency was a cover for time with someone else's family. He'd been living completely double lives, funded by two women who loved him a. Lotty sent me everything. Screenshots, bank records, videos. I did the same. By the time we were done, we had enough evidence to destroy him. She posted a new TikTok that night. It went viral in six hours. How? I found out my boyfriend had a whole other girlfriend. 15 million views. His co workers saw it. His parents saw it. His boss, who followed her for her Fashion content. Saw. He called me from the airport. Panic in his voice. Please don't do anything crazy. I can explain everything. Too late. Check TikTok. Then I blocked him. He came to our apartment to find his belongings in the hallway and an eviction notice on the door. The locks had been changed. His key didn't work. His credit cards were all maxed out from his double life. Both Alady and I had removed him from our accounts. He had nowhere to go. Alady and I still talk. We're both in therapy, both rebuilding. Last week, she sent me a screenshot of his new dating file. Recently out of a toxic relationship. It says we laughed until we cried. He's living with his parents now. The ones who supposedly didn't approve of me. Turns out they didn't approve of anyone. They knew exactly what their son was and wanted no part of it. Sometimes I still see him pop up on my TikTok feed. In the comments of her viral video, begging her to take it down. It has 47 million views now. The internet never forgets.

When I was 25, working at some boring accounting firm downtown, my brother Ryan called me at 2:00am. I knew something was wrong because Ryan never called that late unless he needed something. He was crying. Like, actually sobbing into the phone. He told me he'd been drinking at his buddy's place, drove home and hit a parked car on Maple Street. Hard. Then he panicked and just left. Didn't leave a note, nothing. Someone got his plate number, and the cops were looking for him. You need to say you were driving. He said, just like that, like he was asking me to pick up milk. I laughed because I thought he was joking. He wasn't. Becca, I'm serious. I'll lose everything. My job, Jamie will leave me, and I'll never see Lily again. Lily was his seven year old daughter from his first marriage. He only got her every other weekend as it was. I told him that was insane. I worked in finance. Any criminal record, even traffic stuff, could get me fired. Plus, I was literally three weeks away from closing on my first apartment. The bank lady had told me not to even jaywalk until everything was signed. He kept crying, begging, saying nobody got hurt. It was just property damage. And if I took the fall, it would barely be anything on my record because I had a clean history. For him, it Was his second DUI. He'd lose his license for years. Probably his sales job, since he drove to clients all day.

Not just any reveal either. This girl had 400,000 followers and the video already had 2 million views. There was Kalani, my boyfriend of three years, kissing her in front of the Eiffel Tower with the caption, finally showing you guys my man together 6 months. My hands went numb. Kalani was supposed to be in Phoenix for a medical conference. I checked his Instagram. He posted a photo of a conference room 12 hours ago. But the meta data on her TikTok showed it was filmed yesterday in Paris. I screenshotted everything before my brain could talk me out of it. Then I went to her profile. Hundreds of videos of them together, date nights, cooking videos, morning routines. The cooking videos were filmed in an apartment I didn't recognise. But I saw Kalani's watch on the counter, the one I'd bought him for his birthday. My stomach churned as I kept scrolling. Three months ago, she posted about meeting his parents the same weekend he told me he was visiting his sick college roommate. There was a photo of her with her mom and dad at their anniversary dinner. The dinner I wasn't invited to because it was family only. I called him immediately. He answered on the second ring, casual as ever. Hey, babe, conference is pretty boring. Missing you. My voice came out steady somehow. How's Phoenix? Hot and full of old doctors. Can't wait to come home tomorrow. I pulled up her TikTok of them at a French cafe posted an hour ago. That's funny because Phoenix looks a lot like Paris on TikTok. Silence. Then. What are you talking about? Adele Moore? Ring a bell? Your girlfriend with 400 k followers who's been posting videos of you two for six months. He hung up. I called back straight to voicemail. I was typing a text when my phone rang. Unknown number with a French country code. I answered. You're the other woman. Her accent was slight but noticeable. Adele, excuse me. Kalani told me about you months ago. His ex who could didn't let go. He said you were stalking him. That's why he had to be careful about posting our relationship. The audacity of this man. I'm not his ex. We live together. We have a lease together. I just helped him pay for his mom's surgery. She laughed, bitter and sharp. His mom's surgery. His mother hasn't been sick a day in her life. I had dinner with her last night. She keeps asking when we're getting married. My head spun. Send me proof. Within minutes, my phone flooded with photos. Then with his parents, who I've been told didn't approve of me.

Three days later, official inspectors showed up with equipment and plastic suits. They took one look behind that supply cabinet and immediately evacuated our classroom. Turns out there was a pipe leak in the ceiling that had been slowly dripping water into the wall for months. The whole back corner was basically a mold factory. Seven kids had to get blood tests and medical treatment. The school moved our entire class into the library for the rest of the year while they gutted and rebuilt that room. The renovation took four months. When local news came to interview about the mold problem, Missus Patterson told reporters she had no idea there was any issue.

What point that you were upset, but you can't run from problems. I almost laughed. I didn't run from problems. I left a situation where I was punished for self defense. Ashley stepped forward. I'm sorry for what happened. Can we move past this? What are you sorry for? I asked. The fight. Getting you in trouble. What about lying? Destroying my homework, making yourself cry to manipulate dad? Her face went red. Dad pointed at me. That's enough being disrespectful. And you suspended me from my own house for defending myself. Guess we're even. Bobby appeared from his office. I think you folks should leave. They stood there expecting me to break. I just stared back. They left. Ashley turned at the door. You'll regret this. I went back to work. That evening. I graduated high school through the night program, something they didn't even know I transferred to. Bobby, Jake and Tommy came to the ceremony, took a photo of me in my cap and gown next to my truck. My parents never showed. I never invited them. Two months later, Ashley's pregnant at 16. Father's gone. Family calls begging for help. Six months later, dad loses his job, behind on mortgage. More desperate calls. Nine months later, babies born. They're drowning. I bought my first truck. 12 months later, foreclosure notice, $12,000 behind. I had exactly that in savings. I thought about it for three days. That money could save their house, keep them from Being homeless, it would also teach them I'd come running whenever they needed rescuing, that they could treat me like garbage and I'd still be their safety net. I didn't give it to them. They lost the house, moved into a two bedroom rental, four people, one baby. Dad working retail, mom doing data entry. Ashley still living with them, unemployed. Meanwhile, Bobby made me a partner, 20% of the shop at 18. I co owned a business at 20. I bought a house. Last month, dad showed up one final time. No money request, just I was wrong about that day, about suspending you, about all of it. We're proud of what you've built. I didn't know what to say. Part of me wanted to stay angry. I appreciate you saying that. I told him. I know it's late. Yeah, it is. He left. Haven't heard from him since. I got a girlfriend who doesn't care that I'm a mechanic. She likes that I can fix thing. I've never met my niece. Don't plan to. Sometimes Bobby asks if I feel bad. I tell him the truth. I feel free. They chose Ashley over me every single time. Now they're living with that choice and I'm living with mine. The difference, I'm thriving. They're surviving. That's not revenge. That's just reality.

I just said alright. The next morning I was gone and what followed destroyed them all. My dad gave me an ultimatum, apologize to my sister Ashley for assaulting her or stay locked in my room indefinitely. No phone, no leaving except for school and meals. All because she destroyed my calculus homework, 3 hours of work and I physically removed her from my room after she shoved me first. I looked at my ruined papers dripping onto the carpet, looked at Ashley's satisfied smirk behind my dad said two words, alright. He thought I caved. I packed that night. By 6 a. M. I was at my Uncle Bobby's house with three $400 in cash I'd saved from my hardware store job. Bobby's my dad's younger brother, but they're nothing alike. Dad wears suits and works insurance. Bobby owns an auto shop and never looked down on me once. He didn't ask questions, just poured me coffee and said you can stay but you're gonna work. Started Monday at his auto shop. Minimum wage, oil changes, learning real skills, no golden child treatment, no punishments for things I didn't do, just work for pay. The double standards at home had been obvious for years. Ashley got new clothes every season while I wore hand me downs. She had no curfew. Mine was nine PM her room was private. Mine fair game for anyone when servers At restaurants would comment on the favoritism. My parents didn't even deny it. My family couldn't reach me. Dad had my phone. When mom finally got through to Bobby's landline demanding I come home, he said, kid made his choice. So did you. Then hung up. Four months in, they showed up at the shop. I was under a Honda covered in grease. Dad in his business casual, Ashley in designer clothes I'd never seen before. We want you home, mom said. You've made your point. I.

My daughter and son were 9 and 11. Perfect cousin squad. At least it used to be. Somewhere along the way, Lauren's boys became iPad kids, not normal screen time every waking moment. Breakfast in the car with ipads propped on the dashboard. Dinner at restaurants with headphones in and eyes glazed. I once saw them at the pool with their tablets and ziplock bags so they wouldn't get wet while they floated. Lauren worked long shifts as a nurse, so I never said anything.

Summer at its best, except Lauren's boys were inside on the couch, volume blasting, playing video games. Since 9 that morning, my daughter tried to get them outside for a water balloon fight. Nothing. My son offered to show them his skateboard, ignored. They wouldn't even look up. I finally walked in and paused both screens. Hey, guys, let's take a break. Go outside for a bit. Lauren appeared out of nowhere. Seriously, they've been on those since this Morning. They're missing everything. She grabbed the ipads back. They're happy. They're quiet. Mind your business.

Her grandpa hand carved her one right before he passed away, and she never put it down. After that, she spent five hours a day, every day in the backyard practicing the same movements until her palms blistered over. Teachers kept telling me to redirect her into something more normal, but I never listened to them. Staff made her happy. That's all any parent cares about. When Mira started 5th grade, she met her only real friend, a boy named Theo. He had a D H D. And she had autism, and they just fit together like a puzzle. They ate lunch together every day, did homework at our kitchen table. He even thought her staff was cool. I was so happy she made a friend. Then a 13 year old girl named Vanessa came into the picture. She never spoken to Theo before, but she started following him between classes. She wanted him to be her boyfriend. Apparently, Theo being different, intrigued her. Theo kept telling her no, but Vanessa kept pushing. The day, day after Theo publicly told her no and turned her into a meme in her class, she had enough. She cornered Theo alone behind the gymnasium. She shoved him into the brick wall over and over until His head split open, he fell down and laid on the concrete with a black, black eye, rob palms, and a gash across his forehead held together with four stitches. Vanessa had pressed Scissors to his throat before leaving. Be my boyfriend and I'll cut your face off next time. He was too scared to tell any adult, but he told Mira everything immediately. She took him back to our house and immediately where she and his wounds up before saying, Vanessa is never going to touch you again. Theo looked at Mira. What do you mean, Mira Smirk? I have grandpa's staff. I've been training for three years. She doesn't know what's coming. Theo shook his head. She's bigger than you. She's older. She's crazy. Mira didn't blink.

We've talked about noise before because I was worried about being too loud when I have people over. And she straight up told me she can't hear anything through the walls. Anyway, last weekend, Katie's mom came to visit. She was staying in Katie's room for, like, three days. I didn't think much of it, just tried to be extra quiet and respectful since there was a parent around. Friday night, I had this guy Alex come over around midnight. We were just hanging out in my room, watching stuff on my laptop, talking. Nothing crazy. Around 5:00am, we started making out. We weren't even being loud about it, just some kissing and whatever. The TV was still on low. Then out of nowhere, there's this aggressive pounding on my door, like someone trying to break it down. I jump up, and Alex literally falls off the bed. I open the door, and Katie's mom is stand. Standing there in her pajamas, looking mad as hell. Can y'all shut the fuck up? She says. Just like that? No. Hey, sorry, or could you keep it down or anything? Just straight up cursing at me. I'm standing there in shock because We genuinely weren't being loud.

Tuesday and Friday are trash days in our neighborhood, but he does it every day because she keeps forgetting which days they come. But here's the thing that really got me. That's not all he does. He also checks her mailbox and brings it inside for her. Sometimes she leaves a little note taped to her front door, and he'll go inside and help her reach things on high shelves or change a light bulb or reset her router when the internet stops working. One time, I saw him programming her TV remote because she couldn't figure out how to switch inputs. The whole routine takes about 10 to 15 minutes, depending on what she needs. That day I noticed he started keeping a small toolbox in his trunk around the same time. Now I know why. There's also a package of batteries, light bulbs, and even a step stool back there. Yesterday I finally asked him about it. I tried to be casual, like, hey, I saw you helping Mrs. Girl the other day. That's really sweet. She just shrugged and said her son lives three states away and someone should make sure she's okay, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. I pushed a little More because I wanted to understand why he never mentioned it. That's when he told me the real reason. His grandma lived alone in Ohio for six years before she passed away when he was 19. He said his family visited when they could, but they lived four hours away and his parents both worked full time.

I forced to smile. Kevin squeezed my hand under the table so hard it hurt. I thought it was a one time thing, wedding jitters maybe, but it wasn't. At our first Christmas as a married couple, his dad cornered Jason in the kitchen and while I was grabbing wine, you should sneak into their room tonight, he said loud enough for me to hear. Let's see if she notices. Jace's face went red. He told His dad to stop. His dad just laughed and walked away. Every family gathering, same joke. Easter dinner, his mom said, Jace, sit next to her, see if she realizes it's not Kevin.

My boyfriend Tanner has this weird habit of leaving for work exactly 17 minutes earlier than he needs to every single day, 6:43 on the dot. His alarm goes off at 6:15. He's dressed by 6:30 and then he's out the door. I thought maybe he just liked beating traffic or stopping for coffee on the way. But his office is literally eight minutes away and he brings coffee from home in his thermos. Didn't add up. We've been living together for two years and this started about four months ago when he switched to the morning shift. I never questioned it because honestly I'm not a morning person. I'm usually half asleep when he kisses my forehead and leaves. But this morning I had insomnia and couldn't sleep at all. So I was wide awake when he went through his usual routine. I watched him grab his keys, check his phone, kiss my forehead like always and head out the door. That's when I noticed something strange. Through our bedroom window, instead of getting in his car, he walked directly to our neighbor's house two doors down, Missus Earl's house. Missus Earl is this tiny 80 year old woman who's lived on our street for like 30 years. Her husband died last February and I remember seeing her at the funeral looking absolutely lost. Since then she's been living alone. Her son lives in Oregon and she doesn't have any other Family nearby. I got curious and honestly a little concerned. So last week, I actually set my alarm early and followed him.

But last week, something happened that made me finally break my silence. We're at my daughter's college graduation party. Big Celebration at our house. Both families there, about 40 people total. I'm in the kitchen grabbing more drinks from the garage fridge when my mother in law and sister in law walk in speaking Korean. They don't see me behind the open pantry door. He's getting fat. Did you see his stomach? I know. Poor Mira. Remember that doctor she dated before him? Park's son? He just bought his third house. At least the kids look Korean. Thank god they don't have his ugly nose and they got Mira's intelligence, not his. I'm gripping the door handle so hard my knuckles turn white. But then my mother in law says something that makes my blood run cold. I'm changing my will next week. Mira deserves the inheritance, not him. I've talked to my lawyer. There's a way to structure it so her husband can't touch a single penny. Even if they stay married, it all goes to her and the kids only. My sister in law laughs, mom, you're brilliant. He's been mooching long enough. For context, I'm a civil engineer. I make 140 k a Year. We split all expenses equally. I've never asked them for a single dollar. I stepped out from behind the pantry door. My mother in law is mid sentence when she sees me. Her eyes go wide. In perfect Korean, I said, I've understood every single word you've said about me for 25 years, every insult.

I heard what you said the night we got engaged about the grandchildren looking Korean. I heard you tell your friends at our anniversary that you were waiting for Mira to leave me. I heard every single thing. My sister in law dropped her wine glass. It shattered on the tile, red wine spreading everywhere. But neither of them moved, just stared at me like I'd grown a second head. I switched back to English, my voice completely calm. I'll be telling Mira everything tonight, every single thing you've said about me over 25 years, about her choices, about our kids, about your plans to cut me out of your will like I'm some kind of gold digger. My mother in law finally found her voice, but it came out as a whisper. Mira doesn't need to know about, about what I interrupted, about how her own mother has spent two and a/2 decades disrespecting her husband in a language she thought I couldn't understand, about how you've been planning to manipulate your inheritance to make sure I know my place behind them. I saw Mira walk into the kitchen doorway. From the look on her face, she'd heard at least the Last part, how long, she asked me quietly, since the engagement dinner.

He just sit in his chair by the window and wait for them to leave. My mom said he was lost without her. 54 years of marriage and now he didn't know what to do with himself. That's what it means to love someone. He just needs time to figure things out, to feel better without her, mom told me. Well, how long does that take? I asked nicely. She smiled and pulled me into a hug. Maybe weeks, maybe months, maybe even years. But he'll feel better eventually, she said. Years. But I wanted him to feel better right away. That's when I came up with an idea. That weekend, while my uncle took Grandpa out to grab groceries, I went to the house with my parents and aunt. They helped clean up the house and set up the dining table while I got to work in the kitchen. Pulled out Grandma's recipe box and found the card for her pot roast, Grandpa's favorite. I use the same cast iron pot she always used. I cut the vegetables the same way, even burn the onions a little the same way she did. Takes like this, add to the flavor, she'd always say. Her instructions, her laugh, everything was still fresh in my head. Grandma, if you're there, help Grandpa, smile, I whispered as I added the final touches.

His hands started to shake. His eyes scanned the clean living room, then landed on the dining table that was set with grandma's favorite ceramic plates, surrounded by his children and grandchildren. Grandpa, welcome home. Time to eat, the youngest cousin shouted. His lip trembled, but he still didn't speak. He just stood there, tears falling. My mom guided him to his chair at the head of the table. While I served everyone the way grandma used to. Mom pulled out her phone and took pictures of the pot roast with the whole family before we ate. Grandpa ate quietly, crying with bite. After dinner, he stepped into the kitchen to help me wash the dishes. We stood side by side at the sink, awkwardly silent. Then he started talking about how he fell in love with grandma because she was the kindest person he'd met, that he loved how she always had food waiting for him after 12 hour shifts at the factory, even when she was exhausted caring for five kids herself. Then he said something I never expected. I, I used to watch you and grandma cook together from the hallway. I always wished I could join, but I didn't wanna ruin it. She was the one with the cooking gift and you got It from her. I've never been more proud of having a gentle hearted grandson. I cried then. I mean, who wouldn't? I started coming over every weekend after that, taught him how to make all her recipes. And for three years we cooked together until he followed grandma to heaven, too.

They played football, got scholarships, made him beam proudly at every family gathering. While I couldn't throw a ball to save my life and my grades were average at best, the only thing I was ever good at was cooking, Grandpa made it clear that wasn't something to be proud of. He'd walk past the kitchen while I helped my grandma and mutter something under his breath. That's women's work, he told my dad once. Too girly for a growing boy. It hurt because I really loved it. I ended up just avoiding him and spending all my time in the kitchen with grandma, learning her recipes, watching her dance around the kitchen. I may have never really fit in with the family, but in that kitchen, she never made me feel like that at all. But when I turned 13, she passed suddenly and quickly, like a strike of lightning. One day she was laughing at my terrible knife skills and the next day she was gone, fell asleep and just never woke up. My family was devastated, but my grandpa seemed unfazed. He didn't cry at the funeral. He just went about his day like normal, working the field and garden, reading. The newspaper when people brought her up, he just shrug or walk.

Oil changes for both cars. My girlfriend's first and mine. I'm sitting in the waiting room with my car getting serviced, watching some YouTube video on my phone. Then it happened. This headache hit me. Not gradual, instant. Like someone shoved an ice pick behind my right eye and dragged it straight through to the back of my skull. I froze. The pain was unrelenting, but not unbearable. I'd never had a migraine before, so I figured that's what this was. People get migraines. Just push through it. When they finished, I texted my girlfriend. Got a bad headache, heading back to sleep it off. Got to her house, popped do ibuprofen and crashed. Woke up hours later with the sun setting. My head still felt like it was in a vice. I told myself I'd sleep it off overnight. Monday morning I woke up feeling terrible. Same pressure behind my eyes, same pain shooting through my skull. I work construction. Zero chance I could operate machinery feeling like this. Called in sick for the first time in months. My girlfriend came in around 10:00am. We should go to the ER. I just need more rest. It's probably a really bad migraine. You've been sleeping for 24 hours. Then I need 25. She didn't look convinced, but let it go. The only relief I found was cycling between painkillers and napping. Every time I woke up, the pain was still there. Tuesday morning, same symptoms. No improvement. My girlfriend walked in holding her car keys. We're going to the hospital. I'm not asking. Come on, I just need. You've had the same headache for three days. Get dressed. Basically dragged me to the car. Looking back, she saved my life. At the ER, I told the nurse my symptoms, then added, I also have a bad phobia of needles. I don't do IVs. They sent me for a CT scan without contrast because I refused the IV. I laid there thinking this was overkill for a headache. Back in the room, waiting for results, my girlfriend held my hand.

Been fighting since I was 16. Went pro at 22. My husband trains MMA at the same gym where I met him three years ago. His sparring partner, Cassidy, had been just friends for eight years. She made sure everyone knew it. First time we met, she hugged him for way too long. I'm talking a full 10 seconds while I stood there holding my gym bag. Then she turned to me, looked me up and down, and said, oh, you box, too? That's cute. Real condescending smile. I've been training since I was 12. I smiled back. I've been pro for six years. Her smile froze, but she recovered fast. Well, tech, it takes time to develop. You'll get there. My husband looked uncomfortable. I let it slide. Figured she was just protective of her training partner. I was wrong. Every single gym session after that, she'd find a reason to touch him, correcting his form by putting her hands on his waist. Her hips need to rotate more, she'd say, fingers lingering on his sides. My husband would step away. She'd follow. During water breaks, she'd stand between us, literally position her body so I couldn't join the conversation. If I walked up, she'd turn her back to me and start asking him technical questions. Remember that combination we worked on last month? Show me again. The messages started around week three. My husband showed me every single one because he knew how it looked. Can you look at my footwork video at eleven PM? Does this bruise look weird? With a close up photo of her inner thigh? I think I'm doing the hip tation wrong. Can you come early tomorrow and help me? He'd screenshot them and show me, frustrated. I don't know how to tell her to back off without being a jerk. We've trained together for almost a decade. I told him he needed to set boundaries. He tried. She'd act hurt and say things like, I'm just trying to improve. I thought we were teammates. Then came the supermarket incident. We were shopping for dinner when she appeared in the produce section. Oh my god, what are you doing here? She grabbed his arm, laughing at something. Didn't even look at me. Just started talking about some training video she'd seen. I watched for about 30 seconds and I walked to the snack aisle to cool off. When I came back five minutes later, she was still there, touching his bicep, now saying, you've gotten so much stronger. Have you been lifting heavier? My husband saw me and tried to step back. She moved closer. We should train tomorrow. Just us, like old times. I cleared my throat. She glanced at me like I was a stranger interrupting. Oh, you're Still here that night.

I've never heard my mother cry like that. Please call dad, I said, and hung up. Before I lost it. They tapped the IV. I didn't fight anymore. Did the CT scan.

Too much blood blocking the view. But I stabilized. Bleeding stopped by Friday. I left the hospital six weeks later. Second angiogram. This time they found it. An arteriovenous fistula. An artery incorrectly attached to a vein in my brain. Pumping high pressure blood into a low pressure system until the vein burst. I ignored a stroke for three days because I thought it was just a headache. Listen to your body

Sunday, April 2nd, 2,017. I remember the exact date because it's when my life split into before and after. Started normal quick workout that morning, then out to run errands, oil changes for both cars, my girlfriend's first and mine. I'm sitting in the waiting room with my car getting serviced, watching some YouTube video on my phone. Then happened. This headache hit me. Not gradual, instant, like someone shoved an ice pick behind my right eye and dragged it straight through to the back of my skull. I froze. The pain was unrelenting but not unbearable. I've never had a migraine before, so I figured that's what this was. People get migraines, just push through it. When they finished, I texted my girlfriend. Got a bad headache, heading back to sleep it off. Got to her house, popped 2 ibuprofen and crashed. Woke up hours later with the sun setting. My head still felt like it was in a vice. I told myself I'd sleep it off overnight. Monday morning I woke up feeling terrible. Same pressure behind my eye, same pain shooting through my skull. I work construction. Zero chance I could operate machinery feeling like this. Called in sick for the first time in months. My girlfriend came in around 10:00am. We should go to the er. I just need more rest. It's probably a really bad migraine. You've been sleeping for 24 hours then I need 25. She didn't look convinced but let it go. The only relief I found was cycling between painkillers and napping.

I just need. You've had the same headache for 3 days. Get dressed. Basically dragged me to the car. Looking back, she saved my life. At the E R, I told the nurse my symptoms, then added, I also have a bad phobia of needles. I don't do IVs. They sent me for a CT scan without contrast because I refused the IV. I laid there thinking this was overkill for a headache. Back in the room, waiting for results, my girlfriend held my hand. Neither of us said much. I saw my doctor jogging down the hallway. Doctors don't jog unless something's very wrong. He flew into the room out of breath. Hey, listen, man, you've had a stroke. Pretty major bleed in your brain right now. I need to.

So I'm making his life hell. My 16 year old stepson is the most entitled nightmare I've ever encountered. When I married his father three years ago, he called me a homewrecker day one, even though his mother cheated and caused the divorce. I tried everything. Went to his basketball games. He ignored me. Planned activities he bailed to smoke with friends. Meanwhile, he verbally abuses me, uses racial slurs. He calls jokes and orders me around like a servant. Get me McDonald's, he'll demand, then clap his hands. His father laughs, thinks it's hilarious. The physical stuff started small, slapping my butt, flicking my temple. His father calls it rebellious teenager behaviour. Last week at dinner, stepson mentioned getting in trouble for b s reasons, bullying a poor kid at school. I just make jokes about his clothes. Not my fault. He's broke and sensitive. His father backed schools are too sensitive. Kids need to toughen up. I snapped. Ironic when your kid is the most spoiled brat I've ever met. Stepson flipped his chair and stormed out. Husband and I fought all night. I was ready for divorce. Then the next day happened. I'm severely allergic to lavender. My skin breaks into painful hives that last weeks. I told them both multiple times. Got in the shower, used my body wash like always. Within minutes I was covered in burning, itching hives, full body allergic reaction. I Checked the bottle, no lavender listed. Checked online, no lavender in the ingredients. Walking past Stepson's open door, I saw it on his desk. Dried lavender left out in plain sight like a trophy. I emptied my shampoo bottle. At the bottom, more dry lavender. He deliberately poisoned me. Then displayed the evidence to taunt me. I took photos of everything. The lavender on his desk, the contaminated bottles, my hives which for spreading up my neck toward my face. Documented it all. But I didn't tell my husband. Not yet. See, I realized something. My husband would minimize this too, call it a prank, say I'm overreacting, maybe even blame me for not locking up my toiletries. So I started my revenge quietly. First, I replaced his expensive pre workout with salt. Watched him gag at the gym. Confused is why his 80 dollar supplement tasted like ocean water. Then I put hair removal cream in his styling gel. Just a little. Not enough to make him bald, just enough for mysterious thinning that's driving him insane. His PlayStation account got mysteriously banned after someone reported him for the racist messages. I screenshotted him sending 3 month ban. He's losing his mind. I've been slowly increasing the temperature on his phone charger with a modifier app. His phone overheats. Con.

She said Avery needed to learn to be more feminine, and this was a good opportunity. Jason told them no. He said it was our wedding and we'd already decided on the dress code.

I'm getting married next summer. When Jason proposed, I thought it would be nice to ask his niece Avery, to be a bridesmaid. She's 15 and the only kid on either side of our families. We'd only met twice before, but she seemed pretty cool and I figured it might help us get to know each other better. Fast forward to three weeks ago. We drove to Jason's hometown to visit his family and talk wedding stuff. His brother Greg, Greg's wife Monica and Avery came over to his parents house. Second I saw Avery, I noticed something different. She was wearing baggy cargo pants, an oversized hoodie, and her hair was pulled back in a messy bun, way more casual than the last time I'd seen her in a floral sundress. We sat in the living room drinking coffee and Jason's mom brought out wedding magazines. She started flipping through pages of bridesmaid dresses, pointing at the puffy ones and the sparky ones. Avery shifted in her seat. Her shoulders got tense. She stopped making eye contact with anyone. Monica noticed, oh, we'll have to take you shopping soon, honey. Get you something pretty and feminine. For once, she laughed like it was a joke. But Avery's face went red. Jason's mom chimed in, yes, and maybe we can do something with your hair. A nice updo would look so lovely. Greg nodded. It'll be good for you to dress up. You're at that age where you should be presenting yourself better. I watched Avery sink deeper into the couch. She pulled her hoodie sleeves over her hands. Then Monica said it. It'll be nice to see you dressed like a girl for once. My stomach dropped. I was a total tomboy growing up, hated dresses, hated makeup. My aunt used to say things.

I'm getting married next summer. When Jason proposed, I thought it would be nice to ask his niece Avery to be a bridesmaid. She's 15 and the only kid on either side of our families. We'd only met twice before, but she seemed pretty cool and I figured it might help us get to know each other better. Fast forward to three weeks ago. We drove to Jason's hometown to visit his family and talk wedding stuff. His brother Greg, Greg's wife Monica, and Avery came over to his parents house. Second I saw Avery, I noticed something different. She was wearing baggy cargo pants, an oversized hoodie, and her hair was pulled back in a messy bun. Way more casual than the last time I'd seen her in a floral sundress. We sat in the living room drinking coffee, and Jason's mom brought out wedding magazines. She started flipping through pages of bridesmaid dresses, pointing at the puffy ones and the sparkly ones. Avery shifted in her seat. Her shoulders got tense. She stopped making eye contact with anyone. Monica noticed. Oh, we'll have to take you shopping soon, honey. Get you something pretty and feminine for once. She laughed like it was a joke, but Avery's face went red. Jason's mom chimed in, yes, and maybe we can do something with your hair. A nice updo would look so lovely. Greg nodded. It'll be good for you to dress up. You're at that age where you should be presenting yourself better. I watched Avery sink deeper into the couch. She pulled her hoodie sleeves over her hands. Then Monica said, it'll be nice to see you dressed like a girl for once. My stomach dropped. I was a total tomboy growing up. Hated dresses, hated makeup. My aunt used to say things exactly like that to me at every family gathering, and it crushed me every single time.

Just started talking about some training video she'd seen. I watched for about 30 seconds, then I walked to the snack aisle to cool off. When I came back five minutes later, she was still there touching his bicep now saying, you've gotten so much stronger. Have you been lifting heavier? My husband saw me and tried to step back. She moved closer. We should train tomorrow, just us, like old times. I cleared my throat. She glanced at me like I was a stranger interrupting. Oh, you're still here. That night, I told my husband this had to stop. He agreed. He texted her, Cassidy, I need you to respect my relationship. The constant messages and physical contact need to end. She responded immediately, wow, I can't believe you throw away our friendship or some girl who doesn't even understand our training. He didn't reply. She showed up at the gym the next day acting like nothing happened. I decided I'd had enough. Next training session, I showed up in my gear, not the leggings and tank top I usually wore to watch my actual fight, shorts and hand wraps. Cassidy saw me and smirked. We're doing advanced drills today, lots of groundwork. You can sit this one out if you want. I started wrapping my hands. I'll join. She laughed. I don't want you to feel overwhelmed. This isn't a beginner class. I looked at my husband. He was trying not to smile. He Knew what was coming. Actually. I said I'd like to spar with Cassidy. The entire gym went quiet. Cassidy smiled a bit, but she recovered. Sure, but I don't want to hurt you. I've been doing this for 18 years. I stepped into the ring. You won't. She came at me, aggressive, trying to prove a point, throwing wild combinations, show boating for the gym. I slipped. Everything waited for my opening. Two minutes in, she was breathing hard, getting frustrated. She dropped her right hand for half a second. I threw a perfect left hook, caught her clean on the jaw. She went down like a puppet with hot strings out cold. Before she hit the canvas, the Jim erupted. My husband climbed through the ropes to check on her. She came to about 20 seconds later. Confused and embarrassed, I unwrapped my hands and left. Never went back to that gym. My husband quit the next week, found a new training spot. Cassidy texted him once. I can't believe you're choosing her over our friendship. He blocked her number. We got married six months later. Sometimes people don't respect boundaries until you enforce them.

It wasn't announced. That's what made it worse. I was in the library during study hall, 4th period, pretending to work on my history essay but really scrolling through my phone under the table. The library was always dead quiet except for the occasional cough or the sound of someone typing. Then the door opened and everyone looked up. Our principal, Doctor Ramirez, walked in with two police officers, not resource officers, real cops in full uniform with radios crackling static. They went straight to Missus Lynn's desk at the front. She was the head librarian who'd been there for like 20 years and never raised her voice at anyone. They started talking quietly, but the library was so silent you could hear their low murmurs echoing. I watched Missus Lynn's face change. First confusion, then concern, then this look I'd never seen on an adult before, pure horror. She put her hand over her mouth and just stare at them. One of the officers was holding a small notebook and kept glancing down at it while he talked. The other students were all watching now, too. Nobody even pretending to study anymore. Missus Lynn stood up so fast, her chair rolled backward and hit the wall. Her legs were visibly shaking. One of the officers reached out like he thought she might fall. She nodded at whatever they were saying and grabbed her desk to study. Herself. As they walked toward the hallway, they had to pass right by my table. I was in the second row, maybe six feet from them. That's when I heard Missus Lynn whisper, her voice cracking. Which classroom? The taller officer said quietly, room 2, 14, his third period class. My stomach fit Musically drop like that feeling when you miss a step going downstairs. Room 2, 14 was my math class, Mr Brian's classroom. I've been in there just two hours ago. Mr Brian had been teaching us about quadratic equations and making his usual dad jokes that nobody laughed at. He'd even written math rocks on the board with a little smiley face. My hands started sweat. I pulled out my phone under the table and texted my friend Aiden. Where were you today? Aiden had Mr Bryant third period too, same as me, but I hadn't seen him this morning. He wasn't in first period English either, which was weird because he never missed that class. We always sat together in the back corner. I stared at my phone.

I went home and pulled out every contract, every receipt, every vendor agreement from the past 18 months. Every single one was in my name. I called the venue coordinator and asked very specific questions. What happens if I revoke payment authorization on the day of the event? Do I need to be there in person? What documentation do I need? She answered every question, probably thinking I was just being thorough. Then I waited. The wedding day arrived sunny and perfect. I pulled into the parking lot one hour before the ceremony, but I wasn't wearing my mother of the groom outfit because I wasn't there as a guest. I found the venue coordinator and handed her a notarized letter revoking all payment authorization effective immediately. And she read it twice before asking if I was sure. I told her I was certain. She made a phone call, then another. The catering manager disappeared into the kitchen. The photographer stopped setting up her equipment. The florist stepped back from the centerpieces. The string quartet went quiet. One by one, every vendor I had hired stopped working and started packing up. Angela came rushing out in her dress, demanding to know why everyone stopped. And someone pointed at me. Her face cycled through confusion, recognition and fury as she stormed over screaming, what the hell do you think you're doing? I told her calmly, That I was revoking my payment. Daniel appeared half dressed, asking what was going on. While guests twisted in their seats to watch. Angela screamed that I was crazy, vindictive, that I couldn't do this to her. She turned on Daniel, shrieking at him to fix this, to make his mother stop, to be a man for once in your pathetic life. I looked at my son and told him I was sorry, that I would have given him anything to be part of his life, but I was done being mocked by someone who spent my money while calling me pathetic behind my back. Angela completely lost control, then screaming in front of every guest, her family, her bridesmaids. You were never going to be part of this family. You're a sad, lonely old woman. And the only way anyone would tolerate you is if you paid them to silence. Every single person heard exactly who she was. Daniel stared at his bride like he was seeing her for the first time. I didn't respond to Angela's outburst. I looked at my son one more time, watching him stand frozen between his screaming fiance and the mother. He let her tear apart and then I turned and walked out. After I'd driven three blocks away, my phone buzzed with a text from Daniel. Mom, I'm so sorry. Can we talk? I looked at it for a long moment, then put the phone down and kept driving.

They closed the high limit salon just for me. One table, one wheel. One nurse from Toulouse who'd lost her mind. About 40 strangers gathered to watch. They could smell that something insane was about to happen. Security stood at every corner. Cameras pointed at me from every angle. I converted everything to chips. The pile looked impossible. $8.1 million in colored plastic. I pushed them all to the center of the table, all in on black. The dealer was an older woman with kind eyes. She asked if I would share. I said yes. She asked again. I said yes. She asked a third time, voice softer now, like she was giving me one last chance to walk away with my miracle intact. I thought about my son asleep in his hospital bed. I thought about the gofundme that never hit its goal. I thought about every night I'd fallen asleep in a plastic chair, praying for something to change. Change. I said yes. The wheel spun. The sound disappeared. I couldn't hear the crowd, couldn't hear the casino. Couldn't hear anything except my own heartbeat. Counting the seconds. The ball danced around the wheel, bouncing between numbers like it was deciding my son's future. It kissed Red 16. My stomach dropped. It kissed Red 23. I stopped breathing. It teetered on the edge of Red 5. Someone behind me whispered, oh, my god. Then it dropped Black 2. The room exploded. Strangers screamed like I Was family. A woman I'd never met grabbed me and sobbed into my shoulder. I couldn't move. My legs stopped working. Security had to help me to the cage because I was shaking too hard to walk. $16.2 million. I sat on the carpet outside the cashier's window and cried until I couldn't breathe. A security guard brought me tissues and said, you just became a legend, ma'am. I walked into a gas station with eleven dollars and walked out with 13 million. I drove to Vegas and doubled it somewhere between the Circle K and the Bellagio. I became the luckiest woman alive. Or the craziest. Probably both. Tonight I'm going to sit next to my son's hospital bed and hold his hand while he sleeps. When he wakes up, I'm going to tell him the same thing I whispered when that ball landed on black. We're going to be okay, baby. We're finally going to be okay.

I proved her right by closing it. When my son Daniel got engaged to Angela, I made myself a promise that I would be the mother in law I never had. I would be warm and welcoming and generous and I would make sure she felt like part of our family. From day one, when they started planning the wedding, I said yes to everything, the venue, the catering, the photographer, the flowers, the honeymoon in Santorini, $47,000 over 18 months, because I wanted Angela to know she was loved. Then three weeks before the wedding, I went to a dress fitting with her and saw something I was never supposed to see. Angela left her phone unlocked on a chair. And when I came back to grab my purse, I saw my name in a group chat with her bridesmaids. Hundreds of messages calling me desperate and pathetic and a sad old woman trying to buy her way into relevance. She was bragging about convincing me to upgrade the venue while her friends laughed about how Daniel was finally seeing who his mother really is. I stood there reading with my hands shaking and when I heard her coming, I set the phone down and smiled like nothing was wrong. I didn't confront anyone because I wanted to see how far they would go. And the answer was further than I could have imagined. The very Next week, Angela forgot to include me on the email chain for the bridal shower I paid for. I only found out it happened when I saw photos on her Instagram. She told me the dress I picked for the wedding was a little much and suggested I find something more appropriate for my age. At a family dinner, I excused myself to use the bathroom and heard her in the kitchen telling Dan, you know that I was obsessed with control and my son didn't defend me. He just sighed and said, I know, I'm working on it. Over the next two weeks, he started repeating her phrases back to me. You have to respect our boundaries. This is our life, not yours. Maybe you should focus on your own happiness. Every conversation felt like talking to Angela through a Daniel shaped puppet. Then came the rehearsal dinner, the one I paid for. And Angela cornered me outside the venue near the parking lot. She had a smile on her face like we were about to share a secret. You know you're not actually going to be part of this family, right, she said, her voice sweet as honey. You're just a wallet with legs. She laughed like it was the funniest joke she'd ever told. I looked at her and said very calmly, I want you to remember you said that to me. She rolled her eyes.

Twenty four hours later, I was at a Vegas roulette table with $8 1 million all in on black. I'm a night shift nurse in Tucson. Single mom. My son is 7 years old and has leukemia. The medical debt was already at $87,000 and climbing. Every experimental treatment cost more than my yearly salary. I've been living on coffee and prayer for two years, watching other moms in the hospital. Facebook groups lose their homes, trying to keep their kids alive. That morning, I stopped at the same Circle K I've used for eight years. Bought a Diet Coke and two scratch offs. It was almost everything I had. The first one looked like it won $20. I laughed and tossed it in my cup holder. The second ticket? Flash numbers I didn't understand. I stared at it for so long, the clerk came around the counter to check on me. $13 million. The manager verified it three times. Then he told me to look at the first ticket again, the one I'd tossed. I'd misread it in my excitement. That one wasn't $20. It was 500,000. 13.5 million total. I stood there in my purple scrubs, still smelling like hospital bleach, holding two pieces of paper worth more than I could comprehend after taxes. Eight one million hit my account. My phone exploded. Cousins I hadn't spoken to in 15 years, news vans in my parking lot, my ex suddenly remembering our son's Name? I turned it all off because the only thing I could think about was the mom from Ohio in my Facebook group. She won a settlement for 800,000 after her husband died. She thought it would cover everything. Her daughter's cancer came back twice. The money was gone in 14 months. She lost her house anyway. 13 million sounds like forever. It's not. Not with childhood cancer, not with experiment. So trials that cost 50,000 a dose. Not when the disease can come back anytime it wants. I needed the money to be untouchable. I needed a miracle on top of a miracle. So I did the insane thing. I drove to Vegas alone. Didn't tell anyone. Four hours in the dark, crying the whole way. Radio playing songs I couldn't hear over my own heartbeat. I walked into the Bellagio at 1:12 in the morning, still wearing my purple scrubs because I hadn't packed anything. I showed the Pit Boss my wire transfer confirmation, printed at a copy shop off the strip.

I know I wasn't there when you were growing up. I know you raised them. I've always known and I let them believe otherwise because it was easier than admitting what I did to you. I said what you did was steal my childhood and then let them blame me for surviving it. Every single one of my siblings has apologized. I've accepted some of them and I'm still thinking about the others. I will never be the family caretaker. Again.

My brother Donovan looked at me and said, you could at least pretend to appreciate our mother for once. I looked around the table at my four siblings and wondered if any of them actually remembered our childhood. I was 11 years old when I became a mother to four children. My father left, and my mother checked out completely. She'd stay in her bedroom for days at a time, and I'd slide food under her door, hoping she'd eat. I Learned to forge her signature in sixth grade because she wouldn't get out of bed to sign permission slips. I worked at a grocery store at 15 and lied about my age so I could buy food when her disability checks ran. Now I got a full scholarship to a college three hours away and turned it down because I couldn't leave my siblings alone with her. I missed my own prom because my youngest brother had pneumonia and no one else was going to take him to the emergency room. I raised four children before I turned 18, and none of them remember. They remember mom being sad. They remember mom being tired. They don't remember that I was the one who made sure they ate and bathed and Got to school and had clean. They don't remember me staying up until two in the morning helping with homework while mom slept in the next room. They don't remember me walking three miles to the pharmacy when Vera had an ear infection because mom wouldn't get out of bed and we didn't have a car. Now we're all adults, and I'm still doing it. I coordinate every holiday and every birthday. I babysit all nine of their kids on a rotating schedule that I manage. I covered Donovan's mortgage.

He stepped right up to Connor and said loud enough for everyone to hear. You touch him again. Make one more mess for him to clean up or say one more word about my family and I'll show you what I Learned in Afghanistan. Turns out the guy wasn't even a student. He was a Marine who just gotten back from deployment and was visiting his grandfather while figuring out his next move. The shadowing thing was just cover so he could spend time at the school during the day. Coach Williams separated them, but words spread fast. By the end of the day, everyone knew Connor had been torturing a war veteran's grandfather. The principal called Connor's parents for a meeting. Connor got suspended for a week. His parents tried to fight it, threatening to pull their donations. But too many people had heard what happened. The worst part for Connor was when his college recruiter found out. They pulled his scholarship offer. Apparently, they don't want players who pick on elderly immigrants.

I drove to her apartment with two pints of ice cream. We talked until 4:00am. About the people we lost. The futures that died with him. The guilt of wanting to be happy again. We started dating a year ago. Slow. Careful. I told the girls. After three months, Lily asked if Rachel was replacing Mama. I said, no one could ever replace Mama. But Rachel makes daddy feel less sad. Mia hugged Rachel and said, Mama would want daddy to be happy. Happy? Rachel's been amazing with him. She reads the same bedtime stories Sarah used to. Does the voices exactly right. She Learned to make Sarah's famous chocolate chip pancakes from a recipe card she found. She never tries to be their mom.

It's my day to fall apart without the girls seeing. But this year, Mia came into my room at 7 a m. Dad, can Rachel come with us today? I think. I think mom would want to meet her. My throat closed up. You sure, honey? Yeah. Rachel's part of our family now. Mama should know. We drove to the cemetery. At 10 a m. The girls picked wildflowers from the field outside.

Why didn't you just tell me? Because you wouldn't have let me. She went quiet. That therapist said touch helps. You wouldn't ask for it, so I made you need it. I'm sorry if that's manipulative, but I couldn't watch you suffer anymore. She stared at the utility Bill, $340. You've been paying an extra $200 a month just so I'd unconsciously grab onto you in my sleep. Worth every penny. That's when she started crying. Not sad, crying. Something else. I knew something was different. I'd wake up and the pain would be manageable for once. Thought maybe the medication was finally working or my body was healing. She wiped her eyes. It was you the whole time. It was you. She stood up, walked over to the thermostat and changed it to 60. Yeah, you don't have to trick me anymore. Then she grabbed my hand and pulled me toward the bedroom. Just ask. That was a week ago. Now, every night before bed, she has this little routine. She'll be brushing her teeth and she'll look at me through the bathroom mirror and say, cold tonight? And I always answer, yes. The electric bills back down to normal. But she still Curls up against me, exactly the same way she did when I was secretly running the AC. Turns out she didn't need the cold. She just needed to know I wanted her close.

She doesn't know started doing this about 4 months ago, right after her surgery. She had a tumor removed from her spine, benign, thank god. But the recovery was absolutely brutal. Three months of physical therapy twice a week at first, then bumped up to 4 times when she wasn't progressing fast enough. The nerve damage meant she couldn't sleep on her back anymore, had to be on her side. And even then, she'd wake up every two hours from the pain shooting down her left leg. The doctors prescribed everything, muscle relaxers, nerve blockers, even tried acupuncture. Nothing worked. And during one of her PT sessions, this older therapist mentioned something about touch therapy, how consistent physical contact can help retrain damaged nerves, reduce inflammation, give the brain something else to focus on besides pain signals. I asked if she wanted me to try it. She said no. My wife's the type who hates asking for help, hates feeling like a burden. She'd rather suffer alone than admit she needs something. So I got creative. Week one, I started small. Set the thermostat to 68 at night instead of our usual 72. She snuggled closer, but nothing dramatic. Week two, I dropped it to 66. She'd roll over in her sleep and press her back against my chest.

I have this terrible habit of doing everything last minute. And I mean everything. Homework done during lunch, project night before, studying for tests. What's studying? I just walk in, pray, and somehow scrape by with a C plus. My parents hated it. Teachers would literally beg me to just try for once, but honestly, it kept working. So why change? Then 8th grade hits, and they announce the big one. This massive final exam that decides if you even move on to high school. Like, fail this, you're repeating the entire year. Hello? Everyone in my grade was panicking. Kids were making study schedules three weeks out, forming study groups, buying practice book. My friend Terrell, dude made flashcards. Physical flashcard in 2024. I'm talking color coded, laminated, organized by subject. Like he was preparing for the SATs. Meanwhile, I'm over here telling myself, yeah, I'll study. I got time. Week before the exam, I discovered this new show. Binge the entire thing in three days. Two days before, my cousin wanted to play basketball all afternoon. Did I say no? Absolutely not. We were out there for hours. I came home sweaty, exhausted, and still haven't cracked open a single notebook. The night before, I'm sitting at my desk, notes stacked up, textbooks open, highlighters ready. I'm ready to lock in. Then I remembered I was stuck on this one level in my game. Just one level. I told Myself. One level turned into 12. Suddenly it's 2:00am, I'm half asleep, and I've looked at exactly zero pages of notes. I went to bed thinking, well, it's been a good run. Next morning, I dragged myself to school, running on four hours of sleep. And vibe. Literally just vibes. No breakfast, no confidence, no clue. I walk into that classroom, and everyone's doing last minute cramming. Terrell's flipping through his flashcards like his life depends on it. Another kids rocking back and forth, mumbling formulas. One girl looked like she was about to cry. Test start. I open the booklet. First question, no idea. Second question, also no idea. I'm reading these questions like I've never seen the English language before. Math section, straight guessing. Science. Picking answers that sounded right. Reading comprehension. I'm out here choosing based on what I would have done in that situation. If the character seemed chill, I picked C. If they seemed stressed, I went with B. That was my system. 30 minutes in, I'm done. Not because I finished carefully, because there's no point staring at questions I don't know. I turned it in, and my teacher just looked at me disappointed. Headshake that says I'm not even surprised. I went home fully prepared to tell my parents I'm staying in middle school another year, already planning my excuse, my apology speech, the whole thing. Two weeks later, grades drop online. I'm sitting there on my phone, terrified to even look. Heart Pounding palm sweaty, I slowly scrolled to my name, closed my eyes, opened them, saw 84% and 84. I passed. Not only passed, but got a whole B. I just sat there staring at my screen like it was lying to me. The reliable last minute method worked once again.

And in the middle of court, her own daughter stood up and said, this is why I don't have any friends. My daughter came home from a birthday party glowing. She was 9 years old and wouldn't stop talking. Mom, this girl's so cool. I can't believe we never talked before. The birthday girl was a quiet kid at school, didn't have any friends. I don't understand why nobody wants to be friends with her. She's literally the coolest person ever. My daughter was bouncing around the kitchen. We're best friends now. Can she come over? Can we have a sleepover? I smiled. It was sweet. My daughter had made a real connection. Two weeks later, I got a letter in the mail, certified official looking. I opened it. It was a lawsuit for $350 plus $200 for emotional distress from the birthday girl's mother. I stared at the paper, reading it three times. There was an itemized list. Couch usage, $12. Defendant's daughter sat on the living room couch for 2.5 hours causing premature wear. Beverage consumption, $8. Two juice boxes. Food consumption, $15. Snack consumption, $10. Bathroom facilities, $18. Including $2 for toilet paper, estimated 24 sheets. My hands were shaking from disbelief. Then the letter changed tone. Additionally, your daughter used items belong to my daughter and my daughter demands compensation. I felt my chest tighten. Tea set usage, $20. Dollhouse furniture, $30. Personal tissue box usage, $15. The letter ended, my daughter feels violated and demands compensation. Pay within 10 days or see you in court. I sat down, read it again. My daughter came into the kitchen. What's wrong? I showed her the letter, kept it simple. The birthday girl's mom is upset that you went to the party. Her face fell. What? Why? I don't know, sweetie. The next day at school, my daughter tried to talk to the girl, but the girl wouldn't even look at her, just walked away. My daughter came home confused. I guess I understand now. She looked down. Why? She doesn't have friends. I sent one response to the letter, see you in court. 6 weeks later, the court date arrived, small claims court. The judge looked bored. The woman stood up. She had bags, multiple bags. She started pulling things out. She brought the couch cushions, leftover birthday cake in a Tupperware container, empty juice boxes. Your honor, as you can see, this child caused significant damage to my home. She.

At home, she calls the refrigerator the cold box and thinks escalators are moving stairs. We just smile and move on. But at Grandpa's funeral, she'd been on her best behavior for two hours, sitting quietly in her black dress with the white collar, swinging her legs, whispering questions about why everyone looks so sad. Sad. Then the honor guard arrived. Seven soldiers in full dress uniform. Crisp, silent. Their boots made this synchronized SoundOn the chapel floor that made everyone sit up straighter. They were carrying his flag, folded into that perfect triangle. The whole room went completely still. Lily tugged my sleeve hard. Auntie, he whispered, but it was that kid whisper that everyone within 10 feet can hear. Are those the people Grandpa grounded? I froze. My sister's face went white. My mom closed her eyes. The veterans in the row ahead of us turned around. This old guy, had to be at least 75, with medals covering half his chest, just stared at Lily. His face was doing this thing where you could tell he was trying so hard not to react. Sweetie, I whispered back, what do you mean, grounded? She pointed directly at the honor guard. You said grandpa trained people in the army. Like when I'm bad and you ground me. No TV, no iPad. Just thinking about what I did. The old veteran's shoulders started shaking. His wife grabbed his arm, but it was too late. He completely lost it. Started crying, laughing so hard he had to cover his mouth with both hands. His whole body was shaking. Then the guy next to him caught it. Then the woman next to him. Within 30 seconds, the entire row of veterans was struggling not to laugh. At a military funeral. My sister was trying to shush Lily, her face bright red, but the laughter was spreading. It wasn't disrespectful laughter. It was this wave of something that felt like relief. Like Lily had accidentally said the one thing everyone needed to hear. The honor guard stayed stone faced, professional. But I swear I saw the guy on the left, the one closest to us, his jaw twitch. The corner of his mouth moved maybe a millimeter. They completed the flag ceremony perfectly presented it

Now, your grandpa did train us, sweetheart, he said. And yeah, he grounded us plenty when we messed up. Lily's eyes went wide. Really?

He pointed at a figure standing over the guy in the photo. See him? That's your grandpa. And yeah, I was very, very grounded that day. Lily studied the photo seriously, then looked up at him. Did you learn your lesson? I did. Never fell asleep on duty again. Good, Lily said, nodding like a tiny judge. Another veteran stepped forward. He grounded me for a week. Once made me clean every single rifle in the armory because I showed up late to formation. Then another, he grounded me by making me memorize the entire military Code of conduct, 200 pages. Then another. He grounded our whole unit once we had to run 15 miles in full gear because somebody left trash on the training field. They kept coming, one after another, sharing their stories. Every single one of them smile, milling through tears. Lily stood there taking it all in, clearly proud that she'd been right about the grounding thing. The old guy stood back up, looked at my sister, and his voice changed, got quieter, more serious. Your father was the toughest drill instructor I ever had. Scared the hell out of all of us. He paused, but he's also the reason I'm alive. We all are, every person here. He trained us so hard because he wanted us to come home. He turned back toward the casket, stood at attention and gave a slow, perfect salute. Then he looked down at Lily one more time. You tell people your grandpa grounded soldiers. That's exactly what he did. And we loved him for it. Lily held on to that story for years.

Whenever someone new asks about siblings, I just say I'm a triplet with two brothers, present tense. I'm not trying to trauma dump. During small talk people I barely know. From talking to others in grief support groups, I Learned this is pretty common. You give the simple answer. And I started working at a new job three months ago. The co workers are nice enough, but I still feel like the outsider. They're all really close, been working together for years. When they asked how many siblings I have during lunch one day, I gave them my usual answer. No problems there. Everyone just nodded and the conversation moved on to other topics. In one week, my car broke down and was in the shop. So my other triplet brother picked me up every day after work. My coworker Kate saw him pull up on the third day. She practically ran over to my desk. The next morning, she thought he was cute, like really cute. She asked me to set them up, batting her eyelashes like we were suddenly best friends. I politely said, no, he has A girlfriend. They've been together for two years. She looked disappointed, but then her face lit. She asked about my other brother. Maybe he's single. I hesitated for a second, then just said he isn't available either. Technically true, just not in the way she was thinking. He's been dead for 9 years. So yeah, definitely not available. I didn't want to explain the whole tragic backstory to someone I'd known for 3 months. So I left it at she seemed annoyed but dropped it or so I thought. A few weeks past by normally. Then one day I'm in the break room making coffee when I overhear Kate trash talking me to some of the younger co workers. She's going on about how I'm stuck up and fake. She tells them she knows I lied about my other brother being unavailable because she found him on Instagram and he's completely, she's showing them his profile on her phone talking about how shady I am for lying to her face. I'm standing there confused because my deceased brother never had an Instagram. He died before Instagram was even popular. I don't say anything. I just leave the break room and go back to my desk. But I'm trying to piece this together in my head. Then it hits me. She probably stalked my Instagram, saw photos with my male cousin who shares our last name and and he was the third triplet. He's in a bunch of family photos with Me and my brother, he's around our age, looks vaguely like us. She literally just picked a random guy from my photos and decided that was my brother. I wanted to ignore it because I absolutely hate confrontation. But the next day.

The corner of his mouth moved maybe a millimeter. They completed the flag ceremony perfectly, presented it to my grandmother. She held it against her chest and smiled through her tears. And I heard her whisper, he would have loved that. After the service, we were standing by the casket when veterans started approaching us. Not just one or two, at least 15 different people all waiting patiently to meet Lily. The old guy who laughed first got down on one knee in front of her. His wife was still with him, smiling. Now, your grandpa did train us, sweetheart, he said. And yeah, he grounded us plenty when we messed up. Lily's eyes went wide. Really? He pulled out his phone and scrolled to a photo, black and white from the 70s maybe, showed it to Lily. That's me doing push UPS in the MUD at 3 in the morning, 200 of them, as your grandpa caught me sleeping on watch when I was supposed to be guarding the base. He pointed at a figure standing over the guy in the photo. See him? That's your grandpa. And yeah, I was very, very grounded that day. Lily studied the photo seriously, then looked up at him. Did you learn your lesson? I did. Never fell asleep on duty again. Good, Lily said, nodding like a tiny judge. Another veteran stepped forward. He grounded Me for a week. Once made me clean every single rifle in the armory because I showed up late to formation. Then another, he grounded me by making me memorize the entire military code of conduct, 200 pages. Then another, he grounded our whole unit. Once we had to run 15 miles in full gear because somebody left trash on the training field. They kept coming, one after another, sharing their stories, every single one of them smiling tears. Lily stood there taking it all in, clearly proud that she'd been right about the grounding thing. The old guy stood back up, looked at my sister, and his voice changed, got quieter, more serious. Your father was the toughest drill instructor I ever had. Scared the hell out of all of us. He paused, but he's also the reason I'm alive. We all are, every person here. He trained us so hard because he wanted us to come home. He turned back toward the casket, stood at attention and gave a slow, perfect salute. Then he looked down at Lily one more time. You tell people your grandpa grounded soldiers. That's exactly what he did. And we loved him for it. Lily held on to that story for years.

That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about how eager my mom had been for me to choose, how she kept pushing Friday as the deadline, how Marcus had already moved boxes into her car. I started going through old emails on the family computer. My mom had been researching single car accidents, break line failures and something called widows benefits for the past six months. Thursday morning, I went to my dad's office and told him everything I'd found. He didn't believe me at first, but then I showed him the search history, the messages I'd screenshotted. We went to the police. They said they couldn't do anything based on internet searches and text messages. Lots of people research morbid things. Doesn't mean they're planning murder. But my dad was scared. He stayed at a hotel Thursday night instead of going home. I stayed with my best friend, Sarah. At 2 a. M, my phone rang. It was my mom. Where's your father? Her voice was shaking. He was supposed to be home hours ago. He's safe, I said. Away from you. The line went silent. Then she said something that made my blood freeze. You don't understand what you've done. Marcus needed that money. We're in debt to some very dangerous people. She hung up. Friday morning, my dad and I went back to the police with the recording of that call. This time they listened. They told us to stay. Away from the house while they investigated. Six hours later, they called. They'd found Marcus at our house with bags of my dad's clothes, staged a car in the garage. The car was running. He'd been planning to make it look like my dad had taken his own life. My mom was arrested as an accessory. Turns out Marcus had a gambling problem and owed over $300,000 to loan sharks. The life insurance policy was for $500,000. They'd plan the whole divorce as a cover story. I'm 18 now, living with my dad in a new city. My mom took a plea deal and got seven years. Marcus got 15. The house sold last month. My dad split the money with me for college. I haven't spoken to my mom since the trial. She sends letters sometimes, but I don't open them.

I froze mid scoop. What are you talking about? She didn't even look up from her phone. Your dad and I are getting divorced. We're selling the house. You have until Friday to decide who you want to live with. I was 17. They've been fighting for months, but I didn't think it was this bad. That night, I tried talking to my dad. He was in the garage packing boxes. Dad, what's going on? He finally stopped and looked at me. Your mom and I agreed. You're old enough to choose. No pressure. But there was pressure. My mom kept making comments about how Dad's new apartment was smaller. My dad mentioned Mom's boyfriend was moving in next month. Wait, boyfriend? Yeah, dad said, not meeting my eyes. Marcus. They met at her office. I felt sick. How long does it matter? He went back to packing. Next day, I confronted my mom. She was in her bedroom sorting through old photos and I noticed she was only keeping the ones without my dad in them. Marcus and I have been together for 4 months, she admitted. But your father knew we were already separated emotionally. Four months. The house went up for sale six months ago. Her face changed. Your father told you that? That's when I found the real estate listing on her laptop. She listed The house eight months ago before the fights even started. I went back to my dad that night. When did you actually find out about Marcus? He was silent for a long time. Then he pulled out his phone and showed me a text. Red. My mom had been planning to leave for over a year. The messages went back to when I was 16. But it got worse. There was a message from my mom to Marcus that, just need to wait until the life insurance policy matures in November. Then we can be together. My blood went cold. Dad, what life insurance policy? His face went pale. I took one out three years ago. Your mom's the beneficiary. It matures next week. Friday, I whispered. The same day they wanted me to choose the same.

I drove six hours straight and found her starving in a storage closet. In high school, I sold vapes to freshmen and thought fear meant respect. Then I got this girl I was seeing pregnant, spent about four months playing house before I came home drunk one night and she went off saying, you're a loser who will never be a good dad. We'd be better off with you dead. So I drove her to her mom's house and left town. I've been sending her about 500 to 1,000 dollars every month for our daughter working construction 12 hours away. My mom lives near them and was the one who suggested I just live my own life. She checks in on them for me, handles the money, even has my daughter Facetime me once a month. My daughter is always smiling and my mom keeps saying everything's great, so I believe it. At 2:00am, my phone rings. My daughter's voice is on the other end, tiny and terrified. Mommy's gone and I'm hungry and I don't know what to do. I'm already grabbing keys as I tell her, baby, I'm coming right now. Where's Mommy? The line goes dead. I call back voicemail, call my ex voicemail, call my mom voicemail. I'm doing 90 on the highway and nobody's answering. Six hours later, I burst through my ex's unlocked door and the smell hits me. First, rotting food mixed with chemicals. Find my daughter in a glorified storage closet on a bare mattress with springs poking through, covered in dried filth, her face so thin I can see her skull. You came, she whispered. I scoop her up and she weighs like nothing, like holding bones wrapped in skin. I carry her to the bathroom, but there's black mold in the tub and no clean towels, so I use my shirt and bottled water from my truck. Then I see the padlocked bedroom door. I kick it open. Inside is a red room with cameras on tripods, ring lights and piles of costumes. My ex told me she was making YouTube movie reactions, not doing cam work, all while my daughter starves in the next room. I scoop up my daughter and drive to the nearest hospital. Her little body limp in my arms. The er doctor hooks her to IV.

So we're at this restaurant for my mother in law's birthday lunch, normal day, right? Everyone's looking at menus. Kids are being loud. You know how it goes. Then my sister in law Jessica stands up and announces to the entire table that all the kids will be having chicken tenders and fries from the kids menu with apple juice. She didn't ask anyone, just decided for everyone's children. Now, here's the thing. My son Owen is 9 and my daughter Chloe is 4. They don't eat like toddlers anymore. Owen plays soccer three times a week and eats more than I do sometimes. Two chicken tenders and like 10 fries, that's a snack for him, not lunch. And Chloe has been eating regular food since she was two because she refused baby food and always wanted whatever we were eating. The waiter gets to our side of the table and I can see Jessica staring at me, probably expecting me to just go along with her announcement. But I'm not about to pay 15 bucks to watch my kids be hungry for the rest of the day. I tell the waiter that my kids will be ordering from the regular menu. Owen orders a burger with sweet potato fries and Chloe gets the Mac and cheese with broccoli on the side. Jessica's face goes red immediately, like bright red. She leans over and whispers really loudly that I'm being difficult. I just smiled and said I'm paying for my own kids meals so it shouldn't matter to her. Her kids are 6 and 3 and they're fine with tenders, but mine aren't. The lunch continues and honestly, I thought it was done. My kids ate their food, were full and happy and we sang Happy Birthday to my mother in law. Everything seemed fine until we got to the parking lot. Jessica corners me by my car and goes off. She says I embarrassed her in front of everyone and made her look like a bad mom because now her kids were asking why they couldn't order what they wanted. She told them they were all getting the same thing and I ruined it. I told her that's not my problem and she shouldn't have made decisions for my children without asking me first. She literally called me selfish and said I always have to make everything about me and my perfect kids, which is insane because all I did was order them food they'd actually eat. Then she said if I can't follow simple family decisions, maybe I shouldn't come to family events anymore. My husband was standing there the whole time and didn't say anything until we got in the car. Then he admitted Jessica does this controlling thing a lot, but usually people just go along with it. To keep the peace, he said, maybe I should have just let it go this one time. But why? Why should my kids be hungry? Because Jessica wants everyone to do exactly what she says.

Early, late, middle of the night after picking up extra hours every single time. If she knew I was coming, the door would be locked. If she didn't know it was open and she was just hanging out doing normal stuff, I asked her one more time to stop locking me out of my own bedroom.

By 10:00am, my principal was being escorted out of the building by security. By noon, I had an educational assistant assigned to my classroom. By the end of the week, my schedule was completely redone. With proper planning time.

I have this two bedroom apartment downtown that I rent, and honestly, I love it. My brother Austin has crashed in my guest room probably 20 times over the past few years. He respects my space, always cleans up after himself, never makes a mess. So when he texted me asking if he and his new girlfriend could stay the weekend while they visited the city, I said sure without even thinking about it. The girlfriend's name was Tori. I hadn't met her yet, but Austin seemed really into her, so I figured she'd be cool. Friday night rolls around and they show up at my door around six. Tori walks in and immediately starts looking around my apartment like she's inspecting it. She opens my coat closet, peeks into my bathroom, even checks out my kitchen cabinets. I thought maybe she was just being curious, but it felt weird. Austin suggested we go grab dinner at this Italian place down the street. Nothing fancy, but they have really good pasta and the bread is amazing. We get seated and everything seems fine at first. We're looking at menus, and Tori asks what I do for work. I tell her I'm a graphic designer, and she nods but doesn't really say anything back. Our waiter brings bread to the table, and Tori just starts talking. She goes, so you rent this apartment? Right? I'm like, yeah, been there for three years. And she literally laughs and says, oh, so you're one of those people who just throws money away every month? I genuinely thought she was joking, so I laughed a little, but she keeps going. She says renting is basically the most financially irresponsible thing a person can do, and that people who rent are the reason they'll never build any real wealth. Try to explain that I like the flexibility, since my job might relocate me in the next couple years, and I don't want to be stuck with a mortgage. She just rolls her eyes. Then she says, well, maybe if you didn't waste so much money eating out at restaurants, you could actually afford a down payment on a house. Austin's face goes completely red, and he tells her to drop it, but Tori won't stop. She starts going off about how people like me are part of the reason the economy is messed up, because we don't prioritize homeownership and we just live these irresponsible lifestyles. At this point, I'm done being polite. I tell her straight up that she's being rude and condescending and that my financial choices are none of her business. She looks shocked, like she can't believe I'm calling her out. The waiter brings our food, and we eat in complete silence. Austin tries to make small talk, but it's so awkward that he gives up after like two minutes. We finish eating And head back to my apartment. As soon as we walk in, I pull Austin aside into my bedroom and tell him I don't feel comfortable having Tori stay in my home anymore. He tries to apologize for her and says she didn't mean it the way it came out, but I'm not budging. I tell him he's welcome to stay, but Tori needs to find somewhere else to sleep.

That night, there was a section about classroom size. Any class over 30 students is required to have an educational assistant. I had 46. After a month and a half of barely surviving, I brought this up to my principal. She denied my request immediately. There's no money in the budget. Make it work or leave. I was stubborn. I thought I could handle it. To do the bare minimum of my job, I was at school from 6:00am to nine PM every weekday. Then I spent my entire week and planning lessons and grading. I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating right. I was drowning. When my first evaluation came, I expected to be torn apart. Instead, my principal gave me all satisfactory marks. I was confused, but relieved. I didn't realize she was setting me up. A few more weeks passed and I couldn't take it anymore. I contacted the union and explain and everything. The class sizes, the impossible schedule, the lack of support. They said they'd handle it. Nothing changed. By Thanksgiving, I was completely burnt out. But I had two days off for the break, so I went to a potluck dinner with some old college friends to try and decompress. I started talking to this guy I barely knew and his husband about my new job. I mentioned how amazing my students were, how creative and smart, but how frustrated I was that I couldn't give them the attention they deserved. With 46 kids in the room at once. Husband raised an eyebrow. What school do you work at? I told him I didn't think twice about it. That Monday morning at 805:00am, my principal came storming into my classroom. Her face was right red. Her hands were shaking. She slammed the door so hard, the windows rattled. You talk to someone about this school, about me? I'm going to have you fired. I'm going to make sure you never work in education again. You're done. I just stare. Stared at her, completely frozen. Then my phone buzzed. It was an email from the district office asking me to come in during my lunch break. Turns out the guy I talked to at Thanksgiving wasn't just some random person. He was a district superintendent. He'd filed a formal complaint that morning about unsafe working conditions, contract violations, and administrative retaliation. By 10:00am, my principal was being escorted.

She never tries to be their mom. The girls call her Rachel, sometimes Aunt Rachel when they're feeling affectionate. This morning was the four year anniversary. I always visit Sarah's grave alone. It's my day to fall apart without the girls seeing. But this year, Mia came into my room at 7 a. M. Dad, can Rachel come with us today? I think. I think mom would wanna meet her. My throat closed up. You sure, honey? Yeah, Rachel's part of our family now. Mama should know. We drove to the cemetery at 10:00am. The girls picked wildflowers from the field outside. Sarah always loved wildflowers more than expensive boo case. Rachel hung back near the car looking nervous. I knelt at Sarah's headstone, cleaning off some dirt and dead leaves. Lily placed her flowers down and whispered, hi, Mama, we miss you. I'm in second grade now. Mia is teaching me to ride a bike without training wheels like you did with her. Then Mia said, Mama, this is Rachel. She's daddy's girlfriend. She makes him smile again. She takes care of us really good. She helped me with my science project and she braids my hair for school. Rachel stepped forward, tears already streaming. She placed her flowers next to theirs. I never thought I'd love again after Michael died, she said quietly. But your husband and your daughter's brought light back into My life. I promise I'll take care of them. I'll never try to replace you. They'll always know how much you love them. That's when Mia pulled a folded paper from her jacket, a drawing, Sarah on one side, Rachel on the other, both holding her and Lily's hands, hearts floating above all four of them. I drew us as a family, she said, her voice cracking. Is that okay? I lost it. Rachel wrapped her arms around both girls. Lily looked up at me with Sarah's exact eyes and said, Mama's not mad, daddy. I dreamed about her last night. She said she sent Rachel to take care of us because she can't be here. I touched Sarah's name carved in the stone. The grief would never fully leave. I knew that. But for the first time in four years, it felt like she was giving me permission to build something new without forgetting what we had. Rachel squeezed my hand. Mia leaned against my shoulder. Lily placed one more flower on the grave. Thank you for sending her to us, I whispered.

Then I got to work. First I called her landlord, told him I've been covering rent but that arrangement was over. He thanked me for the heads up and said eviction notices go out after one missed payment. Second, her car insurance canceled. The policy was under my business account. One phone call. Third, the credit card she used for emergencies I'd co signed thinking she'd use it responsibly, frozen. Balance transferred entirely to her name. She called 47 times in 72 hours. I didn't answer. Her texts escalated from confused to panicked to furious. What is wrong with you? You're ruining my life over a joke. I replied once, figure it out. Within two weeks, the cracks showed. Her posts slowed. No more brunch photos. Then her boyfriend, the one she'd been tagging in couple photos, posted a story at dinner with someone else. The real fallout came at dad's retirement party. Vanessa showed up in old jeans and a hoodie, no makeup, hair unwashed. She looked small. Someone asked about her tulip trip. She said it was postponed. Another aunt asked about her brand deal. Vanessa mumbled something about negotiations. Then my cousin asked, wait, didn't your landlord post your apartment on Zillow? Vanessa's face went white. I stayed silent, let the tension build. Then my dad said, Vanessa, what's going on? She tried to deflect, laughed it off, said she was restructuring. That's when I spoke. She's not restructuring. She's evicted because I stopped paying her rent. Every head turned for six years, I continued. I covered her rent, her insurance, her hospital bills. And two weeks ago, she smashed cake in my face and called me a loser in front of all of you. So I stopped. Vanessa's mouth opened. Nothing came out. Dad looked at her. Is that true? I pulled out my phone, showed the spreadsheet, every payment, every text where she promised to pay me back next month. Mom's hand went to her mouth. Vanessa left without finishing her plate. Three weeks later, her car got repossessed. Her Instagram went dark. Then she deleted it entirely. Last week, she sent one final message. I hope you're happy you destroyed me. I replied, no, I just stopped rebuilding you.

The lead developer, Jake, kept saying and the same thing over and over, minimum 72 hours to rebuild this. Minimum. They were actively discussing calling the client to postpone. At 2:00am, I walked into the war room. All five developers were exhausted, staring at air logs that clearly made no sense to them. I can fix this in six hours, I said. Marcus actually laughed out loud. Full on laugh. You're an assistant. Looked directly at him. I'm a computer science graduate who's been watching you mess up architecture for 9 months. Your authentication flow is fundamentally broken. Your database isn't properly indexed. Your API handlers have race conditions. I've reviewed every single line of code in the repository. Jake's expression changed immediately. Wait, you've reviewed our code base every night for 9 months. I know exactly what's wrong. Your session management is creating orphan database connections that are overloading the system. I can rebuild the critical path, have it live by 8:00am. Marcus started to object, but Jake cut him off hard. Marcus Let her try. We have literally nothing else. Jake gave me full access to the production environment. I spent the next six hours completely rebuilding the authentication flow, implementing proper connection pooling, and adding all the database indexes they should have implemented months ago. At 7:00am, I pushed my changes live. The system came up clean. Every single health check passed green. The demo happened at 10:00am. It went perfectly. Client's CTO had attended remotely and had been given screen share access to monitor our technical work overnight. He watched everything I built in real time. After the presentation, after the client verbally agreed to sign the contract, their CTO asked Marcus a direct question. Who's the principal engineer who fixed your system overnight? The person working at 3:00am. That was genuinely incredible work. Marcus's face went completely white. That's actually my executive assistant. The CTO's entire expression changed. Your executive assistant just delivered senior level engineering work in six hours that your entire team said would take 72. I want her assigned to our account as a technical consultant. Make it part of the contract terms. This morning, the client formalized everything in writing. They're offering me a senior engineering role on their platform team at three times my current assistant salary. Marcus has to formally present me to the board this afternoon as their new technical lead. The dev team hasn't made eye contact with me all day.

So I cut her off financially. I'm the brother nobody brags about. No flashy car, no Instagram presence, just a guy who shows up to family events, eats quietly and leaves. What they don't know is that I own the building three of them live in. My sister Vanessa has always been the star influencer with 80,000 followers, always traveling, always posting, always thriving. What her followers don't see is the 2:00am Venmo request, the emergency rent payments, the hospital Bill I covered when her kid broke his arm and she'd let her insurance lapse. For six years, I was her silent ATM. Never asked for credit, never even told our parents. Then came Mom's birthday dinner. Vanessa arrived late, posting stories the whole way. When she finally sat down, she started her usual performance, talking about her business, her brand partnerships, her weekend trip to Tulum. I made one comment, just one, 1. Didn't you just ask me for rent money last week? The table went silent. Her face twisted. Then she smiled, that venomous smile she saves for people she's about to destroy. You know what your problem is, he said loud enough for everyone to hear. You're so bitter about your sad little life that you have to tear down anyone who's actually doing something. Our mom tried to interrupt. Vanessa talked over her. He sits in his depressing apartment with His depressing dog pretending his spreadsheets make him important. You're not successful. You're not mysterious. You're a pathetic loser who'll die alone. She picked up her slice of birthday cake, walked around the table and smashed it into my face. Frosting in my eyes, crumbs down my shirt. Her daughter laughed. Nobody stopped her. I stood up, wiped my face with a napkin, left without a word. That night, I opened my financial records. Every payment to Vanessa, time stamped and categorized and $31,000. Medical, $8,400. Car repairs, $3,200. Random emergencies, $12,600. Total, $55,200. Then.

When I tried to help two weeks later, I was the only one who could save the two million dollar deal. I'm 24 and work as an executive assistant at a tech startup called Data Bridge. I have a computer science degree from a good state university, but I graduated right into a massive tech hiring freeze and desperately needed income. The plan was to get my foot in the door, then transition to engineering within six months. That was nine months ago. My boss, Marcus, is 38 and runs the engineering division. From day one, he's introduced me to people as just my assistant. At company events, he makes jokes about how I couldn't hack it as a real engineer. So now I schedule meetings and order lunch. The dev team treats me like furniture unless they need something administrative. Three weeks ago, during a board meeting with potential investors, Marcus was presenting our authentication system. I was taking notes in the corner. He started explaining our security protocol completely wrong, mixing up encryption methods in a way that made us sound like amateurs. I quietly said, actually, we're using RSA2048, not AES for the key exchange. The room went silent. Marcus's face turned bright red. Stick scheduling, please. This is technical work. The investor shifted uncomfortably. I didn't say another word the rest of the meeting. The worst part is the dev team's Slack workspace. They have a channel called number sign Not for admin, where they discuss all their architecture decisions, can see in the sidebar that I'm specifically excluded from it. Sometimes they reference conversations from that channel in the general workspace and I just have to pretend I don't notice. But here's what none of them know. I have access to the company Gethub repository because I need it to manage documentation and user permissions. For the past 9 months, I've been reviewing their entire code base at night after everyone leaves. And honestly, it's a disaster. Critical bugs everywhere. Race conditions in the API handlers, database queries with no proper indexing. Their authentication flow has a vulnerability that could those user data. I've even built a side project at home using their exact text app, specifically fixing the scaling problems I knew they'd eventually hit. Two weeks ago, the company landed a massive demo with a potential client worth 2 million in annual recurring revenue. During the preparation meeting, I asked a basic question about their load testing results. Marcus didn't even let me finish. This is engineering work. You wouldn't understand the technical details. Three developers actually smirked at me. Then 48 hours before the demo at six PM on a Thursday, the entire production system crashed. Not running slow, completely down dead.

She was quietly asked to resign. Her husband's investors immediately withdrew. My parents'neighbors saw the news. They became social pariahs overnight. Dad's golf buddies avoided him. Mom's book club expelled her. The trial came eight months later. Their lawyer claimed they were teaching me about family values. Stella was never in danger. The jury was disgusted by Mom's note and Stella's tearful testimony. Meline testified trying to paint me as the villain. It backfired when the prosecutor asked, did you really tell your sister she could just get another child? I didn't mean it literally, Meline stammered. She's young. She could have more children, but I might never save my house. So your house was more important than your niece's well being? The jury deliberated under two hours. Guilty on all charges. Judge Bennetten was merciless. This represents one of the most callous acts of child endangerment I've seen in 20 years. The defendants use their granddaughter as a pawn. Being family makes their actions more reprehensible, not less. Dad got 24 months in prison. Mom got 20 months. Both ordered to pay Stella's therapy costs and came the four year restraining order. Any contact will result in additional criminal charges. Moline screamed from the gallery. They're her grandparents. The judge looked at my parents. You destroyed this relationship through your own choices. You have no one to blame but yourselves. The fallout continued. Moline lost her house to foreclosure anyway. Her marriage fell. Apart, they're now separated and filing for divorce. My parents burned through retirement savings on legal fees. Dad took early retirement. Mom lost her daycare job. Parents didn't want someone convicted of child abandonment near their kids. The ultimate irony, they're selling their own house. They destroyed their lives trying to save Moline's house and lost their own. Meanwhile, Stella is healing. I got a promotion. My boss said my strength impressed the company. Stella's college fund is thriving. They thought they were teaching me about family priorities. Instead, they taught me that real family doesn't abandon you or use children as weapons. The judge's verdict was brutal for them, but for us, it was liberation. Sometimes justice is the best revenge of all.

I'm 34 and Sarah died four years ago from leukemia. The diagnosis came 11 months after our second daughter was born. She fought for 19 months, left me with two daughters, Mia, 9, and Lily, for 18 months. After Sarah died, I was a shell. I'd find myself standing in the kitchen at 2:00am with no memory of getting there, couldn't look at family photos, couldn't sleep in our bed. I rotated between the couch and Mia's floor. My mom moved in after I forgot to feed the kids dinner three nights in a row. She'd find expired milk in the fridge and Mia making cereal for Lily. At 7 years old, the girls kept Sarah's side of the closet exactly how she left it. Sometimes I'd catch Lily sitting in there holding Sarah's favorite cardigan. Mia started sleeping with Sarah's old college sweatshirt. They'd ask me questions I couldn't answer. Does mama know I lost my first tooth? Can Mama see us from heaven? I was drowning. Until my mom forced me into a grief counseling group, too. Two years ago, that's where I met Rachel. She'd lost her fiance in a car accident six months before Sarah died. She was the only person who didn't say time heals everything or she's in a better place now. She just said, some days I forget he's gone for five minutes. Then I remember and it feels like dying all over again. We started meeting For coffee after sessions. Nothing romantic, just two broken people who understood why holidays felt like land mines and why grocery shopping could trigger panic attacks. She got it when I said I felt guilty laughing at a movie. She didn't judge me for still wearing my wedding ring. Eight months later, she texted me at eleven PM, bad night. Can't stop crying. I drove to her apartment with two pints of ice cream. We talked until 4:00am about the people we lost, the futures that died with him, the guilt of wanting to be happy again. We started dating a year ago. Slow, careful, I told the girls. After 3 months, Lily asked if Rachel was replacing Mama. I said no one could ever replace mama, but Rachel makes daddy feel less sad. Mia hugged Rachel and said Mama would want daddy to be happy. Rachel's been amazing with him. She reads the same bedtime stories Sarah used to does. The voice is exactly right.

But even I signed up for two shifts because whatever happened, it had to be devil astounding. Before the concert started, Mister Ford gathered us in a circle. We all held hands and he LED a prayer for Brielle and her family, a full prayer at a public school. Nobody said a word about separation of church and state because we were all just worried. The concert was awful. Nobody could focus. We missed cues, forgot entrances. Mister for didn't even care. Monday came, Brielle wasn't at school. Tuesday, nothing. Wednesday, still absent. People started asking if we should send flowers to her house or if that was too soon. Someone suggested a meal train. Then Thursday morning, Samantha came running up to our lunch table. She'd been friends with Brielle's younger sister on Instagram. You guys, she said, breathless. You guys, I figured out what happened. We all leaned in. Her sister got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Silence. That's it. Someone finally asked. That's it. The mom called her at the concert because they wanted to skip it and meet with the doctor that same night.

The reaction was immediate. People were pissed. We'd organized car pools to a funeral that didn't exist. Some kids had cried themselves to sleep. We'd rearranged our entire schedules for comfort shifts. Brielle came back to school the following Monday like nothing had happened. We wouldn't talk about it. Just said it was too painful to discuss. By lunch, someone had leaked the diabetes diagnosis in the group chat. Brielle got absolutely roasted, not bullied, just called out. People asking her why she screamed like that over diabetes, asking her if she understood what actual tragedy looked like. She switched school fools three weeks later. Her sister, by the way, is completely fine, plays varsity soccer now. Mister Ford still brings up that concert every year as a lesson in keeping perspective during actual emergencies.

Levi sat on the couch, glued to his mom's iPhone 16 Pro Max, completely unbothered by what he'd done. Dad walked over to him, snatched the phone from his hands without warning, and dropped it straight into a mug of steaming hot tea. The phone sank with a harsh, crackling pop. Andrea jumped up. Oh, my god! What are you doing? Before Michael could say a word, dad turned to me and gave a slight nod. I stepped forward, looked my brother straight in the eye, and raised my middle finger. Cold, direct, unwavering. Andrea shrieked, William, what the hell is wrong with you? Michael froze, face pale. Levi shrank into the couch, eyes wide. For the first time, dad stepped into Center. How does that feel? That feeling is precisely what William had to carry last night. Andrea pulled the ruined phone from the tea, hands shaking. Dad, that phone cost over $1,500! That's my property! Dad's voice was calm but sharp. And William's laptop was just trash. She froze. I'll call the police, then. Go ahead, dad said. And while you're at it, tell them what your kid did to William. The room went dead silent that night. At dinner, Michael finally spoke, his voice heavy with exhaustion. I I think it's time to take him somewhere. Somewhere that can help him start over. Dad nodded. A behavioral program. William, contact them for me. On Saturday, we drove Levi to the camp. He screamed for his mom the whole way, begging us to turn around. Michael gripped the steering wheel so tight. His knuckles turned white. When the gate closed behind Levi, I didn't feel relieved, just empty. It wasn't punishment. It was structure. Something he never had. One year later, everything changed. Michael and Andrea opened a small deli. They stopped making excuses and started listening. Levi sent me a handwritten letter. Half in English, half in broken German. Sorry, Uncle William. I was wrong. Since then, no more Defiance. No more ugly behavior. Every weekend, I bring him to my apartment. We play video games, eat fried chicken and talk. He's still stubborn, but now he knows when to stop.

I pulled out my phone and showed them the security footage from my office. Still clear. Levi pouring soda, sticking out his tongue, flipping me off. Andrea watched it, her face flickering with discomfort, then shrugged. He probably picked that up somewhere. It was just an accident. Michael leaned back. Don't make a big deal out of this. You're the adult here. That's when I lost it. That's what you call an accident? You saw the video? Are you all blind? The room went silent. My dad, sitting at the end of the table, said nothing, but his jaw was tight. Michael slammed his hand on the table. What the hell did you just say? Hey, William, Levi would never do that. Before I could respond, my dad's voice cut through. Everyone, sit down now. The room froze. Dad stood up, looked at Levi, and said firmly, Levi, what you did was wrong. Apologize to your uncle William. Levi said nothing. Andrea

I've already invited everyone. I crossed my arms. You never asked us. She waved dismissively. You can't say no. I've already ordered the cake, booked a DJ. You'd embarrass me if you cancel. How can I cancel something I never agreed to? She rolled her eyes. Saturday at seven PM. Then she left, texting furiously. Last year, Emily begged me to host her small gathering. I trusted her. What she promised would be ten close friends turned into 30 people. EDM blasting, beer pong on my dining table, shattered dishes, a guy smoking shisha in my living room. By nine PM, my neighbor knocked. Music is deafening. The whole building can hear it. When I cut the music and kicked everyone out, Emily looked at me like I'd ruined her life. But when I saw the beer soaked carpets, smoke, stench, broken plates, I swore she'd never host another party here again. Next morning, I woke to a text from mom. I'm so excited about Emily's party at your place. Emily? Had told the entire family without my permission. I opened the family group chat. Emily's message. This weekend is going to be amazing. Anna and Bradley's place is perfect. Bradley read over my shoulder and sighed. So what's the plan? I smiled. Just wait and see. For four days I stayed silent. Emily kept posting. Got the cake. We're having a DJ. Dress code white and gold. Meanwhile, I booked 2 plane tickets to the Maldives. We were leaving Saturday morning, one day before her party. Before we left, I stopped by my neighbor, Mister Williams apartment. We'll be away for a few days. If anyone causes trouble, especially my sister, please call the police. He raised an eyebrow, amused. Got it all planned out, huh? I don't make the same mistake twice. The night of Emily's party, I was on a beach in the Maldives, cocktail in hand. My phone started vibrating. Where are you? The door is locked. Open the door! Everyone's waiting. Are you kidding me? I opened my security camera app. On screen, fifth

He walked away quickly. That left a sour taste in my mouth. Why was his mom so dismissive of her son being put through torture? Well, now here Johnny was with Blake and his parents up on stage. The dad was checking his watch. The mom had her plastic smile on like everything was fine. But then Johnny held up a folder. For four years I've been exposed to escalating cruelty, brutal daily beatings and nobody did anything. His voice was steady now. Not the teachers, not the principal, not even my own mother. He opened the folder. I finally understand why. Silence. Complete silence. Johnny's eyes found the third row. Mom. I turned. A woman was sitting there, tears already streaming. Tell them what you did. She was shaking her head. Johnny, please, I'm begging you. Johnny, cut her off. Tell them I can't. Then I will. He took a deep breath. When I was 12, my mother sold me. He held up the paper and started reading from it. Full scholarship to Westbrook Academy. In exchange, Johnny becomes Blake crows punching bag. The auditorium erupted in gasps as he kept reading. Blake has anger issues. His therapist said he needed someone to take it out on someone who couldn't fight back. Some one too poor to sue. Mr Crow lunged forward. This is defamation. You'll be hearing from our lawyers, Johnny scoffed. Sue me. The contract has your signature right here. He Pointed at Mrs. Crow and yours. He pointed at his mother and yours. Mrs. Crow smile was gone. Blake looked defeated for the first time in his life. Principal Dawson was screaming for someone to kill the mic, but nobody moved. His mom tried to run, but people blocked the aisle. I've been exposed to daily beating. So the crow's precious son could have an outlet. And everyone on this stage cashed the check. He looked at his mother. You told me to keep my head down. She was sobbing. You told me it was for my future. He laughed. Old what future, mom? I haven't spoken in two years. I don't have a single friend. I flinch when anyone walks behind me. He turned to Blake. You didn't even know, did you? You just thought you were untouchable. Blake said nothing. You were because your parents bought you a toy and my mother sold them one. Johnny dropped a mic. It cracked against the stage floor. He walked off without looking back. The auditorium exploded. I found out later what happened. Johnny sued his mother, the crows and the School district. The contract was voided immediately. You can't sell a child as an abuse outlet. Settlement, $1.4 million. Blake was expelled, sent to a behavioral facility. Principal Dawson was fired. Johnny's mom lost custody.

The entire row of veterans broke. My niece Lily has this thing where she mixes up words constantly. She's 4, so nobody corrects her much. At home she calls the refrigerator the cold box and thinks escalators are moving stairs. We just smile and move on. But at Grandpa's funeral, she'd been on her best behavior for two hours, sitting quietly in her black dress with the white collar swing in her legs, whispering questions about why everyone looks so sad. Then the honor guard arrived. Seven soldiers in full dress uniform, crisp, silent. Their boots made the synchronized SoundOn the chapel floor that made everyone sit up straighter. They were carrying his flag folded into that perfect triangle. The whole room went completely still. Lily tugged my sleeve hard. Auntie, he whispered. But it was that kid whisper that everyone within 10 feet can hear. Are those the people Grandpa grounded? I froze. My sister's face went white. My mom closed her eyes. The, the veterans in the row ahead of us turned around. This old guy had to be at least 75 with medals covering half his chest, just stared at Lily. His face was doing this thing where you could tell he was trying so hard not to react. Sweetie, I whispered back, what do you mean grounded? She pointed directly at the honor Guard, you said Grandpa trained people in the army. Like when I'm bad and you ground me. No TV, no iPad, just thinking about what I did. The old veteran's shoulders started shaking. His wife grabbed his arm, but it was too late. He completely lost it, started crying, laughing so hard he had to cover his mouth with both hands. His whole body was shaking. Then the guy next to him caught it, then the woman next to him. Within 30 seconds, the entire row of veterans was struggling not to laugh at a military funeral. My sister was trying to shush Lily, her face bright red. But the laughter was spreading. It wasn't disrespectful laughter. It was this wave of something that felt like relief, like Lily had accidentally said the one thing everyone needed to hear. The honor guard stayed stone faced, professional. But I swear I saw the guy on the left, the one closest to us, his jaw twitch.

Any class over 30 students is required to have an educational assistant. I had 46. After a month and a half of barely surviving, I brought this up to my principal. She denied my request immediately. There's no money in the budget. Make it work or leave. I was stubborn. I thought I could handle it. To do the bare minimum of my job, I was at school from 6 a. M. To 9 p. M. Every weekday. Then I spent my entire weekend planning lessons and grading. I wasn't sleeping. I wasn't eating right. I was drowning. When my first evaluation came, I expected to be torn apart. Instead, my principal gave me all satisfactory marks. I was confused but relieved. I didn't realize she was setting me up. A few more weeks passed and I couldn't take it anymore. I contacted the union and explained everything, the class sizes, the impossible schedule, the lack of support. They said they'd handle it. Nothing changed. By Thanksgiving, I was completely burnt out. But I had two days off for the break. So I went to a potluck dinner with some old college friends, try and decompress. I started talking to this guy I barely knew and his husband about my new job. I mentioned how amazing my students were, how creative and smart, but how frustrated I was that I couldn't give them the attention they deserved. With 46 kids, it's in the room at once. The husband raised an eyebrow. What school do you work at? I told him I didn't think twice about it. That Monday morning at 805:00am, my principal came storming into my classroom. Her face was bright red. Her hands were shaking. She slammed the door so hard the windows rattled. You talk to someone about this school, about me, I'm going to have you fired. I'm going to make sure you never work in education again. You're done. I just stared at her, completely frozen. Then my phone buzzed. It was an email from the district office asking me to come in during my lunch break. Turns out the guy I talked to at Thanksgiving wasn't just some random person. He was a district superintendent. He'd filed a formal complaint that morning about unsafe working conditions, contract violations and administrative retaliation. By 10 a. M, my principal was being escorted out of the building by security. By noon, I had an educational assistant assigned to my classroom. By the end of the week, my schedule was completely redone with proper planning time.

His name was Johnny and he was staring straight at Blake, the kid who'd been tormenting him for the last four years. Principal Dawson rushed toward the stage. Johnny, sit down now. But Johnny didn't even look at him. Blake, get up here. Blake stood up three rows ahead of me. His cocky trademark grin had now faded. Johnny continued. And Blake's parents, I see you, too. You're not innocent either. Up here, his parents stood slowly looking at each other. Johnny's voice cut through. I said now. Something in his tone made them move. Everyone's phones were coming out. None of us knew what we were about to witness, but it had to be crazy to make the kid too shy for public speaking class to crash out like this. The thing was, despite being extremely quiet, everyone knew about Johnny. He came to Westbrook High freshman year on a full scholarship. Only scholarship kid in our grade. Poor family, single mom showed up wearing secondhand clothes and a backpack held together there with duct tape. He was quiet from day one, but I don't think he was born that way. I think Blake beat it out of him. From the first week of freshman year, Blake targeted him. Not normal bullying. Torture, locker shelves that left bruises, bathroom beatings where There weren't cameras, food dumped on his head, homework ripped apart. Johnny stopped eating in the cafeteria after sophomore year, started hiding in the library. Everyone saw it happening, but nobody did a thing. Blake had behavioral challenges. That's what the school called it. His family donated enough money to fund the new gym, the football team, the entire east wing renovation. We all originally thought Blake's family was just paying the school to do nothing about the bullying. There were rumors they were blackmailing Principal Dawson, but we quickly realized that couldn't be the case. You see, Johnny's own mother never came into school. I never saw her talking to Principal Dawson, never pressing for anything to be done about her son's bullying, even when he had black eyes or his books flushed down the toilet. I remember asking Johnny about his day once in junior year, a question that had nothing to do with his mom or the bullying. But he said, I told my mom about the bullying last night. She told me to deal with it. But this.

Like, is this really happening? Every 30 seconds, I have to pause so she can breathe. She's doing this weird gasping thing, trying not to make noise, but clearly in agony. I asked her multiple times if she wants to stop. Each time, she shakes her head violently and says to keep go going. At one point, she literally says, just get it done. I don't care. Like we're talking about ripping off a Band Aid and not a 15 hour tattoo project. An hour passes, and I've barely finished the outline of one wing tip, maybe 5% of the total design. She's full on sobbing now, shaking so hard I can't keep my line steady. Other clients in the shop are starting to look concerned. One guy waiting for his appointment asks if she's okay. I finally turn off my machine and tell her straight up, we need to stop. This isn't working, and I can't continue like this. She starts begging me to keep going, saying she can handle it, she just needs to push through. I tell her that's not how this works, that she's going to associate this tattoo with trauma and regret it forever. That's when she completely breaks down. Through sobs, she tells me her ex fiance just got engaged to someone else. They've been together six years, and he proposed to the new girl after only eight months. She wanted to get these wings, post them all over social media, show everyone she's thriving and has moved on and is doing something bold and beautiful. Beautiful? She admits she doesn't even really like angel wings that much. She just wanted something big and impressive that would get attention. Something that would make him see what he lost. I sat there for a minute, just processing all of that. Then I told her the most impressive thing she could do right now is be honest with herself. I offered to design her a small, simple feather instead. Something meaningful she could actually complete without torturing herself. Something for her, not for him. She agreed in the moment. Even paid me for the hour we'd spent. I drew up three different feather designs for her and told her to come back whenever she was ready. She never came back. Months later, I saw her Instagram, and she'd gotten a tiny heart tattoo at some other shop. Not even visible unless you knew where to look.

My first teaching job was at a Title 1 elementary school as an art teacher. I was 25, fresh out of college and so excited I couldn't sleep. The week before school started, that excitement died pretty fast. A week before classes began, I emailed the principal asking about my keys and badge so I could prep my classroom. No response. Called the office, nothing. I waited 3 days and finally contacted the district office directly. Two days before school started, I got an angry email from my principal saying I should have been more patient and that going to the district was inappropriate. She made me wait until the day before classes to get my keys. When I finally opened my classroom door, I froze. The room was completely packed with storage desks stacked to the ceiling, 100 chairs piled on top of each other, filing cabinets blocking the windows. I had less than 24 hours to make this functional. I worked until midnight clearing it out. The first day of school, I still didn't have a schedule. I had no idea which classes I was teaching or when. I emailed my principal at 7:00am asking for it. She replied twenty minutes later, accusing me of pressuring and bullying her. I apologized and asked again. She sent the schedule 10 minutes after the first bell rang. That's when I saw it. I had two classes. Scheduled at the same time, 46 kids in one room by myself. I also had seven 45 minute periods with no breaks except a 30 minute lunch. I was teaching every grade every single day of the week. There was no time to prep between classes, no time to set up materials, no time to even breathe. I went to my principal's office during lunch and asked if we could adjust this jewel. I explained I was losing instruction time because I had to scramble to get supplies ready while the next class was walking in. She came to my classroom that afternoon while students were waiting in the hallway. She didn't even lower her voice. You're a first year teacher. You don't know what you need. Deal with it or quit. I decided not to quit. Instead, I read the entire.

With a reaction like that, what else could it possibly be? People started organizing. Seriously organizing. Mallory created a shared Google DOC for funeral car pools. Samantha set up comfort shifts so someone would always be available to sit with Brielle. We had a rotation schedule and everything. I couldn't stand the girl, but even I signed up for two shifts. Because whatever happened, it had to be devastating. Before the concert started, Mister Ford gathered us in a circle. We all held hands, and he let a prayer for Brielle and her family. A full prayer at a public school. Nobody said a word about separation of church and state because we were all just worried. The concert was awful. Nobody could focus. We missed cues, forgot entrances for. Didn't even care. Monday came. Brielle wasn't at school. Tuesday, nothing. Wednesday, still absent. People started asking if we should send flowers to her house or if that was too soon. Someone suggested a meal train. Then Thursday morning, Samantha came running up to our lunch table. She'd been friends with Brielle's younger sister on Instagram. You guys, she said, breathless. You guys, I figured out what happened. We all leaned in. Her sister got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Silence. That's it? Someone finally asked. That's it. The mom called her at the concert because they wanted to skip it and meet with the doctor that same night. The appointment was scheduled for seven PM. Not hospitalized, not emergency surgery, not dying. A scheduled appointment to discuss a complete, completely manageable medical condition. The reaction was immediate. People were pissed. We'd organized car pools to a funeral that didn't exist. Some kids had cried themselves to sleep. We'd rearranged our entire schedules for comfort shifts. Brielle came back to school the following Monday like nothing had happened. Wouldn't talk about it. Just said it was too painful to discuss. By lunch, someone had leaked the diabetes diagnosis in the group chat. Brielle got absolutely roasted. Not bullied, just called out people asking her why she screamed like that over diabetes. Asking her if she understood what actual tragedy looked like. She switched school. It was three weeks later. Her sister, by the way, is completely fine. Plays varsity soccer now. Mister Ford still brings up that concert every year as a lesson in keeping perspective during actual emergencies.

Planted a nice Japanese maple instead. Looks way better, way more modern. You should see it. I stared at my phone, read it three times. That wasn't just any tree. That was Grandpa's tree. His final resting place. My hand was shaking when I typed back, don't worry, I'll handle the replacement. He sent a thumbs up emoji. Thanks. Knew you'd understand. Tree guys were expensive, but totally worth it. I sat there for a minute. Then I went to my filing cabinet, pulled out Grandpa's will, read the section again. I wish to be cremated and have my ashes scattered beneath the oak tree at 2847 Riverside Drive. This tree is to remain untouched as my memorial.

I called the county Environmental Protection office Monday morning first thing. Environmental Services. This is Marcus. Hi. I need to report a disturbance of a registered memorial site. Okay. Can you provide the registration number? I read it off the paperwork. Let me pull that up. Okay, I see it here. Oak Tree Memorial, registered 2,022. What's the nature of the disturbance? Someone cut down the entire tree. Removed it completely. Planted a different tree in its place. Silence on the other end. Then they cut down a registered memorial tree without permits? Yes, sir. That's a serious violation. That's a minimum 50,000 dollar fine. Up to 100,000 dollars, depending on circumstances. We'll need to send an inspector out immediately. Who owns the property? I gave him Mom's name and address. And who authorized the removal? My sister. She lives there too. She was copied on the original registration paperwork. So she knew it was protected? Yes. We'll be in touch. This is gonna be a substantial fine. Three days later, Wednesday afternoon, mom called me. I could hear her screaming. Before I even got

You removed a protected memorial without permits. That's on you. She hung up. The inspector called me that evening. Professional. Matter of fact, Mister Chen, I've completed my assessment. The violation is clear. Registered memorial site removed without authorization. No permits filed. The property owner will receive a formal citation and fine within two weeks.

So I got him banned from the building. So I live in a college dorm, and our entire floor is all girls. I'm pretty much always wearing a bra if I'm going outside or to class or whatever. But, like, if I'm just walking 10 feet down to fill up my water bottle or use the bathroom, I'm not putting on a bra. Nobody does that. It's our floor. We all live here, and half the time, people are walking around in pajamas or towels, going to the shower anyway. So a few days ago, I left my room to go to the water fountain. I was wearing a white tank top and no bra. The tank top wasn't see through or anything, but, yeah, you could probably see the outline if you were looking. I filled up my water bottle, walked back to my room. The whole thing took maybe two minutes. There was a small group of people hanging out in the hallway near some of the other rooms, but I didn't really pay attention to them. It's a dorm. People hang out in the halls all the time. About half an hour later, I hear a knock on my door. I open it, and it's one of the girls from that group in the hallway. I recognized her from orientation at the start of The year we talked a few times back then, she had this kind of awkward smile on her face and was like, hey, so sorry to ask you this, but if you go out into the hall again, could you maybe put a bra on? My boyfriend was out there, and he was kind of staring, so. I'm not a confrontational person at all. Like, I hate conflict. So I was just like, oh, yeah, sure. Sorry about that. Even though in my head, I was thinking, why is that my problem if your boyfriend can't control himself? But whatever. I didn't want to make it into a thing. So for the rest of that night, anytime I left my room, I threw on a bra or a hoodie. I figured that was the end of it. It wasn't. The next day, my roommate came back from the bathroom and told me she'd overheard the girl talking to her friends in there. She said the girl was making the whole thing sound completely different from what actually happened. He was telling them that I've been basically half naked, taking my sweet time at the water fountain, posing and arching my back to make my chest stick out, like I was purposely trying to get her boyfriend's attention. My roommate said the girl was literally acting it out at the water fountain, pretending to be me, pushing her chest out and everything. Her friends were all laughing. I was so annoyed. Like, I was out there for two minutes filling up a water bottle. I wasn't doing anything. But apparently this girl had turned it into some whole dramatic story where I was trying to seduce her boyfriend.

I was already in my pajamas, which was just a T-shirt and shorts, and obviously I wasn't wearing a bra because I was getting ready for bed. I passed the girl and a few of her friends in the hallway on my way to the bathroom. The girl looked directly at my chest, then looked at her friends, and they all started giggling. I just kept walking, but I was pissed. Then yesterday, the entire dorm got an email from our RA. It said she'd received some anonymous complaints about people not dressing appropriately in the hallways and asked everyone to please make sure they're keeping things covered up. I knew exactly who submitted that complaint. This girl had literally gone to the RA and complained about me not wearing a bra in my own dorm. I was done being nice about it. Remembered from orientation that the girl's boyfriend doesn't actually go to school here. He goes to some other college, like an hour away. I also remembered that because of the pandemic, our dorm has a rule that we're not allowed to have non student guests this year. Only students from our school and family members are allowed in the building. And on top of that, everyone has to wear a mask in the hallways, which is a rule that barely anyone follows, but it's still technically a rule. So I went to the same anonymous complaint. Form that the girl had obviously used. I submitted a complaint. I said I noticed people bringing their off campus boyfriends into the dorm and that these guests weren't wearing masks in the hallways. I kept it vague, didn't mention any names, just like she did with hers. This morning we all got another email from the RA. It said that due to anonymous complaints, they'd be enforcing the no off campus guests rule. From now on, anyone bringing a guest into the building would have to show their student ID at the front desk to prove they actually go to school here. And masks would be enforced in the hallways. I saw the girl in the hallway later that day, and she looked mad. She was on the phone with someone, probably her boyfriend, saying something like, I don't know. They're checking IDS now. You can't come over anymore.

He looked between us, his mother, his wife, his pen hovering over the paper. If you write May, Suzanne said slowly, we're done. I'll never speak to either of you again. Vincent will cut you off. The whole family will. My heart rate monitor started beeping faster. My husband stood up. You know what, mom? Good. He wrote may in clear black letters. Suzanne lunged for the clipboard, but he held it over his head. Security had been watching through the door. They Stepped in. Ma'am, you need to leave. The guard said, that's my grandchild. You're stealing her inheritance. Uncle Vincent arrived three hours later. He looked at the birth certificate, then at Susan, then burst out laughing. Susan, you psycho! I don't care what the kid's name is. Susan went white. But you said. I said, I'd love to meet Norman's great grandchild, not that she had to be named Norman. Jesus Christ! Who names a girl Norman? He pulled out the trust documents, right there in black and white. To any descendant of Norman Landry upon reaching majority. You lied. My husband said to his mother, you made this entire thing up. Suzanne's voice got caught in her throat. Vincent shook his head. Just like when we were kids, he said. You always had to control everything, make everything about you. No wonder your husband left.

I need your truck tomorrow. Then I started packing. Every piece of her clothing folded neatly, her books, bathroom items, makeup, medications, kitchen items, wedding gifts. Everything that was hers went into labeled boxes in the garage. This wasn't revenge. It was clarity. Monday morning, I installed new locks, new dead bolt, new door handle, new garage locks. Tuesday, I placed a note on the kitchen counter. Test results. I don't date people who play games. Your friend can help you find a new place. Next to it, her old keys and garage door opener. She returned Tuesday afternoon, exactly four days later. I watched her pull into the driveway with the confidence of someone who thought she held all the cards. Her key hit the lock and stopped. She tried again, jiggling the handle, then tried the garage. More rattling, more confusion. Finally, she rang the doorbell like a visitor. I opened it and stood in the doorway. Hi, why don't my keys work? Because I changed the locks. Why would you do that? Check the garage first, then we can talk. She walked to the garage with hesitant steps, lifted the door and stood frozen, staring at neat rows of boxes containing her entire life with me. What is this? Her voice had lost its confidence. That's your stuff. She came back, panic setting in. I was just taking time to think. No, you were testing me. I heard your entire conversation with your Friend, the color drained from her face. I was getting a snack in my own kitchen when you two planned out your psychological experiment in my living room. I can explain. You don't need to. Your divorced friend convinced you to test whether I was worthy of staying married to. So you packed everything because you were angry. I'm not angry. I'm clear. I don't date people who play psychological games. I continued. Did I get defensive? Did I try to control you, make it about myself, handle your space, really try to buy my way out. I passed your test. She had no answer. Test results are on the kitchen counter. She pushed past me, grabbed the note and read it. Her hands were shaking. This is how you end 6 years of marriage. I'm not ending anything. You ended it when you decided to test me instead of talking to me. Three months later, the divorce was finalized. Clean, simple, no contest.

N, O, R, m, a, N. I stared in shock. Norman. We're having a girl, of course, dear Susan said, reaching across the table to pat my hand. The Landry firstborns are always named after my father, Norman Landry. It's been our tradition for four generations. My husband squeezed my shoulder. Mom already ordered everything. The crib has Norman engraved on it. The baby kicked hard against my ribs like she was already protesting her fate. We've been living in my husband's childhood home for three months. While house hunting, not once had anyone mention this tradition. We picked may, I said, my voice shaking. We've been calling her may for months. Suzanne waved her hand dismissively. Nicknames are fine in private, but legally she'll be Norman. The words hung in the air. My husband followed me to our bedroom later that night. I was pulling up baby name websites when he closed my laptop. You're overreacting, he said. It's just a name. It's not just a name. You're asking me to name our daughter Norman. His face hardened in a way I'd never seen before. This is about respect. My grandfather built this family's wealth. Your grandfather has been dead for 30 years. He pulled out his phone and showed me a text from his uncle. See this? Uncle Vincent controls Grandpa Norman's trust, 2 million dollars Goes to Norman's namesake on their 18th birthday, but only if they're legally named Norman. My legs went weak. I sank onto the bed. $2 million. My husband's business had been struggling. We had no savings. After three rounds of IVF, the next weeks became a battle of wills. Suzanne started introducing me as Norman's mother at her church. She posted on Facebook about baby Norman arriving. Soon, my own mother called asking why I was named my granddaughter after an old man. During a prenatal appointment, the nurse pulled me aside. Just so you know, only biological parents can complete the birth certificate, not grandparents. We've had issues before. What kind of issues? She lowered her voice. Overbearing in laws trying to change names while mom's unconscious. We keep the forms locked now. That night, I told my husband what the nurse said. For the first time, I saw him think maybe we could hyphenate. He suggested quietly, May Norman. Suzanne slammed her hand on the table. Absolutely not. The trust specifically says Norman 1st name, no modifications. But he pulled up the document on his phone. He read it three times. Mom. It doesn't say that anywhere, Vincent told me. It just says a descendant named in honor of Norman Landry. May could be honoring him. Suzanne's face went red. Don't you dare disrespect your grandfather's memory. We prepared in secret. My husband filled out a practice birth.

This girl walks into my shop on a Tuesday afternoon wanting massive angel wings across her entire back. Not just any wings, though. She wants them hyper realistic, with individual feathers that start decaying and falling apart as they go down her spine. Super intricate, shading the whole thing. I pull up my portfolio and show her similar work I've done. She's nodding along enthusiastically, asking about color gradients and whether we can add gold highlights to certain feathers. I'm getting excited because this is the kind of project I love. So I start explaining the process. It's going to take at least four sessions, maybe five, each one around three hours minimum. The placement means we'll be working mostly over her ribs, pine, and shoulder blades, which are some of the most painful spots you can tattoo. I tell her all of this while sketching out the basic design. She's still nodding, still seems totally confident. Then casually, like it's no big deal, she mentions this will be her first tattoo. I actually put my pencil down and just look at her first tattoo. I asked her to repeat that because I must have heard wrong. She confirms it, smiling like this totally normal lady. I tell her I have clients with full sleeves who've tapped out on rib work. People who've sat through eight hour sessions without flinching will cry doing Ribs. She insists she has a high pain tolerance. Says she's done hot yoga and gotten through two root canals without numbing. I try to explain that tattoo pain is different. It's constant and builds over time, but she waves me off. She's researched this. She's ready. She wants to start today. Against my better judgment, I book her. I even offered to do a small test patch first on her shoulder blade, somewhere less painful, but she refuses. She wants to start the actual piece. We begin the outline on her right wing. Within five minutes, I can see her hands start to shake. At 10 minutes, she's gripping the table so hard, her knuckles are white. Tears are streaming down her face, but she keeps insisting she's fine through clenched teeth.

You should talk to this guy I know. He teaches coding to high schoolers. Pretty solid gig for folks who can't break into real development jobs. Bell laughed, didn't defend me. I glanced at mom. Nothing. Sounds like a great fallback for someone like you. I said. Ah, I'm in finance. Real world stuff. Dad chuckled. We could use more of that around here. That stung. I'd automated half his finances last year. I stayed quiet, but I knew something they didn't. I'd done my homework. His finance story didn't line up.

Yeah, those guys aren't exactly business minded. I pulled out my phone. What are you doing? Mom asked sharply. I opened my email. Start up stream. That firm your company is about to buy. I held up the screen. I own it. Silence. Brad's smirk melted. Mom blinked. Belle looked shocked. I built it. I licensed our product to three hedge funds last year. One is your firm.

So when my wife started her test and disappeared, I used those days to pack her things and change the locks. I was getting a late night snack when their voices drifted from the living room. At first I thought it was typical girl talk, but then I caught fragments that made me freeze with the fridge door halfway open. Trust me, men show their real colours when they think they're losing control. The friend was saying. Her divorce had been finalized just two months ago. You create a little distance, watch for these signs, then disappear for a few days. If he's got any red flags, he'll either turn desperate and pathetic or angry and controlling. I quietly moved closer to the doorway and just out of sight. But what if I'm wrong about him? My wife asked. You've been married for six years. Don't you think it's time to really test if he's the man you think he is? Her friend listed the five red flags getting defensive when questioned, controlling behavior, making everything about himself, not handling space well. Trying to fix problems with money instead of communication. The disappearing test is foolproof, the friend continued. Create some conflict. Tell him you need time to think, then stay somewhere for a few days. A good man will respect your space. A bad one Will become a stalker or throw a tantrum. My wife of six years was planning to test me like a lab rat. Because her bitter friend couldn't handle her own failed marriage. The ironic part, I didn't exhibit any of those red flags. But apparently that wasn't enough proof. Over the next week, followed the script perfectly. Strange fights about things that had never bothered her before. Monday, she accused me of being dismissive. Tuesday, she got upset I hadn't asked enough questions about her day. Wednesday, more manufactured scenarios. Friday evening, she delivered the finale while I was watching the game. I think I need some space. I need a few days to clear my head. I muted the TV. Okay, where are you thinking of going? She blinked, expecting resistance. My mom's house. Maybe for the weekend, possibly longer. All right. Drive safe. That's it? You're not going to ask what this is about? You said you need space to think. Asking questions would defeat the purpose, wouldn't it? The confusion in her eyes was priceless. This wasn't her friend's playbook. She packed Saturday morning and left as soon as her car disappeared.

I'm talking falling off my hips huge. So I took them to the tailor down the street. She took them in from a size 14 to a size 10. They fit perfectly after that. A few months later, even those were loose. I could pull them off without unbuttoning them. One Sunday I was at my parents house for dinner. My mom was complaining about her own clothes. Nothing fits right anymore. She said. I think I'm a 14 now. Maybe even a 16. I don't understand it. That's when I remembered the pants sitting in my closet. The altered ones. The next time I visited, I brought them in a shopping bag. Hey, mom, these don't fit me anymore. Want them? They're 14. Her face lit up. She loved getting free clothes. Oh, perfect. I'll try them on later. Two days later, she called me. Her voice was weird. Tight. Those pants you gave me don't fit. Really? They're 14. Well, they don't fit. They're too small. I must be bigger than I thought. I didn't say anything. Just let that sentence hang there. She kept talking. I don't understand. I thought I was a 14. Maybe I'm a 16 now. Or an 18. I need to start watching what I eat. I almost laughed. Almost. Instead I just said, yeah, sizes are weird like that. She started going to the gym the next week. Bought a peloton two months later. Started eating salads for lunch. Stopped making comments about my weight entirely. I never told her the pants were altered, never mentioned they were actually size tens tailored to fit my smaller body. She has no idea.

My mom called me fat my entire life. I got my period when I was 10 years old. Boobs came in, hips got wide, normal puberty stuff. But my mom took one look at me and decided I was overweight. She started putting me on diets immediately. While other kids ate pizza at lunch, I had celery sticks and low fat yogurt. She dragged me to stores with names like pretty plus, bought me clothes from the husky section even though I wore normal sizes. Every single shopping trip was torture. She'd hold up jeans and say things like these should fit around your middle. I was 12. This went on for years. Every holiday dinner, she'd watch what I put on my plate. Every beach vacation, she'd buy me oversized t shirts to wear over my swimsuit. When I graduated high school, she bought me a gym membership as a gift. The card said to a healthier you. I was 140 pounds and 5 foot 6. Then I got pregnant twice back to back. My son was born and 14 months later my daughter arrived. I gained 60 pounds total. My body was exhausted. I was running on three hours of sleep and living off whatever I could grab between diaper changes, granola bars, leftover Mac and cheese from the kids plates, drive through burgers at ten PM my mom had a field day. She started making comments every time she saw me. You Really? Let yourself go. Don't you want to fit into your old clothes? She said this stuff in front of my husband at family dinners. Once at the grocery store loud enough that the cashier heard. She bought me a book called Your Post Baby Body and left it on my kitchen counter. I started running 4:00am before the kids woke up. I ran every single morning for eight months straight. The weight came off fast, 70 pounds gone. I felt incredible. But here's the thing, my mom didn't notice. She still made the same comments, still bought me extra large shirts for my birthday, still told relatives I was working on it. My work pants got.

He got mad, but what was I supposed to do? They made the rule. But the absolute best moment was with the shoes. Jake and Becca left their shoes all over the living room rug constantly. Like, six pairs just scattered around. The closet was right there, but apparently walking three extra feet was too much work. I needed to vacuum one Saturday, and I was so done with moving their crap. I rolled up the entire living room rug with all their shoes inside it. Just wrapped them up like a burrito and set it against the wall. Then I vacuumed the whole house. Took me like, an hour, and I was almost done when Jake and Becca come out, ready to leave. They start looking around all confused, asking where their shoes are. I'm vacuuming, and I just yell over the noise, I didn't move them. I left them where I found them. They're checking the closet, under the couch by the door. Becca's getting annoyed because they're gonna be late. I finish vacuuming and start unrolling the rug to put it back. That's when all their shoes just tumble out onto the Floor. Jake literally yelled are you serious right now? And Becca called me a petty jerk. I just smiled and said I was following their advice. I grabbed their shoes and left all huffy. I thought they'd complain more, but honestly, after that everything changed. Becca started keeping her bathroom stuff in Jake's room. Shoes actually made it to the closet. Tyler moved his laptop charging station to his desk. The kitchen stayed cleaner because suddenly everyone realised I might start leaving things where I found them with the dirty dishes too. Best part is Becca eventually moved out for real after her expensive hair stuff kept getting ruined.

Nothing happened. I was starting to think maybe she actually Learned her lesson. But then Friday rolled around and I heard her getting ready in our room while I was in the common area studying. When I came back, she was gone and so was the fake foundation bottle. It was moved like two inches to the left. I didn't see her until the next morning. She came stumbling in around 2 in the morning and I pretended to be asleep. The next day I had an early Saturday shift at the library, so I left before she woke up. When I got back around noon, she was sitting on her bed looking at her phone with the angriest expression I've ever seen. Her face was straight up orange, like traffic cone orange. It was so bad. She had clearly tried to wipe some of it off because there were streaks on her jawline, but it had already set into her skin. She looked up when I walked in and I had to bite my tongue to keep from laughing. Did you notice anything weird about your foundation, she asked. Her voice was shaky like she was trying not to cry. I just shrugged and was like, know why? She showed me her Instagram and there were photos from whatever party she went to last night. The flash made it even Worse. She looked like an Oompa Loompa. People had tagged her in photos and there were comments with crying, laughing emojis. Someone literally commented, girl, what happened to your face with skull emojis. Everyone was staring at me all night, she said. I thought the lighting was just weird, but then I went to the bathroom and saw myself. People were literally laughing. I walked over to my desk and picked up the fake foundation bottle. Oh, weird. Maybe it oxidized or something that happens sometimes with makeup. She just stared at me. I could tell she was trying to figure out if I did it on purpose, but she couldn't prove anything. Yeah, maybe. She finally said she spent the rest of the day trying to scrub it off. Self Tanner had stained her skin so she was orange for like three more days. She had to skip her Monday classes because she was too embarrassed to go out in public. After that, she never touched my stuff again. Not my makeup, not my clothes, nothing. She barely even made eye contact with me for a week. Eventually things went back to semi normal, but she definitely Learned her lesson.

So I lived with three guys in college, and honestly, it was like living with toddlers who discovered pizza for the first time. I'm talking shoes everywhere, dishes in the sink for literal weeks. And don't even get me started on the bathroom situation. I was the only girl in this house, and somehow that automatically made me the maid. I didn't sign up for that, but whatever. I like things clean, so I dealt with it. The worst part was this one roommate, Jake, and his girlfriend Becca, who practically moved in without paying a single dollar in rent. She wasn't even on the lease, but her entire life was in our house. Like, I'm talking hair products, makeup, three different types of face wash, and she showered twice a day. Twice. Our water Bill was insane, and when I brought it up, everyone just shrugged. The bathroom was so packed with her stuff that I could barely clean it. Every time I tried to wipe down the shower, I'd knock over, like, 15 bottles of conditioner and some fancy hair mask thing that cost $40. I asked her nicely to please keep her stuff in Jake's room, since she didn't live there and wasn't paying rent. He looked at me like I asked her to donate a kidney. Jake got all defensive, and the other roommates backed him up. Because apparently, I was being unreasonable. One of them literally said, if you're so tired of cleaning up after us, just leave our stuff where you found it. They were all nodding like that was some genius solution. So I did exactly that. Next time I cleaned the bathroom, I didn't move a single bottle. I just sprayed everything down with scrubbing bubbles and let it sit. That fancy shampoo bar she had that cost, like, $60 melted into this weird, goopy pudding. Within a week, all her bottles got super slippery from the cleaner and kept falling over. She complained to Jake that her products were getting ruined, and he asked me about it. I just said I was leaving everything where I found it, like they told me to. Then there was this whole thing with one of my other roommates, Tyler, who always left his laptop plugged in right in the middle of the living room floor. The cord stretched across the walkway, and I'd already tripped over it twice. I asked him to move it, and he said the outlet was right there, so it was staying fine.

So I made sure she'd never do it again. So I had this roommate freshman year named Jess who literally could not understand the concept of personal space like at all. She'd walk into my room without knocking, eat my leftovers from the fridge. And worst of all, she kept using my makeup without asking. Not like a quick swipe of mascara either. I'm talking full face foundation, expensive eyeshadow, palettes, everything. First time I noticed I was getting ready for class and my favorite lipstick was just gone. Found it later on her desk with the cap off, completely dried out. I was annoyed but whatever. I said something and she was like, oh, my bad, I'll replace it, which she never did, by the way. Then it kept happening. My concealer would be half empty after the weekend. My brushes had different colored makeup on them that I definitely didn't use. One time I caught her red handed using my highlighter and she literally just laughed and said, you have such good taste. I couldn't help myself. I told her probably five or six times to stop. She'd always say the same thing that it wasn't a big deal and we're roommates so we share stuff. But I never agreed to share my makeup that I paid for with money from my campus job. She had her own makeup. It just wasn't as nice as mine because I actually saved up For quality stuff. The breaking point was when I came back from winter break. I had this foundation that cost me like $70. I know that sounds insane, but I have sensitive skin and it was the only one that didn't make me break out. I kept it in a specific spot on my desk. I got back to our dorm and immediately knew something was off. The bottle was in the wrong place. And when I picked it up, it was way lighter than it should have been. She'd used almost half of it while I was gone and she didn't even bother wiping off the rim. So there was dried foundation caked around the top. I was so mad I literally had to leave the room before I said something I'd regret that night. I came up with my plan. I went to the drugstore and bought the cheapest foundation I could find, like $3. Then I stopped by the makeup aisle and grab this self tanning lotion that was super orange. Back in my room, I mix them together in the cheap bottle until it looked somewhat normal. Not perfect, but close enough that just wouldn't notice. Since she clearly didn't pay attention to details, I took my real foundation and hid it in my closet behind my winter coats. Then I put the fake one in the exact spot where I usually.

I wrote out my last meal request on Wednesday, 47 ingredients, every measurement and technique precise. My mother's meatloaf recipe from memory. The guard took the form and left. An hour later, the prison chef showed up at my cell. You, Preston? Yeah. What is this? He asked, holding up my form. Meatloaf. This is a novel, not a recipe. Ground beef, 60% ground pork, 40%. Bread crumbs soaked in whole milk for exactly 10 minutes. Three eggs beaten until frothy. Yellow onion, not white, sauteed in butter until translucent. Ash time, not dried. Worcestershire, 2 tablespoons, no substitutes. Tomato paste, garlic pressed, not minced. Paprika, black pepper, sea salt, not table salt. And this glaze, half cup ketchup, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, mustard powder. Brush on at 340 degrees. Twenty minutes before done, he looked at me through the bars. Why so specific how my mother made it. Your mother was a chef? No, just a mom who made meatloaf every birthday. Some of these ingredients we don't stock. Fresh thyme, whole milk, real butter. We'll have to special order them. I have 48 hours, he sighed. I'll do my best. It's your last meal. You deserve it, right? Thank you. He turned back. Your mom must have been something special. She was. She died five years ago. I'm sorry. Me too. But if I'm going to die Friday, I want to taste your cooking. One last time, the chef nodded. I'll make it exactly how you wrote it. The chef called the warden. Half these ingredients aren't in our inventory. I need to special order them. Suppliers can deliver Thursday morning, but this recipe takes eight hours minimum. The warden checked his watch. Execution is Friday at six PM you have time? Barely. Thursday morning, 8:00am, the ingredients arrived and the chef started cooking. I could smell it from my cell. An hour later, onions sauteing and butter. Mom's kitchen. Saturday mornings, her humming while she cooked. Sat on my bunk and cried. First time in eight years a guard walked by. You okay, Preston? Yeah. Just smells like home. Thursday afternoon, the chef ran into problems. The oven temperature wasn't holding steady. He had to recalibrate, start over on the glaze twice. It has to be perfect, he told the warden. It's his last meal. Thursday night, I couldn't sleep. Not from fear, from the smell, the meatloaf aching through the night. My lawyer stopped calling months ago. My appeals were done. My family stopped visiting two years ago. They believed I killed Rebecca. I was alone with this meatloaf and memories of my mother. Friday morning, execute Today, 10:00am. No meal yet. Noon, the chef. The glaze isn't right yet. Two PM, a guard brought regular lunch. Where's my last meal? Chef says it's not ready. Four hours left. Four PM, Two hours until they killed me. The smell was stronger. The Glaze caramelizing. Guards walked by to smell it. Five PM, One hour left, the warden came to my cell. Your meal isn't ready. We're delaying the execution two hours until eight PM six PM, the original execution time came and went. I was still alive waiting for meatloaf. It was absurd. I almost laughed. At least my mom's recipe was causing trouble. One last time. Seven PM, the smell was overwhelming, exactly like I remembered. Seven thirty PM, the chef appeared at my cell with a covered plate. He looked exhausted. I'm sorry it took so long. He uncovered it. The meatloaf looked exactly like my mother's. I ate slowly, savored every bite. It was perfect. Exactly like I remembered. The chef watched me eat. It's right. It's perfect. I finished the last bite at seven fifty one PM, Nine minutes left. The guard opened my cell. Time to go, Preston. They walked me down the hallway, past other cells. Inmates were silent. They always were during execution walks. We reached the preparation room. The chaplain was waiting. Mister Preston, would you like to pray? No.

Yes, Sheldon. If you finish early, you can take it again. Begin. And I was off. I flew through wave functions. I dominated harmonic oscillators. The only challenging part of this exam was trying to balance the desire to finish quickly with the urge to stop and smell my freshly sharpened pencil. Hmm, only one question left. All I needed to do was solve Schrodinger's equation in a cylindrical well by employing the zeros of the bezel function, which of course were. Wait, what are they? Oh, dear. Alright, Sheldon, time to turn in your test. I'm not done yet. I know you like to add your own better questions at the end, but for the last time, I don't count them. I just need a few more minutes on this problem. That's an easy one. Just apply the zeros of the vessel function. I can't remember what the zeros of the vessel function are. You didn't memorize them. Of course I did. Then what's the problem? I'm blinking. Sorry, son. Class is over. No, I can do this. It's just one question. You'll still pass. Sheldon Cooper doesn't just pass.

In a nuclear plant, we use something called fission. We take an unstable element like uranium 2, 3, 5, which has too many neutrons. A neutron is a. The bullet. Yes, the bullet. Bullets are flying off of the uranium. The bullets from one atom will eventually strike another atom. The force of this impact splits that atom apart, releasing a tremendous amount of energy, fission and the graphite.

She only stopped when he let out a scream of frustration. It turned out the girl's name was Natasha. She always felt insecure because she couldn't find a boyfriend thanks to her less than appealing appearance. One day, Natasha went to see a psychiatrist for treatment. Unexpectedly, she fell in love with the handsome Peter at first sight. So she sat next to Peter and placed her hand on his leg. Her move made Peter feel a sudden rush of heat. Just as she was about to make the next move, the office light suddenly flicked on and interrupted them. After regaining his senses, Peter quickly stood up and left. However, Natasha looked at the bulge in Peter's pants and flashed an evil grin. The next day, Peter and his girlfriend were out shopping for a wedding dress. At that moment, Natasha sent him a message saying she wanted to talk to him in the bathroom. Peter, curious, walked into the bathroom. Suddenly, Natasha hugged him and kissed him. Just as Peter was about to push her away, his girlfriend walked in to ask his opinion on the wedding dress color. This moment completely freaked Peter out. He quickly covered Natasha's mouth and responded in a shaky voice, hoping his girlfriend wouldn't find out. Unexpectedly, Natasha snuck into Peter's house that night, claiming she wanted to be with him no matter what price. She Had to pay. But Peter, who was about to get married, didn't want anything to do with Natasha and told her to leave. Just as he was about to call the police, Natasha suddenly picked up a vase and hit Peter, then sat on top of him. Unexpectedly, she tried to force herself on him. Just as Natasha was about to succeed, Peter's girlfriend showed up just in time and saved him. In the end, Natasha was arrested and Peter and his girlfriend went on to live a happy life.

So long as you look like a Newborn baby, they are willing to mate with you. I'm poor, so I have this contour palette and this contour stick. I regret buying both. I must warn you, the transition from beginning to end might be startling. First things first. Check your flash. As you can see here, I have no flash. Contouring is a very dangerous game. Once a man walked in on me while I was contouring. I had to pretend I was schizophrenic so he'd think that I was playing in Cat Shit and he'd leave me alone. It was a sad day. If the men find out we can shape shift, they're going to tell the church. Eliminate the nose. You can pretend that you have no nostrils. Men will be bewitched and hand over their wallets. Men don't like nostrils. You want to look like a pterodactyl. Men love pterodactyls. Beautiful.

I met Addison when we were 4 years old and I instantly had the biggest crush on her since that day. It only got bigger as we went through school. But I never had the courage to tell her how I felt. And although I told myself I was okay with just being her friend, I wanted to admit it so badly. I never thought she felt the same way about me because she was always dating other guys and would always vent to me about all the different boyfriends she had over the years. But after 12 years of this torture, I finally decided I had to tell her. I knew I couldn't say it out loud, so I wrote it all down on a piece of paper and plan to give it to her. I was tired of pretending I didn't like her and knew she had to know. I wrote my feelings down and went to school that day breathing faster than normal. I was beyond nervous, freaking out thinking about how she'd react when I gave it to her. I read it over one more time and took a giant breath before walking towards her locker. But weirdly, when I got closer, I saw a crowd of people around where her locker was. And when I got closer, I realized they were around Addison. I had to know what was going on. So I folded that piece of paper in My pocket and walked closer to see she was crying. And when she saw me, she walked over to give me a hug. What happened, I asked. When she answered, I felt like my entire world was collapsing around me. Remember that pain in my hip I told you about? It's cancer. They told me I might not have very long. She was crying into my shoulder in front of everyone and I hugged her back. What did that mean? Months? Weeks? I felt like my earth was shattering. But she asked if I wanted to skip school and spend the day with her. I instantly agreed. And on the way out, I threw that letter into the trash. I went with her to every chemo appointment, but they told her it was getting worse. And every time she'd walk out of that doctor's office crying, I just hug her. I wanted to tell her how I felt, but I didn't think she saw me like that. That was until she dropped the bomb that the doctors only gave her a few weeks left. I didn't know what to think anymore because I was about to lose my best friend. But she wanted to make the most of it. One night while all our friends were all hanging out after everyone else went to bed, it was just me and Addison. She had lost her hair and a lot of weight, but that didn't matter. I still thought that she. Was beautiful. I was looking at her and I don't know why, but out of nowhere she asked me if she could tell me a secret. I just nodded, trying not to think about what it would be like without her. But she said, you might never wanna talk to me again after this. I've always wanted to tell you that I've had a crush on you. I didn't think I heard her right. What? What did you say? I'm really sorry. I know that's so weird because I'm probably like a sister to you. I was shocked. Really? You have a crush on me? I said nervously, yeah, sorry if that ruins our friendship. I just felt like I needed to tell you since I don't have much longer. I always tried to make sure I had a boyfriend to try and make you jealous. My jaw literally dropped. I couldn't believe what she was saying was real. I instantly folded and told her everything. I wrote her a note that day I found out how she was everything I thought about how I wish I told her sooner. She just looked at me, even though I'm gonna die, I don't even have any hair anymore. You don't have to say that just to be nice. But I looked at her, really looked, and she knew I wasn't joking. We both broke down crying right there. That night we started dating and although we didn't have long, we made It work. We spent every day together and I tried my best to make sure she could do everything she wanted to do before she went. Eventually she couldn't get out of bed, but I didn't let that stop me. I wanted to give her the best date for our one week anniversary. I brought a bunch of rose petals in my guitar to her hospital room and set everything up while she was sleeping. I was so excited for her to wake up and see everything because I actually Learned her favorite song on the guitar. But before she could, one of the machines she was hooked up to started beeping. I didn't know what was going on. But the nurses started coming in, checking things, gradually looking more panicked. They were yelling at each other, telling them to bring the doctor. But when the doctor got there, he took one look at her heart monitor and then at me. He gave me a nod and I knew what it meant. She didn't have long. She was starting to open her eyes because of all the yelling. But when she saw me, she smiled. She had enough strength to look around the room seeing what I did for her. But I think she knew this was it. I held her hand and as I sang her favorite song to her, she passed away. I miss her so much.

So it's my husband's 40th birthday. I'm in the kitchen making potato salad, right? Hair tied up, apron on, trying to get everything ready before his family shows up. He comes in complaining that I forgot to pick up the ice. I'm like, babe, it's on the list. I'm getting it in an hour. He rolls his eyes hard. Of course you forgot. can't even handle basic party planning without screwing something up. Then he mutters, no wonder I have to double check everything you do. I just stood there, spatula in hand, trying not to cry. But my 11 year old daughter Grace was sitting at the table decorating his birthday cake. I heard everything. She didn't say a word, just kept piping frosting. I wiped my eyes and went to grab the ice. When I came back, Grace was still working on that cake, hadn't looked up once. I tried to peek at what she was writing, but she angled it away. It's a surprise, mom, she said quietly. Her voice had this edge I'd never heard before. This wasn't the first time he talked to me like that. Little digs here, insults there, always when he thought the kids weren't paying attention. But Grace is a smart kid. He's been paying attention. I kept running around setting up tables, pretending everything was fine. That's what I always did. Smile through it. Don't make A scene. Meanwhile, my chest felt tight and my hands were shaking. An hour later, guests start arriving. His parents, his brother, co workers, everyone. We're all in the backyard. I'm playing the perfect hostess, refilling drinks, laughing at jokes that aren't funny. His mom pulled me aside and squeezed my hand. You look tired, sweetie. You doing okay? I just nodded. I always said I was fine. Grace had disappeared with the cake. I figured she was adding final touches. I was too busy making sure his drunk uncle didn't fall into the pool and that there were enough burgers on the grill. Then his brother clinked a glass. Speech time and cake. Everyone gathered around. Grace came through the sliding door carrying that cake like it was the Olympic torch. Face completely serious. Candles were lit, flickering in the evening breeze. Everyone started singing. His face lit up like a little kids. He loves being the center of attention. I stood there singing along, watching him soak it all in, feeling this weird mix of resentment and sadness. This man I'd spent 15 years with, this man who used to bring me flowers, now he couldn't talk to me. With basic respect, Grace place the cake down right in front of him. She stepped back, arms crossed and waited. Then he sees it written in massive blue frosting letters across the entire cake. Apologize to mom first. Dead silence. His mom gasps. His brother's trying not to laugh. He's turning red, stammering Grace, this isn't funny. She crosses her arms. Neither is how you talk to her. No cake until you apologize. I'm serious. His face went through about five different emotions, shock, anger, embarrassment, panic. He looked at me like I'd put her up to it. I just shook my head. This was all her. His co worker broke the silence. What's this about, man? Now he's really sweating. His mom wasn't smiling anymore. She had this look on her face like pieces were clicking into place. His mom nodded slowly. She's right, son. Now everyone's staring at him waiting. His brother crossed his arms. His dad raised an eyebrow. The silence was so thick you could cut it with a knife. Grace didn't budge, didn't break eye contact with her father. This little 11 year old girl standing her ground against a grown man who'd just been humiliated in front of everyone he knew. I saw his jaw clench for a second. I thought he might explode. But he looked around at all those faces judging him in real time and something shifted. Finally he looks at me and says, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. His voice cracked a little or maybe he was just cornered. Either way, Grace wasn't satisfied. Say you're sorry for all of it, dad. Not just today. He swallowed hard, looked at the ground. I'm sorry for, for how I've been treating you. You don't deserve that. The backyard Was still silent. Then his mom started clapping, slow, but first. Then his brother joined in. And suddenly everyone was clapping. Not for him, for Grace, for me. Grace smiles. Good. Now everyone can eat. She cut him the smallest slice. His mom got the biggest. I've never been prouder.

We were on the train coming back home from dinner with my family. My husband sat next to me, scrolling through his phone with his jaw clenched, still bitter that I dragged him there. I tried to break the silence between us, showing him a funny video from my phone, bringing up a dramatic story from work. But he didn't look up, not even for a second. Fine, I thought, giving up. He'd been distant for months anyway, so it's not like this was new to me. The next stop, a group of men stumbled on, five of them. Loud and drunk. They stood near us, laughing and moving around erratically in a way that made everyone else on the train uncomfortable. One of them noticed me immediately. Hey, look at this one, he said to his friends loud enough for half the train to hear. I kept my eyes down. The guy moved closer. You're too pretty to look so sad. Smile for me. I didn't respond. He chuckled and leaned in close to my face. Hey, I'm talking to you. His breath reeked of whiskey. Please leave me alone, I said quietly. His friends laughed. One of them whistled. The first guy reached out and touched my hair, swinging his hips toward my face. I flinched and pulled away, glaring and shaking. Don't touch me. He grinned and did it again, this time tugging at my clothes. Relax. I'm being friendly. I want us to be friends, he whispered in my ear. I turned to my husband, hoping he'd help me out. Our eyes met for half a second and then he looked away, turning his shoulder before he continued scrolling through his phone while me, his wife, continued getting harassed on the train. The guy noticed and patted my husband's shoulder. Ah, husband giving you the cold shoulder. Guess that means you're free. Game. The man pulled me out of my chair, holding my wrist tight while his other arm slipped around my waist. Let's dance, he said, swaying behind me. Stop it, I said louder, watching more and more people stare. His friends were egging him on, laughing like it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen. Finally, an older woman across from.

The champagne glass nearly slipped from my hand. He's here right now? Yeah, he's at the bar right there. But don't worry. He did anger management, and he's supposedly a totally different person. I turned and saw him across the reception hall, chatting with the groom. The last time I'd seen him, Liam, I'd been on the bathroom floor, spitting teeth into my palm while he stood over me fixing his hair in the mirror. Now he was laughing, holding a beer. Then he saw me watching. He raised his glass in a small toast and smiled. Not his old aggressive smile. Something softer, apologetic. I excused myself to the bathroom, my heels clicking too loud on the marble floor. In the mirror, I fixed my lipstick with shaking hands and told myself, maybe he had changed. Maybe I could get through the wedding. But when I came out, he was waiting in the hallway. I froze, but he held up both hands, palms out. He said, I know you don't want to talk to me. I just wanted to say I'm sorry. The therapy made me understand what I did. His voice was different, calmer. He said, I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm different now. I walked past him, and he let me go. He even stepped aside to give me more room. Back at the reception, I tried to Relax. Maybe he really had changed. Twenty minutes later, a groomsman I didn't know approached me. He said, you're the maid of honor, right? The bride needs you on the roof deck. Something about her dress. I said, what's wrong with her dress? He said, I don't know. She just said it's an emergency and to get you right away. I followed him to the service elevator. He pressed the button for the roof and said, she's pretty upset. Something tore. The elevator opened to the roof deck, where the venue sometimes did ceremonies. But it was dark, no lights on, and I didn't see the bride anywhere. I turned to ask the groomsman, but he was already back in the elevator. Doors closing, I called out, wait, but the door is shut. I pulled out my phone to call the bride, but had no signal up here. Then I heard footsteps behind me. Liam stepped out from behind the ventilation unit. He said, she's not coming. Her dress is fine. My blood went cold. I ran for the elevator, but he was faster, blocking me. I tried to dodge around him, but he grabbed my wrist, the familiar grip that left bruises for weeks. He said, that was my cousin who brought you up. Told him you and I needed to talk privately about the restraining order. He was happy to help. And don't worry, he won't tell anyone you were dumb enough to follow me. He'll say he Never saw you. No matter what happens. I tried to pull away, but he twisted my

Rafael and I were that couple everyone roots for. I'm known for my ridiculous positivity. The girl who finds joy in traffic jams and rainy days. That pisses normal people off. Three years in, and he still looks at me like I hung the moon. We cook dinner together every night, dancing to terrible music. His friends say I'm the light of his life. I've never been someone who cried. Ever. It started with small things. I canceled movie night too help my mom with something. Rafael offered to come. I said no too quickly. The next week, I was staring at my phone during dinner. Even though I used to preach about table manners, he asked who was texting. Just my mom, I said, flipping it back into my pocket. My hands were trembling. Two weeks later, I was crying in the bathroom at his birthday party. His sister found me, mascara everywhere. I blamed it on work stress. That definitely sounded like a lie. She told Rafael I was acting suspicious. After that, he started watching me closer. He noticed I wasn't eating much, not singing in the shower anymore. When he surprised me with lunch at work, I wasn't there. My coworker mentioned I've been taking long breaks lately, coming back with red eyes. He started talking to my roommate, Ulyssa. She admitted I've been crying myself to sleep. He confronted me that night. What's going on? Are You seeing someone else? The question broke something in me. I sobbed harder than I ever had. I couldn't catch my breath. He held me, but I saw fear in his eyes. Just tell me what's wrong, he begged. I opened my mouth. I almost said it. But then I remembered what's been keeping me quiet this whole time. His dad. He went through three years of cancer. Rafael holding his dad's hand in hospice. Rafael not eating for weeks after. Rafael telling me that watching someone die of cancer broke something in him he was still fixing. He's in therapy now, finally healing. So I couldn't do it. I couldn't make him relive that nightmare. My mom had maybe three months. The doctors were clear. I've been driving her to chemo every Tuesday and Thursday. The days I told him I had meetings. The experimental treatment she was doing wasn't working. She was getting weaker. Yesterday she forgot my name for 10 seconds. Rafael was still waiting for an answer. I wiped my face. I don't think I can do this anymore, I whispered. It wasn't what I meant to say. I meant I couldn't do this. Watching my mom disappear while pretending everything was fine. But he heard something else. You're breaking up with me? His voice cracked. I was about to correct him and explain and what I meant, but then he said my mom was right. She said, you've been distant since you visited your parents. Last month. Last month when we got the diagnosis. When the doctor said aggressive and limited options. When my dad collapsed in the hospital parking lot. I'm sorry. I managed. It was all I could say. Without lying or telling the truth. Raphael stood up. I deserve someone who actually wants to be here. Someone who isn't checked out. Each word was a knife, but I took it. Because he was right. I wasn't here. I was in oncology wards and support groups and medical trials. I was googling survival rates at 3:00am and planning for a world without her. He packed his things. Five minutes to erase three years. At the door, he turned. Whatever is really going on with you, I hope you figure it out. I nodded, tears streaming. He thought my tears were about us, but it was about the text I just got. Honey, can you drive me to chemo tomorrow? Dad's too upset to drive straight. I heard the door slam. Two months later, Rafael ran into my dad at the grocery store. Dad looked exhausted. By saltines and ginger ale, the same things Raphael's mom used to buy. They stood awkwardly by the soup aisle. So how's she? Raphael asked, trying to be polite. About the breakup. Taking it day by day, dad said vaguely. His eyes lit up. The breakups been hard on her, too? Dad looked confused. Breakup? No, I meant everything else. What everything else? Dad studied him. She didn't Tell you why she ended things

It all started in junior year after me and my girlfriend Thalia broke up. You see, Thalia and I had dated for six months. Nothing dramatic. Just six months of hand holding and awkward first kisses before we mutually decided we were better as friends. No hard feelings, no drama. We'd even joke about it sometimes. Then she started dating Shay, this varsity wrestler with a muscular build and huge ego. I remember the exact moment everything changed. I was at my locker when I heard his voice behind me. What's up, buddy? The way he said it, dripping with this weird aggression, made my stomach drop. Before I could turn around, his fist connected with my chest so hard, I slammed back into the lockers. Later, I found out he'd been scrolling through Thalia's Instagram and found our old couple photos. Apparently, his brain couldn't process his girlfriend had dated someone who chose books over the gym. The thing was, it became this sick ritual. Every single day, same performance. What's up, squirt? Followed by a chest punch. Left bruises I'd examine in the bathroom mirror at night. Purple and green patches spreading across my ribs like watercolors. At first, Thalia would tell him to stop, but he'd just laugh and say we were just playing around. Eventually, she stopped saying anything at all. She'd just look away. And somehow that hurt worse than the punches. Everyone Knew why he did it. I'd catch the whispers. That's Thalia's ex. Whenever it happened, my friends kept saying to just avoid them. But we were in all in the same friend circles. Same classes, name, everything. The breaking point came on a Tuesday. Thalia and I got paired for Chemistry Lab. And for twenty minutes, it was like old times. We were laughing about Mr. Telford's too pay shifting when he got excited about covalent bonds. Just innocent, stupid stuff. But Shay saw us from across the cafeteria, and I watched his face go dark. He didn't even say his usual line. He just walked over. And by the look in his eyes, I knew this was going to be different. Punch that landed on my lanky, malnourished self knocked the wind out of me completely. I was on the ground wheezing, making these pathetic gasping sounds while everyone stared. Thalia stood there, frozen between helping me and standing by him. And she chose him. Of course she did. I walked home instead of going to class. And with each step, something inside me shifted. I was done being the victim in his stupid power play. Done being the example of what happens when you date his girlfriend before him. By the time I got home, I knew exactly what to do. I decided to go on Amazon and order a surprise for Shay. Something that no one could see coming. Something that would make Shay cry. His eyes Out! What the hell are you doing with that? My brother asked when he saw the order history. I lied and told him it was for a school project, and he believed me. When it arrived two days later, I felt the surprise in my hands and thought about how much it would make him regret how he treated me. It was thicker than I expected, but solid. Like holding a piece of metal that could ruin his life. That morning, walking into school wearing it under my hoodie, my heart was pounding so hard I thought everyone could hear it. But there was this chaos in my chest. This wild excitement mixing with terror. I deliberately walked past their usual spot by the junior lockers. Lunchtime, main hallway. Maximum audience. If I was doing this, everyone was going to see it. When Shay saw me, a helpless

She now tried walking down the aisle at my wedding and I finally got payback. Growing up, my sister Brianna was the golden child, and I mean golden. When I was 7, I saved up birthday money for months to buy this doll I wanted. The day I brought it home, Brianna threw a tantrum saying she wanted it. My parents made me give it to her because she's more sensitive and needs extra love. I cried for hours. They grounded me for making Brianna feel bad with my crying. At 13, I got straight A's for the first time. My parents took me and Brianna to celebrate at the restaurant Brianna picked with the cake flavor Brianna liked even though I hate chocolate. When I asked why my achievement party was all about her, my dad said I was being selfish and ungrateful. Brianna smirked at me the whole dinner. At 16, I worked after school for eight months and saved $2,000 for a used car. My parents found my savings envelope hidden in my closet and took it. I use my money to pay for Brianna's driving lessons and insurance because she needed a car more than me since she had anxiety about taking the bus. When I begged for it back, they said family helps, fam. I didn't get a single dollar back. Brianna got her license in a car while I took the bus for Two more years. Every single time Brianna came first, I stopped expecting anything different. Fast forward 10 years, I'm engaged to the most amazing guy, Logan. I didn't want Brianna in the wedding at all, but my parents called me crying, if Brianna isn't the maid of honor, we're not coming. We'll tell the whole family you excluded your sister on purpose. I caved because I didn't want the drama. Biggest mistake of my life. During rehearsal, Brianna, I started her comments, white isn't really your color. You'd look better in cream or maybe blush. This song's too slow for the bridesmaids. It'll drag and bore people. Oh, and I've been thinking I should walk down the aisle, too, right before you. It would look so elegant having both sisters make an entrance. People will love it. I shut her down hard. No changes. This is my wedding, not yours, she pouted. But I thought that was the end of it. Wedding day arrives. I'm in the bridal suite getting ready when my coordinator rushes in panic. Your sister brought a white dress, like wedding white. She says it's cream, but it's white. White. I told her to handle it and just keep Brianna away from me until the ceremony. The ceremony starts. My bridesmaids walk down perfectly. Then suddenly the music changes. Not my chosen song. I look up, confused, and Brianna standing at the back of the aisle in that white dress holding a bouquet. I definitely didn't Get of her posing like she's the bride. My parents are in the front row smiling and filming like this was. And all along my mom's literally crying happy tears. I'm frozen at the altar. Logan squeezes my hand and with.

That's when I made the call. I texted her sister and told her I needed help installing a ceiling fan. Total lie. Just needed her to come over. Her sister always flirted with me at family dinners. She was objectively more attractive than my girlfriend. More successful, more everything. My girlfriend was insanely jealous of her. The golden child with the full ride medical school scholarships while she sat at home streaming to nobody. When she showed up, I didn't even pretend to care about the ceiling fan. We talked for maybe 20 minutes before it happened. We spent the entire weekend together. And honestly, it was the best I'd felt in years. For the first time since I could remember, someone made me feel wanted. She was gentle, asked me how I was doing, actually listened when I talked. She made me feel like a human being instead of a walking paycheck. My girlfriend treated intimacy like a chore she had to get through. Her sister made it feel like connection, like guy actually mattered. Sunday night, my girlfriend came home, walked in all smiles, clearly still riding the high from her weekend with my so called best friend. I waited until she sat down, then I confronted her about the cheating. She lied straight to my face, didn't even hesitate, looked me dead in the eyes and said I was being paranoid, that I was making things Up. That I needed therapy for my trust issues. So I told her the truth. I said, I know you spent the weekend with him. I read every message. And you wanna know something funny? While you were there, I was here with your sister. Her face went blank. I kept go. Not only is your sister 10 times better than you at everything. Med school, scholarships, actual human decency, she's way hotter, too. And we spent your entire weekend together. Multiple times. The look on her face was pure devastation. Her mouth opened, but nothing came out. Her golden child sister

We started messing around with free use during lockdowns and it was a lot of fun. A few times I had to use my safe word for one reason or another. I decided that in 2022 I was going to challenge myself to never use it. I didn't tell my husband, but I think he could sense it because he has really started to test the limits. The other night he was having a couple friends over that he hasn't hung out with much and I was excited to have a night to myself so I could take a long bath and read my new book. They were downstairs watching some gaming thing. After my bath, I put on a silk slip, lay in bed and got back into my book. My phone buzzed and I looked at the text. Hubby, they don't believe me that you are for years. Come show them what a good girl you are. I was a little flustered. I didn't expect this. We've done some exhibition stuff before, but it had been a while and it was usually in a more planned out way. My thoughts raced as I considered what I was going to do. My phone buzzed again. Hubby, it's been three minutes and your mouth still isn't on. My pee, pee. I was nervous as f, but I went downstairs anyway. When I walked into The room, the friends were shifting anxiously in their chairs. Without a word, I positioned myself on my knees in front of hubby and pulled down his shorts. I put his semi hard pee, pee in my mouth and went to work. The room was quiet except for the sounds of announcers shouting on the TV and the noise of my lips and tongue sloppily working all over his P P. He pulled up the back of my slip so they could see my s s. I had a fall on underneath, probably disappointing for them. It usually takes him a while to see him from a, B, L, W, J, B. But this time he was starting to breathe heavily. After just a few minutes, he pulled my hair back so they could see my face. With one hand full of my hair and the other grasping my ass as he began thrusting, I held still as he emptied his ball straight into my throat. I finished swallowing and sucked him clean. I got up, licked my lips and said enjoy the games to his friends before heading back upstairs. As I turned the corner, I heard one of them mutter, no effing way. I ran back to our bedroom where I hid until they were gone.

Now I'm worried he'll break up with me. So I have three guy friends I've known since college. Back then, we were all single and honestly, pretty wild. I hooked up with all of them at different times, sometimes together. It was a phase. Nothing emotional, just young and stupid. That stopped years ago when we all grew up. Two of them are now in serious relationships with two of my best friends. Everyone knows the history, and we moved past it. Or so I thought. My boyfriend Liam and I have been together a year, and it's been the best relationship of my life. We clicked instantly, and I knew within weeks this man was endgame material. The only issue is I'm his first serious girlfriend, so he gets insecure sometimes, especially knowing about my past. I've been completely honest with him about my history with these guys. I told him it meant nothing, that it's ancient history and he's all I want now. He said he understood and trusted me. I even asked my guy friends privately to never bring it up out of respect. Last Saturday, we're all hanging out at my place. It's me, Lee, and my three guy friends and my two best friends. Normal night, everyone's drinking and playing cards. Around ten PM, I head out with one of my girlfriends to grab more beer and snacks. From the store, we're gone maybe 20 minutes. When I walk back in with the groceries, Liam's entire energy has shifted. He's sitting on the couch staring at his phone, won't make eye contact. The guys are laughing about something. I can tell immediately something's wrong. You okay, babe? I ask him. He forces a smile and says, yeah, I'm good. But I know him. He's not good. We stay another hour, but he barely talks. When we finally leave and get in my car, he's silent. I drive us back to my apartment, and the second we're inside, I press him. Liam, what happened? You were fine before I left. He sits on my couch, watch, and his jaw clenches. Your friends wouldn't shut up about being Eskimo brothers. They kept making jokes about how I got the leftovers and asking if one guy is another you after you've had all three of them. My blood went cold. They said what? They kept saying things like welcome to the club. And asking if I could satisfy you the same way they couldn't, saying, at least now you've settled down with just one guy. I felt sick. These were supposed to be my friends. Liam, I'm so sorry. I'll talk to them. They said you told them I was insecure about your past.

Mom and dad were worth millions. Built their company from nothing, lived in a mansion that looked like it was ripped from Architectural Digest. Every family gathering was a networking event where my siblings would pitch their latest business ideas or drop hints about their financial struggles. The four of us had always assumed we'd split everything equally when they died. We assumed wrong. The lawyer's office was act. My brother Beckham flew in from Dubai, where he was closing deals. My sister Harley interrupted her honeymoon in Bali. My other brother, Felix, brought his lawyer, already prepared to contest whatever the will said. I came straight from my shift at the hospital where I work as a nurse. Your parents left specific instructions, the lawyer said, pulling up a projector screen. Your inheritance will be determined by your score on this quiz. A Kahoot game loaded on the screen. Family trivia. 50 questions. A lawyer handed us tablets. This is insane, Beckham said. They can't be serious. Question one, the lawyer read. What was your mother's middle name? I typed Lorelai. Felix typed Lauren. Beckham and Harley were frantically texting each other. The results flashed on screen. Only I got it right. Question 2. What was your father's first job? I typed janitor. My siblings put various tech positions wrong, wrong, wrong. By question 10, the pattern was clear. Beckham had three correct Harley had two, Felix had four. I had 10. What medication did mom take daily? I knew it was metformin for her diabetes. My siblings didn't even know she was diabetic. Dad's biggest fear? Heights. He told me during our monthly lunches when my siblings were too busy to show up. The name of mom's chemotherapy nurse. Alyssa. I knew because I went to every appointment. Mom had cancer. Harley yelled, this is bullshit! Beckham stood up. How are we supposed to know mom had cancer? She never told us she did. I said quietly, at Sunday dinners, you just never came. The questions got more personal. What made dad cry at his 70th birthday? I typed, when no one but Jocelyn me showed up. Correct. What was Mom's favorite book? The one I gave her last Christmas. My siblings hadn't given gifts in years, just sent assistance with gift cards. Where did your parents have their first date? The diner on Fifth Street. Dad told the story every anniversary dinner. I was the only child who attended them. Beckham threw his tablet down at question 30. This is rigged. You obviously help them make this. When did your parents renew their vows? Last summer in their backyard. I was the only witness. My siblings were at various retreats, conferences, and yacht parties. What surgery did dad have in 2,019? Triple bypass. They were all too busy to visit. I took three weeks off work. The final question appeared. What did Your parents value most, I typed. Being seen as people, not checkbooks. The final scores flashed me 48 out of fifty. Felix, 7 out of 50. Beckham, 5 out of 50. Harley, 4 out of 50. The lawyer clicked to the next screen. A video message from my parents appeared. If you're watching this.

Will fail within a month. He said, decline it. You're not leadership material. That night, I started planning. First, I opened a secret bank account, funneling small amounts from cash back at grocery stores. Then I rented a studio apartment two towns over under my middle name. A burner phone created a new identity. Slowly, carefully. Six months later, I had everything ready. On a Tuesday morning, I left for my usual run along the river trail, left my phone, wallet and wedding ring on the bridge railing, my running shoe at the edge like I jumped. Current was strong that week. Three people had drowned that year. Perfect cover. I watched from across the river as police arrived. Richard sobbing dramatically for the cameras. She was so fragile. I knew she couldn't handle the pressure. The search lasted three days, divers, helicopters, news coverage. Richard gave interviews about my mental struggles and how he'd tried to protect me from myself, me. Meanwhile, I was in my studio apartment, hair dyed black, working remotely under my new identity. I watched Richard's performance on The news, the grieving widower. He even started a mental health foundation in my name, which he used to fund his gambling habit, I later Learned. Three months in, he moved his secretary into our house. Four months in, he sold my jewelry, claiming it was too painful to keep. Five months in, he proposed to the secretary with my grandmother's ring. Six months in, the day before his wedding, I came back, walked into the church.

She walks straight up to my chair, yanks off the kid's hoodie and shouts, explain this, you jingle nut! The second I saw his head, I nearly dropped my clippers. Half his hair was buzzed to the scalp, the other half still long, and right in the middle was a bald patch that looked like someone took a cheese grater to his skull. I tried to keep straight face and said, ma'am, I swear we didn't do this. But she wasn't buying it. She slammed her purse on the counter and said, we were here last week. Don't try to lie. Her kid looked terrified. I leaned in and quietly asked, hey, buddy, did you really get this haircut here? He looked at me, then at his mom, and whispered, no, my mom did it. The whole shop froze. Even the clippers went silent. She shot him a death glare and said, excuse me. The kid panicked. I, I mean, yes, sir, you did it. I meant you. But it was too late. Everyone in the shop burst out laughing. One barber had to sit down, another was wiping his eyes. The guy getting a low taper fade couldn't hold it in. I turned back to her and said, so, just to be clear, you gave him this haircut? And then came here to blame us. Her face turned bright red. I just wanted to fix it a little. But he moved. It's not my fault. I felt bad for the kid, so I told him, alright, hop in, let's fix this up. Gave him a clean fade, fixed everything, and handed him the mirror. He looked at himself and said, Yo, I actually look human again. His mom grabbed her purse and rushed out without saying a word. A week later, the kid came back with a girl this time and handed me 10 bucks. He smiled and said, thanks for saving my life.

He shrugged, yeah, go for it. Alright then. Not my hair, not my problem. I grabbed the clippers and started buzzing. Halfway through, I asked him one more time just to be certain. He looked in the mirror, grinned, and said, bro, I should have done this ages ago. I finished up, brushed him off, and handed him the mirror. His face. He slid up.

Then she stormed out. A couple of seconds later, the kid walks back in alone, slides a thirty dollar Bill onto the counter, and says, sorry about that. I actually love it.

But the government erased him from the records. The entire room went dead silent. Someone finally asked, you mean Larry Paige and Sergey Brin?

Someone asked, okay, then, if your family made Google, what exactly did they invent? Steve, dead serious, says they figured out how to make computers think like humans. It was called G1. Someone in the back yells, bro, what are you even saying? Steve's face turned red, but instead of backing down, he doubled down, started yelling about How history is fake, how his family has the real files. And then he ran out of the classroom. The next day, he showed up with some printed out documents in old cursive and went, this document proves it. It's from the original Google files. That's when it all fell apart. One guy in the back pulled out his phone, reverse search the image, and the first result that popped up was a Pinterest post titled Old Looking Tech Documents for Aesthetic School Projects. The whole class erupted. Even the professor lost it. One guy yelled, bro, found this on Tumblr. Steve turned bright red and shouted, you're all brainwashed! Then stormed out.

But clearly, the wound was way beyond healing, and it was spreading fast. Not long ago, while on a mission, he had accidentally touched a mysterious object. The very obelisk everyone was searching for. The mission went fine, but what he didn't know was that even after changing the material of his arm before touching it, the obelisk's deadly power still got to him. He realized just how Serious? This was because at this rate, he'd end up just like the waitress. Lost, helpless, with no idea what to do. The loud noise outside finally pushed him over the edge. He stepped out, ready to confront the people causing trouble, when a woman suddenly appeared in front of him, saying she could help him heal.

My little brother got his own iPad when he was 4. I told my mom that was probably the worst idea ever, but she didn't think it was a big deal. Screens are the new textbooks. He's basically studying. She said, sure, your kid can't sit through a meal without watching five Tik Toks between bites. Then one dinner proved exactly what I've been saying all along. We've got one simple rule, no devices at the table, just 30 minutes of actual human interaction. No screens, no games, just talking to each other like normal people. But that night, my brother Bart, now 7, walked in and sat down with his full setup. He had his iPad propped up, scrolling non stop through short videos, eating like a robot, not even blinking. My dad looked over and said, Bart, no screens at dinner. Come on, put it away. But Bart didn't even flinch, just kept chewing, eyes locked on the screen like he was hypnotized. So my dad finally reached across the table and just grabbed the iPad. That's when all hell broke loose. Started crying and screaming like someone just deleted his entire Minecraft world. Dad stayed calm and said it's just dinner. You know the rules. But Bart was crashing out. Then my mom stepped in. If you don't stop, you're grounded for a month. No iPad at all. That shut him down immediately. He froze. Wiped his face, picked up his fork and finished his food without saying a single word. This, this is the same kid who never shuts up. Now he's chewing his food in complete silence, afraid of losing his precious iPad. Dinner ended. We cleared the table and not even 5 minutes later, he was back on the couch, iPad in hand, doom scrolling like nothing ever happened.

Back in college, there was this guy named Steve who lied about everything. Not small stuff, either. This dude claimed he turned down the Olympics because he wasn't in the mood to be famous. But one day, the wildest thing happened in history class. We were talking about major tech companies when Steve casually goes, fun fact, my great, great grandfather actually created Google. But the government erased him from the records. The entire room went dead silent. Someone finally asked, you mean Larry Paige and Sergey Brin? Steve just shook his head and said, nah, that's what they want you to think. The truth's been buried. You'll only find what they want you to see. Even the professor looked confused. Steve, do you even know how Google works? He replied, yeah, my grandpa invented the algorithm. They just renamed it and erased us. But class exploded. People were crying, laughing. Even the professor had to turn around to hide his face. But Steve wasn't done. He stood up and said, I swear on my life, I've got proof at home. Someone asked, okay, then, if your family made Google, what exactly did they invent? Steve, dead serious, says they figured out how to make computers think like humans. It was called G1. Someone in the back yells, bro, what are you even saying? Steve's face turned red, but instead of backing down, he doubled down, started yelling about How history is fake, how his family has the real files. And then he ran out of the classroom. The next day, he showed up with some printed out documents in old cursive and went, this document proves it. It's from the original Google files. That's when it all fell apart. One guy in the back pulled out his phone, reverse search the image, and the first result that popped up was a Pinterest post titled Old Looking Tech Documents for Aesthetic School Projects. The whole class erupted. Even the professor lost it. One guy yelled, bro, found this on Tumblr. Steve turned bright red and shouted, you're all brainwashed! Then stormed out. We never saw him in that class again.

They instantly realised these three were immortals, so they hurried to take them to the Emperor, because the Emperor was searching the entire land for people with strange powers, all for the sake of living forever. At that moment, the Dark Sorcerer was showing off his head cutting spell in front of the emperor. The Emperor watched and was very pleased. So he asked how he could achieve an immortal body. The Dark Sorcerer said it only required 1,000 years. The emperor was furious when he heard that and threw the sorcerer's severed head onto the ground. Soldiers then brought Zhang Ziya in. Zhang Ziya took out a divine artifact and said that as long as it was opened by the true ruler of the world, heavenly punishment would not fall. The emperor was doubtful, but the dark sorcerer was shocked when he saw it, as he knew how powerful it was. He said the artifact could absorb the soul of the dead. So the emperor decided to test it. He pulled out his sword and sat on the man on the spot, then kicked him to the ground. The soul flew out and was pulled into the artifact, but the emperor did not receive its recognition. The artifact broke free from his hand. John Zhao realized the poor emperor was not the true ruler, so he quickly grabbed the artifact back to escape from his place. He lied and said, He still needed a few more steps to open it. Then he began pretending to cast spells while slowly stepping toward the door. The dark sorcerer sensed something was wrong. The Emperor saw this and ordered his men to surround them. But mortals were no match for immortals. They summoned their weapons and easily took down the soldier. At that moment, the dark sorcerer blocked the door, so Nisa used his weapon to tie up John Zira. And at the very moment the door closed, he threw him out, showing John Zira 800 meters away. Outside the hall, countless soldiers rushed forward, but none of them stopped the two immortals. 絶対

Nobody can see into our yard because of the fence. Our neighbors on both sides are at work during the day.

Everyone in my grade was panicking. Kids were making study schedules three weeks out, forming study groups, buying practice book. My friend Tyrell dude made flashcards, physical flashcard in 2024. I'm talking color coded, laminated, organized by subject like he was preparing for the SATs. Meanwhile, I'm over here telling myself, yeah, I'll study. I got time. Week before the exam, I discovered this new show, binge the entire thing in three days. Two days before, my cousin wanted to play basketball all afternoon. Did I say no? Absolutely not. We were out there for hours. I came home sweaty, exhausted, and still haven't cracked open a single notebook. The night before, I'm sitting at my desk, note stack, textbooks open, highlighters ready. I'm ready to lock in. Then I remembered I was stuck on this one level in my game. Just one level, I told myself. One Level turned into 12. Suddenly it's 2:00am. I'm half asleep and I've looked at exactly zero pages of notes. I went to bed thinking, well, it's been a good run. Next morning I dragged myself to school, running on four hours of sleep and vibe, literally just vibes. No breakfast, no confidence, no clue. I walk into that classroom and everyone's doing last minute cramming. Terrell's flipping through his flashcards like his life depends on it. Another kids rocking back and forth, mumbling formulas. One girl looked like she was about to cry. Test start. Open the booklet. First question, no idea. Second question, also no idea. I'm reading these questions like I've never seen the English language before. Math section, straight guessing, science, picking answers that sounded right. Reading comprehension. I'm out here choosing based on what I would have done in that situation. If the character seemed chill, I picked C. If they seemed stressed, I went with B. That was my system. 30 minutes in, I'm done. Not because I finished carefully, because there's no point staring at questions I don't know. I turned it in and my teacher just looked at me that disappointed headshake that says I'm not even surprised.

He took extra shifts at work just to afford the application fees. My mom never helped with any of it and always said I should just stay local and save money. When I didn't get accepted anywhere, it crushed both of us. My dad blamed himself for years, thinking he couldn't give me enough opportunities. I, I just accepted that I wasn't smart enough. So when I knocked over a shoebox in the attic and a bunch of envelopes spilled out onto the floor, I didn't think much of it at first. Then I looked closer. They all had my name on them. Every single one had already been opened. I picked one up and my hand started shaking when I recognized the logo. It was from one of the colleges I applied to back in high school. I opened the letter and had to read it three times because my brain refused to accept what I was seeing. It was an acceptance letter. They wanted me. And I never. Knew I looked.

Last week, my 10 year old daughter Lucy came home with clumps of her hair missing from scalp. Before I could ask her what was going on, she sprinted up the stairs and slammed her door shut. Leave me alone, daddy. I don't wanna talk about it. I wanted to tell myself that something probably happened after a weird game with her friends or maybe it was an accident. But there was a pattern. For the last two months, Lucy had come home sick every single day. I'd let her stay home whenever she showed symptoms and make sure she was 100% healthy before sending her to school again. But every time without fail, she'd get sick again. She was never healthy for longer than three days at a time. I figured it was just her immune system. But now with the clumps of hair missing, I knew something darker was going on. I went upstairs and knocked on her door. Honey, what happened at school today? No response. I asked again. Still nothing. I'm not mad, sweetie. I just need to know what's going on. That's when I heard it. She started crying, the kind of crying that would make any father's stomach drop with anxiety. I told you to leave me alone, daddy. I didn't sleep that night. My mind kept racing with every horrible possibility. Was someone hurting? Her? Was she being bullied? Was a teacher doing something? I had no idea what was happening to my little girl, and she wouldn't let me help her. The next morning, I called her best friend's mom. I figured maybe she must know something. I tried to sound casual, asked if she had mentioned anything weird going on at school. There was this long pause then.

I tried to sound casual, asked if she had mentioned anything weird going on at school. There was this long pause. Then she said something that made my blood run cold. Actually, my daughter came home with hair missing on Tuesday. I thought she'd cut it herself, but she wouldn't tell me why. My heart started pounding. Lucy wasn't the only one involved in whatever was going on. I spent the next two hours calling every parent on the class contact list. Every single one had the same story. Their kid had come home with chunks of hair missing at some point in the last two weeks. And when I mentioned the constant sickness, they all confirmed that, too. Their kids had been getting sick over and over for months. None of us had connected the dots until now. I felt sick to my stomach. Something was happening to an entire classroom of children and not one of us knew what it was. The next morning, six of us showed up at the principal's office. We weren't asking anymore. We were demanding answers. The principal looked genuinely concerned. He pulled up the security footage from the past month, classrooms, hallways, playground. We watched for over an hour. Nothing. The teachers weren't doing anything wrong. No older kids were going near them. No strangers on campus. There was literally no evidence of anything happening to these kids. The principal promised to investigate further, but I could see on his face that he was just as confused as we were that night. I tried asking Lucy one more time. I researched on wiki how, on how to deal with situations like this and went for a softer approach. I sat on the edge of her bed and took a deep breath. Whatever is going on, I'm not going to be mad. I'm not going to be disappointed. I just need to know that you're safe, honey. She looked at me with these big, terrified eyes and said, daddy, please just drop it. If you find out what's going on, I'll get in so much trouble, no one will want to be friends with me anymore. That sentence kept me up all.

The day I met Harold, I had a black eye. I was trying to hide with sunglasses and a hoodie even though it was 90 degrees outside. I was moving boxes into my new apartment, the one I'd rented under my mother's Maiden name with cash I've been secretly saving for 18 months. He was sitting on the bench outside our building feeding pigeons. That's a lot of boxes for one person, he said, I'm managing. I said, without stopping, I'm sure you are. Something about the way he said it made me pause. Not pity, just quiet acknowledgement, like he'd seen people like me before. His name was Harold and he lived next door. Over the next few weeks, he became the closest thing I had to a friend in this new city. He brought me soup when I was sick. He sat with me on the balcony, told me stories about his late wife, his career, that he was always vague about the daughter he lost too young, Vivian. He said her name like a prayer. How did she die? I asked once. His face changed before he smiled sadly. She trusted the wrong person. Two months into my new life, I was starting to believe I might actually be okay. Then I found the note under my windshield wiper. I will always find you. Stan knew where I was and Was coming that night. Harold knocked on my door. He took one look at me and said, tell me what's wrong. For the first time in years, I did. Harold didn't react the way I expected. No shock, no panic, no empty reassurances. He just listened. And when I was done, he said something strange. I'm going to help you, but I need you to.

When dad died, everyone expected the usual family drama over his will. My sister Emma got the big house in the suburbs. My brother got his vintage Mustang collection worth probably $40,000. Me, I got handed this white envelope by the lawyer with a note inside that just said, grow up. Go pay your own rent for once. I'm 32 years old, and I've been living in my parents'basement since college. Yeah, I know how that sounds. I'd switch jobs every few months. Always had some excuse about why I couldn't afford my own place. Truth is, I was comfortable being a disappointment. Everyone at the reading just stared at me holding this stupid note. My sister tried to act sympathetic, but I could tell she was relieved she didn't have to deal with me moving in with her. My brother just shrugged and said dad was probably trying to teach me a lesson. Lesson? The man leaves me literally nothing while my siblings get set for life. And it's supposed to be educational. I had nowhere to go, so I crashed on my cousin Danny's couch in his studio apartment. Annie worked construction and left at 5 every morning, so I had to find something to do with myself. I started stocking shelves at this grocery store downtown. The manager was this older woman who didn't care that I'd never held a Job longer than six months. He just needed someone who'd show up. Then I got a second job. Delivering food at night. I'd never worked two jobs before in my life. Every single dollar went towards saving for a security deposit somewhere. I stopped buying beer, stopped ordering takeout, stopped playing video games until three in the morning. The anger kept me focused. I was pissed at dad for embarrassing me. Pissed at myself for being such a mess. Six months of sleeping on Danny's couch and working 14 hour days. I finally had enough saved for a tiny place across town. That's when I got this weird letter forwarded from Dad's old address. It was from some real estate company I'd never heard of. I called the number, and this agent told me to come to their office immediately. Bring identification. She said there's been a mistake in our records. I thought maybe dad had screwed up some paperwork before he died.

I thought everyone heard the vacuum cleaner screaming when it turned on. For years my parents told me I was being dramatic when I covered my ears during everyday stuff. Turns out I wasn't dramatic at all. When I was little, probably like three or four, I'd always ask my mom why the T. V. Was so loud. Check the volume and it would be on like 15, which is pretty normal, but to me it sounded like someone was yelling in my ear. My parents thought I was just being a weird kid. As I got older, things got worse. Started wearing these chunky noise cancelling headphones to school assemblies because the microphone feedback made me wanna throw up. During fire drills I would literally hide under my desk crying because the alarm felt like someone was stabbing my eardrums with a fork. The school nurse started calling my parents saying I was having panic attacks during normal school activities. My mom took me to our family doctor when I was 8. He did the basic hearing test where you raise your hand when you hear the beep. My hearing was perfect, so he said I probably had anxiety. That's when the real nightmare started. Every little sound became torture. The microwave beeping sounded like a fire truck Siren. When my dad would start his car in the garage, I could feel the engine vibrations. In my chest, and it made me dizzy and sick. Stopped eating dinner with my family because the sound of forks scraping plates made me want to scream. My parents were getting frustrated with me. My mom would say stuff like, normal people don't get panic attacks from the dishwasher running. My dad thought I was making it up for attention. They sent me to a counselor who gave me breathing exercises and told me to download meditation apps. By the time I turned 14, I couldn't function anymore. I stopped riding in cars because the engine noise made me nauseous. Flowers hurt my ears so bad, I could only take them for, like, two minutes. I couldn't go to restaurants because the sound of people talking mixed with plates clinking. Sounded like metal scraping against metal. One day during sophomore year, we had a fire drill, and I completely lost it. I collapsed in the hallway, sobbing and shaking. Sound was so overwhelming, I thought my head was going to explode. Three teachers had to carry me to the nurse's office. Most of my teachers thought I was being overdramatic, but my substitute science teacher, Mrs. Lopez

I discovered my wife was cheating when the kids mentioned Uncle Steve have been helping Mommy feel better at night. The betrayal hurt worse than anything I'd ever felt, but I knew staying would destroy me, so I filed for divorce. During the proceedings, I practically begged her to be reasonable about custody, look me in the eyes and said I would never keep your children from you. For six months, she actually kept her word and we fell into this decent routine where we'd exchange the kids every Friday without any drama. She'd even text me little updates about their school days and we managed to sit together at their soccer games like normal divorced parents. But then I pulled up for my regular Friday pickup and there was a for sale sign in the yard and the house was completely empty. I actually fell to my knees on their lawn because I knew she'd done it. She'd actually taken my kids. I called her phone over and over, but it just rang. When I gave up, I noticed the notification for a voicemail that came at 6:00am. Her voice was casual, saying we've relocated to Seattle for Steve's job and the kids are already enrolled in school. Like she was telling me about changing their soccer practice time. I sat in that driveway for an hour dissociating because she'd been planning on moving 3,000 miles away. For months, while looking me in the eye every Friday, The next morning, a process server handed me court papers claiming I was an absent father who prioritized work over my children. And I realized she'd also been documenting my business trips, kept calling and texting, begging to just hear my kids voices. It actually took three days for me to get through to her. She answered. And instead of explaining anything, she offered monthly video calls, like she was being generous.

The parents gave me a horrifying set of rules. I thought I hit the Jackpot when the Morrison family offered me $300 to babysit their daughter for one night. I had no idea this would be the last normal day of my life. The job seemed perfect. Rich neighborhood, well behaved kid, easy money. What could go wrong? Everything, apparently. I arrived at their mansion on Elm Street. Mrs. Morrison answered the door, looking absolutely exhausted, dark circles under her eyes, hands shaking slightly as she spoke. Thank god you're here, Riley, she said, practically pulling me inside. We haven't had a night out in months. Mr. Morrison came downstairs carrying their seven year old daughter, Sophie. The little girl was adorable, with curly blonde hair and big blue eyes. But something felt off. She didn't smile when she saw me. She just stared. Before we leave, Mrs. Morrison said, handing me several folded papers, these are very important instructions. Please follow them exactly. Sophie's special. I nodded, stuffing the papers in my pocket without reading them. Mistake. They left in a hurry, practically running to their car. I should have known something was wrong when they didn't even say goodbye to Sophie. The first few hours went great. Sophie and I watched cartoons, played board games, ate pizza. She was sweet and polite, nothing like the weird, difficult kids I usually dealt with. Around 7:30 she yawned and said she was getting tired. What time is Your bedtime? I asked. Mommy says I have to be in my room with the door locked by eight PM, she said. Matter of factly lock. That seemed weird, but rich parents had strange rules sometimes. I figured I'd check the instructions once I got her settled. I tucked Sophie into her bed at 7:55. As I was leaving, she grabbed my arm. Don't forget to lock the door, she whispered urgently. And whatever you hear tonight, don't come back in here. Promise me. Why would I need to? Promise me, she said, her grip tightening. Okay, okay. I promise. I closed her door and noticed the heavy duty lock installed on the outside. Not a regular bedroom lock, this was the kind they used in psychiatric hospitals. My hands were shaking as I turned the key. Downstairs. I finally pulled out Missus Morrison's instruction. What I read made my blood turn to ice. Dear Riley, thank you for watching Sophie tonight. She is not like other children. At exactly eight fifteen PM, you will hear scratching coming from her room. This is normal. Do not unlock her door no matter what you hear. At eight thirty PM

I'm a shuttle driver and we have this tiny break room where all 20 of us take lunch at the same time. It's basically chaos every single day with everyone trying to heat up their food at once. Last month we finally got a new microwave after begging our boss for months. The old one had been broken for weeks and nobody could heat up anything. We were all excited when the new one showed up. It lasted exactly one day. Someone put metal in it, then someone else tried to heat up soup without a lid and it exploded everywhere. By the end of the first shift, the turntable was cracked and the door wouldn't close right one day, that's how long 20 drivers took to destroy a brand new microwave. Our boss said we're not allowed to use the one in the dispatch office anymore because apparently we can't be trusted and he won't buy us another one until this broken one completely dies. So now we've got one barely working microwave for 20 people who all need to eat in a 30 minute lunch break. I was spending half my lunch standing in line just to heat up my food. By the time I got to eat, I'd have like 10 minutes before I had to get back in my shuttle. I'd be finishing my lunch while driving, which is not safe and definitely Not allowed. So I asked around if anyone wanted to split the cost of a second microwave with me. I asked at least 10 different people. Every single one said no, they didn't want to spend the money. Some said it wasn't their problem. Others said the company should provide it. Fine. I went to target and bought my own microwave for 40 bucks, brought it in the next day and set it up on the counter in the corner. I also bought a bike lock and wrapped it through the handle so nobody could walk.

My first week at McDonald's, I kept having to tell customers our ice cream machine was broken. So I did what nobody else would. Their faces would drop every single time, especially the kids who just wanted a cone or Mcflurry after their Happy Meal. It had been broken for two months according to my co workers who just drugged and said that's how it always was. I used to fix equipment at my uncle's restaurant all the time, fryers and drink machines and even some refrigeration units. So when it was slow on a Tuesday afternoon, I decide I needed to take a look at the ice cream machine. The manager Karen was off that day and the shift supervisor told me to go for it if I thought I could help. The machine wasn't that complicated once I got the panels off. The main issue was a clogged valve and some sensors that needed cleaning. Years of dried milk product had gunked up the works. I spent 3 hours taking it apart piece by piece and cleaning everything with the approved sanitizer. My coworkers started gathering around as I worked. Billy who had been there five years said she'd never seen anyone even try to fix it. Jason started taking bets on whether I'd get it working. Even some customers at the counter were watching and cheering beyond like I was performing surgery when I finally got everything back. Together and hit the power button. The machine hummed to life. The display showed all green lights for the first time in months. I ran a test patch and out came perfect soft serve vanilla ice cream. The whole crew erupted in cheers and applause. Words spread fast through the restaurant. Customers who had been turned away earlier came back for ice cream. We sold more cones and Mcflur freeze in two hours than the store usually sold in a week. Everyone was so happy. Kids were getting their desserts and employees didn't have to deal with disappointed customers anymore. I felt like a hero, honestly. My co workers kept patting me on the back and saying I should get a raise. One older lady bought an extra cone just to thank me for fixing it. The shift supervisor even let me take an extra break as a reward. I went home that night feeling proud of taking initiative and solving a problem that had been plaguing the store. The next morning, I walked in to find Karen waiting for me in the office. He had this look on her face like I'd burned down the building. Before I could even clock in, she handed me a termination notice dated two weeks out. I stood there confused, trying to understand what I was reading. You tampered with the ice cream machine, she said in this cold voice. I tried explaining that I fixed it and customers were happy and we Were selling ice cream again. She cut me off and pulled out this thick manual. Turns out McDonald's doesn't actually own those Taylor ice cream machines. They leased them from the manufacturer with a strict contract that says only certified tailor technicians can do any repairs or maintenance. By fixing it myself, I had violated the lease agreement and potentially voided the warranty. Corporate could find the franchise owner thousands of dollars. There were insurance, liability issues if someone got sick from ice cream made by a machine machine repaired by a non certified person. It didn't matter that I'd done everything correctly and the machine was working perfectly. My coworkers tried to defend me. Kaylee told Karen I was just trying to help. Jason explained how much money we'd made in ice cream sales. Even some regular customers asked why the kid who fixed the machine was getting fired. Karen wouldn't budge. Rules were rules and I'd broken a big one. She made me work those final two weeks, which was awkward for everyone. The ice cream machine kept working perfectly the whole time, which somehow made it worse. Every cone we sold reminded everyone that I was getting fired for doing something helpful. On my last day, the crew pooled together and bought me a card and a gift certificate to Burger King as a joke. Except it wasn't really a joke because I actually did apply at the Burger King down the street. During my interview, I Told the manager why I'd been let go from McDonald's.

In my family, we had something called Foundation Day every year on March 22nd. It wasn't like other family traditions. With photo albums and fond memories. At exactly six PM, we'd all go down to the basement. No lights, no electricity, just one candle. According to dad, it was the day our ancestors founded our family homestead. After surviving a brutal winter in 1874, we honored them by recreating their hardship. Dad said our ancestors huddled in caves for warmth. So we huddled on moldy wool blankets in our basement for 18 hours straight until noon the next day. I hated every second of it. The rules were brutal. Nobody could leave the circle. We ate cold beans from cans and shared one jug of water. If you needed the bathroom, you held it. Dad said our ancestors didn't have luxuries like plumbing when they were founding our family legacy. My sister Emma always cried, but dad would stroke her hair and tell her she was honoring great, great grandma Marsh, who lost three toes to frostbite. As a kid, I was terrified. I'd sob the whole time. But dad said that was the point. You had to feel fear to appreciate being alive. Every year, he told the same stories. How the Marsh family survived when others didn't. How they stayed together in the darkness and emerged stronger. He'd count out loud sometimes 14, 15, 16. Said it was the Hours they spent in their final shelter before spring came. When I got older, I started questioning it. Why did we do this? Why were we celebrating our ancestors in such a bizarre way? I remember once at 15, my friend Jake invited me to his family family reunion, and I mentioned I couldn't go because it was almost foundation day. When I explained our basement ritual, his face went pale. Dude, that's seriously messed up, he said. That night, I couldn't sleep. Jake's reaction played on a loop in my head. That's when I started noticing things. How Mom's hands shook when she packed the beans. How our family had zero photos or documents about these supposed ancestors. When I asked to see family records for a school project, dad got angry. Said I was disrespecting our heritage. But there was fear in his eyes. Real terror. Like I threatened to burn the house down. The worst part was watching dad during foundation day. Normal dad joked around and watched Football. Foundation day, dad sat rigid in the darkness, whispering to the walls. His breathing would get shallow, and he'd clutch the candle like it might disappear. I heard him say I'm sorry over and over until his voice went hoarse. Senior year, I tried to skip it. Told them I had sat prep that couldn't be rescheduled. Dad completely lost it. Grabbed my shoulders and shook me. You don't understand what happens if we break the chain. He said his eyes looked terrified. 18 hours. That's what we owe. That's what I owe. Mom pulled him off me, but I could see she was crying. Not angry tears. Scared tear. The kind that made my stomach drop. I went down to the basement anyway because dad looked so broken. Still, the obsession haunted me. Who were these Marsh ancestors, really? Why all the secrecy? Last year, I got the courage to do real research. I went to the library and searched genealogy records. Nothing about a Marsh family founding anything in 1874. Nothing about cave survivors. I was about to give up when I tried.

I made $130,000 a year as an engineer while she worked part time at a flower shop for minimum wage. I paid for everything, mortgage bills, groceries, her car insurance, everything. Never complained because that's what partners do. But the gifts she gave me were insulting. For my 30th birthday, she gave me a pair of socks from the dollar store. They still had the clearance sticker on them, 99 cents. I thought you needed socks, he said. Meanwhile, for her sister's birthday that same month, she bought a designer purse that cost $800, used my credit card for it. Lisa really wanted this specific bag, she explained.

I never said pine was my favorite anything. Christmas was the worst. She give me things like expired candy she found in the back of the pantry wrapped in newspaper.

My girlfriend Bianca is a model. I'm an accountant. When she agreed to a second date, my brother literally asked if I was paying her. Eight months in, everything was perfect. She was funny, spontaneous. Literally everything a man dreams of. We'd stay up talking until 3:00am. She'd surprise me at work with lunch. Made me feel like I was the only guy in the world. Then I moved into her place. Little things started changing. The way she'd phrase questions that weren't really questions. How her suggestions felt less like suggestions. Still perfect on the surface, but the way she looked at me was different. In Christmas morning. Changed everything. We're opening gifts in bed, and she hands me this perfectly wrapped box with a huge smile. Inside is a leather looking dog collar with Bianca's engraved on a silver tag. We both burst out laughing. For when you're being a bad boy, she joked. Sing me. I tossed the gag gift in the closet with the ugly sweater my mom sent. A week later, she's making dinner when she brings it up. You never wear my gift. Her voice is flat and serious. I laugh, thinking she's joking, but she's not. I put thought into that. You obviously don't care about what I give you. She locks herself in the bedroom. Two hours of silence. I knock on the door, she screams, just admit you Don't love me. After hours of me waiting outside the bathroom, she comes out, eyes red. You really thought my gift was a joke? I wore it that night just to make her happy. The smile that spread across her face was worth the weirdness. Good boy, she said, running her fingers along the leather. Something in her tone made my stomach turn. But she was happy again, affectionate again. That's all that mattered. Next day, I get home from work and she immediately freezes. Where's your collar? Like asking where my watch was. I laugh it off, thinking she's joking, but he's genuinely upset. You only wear it when I force you. That's what I mean to you. The guilt hits different when someone you love thinks you don't care. So I put it on. It becomes routine. Walk in, collar on. Small price for peace.

Nothing dramatic, just six months of hand holding and awkward first kisses before we mutually decided we were better as friends. No hard feelings, no drama. We'd even joke about it sometimes. But then she started dating Shay, this varsity wrestler with a muscular build and huge ego. I remember the exact moment everything changed. I was at my locker when I heard his voice behind me. What's up, buddy? The way he said it, dripping with this weird aggression, made my stomach drop. Before I could turn around, his fist connected with my chest so hard, I slammed back into the lockers. Later, I found out he'd been scrolling through Thalia's Instagram and found our old couple photos. Apparently, his brain couldn't process that his girlfriend had dated someone who chose books over the gym. The thing was, it became came this sick ritual. Every single day, same performance. What's up, squirt? Followed by a chest punch that left bruises I'd examine in the bathroom mirror at night. Purple and green patches spreading across my ribs like watercolors. At first, thali, they would tell him to stop, but he just laugh and say we were just playing around. Eventually, she stopped saying anything at all. She just look away. And somehow that hurt. Worse than the punches. Everyone knew why he did it. I'd catch the whispers, that's Thalia's ex. Whenever it happened. My friends kept saying to just avoid them, but we were in all in the same friend circles. Same classes, same everything. The breaking point came on a Tuesday. Thalia and I got paired for Chemistry Lab, and for 20 minutes, it was like old times. We were laughing about Mister Telford's toupee shifting when he got excited about covalent bonds. Just innocent, stupid stuff. But Shay saw us from across the cafeteria, and I watched his face go dark. He didn't even say his usual line. He just walked over. And by the look in his eyes, I knew this was going to be different. The punch that landed on my lanky, malnourished self knocked the wind out of me completely. I was on the ground, wheezing, making these pathetic gasping sounds while everyone stared. Thalia stood there, frozen between helping me and standing by him. And she chose him. Of course she did. I walked home instead of going to class. And with each step, something inside me shifted. I was done being the victim.

You adopted them over six weeks. Our limit is two per household. I don't have cats. Thursday, my landlord knocked on my door. The other tenants are complaining the animals, the noise, the smell coming from your unit. I don't have any animals. He pushed past me, looked around my apartment, empty, clean. No animals anywhere. Where are they? There are no animals. Multiple shelters confirmed you adopted dozens. Where are you keeping them? Friday, the ASPCA called. We're investigating animal hoarding. Your address is flagged. I'm not hoarding animals. 23 dogs, 17 cats, 4 rabbits, 2 parrots, all adopted in three months. Using your information. Someone's using my identity. Saturday, elder started calling. You need to bring the animals back for welfare checks. I drove to the nearest shelter, demanded to see my adoption records. They showed me applications filled out with my information, photos of me with Animals. Home inspection reports of my apartment. This isn't my handwriting. We verified your ID. We visited your home. Show me the home inspection photos. They pulled them up. My apartment, but it looked different. Filled with dog crates, cat trees, litter boxes everywhere. That's not my apartment.

I just been promoted to VIKI and I wanted to enjoy some Italian wine with my family to celebrate. At ten PM, I heard it, an aggressive knock on my door.

You know you don't deserve it, right? You're not even qualified. I didn't say a word. I knew my family could hear us from the backyard because the walls were thin. And I knew that tonight could be the night they'd see who he really was behind closed doors. Not the golden child he painted himself out to be, but instead a selfish bully. All I had to do was make sure he confessed to everything. Nothing to say? He laughed, bitter and sharp. You never knew how to defend yourself. Remember Mitch? That boyfriend you were so in love with sophomore year? Tell me what really happened. I said softly, making my voice sound weak. I already knew the answer. But when I tried to tell my family what he did, no one believed me. Now they were going to hear a confession straight from the source. You want to know why he really left you? My brother's voice got that proud edge. The one he always had when he did something cruel. I lied and told him you were cheating on him with his roommate.

It's been brutal, but we're trying. We begged our son to come to therapy with us. He's 19, in college, so we can't force him. Our therapist gave us a list of warning signs to watch for. He seemed okay, so we let him grieve his own way. Then my wife found a video not on his account. It was reposted by someone else, but it had gone viral. Over 3,000 views. Showed our daughter's school picture with the caption, before getting my driver's license, and then cut to a photo of her gravestone next to the totaled car. The comments were disgusting. People making jokes about her death, laughing at it. My wife couldn't breathe. He found his actual account. After that, there were five videos total. One showed a baby photo of him and our daughter side by side, then cut to a selfie of him next to her hospital bed before she died. The caption said, us then versus now. Another one had her smiling at her birthday party, then showed the funeral flowers. Every single video Had hundreds of comments. People were laughing, making puns about car accidents, saying she deserved it for being a bad driver. My wife started hyperventilating so bad, I had to take her to the emergency room. They gave her fluids. Dated her because she couldn't stop vomiting. I stayed with her for four hours until she could calm down enough to go home. When we got back, I went straight to his room.

Within hours, my mother in law and sister in law started calling me. They were furious. They said I broke Matthew's heart with what I said and that I needed to apologize immediately. Until I did, he wasn't coming home. They told me I was being too sensitive, that all he meant was pregnancy isn't an excuse to be lazy, that he meant no harm, that I misunderstood him. I packed my bags and went to my mom and dad's house. My mom is absolutely furious with him. She told me under no circumstances am I to apologize or even speak to him without the conversation being recorded or having a witness present. She said she's seen this pattern before in her own friends'marriages and it never gets better without accountability. His family keeps calling. My phone won't stop buzzing with messages saying I'm destroying our marriage, that I'm being dramatic, that good wives support their husbands even when they make mistakes. I blocked them all. My dad asked if I wanted him to go talk to Matthew. I said no. If Matthew wants to apologize, he knows where to find me. He knows what he needs to say. Last night, Matthew's mom showed up at my parents house demanding to speak with Me? My dad answered the door and told her to leave. She started crying on the porch saying, I'm tearing the family apart, that Matthew is devastated and barely eating. My mom yelled from inside, your son did that when he decided to treat his pregnant wife like a maid. Maybe you should have raised him better. She left after that. This morning, I got a text from Matthew, just one sentence. Can we please talk? I haven't responded.

And it destroyed my entire family. It started junior year when I got a severe ear infection that left me temporarily deaf in both ears for two weeks. During those weeks, I Learned to read lips and discovered something fascinating. People say horrific things when they think you can't hear them. My hearing came back, but I didn't tell anyone. The first thing I Learned was that my best friend Sarah called me pathetic behind my back while sitting right next to me at lunch. She told Jessica how exhausting it was pretending to care about my problems. She's so needy. Sarah Mouth while I stared straight ahead. My parents were worse. At dinner, my mom would silently mouth things like, she's falling behind and everything to my dad. He'd nod and mouth back. It's probably just a phase. But the real revelation came from my sister Emma. Emma was two years older and the golden child. Straight A's, varsity soccer, early admission to Stanford. I thought we were close. I was wrong. One night, Emma brought her boyfriend over to study. I was in the living room, supposedly doing homework. I sat at the kitchen table where I could see them perfectly. Is she always this pathetic? Her boyfriend asked, gesturing toward me. Emma laughed. Pretty much. My parents baby her because she's the disappointment. Basically given up on her being successful. Like me. Doesn't that bother you? Are you kidding? It makes my life easier. They expect nothing from her. Everything from me. I kept my face neutral, but inside, I was planning my revenge. For three years, I documented everything. My parents had a betting pool with relatives about whether I'd graduate high school. My guidance counselor told colleagues I was a lost cause. Even my grandmother told my mom she was embarrassed to introduce me to her bridge club. The breaking point came at Emma's graduation party. The whole extended family was there, celebrating her acceptance to medical school. I sat in the corner playing the part of the disabled sister. That's when I overheard my parents talking to my uncle.

We don't have to worry about her future anymore. They were planning to abandon me financially because they thought I was disabled. I stood up, walked to the center of the room, and clapped my hands loudly. Can everyone hear that? I asked. Clearly. The room went silent. Emma's face went white. Because I can hear everything, I continued. Every cruel word, every whispered insult, every plan you've made behind my back for three years. My mother's mouth fell open. What do you mean? I mean, I've been able to hear perfectly since junior year. I just wanted to see what kind of people my family really were when they thought I couldn't hear them. I pulled out my phone and played a recording. My parents discussing how much money they'd save by not sending the defective one to college. Emma started crying. We didn't mean. Yes, you did. I cut her off. I turned to my parents. You raised me for 18 years, then wrote me off the moment you thought I had a disability. I picked up my graduation gift, a cheap bracelet they'd clearly grabbed last minute, and handed it back to my mom. Keep this. You'll need to save money now that you only have one Daughter I walked out and never went back. Five years later, I'm finishing my master's degree in psychology. Emma dropped out of medical school after two years. Turns out she couldn't handle pressure without her parents doing everything for her. They've tried reaching out, claiming they misunderstood what I heard. But I have three years of recordings that say otherwise. Sometimes people ask if I regret the deception. The answer is simple. I regret that it was necessary. But I Learned the most valuable lesson of my life. When people show you who they really are, believe them, even when they think you can't hear them.

My girlfriend Bianca is a model. I'm an accountant. When she agreed to a second date, my brother literally asked if I was paying her. Eight months in, everything was perfect. She was funny, spontaneous. Literally everything a man dreams of. We'd stay up talking until 3:00am. She'd surprise me at work with lunch. Made me feel like I was the only guy in the world. Then I moved into her place. Little things started changing. The way she'd phrase questions that weren't really questions. How her suggestions felt less like suggestions. Still perfect on the surface, but the way she looked at me was different. Then Christmas morning changed everything. We're opening gifts in bed and she hands me this perfectly wrapped box with a huge smile. Inside is a leather looking dog collar with biancas engraved on a silver tag. We both burst out laughing. For when you're being a bad boy, she joked, kissing me. I tossed the gag gift in the closet with the ugly sweater my mom sent. A week later, she's making dinner when she brings it up. You never wear my gift. Her voice is flat and serious. I laugh, thinking she's joking, but she's not. I put thought into that. You obviously don't care about what I give you. She locks herself in the bedroom. Two hours of silence. I knock on the door, she screams, just admit You don't love me. After hours of me waiting outside the bathroom, she comes out, eyes red. You really thought my gift was a joke? I wore it that night just to make her happy. The smile that spread across her face was worth the weirdness. Boy, she said, running her fingers along the leather. Something in her tone made my stomach turn. But she was happy again, affectionate again. That's all that mattered. Next day, I get home from work and she immediately freezes. Where's your collar? Like asking where my watch was. I laugh it off, thinking she's joking, but she's genuinely upset. You only wear it when I force you. That's what I mean to you. The guilt hits different when someone you love thinks you don't care. So I put it on. Comes routine walk in, collar on. Small price for peace. I thought it would only be a temporary thing that she would forget about after a few weeks. Then two weeks in, she starts saying good boy constantly. When I'd bring her coffee, when I'd agree with her, when I'd put the collar on without being asked, I mention it. Feels weird. It's just cute. She says. Don't you wanna be my good boy? The way she asks make saying no feel like saying I don't love her. Then the commands start. I'm heading to the kitchen for dinner. Sit, she says from the couch. I freeze. What? Sit here next to me. Her Tone is playful, but her eyes aren't. I sit confused. Good boy. My skin crawls. Later. I'm making my plate. Did I say you could eat yet? She's not joking. Beg for it. I laugh nervously. She doesn't. I'm serious. Beg or don't eat. I stand there, played in hand, calculating if this is the hill to die on. My. My growls. Please can I eat? She smiles. Good boy. I start documenting everything in my phone. The commands get worse. Stay when I try to leave arguments. Speak when she wants me to agree with her. Quiet when I'm winning a discussion. She uses them strategically. Always. When I'm too tired or hungry to fight back, her friends come over for wine night. I'm getting drinks from the kitchen. Look how well trained he is.

I hooked up with all of them at different times, sometimes together. It was a phase. Nothing emotional, just young and stupid. That stopped years ago when we all grew up. Two of them are now in serious relationships with two of my best friends. Everyone knows the history, and we moved past it. Or so I thought. My boyfriend Liam and I have been together a year, and it's been the best relationship of my life. We clicked instantly, and I knew within weeks this man was endgame material. The only issue is I'm his first serious girlfriend, so he gets insecure sometimes, especially knowing about my past. I've been completely honest with him about my history with these guys. I told him it meant nothing, that it's ancient history and he's all I want now. He said he understood and trusted me. I even asked my guy friends privately to never bring it up out of respect. Last Saturday, we're all hanging out at my place. It's me, Liam, my three guy friends, and my two best friends. Normal night, everyone's drinking and playing cards. Around ten PM, I head out with one of my girlfriends to grab more beer and snacks from The store. We're gone maybe 20 minutes. When I walk back in with the groceries, Liam's entire energy has shifted. He's sitting on the couch staring at his phone, won't make eye contact. The guys are laughing about something. I can tell immediately something's wrong. You okay, babe? I ask him. He forces a smile and says, yeah, I'm good. But I know him. He's not good. We stay another hour, but he barely talks. When we finally leave and get in my car, he's silent. I drive us back to my apartment, and the second we're inside, I press him. Liam, what happened? You were fine before I left. He sits on my couch and his jaw clenches. Friends wouldn't shut up about being Eskimo brothers. They kept making jokes about how I got the leftovers and asking if one guy is another you after you've had all three of them. My blood went cold. They said what? They kept saying things like welcome to the club and asking if I could satisfy you the same way they couldn't. Saying, at least now you've settled down with just one guy. I felt sick. These were supposed to be my friends. Liam, I'm so sorry. I'll talk to them. They said you told them I was insecure about your past. Is that true? My stomach dropped. I had told them a few weeks ago in confidence that Liam sometimes felt inadequate. I thought they were my friends who I could Trust I. I did mention

Is Daisy Williams present in school today? My teacher, Missus Harra, clicked the intercom button. Yes. The principal's voice echoed, lockdown, now! This is not a drill. The way he said it made my blood freeze. Missus Harra shrieked under the desks. Lights off! Move, move, move! Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. I couldn't help but think he was after me. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Missus Harra tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. The screaming got louder, and it wasn't just one voice anymore. Multiple people in different parts of the building. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that the shooter was right outside. And I believed them. Pia grabbed my hand, and her palms were soaked with sweat. I could see Mister Kids class across the hall through our door window. Lights already off. No movement. Just darkness. Where 20 kids should have been. I looked at our teacher, and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids, and told us it would be okay. But after a while, She got up again and walked back to her laptop. Then we heard it. Footsteps running past our door. Thud! Thud, thud! I couldn't help myself. I had to look. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall, pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops. Get away from the door, Daisy! Missus Harra whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Even missus Harra stood up slowly and crept to the door to check the window before opening it. That's when it flung open. The principal stood there with an actual cop who had his hand resting on his gun. You, Daisy, come with us. Immediately my worst fear confirmed. The sugar had sent them. Or maybe they thought I was involved somehow. Missus Harra looked between them and me, confused. Get your things, honey, missus Harra said. And that scared me more than anything, because in three years of chemistry class, she'd never called me honey. Every single person was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack with shaking hands. Hallway was complete chaos, more cops than I'd ever seen. In one place, I heard a paramedic shout, we're losing him! Move! As he flew past us. My classmates were pressed against the door windows in every room, watching me get escorted by police like I was a criminal. They steered me to the main office, but passed reception into the Conference room. The cop finally spoke. Your dad is here? Well, my parents are divorced, and I hadn't seen him since I was seven. So now I was really confused. Dad? He grabbed me in a hug so tight, I couldn't breathe, and his whole body shook against mine. I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. My ex marine father, who always encouraged me to be stoic and suppress my feelings, was crying his eyes out. Sorry for what? What's happening? Is there a shooter? Are people dead? I pulled back to look at him, and he held my face in both hands. His hands were freezing. There's no

I'm getting married next summer. When Jason proposed, I thought it would be nice to ask his niece Avery, to be a bridesmaid. She's 15 and the only kid on either side of our families. We only met twice before, but she seemed pretty cool and I figured it might help us get to know each other better. Fast forward to three weeks ago, we drove to Jason's hometown to visit his family and talk wedding stuff. His brother Greg. Greg's wife Monica and Avery came over to his parents house. Second I saw Avery, I noticed something different. She was wearing baggy cargo pants, an oversized hoodie, and her hair was pulled back in a messy bun, way more casual than the last time I'd seen her in a floral sundress. We sat in the living room drinking coffee and Jason's mom brought out wedding magazines. She started flipping through pages of bridesmaid dresses, pointing at the puffy ones and the sparkly ones. Avery shifted in her seat. Her shoulders got tense. She stopped making eye contact with anyone. Monica noticed, oh, we'll have to take you shopping soon, honey. Get you something pretty and feminine. For once, she laughed like it was a joke. But Avery's face went red. Jason's mom chimed in, yes, and maybe we can do something with your hair. A nice updo would look so lovely. Greg nodded. It'll be good for you to dress up. You're at that age where you should be presenting yourself better. I watched Avery sink deeper into the couch. She pulled her hoodie sleeves over her hands. Then Monica said it. It'll be nice to see you dressed like a girl for once. My stomach dropped. I was a total tomboy growing up, hated dresses, hated makeup. My aunt used to say things exactly like that to me at every family gathering and it crushed me every single time. I still remember hiding in the bathroom at my cousin's wedding because she kept making comments about how I looked like a boy. I didn't even think. I just reacted. Hey, Avery, I forgot to tell you something important about the wedding. Everyone looked at me. My best friend Kelsey is my maid of honor and she's wearing a suit, like a full tailored suit with pants. I told all my bridesmaids they can wear whatever they want as long as it's in our wedding color, which is dark green. Avery's head snapped up. Really? Yeah, absolutely. Hold on. I pulled out my phone and opened the folder where Kelsey had sent me outfit ideas. I scooted closer to Avery on the couch and started showing her photos. A green jumpsuit, wide leg pants with a nice blouse, blazer and trouser combo, a tuxedo jacket with tailored slacks. You can pick any of these. Or honestly, if you want to wear Jeans and a green sweater. That works, too. It's a wedding, not a runway show. I just want everyone comfortable and having fun. Avery's whole face changed. She actually smiled. You're serious? Completely serious. You could wear sneakers if you want. I don't care. The room went dead quiet. Monica.

So I started calling her after her husband's mistress. My sister in law, Courtney, has called me Jennifer for three years, even though my name is Lisa, because that's my husband David's ex girlfriend's name. And she does it on purpose to remind everyone I'm the replacement. Started at our wedding. The priest said, do you, David, take Lisa? And from the family section, Courtney shouted, don't you mean Jennifer? People laughed nervously. David told her to stop. She said it was a slip of the tongue, but winked at Jennifer's friends, who she'd invited without telling us. During our first dance, Courtney loudly told her table how David and Jennifer used to dance to the same song. It wasn't true. David had never danced to our wedding song with anyone else. But Courtney kept going, telling made up stories about David and Jennifer's perfect relationship until David's father told her to shut up. At the gift opening, every card from Courtney was addressed to David and Jennifer. When I thanked her for the blender, she said, oh, Jennifer would have loved that. She loves smoothies. I said, my name is Lisa. She said, right. Sorry. You just remind me so much of her. I look nothing like Jennifer. Short, blonde and pale. Jennifer was tall, brunette, and tan. The only thing we had in common was David and Jennifer had Cheated on him with his best friend, which is why they broke up. But Kourtney rewrote history to make Jennifer the victim. Christmas that year, Kourtney brought Jennifer to dinner. Actually brought her. Said she was alone for the holidays and needed family. David's mother was horrified, but too polite to make a scene. Courtney introduced me to Jennifer as David's new Jennifer, then laughed like it was hilarious. Jennifer looked uncomfortable and left after an hour, but the damage was done. Every family event after that, Courtney would ask if Jennifer was coming. She's practically family, she'd say. Unlike some people who just married in. Three years of this. Three years of being called Jennifer at every gathering. Three years of Kourtney tagging me as Jennifer on social media, then claiming autocorrect. Three years of her telling people she can't remember my real name because Jennifer was so memorable. David told her to stop hundreds of times. His parents told her it was disrespectful. She'd apologize, then do it again immediately. Old habits, she'd say. Jennifer was around for so long. They dated for two years. We've been married for three. Last month was Courtney's 10th anniversary party. Big, fancy event at a hotel, 200 guests. I helped planet despite everything, because David asked me to be the bigger person. Always the bigger person, never Courtney. During the slideshow of Courtney and her husband Paul's relationship, I noticed something. A woman in several old photos who wasn't Courtney pretty Brunette laughing with Paul holding his hand. I asked David's aunt who it was. Oh, that's Elizabeth, Paul's ex. They were engaged before he met Courtney. She left him for someone else, but Paul was destroyed. Interesting. Party continued and Courtney stood to give a toast. Started talking about true love, soulmates, finding the right person. Then said, I want to thank everyone for coming, especially David and Jennifer. The room went quiet. David stood up, but I

I was chilling on my bed with my roommate when I got a Snapchat ad from Quick Add. His name was Connor and I was bored. So I added him back because why not? In our first convo, he was super chill and talked about normal stuff, relationships, family dramas, stuff like that. That's when he asked how old I was. My roommate Audrey grabbed my phone and started typing for me, oh, I'm actually 15. How old are you? And I was dying laughing because at the time I was really 21. But when we saw his response, our laughter died in our throats. He said, oh, wow, that's young. I'm 28, but I hope we can keep talking. You seem really mature and I'm sure you're really cute. Lol, heart emoji. Me and Audrey just stared at each other. Was this man for real? He was using all the classic signs of grooming, not even trying to hide it. I should have blocked him right there. something made me curious about how far this creep would actually go. So me and Audrey responded with, thanks, Poppy, and laughed. Over the next few days, Connor kept messaging me these weird compliments about how I was different from other girls my age and how he wished he could help take care of me. Then one night after we've been playing those stupid Snapchat Games for like three hours straight. He sent me something that changed everything. $100, the message said, for being so sweet and making my nights less lonely. I stared at my phone screen and screenshotted it for Audrey, $100 for literally just sending Snapchats back and forth. Audrey replied saying, milk him dry. The moral part of my brain was screaming at me saying this wasn't the right thing to do. But the other side of me, the broke college student who didn't want to work at the campus coffee shop anymore, wanted more from him. That's when Connor sent something else that made my skin crawl, his home and work addresses. I want you to know you can trust me, baby girl, he wrote. See, I'm being totally open with you. I screenshotted everything. Immediately this weird feeling in my stomach telling me I need this later. From there, every Friday, Connor would send me $500. It literally became my new favourite day of the week, lol. Sometimes he'd send more if I sent special pictures, which were literally just random photos of hands and feet I found on Pinterest. I created this whole fake life for him. Strict parents who checked my phone, volleyball practice after school, honor roll stress. The lies came so easily it scared me. He ate it all up, calling me his little one and telling me how I was so mature for 15, t, b, h, I didn't care as long as I Got paid, I'd be whatever age he wanted me to be. The way I saw it, I was stealing from someone who deserved it, like Robin Hood, if Robin Hood was a baddie. Because the money was being used for good. I caught up on 3 months of rent for my parents and my mom called crying about her medical bills. I transferred her $1,000 and she didn't need to go into more debt. But Connor kept pushing for more. The messages got more desperate, more graphic about what he wanted to see, what he wanted to do when we finally meet. Then last Friday happened. I woke up and checked my cash app like I always did. But instead of seeing my usual bread, there was nothing. For a second, my heart actually broke. Then I snapped out of it. Was I to continue? Tap the arrow in the bottom right corner and copy the link. Then tap the CapCut icon in the bottom left. Finally click the red button. Three days later, my phone blew up. It was mom first, a bunch of text.

My husband Eric had always been a jokester and it's one of the things I fell in love with. But over the years, the jokes became meaner. He started calling me his old ball and chain. When his buddies were around, he pat my stomach and say, expanding again this year or tell his co workers how some people age like fine wine and how unfortunately I was aging like cheese. Laugh. But their faces would always look just as uncomfortable as mine. Then last week during my birthday dinner with his parents, Eric raised his glass and stood up to toast me to my beautiful wife, he said. And for a second my heart lifted. Then he grinned and added, my adorably ugly old lady, happy birthday. Here's to another year. Only a few more until I get to collect that life insurance policy. Everyone at the table laughed nervously. I felt my heart sink in disappointment. You know, your joke really went too far this time. I told him in the car later, actually, all of your jokes lately have been nothing but mean and I don't appreciate it. I thought back to yours as I explained how much his words hurt, how every joke chipped away at my confidence, how I didn't recognize myself anymore because I started to believe the things he said about me. He pulled up on the side of the road and stared at me for a long moment before saying, babe, are you serious being dramatic over nothing? It was just light teasing. You know me, but I've also been telling you for weeks how much I didn't like your jokes. I said quietly, well, it's not like they're lies. You are getting older and it doesn't help that you've been letting yourself go ever since we had kids. Can't you just do what most people do and let it go and one ear and out the other, he suggested. That's when I realized he'd never understand, not unless he felt it himself. The next morning, I opened up about the situation to our family and friends. His sister stayed quiet for a long time before admitting, I've been watching him do this to you for years. You deserve better and we'll help him see that. She started it off casually the next time she met with my husband. Hey, Eric, I noticed your hair has been thinning. Don't worry, bald is attractive on some people, she said. I watched Eric touch his head, forcing his smile. Then during his golf game, Eric's best friend called him his little punching bag, mentioning how hard it was constantly beating him in each match. This time, Eric got annoyed and told him to back off. His friend just grinned and patted his back. Come on, man. Learn to take a joke. Eric's mom Also made comments over dinner. Eric, Honey, are those new pants, they make you look a little frumpy. Maybe you should hit the gym more. She said it so sweetly that he couldn't argue. Even his co workers had joined him, calling him Mr Mediocre in meetings, making jokes about his boring presentations. One guy even patted his shoulder and said in that same sarcastic tone Eric always used on me, don't worry, buddy, not everyone can be a star. By the end of the week, Eric was coming home looking more defeated each day. He checked himself in the mirror constantly, justing his shirt or running his hand over his thinning hair. He stopped making jokes entirely. Then last night he came home and collapsed onto the couch next to me. He put his head in his hands and just sat there for a long moment. I don't know what's happening, he finally said. It's like everyone's turned against me. My best friend thinks I'm a punching bag. My coworkers think I'm mediocre and boring. Even my own mother thinks I terrible. His voice cracked. And my boss, the one person whose opinion actually mattered to me, called me his adorable little slacker in front of my whole team today. I've never felt so humiliated. He looked at me with genuine pain in his eyes. I feel like I'm not good enough at anything anymore. Like I'm just this pathetic, balding, frumpy guy I who peaked years ago and Everyone can see it but me. I sat there listening to him list every single insecurity that had been planted in him over the past week, the same insecurities he'd been planting in me for years, the same words, the same tone, the same crushing weight of being torn down by the people.

The question caught me off guard. I. What? What did you think when you saw my profile? He was studying my face intently. Before the accident. I felt heat rising to my cheeks. I don't know what you want me to say. The truth, he said. Simply because I've been sitting here since Saturday trying to figure out what to do about the situation, and I need to know if this was really just an accident, or if maybe, possibly some part of you meant to right. Anyway, the office suddenly felt airless. That's Connor. You're my boss. I'm aware, he said, leaning back in his chair. I'm very, very aware. Which is why I've been driving myself insane all weekend. He ran his fingers through his hair, clearly frustrated at the situation I caused. When I saw your profile, I couldn't swipe right. He swallowed like it pained him. Because I'm your boss would be inappropriate. It could ruin both our careers. But you super liked me. And for About 10 seconds. I thought maybe the universe was giving me permission, until I realized it was probably an accident. He stood up and walked back to the window. Was this real? Was he saying what I thought he was saying? But I need to know, Eloise. Was any part of it real? Or was it completely an accident? I stood up too, my legs shaky. I took a leap of faith. If you weren't my boss, I said slowly, I would have super liked you on purpose. I would have swiped right immediately. But you are my boss. So, yes, it was an accident. My thumb slipped because I was nervous seeing you there, and I was holding my phone too tight. He turned to look at me, something changing in his expression. Hope. I'm leaving the company, he said suddenly. What? I got an offer from another company two weeks ago. I accepted it Friday. My last day here is March 15th. The room spun slightly. You're leaving? He nodded. Which means in three weeks, I won't be your boss anymore. The weight of what he was saying settled over the room. He wasn't my boss for much longer. So would you let me take you to dinner on March 16th? Yes, I said.

She said we couldn't have a relationship with her if we didn't accept one with her husband. My dad died when I was 10. My sister was 12. Five years later, mom married Frank and our lives turned into a nightmare. Frank had two rules he lived by. First one was simple. Nobody could mention dad around him ever. Didn't matter if we were at home or visiting Dad's family. If Frank heard Dad's name, he'd lose it. My sister mentioned dad during her high school graduation speech and Frank literally yelled at her in front of everyone at the dinner after mom just sat there. Second rule was worse. Frank had to be involved with anything related to Dad's side of the family. We couldn't just tell mom we were visiting grandma or our uncle. We had to ask Frank's permission. And nine times out of 10, he'd invite himself along. My sister and I would be sitting at our grandma's table trying to talk about dad, and Frank would clear his throat like a warning. Our own grandmother had to tiptoe around mentioning her dead son because this guy decided he owned our family. Now, when my sister turned 18 and moved out, she stopped playing along. She'd visit Dad's family whenever she wanted, and Frank would blow up her phone demanding to know why she didn't ask him first. He blocked his number. Mom called her instead, asking why she was being so Disrespectful. My sister told mom straight up, we don't want Frank in our lives. Mom said, if we can't accept him, then we can't have her either.

I turned around and me and the old man locked eyes. His hands were clasped together and he started mouthing the word please. Me and my bestie Fifi stepped back. Get the hell away from us, I said boldly. It's giving Michael Jackson. Fifi chimed in, getting ready to throw her Stanley at the old man. Suddenly, he dropped down to his knees on the sand and started rocking back and forth. Please, I didn't mean to seem weird. I just need you girls to pee on me. We were just about to start screaming for help when a lifeguard finally popped up. I spoke first. Thank goodness you came. This man is a freak. Fifi nodded. Please call the police. Get him off this beach. The lifeguard immediately crouched down to check the old man's breathing. What happened here? Did you girls beat him down? He laughed like it was a joke, but nothing about this was funny. The old man took a deep breath to speak. I, I just asked them to pee on me. The lifeguards whole face changed. He looked at the old man's face, which was now completely scrunched up as if he was in excruciating pain, then back at us with pure disgust. The disgust wasn't directed at the old man. It was directed at us. What the hell is Wrong with you 2. His voice was sharp and he acted like we just kicked a puppy. Why didn't you just do it? I felt my jaw drop. Was this lifeguard seriously taking the side of some pervert who wanted us to pee on him? Fifi grabbed my arm. Excuse me, you're mad at us. The lifeguard was already on his radio calling for paramedics while shaking his head. Unbelievable. You kids today have no compassion at all. The old man was getting worse, his breathing becoming these horrible wheezing sounds that made my stomach turn. I kept thinking about how we'd come to the beach for cute photos and now we were somehow the villains in this insane situation where a stranger wanted us to pee on him. The paramedics arrived within minutes. First one took one look at the old man and immediately started working on him. The second paramedic, a woman with gray hair, turned to us with this look of absolute disappointment. You two should be ashamed of yourselves, she said, while helping load him onto a stretcher. All he needed was for you to help him and you couldn't even do that. What happened to respecting your elders? He kept going on about how our generation was selfish while they wheeled him into the ambulance and drove to the hospital. He asked us to pee on him, I shouted, but she just shook her head like I was making excuses. Why was everyone acting like We were monsters for not peeing on a random old man. Against my better judgment, I grabbed Fifi's hand. We need to follow them to the hospital. She looked at me like I was crazy, but I had to know what was happening. We called an Uber and spent the whole ride in silence, both of us replaying the beach scene, trying to understand what we'd missed. It took an hour of sitting around and playing Pokemon Go in the waiting room before a student nurse finally came out and pointed at us. The old man from the beach is stable now, but he almost died because these two teenage girls refused to help him. Every single person in that waiting room turned to stare at us. Someone muttered, some people only care about themselves, loud enough for us to hear. I felt tears burning my eyes because nothing made sense. We didn't do anything. I finally screamed, standing up. He asked us to pee on him for free. Why would I do that? The whole world must have heard me shout because that's when a doctor appeared beside me. Are you two the girls from the beach incident? We nodded and he lowered his voice. So you really don't know what you did wrong? Fifi shook her head, no, he just asked us. Shh. The doctor interrupted. You're disturbing the whole ward. Come with me. We followed him into a room and that's when he finally explained what the Freak was going on. That man was stung by a box jellyfish. He has a thing called ammonia, which neutralizes the venom. It.

So I screwed her golden child sister and realised I dated the wrong sibling. We've been together 10 years. High school sweethearts turned into complete strangers living under the same roof. After college, everything fell apart. She refused to work, spent every single day locked in our guest room, stream to 5 viewers on Twitch making zero dollars while somehow racking up 8 900 dollars in online gambling debt that I had to help pay off. I was the only one working, paying rent, groceries, utilities, everything. And she had the audacity to complain that I work too much. We couldn't be in the same room without screaming at each other. Therapy didn't work. I knew she wanted out but couldn't leave because she was completely dependent on me. Then we lost our baby. That's when everything got worse. She blamed me, told me I wasn't a real man because my body couldn't do what it was programmed to do, said I caused the loss of her child and it was all my fault. She moved into the guest room permanently, told me she couldn't stand looking at my body anymore, that I disgusted her. I cried myself to sleep for months, felt like I wasn't good enough for anything or anyone. Three weeks ago I found out why her mood suddenly changed. She got weirdly happy out of nowhere, started getting dressed up to run errands, came Home smiling. We weren't being intimate at all. So it was obvious something was up. She left her icloud sync to the iPad. Every single text message with my best friend since kindergarten was right there. They've been sleeping together for months, making plans, talk, talking about me behind my back, laughing about how clueless I was. I felt sick. This was my first love and my closest friend both destroying me at the same time. Last weekend, she told me she was driving 3 hours to visit her dad, but her messages told the truth.

Needed a place to stay when I was 18, so my friend's mom said I could move in with them and rent a room. Everyone in the house had a tendency to go to bed early except her and I. She liked to drink. I like to game. One night I was bored and went out to the garage where she was drinking and listening to music. We b s for a while and she asked if I wanted to drink. Hell yeah, I do. After I had a couple shots of Goldschlager, she started with the oh, my neck is so stiff, I wish someone would rub it. Being a warm blooded teen with hormones and booze coursing through my veins, I jumped at the chance. She was 47 and had the body of someone in her early 20s. As I rubbed her shoulders, the strap on her nightgown kept falling down, showing a little more skin. She'd pick it up and let it fall further the next time. Each time, I'd let my hands wander a little. After a few minutes, she commented how wonderful it felt. And if I do her back, I don't think any blood was making it past my waist, so I agreed without hesitation. We went inside. She faced away from me and pulled her gown down to her waist on laid on her stomach. I rubbed her back for a while, and when I was done, I half jokingly asked if she needed the front done. She said yes, but only if I'd rub her bazookas. I couldn't get a single word out. I was stunned. She rolled over bazookas right there for me to play with. So I waited for my brain to reboot and did as I was told. After that massage, things escalated and she ended up riding me on the couch. That was the first time I made love without Protection, and I immediately saw what all the fuss was about. It happened a few more times, always started with her asking if I wanted a drink. Eventually I put an end to it because I got back with my girlfriend and I wasn't going to cheat on her. Once I stopped making love with the mom, she flipped out on me and evicted me. I wasn't able to ever tell my friend what happened while I lived there, because Xmina's mom would get nasty when they fought. In those times, nothing was sacred, whatever they could say to hurt the other. After I moved out, he called me a mother effer one night and I laughed until I was afraid I'd pass out. When I regained my composure, he asked what was so funny. I told him he wasn't a liar and told him what had happened. For 30 minutes all he could say is you're a mother.

So my sister Emma is 30 and I'm 22. Ten years ago, she had a miscarriage. And yeah, it was awful for everyone. Like the whole family was devastated. And it took her a solid two years to really get through it. We never figured out exactly why it happened, but it was a one time thing. And since then, she's had three completely healthy kids, including twins. That part of her life turned out fine. But here's the actual problem. Emma and I have never gotten along. When we were kids, she straight up hated me because she had to share our mom's attention. She also convinced herself that mom left her dad to be with mine, which like wasn't even true, but she believed it anyway. She bullied me my entire childhood. I'm talking years of making my life miserable just because I existed. She never grew out of it. The worst part is how she uses the miscarriage now. Every single time mom spends time with me or does something nice for me, Emma suddenly has a breakdown about what happened 10 years ago. Mom drops everything and runs to her every time. Earlier this year, I saved up and took mom to Paris for her birthday. It was supposed to be this special trip, just the two of us. We were having an amazing time. And then halfway through, Emma called mom crying. About the miscarriage, mom literally cut the trip short and flew home. I spent the rest of the vacation alone, wandering around Paris feeling like garbage. Then there was the time I had a really bad manic episode. Like I ended up in the hospital bed. Mom kept saying she'd come visit me. And every single time she was about to leave, Emma would call with another miscarriage crisis. Mom never made it to see me once during that entire hospital stay, not one.

Dad announces at dinner that he's getting remarried to Elise, this woman he's been dating for four months. Finally, you kids will have a real mother figure while I'm traveling for work, he says, like I haven't been raising my seven year old brother Ethan since mom died three years ago. Elise moves in the next week and immediately starts rearranging our entire house. I need to establish my authority, she tells dad while moving Mom's China to the garage. First morning I try explaining our routine. Our dog biscuit needs walking at 6:30 sharp or he'll have accidents. Ethan takes his ADHD meds with apple juice at 7. Never orange juice. It makes him sick. And he naps at four PM or he'll have meltdowns all evening. At least cuts me off. I'm the adult here now, not some 16 year old playing house. I'll determine what happens and when. Your father wants me to be a mother, not follow some child's schedule. I look at dad who's checking his phone. Listen to Elise. She knows what she's doing. She raised her own kids. Where are her kids now, I ask. That's not relevant. Elise snaps, fine. Dad leaves for his two week business trip. That afternoon. Elise announces new rules. Breakfast at 9, no more cuddling that spoiled dog and Ethan's too old for naps. Real mothers don't follow ridiculous schedules made by teenagers. Day one, Elise decides biscuit can wait until 8:00am for his walk because she needs her beauty sleep. Biscuit, a 90 pound German Shepherd with a bladder condition, destroys Elise's designer luggage collection while she's in the shower. Suitcases covered in dog urine. The smell never comes out. Day two, she gives Ethan his meds with orange juice because she forgot to buy apple juice. Projectile vomits across her laptop while she's on a zoom call with her book club. The laptop's fried. She refuses to give him a nap because second graders don't need babying. By six PM, Ethan's having a full meltdown, throwing everything he can find her grandmother's base she brought over. Shattered. Day 3, she decides our backyard pet funeral tradition is morbid and throws away Ethan's dead goldfish instead of letting us bury him. Ethan calls 9 1 1, sobbing that his stepmother is destroying evidence of murder. The police show up. Elise has to explain to three officers why she threw away a goldfish named Detective Bubbles. Week 2 gets worse. She changes Ethan's pick up time without telling the school. They called the police thinking he's been kidnapped. She feeds biscuit different food because his prescription diet is overpriced. Gets explosive diarrhea all over her new white couch she bought to modernize our living room. She tries to discipline Ethan by taking away his comfort items. He locks himself in the bathroom for six hours. The fire department has to remove the door They recognize our address from the goldfish incident. Everything under control here, the firefighter asks. Elise's eye is twitching. Children need discipline, she keeps muttering. She posts in her Facebook mommy group about demon stepchildren and someone screenshots it and sends it to dad. Day 12, everything implodes. Elise decides she knows better than Ethan's therapist and skips his appointment to take him shopping for proper clothes. Ethan has a panic attack in target and knocks over an entire display of televisions. Security reviews footage of Elise dragging him through the store while he screams, you're not my mom. They call CPS while Elise is dealing with that.

I decided to name my son Leonardo to honour my late childhood best friend who passed a couple of years ago. Everyone at the shower thought it was sweet except my sister Casey who stood up and slammed her palms on the table when she heard the name. That's my baby name. You know how much I love Leonardo DiCaprio and plan to name my baby that. We tried to tell Casey she wasn't even in a relationship, much less pregnant, but she wasn't having it. She yelled that we were traitors, then packed her things and left with an announcement. See, see you all in court. Two days later, I got a letter in the mail giving me 24 hours to relinquish the name or face consequences. My family called an emergency intervention. We all sat down with Casey and Mom's living room that evening and tried gently explaining why I wouldn't be giving up a name. Casey's face was like an angry tomato. She kept interrupting to tell me how my dead friend would understand how this has been her only dream in life ever since she was a little girl. We stood our ground and after proof to her through one of my lawyer friends that she couldn't go to court over a baby name, she ended up giving us an ultimatum. The name was hers or she'd got no contact with us. We all simultaneously pointed at the door. Her eyes went when we called the bluff and in this angry, defeated tone, she said, fine, you can have the stupid name. We thought that was it because we didn't hear from her at all for the next three months. But then my Labour Day came. I was literally giving birth when Casey burst through the door holding a teddy bear and shouting, Michael is here. Our whole family, including the nurses, looked confused. My husband Samuel asked what she meant. That's when Casey beamed and rubbed her flat stomach. I'm pregnant, too. You said I couldn't have the name because I wasn't pregnant. So I went out and became pregnant. Problem solved. We stared at her like she had five heads. Security removed her while she screamed about fairness. An hour later, I was holding my son for the first time. A nurse came in looking uncomfortable. There's been an issue with your paperwork. It says here the baby's name is Michael. My husband jumped up like a hawk. He investigated while I held Leonardo and found out the hospital documents were different from what we submitted. Casey had actually tried to officially change our baby's name while I was in active labor. The hospital fixed it, but the message was Casey was determined. The next morning, while we were still recovering, my brother called. Casey's at the hospital. She's hurt really badly. Turns out Casey had woken up at 5:00am And had been filing name claims, then driving to every courthouse in the entire state trying to get someone to legally grant her the name Leonardo. She barely slept and spent all day without eating and drinking, leading to her being so tired and dehydrated that she suffered a sunstroke before collapsing on the courthouse steps. I fell straight onto her belly and started miscarrying. She was rushed to the nearest hospital where they had to IV fluids and nutrients into her. The moment she was lucid again, she called me directly from the hospital, yelling that I called her baby by forcing her to fight for what was rightfully hers. Leonardo was mine, she sobbed. How does it feel to know an innocent baby is dead because of you? I hung up without responding. Three weeks later, I was breastfeeding when Samuel's phone rang. It was Child Protective Services. Some one had reported us for child abuse and neglect. The case worker rattled off allegations that made my blood run cold. Samuel was apparently violent towards the baby. His juvenile record from a bar fight when he was 17 was cited. My dad, who lived with us, was also mentioned as a threat. His old teaching scandal where a student accused him of inappropriate behaviour before admitting she lied was also cited. They even mentioned the house being unsafe for a Newborn. While we were still reeling from the call, my neighbour texted me screenshots from our local Facebook Casey had written this long post about making the brave decision to report abuse she'd witnessed going on in our home, painting herself as a hero saving a baby from danger. Twenty minutes later, I let the workers thinking seeing our clean house would end this nightmare. The case worker checked the nursery, the baby supplies, Leonardo sleeping peacefully. But then she saw my dad in the kitchen is the.

Then his friend called me hot. I spent a year getting stronger and training for a Marathon. I'd lost 60 pounds in the process. My boyfriend never once acknowledged it. When I mentioned hitting a new personal record at the gym, he said no one really cares about your weight loss except you. I stopped bringing it up after that. Then we went to his friend's birthday party and everything changed. I started running in January because my doctor said I needed to get my blood pressure down. My boyfriend said running was boring and he didn't understand why I'd want to embarrass myself huffing and puffing around the neighborhood where people could see me. By March, I was running 3 miles without stopping and I told him about it over dinner. He was scrolling through his phone and said, that's cool. You're still not fast, though, without looking up. I joined a gym in April and started lifting weights. My boyfriend started making comments every time I left again, you know, you're just going to end up looking bulky and gross, right? My co workers kept telling me I looked amazing. My best friend said I was glowing. My boyfriend looked me up and down one night and said, you look the same to me. Actually, you're getting kind of veiny in your arms. That's not attractive. I signed up for a 5K in July and finished in under 30 minutes. My boyfriend was playing video games when I got home and said, did you win? I said, no, there were hundreds of people running. He said, then why does it matter? I started training for longer distances every Sunday. My boyfriend got nasty about it. You're seriously going to waste another entire day sweating like a pig. One morning I couldn't find my running shoes and found them later in the back of his closet covered in dirt. He said I must have put them there and forgot. He kept saying things that cut deeper. You're obsessed and it's honestly pathetic. Your legs are getting too muscular. It's disgusting. You know, this whole fitness thing is just because you're insecure, right? I registered for a Marathon in November. My boyfriend looked at me like I was insane. A Marathon, you're not a real runner. You're going to embarrass yourself. I ran the Marathon and finished in four hours and 12 minutes. My boyfriend refused to come watch. He said, why would I stand around for four hours watching you struggle to do something you're not even good at? My best friend came instead and cried when I crossed the finish line. When I got home with my medal, he barely glanced at it and said, so that's done. Thank god. Maybe now you'll go back to being normal. Two weeks late.

I turned 10 last week and spent the whole morning standing in our living room while my dad read from this notebook where he writes down everything I do wrong. As he read each of my failures, my mom delivered the punishments for each one. January 8th, you spilled milk on the counter, he said, and my mom slapped me so hard I tasted blood. January 19th, you got a B on your spelling test. The belt came out. I had to count to 20 while she hit me. And if I lost count from crying, we started over at 1. February 5th, you forgot to make your bed and she punched me in the stomach so hard I threw up. After we got through all 67 mistakes, which took about four hours, because some punishments made me pass out, my mom brought out a birthday candle stuck in a piece of stale bread. This is your cake, because children who make mistakes don't deserve real cake. We're good parents, so we still give you a candle. They made me blow it out, but told me my wish was already decided for me. Your wish is to be worth something this year at school, Lucia came up to me at recess and said her birthday party was on Saturday and she really wanted me to come. My parents don't let me go to birthday parties. I, I told her, my mom already talked to your Mom at pickup yesterday and she said you could. When I got home, my mom confirmed it was true because they were going out that night and did not want to hire a babysitter. You will be there from 4 to 8 and not one minute longer. If I hear you did anything wrong or embarrassing, the consequences will be severe, she said while squeezing my arm. We will know if you mess up because parents always talk to each other about their kids. I spent the whole week nervous about what could go wrong and practicing how to act normal, even though I did not really know what normal meant. When I walked into Lucia's house on Saturday, music was playing, kids were laughing and nobody looked scared of anything. Made it, Lucia's mom said and gave me a hug, which was strange because adults in my house only touched kids when they were punishing them. Lucia is so excited you're here. Her dad was wearing this ridiculous cone shaped party hat and was helping kids make their own hats at the table when one kid accidentally squeezed too much glitter and it went everywhere. He just said glitter explosion and helped clean it up without punishing anyone. Then we played this game where you had to pass a present around while music played and when it stopped, you got to unwrap one layer. This kid accidentally ripped through three layers at once and Lucia's mom just laughed and Said he was really strong.

I am a 37 year old woman and I know what you're thinking when you hear that my 14 year old son showers with me. Right. Well, I have a good reason for it. We both share the same bathroom and bedroom. At first I hesitated to admit this online because of the looks and judgmental comments I would receive from strangers. But here it goes. It all started three years ago when my husband suddenly left us without any explanation. It was a complete shock. We had been married for over 15 years and he seemed happy. Until one day he packed his bags and disappeared. All he said to us was, I'm going to buy milk at the gas station. Be right back. He never came back. The kids were devastated, especially my youngest, Max. He clung to me more than ever, seeking comfort wherever he could find it. At night, Max would come into my room, shivering from the cold, begging for a warm blanket. As much as I wanted to send him back to his own room, I couldn't bear to see him so vulnerable. So gradually, Max moved closer to my side, eventually ending up sleeping beside me, sometimes even cuddled up to me. Over time, I began to notice that Max wouldn't leave my side during the day either, whether it was taking a shower or brushing His teeth. Max was always there, watching closely. I tried to ignore it, hoping he would outgrow it like most teenage behaviours. However, as days turned into weeks and then into months, I realised that this wasn't going away anytime soon. One night, while I was taking a shower, Max asked if he could join me. I asked why, and he said that all the kids at school say I have a level 9 gas. I don't know what that means, but I was shocked. At first I hesitated, unsure if it was appropriate or healthy. But looking at him, so small and fragile, I knew deep down that I couldn't say no. And so began our new ritual. Everything was going fine, just normal showers with mother and son. Until I dropped my soap and it fell. You can now check if there's a part two by pressing share and more.

No nut. November. I used to have a best friend named Jack. Everything was cool until he started making gay jokes. He wasn't even gay. He was just trying to be annoying. It started small at first. Normal joked about me being handsome and stuff like that. But within weeks, the gay jokes became his new form of rage bait. He'd make jokes about how I want him. So when we both got detention at the same time, he kept calling it our detention date and making kissy faces when the teacher wasn't looking. We were five minutes into detention when his hand starts moving up and down under the desk at lightning speed. And there's no paper on his desk. It. It was like he was asserting dominance or something, making sure I knew this was about me. He was breathing like he just ran a Marathon while sitting completely still. He looks up right at me. Not a glance. Full eye contact while his hand is still going full turbo under the desk. My brain just froze. Like when your computer shows you that spinning wheel of death. Then I noticed his chair. He's turned it toward me. And the angle. When he finishes, it's gonna hit my face. I had two minutes, maybe less. His face was getting red. I tried to reach for the phone in my pocket to someone to help, but the teacher, Mister Evans, notices Instantly. Phone on my desk. Now. Mister Evans has a radar for phones, I swear. You know the rules. I walk up and put it on his desk. Locks it in his drawer. Great. No lifeline, no evidence, no nothing. While I was walking back, I can see Jack tracking me with his eyes. That same smirk from when he'd make his stupid jokes. But his hand hasn't stopped moving. I get up real quiet and start moving to the empty seat behind him. Where do you think you're going? Evans doesn't even look up. It's assigned seating only. Go back to your seat, sir. I just need to. You need to apologize to Jack for disrupting his concentration and sit back down. Wait, what? I'm sorry. Go on, apologize. I look at Jack. His smirk gets bigger. Sorry, Jack. His voice comes out all breathless and weird. It's cool, bro. Good. Now sit down. The walk back felt like death row. Lucia, the girl I've had a crush on since freshman year, notices what's happening. Her face goes from confused to horrified to.

So buckle up, because this isn't one of those he fired me and I found a better job karma law posts. No, this is a scorched earth, burn the bridge, salt the ashes situation. I worked at this small tech company for 3 years. I busted my ass. I pulled 70 hour weeks. I trained his nephew. I basically ran the whole damn department while this loud, balding, overcaffeinated micromanager sat in his glass office pretending to be Steve Jobs. Last month, I walked in on a Monday morning and found an HR email waiting for me. Not a meeting, not a warning. An email. We regret to inform you that due to restructuring, your position has been terminated, effective immediately. Restructuring my ass. The next day, I found out his nephew, the same one who asked me how to attach a PDF, got my job and a pay raise. So I snapped. And when I snap, I don't break plates. I break lives. I knew three things. One, his wife Samantha, hated him. Two, his son Tyler, 22, was in my DMs months ago. Oh. His daughter Mia, 25, once told me at a company barbecue that she likes people who take risks. Do you see where this is going? I started with Samantha. I took her out for drinks to vent. One thing LED to another, and let's just say she vented in ways her husband Hadn't experienced in years then because apparently I fully unlocked my villain arc. I replied to Tyler's old DM. Still wanna grab that drink? Tyler came over. We grabbed more than drinks. I'll spare you the details, but let's just say his Xbox wasn't the only thing overheating that night. And then Mia. God bless Mia. She's gorgeous, she's chaotic, and apparently she had a vendetta against her dad too. Within 48 hours, I had an entire side quest going with his entire family tree. Here's where it gets truly evil. I knew my ex boss had a ring camera system. Guess who accidentally left their Bluetooth speaker connected to their living room TV? Yeah, he saw everything live in 4K. Next Monday he tried to confront me in the parking lot of a Starbucks. I just smiled, sipped my caramel macchiato, and said, should have attached the termination letter as a PDF. Boss. The man's face turned the color of a sunburnt tomato. Do I regret it? Absolutely not. Do I have a job now? Also no. But you know what I do have? Peace, satisfaction, and at least three birthday invites to family barbecues he will never attend again. And that, my friends, is how you turn a layoff into a legacy.

What happened? I was driving cross country for grad school when I stopped at this sketchy truck stop in Oklahoma. The bathroom was disgusting, but I really had to go. While sitting there, I noticed someone had carved if found, call this number into the stall door with a phone number underneath. I thought it was weird. Like what did they mean if found? Was it a joke, some kind of scavenger hunt? I took a picture of it with my phone, mostly because it seemed random and funny. Two days later, I'm bored in my new apartment with terrible Wi-Fi and no cable yet. I'm scrolling through my photos and see the bathroom number again. Some stupid reason. I decide to call it. What's the worst that could happen, right? A woman answers on the third ring. Hello. She sounds tired, maybe middle aged. I feel like an idiot immediately. Um, hey, this is going to sound really weird, but I found your number written in a bathroom stall in Oklahoma. It said, if found, call this number. So I thought I'd call and see what's up. Dead silence, like complete silence for maybe 10 seconds. What town? She asks. And her voice is different now, shaky. Somewhere outside Tulsa, Little Truck stop off I forty. More silence. Then she starts crying. Not like sad crying, but shocked crying. That's my sister's phone number, she whispers. She's been Missing for three years. My stomach drops. This went from funny to horrible real fast. Explains that her sister Jessica was 22 when she disappeared. She'd been driving from Texas to Kansas for a job interview. Her phone last pinged at that exact truck stop before going dead. Police searched everywhere but found nothing. Tell her I'm driving back that way tomorrow and I'll check the bathroom again. She gives me her name, Linda, and begs me to look for anything, any clue about what happened to Jessica. The next morning, I drive three hours back to that truck stop. The bathroom is just as gross as before. I examine every inch of that stall. Behind the toilet paper dispenser, there's a tiny gap where the metal me.

What did I do now? I looked up, confused. Have you checked your phone this morning, Miss O'connor asked. Carefully. I reached for it but remembered it had died on the bus. It's dead. Why? The entire classroom went silent. Miss O'connor shifted uncomfortably and adjusted her glasses. Please just go to the office. My heart started racing because something was seriously wrong. Whatever this was, it had made my teacher look at me like I was made of glass about to break. I grabbed my dead phone and my backpack and headed for the door. I needed to find my best friend, Justin. Justin's classroom was down the hall. I knocked and pointed at him through the window. Mister Brady let him out immediately without asking questions. The second we got into the hallway, Justin grabbed me in the tightest hug. Dude, oh, my god. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry about Dylan. Dylan, my brother's name. And hit me like ice water. Dylan, who was 24 and still lived at home. What about Dylan? My voice sounded far away. Justin pulled back, his eyes red. You don't know, dude. Everyone saw it on the way to school this morning, the accident on Route 47. Your brother's green Jeep. He paused, swallowing hard. Dylan loved that Jeep more than anything. I was already running. Mom was at the Office, signing me out with shaking hands. The secretary couldn't meet my eyes. Mom just grabbed my arm and guided me toward the parking lot. Her face was pale and her lips were pressed into a thin line. Mom, is Dylan okay? She just unlocked the car and got in. I got in. My heart pounding. Your dad is on his way home from his work trip, she finally said, her voice barely above a whisper. We're waiting for a call. But Dylan, she cut me off before I could finish. When we get home, we'll talk when we get home. Her voice was firm, but I could hear the tremor underneath. The drive felt like hours. Mom's knuckles were white on the steering wheel. I kept trying to make sense of it. The Jeep, the accident. Dylan. Mom stayed in the car. On the phone. I used my key. The house was quiet, too quiet. Then I heard it. Sports center. I walked into the living room and there he was, Dylan on the couch in boxers and that stupid Metallica shirt with holes in it, eating cereal straight from the box. Very much alive. What the hell, I said. He looked up, annoyed. Shouldn't you be at school? You're dead. The words came out flat. Everyone think.

We've been living together for, like, seven months now, and honestly, she's awesome. When we first moved in, she told me about some really heavy stuff from her past. She went through a lot as a kid, like abuse and worse. My own sister actually went through something similar, and she died from it. So when my roommate opened up to me, I got it. I really got it. Living with her is honestly the easiest thing ever. She does the dishes without me asking. She even does my laundry and folds it, which I keep telling her she doesn't have to do, but she says it makes her happy to help out. And she always looks genuinely excited when I come home and find everything clean. The only weird thing is our apartment looks like a unicorn threw up everywhere. Purple and pink stuff on every surface. But whatever. Small price to pay for an amazing roommate. The thing about my roommate is she has this massive teddy bear. And I mean massive. This thing is bigger than she is. She named it Eva after her mom, who passed away. Her parents gave it to her when she was nine, and it's basically her most important possession. It sits on her bed, and sometimes when I walk past her room, I can see her hugging it while she watches TV. So last week, my sister calls Me up. She's seven months pregnant and crying on the phone, saying she needs a place to crash. Her boyfriend kicked her out or something. I didn't get all the details. I told her I needed to check with my roommate first, because that's just basic respect, right? My roommate said it was fine. She's really nice like that. My sister shows up with two suitcases, and the first thing she does when she walks in is look at Eva sitting on my roommate's bed and just starts laughing, like, full on cackling. She goes, what is that thing? And I immediately told her to knock it off. Then she sees my roommate come out of her room wearing this pink dress with bows on it, and my sister makes this face. My sister's always been a tomboy. Like, she lives in basketball shorts and hoodies. So she starts making comments about my roommate's clothes. Stuff like, you look like you're going to a kid's birthday party, and does the Easter Bunny know you stole his outfit? I shut that down pretty quick, but my sister just rolled her eyes at me. The next few days were rough. My sister kept making little comments. He'd walk past my roommate's room and go, still sleeping with stuffed animals, huh? Loud enough for everyone to hear. When my roommate would do the dishes, my sister would be like, you don't have to be a housewife, you know? In this condescending voice. And The teddy bear thing really bothered her for some reason. She kept bringing up how my roommate named it Eva and saying stuff like, it's a toy. It doesn't need a name. You're 20 years old. I told my sister multiple times to stop. I explained that my roommate had her reasons and to just be respectful. My sister would say okay, but then do it again the next day. On day five, I came home from class, and my roommate wasn't in the living room like usual. I figured she was in her room, so I went to put my backpack down. That's when I heard it crying. Like, not just crying, full on sobbing coming from my roommate's room. I knocked and asked if I could come in, and she said yes, but her voice was all shaky. I opened the door, and she was sitting on her bed holding Eva. Except Eva wasn't whole anymore. There was this huge cut right down the middle of the bear's stomach. Stuffing was coming out everywhere. My roommate's face was red and covered in tears, and she could barely get the words out. She kept saying, she cut Eva. She cut Eva over and over. I asked her what happened, and she said my sister came in her room while she was in the shower and must have done it. I looked at the cut, and it was clean, like, done with Scissors or a knife. This wasn't an accident. I walked straight to the living room where my sister was on the couch eating chips and watching TV. I asked her if she cut my roommate's teddy bear and she literally started laughing. She said she's 20, she shouldn't be sleeping with toys anyway. I told her that was completely out of line and she needed to pack her stuff and leave. That's when she switched up real quick. She put her hand on her stomach and was like, I'm pregnant. You can't kick me out. It's just pregnancy hormones making me act crazy. I said I didn't care about hormones. She destroyed something that meant everything to my roommate, and she didn't even apologize. She started getting loud, saying I was choosing some random girl over my own sister and her baby. I told her she made the choice. When she decided to be cruel for no reason, she grabbed her suitcases and left, slamming the door so hard a picture frame fell off the wall.

Now he hasn't initiated anything for six months, and I'm the bad guy? At first, I felt relieved. No more getting groped while doing dishes. No more feeling his excitement every time we hugged. Finally, I could just exist without everything being sexual. But by week two, something felt wrong. Austin walked past me in the kitchen and just said, excuse me, instead of his usual waist squeeze. We felt like roommates. I brought it up. He was devastatingly logical. You said my physical responses were disgusting. I don't wanna make you uncomfortable again. I tried explaining that wasn't what I meant, but he just shrugged. It happens naturally when I'm close to you. Since I can't control it, I'm avoiding situations where it might happen. The worst part? He sounded so reasonable, like he genuinely thought this through and decided this was the only solution to my complaint. So you're punishing me forever? I asked after he declined movie cuddles again. I'm not punishing you, he said without looking at me. I'm respecting your boundaries. Three months in, I was going insane. I missed feeling desired. I'd dress up, hoping for compliments, but he'd just say I looked nice. In the same tone, he'd comment on whether the irony hit me hard. I'd complained about feeling sexualized, and now I felt completely desexualized. I started testing him. Wore his favorite red dress to dinner, walked around in just his T-shirt after showers. Even accidentally brushed against him while reaching for things. Nothing. It was like touching a polite stranger who was trying to be accommodating. Our friends started noticing, too. At Sarah's birthday party, Austin barely put his arm around me for photos. Before, he couldn't keep his hands off me at social events. Now he stood next to me like we were co workers posing for a company picture. You two okay? Sarah asked when Austin went to get drinks. You see, I'm distant lately. I wanted to scream. How do you explain that you broke your husband's desire for you and now desperately want it back? That you'd become the architect of your own romantic destruction? Month four brought new torture. Austin started working out more, coming home all muscled and sweaty from the gym. Before, he'd have shown off, flexed a little, used any excuse to get me worked up. Now he just showered quietly and went to bed early. I caught him on his phone more often, smiling at the screen. When I'd ask what was funny, he'd just say, works stuff and put it away. Before, he used to show me every stupid meme, every funny video. We used to laugh together constantly about the dumbest things. The conversations became surface level pleasantry. How was your day? Fine. Yours? Good. Then silence while we ate dinner like strangers sharing a table at a restaurant. I tried initiating intimacy myself, but Austin would respond just enough to not Completely reject me, then pull back before things could get heated. It was like he was keeping himself on a tight leash, and I hated every second of it. By month five, Austin went on a work trip. When he came back, something had shifted. Not just distant politeness, but something else. Like he figured something out. During those six days away. There was this settled quality to him, like he made peace with something I didn't understand yet. I tried welcoming him home the old way. Excited hugs, kisses, telling him how much I'd missed him. He responded like I was a friend, being overly affectionate, polite, but visibly uncomfortable with the physical contact. That's when real panic set in. What if this was permanent? What if I'd actually broken something fundamental that couldn't be fixed? What if Austin had finally realised he was happier without all the drama I've been putting him through?

My marriage ended because my grown husband decided toilet paper was beneath him, like literally beneath him, which was the whole problem. It started on a Tuesday. We were getting ready for bed and I noticed this smell. Not like normal bathroom smell, something worse. I asked him if he showered and he said yeah, but the smell stayed for two days. I thought maybe our cat was sick or something died in the walls. Then I was doing laundry and picked up his boxers. They were completely destroyed. Like I'm talking streaks that would make a skid Mark look like a faint pencil line. I almost threw up right there holding them with two fingers over the washer. I confronted him immediately, asked him straight up what was going on. This man, this 32 year old man I married, looked me dead in the eye and said alphas don't wipe. I laughed. I thought he was joking. He wasn't joking. He said he'd been watching these videos online about alpha males and how modern men have been feminized by society. wiping your butt after using the bathroom is something betas do. Real men just pull up their pants and go about their day because they're too powerful to care about basic hygiene. I told him that was the dumbest thing I'd ever heard. He got defensive and said I wouldn't understand because I'm a woman. Then he spent 20 Minutes trying to explain alpha male theory to me while I stood there holding his ruined underwear. The next day he went to the grocery store with me. We ran into his coworker, Devin in the produce section. Normal guy, has a wife and two kids. My husband walks right up to him, interrupts him picking out apples and says, hey, man, do you wipe? Devin just stared at him. My husband goes, alphas don't wipe, just so you know. Devin grabbed his apples and left without saying anything. This kept happening everywhere. The gas station, his mom's house for dinner. He told the guy at the tire shop he was on a mission to spread this information like it was some kind of public service. I stopped doing his laundry, told him if he wanted to live like that, he could handle his own destroyed clothes. He said that was fine and just kept wearing the same pairs over and over. Our bedroom started smelling like a porta potty at a summer festival. I tried reasoning with him, showed him articles about infections and health risks. He said those were written by beta doctors trying to keep men weak. I suggested therapy. He said therapists are part of the problem. His friends stopped coming over. My sister refused to visit. Our couch got a permanent stain because he'd sit there for hours watching more alpha male videos. The final straw was when he tried to get our neighbor's teenage Son involved. The kid was washing his car and my husband went over there to tell him about alpha wiping habits. The mom came outside and told us to stay away from her family. I filed for divorce that week. He acted shocked, said I was overreacting and couldn't handle a real man. I told him real men don't walk around with crusty underwear spreading conspiracy theories about bathroom hygiene. The divorce was quick since we didn't have kids. He tried to convince the mediator that I was leaving him for beta mails. She just stared at her papers and didn't respond.

He smeared it right across her forehead. Next came a bowl of holy water, shoved it right in her face. When he saw her resisting, the giant totally lost it. Realizing she had no choice, the girl finally drank it down. But here's the twist. Within seconds, her terrible wounds completely healed. This whole time the giant meant no harm. Seeing grey was okay, the giant just turned and walked away. Stranded in the wilderness, grey found this broken down shack. Soon her brother, C y R y L tracked her down, an unexpected family reunion. But before they could even celebrate, the black witch hunting them showed up. Gray grabbed a metal pipe and hurled it, but the witch batted it away like nothing. With one casual hand gesture, she magically sealed every exit and she dropped the bombshell. Turns out the sibling's mother was once an incredibly powerful white witch. Years ago, framed by the Black Witches, she was burned alive by villagers. Even their father was hanged by the mind controlled townspeople. Now get this, if she obtained Gray's heart, she'd become the most powerful black witch ever. To protect his sister, C y R y L attacked first, but the Black Witch stabbed him, shoved him into the basement and took gray by force. When C W R y L woke up, Mina, the girl he'd saved earlier, was standing over him. Even More shocking, stab wound had completely vanished. Turns out Mina was actually the last surviving White Witch in the world. For years, she'd been secretly protecting them. To rescue Greyfast, C, y, L broke out his entire weapons collection. Mina sprinkled magic infused potions over all the equipment. The moment they were ready, the team stormed straight toward the Black Witch's lair.

Suddenly, the liquid starts clinging to his skin. Feels like a thousand needles stabbing him. Even though it's burning like crazy, he keeps going through the pain. He's massaging this weird formula into his head, having no clue what's about to go down. Just 60 minutes earlier, he ordered this bottle online. Seller promised miraculous results. The instructions say, step 1, shave your head completely. Step 2, apply the solution. Step 3, wear the silicone cap. Wait a few minutes, boom, instant thick hair. He's staring at his reflection, debating with himself. Finally grabs the Scissors, chops off his hair, then takes a razor to get it completely smooth, pops open the bottle and sees the liquid actually moving inside. He freezes, staring at the salesmen, trust me, smile on the label. After a moment of doubt, he goes for it. The moment it touches his scalp, fire shoots through his skull. But he keeps squeezing the bottle harder and suddenly the liquid sprays straight into his eyes. He stumbles back, crashes to the floor, desperately flushing his eyes with water. That's when things get really weird. Dude starts playing video games with an alien.

We're the one protecting human rights, but you're trying to get rid of the option so people can have rights to their own body. Hold on. If someone does not want to have a child, they should not be forced to if, if the. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait if we're gonna be doing this said, what are you gonna do about the children in the um the systems that have been being assaulted that are being hurted? Put more money into the system so people can actually get adopted or actually other things like that. Okay, again, none of that is relevant. No, because you want more babies to be born. What about people that can't afford them? How many how many how many people are on the adoption waiting list? Yeah, why don't, how many kids actually get adopted? 2 million kids that go into systems or are fostered that get assaulted, that get hurt. Are you gonna be helping those children that get fucked over by this system? So there are there are 2 million people on the adoption waiting list. There are a million abortions every year. There are twice as many people that want to adopt then discarded children every single year. Now I have to go back to a fundamental question though, okay, which I think is very important human development objectively begins at conception. You say it's around two trimesters. Can we agree? That every human being, once your DNA is formed, you should have the right to life, the right to live the life the way you wanna live it. Can we agree on that? How many weeks are we saying? No, I say again, once. Once it be once we can knowledge. So like once the sperm is inside the egg, correct? Yeah. No, no, well, once the sperm is inside the egg in the first, like a couple of days. No. Well, okay, but let's go through that. Isn't that when your DNA was formed? Yeah, but then aren't you fundamentally at its core, at its core, you are, the DNA is your blueprint for your life. That's who you are. It's a unique marker. It's my DNA. Yeah, yes. So if it's not your DNA, why is it your choice? Why is it my choice? Yes. If it's not your DNA, why do you have a choice to eliminate it? I don't have. It's up to the individual that is having them inside of it. Oh, okay. So their body, I don't care if it is like a few weeks, because that is not a human life. Got it. So out outside of rape, that individual can not survive without the mother or who is OK, ever pregnant. OK, let's go therefore again. So let's get down to this cause I think it's very important and a good way to end this question, which is outside of rape, how Did the woman get pregnant outside of rape? So we're not gonna be talking about incest or other individual rape. Rape because okay is not only just rape. So hold on for other situation. Right, right. If I, how about I say, how about if I say, how about if I say, how about if I say.

If I had a cyst on my uterus, that would be considered an abortion. No, it's not. Yes, it is. No, no, it's not. Yes, it is. Look at, okay, anything that is evolving the uterus. Well, no. Uh, in order for it to be an abortion, it must be a human life. No, anything that's evolving the uterus and you have to get rid of it, it is considered abortion. no. That's not how it is. That's not how it works. So, so again, you say I'm here to take rights away. Yes. Do you agree life is a right? I feel like if it's a clump of cells, then it's not alive. No, But let's go back. Do you think, do you think every human being has a right to life? Depending on how many weeks. But let's, so wait, hold on. Who's trying to take rights away? No, I wanna protect the rights of all human beings. You call them a clump of cells. Who's trying to take rights away? Example. Exactly. So when is it a human being in your mind? When is it a human being in your mind? Well, it's not even on my mind. If human development objectively begins at conception. At conception. So even if I had a miscarriage, what are you gonna say about that? It's a tragedy. It's a tragedy. Yes. Okay, then let's talk about like, what if it's affecting the woman? Or anybody who is pregnant in this situation. What if they're gonna die and they have to get an abortion? That's the only way they're gonna live. Are they gonna be over, well, hold on. Just so we're clear, that's only a couple, that's only a couple thousand cases a year. No. And so, yes, it is. Have you seen, but how many individuals have already died because they haven't been able to get abortion? Abortion in the life of the mother can be put aside as something that needs to be considered. However, it's not always necessary. But let's talk about the main thing, because there's over 1.5 million abortions every single year that don't involve rape, incest or life in the. Yeah, 1.5 million. Yes, but let's, let's just ask you a very simple question. When, when does human life begin? When does human life, and my personal opinion is gonna start around the second trimester, a little more farther along. But let's get to this. Most individuals that are having abortions are gonna be mothers that cannot afford it. They usually have already 2 to 3 kids and a lot of time. So, so, so it's acceptable to be able to murder your young if all of a sudden you don't have the money to support them, that you can, you can murder your offspring if you're poor. So in the first couple weeks, even though it's still not fully developed, does even have a heartbeat, does even have A heartbeat development does not equal dignity. A human being is a human being regardless of the process of development that it is in, period. And so who's trying to take rights away? I actually want more human beings. Then why are you affecting the LGBT, then why are you affecting the LGBT? Well, hold on. We're talking, let, let's, let me finish on abortion. I want more human lives with, by the way, hilariously, would be more women would actually would be born cause the right to life is Paramount. You're trying to take rights away because you're okay with the massacring of little humans. Back to LGBT. It's been going throughout history, though. Abortion has been a big thing for a long time. And it affects people. So, and it hurts people. So as murder and slavery and child sacrifice. There's, that's completely different. No, it, it is murder.

En realidad, estaba fingiendo la muerte. Pensé que lo había engañado con éxito, pero no sabía cuán desconfiado y despiadado era. Levantó la mano y disparó de nuevo a mi lado.

Corrí hasta media ladera y empujé rápidamente las piedras de arriba. Allí resultó haber una cueva antes de que el cazador llegara. Me apresuré a entrar. Baté la estaca que sostenía la entrada, pensando que así escaparía de la persecución, pero la ceniza blanca que brotó de la entrada ya había delatado mi posición, viéndola derrumbarse.

Cayó en un profundo pozo. Su novio, que iba detrás de ella, llegó al borde del pozo. Saltó directamente al interior. Rápidamente, tiró de la mujer hacia el fondo, luego le tapó la boca porque arriba había traficantes. Los traficantes hotearon los alrededores. Al no encontrar nada, se marcharon. En ese momento, la mujer no podía respirar. Al poco tiempo se desmayó. El sonido de sus manos golpeando el agua hizo que el traficante se detuviera. Corrió de vuelta al pozo, se agachó y miró dentro. Afortunadamente, su compañero lo llamó y él se dio la vuelta. Una vez que el hombre confirmó que mike se había ido, rápidamente ayudó a la mujer a salir a la parte menos profunda. Luego la arrastró hasta la pared y la apoyó contra ella. Después, mike se levantó y escudriñó la zona buscando alguna salida. Cogió un palo de madera y golpeó la pared con todas sus fuerzas, pero no dejó ni una sola marca. Frustrado, mike tiró el palo a un lado y despertó a gina. Aterrorizada por los traficantes, mike la abrazó inmediatamente para consolarla. Luego le dio un poco de agua, pero ella se atragantó en cuanto le tocó los labios. Gina insistió en que se quedaran donde estaban y pensar en una forma de escapar al día siguiente. Sin embargo, la tierra que había encima de ellos era blanda, mientras que el suelo debajo era duro como una roca. Subir Era totalmente imposible, así que los 2 se acurrucaron juntos y pasaron la noche. Así, a la mañana siguiente, mike se despertó. Primero apoyó con cuidado a gina contra la pared y recogió algunos palos. Poco después, gina se despertó detrás de mike. Se bajó los pantalones. Mike la miró. Inmediatamente se adelantó para recuperarlos. Rápidamente, se quitó sus propios pantalones y luego mojó las prendas en agua. A continuación, se quitó el cinturón, ató 2h ramas juntas y cogió los pantalones para formar una cuerda. Se acercó a la mujer, la olisqueó y luego miró hacia la pared de 6m de altura. Lanzó el fardo hacia arriba con todas sus fuerzas. La fuerza fue insuficiente. Los palos se deslizaron hacia abajo, casi rompiéndole el cráneo. Reunió sus fuerzas una vez más y los lanzó hacia arriba. Esta vez, el fardo se alojó en el borde de la pared. Tiró hacia abajo para comprobar su estabilidad. Comenzó a trepar con gran esfuerzo. La superficie lisa resultó extremadamente difícil para mike. El palo de madera que utilizaba como apoyo comenzó a doblarse hacia abajo. Mike se apresuró a tirarse hacia arriba con todas sus fuerzas. De repente, su pie resbaló, cayó al suelo y el palo cayó con él. Su pie derecho resultó gravemente herido en la caída. Se sentó en el suelo gimiendo de dolor. Gina se acercó para examinar la herida. Rápidamente arrancó un trozo de tela, lo empapó en agua y lo presionó sobre la herida de mike Luego se subió los pantalones, se puso en cuclillas y vendó la herida de mike con la tela. En ese momento, comenzó a llover torrencialmente. El agua caía en cascada desde arriba. Gina no sabía nadar, temía ahogarse, pero mike se echó a reír solo un poco más. Dijo, cuando la lluvia llene el pozo, podremos salir. De repente, gina resbaló. Se debatía en el agua. Al ver esto, mike la atrajo inmediatamente hacia sus brazos. Allí esperaron en el agua. Si tan solo fuera más profundo, podrían usar la flotabilidad para salir. Sin embargo, al poco tiempo, la lluvia cesó. La esperanza se hizo añicos una vez más. La noche cayó rápidamente y la pareja soportó la noche. Así, al llegar la mañana, el hombre se despertó y bebió agua del charco. De repente, una sonrisa siniestra se extendió por su rostro. Sumergió la mano en el agua y comenzó a metérsela en la boca. La mujer, desconcertada, saltó para investigar. Exigió saber qué estaba haciendo. Lentamente, el hombre se volvió para mirarla

Después de matar a este hombre de un disparo, lo colgaron en un cartel publicitario, desafiando abiertamente la autoridad de la policía, y esta vez no fue diferente. Tras matar a un hombre, arrastraron su cadáver hasta la calle y lo pusieron en una postura sentada, simulando que estaba borracho. Pero nunca imaginaron que esta vez habían provocado a la persona equivocada, porque el padre del chico era liem neeson, el hombre que destruye a toda una banda cuando alguien de su familia es tocado. Pronto, neeson se enteró de la muerte de su hijo. Su esposa, temblando, acariciaba la cara de su hijo muerto sin poder creer que su hijo se había ido. La policía dijo que la causa de la muerte fue una sobredosis de drogas, pero neeson no podía creerlo. Su hijo siempre había sido obediente. No podía haber tocado esas cosas. Neeson quería saber la verdad, pero la policía los despidió rápidamente. La esposa, furiosa, le recriminó a neeson que siempre estaba demasiado ocupado con su trabajo y nunca se preocupaba por su hijo. Después del funeral, su esposa, desconsolada, decidió dejarlo. La familia que antes era feliz se rompió de repente. Neeson, devastado, pensó en acabar con su vida, pero justo en ese momento, kevin, el compañero de su hijo, apareció. Le reveló la verdad a neeson. Resulta que unos días antes, kevin había visto a los gánsteres traficando y en su codicia, escondió una bolsa de drogas Esto desató la venganza de la banda. Justo ese día, el hijo de neeson estaba trabajando horas extras y fueron secuestrados por los gánsteres. Kevin aprovechó un momento para escapar saltando del coche, pero el hijo de nelson no tuvo la misma suerte. Después de ser brutalmente torturado, fue asesinado. Al saber la verdad, nelson estalló de ira pensando en el sufrimiento que su hijo había pasado antes de morir. Juró vengarse rápidamente. Gracias a la información de kevin, encontró a uno de los asesinos. Pero tan pronto como nelson habló, el hombre lo reconoció y trató de atacarlo con una pistola. Sin embargo, nelson reaccionó rápidamente y lo abatió de un disparo. Luego le exigió que le dijera quién mató a su hijo. El hombre, aterrorizado, confesó que su jefe era el hombre barbudo. Después de obtener lo que quería, neeson no dudó y lo mató de un tiro. Luego envolvió el cadáver en una red de alambre y lo arrojó al agua fría del río. Tras varios días esperando, neeson finalmente descubrió la ubicación del hombre barbudo. Lo interceptó y le dio un golpe. Pero este hombre también era duro. No solo no reveló quién estaba detrás de todo, sino que, furioso, maldijo a neeson al ver que no sacaría nada útil de él. Neeson lo mató de un disparo y lo envió al infierno. Sin pistas, neeson fue a ver a su hermano brock, quien estaba involucrado en el crimen organizado. Tras conocer toda la situación, brock Concluyó que los hombres que neeson había matado eran subordinados de un gánster conocido como viking, un hombre brutal y sanguinario que ya había matado a más de 10 personas. Matarlo no sería fácil. Para proteger a neeson, brock sugirió contratar a un asesino profesional. Neeson aceptó el consejo y contactó a un asesino pagándole 50.000 dólares para que matara a viking. Pero lo que neeson no sabía era que el asesino no tenía ética profesional. Después de recibir el dinero, vendió la información a viking por $100,000. Lo que el asesino no esperaba era que viking odiara profundamente a las personas sin ética profesional, así que inmediatamente hizo que alguien cerrara las cortinas y poco después el asesino fue sacado del lugar. Viking, siguiendo la pista, encontró a brock para proteger a su hermano. Brock confesó todo, incluyendo los asesinatos de los subordinados de viking. Así quería proteger a su hermano por última vez en el funeral de brock. Neeson estaba devastado. Juró encontrar a viking y vengar tanto a su hermano como a su hijo

They like, brown. And I still had the phone in my hand. They like, brown, give us the phone. I'm holding the phone like this. The goon squad is at the door. They got the dog, the K9 with them. It's a bunch of them. I'm just sitting there looking. I hold the phone to my side. After I exhale, my celly left the cell. So now I'm sitting in this cell by myself. The gunner got the Mini 14 on me. The goon squad is out here with the dog. They like, give us the phone. I said, I ain't giving you shit. I slam the phone on the ground. I just start breaking it. And they know not to rush in there cause it could be a fight automatically. So when I slam it on the ground, then I go to the toilet to flush it. When I go to the toilet to flush it, then they try to grab me out. So now it's like they grabbing me by my legs. I'm hanging on to the toilet. I'm flushing the phone down the toilet. Finally get it down. When they put me out the sale, then They put our hands on the rail, and they start watching this and all the stuff. Pat me down. And then I remember I got this little bitty grass that I was still smoking in my boxer, right? So I'm like, oh, smack! So I reach my hand in my box. It is like, he's making a move. He's making a move. And they rush me, and I throw it in my mouth. Boom! When I throw it in my mouth, they all slam me on the brown, handcuff me, and they take me straight to the potty watch, to the hole. Now, for those who don't know what potty watch is, potty watch is when they have all these officers around me. They take my ankles up, they give me this long jumpsuit. They take your ankles up, they take your wrist up, they take your neck up so nothing can come out. And then they sit you in a cell with no toilet, no anything, no nothing. And officer just watches you. Then when you need to use the bathroom, like 5, six, 7 officers are gonna come surround you. They gonna untape all the stuff. They gonna sit a bucket down. They gonna tell you, squat over the bucket and shit. So whatever you ate, whatever you put in your mouth, whatever you stuck in your ass, they finna get it. I take a dump, and, like, this little bitty, tiny 0.0003 grams of grass that I Was smoking. Comes out, why does dude say he got 4.4 grams for my stool? So then he goes and writes the report. He said, recovered 4.4 grams of. From the stool of Mr. Brown. When I have the ball movement, they like, what's this? I said, oh, it's just a little bit of grass. I admitted it. I acknowledged it. Right then when I get the report, it's 4.4 grams. That turns it from, like, possession to sales.

He'd buy the AB Roller for $12 from China and he'd run ads and then he'd sell them Cod like, yeah, yeah, just call and order it. You can pay when it gets there. And people would call up and want the AB Roller and it's $250. They mail it to them. They don't really tell them on the phone how much it is. They think it's 49 bucks. There's really like five payments of $49 and then they just mail them and say, oh, it's $250 and they're like, oh, I'm not gonna take this. They don't accept it. And so then he had a collections department that then started hounding them and hounding them, hounding them. The difference was with Caesar, the people he was targeting were illegals. These guys would start saying, you owe this much money. Oh, I'm not gonna pay that man. And they'd say, listen, bro, I got your address. We're gonna file with the county, we're gonna get a warrant. And now they're starting to think, oh, the cop might show up. But then they wait 10 days, they call them back and then they say, we filed a warrant and they'll mail paperwork to him. It looks like a warrant's been filed. Like they don't know what they're looking at. Five days after that, they call up as like a police officer, like a sheriff, you've got a warrant, it's now $750. It keeps going up. The warrants have been filed, such and such, or we're gonna need you to turn yourself in, that kind of thing.

He's like 60. Uh, what you locked up for embezzlement. And he was like, man, I was opening up these accounts, putting these fake checks in them and getting the money out before the bank knew about it. He was walking me through every step of what he did. He was a bad, bad man. He was telling me like little things to do like man, when you get out, try this and work alone. Don't go out there and deal with a lot of people. I get out of jail, I come home from prison. So I'm like, I'm thinking about all the stuff the dude was telling me in jail like so I went and open up an account with bank of America. We moved into this house. The people that lived there prior, they had some still coming. So one day I opened up this mail. There was credit card checks where you could write them out and it would just charge your credit card. They was blank. So I wrote my name on them. You can just make one out to yourself. Do it for like 88 hundred, you know, something like this, like 2,005. You had to put your check inside the envelope, then put in machine and type in how much it was. I put the check in there, wrote it out to myself, signed the fake name on there, whatever and It posted so now I got eighty eight hundred dollars in my bank account probably took like two days to post the money is in my account I go and withdraw all the money out in the branch. I'm like damn it work and I ain't go to jail they just closed the account. I'm like I gotta come up with a plan give me a group of people just turn this thing all the way up and that's what I did I went to the hood and I found all these dudes that was broke man I had them working for me and what I would do is I might sign you up for like four or five banks I give them the money for the deposit and everything and once I sign you up for the banks I will order checks so back then you you could get the money well no matter what you put on the check they wanna grant you the money and put it in an account so I'm like this is crazy man like I'm finna be a millionaire and I was I got like 20 30 dudes working for me at this time this 0 5 when you deposit with bank of America you can get $500 instant so if I got 20 cars in front of me I know for a fact I'm gonna get $500 each car that's 10,000 cash instant that's going in my pocket. We came up with A plan.

And then I remember I got this little bitty grass that I was still smoking in my boxer, right? So I'm like, oh, smack! So I reach my hand in my boxer. It's like, he's making a move. He's making a move. And they rush me, and I throw it in my mouth. Boom! When I throw it in my mouth, they all slam on the ground, handcuff me, and they take me straight to the potty watch, to the whole.

It's for good paperwork table. And I'm like, what's paperwork? He explains that paperwork shows that you're not a defender, you didn't snitch on anyone. And until you get your paperwork, you're not allowed to sit at that table. And I was explaining to him that I'm there for fraud and he looks at me, he's like, yeah, that's what they all say. And he points to this table. It's a bunch of old white guys with the same type of glasses I had on that are staring at me like fresh meat. Eventually I got my paperwork and everything got sorted out, but that was a reality of what I was gonna be labeled at in a federal prison. What other things did you see smuggled into prison? A lot of food, like Chinese food, sushi, pizza, like we had a whole Mexican buffet one time. Gym clothes, watches, jewelry, pretty much anything from the street is considered like a high commodity item at these facilities. There's one guard for 400 inmates. Before count or after count, these guys would run Across the field and go to the local motel, have their wife or girlfriend pick them up and hook up with them. And they'd have someone at the camp keeping guard to make sure they don't call an emergency count or anything and then they sneak back in. I would do that. Sometimes people would pay me to pick up the bags that would have cell phones, that would have food and that would have sneakers, weight equipment, anything.

He fights back and it gets to be a big fight. And the guy she sent in there ends up getting the guy in like a headlock, breaks his neck, chokes him to death, something. He dies. Oh, he kills him. FBI comes in, grabs her. They interview the guy. He doesn't lawyer up. What he says is, she put me in that cell. I was just supposed to beat the guy up, but it got out of hand because the guy fought back and it was really bad. They go to her and they say 10 years We'll give you 10 years. We know you didn't mean for him to die. She says, no, I'm not doing 10 years. Fuck that. She goes to trial. She got 30 years or life.

Pero después de la violenta explosión, la gruesa piel y carne del dragón apenas sufrieron daño alguno. El capitán, al ver eso, abrió fuego rápidamente para contenerlo mientras hacía señas a todos para que se retiraran y buscaran cobertura. Justo cuando el dragón rugió y volvió a lanzarse al ataque. En ese momento crítico, un cazarrecompensas actuó de repente. Una flecha envuelta en explosivos silbó por el aire, aunque tampoco logró causarle daño real al dragón. Su ataque efectivo le dio tiempo a Alice y a los demás para esconderse en una cueva. Sin embargo, el cuerpo del enorme dragón era demasiado pesado. Ni siquiera rompiéndose sus propios cuernos pudo abrirse paso. Finalmente, solo pudo rugir de furia y regresar derrotado al desierto. Pero cuando todos pensaban que la crisis había terminado por un rato, nadie imaginó que algo aún más aterrador había sido despertado. Por suerte, su compañero reaccionó rápido, apuntó de inmediato el rifle francotirador a sus ojos y con fuego de cobertura lograron hacer retroceder a la araña, pero cuando corrieron para atender a la inconsciente Alice, uno del equipo, descubrió que más arañas se acercaban desde todas las direcciones

He likes to dress up like a baby, then find a young, pretty woman to be a nanny and take care of him. But if a woman refuses, he kills her without hesitation. Up until today, 99 women have already died by his hand. This time, he ran into a woman named Anna. This day was Anna's first day at work. As soon as she walked into the house, she heard the sound of a baby crying upstairs. Following the sound, she slowly walked toward a baby stroller. But when she lifted the blanket, inside was only an old, broken doll. Before she had time to react, a man wearing a diaper in colorful baby clothes suddenly appeared, grabbed her arm tightly, and threatened her, saying if she didn't obey him, he would kill Anna right there. Anna was terrified. She had no choice but to cooperate, changing his diaper as he demanded, taking away the pad, and cleaning up his filth. The man looked very satisfied. He even put down the hammer in his hand. But just then, Anna suddenly grabbed the dirty diaper in reverse and slapped it hard across the man's face. Then, without looking back, she ran downstairs.

He wiped away the moisture and dressed her with simple care. But this time he encountered a body that it seemed unusual. Her eyes refused to close, and no matter how long he gently massaged them, nothing worked. So he finally took out a bit of glue and sealed the eyelids together. Then he began applying makeup. As the most seasoned mortuary artist, he brushed a soft blush onto her cheeks, shaped her brows and added a delicate color to her lips. Yet something felt off. The woman's mouth stayed open the whole time. The man retrieved a coin, murmured a short incantation, and the moment he placed the coin into the corpse's mouth snapped shut immediately. Once everything was prepared, his co workers would come to wheel the body out so the family could say their final goodbye. Only then could the man take a brief rest. But night soon arrived and he had to head out for his other job, because this man was not only a mortician, he was also an exorcist.

When the aggressors closed in once more, the gentleman finally raised his voice in protest. Yet his limited demand for mere apology inadvertently fueled Thug's escalating boldness. The blond haired provocateur pressed his advantage, hissing venomous insults. And though the young man's knuckles tightened with strain, he maintained an outward show of calm composure. The observing young lady could no longer conceal her dismay. She chastised her partner's lack of fortitude, decisively severing their romantic tie before disappearing into the neon lit night. Amidst the amber glow of whiskey glasses, stranger's silhouette gradually approached. Just as she prepared to decline his advance, she recognized the two familiar figures from earlier. Perceiving her unsettled gaze, immediately, the newcomer leaned close with gentle inquiry. Upon learning of the daytime altercation, he abruptly turned and summoned the offenders with authority.

His wife inherited the house and private jet. Even his unaccomplished son received $500 million, while the remaining money was all donated to welfare institutions. Yet his most sensible daughter received nothing. Anna couldn't understand why her father, who loved her most, had left her nothing. While Anna was feeling very confused, the lawyer called her over and gave her an envelope, saying inside would be the answer she wanted. After opening it, she found a key and a USB drive. The USB contained a video recorded by her father before his death. In the video, her father mentioned the location of a basement and told her she must keep what was inside a secret. Anna was very puzzled by her father's words. To resolve her confusion, Anna went to the basement her father mentioned, then opened the door and slowly walked in. The dim basement made Anna feel very frightened, but she still summoned the courage to move forward. Little did she know what she would see next would shock her immensely. When she entered the innermost room, she discovered an elderly person being held captive. Anna stared at the old person motionless, tentatively extending her hand to see if the person was alive. But unexpectedly, in the next moment, the terrified Anna quickly fled from there. Upon returning home, Anna picked up the phone to call the police, but remembering her father's words, She abandoned the idea. Anna was desperate to uncover the old person's secret. To prevent the elderly person from discovering her identity, Anna deliberately wore a mask when entering the room. Surprisingly, this proved completely ineffective. The old person recognized her with just a glance and seemed to know everything about her. They even knew about the birthmark on her buttocks. She demanded to know who the old person was, but at that moment, the old person proposed a strange condition. Anna removed her useless mask.

They even fought with each other in order to grab the water pipe. As a result, the woman accidentally pressed the water bag hidden on her body. The robbers got furious immediately when they saw this. The man still wanted to drink a few more mouthfuls, but he was kicked flying by the robber with one kick.

She thought the sweater looked extremely strange. The soft texture glistened unnaturally and it seemed smaller than usual. She asked him to turn around, but he wiggled awkwardly and refused. Just as she was about to get angry, Ray froze completely still. His wife assumed the video had frozen and quickly hung up. In reality, Ray was just posing like a model. He had been lying to his wife all this time, making her believe he was studying in Russia, though she often video called to check his whereabouts. In truth, he had never left the country, staying in his small hometown the entire time, Ray helped boost the local economy, achieving remarkable result and the villagers adored him. They even wore wigs to pretend to be foreigners, helping Ray deceive his wife during call. One afternoon, his wife called again and Ray was painting outside as usual. She first complimented the beautiful scenery, but then noticed something odd. The signal tower behind Ray had Chinese characters, immediately raising her suspicion. She asked him why and Ray quickly made up an excuse. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew his wig off, landing squarely on his face, nearly revealing his secret. Luckily, his friend signaled in time and everyone froze instantly. His wife thought the video had frozen again, checking her screen to see no one moving. She ended the Call and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Over time, the village prospered more and more.

It was meant to fall into the beggar's cup, but instead it landed at the feet of the man walking behind her. The man bent down swiftly, snatching the coin with a sly glint in his eyes. Without hesitation, he strode into the nearby casino and fed the coin into a slot machine. The button was pressed, and in an instant, a miracle unfolded. A Jackpot on his very first try. Onlookers froze, stunned beyond words. Ethan collected the overflowing winnings with a calm smile and walked out of the casino. A new street game caught his attention. The Game Master handed people coins promising triple returns on their bets. Ethan stepped forward, intrigued. He had to find the queen among three cards. With confidence, he placed a hundred dollar bet on the first card. The card was revealed. It was the queen. His money tripled in an instant. The Game Master invited him for another round, and Ethan accepted. This time the cards were shuffled with lightning speed. Ethan watched every movement, every flick of the hand. When prompted to choose, he boldly bet $500 on the third card. The Game Master panicked. Once again, Ethan was correct. Fuming with rage, the Game Master demanded another round. But this time, as the cards were shuffled, Ethan didn't look at them at all. He fixed his gaze on the Game. Master's eyes! Without hesitation, the Game Master pointed at the middle card. And again Ethan was right. The master exploded in fury and ran off.

Then he remembered she had a young daughter downstairs. He saw the girl cautiously climbing into the tunnel. Luckily, she had just in time before the gang began their discussion. Remaining completely undiscovered, the police chief scheduled the heist for exactly ten PM, warning his gang not to touch safe deposit box No. 88. It contained money belonging to his superior. After the gang departed, Victor rescued the girl and executed an even bolder plan, infiltrate the vault before the gang could arrive. He carefully chiseled through the reinforced floor, selectively stole the boxes the chief had explicitly warned about, and took half of the explosives the gang intended to use, cleverly rigging them to the water pipes. When the gang leader triggered the bomb, the tunnel flooded rapidly. Several accomplices drowned and two were trapped helplessly inside the vault as the water rose steadily. They had no choice but to trigger the alarm, and the panicked gang leader fled in terror. Victor then erased every trace of his presence, washed the thick MUD off himself and told the arriving police that his basement had simply flooded. After a brief skeptical search, they found nothing and left the scene. Victor had just exhaled a deep sigh of relief when another knock came sharply at the door. He opened it Cautiously. And there stood the gang from next door, glaring with furious eyes.

Thirty two year old Kenneth White was driving his van on the interstate when suddenly a seven pound rock flew down from an overpass, striking white in the head and chest. Father of four died instantly. The perpetrators were four teenagers aged between 15 and seventeen. In court they yelled and danced around thinking they'd soon be released because of their young age. When their defense lawyer tried to convince the judge to prosecute them as juveniles, the judge firmly denied the request, saying the proposal for juvenile sentencing is rejected. Plaus erupted from the victim's family. Now these teenagers will be tried as adults facing potential life sentences. Do you support the judge's decision? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

She cautiously approached the bunker for inspection, thinking the gate had been locked, but found that the piled up bodies were preventing the door from closing, which unexpectedly created an opportunity for her to enter. She jumped from the entrance and countless bodies cushioned her fall. Expression on her face was grim, indicating that she was in great pain. Before death, people would rather inhale toxic gas than escape from here. As if something even more terrifying was hidden inside the door. Facing the different air pressures inside and outside, she inserted a pry bar into the crack of the door and used her entire body weight to press down.

Marcus. That day, his son, was planning to head out and watch a game. But midway through the drive, he got a call from his father telling him the big news. His study abroad application had finally been approved. His father told him to come home right away. At the moment he turned around, a white police officer stopped him. The officer ordered him to keep both hands on the steering wheel. But Jack simply wanted to set his phone down on the passenger seat first. And he saw it happen. Marcus, a kid on the verge of leaving for overseas, was beaten to death in the street. The court ruled that Jack had been reckless driving and the officer was just doing his duty. A verdict he couldn't accept. Day after day, he lived in grief. Even as a member of Parliament, he still couldn't get justice for his own son. If the law couldn't protect the truth, he would do it himself. He would avenge his boy. He began digging for information everywhere. Finally, a mysterious figure provided substantial evidence. Notes describing the entire incident, along with files on other victims and their families. He thought that with this evidence, he could finally clear his son's name. But that night, high ranking officials came knocking, warning him to drop the investigation. They stated bluntly that the whole case had been buried by the police chief as part of a bribe to help The mayor win reelection. He knew he couldn't fight them alone, so he reached out to the families of other victims and planned to expose the illegal payoff to the public. That night, they detonated a car on the roadside to distract the mayor's security. Then they slipped upstairs toward the safe. But the moment they reached the landing, they bumped into the nanny coming out of the bathroom. Fortunately, she pretended not to notice and quietly returned to her room. They opened the safe, stuffed every bundle of cash into their bags. Everything was going perfectly until they turned to leave and came face to face with the mayor. Startled, they raised their hands. The mayor yanked off his mask. Someone rushed forward to stop him, but the mayor shot him instantly. Another teammate panicked and fired back, killing the mayor. They grabbed the money and bolted. But the moment they climbed into the getaway car, another mysterious figure blocked their path.

But what she never imagined was this. The day before the trial, the killer's attorney appeared right at her doorstep. He pulled out $60,000 from his briefcase, trying to buy Riley's silence and convince her to drop the charges against the three men who wiped out her family. That attempt ignited the fury she had buried deep inside. She snapped, unleashing a storm of curses at the lawyer and his whole bloodline. But then the sharp eyed attorney noticed the bottles of medication Riley used to keep her mental state barely afloat. Those small, ordinary looking pills became the core of his countertech. When the trial began, a lawyer flipped the entire case upside down, claiming Riley was mentally unstable and accusing her of framing three innocent men. The stunt left the courtroom frozen in disbelief. And even more outrageous, the judge actually accepted the argument. To make matters worse, none of the local prosecutors stood up for Riley, the victim who had lost everything ever since witnessing her family being gunned down. Riley relied on those medications to fight crippling insomnia. But now those same pills were used as weapons against her, proof that she was unfit and unstable. It was then Riley understood everyone in that courtroom was tied to the killers in some shadowy way. And that realization only hardened her resolve. For vengeance, she swore every one of them would pay. But the situation turned even darker. The people in that courtroom intended to send her to a horrifying mental institution, convinced she had lost her mind. Just as the vehicle door was about to close, Riley spotted an oxygen tank nearby. Barefoot, she sprinted for half an hour and somehow broke free from their grasp. From that day on, Riley vanished without a trace. Five years later, police found three bodies that had fallen from a Ferris wheel, each face twisted as if they had endured unspeakable torture. And soon they discovered these three victims were the very same men who had slaughtered Riley's entire family.

The moment he stepped onto campus, he noticed the upperclassmen bullying the younger students. But when Jack appeared, everything changed. The bullies went quiet the instant they saw him. Everyone was terrified of Jack because at his previous school, he had killed someone. No one dared to mess with him. Jack entered the classroom. The room fell silent. He walked straight to his seat and lowered his head. Suddenly, the class nerd accidentally bumped into him. Jack glared at him furious. The nerd quickly apologized. Hearing this, Jack closed his eyes and went back to sleep. A nerd sighed in relief and got back to his work. His job was to deliver lunch to the upperclassmen every day, but that wasn't all. He also stole other students phones and handed them over to his boss, Alex. One day, Alex noticed there were fewer phones than before. He demanded to see the list. As he scanned the names, he stopped at 1 and asked, who's this guy? The nerd answered nervously, he's the new kid. He's scary. I didn't want to mess with him. Hearing this, Alex became furious and started beating the nerd while shouting, I want his phone now. Terrified, the nerd had no choice but to agree. He ran to the teacher's office and said, I'm here to collect the phones. The principal didn't suspect a thing and handed him a bag. Full of phones. The nerd rushed to the bathroom, hesitating for a moment. He was terrified of Jack, but still he stole Jack's phone. Later, he went back to class and started returning the phones to the students. When Jack reached out for his phone, he realized it was missing. He looked at the nerd and asked, where's my phone? It's in the bag, the nerd stammered. It's not, Jack said coldly. The nerd tried to act innocent. I just picked them up from the teacher's office. Then Jack noticed the bruises on the nerd's mouth. At that moment, he understood everything. Jack stood up and walked out of the classroom. The nerd panicked and chased after him, calling out, I'm sorry about your phone. If you want, I'll buy you a new one. But Jack quietly said, I already know. Then he left. The nerd stood there frozen, regret flooding his face. The next day when Jack arrived at school, he saw Alex beating the nerd again. That sight triggered something inside him, memories of when he had been bullied, helpless and alone. Suddenly, a dangerous thought formed in his mind.

Determined not to let his wife's plot succeed, he clutched his abdomen in unbearable agony, dragged himself toward the balcony and prepared to jump, hoping she would spend the rest of her life buried in guilt. Although the wife now pretended to be remorseful, the man had no intention of forgiving her. He leaped without a second thought.

But as I dove underwater to look for it, I stumbled upon a mysterious stone. As an experienced treasure hunter, I immediately recognized it as a Alice stone used on ancient ships. These stones are usually found near sunken ships that contain treasure. So I surfaced quickly and informed my team about the discovery. Upon hearing this, they grabbed their weapons and dove into the water to search. Soon, I made another discovery. It wasn't until I pried it loose that I realized it was a golden dagger hundreds of years old. Finding such a precious artifact filled me with immediate excitement. Now all, all we had to do was find the sunken treasure and we would become billionaires. To speed up our search, we went to the market and bought a lot of detection equipment. Then we returned to the area of the sea. We first marked the approximate location with ropes, then carefully began searching with a metal detector. It wasn't long before the detector gave us signal to investigate. I quickly told my companion to use a hair dryer to blow the sand away from the surface. Soon, a thick iron chain appeared before us. Realizing there was a major treasure underneath, I quickly instructed my companion to increase the hair dryer's power. And as the sand was blown aside, the big treasure below finally revealed itself. Turned out to be an ancient cannon buried there for Hundreds of years to move this heavy object. We quickly tied ropes to both sides of the cannon and filled the airbags with fresh air. Together, we lifted it with all our strength and slowly the cannon began to float. Just as we were about to transport the cannon onto the ship, our teammate Lisa suddenly heard an alarm. It was the time for the Coast Guard's routine inspection. The news sent a chill through us underwater because we knew that if we brought the cannon up, the treasure beneath would also be exposed and it would be seized by the authorities, leaving us with nothing to prevent this from happening. Quickly signaled my companion to release some air, temporarily stabilizing the cannon underwater. But just as my companion opened the airbag to release air, accidentally let all the air out. In an instant, the several thousand pound cannon plunged uncontrollably toward the seabed and my companion's arm got tangled in the rope, dragging him down with it. As it hit the ground, the cannon landed squarely on my companion's arm. But what was even worse was that our oxygen supply was running dangerously low.

The next day, the boy's grandmother came to Alexander's house. She demanded an apology, but Alexander proudly boasted, my father will protect me. He told the grandmother to leave and tried to shut the door, but door wouldn't close properly. The grandmother forced it open, then began chanting some incantation. Suddenly, dark clouds covered the sky. Strong winds began to blow, scaring even Alexander. When he woke up the next morning, he found that his body had shrunk. Terrified, he ran out of the house and continued his usual bad behavior. But this time no one feared him. Even a dog barked at him and chased him down the street. The children he once bullied at school now surrounded him, ready to teach him a lesson. Even the prisoners deliberately cut his clothes.

Each one mastered a different skill. Some became world class hackers. Some could alter their appearance in seconds and a few could disguise themselves as women so convincingly you wouldn't know the difference. Wolf King stayed hidden, pulling every string from the shadows. A few days ago, his crew stole $2 billion in cryptocurrency without leaving a trace. The police still had no idea what Wolf King even looked like. That night, I suddenly caught his trail. To avoid alerting him, I sent a very plain looking officer named Mary to shadow him quietly and locate his residence. I monitored everything from my car through the live feed. Right then, Wolf King abruptly turned around. Mary instantly pretended to search for something on the ground. When he spotted her, he froze. This man's instincts were razor sharp. Everyone watching held their breath. But just as he started to walk away, Mary whispered into her hidden earpiece. I immediately ordered her to drop her hand. But Wolf King sensed something was wrong. As he made to leave again, a cop accidentally moved the surveillance camera. Wolf King noticed the tiny shift. My heart nearly stopped. Fortunately, he still wasn't completely sure he was being tailed, so Mary continued following him from afar. Eventually, she tracked him to an Old rundown building. She put on a pair of headphones to cover the earpiece in her ear and casually walked up beside him as if nothing was happening. At that moment, I felt something was off. I rewound the earlier footage and saw him turning around and studying Mary's face intently right then. That coming, Wolf King remembered seeing her earlier at the market. He had already identified her as a cop. After stepping inside the elevator, he quietly pulled out a knife.

Life was orderly, calm, almost too calm. Until one day, Adam turned 35 and his parents had grown frail and slow with age. One night, as the family slept soundly, a thunderous crash echoed from above.

He ignored the advice and even mocked the man for his job, while the janitor simply smiled and bent down to pick up the scattered butts. Ever heard of the rebound effect? The old man said calmly. Whatever you throw out will return to you a hundred times stronger. He thought the janitor was out of his mind and splashed his entire cup of coffee onto him.

The drone had been sent to eliminate, but now, without the tracker's signal, it it only wandered over the valley, searching blindly for its target. What the operators didn't realize was that their prey had already become the hunter. Two crisp shots rang out. Jimmy put the rifle away with calm certainty, knowing without even looking that the drone had been blown out of the sky. To keep headquarters from suspecting anything. He immediately removed the frying pan. Once the tracker signal returned, a second drone was dispatched to bomb his location. But Jimmy had planned ahead.

It turned out they had already buried themselves in each other's lives like two people trapped in a mudslide.

He tells the guy he needs to shoot his insulin, asks if he wants something to drink, and the other man trying to stay cool says, yeah, anything cold. Sounds amazing. They're acting tough, bragging they don't even bother with alcohol wipes, as if rough edges equal bravery. He jokes that even gangsters can keep things clean, but the room's tension says otherwise. Then the mood shift fast. Someone in the back tries to leave, but the man in charge shuts it down immediately. He wants him to stay, says they'll make it a 2 for 1. And suddenly no one is sure what that means. Visitor tries to excuse himself, says he can return later, but they block that escape before the thought even forms. He begs to just see the watches and go where he sees nothing, knows nothing, calls himself Stevie Wonder just to survive the moment. He repeats that he's never snitched in his life and promises he'll come back tomorrow. But the boss isn't buying it, so he starts explaining the watches, mumbling about perpetual motion mechanics, till someone interrupt with a threat sharp enough to freeze the room. A strip of tape shoved up a nose once is apparently enough warning for a lifetime. The man apologizes and the explanation continues. No batteries, just movement. But the visitor cracks, says he has an asylum case coming up, can't afford trouble, and decides he's just going to take one watch and wipe off Every fingerprint, like he Learned from CSI. Then he hears the question, want to know why that guy's here? He says no. But the, the story comes anyway. Months earlier, the man had a nasty dispute with a business partner's wife. Things spiraled and he ended up with a serious injury to his foot. He couldn't go to a hospital without raising flags. So he called this underground doctor, paid cash and let him stitch him up. The guy handed him codeine and told him he'd walk it off. But three weeks later, a real doctor was telling him they'd need to cut off his leg. And the reason? Because the underground medic completely botched the job. That's who he is. That's why he's here.

Jimmy tried to use a shovel to stir the water and speed up the reaction, but the shovel was too short and couldn't even touch the surface.

Worse still, the missile was now less than kilometer away. If it struck Jimmy, the nuclear charge would still go off. At that desperate moment, his teammates arrived in a helicopter.

What they didn't know, however, was that my real identity wasn't that of a regular teacher. I was a Navy seal operator. The class I've been assigned to, the most infamous one in the entire school. 20 teachers had already been scared away before me, but I believed I could get them back on track. The next day, I walked straight into the classroom. Good morning. This time, the students seemed a bit quieter, more subdued. But as class began, they still ignored me completely. Some were eating, others sleeping, and a few were even playing video games. I introduced myself, but no one cared. They thought I was just another pushover like all the teachers before me. What they didn't know was that I had a surprise waiting for them. I picked up a rubber band and a piece of chalk from the desk. In an instant, all of them were soaked. While I stood under an umbrella with a satisfied smile. Even though I gave them a solid lesson, they still had no interest in studying. To change that, I decided to give them a taste of freedom. I allowed them to smoke in class and announced that whoever could answer three of my questions correctly could leave immediately. I asked one of the students to hand me a pack of cigarettes. Then I asked them what ingredients were used to make cigarettes. Let me go. Stop yelling. I won't see you guys anymore. One of the students shouted, Tony answered all the questions correctly and under the jealous eyes of everyone else, walked out of the classroom. That sparked excitement. Everyone suddenly wanted to be the next one to leave. But the scene didn't go unnoticed. The principal watching from a distance, clearly wasn't happy about what was happening. I, however, didn't care. I kept teaching with my open, free spirited methods and continued explaining the components and dangers of tobacco. Gradually, the students began to enjoy my class. The next day, the student who loved smoking suddenly disappeared. I found out he had been working for a gang, so I went after him. The gang members were ruthless, violent fighters. When they saw I wasn't particularly tall or imposing, they told me to get out. But when I heard my student crying for help from inside and saw the fear in his eyes, I didn't hesitate for a second.

Incredibly tiny, he carefully placed her in his pocket and carried her home. He poured a bowl of warm milk and gently cleaned her tiny body. She twirled in the water, a smile returning to her miniature face. After her bath, he found a small box, lined it with a soft towel, and she curled up inside, completely content. In a quiet voice, she said she was hungry. He immediately brought her a plate of food. Every bite seemed like a massive cake to her, and she ate with delight, as if uncovering a hidden treasure. While the boy worked on his homework, the girl climbed the book and reached the tabletop. Exhausted, she fell asleep right there. He stroked her head with the tip of his finger and looking at her adorable little face, felt a gentle, unfamiliar warmth stir inside him. After he fell asleep, she opened her eyes and watched him silently, her heart glowing with warmth. She spent the whole night curled up on the table until morning arrived. The boy reminded her to stay hidden to make sure no one saw her. But as soon as he left, his mother came in to clean. Hearing footsteps, the girl froze in fear, darted from the table to the window sill, jump and hid behind a potted plant. After tidying up, his mother noticed the window was open. Felt the wind and simply closed it before leaving. The girl stepped out from behind the plan trying to get back, back inside, only to realize the window was shut. Trapped outside. When the boy returned from school, he found her shivering in the cold. He opened the window immediately holding her tight. Luckily, she didn't get sick to make.

The same time, a massive tree toppled over and the cargo truck couldn't swerve in time, heading straight toward a cliff, only for that fallen tree to transform into a whole pack of tanuki as well. The next morning when the tanuki saw the accidents reported on TV, they were thrilled and even through a Celebration party. All of this happened because humans kept expanding into the forest, shrinking the tanuki's home day by day. Desperate, the tanuki banded together to stop humans from wiping out their habitat. But just as they were celebrating their first success, the news announced that the accident wouldn't slow down the development at all. So the tanuki decided to change tactics. They needed humans to fear this forest. When the developers prayed to the mountain god, the tanuki transformed into legendary fox spirits, scaring the developers so badly they dropped to their knees begging for mercy. Not stopping there, the tanuki turned into two little children, rushed into the workers dorm and unleashed complete chaos before turning into smoke and vanishing on the spot. This sent the workers into full panic and the next day every single one of them packed up and left. But before the tanuki could even celebrate, the developers hired a new batch of higher paid workers. Even when the tanuki repeated the same trick to frighten them, fresh group would always show up the next morning. Slowly, the tanuki began to lose their fighting spirit. As winter approached, they had to gorge themselves just to store enough energy to survive the cold. Fortunately, the winter chill halted all construction, giving the tanuki a brief moment of peace. When spring returned, the tanuki had a baby boom. But with the population exploding, food in the forest grew scare. And with humans restarting construction, their living space shrank even further. To feed their young, the tanuki with transformation skills took human form and scavenged through trash bins, while the ones who couldn't transform sneaked into human houses to steal food. And every time they ventured out, some were hit by passing cars. Others couldn't resist bait and were caught by hunters who skinned them for their fur. How were these tanuki supposed to survive?

What they didn't know, however, was that his true identity was that of a Navy SEAL operator, and the class he had been assigned to was the most notorious one in the entire school. They had already driven 20 teachers away before him, but he was confident he could get them back on track. The next day, he walked straight into the classroom. Good morning, he said. This time, the students seemed a little calmer, but during the lesson, they still completely ignored him. Some were eating, some were sleeping, and some were even playing video games. He introduced himself, but no one took any notice. They thought he would be just as weak as the teachers who came before him. But what they didn't know was that he had a surprise in store for them. He picked up a rubber band and a piece of chalk from the desk. In an instant, they were all drenched, while he stood under an umbrella, grinning with satisfaction. Go ahead. Welcome to my class. Even after giving them a solid lesson, they still showed no interest in studying. To shake things up, he first allowed them to smoke in class and announced that anyone who could answer three of his questions correctly could leave immediately. He asked one student to hand him a pack of cigarettes. Then Asked the class what ingredients were used to make cigarettes. They might go wrong. They might fail. Do you know it? See you later, Tom. I got your dad, John. Tony. Tony answered all the questions correctly and walked out of the room under the jealous gazes of everyone else.

Even after years of surviving on meager ration, the lucky ones here could still enjoy steak paired with red wine. And all of this was thanks to one bearded man. On the day the apocalypse, everyone was fleeing their homes. He was the only one hiding in his bunker fully prepared. Only after the streets were empty did he quietly push open the bunker door, rushing out fully armed. Once he confirmed no one was around, he removed his mask, revealing a satisfied smile. Knew there was no time to rest. First he drove to his neighbor's house to yacht onto a pickup, removed all the seat and drove straight to the gas station. While power still flowed, filled every single oil drum, then drove to the gas company, opening the pipeline leading home neck. He stormed the hardware store grabbing tools of every kind, conditioning hoses. The power cut came swiftly. For him, it was no obstacle. A massive generator was already set up in his backyard. All he had to do was connect to the gas line, press the switch gently and a deafening roar erupted instantly. Step by step, he built fortification. First, an electric fence encircled nearby houses. Then he cleared the trees around it, creating an open field of vision. Finally, he buried dozens of flame jets. The basic defense was ready at last. He stockpiled food, cultivated a small vegetable garden. Set up a chicken coop and built a cold storage for meat. The post apocalypse Utopia was complete. In the days that followed, apart from venturing out for supplies, Bill spent his time watching mutants fall into his trap. And so.

The rival was furious and the two ended up rolling on the floor, fighting over a single pork leg. Only when the head judge intervened did the man finally stop. But when they started chopping ingredients, he noticed his rival was carving delicately, so he immediately created loud noises beside him. Sure enough, the rival was thrown off.

Jack kept piles of gold jewelry stacked in the bedroom and the living room was overflowing with suitcases stuff with cash. Whenever his wife Judy looked for a pair of shoes, she spent forever searching because every shoebox in the house was packed with money. And every single day, Jack dragged home more bags filled with cash. Soon the house didn't even have a corner left to store it. One day, a mountain of cash bag tumbled out of the closet and almost crushed him. So Jack built a stable just to stash more money. But that space filled up just as fast. With nowhere else to hide it, he began digging holes in the yard to bury the cash. But after some time, whenever he dug a new hole, the previously buried bags would start pushing their way back up. Jack had no options left. He was forced to start depositing the money in bank. Because of him, more than a dozen banks opened across the town and each one emptied its vault just to make room for Jack's money. Eventually, Jack deposited billions of dollars in every bank he could find. His next goal was to bring all that cash out legally. So Jack created a swarm of and appointed poor and elderly people as their CEO. Even then, he still couldn't withdraw money nearly as quickly as he collected it. Everyone in town knew Most of Jack's fortune was dirty money, but not a single officer tried to arrest him. Instead, several government agencies stepped in to help him because the truth was Jack used to be just an ordinary pilot, earning barely enough to get by. To make extra cash, he started smuggling a special type of cigarette. The agencies discovered everything, but they didn't arrest him. They pressured him because Jack was an exceptionally skilled pilot and they needed his ability. They wanted Jack to fly low over the dense jungle and pick up the girl.

The pharmacist explained that it was a muscle relaxant for dog, and everything became clear. Her mother had kept her paralyzed to keep her in the wheelchair. Just then, a frantic mother burst into the pharmacy shouting her name. Daisy gasped for air, unable to speak a word. As her mother rushed toward her, Daisy pleaded with her eyes at the pharmacist, shaking her head, but he didn't understand her silent plea for help.

But unfortunately, the man standing before them was a high risk criminal who had stayed hidden for 30 long years. Cruel, calculating and brutally cold. Jackie pretended to be the girl's strict father, scolding her for secretly dating boys, and then seized the moment while pressing the elevator button to flick a tiny listening device outside. He asked the man which floor he lived on, but the suspect was razor sharp and said nothing, only insisting on escorting them himself. To lower the man's guard, Jackie acted as if they were simply chatting, then pulled out a few apples he had prepared ahead of time to share. Around. Each apple carried a miniature camera. He offered one to the man, but the man refused without hesitation. So Jackie spit out the apple peel with the hidden cam onto the corner of the elevator. From that angle, the device captured the man's face with perfect clarity. The man, code named shadow, was an elite assassin skilled in close quarters combat. Fifteen days earlier, he had LED a crew that stole 15 million in cash from a currency exchange office. Following the trail, police concluded he was the mastermind and assigned Jackie, one of their most seasoned operatives, to bring him in. Soon the elevator reached the top floor. Jackie stepped out with the girl, but shadow stayed alert, watching them. From the window, Jackie activated a hidden tool in his glasses, signed the girl to shield him with her back, and quietly unlocked the room door. Only after seeing them both walk inside did shadow finally turn away. When he reentered the elevator, the concealed camera recorded him pressing the button for the eighth floor. The officers who had been waiting immediately rushed to that level, filled the hallway with surveillance gear and kept their eyes on Shadow's every move. From that moment on, shadow was completely within police control.

When a federal marshal tried to stop him, he was no match for him. The aircraft made an emergency landing in a remote valley and a brutal brawl broke out between the prisoners and the marshals. While everyone was distracted by the fight, he seized the moment, slipping into a dead Marshall's uniform and pretending to be blind from the attack. Soon, local police arrived for backup. They rescued him and asked what happened on the plane. This was his perfect chance to boast. Calmly, he told them about a special prisoner on board, hooded, who used to be an undercover cop. He had infiltrated criminal circles, gathered intelligence and reported back. But that same cop had turned, becoming a full fledged criminal. Upon hearing this, the sheriff understood the gravity of the situation and immediately began searching for the prisoner. He was sent to the hospital and the sheriff even had his wife look after him. But before long, the sheriff received new information.

He knew that being just another cog in the wheel would never lead to success. He gathered the courage to approach his employer and asked how one might truly get rich. The farmer, not refusing the question, sat him down and began to share his own story of success. He explained that success is not just about hard work, but about becoming a leader within your circle. Red, determined to change his fate, asked, if I finish the job tomorrow, could you give me a part of the savings? The farmer laughed, you're ambitious, I'll give you that. But there's no way you're finishing tomorrow. The next morning, his co workers were shocked to find that red hadn't shown up at dawn. They assumed he had run away.

She took a small bite, then carefully placed the rest on a plate just to snap the perfect social media photo. Her post quickly attracted five star reviews, and Luna felt a strange sense of satisfaction. But behind this fleeting joy lay the harsh truth of a fake world. In this world, ratings decided everything. Those with high scores enjoyed power, respect, and opportunities, while those with low scores were stuck in menial jobs. Those with no score were sent to prison. Luna knew if she didn't raise her score, she would be left behind. So she started looking for ways to boost her rating, whether it was giving others high marks or flattering them just to get something in return. One day, Luna met a highly rated woman in an elevator. She quickly checked her profile, then started complimenting her, hoping for a high score in return. The woman gave her four stars, and Luna was thrilled. But then Luna realized, could this fake rating system really lead to the life she wanted? She began to wonder. Behind every high score, there might be a deeper secret. Could ratings truly change her life? Or was she just sinking deeper into a cycle of vanity?

But she had no idea that in the very next second the monster was about to eat that same half cucumber. Just then, a kind hearted old giant swiftly grabbed the cucumber and lied saying this cucumber has gone bad. It's full of worm. Hearing this, the monster got scared that it might upset his stomach so he threw the cucumber away. Then in anger, he picked up a glass of chlorine water from the table and slowly walked off. The girl crawled out of the cucumber, but her entire body was covered in sticky juice. The old giant gently picked her up, took her under a large tap and carefully washed her off. Then he placed her clothes near the fire to dry. The old giant wanted to send her back to the human world, but it wasn't easy. He was the smallest among all the giants, so the others often bullied him. That that's why when all the giants were taking their afternoon nap, he quietly sneaked out with the girl. He walked very cautiously, but a watchful giant spotted him and beg and to harass him. Thankfully, the girl was hidden inside a blanket so no one could see her. She quickly ran and hid inside an old car. Meanwhile, the giant continued bullying the old one, tossing him around as if he were a ball. And a huge and heavy giant forced Him into a truck.

Ten minutes passed but the water showed no signs of solidifying. The missile grew ever closer. Jimmy determined to help, grabbed a shovel and began stirring the water hoping to speed up process. But the shovel was too short and it couldn't even reach the surface of the water. There was no time to find a longer tool. In a split second decision, Jimmy jumped into the water and started stirring the coagulant with his hand. Plans seemed to work. Slowly the water began to solidify, but it was more like quicksand and it quickly trapped Jimmy inside. No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn't break.

When customers asked for toilet paper, the waiter threw two towels on top of them, but those towels were even dirtier than the rag. The worst part was that there were cockroaches in the duck soup.

The customer got furious and grabbed the bowl of soup, ready to make the manager taste it. But fortunately, the chef poured oil on the floor just in time. The customer slipped, the bowl broke, and all evidence disappeared. That's how the Roast Duck Shop avoided trouble once again, because customers kept coming back, despite how disgusting the place was. It was because the manager had a secret recipe for roast duck that was so good people couldn't help but lick their fingers. The manager was extremely greedy, making the employees work for free.

But immediately after shaking his hand, the millionaire openly sanitized his hands with alcohol multiple times. Though somewhat embarrassed, the man mustered his courage with hope. He proposed his idea of starting a low cost airline so that the poor could also enjoy air travel. However, this simple yet noble dream was harshly rejected by the millionaire. The millionaire declared that airplanes were built only for the rich. Not only did he refuse to invest, he also ordered his bodyguards to move the man to the economy section. This humiliating act infuriated Mara, who stated that he had purchased a first class ticket and had every right to stay there. The millionaire whispered a few words into a flight attendant's ear. Soon after, an announcement declared that the plane would be turning back. As dusk fell, Mara was escorted off the plane in the most humiliating manner. As he stepped out of the cabin, an elegant man in a gray suit stopped him. His name was Babu, a venture capitalist. He had overheard Mara's innovative idea for a low cost airline in the cabin. But before investing, he needed Mara to convince him with solid arguments. To explain his vision more clearly, Mara took him to a small street side restaurant. Initially, Babu disliked the noise and atmosphere.

However, the wife thought the sweater looked too small and asked him to stand up and turn around. When he refused, she began to grow worried. Suddenly, the man froze. No matter how much she called out, he didn't respond. Only then did she realize that the network signal was bad, so she hung up the phone. In reality, the pattern on the back of the sweater hadn't been finished yet. A while later, sensing something was off, the wife video called him again. Suddenly, a wig fell onto his face. The wife instantly noticed the strange situation and was about to question him, but the the man froze again, completely motionless. The villagers behind him held their breath in silent, thinking it was another network issue. The wife walked around the house looking for a signal. After several failed attempts, she finally hung up the phone. At that moment, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. It turned out that the husband had lied to his wife, telling her he was studying art in a big city, but in reality, he was teaching in a remote Mountain Village. Every time his wife called, he pretended to be in a city landmark, relying entirely on the villagers to cover up the truth. One day, while visiting a newly opened resort, the wife caught sight of a notice board at the Entrance of the village partially covered by something. Driven by curiosity, she lifted the cover and was shocked to see her husband's photo on it. She stood still in place, then went straight to his workplace. When the villagers saw her, they were terrified. One person hurriedly put on a wig as a disguise, while another tried to secretly pass a message to the husband, only to be caught by the wife on the spot. Looking around, she could hardly believe her eyes. This entire situation was a carefully orchestrated setup by her husband.

As she was about to show him how to shift gears, her hand slipped and accidentally touched Leo instead of the gearstick. Feeling the warmth of Luna's palm, Leo seemed to understand what had happened. Without hesitation, he pressed the brake, hoping Luna would carefully study the gears. It was something he had been dreaming of for a long time. Ever since Leo played the cello for the first time, he had left a lasting impression on teacher Luna. After that, they often exchanged glances in class as if they could read each other's thoughts.

After finishing her cleaning, the mother noticed the window was open, the wind blowing through. She closed it and left the room.

But unfortunately the 80 year old rich granny is still alive today. And I've been living this simple and boring life for 25 years. When I was 10, my dad worked day and night. And one day while driving past our house, he crashed into it from falling asleep at the wheel. After my dad passed away, life at home got even harder. That incident made me understand something about life. Working hard doesn't always lead to good results. Taking shortcuts is the safest way. Ten years passed quickly and I kept working toward my dream. I hung around all kinds of high end clubs every day. And on my 20th birthday I finally found the target I've been looking for. From my buddy I Learned the rich lady was 55 this year. She had just divorced and had no kids. And most importantly, she owned the biggest supermarket chain in the entire country. Her assets were too many to count. I got excited the moment I heard it. Old but loaded. And her health wasn't great. She was literally the woman of my dreams. Without hesitation I jumped straight into the pool, then swam over to her to show off my strong body. Oh, I think I'm making you wet. And just like that, I married into a wealthy family. 25 years passed in the blink of an eye. Today was our wedding anniversary. She Gave me another one million dollar watch. It wasn't expensive, but I still had to pretend to be happy.

Instead of scolding the boy, he bought the bread and handed it over to him. The boy crouched down and devoured the bread hungrily. John felt a wave of compassion. He took the boy to the seaside to bathe. When he saw the boy's emaciated body covered in bruises, he made the decision to take him in. That night, they slept in John's car, but the next morning, the boy was gone. He had stolen all of John's money, his last saving. What hurt John the most wasn't the loss of money, but the betrayal of his kindness. Overcome with emotion, he suffered a heart attack. His dog, happy, came to his side and reminded him it was time for his medication. In this world, perhaps a dog understands gratitude better than people. With no savings left, he became truly homeless. It wasn't that he didn't want to go home, but he no longer had one to return to. Not long ago, he had been laid off from the factory he'd worked at for years. Losing his job in middle age meant he had no chance in the job market anymore. He searched for work for a long time, but no company was willing to hire him. But as life often goes, he was diagnosed with heart disease. He was still unsure whether to tell his wife, but She had already handed him the divorce papers. In that moment, he was completely broken. So he packed up his few belongings, took his dog and set off on his final journey. After the boy had stolen his savings, John went to a secondhand shop, hoping to sell some old treasured items. Looking at the worthless item, the shopkeeper politely turned down. Disappointed, John returned to his car only to find happy curled up in a corner, clearly in pain. John immediately took him into his arm.

Sniffing intently along the tailgate, the border officer caught the red flag, instantly motioning for backup. Before the smugglers could resist, sweat team swarmed and neutralized the threat.

To maintain the steady flow of pension checks funding his gambling addiction, he resolved to conceal the corpse. Macop solution he devised was in tuming the body within the bathroom walls. He visited a home improvement center, seeking identical ceramic tiles. To avoid raising suspicion, he listed a derelict warehouse as the delivery point. Under cover of darkness, he'd load tiles into his attache case, faring them home through multiple trips.

Ever since he was young, couldn't stand this brutal way of romance. Even when his mother personally taught him how to swing a club. He believed affection should be earned with sincerity, not force. But because of that, he got rejected again and again. Years passed and he grew up at the river. He'd get pinched by crab. He'd try spearing a fish only to launch the spear straight into the sky.

He had a crush on Lisa since childhood, yet he never bring himself to actually hit her with a club. So he tried his own method. He built a vine bicycle to take her for a ride.

To prolong the torment, the tribesmen shoved bamboo tubes into him, letting the flames crawl over his body, stretching out their cruel entertainment. A second poacher was tied to the ground, while a venomous snake was tossed in front of him. It hesitated at first, but startled by the nearby fire, it slithered straight toward the man. Watching this, John's heart raced, feared he would be next. Soon, John was dragged to the hunting ground. The chief let an arrow fly and then unexpectedly released it. The farther John ran, the more frenzied the tribesmen became. But once he passed where the arrow had landed, a warrior took off after him. Though John was strong, the heat sapped his energy. In less than ten seconds, the warrior closed the distance. Seeing John falter, the warrior hurled a spear in mist. Frustrated, he drew a magic charge. But John quickly overpowered him, snatching his gear before sprinting away. More warriors arrived and saw what had happened. They gave chase, but not far into the pursuit, one suddenly collapsed, clutching his chest. A heart attack. John seized the moment, vanishing into the woods. There, he crafted makeshift sandals from grass. He spotted a giant snail, cracked its shell and devoured it. Just then, a third warrior crept up. Luckily, John noticed in time and bolted. Along the way, he passed a cactus. An idea spark pierced it, letting the milky sap seep out. The warrior saw the sap and found one of John's discarded sandals. He guessed John was nearby, but John had already circled behind him. One precise strike and the warrior went down. Three days passed without proper food. John knew he had to hunt. He hurled his spear.

Every time she saw couples showing affection on TV, her eyes burned with envy. She would turn off the screen in frustration, knowing the truth, no one could ever embrace a mouth like hers. Since birth, she had been the subject of ridicule. Even posting a simple selfie would get flagged, removed, condemned. This had carved deep insecurity into her soul. Kept a secret diary, a sanctuary where she collected images of perfect lips. Sometimes she would tear a poster apart, pressing the flawless lips onto her own face, imagining a reflection she would never have. On her 20th birthday, she finally mustered the courage to eat out. But when the waiter caught sight of her, he laughed uncontrollably. She had grown accustomed to such reaction. Calmly, she pulled a funnel from her bag, slid the tube into her pants, and poured the food through it, letting it flow directly to her stomach. She finished quickly, preparing to leave, when a gang of thugs ambushed her. They snatched her utensils, tossed her treasured notebook to the ground, and even tried to snap photos for the internet. Rage surged through her. She clutched her bag, kicked one attacker aside, and sprinted to her car. Tears streamed down her face as she drove. Suddenly, a deafening crash shattered the night. Panic. She looked out and realized she had struck a boy. Strangely, he grinned, a look of Satisfaction on his face. Perhaps he liked her. What did the world make of that

Inside lay a species neither had ever seen before. Jenny suspected it might be a prank from a colleague. Let's try an electric pulse, she suggested, aiming to study the worm like creature. The current steadily increased, but the worm remained motionless. Both scientists leaned in, eyes glued to the computer screen, unaware that the creature had quietly come to life. In the next instant, anchor let out a piercing shriek. The insect had crawled up her pant leg. She flailed, trying desperately to subdue it. Timid, Jenny froze. She couldn't bring herself to help. In a sudden panic decision, she opened the door and locked anchor inside the lab. Anchor's behavior shifted instantly. Her eyes were wild, almost unrecognizable. She tore at her clothes, touching her body as if possessed. Jenny trembled behind the glass, and then anchor began walking toward the door.

Frozen with shock, he was questioned mercilessly, even accused of involvement in a car incident from days earlier. Fear gripped him as he tried to explain, but they refused to listen and tried to drag him to the station. Then, through the window, his mother saw everything. She ran down, furious, confronting the officers. When they demanded identification, she flashed her own ID and the absurdity of it all hit. He was being arrested just for taking out the garbage. Speechless, the officers finally paused as his mother declared him a college basketball player. Only then did they release him. The shock lingered, but his resolve remained unshaken.

Everything I did was just clumsy imitation. I couldn't even understand a traffic light. And in the next second, a car slammed right into me. The driver, Lucy, nearly screamed in terror. I calmly stood back up, though my leg was twisted in an unnatural shape. Before she could call the police, I vanished into the crowd, limping toward a quiet alley. Then right next to my ear, a small panel opened on my skin. A rope dropped down and a tiny alien climbed out. Mole, our internal technician. You see, beneath this human exterior lies an incredibly complex control system, a biomechanical shell covering every limb and segment. My name is David, and our mission on earth is simple, to gather water using a spherical extraction device designed for planetary harvest.

The answer chilled him. A father just being released from prison that very day, of all days, it had to be today, felt the unease creep in.

Out on the street, chaos had already taken over. People were fleeing in every direction. He had no idea what was unfolding, but instinct told him to get his family out before it was too late. Midway down the road, the same neighbors who had just fled came racing back at full speed, making the whole situation feel even more unreal. A traffic jam forced their car to a halt. And that's when he finally saw it. The only road leading out of town was sealed off by the military. Helicopters hovered overhead, airlifting civilian. A broadcast boomed over loudspeakers urging everyone to return home. Some residents obeyed and began turning back. He and his wife exchanged a confused look, assuming it was just another emergency lockdown. Suddenly, a rock slammed onto their hood. He glanced upward. Dust was erupting from the cliff above. Mom, is it an earthquake? No, sweetheart, it can't be. A thunderous roar drowned out her voice as two fighter jets screamed toward the town. Before he could process what was happening, the jets released their payload. He froze. If they had followed the broadcast and returned home, they would have been vaporized. A massive cloud of smoke engulfed the entire town. No one inside could have survived the blast. And worse, after Completing their strike, the jets banked sharply, heading straight for them. Only then did he understand what the military was trying to do.

She believed that as long as the scene looked like a suicide, everyone would accept it without question. After sending her sister into the abyss, she quickly pulled out her phone and recorded a farewell video. Pretending to tremble, she said, if you ever find a body near my home, just know it's me. Once she finished, she attempted to upload the footage online. But just as the upload was nearly complete, she suddenly froze. A severed leg lay at the edge of the cliff, propped neatly against a rock. When she got closer, she realized it was a prosthetic. Her sister's real body was lying motionless at the bottom of the ravine. Only then did she remember her sister had been disabled all her life. The identity she had been imitating with such effort instantly became useless. She panicked as she recalled the video still uploading. Fortunately, the signal in the area was weak. She quickly switched her phone to airplane mode. Rushing downhill, she muttered, no, you can't replace me. People will know you're not me. She desperately searched for a way to fix the situation. Then she noticed a railway track nearby, the train thundering toward it. Looking at her own healthy legs, a dangerous thought struck her. If she placed the prosthetic on the track and let the train destroy it, it would appear her sister had no disability. With that evidence, no one would doubt the story. She carefully set the fake leg in the middle of the track, then hid behind a rock, holding her breath as she waited for the roar of steel.

By the time they realized how bad things were, the earth beneath their home had collapsed into a massive sinkhole. Totally unaware of the danger, Marge was getting ready to drive the kids to school. Bart was ecstatic. He smelled a chance to skip class. But Marge wasn't about to give him that victory.

News crews swarmed the scene and within hours the government rolled out an official solution, fill the sinkhole with whatever trash they could find before it grew any bigger. In the chaos, Marge's car got swallowed by the garbage heap. With the compensation money the city handed out, she purchased a shiny high tech replacement. But from the moment she sat inside, she sensed something strange, a weird odor no one else seemed to notice. I don't smell anything. Me neither. But the scent bothered her more by the minute. Trying to help, Homer grabbed a handful of gas station hot dogs to fix the smell, then lit a Cigarette on top of it, his idea of deodorizing. Marge still insisted something wasn't right, so they took the car to a mechanic. After a full checkup, the verdict was simple, nothing's wrong with it. But deep down, Marge knew this wasn't just about a smell, and the story was far from over.

But unfortunately for him, the 80 year old wealthy grandma is still breathing just fine today. And he has been stuck in this dull, suffocating life for 25 long years. When he was ten, his father worked himself to exhaustion day and night. One evening, while driving past their home, the man dozed off behind the wheel and crashed straight into the house. After his father's death, things only got tougher. And that tragedy taught him a cruel truth. Hard work doesn't guarantee anything. Sometimes shortcuts are the safest path. A decade slipped by and he kept chasing the future he wanted. He hung around fancy VIP clubs every single day. And on his 20th birthday, he finally spotted the perfect target. A buddy told him the wealthy woman was 55, recently divorced and had no children. Most importantly, she owned the biggest supermarket empire in the country. Her fortune was practically endless. Second he heard that, excitement shot through him. Sure, she was older, but she was rich beyond imagination. And her health wasn't exactly ideal. The dream combination in his eyes. Without hesitation, he made his move.

She was preparing an escape. With a swift snap, she broke a steel saw blade in half and buried the pieces deep inside a pile of ground beef. After kneading it thoroughly, she wrapped the meat tight in plastic and left it to freeze overnight. The next morning at work, she casually slipped the frozen package to an inmate through a guard she happened to be friendly with. Mike didn't flinch. He unwrapped the package right under the guard's nose. Just be nothing more. Satisfied, the guard walked away. But the moment the coast was clear, Mike rushed to the sink, thawed the frozen meat under running water, and pulled out the saw blades hidden within. The escape had officially begun. Next, he tore toilet paper into strips, broke open an entire box of matches, wrapped them tight, and stuffed the makeshift fire bomb into an empty instant noodle bag. And he headed to the common area and signaled his partner on the upper floor as they passed each other on the stairs. The handoff was clean. Minutes later, while everyone else was distracted with activities, the accomplice slipped back to the cell and quietly lit a fire in the room next to Mike's. By the time the flames spread, the alarm was screaming through the block, and guards rushed in to extinguish the blaze. The wall was scorched black and would need repainting. Exactly as Mike planned. Back in the cell, Mike passed the saw fragments to John, the team's craftsmen. John wrapped cloth around both ends, snapped the blade again, then used a nail clipper, a rubber band, and layers of cloth to fashion two crude but effective saw handles. In minutes, two escape tools were ready. During the day, while most inmates were outside, the duo went to work. One posed as the guy repainting the smoke damaged wall, keeping watch, while the other slipped inside the empty cell, sawing through the ventilation grid inch by inch. Mike had even figured out in advance how to gather the falling metal dust without leaving a trace.

Doctors once use their hands to help patients with hysteria relax. But due to the heavy workload, their hands would often experience spasms. Moreover, the patients they treated didn't improve. Instead, they became more agitated and excited. To improve efficiency, Mortimer invented a machine that could replace human hands. He called in a severe case patient to test the machine's effectiveness. The woman lay on a chair, lifting her feet and covering herself with a blanket. Since this was the first time using the machine, Mortimer wasn't sure of the appropriate speed. He turned it up to the maximum and the woman screamed loudly, her cries echoing through the building. Just when Mortimer thought the experiment had failed, the woman expressed immense satisfaction. After the successful test, Mortimer went to the hospital director to present his invention. He predicted that the machine would make a lot of money in the future and asked for investment. However, the director didn't believe him. After all, he had worked in this field for years and couldn't accept something new. The director then brought in another severe case patient and told Mortimer to treat her. This woman was a soprano singer, and the more successful the treatment, the more beautiful her singing would become.

My wife rushed into the living room and when the lights flickered on, I saw the stranger I had shot, blood pouring from his eye. My hands were still trembling when the police arrived moments later. The sheriff quickly identified the intruder as a wanted criminal named Freddy. He reassured me saying it was clearly self defense and close the case. I just needed to head to the station to give my statement. Sitting in the back of the police car, I could hardly believe I had actually killed someone. When I got home, my wife and I collapsed on the floor, staring at the blood splattered on the wall. We had no idea what to do. Eventually we started cleaning up the mess and by morning the whole town had heard what had happened. The sheriff told me the intruder would be buried the next day. But I couldn't stop wondering, did he have any family? The sheriff mentioned he had a father who was serving time in prison. But here's the kicker. His father was being released today. Shit. Talk about like father, like son. And that's when I started to feel uneasy. Worried about potential retaliation from this criminal's father. I had all the locks on our doors replaced with heavy duty ones.

But as the guard entered the cell, he immediately spotted Tessek in the corner. Though this earned him a slap across the face, victorious smile spread across his face, proving his theory had been correct. He then began training in free climbing. The next day, when the guard returned for inspection, Tessek vanished from the cell once again. Only after the guard turned his back did he realize Tessek had scaled the wall. This enraged the guard, resulting in another brutal beating. Yet Tessek refused to give up. Theoretically, achieving invisibility meant perfecting his footwork to the extreme, allowing him to vanish from the guard's sight entirely. So when the guard returned for his next inspection, Tsek became more cunning. He mimicked the guards every step. Unexpectedly, this tactic worked.

Instead, he would sneak into people's homes every day, brushing his teeth with their toothbrushes, showering in their bathrooms. Strangely, he managed to live undetected for years, thanks to his unique squatting method. He'd ride his motorcycle through the streets, posting flyers on doorways. If a flyer remained untouched for three days, it meant the house was empty. Then he'd slip inside with his lock picking tools, check the landline voicemail, listening for the owner's whereabouts in return times. Once he had these details, he'd stay in the house for a few days. But he didn't just reload. He would clean the house for the owners, wash their dirty laundry before leaving. He even took photos with the family. And this parasitic lifestyle gave him a strange sense of accomplishment. One day, Tessek moved into another new place. But what he never expected was that the homeowner was actually at home and had discovered the intruder. Strangely, she didn't make a sound.

She rolled every wrapper 15 times until it became large, paper thin and nearly transparent. But when she returned to the market the next day, still no one bought a single dumpling. The stall beside hers was packed, while her booth stood completely empty. No matter how loud she shouted, no matter how hard she tried, no one stopped.

She asked her landlord to try them, but he shook his head, saying they still weren't as thin as the wonton skins locals love.

The taste was good, but if she wanted the wrappers thin like real Hong Kong wontons, she would need alkaline water. She went home and immediately tested it. She added an entire bowl of alkaline water into the dough. Sure enough, the skins became thinner and larger. But the moment she took a bite, she spat it out. Bitterness Was overwhelming. Then she noticed salt sitting on the table. She added it to the flour and slowly mixed in alkaline water in small amounts until the flavor balanced perfectly.

The gang leader froze for a moment. He remembered his own mother standing in front of him the exact same way. Moved by her courage, he ordered a bowl of dumplings. She didn't want to serve him, but she did. After finishing, he kept praising the taste and even ordered dumplings for all his men. From then on, he never bothered her again. He even lowered the Protection fee. Before leaving, he placed an order for 500 dumplings. She finally smiled. Not only was the danger gone, she had just gained her biggest customer. That same night, someone asked to buy frozen dumplings to take home. At first, she refused, afraid they'd spoil. But the customer mentioned they had a freezer and that single sentence sparked an idea. From that day forward, she sold fresh dumplings and frozen ones.

As it turns out, the needle was forged from meteorite iron, and its weight was staggering. A whopping 800 pounds. Her master ordered her to practice embroidery with this needle every single day. Only by doing so could she hope to master unparalleled martial art and claim the title at the National Martial Arts Championship. But the master still thought the weight wasn't enough. So she handed her an iron undershirt, insisting she wear it around the clock, never taking it off. She accepted it with gratitude, only to discover the garment was made from a rare special material and weighed a massive 3,000 pound. And so her hellish training regime began. On the day of the competition, the referee LED all contestants into the arena, none of them expecting her to be among the participants. She was the one they'd always look down on, the nobody from the lowest rung. But she didn't care about their judgments. She was determined to prove herself with her skills. The first to step into the ring was the guy who'd bullied her relentlessly for years. His martial arts skills were fearsome. He'd single handedly defeated every other contestant. Then he arrogantly taunted her, challenging her to a fight. But she quit.

Returning to this area of the sea, we first marked the approximate search zone with ropes, then carefully scanned with a metal detector. Didn't take long before the detector gave a signal. I immediately instructed my companion to use a hair dryer to blow away the surface sand. Soon a thick iron chain emerged. Realising a large treasure lay beneath, I quickly told my companion to increase the hair dryer's power. As the sand was blown aside, the massive treasure slowly came into view, an ancient cannon buried for hundreds of years. To move the old cannon, we quickly tied ropes to both sides. Of it.

He always slips past the security guard unnoticed. He reads newspapers without ever buying one. Even in the supermarket, he refuses to spend a single penny. He quietly drops two toothbrushes into a woman's bag, then places a small toy into a child's stroller. Next, he grabs a pair of shoes from the shelf and slips them into an old man's coat pocket. Even sticks a price tag into a salesman's hair. He's distributing items to random shoppers, creating chaos in the store. Only then does he begin his own shopping by picking the cheapest pack of chewing gum. The checkout counter. The customer in front of him is just about to leave when suddenly an alarm goes off. Then another, and another. One by one, all the security alarms start blaring. The sales girl comes to check, but strangely, every time she walks past him, the alarm buzzes again. Even though he has nothing with him, the supervisor is called. Eventually, they conclude that the alarm system must be malfunctioning. Anyone who paid is allowed to leave. But the moment this man walks out, all the alarms ring again. Still, the staff insist the system is broken. Just like that, he walks out with everything without spending a single coin. Later, he spots an empty cup on a cafe table. He casually swaps it with a fresh cup of coffee. Then he picks up a piece of bread straight off a waiter's tray. Now he has free coffee and free bread. On his way out, he even pockets the tip left on a table. Suddenly he sees a beautiful girl leaving the cafe. As usual, he decides to follow her. But he doesn't notice a still lit cigarette has fallen into his pants. Just as he's about to speak to her, he feels a burst of heat. His pants are burning. Luckily he spots a half finished beer bottle nearby and uses it to cool himself down.

To keep her actions hidden from the guards, she tears pages from books, soaks them and mixes in soil to match the exact shade of the wall. These makeshift papers become her false wall. The color is nearly indistinguishable. She paces them over the tunnel opening, buying herself more precious digging time. She never goes out for recreation, telling the guards she prefers to stay in her cell and read. Three months later, her secret tunnel has stretched more than 500 meters. On this day, a prosecutor arrives for an unexpected inspection. She knows this is her only chance to welcome the officials. The warden arranges a performance. She has been unseen for so long that even the other inmates barely remember her face. The guards have let down their guard as well. In broad daylight, she quietly slips back to her cell. The guard delivering food approaches as usual, assuming she's reading again. He knocks but gets no response. He quickly opens the door. Only to find the cell completely empty.

All of them were skilled in martial arts. The master poured the scalding water into their cups, but none could bear the heat. Yet this boy endured it because he was different from the rest, the master instructed only him to drink the boiling water. Without hesitation, he drank it down.

He had years of experience with the sharp sword, which hundreds had bowed down to. Even then, the boy was ready. He faced the master's attacks head on. Though young in age, his skills were sharper than many season warriors. In the end, the master broke the boy's sword, leaving him unarmed. Still, the boy didn't stop. He grabbed the master's sword with his bare hands, slid forward and landed a powerful punch that shook the master's Jaw. Then he leapt into the air, delivering another blow that hit the master's neck. He swiftly seized the sword, throwing it far away. The master barely survived, but the sword pierced into a pillar. After that, the boy showed no mercy. He punched straight into the master's chest. The master fell the victim of his own sword. He never imagined that one day he would.

Others concealed themselves and timber trucks, yet were discovered during inspections. None of these were the primary objective. They'd orchestrated a mass breakout for 250 prisoners. When operations commenced, a prisoner deliberately ruptured a water line. As guards rushed to fix the leak, two complicates retrieved steel rods from a vehicle's undercarriage, passing them to cell block operative. Simultaneously, both interior and exterior prisoners began rhythmic hammering. The camouflage tunnel excavation sounds.

Next, while checking the delivery truck's mechanical issues for the driver, he secretly measured the distance between two steel beams under the chassis. Then he made a wooden board of the same size, just large enough for him to lie on when the driver came back to deliver goods. That would be his best chance to escape after the cargo was unloaded. Using the truck's engine noise as cover, Jimmy quickly grabbed the board, rolled underneath the vehicle and secured himself between the two steel beams. Only by hiding on top of this board could he possibly pass the upcoming security checkpoint. Cause the engine noise was so loud, the driver didn't notice anything unusual throughout the entire process. At the prison gate, the guards used an inspection mirror to check the underside of the truck. Thanks to the board's concealment, Jimmy went undetected. But just 500 meters after leaving the prison, the truck suddenly stopped. Fortunately, it wasn't because Jimmy had been discovered. The driver just needed to relieve himself. But Jimmy didn't seize the chance to escape. Instead, he quietly crawled out from under the truck. And hid behind the tires. As the driver was about to return, Jimmy quickly ran forward, circled past the front of the truck and hid.

If I fail, I'll quit the team myself. Seeing the fierce determination in his eyes, the coach decided to give him a chance. The game kicked off immediately. Alex caught the ball and sprinted forward. His path clear as he locked onto it effortlessly with a perfect shot. The game kept going. Alex faked a pass, then locked onto his target again, passing the ball swiftly. It landed perfectly in his teammates hands. He signaled to the team and the game continued. He could even hear his teammates breathing. He locked onto the path and passed with pinpoint precision. The ball smoothly landing in his teammates hands again. It was a flawless touchdown. The crowd went wild. Jordan spoke up. Alex is definitely getting a starting spot. But the girl replied coldly, that wasn't his doing.

Determined to uncover the truth, vision pushes his way to the edge of town, slamming into a massive wall of glowing red energy. He forces himself through, but the instant he breaks the barrier, his body starts to tear apart piece by piece, as if being dragged back into nothingness. Outside, sword soldiers close in on him, and vision uses his last bit of strength to beg for help, but he collapses before he can finish his sentence. Inside West View, Wanda's son suddenly feels it. Dad's life is slipping away. He races home to tell her. And the moment Wanda hears it, her world shatters. She freezes the entire town in an instant. The wind stops, voices stop, even time itself halts. Then she unleashes everything. A tidal wave of scarlet magic bursts outward, expanding the hex like a living monster, swallowing the horizon. It stretches and twists, devouring everything in its path until vision is pulled back into the bubble and reassembled by Wanda's very reality.

So my husband threw them out. But what they said next changed everything. My parents always treated me like the family servant, while my brother got everything. Growing up, I'd mow lawns while he played video games. I do laundry while he hung out with friends. When I complained, my dad would say I was being ungrateful. I left at 19 and never looked back. I met my wife in grad school. She saw how my family treated me and was horrified. When I told my parents we were getting engaged at 25, they said she was beneath me, that I was making a mistake. We got married anyway. Just her family there. They moved to Florida about eight years ago. Honestly, our relationship only works with distance. We text sometimes, but it's always tense. Last month, my wife and I bought our dream condo. Two bedrooms, downtown, everything we wanted. We were thrilled, but kept it quiet from my parents. They're paying for a storage unit nearby, and I knew exactly what would happen if they found out. As far as they knew, we rented a studio near my wife's office. Yesterday afternoon, I was working from home when my college buddy Ryan knocked. Behind him were my parents, running like they pulled off a surprise. Ryan ran into them at target and thought it'd be nice to bring them over. The moment They walked in and saw our open concept living room, the granite counters, the balcony view. My mom's smile died. She looked around slowly, face getting redder. Then she exploded. She screamed about how selfish we were. All this space and we never offered to help with. She yelled about how we've been getting along so well lately. Why would I lie? She said I was sneaky and ungrateful, just like always. I stood there frozen. Ryan looked horrified. My mom kept going. Family helps family. You clearly don't care about us. That's when my wife came home. She walked in, saw my mom gesturing wildly, saw my face, and her expression hardened. She set down her bag. Stop yelling in our home! My dad quiet until then. Face bright red. Your home? He spat. You mean the home my money helped buy? The room went silent. I felt my stomach drop. I turned to face my parents. What money? My mom's angry expression shifted to something smug. She crossed her arms. We've been sending your brother $1,500 every month for eight years to help you both. We assumed he was splitting it like we asked. My wife's jaw dropped. I couldn't breathe. Eight years, $1,500 a month? That's $144,000. My brother bought a boat last year. He went to Japan twice. He drives a Tesla. And I'm standing in my first home that we scraped together for learning. He pocketed money meant for both of us. My hands shook. As I called my brother on speaker, he answered, hey, what's up? Did mom and dad give you money for me? Long silence and quietly. They said it was for both of us to use however we needed. So you used it all? Another pause. I figured you were doing fine without it. My mom's smug look was racking. She was realizing what she just exposed. My dad looked between me and my wife, face pale now. I hung up. The room was so quiet, I could hear my heartbeat. My wife walked to the door and opened it wide. Her voice was ice. Get out the condo we bought with our own money. Don't come back. My mom tried to sputter about family, about misunderstandings. My wife just stood there, holding the door. My dad grabbed Mom's arm and pulled her out. As they left, my mom turned back. You'll regret this. My wife closed the door in her face. We stood in silence, and she hugged me. Ryan was sitting on the couch, stunned. I'm so sorry. I had no idea neither.

Doctor Young realized he had made a terrible mistake and rushed to the observation room. The female doctor was still performing CPR.

But the moment he stepped onto level ground, he could move with surprising agility. The boss also had an unusually sharp sense of smell. So sharp that he could tell from hundreds of feet away exactly which employee had eaten garlic. He'd immediately order that person to go wash thoroughly from head to toe. All of these bizarre, almost inhuman behaviours didn't escape the attention of Jack. When Jack noticed that the second floor floorboards were made entirely of glass, a bold idea crossed his mind. If the glass under the boss's feet would to shatter, the boss would fall through, and Jack could finally confirm whether his boss was truly human or not. To test how much weight it would take to break the glass, Jack quickly built a small computer program. But while he was running his experiments, his boss suddenly appeared behind him. Thinking fast, Jack explained that he was just developing a gravity game. Surprisingly, the boss seemed intrigued and even told Jack To finish the game overnight.

That's how she got the supervisor's fingerprints. Her teammate then made an identical finger mold. Later, Lisa made her way to the bank president's office. Once the guard left, she pulled out a U V. Light from her bag and quickly scanned the painting on the wall. Lisa was pretending to be an art authenticator, but she was actually planning to rob the bank's vault. Nick recorded Lisa's every move on video, then slowed down the playback speed. He used this footage to replace the bank's surveillance feed. Lisa took the opportunity to locate the safe and attached an unlocking device to it. Meanwhile, the guard was staring at Lisa on the monitor, completely unaware that Lisa had already cracked the safe. After Lisa got the vault key, she immediately started laser scanning it. Nick received the data and used 3D printing tech to create an exact replica of the key. Once Lisa was finished, she put the key back in its original spot. But just then, the bank president walked in, completely messing up their plan. If the video loop ran out of time, the president appearing on the surveillance would definitely raise suspicions. So Lisa pulled out her phone and asked the president to take a work photo of her. But when he took the picture, he was still in the frame, so Lisa had to ask him to step back. A little more. The president backed up a few steps and walked out of the camera's view just as the video loop ended. This trick the security chief's eyes. At that point, Mike disguised himself as a janitor and entered the conference room. He used a scanner under the table to map out the vault structure below. But halfway through the scan, a group of people suddenly came in for a meeting. Mike got trapped under the table, and two documents fell from the table surface. Mike had no choice but to crank the scanners power to maximum. This triggered the alarm, and all the staff got up and left. Everyone gathered in the main hall. The military units across the street immediately mobilized and surrounded the entire bank. Lisa had just finished scanning the second key, but didn't have time to put it back in the safe, so she had no choice but to take it with her. Mike came to the stairwell for backup, and when no one was looking, Lisa quickly tossed the key to Mike. Mike immediately returned to the office and placed the key back in its spot. Just then, a security guard entered the room and Mike pretended to get startled. He explained he was wearing headphones and didn't hear the alarm. He successfully fooled the guard and escaped.

It wasn't until I held her and felt her warmth that I started to believe this was real. But what happened next proved this wasn't a dream. I found myself inexplicably wearing yesterday's suit. I quickly changed out of it. I remembered she burned her hand making coffee yesterday, so I rushed to the kitchen to stop her. This time she used a towel for Protection, but later she burned herself with a curling iron on the way to work, I recalled someone spilled a drink on her yesterday, so we took a different route, but another person ended up spilling their drink on her. I realized what happened yesterday might not have been a dream. These things were meant to happen just at different times in different ways. To test my theory, I told her that her watch would break on the way to work. But when we got to the office, the watch was perfectly fine. I felt relieved, thinking maybe she was right and this was all just a coincidence. After work, I took a cab to pick her up, only to discover the driver was the same one from the accident. The driver seemed to know something, but when I asked if there was a way to prevent the tragedy, he didn't give me an answer. He just said, I didn't Have much time left. I didn't understand what he meant. I found my girlfriend and decided to get her out of the city. I let her choose the destination, anywhere she wanted. On the train, I got lost in thought until I noticed the familiar scenery of my hometown. She had chosen to go to the place where I grew up showed just how much she loved me. On the way home, it started to rain. We took shelter from the rain in an abandoned cabin on the Hilltop. While lighting the fireplace, I accidentally bumped my arm. The watch ended up breaking. After all, I felt hopeless, unable to escape fate's plan. The next day, we went back because she had her graduation recital. She had been preparing for three years. This was her dream. The performance was a success. The audience gave her a standing ovation. Afterwards, we went to our favorite restaurant. I gave her a carefully chosen gift, a bracelet charm to commemorate our precious memories. As we left the restaurant, it started to rain and at the same time, that familiar taxi appeared. We got in the car together. Faith had no intention of letting us go. What was meant to happen happened this time. I shielded her with my body. If one of us had to die, I didn't want it to be her.

The teacher put tiny pieces of newspaper in our mouths. Because we'd never tasted candy before. The printing ink had a hint of sweetness. My family was so poor, we couldn't even afford decent shoes. Dad could only make me shoes from rubber off old tires. I hated those shoes, but I never dared complain. The next day, I wore those weird shoes to school. All my classmates laughed at me. I shielded my little brother from the crowd so he wouldn't get made fun of, too. Later during class, I threw my shoes in the trash. The teacher saw I was barefoot and got really angry. The teacher never allowed anyone without shoes in his classroom. So I was forced to put those old shoes back on. Students started laughing again. The teacher banged his stick on the desk. The whole class went silent. He said I shouldn't feel ashamed for not having shoes, because he himself once went without shoes too. He told everyone that people who mock others for being poor should be the ones feeling ashamed. After hearing that, I got my confidence back. But my bad luck kept going. Dad lost his job and we got even poorer. I could only eat spoiled food every day. Soon I got so weak I passed out. I was rushed to the hospital, but was quickly kicked out because we had no money for treatment. My brother's birth made things even worse at Home, mom went to the charity center for food every day and often had to borrow money from others. Seeing all this, I realized I had to make money. I went to a factory and started working in the coal mine. Because I worked so hard, the boss gave me a glass of lemonade and rewarded me with a dollar. I ran home and gave all the money to mom. She brought water and washed my cold covered face. From that day on, I worked every single day, giving all my earnings to mom. But one day, mom said, stop going to the factory. My eyes were badly damaged. I could barely see anymore. I was sent to the hospital again. Luckily, my eyesight was restored. But all our family savings were spent on my treatment.

The girl ran to the cabin, lifted a seat cushion and unexpectedly discovered a suspicious weapon. Without pausing to think, she turned, opened the opposite seat, retrieved a towel, closed the box and headed to the deck. Her mother had already been pulled aboard. She walked over, draped the towel around her mother, relieved to find her unharmed. She turned to return to the cabin to sleep but was jolted awake by a clamor. She rose to investigate. Pirates were boarding the ship. She retreated back into the cabin, quietly opened the door, unlock the box and retrieve the firearms. But when she peered out again, her mother's boyfriend had already fallen overboard and her mother was nowhere to be found. Terrified, she hid back in the cabin. The pirates opened the door and entered the cabin. She curled up in a corner. Fortunately, the pirates glanced around and left. She breathed a sigh of relief. But after they left, she peered out and saw flames through the door crack. Opening the door, she found the entire cabin engulfed in fire. She grabbed the fire extinguisher and fought the he's all night. Though the fire was extinguished, the ship was badly damaged. Huddled in the corner, she picked up a photo and discovered to her horror that her mother's new boyfriend was part of the pirate crew. That had boarded the ship the night before. She resolved to find and rescue her mother.

Spotting his girlfriend falling, the man hurriedly used his superpowers and zip downstairs at lightning speed. He first blew air outward to slow down his girlfriend's fall. Then he used his laser vision to open the parachute. Once he saw that his girlfriend was safe, he quickly rushed back upstairs so no one would know he was Superman. But his girlfriend was still suspicious, so when they went on a date, the woman jumped into the water to test him again. Oh, my god! The man didn't want his Superman identity revealed, but he saw his girlfriend about to be swept away by the river. He used his laser vision to break a branch, and the woman grabbed it just in time. The man then pulled her to safety. But back home, the woman's tests didn't stop. When the man wasn't paying attention, she actually pointed a gun at him. Without waiting for him to explain, she pulled the trigger. The woman was shocked that her boyfriend was completely unharmed.

Knowing human vision spans only 180 degrees, he believed staying out of sight would grant him complete invisibility. Yet, when the guard entered the cell, he spotted Tai Sook in the corner. At once, though this earned him a slap across the face, a triumphant smile spread across his face. This proved his theory correct. He then began practicing free climbing. The next day, when the guard returned for inspection, tehsook vanished from the cell again. Only after the guard turned away did he realize tehsook had scaled the wall. This moment enraged the guard, resulting in another brutal beating. Yet Taisuke refused to give up. Theoretically, achieving invisibility required perfecting his footwork to the extreme, allowing him to vanish from the guard's sight. So when the guard returned for the next inspection, Taisuke grew clever. He followed the guard's footsteps precisely. Unexpectedly, this tactic worked. The guard searched for minutes without finding Taisuke. But just as he believed his invisibility had succeeded, the sunlight cast a shadow that betrayed his position. The next second, something terrifying happened. Yet it was precisely the guard's words that instantly awakened Hesook. After the guard left the cell, he drew an eye on his hand, imagining someone always standing before him. He had come to understand that to achieve true invisibility, one must learn to anticipate the target's actions and thoughts. Finally, after repeated practice, his invisibility Technique reached the Pinnacle of mastery. His figure vanished completely from the cell. When the guard made his next rounds, Tesisuk knocked him to the ground in one swift move, then tossed him out. The guard dared not provoke Tesisuk again, and hastily slammed the cell door.

She never eats the food they bring her. Instead, she collects the food and smears it on the walls, uses the salt from the soup to corrode the walls, then digs with a homemade iron spoon. She's trapped in a prison surrounded by water on all sides. To avoid being discovered by the guards, she tears pages from books, soaks the paper in water, covers it with dirt, making the paper the same color as the walls. Paste these papers over the hole to buy more time for digging. She never goes outside for recreation and tells the guards she prefers reading in her cell. Three months later, she's dug a tunnel over 500 meters long. On this day, a prosecutor comes to inspect the prison. She knows this is her chance. The warden arranges a performance to welcome the officials. Since she hasn't come out in so long, her fellow inmates haven't seen her either. The guards don't pay attention to her movements. She walks back to her cell in broad daylight. The guard delivers her meal as usual, assuming she's reading in her cell. Guard knocks but gets no response. He quickly opens the door only to find the cell completely empty. He rushes to sound the alarm. The performance stops. To ensure the official safety, the warden personally escorts them out. After returning to the cell, the warden furiously scolds the guard in charge. He angrily grabs a book. And hurls it at the wall. The book hits the paper covering the tunnel entrance. The warden peels back the paper, discovers the tunnel. In that moment, he seems to understand. He immediately orders someone to crawl inside. After a difficult crawl, he finally reaches the end of the tunnel, but he discovers it's a dead end. So how exactly did that woman escape?

Strange sounds came out of her mouth, but she didn't dare make them too loud. Seeing this, the man clicked the mouse a few more times. As a result, the woman instantly felt short of breath. She couldn't take it anymore and quickly ran out. Turns out this was a magical mouse, could control the real world. At first, the man thought he was hallucinating, but after repeated tests, he realized it was real. So he had a crazy idea. He ran to the balcony and used the mouse to select a car downstairs. Then something ridiculous happened. The car could actually get bigger and smaller just by dragging the mouse. When the owner saw his car turn into a toy model, he was instantly confused. Then the man randomly selected a few people on the street and clicked delete. The people actually disappeared. That's when he realized he'd caused a huge problem. He wanted to escape with the computer, but suddenly a giant mouse cursor appeared in the sky and locked onto him. Before he could react, the cursor moved onto his body and the next second, the man instantly disappeared from the world.

The dog nearby was completely stunned by the scene. Just as I was lost in this sweet moment, my mom suddenly came home. I quickly pulled up my pants, rushed to the window and sat down, pretending to study. The moment the door opened, my mom immediately sensed something was off. She asked why the phone was on the floor. I quickly explained that the dog knocked it over. Then I took the dog out for some fresh air. Unexpectedly, during the walk, a handsome boy from my class showed up. I had been crushing on him for a long time. Even though it was just a casual stroll, I treated it like a date with him. When he said he had to leave, all the wonderful fantasies in my heart were shattered. As he was leaving, he mentioned he was throwing a birthday party next week and invited me to come hang out before the party. I carefully dressed up at the party. He was immediately drawn to me. Later, when we stepped outside, we shyly gazed at each other. We slowly moved closer to each other. I quickly told my best friend what happened. Just then, the boy came over and denied everything.

She finally understood she had truly gone back in time. At this point, her grandmother hadn't yet fallen ill. Seeing her grandmother so healthy, tears instantly streamed down her face. Suddenly, she remembered right now at this moment, her car accident hadn't happened yet. She held her own legs tightly, vowing never to use a wheelchair again the next day.

They will make fine slaves. With 50 men, we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want. You ever feel like that, Trent? You ever feel like making someone do what you want, whether they want to or not? It's a very European mentality stemming from the oppressive political and religious structures of the Renaissance. Kings and priests with absolute power, ruling masses who have none. That was the mentality of the men Who discovered America. And it's the mentality our society struggles with today. What you know of history is a dominant culture's justification for its actions. And I don't teach that. I'll teach you what happened to my people and to yours because we're all the descendants of the subjugated, every one of us. Excuse me, miss um long. Miss Long. I'm sorry. I wasn't. I didn't mean to.

She left subtle hints, hoping he would notice. Nearby, Carmen watched everything unfold. The fort and tourist areas were eerily empty. Doctor Nathan tried to tend to the wounded. Holden slipped away, staying out of the killer's sight. Jackie Griffin pressed on, refusing to back down. Up high, the next assassin ready to strike. Marty gripped his weapon, heart racing. Crimson flags hung tattered and stained. The mansion halls stretched endlessly, tense and dark. Carm knew the agreements had been broken. Sean whispered to the next guard. Another killer watched Jackie's every move. Reagan hid on the rooftop. Unseen. Shadows crept silently across the estate. Hilton Carrara and Sevia stayed hidden. Every door in the upper hall hid danger. Plans were rushed, precise and threatening. Jackie moved tense, focused, unstoppable. Chanel covered the right side, scanning the rooms. The surviving doctor guided the injured to safety. Clues scattered across the house hinted at danger. Every corner was a trap, every step a threat. Jackie's focus was sharp, nerves taut. Survival tools littered the rooms. She stepped carefully, avoiding all traps. Faint noises warned of threats nearby. She aimed to reach the car fast. The mansion's high ceilings echoed chaos below. Iron gates and locked doors slowed pursuit. Alpha and others waited, ready to ambush. The house felt alive, tense and ominous. Traps were set, yet some pads remained open. Outside, the air was thick with danger. Shawchank's Jimmy chuckled quietly. Unnoticed hounds growled, marking approaching threats. Positions shifted, the house a maze of fear. Jackie navigated halls alert and calculating. Every moment stretched tension, unbearable flickering lights cast eerie shadows. Every corner hid new threats waiting to strike.

Earlier, the military had received Intel saying the plane was hijacked, so they prepared a tight ambush in advance, ready to strike. Their goal was to eliminate the attackers and save every hostage inside. But they waited endlessly without any sign of movement. The cabin stayed eerily still until suddenly the door burst open and a small boy crawled out. He clutched a teddy bear, his gaze empty and lost. With the situation unclear, the soldiers didn't dare rush in. They only escorted the boy back first, hoping he could reveal something solid. However, no matter what the negotiators asked, the boy stayed mute, eyes blank, as if replaying the bizarre scenes from the plane. Then he snapped back to reality and finally shouted in fear, saying the aircraft was crawling with vampires. They had to destroy it before sundown. The military dismissed it as childish nonsense. They assumed the boy was terrified and confused. To calm him, the doctor gave him a sedative. Meanwhile, in the cockpit, a man kept pleading to be released, claiming zombies would flood the world after sunset. But the military didn't believe a word. They still saw him as a hijacker and demanded he confess. As darkness crept in, the man suddenly lunged and hit the floor, evading a sniper's bullet. Did we get him? All units, keep the mission moving. The special ops team finally stopped waiting and launched their assault using external Tools. They forced the cabin open, completely unaware a bloody slaughter awaited them inside.

His entire tongue must be removed and when it grows back, the torture continues until every sin is paid. But these punishments are just warm UPS in hell.

Picked it up. A photo of a beautiful woman. Thought someone dropped it, flipped it into my pocket. The very next second, a shell hit the exact spot where I'd been sitting. The blast knocked me out cold. When I woke up, they told me my whole unit was gone. The medic handed me the photo. Saw you pick it up. Looks like it saved you back. Says keep safe. My buddies joked I had a guardian angel, but I knew it wasn't mine. On the battlefield, blessings from loved ones mean everything. So I tried to find its real owner. But nobody knew her. Eight months passed. I still carried it. My buddies teased me, you want to meet that girl and thank her lucky charm kept you alive? Right as he finished, another shell came in. I survived again in those war torn days. Photo felt magical. Kept me alive till the war ended. I came home with a broken soul. PTSD tearing me apart. At my sister's house, my nephew tried waking me. I pinned him down and instinctively it destroyed me inside. I survived the war, but couldn't find a reason to live. So I set out to find the lucky lady in the photo. Me and my dog on the road. After many cities found the lighthouse from the picture. Days of asking around, finally a lead. Her name was Beth. She ran a pet farm outside town. I rushed over. She walked toward me like an angel. I froze. Tried to explain, but she thought I was there for a job. Handed me an application mid sentence. Told her I walked 15 kilometers. She thought I was crazy. Tried to have her grandma send me away. You wanna hire a crazy guy? Are you crazy? Sir, my granddaughter thinks you're unstable. I told them my old job was violence. Now I wanted peace. And I knew how to train dogs. Grandma hired me and found me a place nearby. I plan to work hard till the right moment. To tell her the truth, I worked my ass off. Finished a full day's work in no time. Fix the doghouse, beams, the forever broken tractor. Clean the whole yard. Grandma liked me. Beth didn't. She said I stared too much. Made her uncomfortable. She didn't know. Every time I looked at her, my war torn soul found peace. One day, a cop car rolled in. This cocky guy stepped out, stared at me, shocked. Without a word, he pinned me down, demanding my ID or he'd arrest me. Turns out he was Beth's ex husband. The town's infamous dirty cop. And what happened next changed both our lives forever.

The stolen cash totaled $300 million, weighing three tons. But they had to fly over the Andes Mountains, where altitudes reached 6,000 meters. No one was willing to abandon the mission, so they decided to take the risk and took off with the three tons of cash. For safety, they maintained an altitude of 500 meters. But as they approached the mountains, the plane started shaking. During the climb, the pressure on the aircraft grew heavier. But they had to cross the highest peaks to reach the other side of the ocean and complete their mission. As the plane hit its maximum altitude limit, the vibrations grew more violent, the engines making strange noises. To survive, they had no choice but to jettison. $100 million Out the window! With the weight reduced, the plane quickly gained altitude. They were about to clear the summit when suddenly the plane began a steep dive.

Every night I play games until the early morning, then sleep until noon the next day. I've been single all my life and still live with my parents. After eating, I go upstairs to my room and then stay there all day. I usually only go out late at night and only to the convenience store to buy instant noodles and drinks. I'm extremely socially anxious, afraid of talking to people. Even when I communicate with my parents, I do it through notes. One day when I got up for lunch, I saw a message from my mom on the lunch box. She said she wanted to remodel the house into a two family home. I kept wondering why. We were living just fine, so why change it? Suddenly, before I could figure it out, I heard a crowd of people outside the door. My social anxiety made me too scared to face them, so I grabbed my lunch box and hurried back to my room. It turned out my parents and my sister had arrived, along with a renovation company manager who brought the blueprints. My sister and her husband didn't want to rent anymore, so they planned to move back home with my parents during the remodel. While they were discussing the details, the manager suddenly said the house wouldn't be a standard two family design Since there was a single man in the family, it would be turned into a 2.5 unit home instead. Hearing that, my sister got upset. She complained that I was too old to still live at home, said I should move out and live independently. But my mom disagreed. She insisted that I stay there. It was a condition for the remodel. Seeing them about to argue, my brother in law stepped in and said he could give up his study room and that room could be used for me. So the renovation plan was decided. I had been eavesdropping on the whole thing, lying quietly on the floor listening. Then I suddenly heard the sound of children playing outside my door. My sister's two kids were running around upstairs. When I saw the doorknob turn, my nerves instantly tensed up. I hadn't seen my niece and nephew for years and I had no idea what to say to them. Finally, I gathered my courage and opened the door. But when I opened it, I saw Anna. It was my first time seeing her grown up. But she looked at me with disgust, calling me a creepy old man. I instantly felt a wave of regret. I should have just stayed hidden in my room. A few days later, the renovation began. The night before, I quietly moved out. At my usual convenience store, I bought a bunch of instant noodles, then dragged my luggage to an internet cafe. During My time as a shut in, I used to record my gaming videos and post them online because I was really good at gaming. I gained quite a few followers while chatting in game about my home situation. My gaming friends suggested I start streaming for money. They said with my skills, I could easily earn enough to move into a fancy apartment. I took their advice. The next day I started streaming without showing my face, but because it was my first time, I was too nervous and made a lot of mistakes. The viewers started insulting me in the chat, accusing me of being a fake skilled gamer. My first live stream ended in complete failure and my dream of moving into a luxury apartment came to an end.

This was one of the Shaolin Temple's methods for building arm strength. If my arms weakened even for a moment, then knives would cut into my body. On my first day of training, I had to carry two large buckets of water and walk up a slope. But after just a few steps, I couldn't continue and nearly tumbled down. Fortunately, I regained my balance just in time. I managed only one trip before my strength gave out. But to earn my place at the Shaolin Temple and learn Kung fu, I had to pass this test of strength. After just one month, I could easily handle the water buckets and even help newcomer monks. My master was very pleased with me, but used my unauthorized assistance to others as reason to send me to train under another master. I arrived at the wrist training area. There the master instructed me to use one hand to hold a bamboo pole and lift a 10 pound iron hammer. I was to strike the bronze bell in the courtyard following the rhythm of the master's wooden fish drum. At first, I couldn't even lift the hammer. I moved forward to grasp the bamboo pole. As the master tapped the wooden fish, I attempted to strike the bronze bell. But before long my striking slowed down considerably. I could barely hold the bamboo pole. My senior brother Wouldn't allow me to stop, and I had no choice but to switch hands and continue training. Through sheer determination, I quickly discovered the secret. By focusing my power at the wrist, I could easily lift the hammer with a bamboo pole. As the master's drumming became faster, I still managed to keep pace. The master then directed me to the next room. There, I had to stand between two large incense sticks, following the master's candle movement with my eyes only. At first, I kept up with the master's pace, but as his movements grew faster, I accidentally bumped my head against the incense. The master suggested I give up. But determined, I positioned myself between the sticks again, my eyes more focused than before. Suddenly, the master stopped and my head remained perfectly still. The master nodded with approval. Then came a greater challenge. The master instructed me to strike a wooden post illuminated by candlelight reflections. I responded instantly. The master recognized my exceptional talent for martial arts and accepted me as a student.

Still, I persisted and endured the pain. When I saw my fellow disciples practicing foot techniques, I picked up a bamboo stick and began to imitate them. But as I practiced, my bamboo was about to fall. Luckily, my arm had gained more strength. If that hadn't happened, master would have expelled me from the Shaolin temple. Because the bamboo structure was still incomplete, the master wouldn't allow me to go down to the courtyard. I had only one option left to keep building the bamboo structure and secretly learning Kung fu. One day, I saw the other disciples practicing on wooden training dummies, so I made my own dummy from bamboo sticks. But as I tried to spin the dummy, I fell down. At the last moment, I grabbed the dummy with both hands. Master saw this and threatened to throw me out immediately, but I argued that I haven't even touched the ground yet. The master angrily kicked the and it began spinning wildly. I saw my chance and climbed back onto the roof, and I finally built a bamboo structure around the entire temple. The master ordered to break it completely and get out of the temple. I thought he was joking, so I stood upright on the bamboo poles. The master tried to shake the bamboo with force, but I held onto the wall with both hands. When He applied force again. I easily maintain my balance on the poles and returned to the roof. Then I jumped straight into the courtyard, where I was never allowed to go. I went straight into the training area with heavy iron weights. But the master blocked my way. I pushed away his hand and began practicing. He attacked me several times, but I kept my balance, dodging each blow. The master was shocked. He launched another attack to see how much Kung fu I had Learned. I dodged each of his attacks with great skill. I even broke the training sticks. Then he struck with a powerful blow and I fell straight into the most dangerous part of agility training. But using the footwork I had Learned, I easily overcame all the obstacles. Till the master said, I cannot stay in the Shaolin Temple because my temperament is not right for this place. I didn't know that he had deliberately given me this task so that I could secretly learn martial arts. And now that I had completely mastered Kung fu, it was time for me to say goodbye to the temple.

He accidentally shattered the expensive crystal chandelier in her living room. He knew there was no way he could afford to pay for it, so he offered to stay and work for free to pay off the debt. Surprisingly, the wealthy woman had zero interest in him. Finally, the man played up the pitiful, helpless act, and the woman's heart softened. She agreed to his proposal.

To avoid any unnecessary misunderstandings, the woman told her male housekeeper to hide quickly. While she tried to stop her brother from coming inside, the CEO brother still discovered his presence.

The man didn't want to cause her any more trouble, so he decided to move out of the house. The next morning, he left a resignation letter and was gone. On the dining table was the last breakfast he'd made. In the days that followed, the woman often thought about him. Once, when a delivery person knocked on the door, she thought he had come back, only to realize she was just imagining things. The woman discovered she had truly fallen in love with him. She finally decided to call him and arrange a meeting. She needed to tell him how she really felt.

To protect him, the father installed a protective net around the house, and the family moved to an isolated Orchard. But as the child grew, stopping him from flying away became harder. Every time the mother lost sight of him, she panicked. That's when the father, like a true superhero, would fly into the sky, find a child, and bring him home safe and sound. The couple hoped their son would learn to control his power. So. So the mother tied a rope to him, trying to teach him to fly steadily. But the boy was too young and couldn't master the skill.

She immediately roused her husband. Using her heightened senses, she detected hundreds of armed enemies closing in on the house. The father instantly understood they had been found. Knowing there was no time to fight, he told his wife to take the child and escape through the basement. Then he walked out alone to face the entire enemy squad. He intended to surrender, but the enemy knew his power and was prepared. Suddenly, the father grabbed one enemy trying to fly away and escape with him. But this enemy also had superpowers. The others quickly surrounded him, using specialized restraints to bind Him until his strength was completely drained. In Madeira, the father used telepathy to contact his wife, urging her to flee quickly. Only then did he slowly descend to the ground.

But when he pulled her out, he discovered it was just a doll. He couldn't help but laugh and cry at the same time. He and his companion continued on their way to work at the mall. Along the way, he casually dried the doll off. During this, he picked up a necklace. The doll instantly transformed into a real person. As soon as he set it down, she reverted to being a doll. Arriving at his workshop, he gazed at the doll's beautiful appearance and silently wished she were real. After glancing around to make sure no one was nearby, he couldn't resist leaning in for a kiss. He then began his work, tidying up the goods and casually removing the doll's necklace. Jesse, who had slept for 1,000 years, awoke. She she sneezed. Jason, startled, fell backward onto the floor. However, Jesse was delighted to see Jason, for he bore an uncanny resemblance to her fiance, the prince from 1,000 years ago. Just then, several workers from the truck arrived. Jesse immediately froze, pretending to be a doll. After confirming the doll was undamaged, they turned and left. Jesse's stomach suddenly growled. Jason drove her out to get something to eat. She gazed at the world a thousand years later, fascinated by everything. She even ate the food wrapper. Jason taught her how to eat modern food and took her To a dance hall to teach her how to dance. Finally, he brought her back to his home, and they spent a wonderful night together.

Startled, she jumps up and urges the boy to leave immediately. Right then, her friend texts her, saying she's already at the door. Panicking, the woman shakes the boy awake and rushes to open the door. Once inside, the friend casually announces she'll be staying for a few days and starts heading upstairs. Luckily, the boy has already escaped, but in his rush, he left a single sock behind. Unfortunately, the friend discovers it. Seeing this, Anna quickly claims it belongs to her son. The friend buys the story without hesitation. Anna is actually the CEO of a company. Years ago, her husband was tragically killed when a hitman mistook him for someone else during a morning jog.

After they leave, Jack whispers sweet words to Anna, and just like that, they cross a line they shouldn't have.

The reason was clear. Mr Han wasn't some creep. He was actually searching for a hidden camera. After checking carefully, he discovered that the camera had been placed there by the art teacher. Mr Han went to confront him, but just then, loud screams came from inside. Mr Han was never the type to care about consequence. In the past, he had broken three ribs of his own boss during an argument. That fight cost him his job as a boxing coach. And later, he became the school's PE teacher. On his very first day, he clashed with some students. Two girls kept staring at him, whispering that his strong build made him look more like a gangster than a teacher. They rejected Mr Han's apology and instead admired the charming art teacher. On paper, Han was a PE teacher, but secretly he was hired to collect debts. Still, he never raised his hand against young students. He decided to start with the smallest debt, which belonged to a girl named Elena. Soon after, he saw Elena climbing over the school wall to escape. He followed her and was shocked when she entered a nightclub. Inside, someone tried to harass her. Han pushed the guy aside and grabbed Elena's hand to pull her out. A dangerous thug appeared, but even he went silent. After seeing Han's intimidating presence outside the club, Han finally Learned the truth. Elena was looking for her missing best friend. After her parents passed away, the friend was forced to work in that same club, and then she disappeared. That night, Han dropped Elena home, promised to help find her friend, and warned her never to go to such places again. Just as they were near the house, a car slowly passed by. The strange shadow of its headlights looked suspicious. Elena ignored it. But when the car stopped, she felt something was wrong. Meanwhile, Han noticed Elena's phone had fallen in the car. He turned back to return it. But at the bridge, he saw a man in black clothes carrying Elena away. The kidnapper escaped, but Han rushed Elena straight to the hospital. Later, he grew angry at the careless police investigation. As he thought deeply, one detail clicked. Smell of cigarettes had been coming from the school restroom. Furious, he stormed inside and caught three delinquent girls. They denied smoking, but Han checked every stall. That's when the shocking truth appeared. Again, a hidden camera was installed.

Just then, a group of other zombies approached, drawn by the smell of a human. The zombie smeared a liquid from his hand onto Julie's face. He leaned in to sniff her. The human scent was gone. Safe, the zombie pulled Julie to her feet and took her back to his shelter. Julie cried, curling up in a corner. The zombie smoothed his hair. Instantly looking a little more handsome, he tried to approach, but only frightened her. Julie raised her dagger, ready to strike back at any moment, but the zombie simply covered her with a blanket and turned on a record player to calm her nerves. The zombie stared at Julie.

This time, Julie brought the zombie home. She bathed him, put makeup on him and applied lipstick, making him look like a real human. But his true identity was discovered. Julie quickly ran with him to escape, but they found themselves on a dead end. Keep you safe. The zombie held Julie tight and jumped off the ledge, using his body as a shield to protect her. He took the full force of the impact on his head. Julie surfaced only to find the zombie sinking beneath the water. She quickly grabbed him and pulled him up, managing to revive him. Julie was deeply moved by his sacrifice and love. They shared a kiss. The zombie's eyes began to regain their color.

Common sense says that when there's a fire, The stairwell is your best escape route. But that wasn't the case here. The stairwell wall suddenly collapsed, and countless people fell with them. Since the stairs were gone, the elevator became the only option. But people ignored the weight limit and kept cramming in. A woman had just reached the door when an old man shoved her aside. Just as the old man was halfway through stepping in, disaster struck. The terrified woman realized she had to take matters into her own hands. She rushed back into the hall, looking for a way out. But as everyone surged to one side, the floor started tilting. Ceiling cracked open. Sure enough, the floor gave way, too. Luckily, the woman caught on in time. With quick reflexes, she climbed onto a stable platform. But another person wasn't so lucky. They fell straight onto the glass. Though the glass hadn't shattered yet. It only takes one last straw to break. When would the piano dangling overhead come crashing down? It turned out that lodged in the swaying chandelier above was that coin that had been blown away in the explosion. That's right. This coin of death was the key to everything. When it stopped spinning, the ending was already written. And that boy who'd escaped down the stairs, his final moment had arrived, too. The ballroom finally couldn't take it anymore and began collapsing entirely. The woman survived. For now. The boy hiding in the cabinet had made it, too. But the Crisis wasn't over. The woman had just pulled the boy out when the walls around them started crumbling. Nowhere left to go. She could only leap down. Then the entire hall came crashing down. By sheer luck, her wedding ring caught between two steel beams. But hanging thousands of feet in the air. How long could she hold on? In desperation, her fingers began to break, which meant death was coming for her.

Atrapó las llaves de la mesa sin esfuerzo. Justo al abrir la puerta para escapar, las esposas se cerraron en sus muñecas. El tacto frío del metal la congeló al instante. La mirada vacía del guardia la hizo darse cuenta al instante de que algo andaba mal. Su respiración era estable y lenta. Obviamente sonámbulo la confundió con su novia. La jaló para bailar. No tuvo más remedio que seguir sus pasos, moviéndose lentamente en la habitación estrecha, girando al ritmo, agarró las llaves sin problemas.

La había encarcelado por su excesiva posesividad. En ese momento, derribó accidentalmente un estante de hierro. El director ubicó su posición al instante, la encontró y la acorraló contra la pared. Ordenó al guardia que la devolviera a la celda. Pero el guardia ya había visto su verdadero rostro. Se dio la vuelta y lo esposó exponiendo fríamente su crimen de encarcelamiento ilegal.

At the first turn, there's a wooden stick, then a second one and a third. Clearly, this isn't his first escape.

I always assumed she was just shy. But one day I accidentally heard her thoughts. She was struggling, wondering if she should tell me that her sister always hit her. I froze on the spot. I never imagined that every time I went on a business trip, my adopted daughter had been bullying my real daughter. Just as I was about to confront her, my daughter's voice appeared again. In her mind, she said in her past life, she died while I was away on a trip. Before I could process anything, my husband urged me to hurry, saying we'd missed the flight. I slapped him without a word. No matter what, I was staying with my daughter. Today, six years ago, during childbirth, my biological daughter and the adopted one were accidentally switched. I only brought my real daughter home half a year ago. Since she returned, my husband treated her gently. But why? Did she deep down that he didn't like her? Was his affection all an act? I still prepared to take her to school, but when I packed her bag, the adopted daughter stormed in and shoved her to the floor. I rushed downstairs, furious. But before I could speak, the adopted girl acted like the victim, crying that my daughter hit her. My real daughter kept apologizing, even though she did nothing wrong. I comforted her and said it wasn't her fault. I Thought the adopted girl was just jealous. I was wrong. At her door, I overheard her cursing me, saying she'd teach my daughter a lesson the moment I left. The child I spoiled for years was hiding this kind of cruelty. My daughter ran over timidly and asked if she could skip school. She didn't want me angry, so she only said it in her heart. Her sister was furious today and would definitely punish her at school. That pushed me over the edge. I called the nanny and kicked open the adopted girl's door. She trembled. She'd never seen me like that. I ordered the man me to take her back to the orphanage, but instead the nanny scolded me, calling me cruel, saying the adopted child was smart and promising while my daughter was timid and useless. I slapped her immediately. Either she took that girl away or they both left. She sneered, saying my husband hired her and I had no right to fire her. No wonder she was so arrogant. My weak husband had been backing her up. I called the bodyguards and threw her out of the villa. From today on, no one would ever bully my daughter again. At school, the principal said my daughter wasn't on the enrollment list. I was shocked. I told my husband to enroll both girls and he gifted them 20% of the company share. Smart said he knew about the stairs, but the boss said they were all For the adopted girl, he told me to stop dreaming that I was just a housewife and shouldn't ask for anything for an illegitimate child. I slapped him. The story was, but before he could speak, I slapped him, too. He claimed he was afraid our daughter wouldn't fit in, I don't know, at school. I told him to place. My daughter is the only heir. She doesn't need to adapt to anything. If the school wasn't worthy of her, I would shut it down. The principal mocked me again, calling me a mistress. My husband panicked and kicked him to the ground. Their reactions made me suspicious. I had never visited the school, so why was the principal so sure? My husband hurried to explain that he gave shares to the adopted girl out of pity because no one else loved her. But at that moment, my daughter's inner voice laughed softly, not love, but she still have her pretty animal.

I stood in the crowd filled with sorrow and rage. My mom was killed by him. This scumbag felt no regret. That smug grin on his face. I couldn't hold back my anger anymore. I rushed straight ahead, determined to kill him myself. Cops tried to stop me, but they were no match for me. Just as I near the killer, a stun gun hit me. I collapsed helplessly to the ground. The murderer walked over with a mocking smile. John watched from the crowd. He froze right there. He saw his own old pain, the pain of losing a loved one. Only those who've been through it get it. South Korea has no death penalty. Even the worst criminals go free by exploiting legal loopholes. No matter how heartbroken the family, they can only suffer in silence. So John spent 20 years building a revenge base. It's made to punish those who escaped the law. He named the team revenge taxi. Members, hacker expert, visa mechanics Mark and chip, and mastermind John. They just needed one thing, top tier driver. He saw my skills that day. John got interested right away. He checked my records that night. Turns out I'm an ex special forces soldier, exactly who they needed. He came right to me, handed me a taxi driver's ID, invited me to join Revenge Taxi to bring justice to lawbreakers. I was burning with anger. Couldn't avenge my mom. So I said yes at once. My first target, rapist. He deserved life in prison, a fake mental illness to get free. People protested with signs. Nothing changed. They threw garbage at him. That set off his true evil side. He acted humble in public but showed his true colors in the car. But he'd never be arrogant again cause he was in my custom taxi. At the intersection, I drifted perfectly into a side road. Jim had stopped the reporters pretending his car broke down. The criminal smiled, thinking he escaped. Then he said something wrong. I was driving the wrong way, he yelled, demanding where we're going. I didn't answer. He pulled off his belt to strangle me. I knocked him out with one punch. Scared to get close, he kicked the seat like crazy. I took out a tranquilizer dart, stuck it right into his body. Then I drove into a tunnel. Another taxi appeared ahead. I hit the booster, sped past it, drifted sharply to line up with. I handed the ankle monitor and his luggage to John, then drove to the tunnel service area. Mark moved fast, tore off the taxi decals, took down the taxi line. I flipped the inside switch. The logos flipped over. And second the taxi turned into a private car. We drove right past like nothing happened. That monster criminal disappeared from the public eye forever.

I froze for a moment, praying I could throw it back before it blew. But the next day I woke up completely unharmed. I put on the same blue shirt as yesterday and walked outside only to get shot dead. But the following day, I came back to life again. This time I spotted a beautiful woman on the street and I instantly fell in love. Just as I was about to walk toward her, a train blasted past. But it didn't matter. I die and respawn the next day anyway because I'm just an NPC in a game programmed to repeat the same routine, wake up with a blue shirt, drink coffee and head to the bank for work. In this game world, people wearing sunglasses are real players and those without them, like me, are NPCs. As usual, I waited for the players to rob the bank. A few thugs open fire. I got used to it, calmly collapsing to the floor and chatting with the security guard. Suddenly, I spotted the girl from yesterday and desperately wanted to chase her. I tried to borrow a player's sunglasses but got punched. Eventually, I managed to grab a pair. From that moment, everything changed. The sunglasses show floating icons. A med kit appeared on the ground. Touch it and all wounds healed instantly. When players fell, money popped out and collecting a boost to my bank balance. So I went to the Store and finally bought the shoes I always wanted. But soon my odd behavior caught the programmer's attention. They suspected a hacker had broken in and entered the game to eliminate me. Seeing myself hunted, I ran for my life. In desperation, I noticed buttons on my shoes and hit the switch, launching myself straight to the eighth floor. But the programmers quickly closed it. With nowhere left to run, I jumped again. The game code even appeared in the sky. As the system struggled to contain, they chased relentlessly and with no path ahead, I leaped from the heights. I tried grabbing a rope, but slipped. At the very last moment, I tapped the shield icon for my sunglasses and in the end, I safely escaped their pursuit.

He carefully applies the hair growth lotion to his scalp. But suddenly the lotion sticks to skin. He feels a sharp sting. Even though it hurts like hell, he grinds his teeth and keeps going. He keeps rubbing the lotion on his scalp. He has no idea what this will cause. Just an hour ago, he bought a bottle online. The seller promised it was magic and effective. He reads the instructions. Step 1, shave your head. Step 2, apply the solution. Step 3, put on the silicone cap and wait a few minutes. When you're done, you'll have thick hair. He stares at himself in the mirror, hesitating. Finally, he cuts his hair with Scissors. Then he shaves it clean with a razor. Then he pops the cap ready to go. Just as he's about to apply it, he sees the liquid squirming. He freezes, staring at the sincere smile on the man on the label. He hesitates again, but decides to continue. He spreads the lotion on his scalp. A searing pain shoots across his head, but he doesn't stop. He keeps squeezing the bottle hard. The liquid suddenly jets out, splashes into his eyes. He staggers back several steps and crashes to the floor. He immediately rinses his eyes with water. Then something strange happens.

As they continued evading the killers, hunting them down, it turned out she was actually his client, someone he'd been hired to protect. Along with the large sum of cash she was carrying, Jack made a bold decision. He climbed up a nearby tree and threaded a rope through a hollow in the trunk. Once the rope emerged from the other side, the woman tied the case to it and then Jack gave it a hard pull, successfully hiding the case inside the tree. With everything secured, they could come back for it later. With the job done, both of them finally breathed a sigh of relief. Once they were ready, they set off again, walking for what felt like hours until they finally crossed the mountains and reached the valley below. Just then, Jack noticed a car approaching from behind. To his surprise, the driver was an old friend he hadn't seen in years, so their tension immediately melted away. But just as they were about to get in the car, Jack suddenly blacked out. When he regained consciousness, he found himself tied up. His old friend now stood over him holding torture tools, demanding to know where the money was hidden.

She picked it up and was about to walk away. The shop owner noticed and stopped her. But she suddenly turned around and let out a furious roar. That's when everyone realized she was a vampire, so they immediately tried to take her down. In this era where humans and vampires coexist, vampires have it really tough. They usually hide everywhere, never daring to show up in the human world. Elisa ran for her life and finally crawled back home through the window. That's when she realized how serious things had gotten. She kept apologizing to her dad, but outside, a huge crowd had already gathered. They were all wearing red masks belonging to an organization under Van Helsing that specializes in hunting vampires. Alyssa wasn't too smart, either. She basically LED the hunter straight to their home. At that point, there was no turning back. Whole family had no choice but to run. John went up to a coffin, but no matter how much he knocked, there was no response from inside. So he had to force it open. Inside Lay Alyssa's grandmother, an ancient vampire elder. Before John could even explain the situation, she already smelled silver and garlic coming from outside. That stuff is deadly to vampires. There was only one way to survive, to get out of there fast. By then, Van Helsing himself had arrived downstairs. For centuries, they'd been hunting vampires everywhere. Grandma had finally found a Safe place to hide in this town. But thanks to Elise's careless mistake, the whole family's location was exposed. To keep them safe, grandma activated the Ruby on her chest, sending out a distress signal to other vampire clans. Then she set the curtains on fire to cause chaos and let her family to flee. But as soon as they got downstairs, Lisa suddenly froze. A blue light started glowing in her palm. Then images began flashing through her mind. Her thoughts were drawn to a forest. There was a coffin. The next second, an old man appeared inside. It turns out she had accidentally awakened the vampire ancestor Dracula. But she had no idea what was really happening. After getting separated from her family, she had no choice but to go back upstairs and hide. Since she knew the layout of the house really well, she managed to avoid the woman searching for her. But just when she thought she was safe, ran right into a man. She ran as fast as she could up to the attic, but the man still caught up to her. In a panic, she lied and said she was human, not one of the vampires they were after. The guy almost believed her, but the mirror next to them gave her away because vampires don't have reflections. Once she was exposed, she bolted. She quickly escaped through the roof. She kept running for her life and finally reunited with her dad. But before She could even catch her breath. The blue light appeared in her palm again. It wasn't the first time it happened. Every time it did, she saw strange visions. Old vampire being awakened wearing a Ruby ring that symbolized power. And he could somehow sense the girl's presence. It was like the two of them were connected. John was shocked when he saw that not every vampire had that kind of ability. And vampires don't dream at all. So what exactly is Elisa's true identity? Follow me to find out what happens next.

She turned around to look again, still in disbelief. Then the old man walked up to her, asking her for a favor. He glanced at his wife, who was crying her heart out. He had died so suddenly, he never got to say goodbye. He wanted the girl to tell his wife that even though he was gone, he still loved her deeply. To make sure she'd believe it, he shared secrets only they knew. When the girl passed on his words, the old woman broke down in tears. Once the old man's last wish was fulfilled, his spirit finally moved on. Years later, the girl, now grown, married a man who loved her deeply. But on their wedding day, she noticed a strange compass symbol appear on the window. Her husband asked if she was seeing ghosts again. Melinda lied, saying she was just spacing out. But as she stepped away, a soldier in old military uniform appeared outside the window. Later that night, Melinda woke up to a loud thunderclap and noticed her husband was missing. She got up to search for him, and when she reached the bottom of the stairs, she saw the ghost of that same soldier. The soldier told her he wanted to go home to see his pregnant wife and needed her help. She wrote down All the information and started searching for his wife the very next day.

He and his girlfriend struggled for a while managing their studies and raising a child. Thankfully, our parents were supportive and helped him. I also helped in any way I could. Eventually, he finished his studies, landed a job at 27 and married his girlfriend. Then their second child, James, was born. Both of them spoiled him a lot. Whenever our parents or I said anything, they claimed James was their planned child and since they were in a good position, James deserved it. The same time they neglected Jack. They gave James expensive gifts, toys, clothes, snacks and everything. The saddest part is that Jack never once complained. I watched that kid be happy just because his brother was happy opening his gifts. James, on the other hand, was spoiled rotten. He constantly compares his things to Jack's. And if Jack ever gets something good from someone, he wants it, too. This problem kept growing. The negligence towards Jack worsened and James started taking advantage of it.

I was not going to enable this kid like his parents did. Few days after Christmas, Jack came knocking on my door. The kid was crying and shaking. I let him in, calmed him down and asked him what happened. To keep it short. After I gave them both a Nintendo Switch, Jack was too happy with it. He played The Legend of Zelda whenever he had time and had so much fun. That didn't sit well with James, ruined Jack's fun. James broke his console and cried to their mom, claiming that Jack had broken it. Their mom believed him, snatched Jack's console, gave it to James and grounded Jack. Jack just lost it. This time, years of unfair treatment finally got to him, grabbed James by the neck and started choking him. He said he didn't know what came over him, but his mom screaming and beating couldn't stop him. He just saw red. He started yelling at James, demanding him to tell the truth. James Was struggling and begging Jack to release him. And finally, James admitted the truth. Jack let go. James was left gasping for air and Jack ran away straight to my apartment. After a while, my brother called to ask me to send Jack home because he had a lot to answer for. Jack wanted to return home to face the consequences alone, but I went with him.

Years later, his worst fear came true. My father has always favored my sister. Not only does the family call him out on it, he admits to it. His defense is that my sister looks so much like our late mother that he can't help but spoil her. My sister caught onto this and used it to her advantage. If she wanted something from the store, she had to say please, dad, and he would get it for her. If I asked for something, my dad would ask me what I had done to deserve it. And if I couldn't think of something good I hadn't recently, I didn't get it. Never. My sister did something bad, she would begin to cry and dad would easily forgive her. If I did something bad, I always had to face the full consequences. Dad would leave work and get my sister from school for anything as small as a splinter. While I could be throwing up, dad would say he couldn't leave work and I had to tough it out. I tried hard to earn his love and attention, but nothing worked. I tried excelling at school, acting out and even forcing myself to get into his hobbies in hopes we would bond that way. The day I gave up was the day I found out how little my dad cared about me. I was Turning 15, the plan was for me, my dad, sister, uncle and two friends to go to an arcade two hours away. The day before my birthday, my sister got the sniffles. My dad could not travel and we would have to cancel the trip. I tried to convince him to leave her with our grandparents, but he didn't want to leave her to suffer alone. He told me to call my friends and tell them while he went and called my uncle. After he walked away, I went and cried my eyes out. About a gallon of tears later, I got a call from my uncle telling me not to worry. He would take us to the arcade. I had a great time and forgot all about my dad and sister. When I got back and my sister saw all my prizes, she asked if she could have one. I said, sorry, no, these are from my birthday trip. Later, my dad came to me and told me it would be nice if I gave my sister something, replied with something along the lines of, you know what would be nice if you didn't try to cancel my birthday over my sister's runny nose. My dad called me selfish and said my sister's health was more important and I would be a good big brother if I gave her something. I didn't give her anything. After that incident, I gave up on my father. I focused on those who Cared for me. My father either didn't notice or didn't care. As long as he had my sister, that's all he needed. He didn't start caring until it made him look bad in the public eye. During my senior year, the band had an award ceremony. I didn't even bother asking my dad to attend. Instead, I asked my aunt and uncle. My dad didn't notice until he saw the family post on Facebook in the school. Any of the comments on the post asked why my dad wasn't there.

If she wanted something from the store, she had to say please, dad, and he would get it for her. If I asked for something, my dad would ask me what I had done to deserve it.

If I did something bad, I always had to face the full consequences. Dad would leave work and get my sister from school for anything as small as a splinter.

I tried excelling at school, acting out and even forcing myself to get into his hobbies in hopes we would bond that way. The day I gave up was the day I found out how little my dad cared about me. I was Turning 15, the plan was for me, my dad, sister, uncle and two friends to go to an arcade two hours away. The day before my birthday, my sister got the sniffles. My dad could not travel and we would have to cancel the trip. I tried to convince him to leave her with our grandparents, but he didn't want to leave her to suffer alone. He told me to call my friends and tell them while he went and called my uncle. After he walked away, I went and cried my eyes out. About a gallon of tears later, I got a call from my uncle telling me not to worry. He would take us to the arcade. I had a great time and forgot all about my dad and sister. When I got back and my sister saw all my prizes, she asked if she could have one. I said, sorry, no, these are from my birthday trip. Later, my dad came to me and told me it would be nice if I gave my sister something, replied with something along the lines of, you know what would be nice if you didn't try to cancel my birthday over my sister's runny nose.

My mom called once and said, your father is hurt, that you won't come around anymore. Family is supposed to forgive. I said, family is supposed to show up, and hung up. Six months after my swearing in ceremony, I got a call from my dad at 2 in the morning. He said, Silas has been arrested. You need to come to the police station right now. I was exhausted from a long day in court, but I got dressed and drove 40 minutes to the state. Silas had gotten into a bar fight and assaulted someone badly enough to send them to the hospital. The charges were aggravated assault, and he was looking at serious prison time. My dad grabbed my arm when I walked in and said, you have to fix this. You're a lawyer. You can make this go away. I said, I'm a criminal defense attorney. I don't make things go away. I defend people in court. He said, so defend him. He's your brother. I looked at Silas sitting in the holding cell, and he wouldn't even look at me. My dad said, we're family. You owe us this. I said, I owe you this. Where were you six months ago when I got sworn in? My dad said, this is different. This is important. That was just a ceremony. I felt something cold settle in my chest and said, you want me to represent Silas? He said, of course. You're his brother. I said, my hourly rate is $500 dollars. A case like this will probably cost around 50,000 by the time we get to trial. My dad's face went red and he said, you're going to charge your own brother? I said, you're asking me to use the law degree you said wasn't a big deal? The one you couldn't be bothered to celebrate? Yeah, I'm going to charge him. My dad said, how can you be so selfish? He's family. I said, family shows up. You didn't show up for me. Why should I show up for him? Alice finally spoke up and said, come on, you know I didn't mean anything by missing your thing. This is my life we're talking about. I said, it was my life too. I worked for years to get that degree. I sacrificed everything. And when I finally succeeded, you chose a golf tournament over being there. My dad said, we'll pay whatever you want, just please help him. I said, I'll represent him. Standard rates, 50% up front. And I want you all to know that every single hour I Bill is an hour you told me wasn't worth your time. I got Silas a plea deal that kept him out of prison. They paid every invoice on time. We haven't spoken since.

It turned out he was a thief who had come to steal a famous painting. But just as he was about to leave, he typed in the wrong password. That mistake triggered the security system and the entire house went into lockdown. He also lost contact with his accomplices.

Tres criminales gritaron mi venganza por Harvey y asesinaron a un agente de patrulla. Cuando el equipo táctico llegó a la escena, la oficial Cris, reconoció a la gente fallecido. Había sido su compañero en el pasado y siempre tuvo mala reputación en el departamento. Miembros de la mafia habían amenazado con matarlo anteriormente. El equipo táctico se dirigió al centro de operaciones de la pandilla y arrestó al líder mafioso. Sin embargo, tras el interrogatorio, el líder negó rotundamente haber asesinado al policía. Mientras el líder permanecía bajo custodia, ocurrió otro asesinato de un oficial en el exterior. El autor, también gritando venganza por Harry, mató a otro agente, pero durante su huida, uno de los criminales resultó herido por la policía.

There are countless things in this world much more valuable than these pieces of paper. I hate being in debt. So just. Just name your price. You will give me the first thing that you see at your home. But after hearing what he said, I scoffed without hesitation, because his condition was way too easy. So I quickly brought him back to my house. I thought he just wanted to pick out a few valuable things. But right then, my daughter suddenly called out to me. I opened my eyes instinctively and looked over. Yes, I will take her! No, no, no, no, no! Not. Not her! We got a deal? Yes, but she's not A thing? She's a human being. She. She's my daughter. So it turns out there is something more valuable. Money. Hearing our conversation, my daughter was furious. She yelled at me for making stupid bets again. Clearly, this wasn't the first time she was completely disappointed in me. The next second, the man said he was taking my daughter. There was no way it allow that. But when I threatened him, he stayed perfectly calm. Then he said he'd be back in a month to take her. And in an instant, the man seemed like a completely different person. That's when I realized I had provoked someone terrifying. Over the next month, I pushed all my work aside to stay with my daughter. To keep him from coming back. I even hired a whole team of security guards. I thought my plan was flawless. But the next second, the man appeared on the couch.

To make sure they lost, the coach replaced the skilled goalkeeper with a clumsy new player. At first, the plan worked. The opponents quickly scored one goal. The coach smiled, but he didn't know that the new new goalkeeper was secretly a Golden Ball specialist. From then on, no matter how hard the opponents tried, they couldn't score again. He blocked every shot like lightning. Fans went crazy, but the coach's heart broke. Now it was the final chance, a free kick. The coach sent a boy onto the field who had slightly crossed eyes and always messed up passes. Just then, Holland's Son came running back from the bathroom.

Ah fuck! Holy shit! Oh fuck me! He got so scared that he held his urine back instantly. But the wealthy woman didn't react at all when she saw the burglar, leaving the thief totally at a loss. So he just came clean about planning to rob the house. Yet she still didn't care after hearing that. She just casually reminded him to close the door on his way out. Feeling something was wrong, the thief looked around and spotted an empty medicine bottle on the table. That's when he realized she was trying to take her own life. But when the thief approached her, tentatively picked up the bottle and checked the label, he burst out laughing right then, because it was just a bottle of vitamins. Yeah, that's fucking good.

Seeing she knew nothing about the medicine, the kind hearted thief offered to help her choose the right medicine.

No one dares to slack off even a little because the arc is the only hope for humans to survive. Turns out scientists detected this disaster three years ago, so they secretly started the project early in Tibet, China. And each arc can carry over 100,000 people. Except for world leaders and top scientists, everyone else must pay €1 billion for a ticket. At that moment, a mega tsunami hit the US west coast. Even Ford class carriers were tossed around. But the wave didn't slow down at all. It swallowed land with total destruction. But the US wasn't the only victim. Other nations face disasters never seen before. An 8 magnitude quake was just an aftershock in this chaos. Even Mount Everest was drowned by the tsunami. Then billionaires worldwide got an encrypted text urging them to board the Ark quickly. That's when Luke realized the disaster was here. As a regular guy, he couldn't afford a ticket. So he rented a plane with a watch worth 100 grand, planning to escape with his family. On the way, Luke called his ex wife to bring the kids. He said he would be there in five minutes and warned that California was about to sink. But his ex thought he was crazy and hung up without hesitation. But then the house started shaking hard. She realized he was telling the truth. She quickly pulled the kids under the table. Right Then Luke arrived. He had no time to explain. He just yelled for them to get in the car. Then Luke slammed the gas and sped away. The ground behind them collapsed wildly. Houses on both sides fell apart. Two old people blocked the road ahead, so Luke swerved onto the sidewalk. But the overpass was collapsing. Luke had no choice but to floor it through. But when Luke finally made it to the airport, he found the pilot he hired was dead. So Gordon, who only took a few lessons, was forced to take the cockpit. The quake raced toward the airport at high speed. The runway was getting swallowed, but Gordon hadn't done pre flight checks. So Luke shoved the throttle all the way forward. The plane took off right before the runway collapsed. They watched the city sink into the ground. Their hearts stayed heavy and shaken. Then Luke pulled out a map he got days ago. It showed the arc was in Chewing Valley, Tibet, but their plane couldn't make it that far. So they landed at Las Vegas airport planning to get a bigger plane. But the place was already in chaos. Everyone was trapped there. Then Luke saw his boss was there too. His assistants found a dual control jet. Gordon and the assistant flew it together and they got out safely. But the flight to China was way too far. They needed to refuel in Hawaii to make it. But they didn't expect this. Hawaii had turned into a sea of fire. They had no choice but to keep flying. Luckily, strong plate shifts a few days earlier made them reach Tibet earlier. But sadly, both plane engines failed. One after another, they had to crash land on the glacier. Panic. The boss had an idea. There were cars inside the cabin. They could drive out while it slid, using the runway to escape. But the assistant pilot didn't make it. He went down with the plane off the cliff. Just then, several planes carrying rare animals flew past. They thought they were saved, but Luke and his group were denied without tickets. Only the boss had a ticket, but he ditched his girlfriend, only planned to take his two kids. But Luke didn't give up. He LED his group forward. They found a car just in time ahead. The driver heard Luke's call and kindly took them away. Meanwhile, the White House team reached the Ark. They stared at the massive wonder before them. The VP couldn't stop praising it. Then Sader called in. Doctor Anne asked quickly which cabin he was in, but he was still in India. The plane meant to pick him up never showed up at all. But it was too late to say anything. A massive tsunami was rolling in. Goodbye, my friend. The would be savior was abandoned by mankind. He and his family vanished forever in the waves.

However, one day, while Jake was chopping wood shirtless, his strong and powerful muscle lines immediately caught the attention of Jenny, the mistress of the manor. She had never seen such a strong man before. Ever since catching sight of Jake's appearance, Jenny couldn't stop daydreaming about his looks every day. So she started sneaking over to Jake's residence to chat with him every day when her husband was out. During their talks, she even used all kinds of provocative remarks to tease him.

Because ever since she first got in touch with Jake, all of this had been permitted by her husband. It turned out that Jenny's husband had been injured while serving in the military a few years earlier, and when he came back, he was completely paralyzed from the waist down. Jenny had tried many methods to help her husband regain his masculinity, but all attempts ended in failure.

He understood what Jenny was thinking, and he also badly wanted to have a child of his own. So in the end, the husband decided to put aside his pride. He agreed that Jenny could go out to find another man, but on the condition that she must get pregnant. At first, Jenny thought her husband's act was an insult to her, until she met Jake, which completely changed her mind.

I kicked the door open and rushed into the street. A group of people were aiming guns at me, but I could feel incredible power surging through my new legs. In the blink of an eye, I'd sprinted several hundred meters. Even bullets couldn't keep up with my speed. My name is Nick and just few days ago, I was a student at MIT. As a straight a student, I was a master hacker who knew everything from astronomy to geography. But I suffered from a leg condition that forced me to walk with crutches. That day, my girlfriend, Haley, my best friend Jonah, and I were on a road trip to help Haley move. That evening, I received a message from a mysterious hacker. We'd been going head to head in a tech battle for a while, but this time he had directly hacked into Haley's computer and was monitoring her every move. Not to be outdone, I quickly traced the hacker's location. Jonah suggested we track down this hacker and settle things once and for all. But I was in a terrible mood at the time. Haley and I were having relationship problems. I felt like she was looking for an excuse to leave me because of my leg injury and that this move was just a cover for breaking up with me. The more I thought about it, the angrier I became and I decided to go after that hacker. Along the way, he sent us photos from traffic cameras showing our vehicle clearly taunting us. We use the GPS coordinates to find a small cabin. Jonah and I went inside to search the place, recording everything as we went. Suddenly, Haley, who had stayed outside let out a scream. When I rushed out, I saw her actually flying away. Then a flash of white light hit me and I instantly lost consciousness. I don't know how much time passed, but when I came to, I found myself sitting in a wheelchair, completely unable to move. Cross from me sat a man in a hazmat suit named Wallace who said he would help me recover my memory. Wallace told me that, uh, we had come into contact with extraterrestrial life forms and had likely been contaminated. As he spoke, my nose began bleeding black blood. After examining me, Wallace had his subordinates take me back to the isolation room. The next day, I was brought back to that same room again.

Los padres querían que él se quedara, pero el director insistió en echarlo al final, no tuvo más opción que irse a Nueva York a buscar trabajo. Pero la realidad le pegó fuerte. Las escuelas de la gran ciudad no querían contratar a un maestro que venía del campo para mantenerse cerca de lo que amaba. Se puso a trabajar medio tiempo mientras buscaba una vacante.

What? You did what? You what? I need time to reflect on my future. Whether or not to stay here another year at BMS or go pro. Dude, that's an easy decision, man. Go pro. Make that dough now. Where are the girls? Agreed. Go. Why don't you go pro? I don't know what to do. Just get out of here. Why would you cancel the private party? Digiquest, you need to go on an Apache vision quest. It's a journey into the inner mind, spiritual awakening. So I figured out which school to go to, went into the woods, and five days later, a little spider with the face of Jeff Goldblum said, go to BMS. It's a sacred tradition. Hell, even Jesus went on a vision quest. 40 days in the desert. I don't have 40 days. Of course you don't. That's what drugs are for. Somebody get my suitcase. All right, No. 1, mushrooms. Those will open the door part way. No. 2, Black Matilda, otherwise known as peyote. Little bit of that, and that door will swing wide open for you. And then. Ay, ay, oska. Special blend of shrubs from the Venezuelan jungle. This shit won't just open the door. It'll blow the goddamn hinges off. I also had some DMT in here, but I may have done that on the weekend. Now we can just mix up some turpentine or. What did you just do? What That was enough drugs to last all of us the rest of the week. I got a lot to think about. Okay, we have to leave. I want to see what happened. No, you don't. We gotta lock all the doors and the windows and back up everything that could be traced back to us. Really? Now? Come on. I think I can handle a few plants. I'm okay. I'm okay.

Now know more about the final hours of Anna Kepner's life. And it all comes from surveillance footage. Now this surveillance video is not actually out, but the recorded events have been reported. As we know, Anna left a family dinner early citing that she wasn't feeling good. On this surveillance footage you do see Anna walking into her cabin. Now remember, Anna was on this cruise with her family, which was her father, her stepmother, her 14 year old biological brother and her 16 year old stepbrother. The three of them shared a cabin. Both of the boys had bunks and I had her own bed. On this surveillance video you see Anna come into her cabin. And then a little bit later you see both of the boys come. Not too long after the 14 year old is seen leaving the cabin in a different change of clothes and he's going to take snapshots of the cruise ship. This leaves Anna and the 16 year old stepbrother in the cabin alone, likely some of her last hours. Now the younger brother did come back to the cabin and he did not see Anna, but he thought that she was just out with the adults having a good time and thought nothing of it and went to bed. Nothing was thought to be wrong until the next morning when everybody reconvened for breakfast. But only the boys showed up. No Anna. After reporting her missing and Beginning a search, a medical emergency was announced on the intercom, which reportedly drove Anna's father to rush to her cabin. And when he did, this is allegedly when he saw the maid discover Anna's body wrapped in the sheet under the bed, which would mean if the step brother did indeed do this, and remember, he is named a suspect right now, then that means he took her life, which we don't know the cause of death yet, placed her under the bed and then slept in that room like nothing happened.

Her sudden praise made guilt wash over him. From then on, he cared for her with genuine sincerity. Seeing her sadness over losing her hair, he used beauty filters. To cheer her up.

I couldn't stand her. We ended up in the same class, and everyone assumed we were a couple. I kept trying to avoid her. Five years passed like that. Out of spite, I started dating her rival, hoping she'd finally leave me alone. I made sure she saw us together. But my friend told her the truth, that I was only using the other girl. We broke up, and she went right back to clinging to me. Her behavior made me uncomfortable. One day, my kite got stuck in a tall tree. She climbed up, grabbed it for me, and asked me to join her to see the view. I refused, but she fell in love with that spot. She sat up there every day, just watching the scenery. When the tree's owner decided to cut it down, she begged me to help her save it. I ignored her and got on the school bus. Her dad eventually came to talk her down. She stayed quiet for a few days. Then she started chasing after me again. I refused to eat the eggs she gave me, saying her yard was too dirty. My dad told me to return them politely, but to avoid seeing her, I secretly threw them away instead. She still brought new eggs every day, until she finally caught me dumping them. I complained her chicken coop was filthy and full of germs. For the first time, she got angry. She Stopped following me. He started spending time with my quiet grandfather. He even helped her clean up her yard. I felt ashamed and tried to talk to her. But now she was the one avoiding me. I apologized, but she wouldn't respond. My father mocked her messy yard, but my grandfather said it wasn't her fault. Her family spent everything caring for her sick father and her older brother with special needs. I went to where the tree used to stand. My grandfather said the view from the top must have been beautiful. I realized I'd refused to see it every time. Then I saw a news article about her protesting to save the tree. Suddenly I thought she looked kind of cute. I found myself secretly watching her.

It's just a sheer sense of, like, helplessness when you feel like you're locked on this aircraft. When she realized she was trapped on board, she texted a friend, I just woke up alone in plane. OMG. The friend replied, what? Nobody woke you up? Can you get off? Tiffany texted back, no, the door shut. OMG I'm stuck by myself alone on plane and then my phone died. Her friend says she called the airport, I said her plane would have landed two hours ago. She texted me that she just woke up. I said I. I don't know what's going on, but she's at the airport. Tiffany says there was no power on the empty plane so she couldn't charge her phone. She fumbled around in the pitch dark and made her way to the front of the aircraft and actually entered the cockpit.

Cada cliente que lo veía movía la cabeza y se marchaba. Incluso cuando su precio se redujo al mínimo, nadie estaba dispuesto a mirarlo siquiera. El gato comenzó a creer que nadie en el mundo lo querría. Dejó de comer su comida para gatos, miraba con desesperación a otros gatos ser adoptados y mimados. Un día, un hombre entró en la tienda de mascotas. El empleado le presentó ansiosamente a este gato porque pronto cumpliría un año y ahora nadie quería comprar un gato adulto. Si para ese momento sigue sin que nadie lo compre, lo tendrían que enviar a un refugio oscuro y pequeño. Pero su entusiasmo era tan abrumador que accidentalmente asustaron al hombre. El gato pensara, claro que nadie me quiere. Mientras el empleado se preocupaba por el futuro del gato, encontraron un collar en la entrada de la tienda, dos anillos colgando de él. Poco después el hombre regresó para buscar el collar. Resultó que el hombre extrañaba mucho a su esposa, por eso había colgado los anillos de boda en un collar para llevarlos y había venido a la tienda de mascotas porque de repente recordó que cuando su esposa estaba viva quería tener un gato. Mientras tanto, el gato pensaba que si fuera ese collar, quizás también podría ser apreciado por alguien. Mientras el hombre se disponía a ponerse el collar, un cachorro ladró de repente, asustándolo tanto que dejó caer el anillo y el anillo rodó directamente Hacia el gato. Cuando el hombre se agachó para recogerlo, él y el gato levantaron la cabeza al mismo tiempo. Sus miradas se cruzaron. El hombre miró fijamente al gato y el gato le devolvió la mirada. Así, sin más, el hombre decidió adoptar al gato. Tanto el empleado como el gato estaban sorprendidos. El gato no podía creer que alguien lo quisiera, pero el hombre pensaba que ese gato tan feo era absolutamente adorable y el gato disfrutaba del calor en sus brazos. No podía creer que esto estuviera pasando de verdad. Al ver que el gato había encontrado un dueño, el personal se alegró de verdad por él. El hombre se llevó al gato a casa, pero este tenía demasiado miedo para salir de su transportín, por si a la familia del hombre tampoco le gustaría. Entonces el hombre le dijo, al gato vivo solo aquí. Entonces el gato entendió que este hombre estaba tan solo como él, así que salió lentamente de la caja. Se acercó al hombre para consolarlo. El hombre empezó a decirle un montón de nombres al gato, lo que lo confundió por completo hasta que entendió que el hombre le estaba eligiendo un nombre. Finalmente, el hombre decidió llamar al gato Shang Chain, porque conocer a este gato le había devuelto la calidez a su vida. Pero era la primera vez que él tenía un gato y no tenía ni idea de cuánta arena debía usar, así que por seguridad echó una Bolsa entera también midió cuidadosamente la comida del gato.

La caballería rodeaba todo el sitio. Había francotiradores en los techos, incluso aviones y tanques patrullaban la zona. La seguridad era extrema, pero el presidente aún no había llegado.

Se apresuró a cerrar la ventana del dormitorio, luego se dirigió en silencio al salón con la intención de cerrar también la puerta de la casa.

Pensó que estaba a salvo cuando cerró la puerta, pero de repente todos los aparatos se encendieron y apagaron y emitieron un sonido desgarrador. Se apresuró a desenchufar la fuente de alimentación y finalmente todo volvió a la calma. Annie cogió el teléfono para llamar a la policía, pero el sonido penetrante comenzó de nuevo y la nevera se puso espeluznante. Peor aún, el monstruo había bloqueado las escaleras. Ella se retiró a la cocina y se escondió en un rincón. El teléfono también estaba colgado por el monstruo. La respiración acelerada seguía dejándola al descubierto. El refrigerador fue controlado de nuevo, atrapándola directamente dentro. El monstruo se acercaba. Paso A paso, Annie finalmente vio su verdadero rostro. Era en realidad un alienígena con grandes ojos. Annie gritó y empujó al monstruo. Entonces, Annie corrió hacia la puerta, pero el monstruo tomó el control de la puerta de la habitación. La chica fue noqueada. Al instante, Annie se despertó y se retorció apresuradamente dentro, pero su cuerpo estaba fuera de control.

Luego quiso llamar a la policía, pero el teléfono de su casa ya no funcionaba y todos los aparatos eléctricos habían perdido sus funciones. Aparentemente, el alienígena podía controlar objetos cargados eléctricamente. Annie decidió salir a buscar ayuda, pero extrañamente no había nadie en la carretera. Una ambulancia volcó en la carretera. Las casas cercanas también fueron atacadas. Ella no fue la única que se encontró con alienígenas anoche. Justo en ese momento, enormes nubes oscuras comenzaron a envolver el pueblo y siguieron acercándose a la ubicación de Annie. Ella tuvo que correr en dirección a su casa. En el camino, vio a sus vecinos que habían desaparecido. Extrañamente, estaban reunidos con sus manos derechas levantadas y con la mirada perdida en las nubes oscuras. Parecía muy espeluznante y algo parecía retorcerse en Sus gargantas y entonces un hombre vio a Annie. Ella no se atrevió a quedarse un momento y salió corriendo.

Even after leaving, her heart was still racing. The man's handsome face and confident posture had completely caught her off guard. But when she turned and saw the cleaning tools in her hands, she forced herself to calm down. Anyone staying in a hotel like this had to be wealthy or influential. And she was just a single mom earning a modest wage, someone who didn't even dare to dream about love, let alone mingling with powerful people. What Lisa never expected was that this powerful man would seek her out the very next day. Because she had no one to watch her son during his weekend break, Lisa had to bring him to the hotel and leave him with a coworker. As John rode the elevator alone to the restroom, he came across a familiar face. I know who you are. Yeah. What do you know? I know that you're the state senator. I know that you're thinking of running for senator. I know your voting record and your consistent stand on environmental causes. The man was the same guest Lisa had run into while cleaning the day before. Jack wasn't just a strong candidate for the Senate. He was wealthy, always surrounded by bodyguards and luxury.

Still oblivious, the man kept driving. While talking on the phone, he grabbed a lighter, but it was broken. He casually tossed it out the window. Unexpectedly, the gasoline caught fire. The unlucky killer drove straight into the flames. Almost roasted alive, he jumped out as the Jeep crashed off a cliff. Meanwhile, the man kept driving the leaking car. Angry at the repeated failures, the boss sent his top assassin at a gas station. The assassin followed closely, a sharp dagger popping from his arm. He flexed, showing scars from past victories. Confident, this mission was nothing, but the man remained oblivious. A gas station worker saw a small hole in The car and plugged it with chewing gum. The man stood nearby, using an air gun to blow dust off his head. Unknowingly, the assassin had released a special drug. As he approached, the air gun blew it directly into his mouth. Once again, the man escaped. Hours later, the assassin awoke, only to trigger his own dagger mechanism. The top assassin was dead. The boss realized the man was extraordinarily difficult to eliminate and sent five more agents. They finally caught him and even station guards around him. Unexpectedly, the man burst with strength, breaking free from his ropes. Instantly, he jumped out the window. Heavy guards waited outside, but when he raised his hands and surrender, it somehow worked and he escaped again. That night, killers tried to attack the man's son. The boy saw a beautiful arrow and decided to pull it out, unintentionally bringing down an entire power pole.

Once Mike was sure no one in the cell block was watching, he quickly thawed the frozen meat with water, pulled out the hidden saw blade and began preparing for his escape. Next, he tore toilet paper into long strips, broke apart an entire box of matches, wrapped them tightly in the paper and stuffed the bundle into an instant noodle bag. And Mike showed up in the common area and signaled to his partner on another floor as they passed each other on the stairs. The handoff went smoothly. While everyone was gathered downstairs for activities, the accomplice quietly started a fire in the cell next to Mike's shortly after he left. The flames spread fast. The alarm blared and guards rushed in to put out the fire. But the room was already blackened with smoke and would need a fresh coat of paint. This was exactly the key step Mike had planned. He then handed the sawblade fragments to John, who got to work making their escape tools with practiced hands.

And, but the thing is, is like even the nurses who were there, um, which by the way are still mostly male. I believe. But even the ones are female, they get evacuated first. Women are always evacuated first. In other words, the potentialities always there for these men. It's not really there for these women.

Look at me. Who ordered this? Nobody. That's the fucking problem. Just out here pouring and shit, watching Little Black slowly die. Mike felt really frustrated. If he let Kingston's prison system keep falling apart like this, he might as well quit his job as the underground mayor. Mike 1st thought of bones, the Crips gang leader. But when he found him, the guy was acting all paranoid, hiding at home, too scared to show his face. He said he didn't know what was happening outside either, but he was sure it was because there was no one in charge inside the prison. They had to wait for the gangs to elect new leaders to take control. But this couldn't wait any longer. Who knew how many more people would die if this continued? He had to make sure the prison elected someone in charge right away. Mike shared his plan with Prosecutor Evelyn. After getting her approval, the next day, Mike arrived at the prison entrance with the warden. The SWAT team leader and Deputy Warden Carney were already waiting there. Soon, the leaders of Kingston's four major gangs also all showed up, one after another. After exchanging greetings, prosecutor Evelyn arrived with a large team of cops and surrounded the place. Then Mike announced his decision in front of everyone. He was going to send all four gang leaders from the outside inside the prison to get their members in line. Until new leaders were chosen inside, the leaders felt this was acceptable. The plan worked for everyone's interest, so they all cooperated and surrendered peacefully. However, this seemingly reasonable plan had one huge flaw. For bones, this trip was destined to be extremely dangerous.

This time the criminal I'm hunting goes by the code name Wolf King. 20 years ago, he adopted several children from an orphanage. Later, he trained all of them to become elite thieves. Each one has their own specialty. Some are world class hackers. Some can change their appearance in the blink of an eye. Some can even perfectly disguise themselves as a woman when they're actually a man. Wolf King calls the shots from behind the scenes. A few days ago, they stole $2 billion in cryptocurrency and got away clean. But the police don't even know what Wolf King looks like. That night, I.

The buyer assembled the weapon almost five seconds faster than I could. Impressive, even for a trained operative. What puzzled me even more was that despite my intentionally misadjusting the scope, she still hit the bull's eye with flawless accuracy. All of it reminded me of the retirement request I had submitted to the organization not long ago, and how suddenly this assignment had appeared. You're certain that wasn't a coincidence? While I was still thinking this through, the buyer handed the weapon back to me, insisting that I fire around beside her to test the suppressor. In that moment, I had countless chances to take her out cleanly, but a better plan was already forming in my mind. She praised the weapon endlessly. Just as we were about to finalize the deal, I suddenly claimed that several components still needed refinement. She didn't question me, only granted me a three day Grace period. After leaving the meeting point, I kicked my car's front bumper hard enough to damage it, then drove straight to a repair shop. While the owner was busy with other vehicle, I quietly gathered several usable scraps for the next phase of my plan. Back home, I immediately began reworking the materials, reshaping, machining, and assembling them piece by piece, constructing a near perfect replica of the equipment involved in the deal. To match it, I bought a second hand firearm from the black market and completely rebuilt it. Making it look entirely ordinary while concealing extensive internal modifications. Then came the most crucial step. I prepared a set of altered ammunition, harmless in appearance, but fatally effective even without striking vital areas. Three days later, the transaction took place as scheduled. Just as I handed the modified rounds to the buyer, she suddenly demanded another inspection. I noticed the restaurant staff hastily retreating into the kitchen. Within seconds, the the entire hall was empty, as if I had walked straight into a trap. When the buyer returned, I discreetly concealed the backup weapon in my pocket. Fortunately, the inspection went smoothly, and the deal concluded without incident. Holding that thick stack of cash, I began to wonder if I had simply been overthinking everything. What I didn't know was that on her way back, the buyer received a mysterious call. What happened? There wasn't an opportunity. Find one. I'm already following him. Late that night, I briefly considered confessing everything to her. But what happened next shattered that thought completely. From the moment the deal ended, someone had been following me. At a quiet street corner, I slipped into the shadows, drew my pistol, and circled behind the tail. Just as I was about to pull the trigger, a motorcycle roared past, disrupting everything. My pursuer escaped by sheer luck. That incident confirmed my worst fear. The organization intended to erase me for good. The next morning, as I packed our bags, ready to take my wife far, Away from all this, I didn't realize a sniper's crosshairs had already settled on my head.

The guy was about to take a leak, touched down there and realized nothing was there. And he instantly freaked out. He slipped, hit his head on a water pipe, and died on the spot. Turns out this guy had taken part in a gang rape not long ago, and the girl's family did this to him. Next was the second attacker's cousin. Lived alone and was a total gym freak, drinking protein shakes every day. To bulk up, mom bought a whole box of apples, took only the seeds, ground them into powder. She snuck into his place and dumped the powder into his protein tub. When he got home, he mixed his usual shake and drank it. Right after he finished, he started foaming at the mouth. Mom was a biology teacher and knew apple seeds contain cyanide compounds. Tiny bit won't do anything, but too much is basically deadly poison. Even though he was rushed to the hospital, the doctor said there was no saving him. Then it was the third attacker, the one who first came up with the whole plan. The girl's mother broke into his house and scattered a bunch of apple seeds everywhere. She turned on his computer and changed the system time to the night before. Then search the internet for how apple seeds can turn into poison. She was setting him up. When she left, she triggered the fire alarm in The house. So when firefighters came, they naturally found the crime scene. The evidence was all there, and the guy was sent to prison for attempted murder. Later, the mother went to the hospital and told the paralyzed attacker everything, just to piss him off. As expected, he completely lost it, wanting to slap the woman right in front of him. But he couldn't move at all anymore.

But the man shot her a vicious glare and grabbed her by the throat. Downstairs, the neighbors heard the sounds of beating again. Judging by their faces, they'd gotten used to it. The next morning, the husband acted like nothing had happened. He even took out his phone and told his wife to smile for a loving couple photo. She forced a happy smile. Later, she went to visit her mother. One look and her mother immediately saw the bruises. But Mia insisted she was fine. Her mother angrily cursed her son in law. Back then, just to help her daughter get married, she had even used her big house as a wedding gift for the couple, only to end up watching her daughter get beaten every day. The mother begged Mia to divorce him, but Mia wouldn't listen. After that, they went to the market to buy lamb. While her mother was busy, Mia slipped off to the pharmacy. Without her saying a word, the clerk automatically handed her medicine for bruises. They were that familiar with her. Mia also bought alcohol blocking pills and she imagined what life might be like if her husband finally quit drinking. She crushed the pills and mixed them into the curry lamb she cooked. Meanwhile, her civil servant husband was being Humiliated at work, constantly ordered by his boss to scrub toilets.

Told me she was fine. Yeah, mom, she's 11. I'm no expert, but that sounds like a real parenting failure. I'm the first one in my class to get my period. It's embarrassing and gross. I had to wear sweatpants from the lost and found. There was an open mint in the pocket. You think that's bad? One time in gym class, I got my period. Ruined my shorts. Coach Vernon made me wear the lower half of the mascot's uniform. That's terrible. It was awful. Can I come in? Mom, can you tell her the story of what happened to you? One time I got my period on Rob Mcguire's white couch, and I ruined it, and people called me spot for, like, a year. I think I liked it better when I didn't know as much. It's not all bad. What are you doing? This is normal night laundry. Go back to bed. You okay? Why would I tell you when there's absolutely no way of you understanding? Get Out of my way

He was also caught on recording saying that Campbell's products are for poor people and that he won't eat them because he knows that they are unhealthy with the bio engineered meat in them. This was all caught on audio recording by an employee named Robert Garza of Michigan. Garza filed a lawsuit against Campbell's on Thursday and released audio he says features Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer Martin Bally. A Campbell Soup Company spokesperson released a statement that said we are proud of the food we make, the people who make it in the high quality ingredients we use. The comments on the recording are not only inaccurate, they are patently absurd. Keep in mind the alleged comments are made by an I T. Person who has nothing to do with how we make our food. If the recordings are legitimate, the comments are unacceptable and they do not reflect our values and the culture of our company. Mister Bally is temporarily on leave while we conduct our investigation.

What would you tell to the university students who is trying to advocate for that, um, in their university to make a change? Yeah, I mean, boy, it's a tough question. I would, I would try to graduate as quickly as possible, get the degree, stand for your own beliefs and your own conviction. These institutions, if they keep on doing d I and CRT, their money is going to dry up. President Trump is gonna defund schools like this if they keep on doing affirmative action. Yeah, he signed the executive order not gonna put up with it. And there's a lot of federal money that, that comes into these institutions. So try to graduate as quickly as possible. Thank you so much. Under Trump's administration, uh, how is energy production gonna benefit us the most? Well, we're gonna drill, baby, drill. Um, and we are going to fix the strategic problem patrolling reserve. One part of this that we're gonna, we're gonna lower gas prices. But think about what's actually raising gas prices. In addition, it's actually not as bad as it was cause Biden has opened up the strategic patrolling reserve to, to lower gas prices for the election. Um, and the Russian Ukrainian war, that war is artificially boosting gas prices. And also make sure we don't go to war against Iran, which would be a profound mistake for Our country. So that that's a really, really important thing. Drill, baby, drill domestically, peace in the Middle East, peace with Russia, Ukraine. You'll see gas prices go down to 30 bucks a barrel. Charlie, what does that mean? Dollar seventy five a gallon. That's what it means. Okay. Because, wait, can you be racist against white people? No, bro. I'm a cracker, bro. What the fuck? No, you can't be racist towards my bro. There's so many crackers here, bro. Haha. What is racism? Oh, it's discrimination based on the color of the skin. Based on the color of the skin. Got it. Thank you. So isn't it racist then to then penalize white people to come into college or to get jobs based on the color of their skin? Wouldn't that be racist? Your world view is indistinguishable from the KKK that you want that you want to organize the world based on skin color. We want to organize the world based on merit and character. I think that all communities will do even better when we stop living under the soft bigotry of low expectations. Inherent in your argument is that we have to pander to certain communities based on the color of their skin because they can't do as well as white people. I want to thank you for something. Oh, yeah. You, you are a perfect reminder why we won a November. So thank you for that. I really appreciate it. Thank you.
