Yet reaching the spot for harvest, they found all ice already grabbed. Thus, they headed back bare. Meanwhile, broadcasts detailed warming racks. Even tortoises began trekking. Bender caught it all and sank in sorrow. He journeyed far to aid a tortoise. Folks baffled why Bender rescued this tortoise. Bender clarified. Seeing the tortoise stuck upside, he recalled himself. Since when Bender flops, he can't write himself too. Hearing this all urged Bender to flop shortly to tackle warming, officials rallied top brains worldwide, staged a huge forum seeking fix for warming mess. One pro proposed huge space reflector, bouncing sun rays to cut solar heat hitting earth. Sounded solid. Yet when junk hit the reflector, it spun, pointing straight at earth. Sun rays bundled by reflector began blasting earth like beam gun. Crowds bolted every way, running for dear life. Then the prof admitted warming was his blame. He'd built bots in youth. Their exhaust rules awful. Other bot traits flawless. Bosses thrilled with outcome kicked off mass output. Bot fumes sparked the warming.

In a flash, Stan grew new legs, but the legs were very tiny. That day, Roger pushed Stan into the pool. A polar bear grabbed Stan and held him under. Luckily, the staff tranquilized the bear just in time. But the bear had already bitten off Stan's legs. I'll take you to the hospital. No, I need to save him. Roger secretly carried Stan away. By now, Stan was unconscious. Roger had to use a stick to move Stan's hands. Stan's CIA status got them into Area 51. The medicine to save Stan was here. Roger reached a room and found a box. After looking around, he finally found the lost fanny pack. He removed the bandages and put the ointment on his hand. Then he applied it to Stan's wound. I think it'll be fine. Don't worry. They'll grow back to full size. But if it'll take a few hours. So you'll need to deal with the tiny legs for a bit. Just as they were about to leave, people in Area 51 noticed them. Roger lied, saying he'd accidentally gotten lost. No, you're an alien. That's your picture. Stan's tiny legs made him move slowly and he wasn't used to them yet. Just as they thought it was safe, a grenade was thrown in front of Roger. Thankfully, Stan reacted fast enough. He pulled Roger out and they managed to escape. Stan's had his share of bad luck, like this. Time, for example, someone punched him in the jaw and it shattered completely. Now Stan can only drink liquids through a straw. This left him feeling completely hopeless. One day, he walked into a sandwich shop, ank the sandwich poster right off the wall. Stan demanded that sandwich. In under 3 minutes, it was ready. Stan opened his mouth with all his strength, only for his entire facial brace to come loose.

She tried begging him to let her go, pleading that she was pregnant. But he didn't care. He beat her savagely, throwing punch after punch into her stomach. By the time the cops arrived, my wife was already dead. The guy raised his hands with a smirk still plastered on his face. I rushed into the house and saw my wife lying in a pool of blood. The pain was unbearable. I pulled out my gun, ready to blow this killer away. But my partner stopped me. The guy had already confessed. If I pulled the trigger now, it would be murder. I forced myself to hold back, teeth clenched. The killer's name was Victor. Six months earlier, I busted him for drug smuggling. First day out of prison, he came straight for me. I stared at this monster, completely helpless. As a cop, I had to let the law deal with him. After my wife died, revenge consumed every thought. So I shaved my head, loaded my gun, and prepared to execute a crazy plan. Using his file, I tracked down one of Victor's hideouts. Before making my move, I tipped off the police about the location and went in armed. Three punks inside had no idea what was coming. The next second, I burst through the door and Open Fire. 2 dropped instantly. The third tried to fight back, but I didn't give him a chance. When my partner Billy showed up, I was already on my knees with my hands behind my head. I went to prison for intentional homicide. That's exactly what I wanted, cause Victor was locked up in the same facility. But the moment I arrived, warden called me into his office. He knew why I was there and warned me not to cause trouble. He said Victor was his man now, and if anything happened, he wouldn't let anyone off the hook. Victor got word that I've been locked up, but he wasn't worried. This was his turf. This is my house. The next day, I got jumped by several guys in the laundry room. I could handle myself pretty well, but I couldn't take on multiple attackers at once. They eventually beat me down. Lucky for me, a guard showed up just in time. A few days later, I Learned from a guard that Victor had a deal with the warden. They were running some dirty business together. Victor used his connections to help the warden turn a profit, and in return, the warden kept him safe. I didn't say much after hearing that. No matter how much power he had, nothing was going to stop me from avenging my wife. Back in my cell, I started putting my revenge plan into action.

He spit on the window and then started jumping on the hood with all his strength. But what he didn't know was that there were kids inside and one of them called the police. Within 30 minutes, he was caught and sentenced to three years in prison. This is one of the best instant karma clips I've seen. This truck pays the toll like normal and goes on its way. But the next truck behind it thought they were too important to pay the toll and tries to sneak by. The trucker breaks right through the barrier, but then look what happens. He blows out several tires. That's gonna cost him a lot. Plus any additional fines for skipping the toll. There's probably a pop up band. How fast did you pass the cop? Like 90. Five hundred. Everyone was puzzled when a police officer told the crowd to keep it down. At first it seemed like they were just responding to a noise complaint. But what no one realized was that the officer had a completely different plan in mind. What they did next was so unexpected it completely flipped the situation around. When this biker had a life threatening close call because of a reckless driver, he Was absolutely furious and turned around to confront him. But what happened next was insane because the driver blamed the biker. Look, I got kids in my motherfucking truck. Did you see what the fuck you just said? I don't care. But then his friend showed up. The driver turned out to be the biker's neighbor. While this biker was cruising down the road, he suddenly came across a truck spraying water all over to clean it, which was a serious problem because if he rode through it, he'd lose control and crash in instantly. So he started honking like crazy trying to get the driver's attention, but the driver completely ignored him and kept going. But then a random euros driver pulled up and did something unexpected that completely made the bikers day.

Before the man could react, one monster grabbed his arm. Levi, when the woman saw this, she kicked that monster off the cliff with all her strength. But just then, thousands of monsters swarmed toward them. Their car was about to collapse under the weight and fall. The man quickly handed a wooden box to the woman, telling her to jam the car's accelerator with it. The car automatically climbed up along the cliff. But before the two could catch their breath, the monsters attacked again. The man picked up a large machete, swung it wildly and fought against the monsters. It the monsters climbed up, they would be trapped here. The woman also showed no fear. She picked up an axe and chopped at the monsters. They knocked all the monsters off the cliff, but before they could recover from the shock, suddenly another monster rushed over. No. Luckily, the man grabbed the guardrail in time, but the monsters kept swarming in waves. So the man made a brave decision. He took out a small knife and stabbed it deeply into the fuel tank. Gasoline immediately flowed toward the monsters. The man didn't hesitate for a second. He quickly climbed onto the car, opened an incendiary bomb and threw it down. The flames triggered a chain reaction. The monsters were soon burned to ashes. But when the flames spread to the fuel tank, the tank exploded, blowing the monsters into the air. Luckily, The two dodged the explosion with their agile movements to completely eliminate all danger. The woman cut the steel cable completely. They finally got rid of the monster's attack completely.

Thankfully the baby came through without a hitch. But the woman stared in sheer terror. She noticed the child's face looked eerily like the rapists. Her therapist dismissed it as pure delusion. She insisted the attackers fluids had tainted her unborn child. As the kid grew up before her eyes, she couldn't shake that filthy nightmare. One gloomy morning, she finally snapped. The broken woman leaped off the building with the child in her arms. After his wife's death, her husband, a psychiatrist, shattered completely. Yet he soon found a reason to keep breathing. The rapist had only gotten four years behind bars. And when he spotted the guy in court, a sneer curled at the corner of his mouth. Alan vowed revenge. He dove into ways to make someone suffer endlessly without letting them slip away into death, all so the bastard could writhe in agony four years from now. But on the day of the thug's release, he Learned the man had fried in a prison electrical mishap. Alan plunged back into bottomless despair until one patient's story pulled him out. It gave him fresh purpose to endure. The patient's wife had been killed by a drunk driver. His eight year old son lay in a vegetative state. He lode the culprit with every fiber, but his boy's condition held him back from vengeance. Alan saw his own shattered self from four years ago. So he asked the man. Point Blank, want me to take out the driver for you? Alan drugged the perp and tied him to a cross. He approached with a hammer in hand. The driver gaped in raw horror. At the scene, Alan met his gaze with icy detachment. Then he swung the hammer and bashed the man's skull in. As the patient watched his enemy bleed out, a genuine smile broke across his face. At last, the doctor felt the sweet rush of redemption. Over time, he treated 10 more patients, crushed by trauma. Each time he had to end someone's life. He became the nation's most notorious serial killer. That day, Alan reached out to a female reporter. He confessed outright that he was the killer and requested a private one on one interview. The reporter showed up with a detective in tow at a quiet hotel downtown. Alan had booked the room under her name. During check in, she clocked that all the security cams were down for repairs. Before stepping inside, she slipped the spare key card into the elevator, then ducked into the bathroom. She tucked a tiny earpiece communicator into place and covered it with a sweep of her hair. It was her only lifeline to the cop. The reporter entered room 27, 0, 1, while the detective slipped into 2,601 below. He planted hidden cameras all over the space so he could watch every move inside. Then they settled in to wait for Alan's arrival.

I was the only one who actually cooked in our four person house. Every Sunday, I spent hours preparing healthy meals for the week. My three roommates survived on delivery apps and whatever they could steal from my containers. It was just missing Tupperware. Jeff would shrug after eating my chicken and rice, sorry, I was drunk and hungry, became his favourite excuse. Soon, entire rows of meals would vanish overnight. My grocery budget evaporated into their stomachs. They still complained about being too broke for groceries. Bieber was the worst offender by far. I spent three hours one Sunday making lasagna for the week. He ate the entire tray while I was at work. When I confronted him, he just laughed in my face. Maybe if you weren't obsessed with containers, you'd find someone to cook for besides yourself. Bieber's girlfriend, Taylor, basically moved in without paying rent. She didn't just eat my food like the others. She photographed my meals for her Instagram before destroying them. Her captions claim she made everything herself. She promoted her meal prep journey while eating my entire week's food in two days. My containers would disappear into her car for weeks, return stained, warped and sometimes mouldy. I tried the polite approach. One evening I asked if they could reimburse me for groceries. Taylor rolled her eyes dramatically at my request. It's just food. You're Being really weird about this. Never. Immediately took her side without hesitation. Yeah, stop being so territorial. Sharing is caring, right? Our house meeting was my final attempt at reason. I spend $80 weekly on groceries. You guys eat most of it. Can we please work out a system? Jeff jumped in with his prepared complaints. Your meal prep takes up the entire fridge. Maybe stop hoarding space with containers. Then we'd have room for our own food. Bieber grinned and added his support. Exactly. Stop filling the fridge with your stuff. Problem solved. They actually high fived each other. I stood there processing their audacity. Something shifted inside me at that moment. I smiled sweetly. You know what, you're absolutely right. Malicious compliance became my new favourite recipe. I stopped using containers immediately. Just as requested. Every night I cooked elaborate aromatic meals instead. The house filled with smells of garlic, herbs and sizzling meat. I made exactly one portion and ate it immediately. Nothing went in the fridge ever. The kitchen.

Everything went straight into my new lockbox. I kept it all in my bedroom. The fridge remained completely empty of my food. They had all the space they demanded. The psychological warfare intensified over the following days. I timed my cooking for when they were hungriest. Sunday football meant buffalo wings and loaded potato skins. Stommy's growled audibly over the game. I ate slowly, savoring every single bite. Game night with their friends became my masterpiece performance. I cooked an entire feast for hours. Wings, nachos and spinach, artichoke dip filled the air with incredible smell. They finally broke and asked for some. I reminded them sweetly about their request. You said I was hoarding the fridge. Everything's in my room now. You have all that space you wanted. Their friends stared in complete disbelief. The situation required an awkward explanation.

I was the only one who actually cooked in our four person house. Every Sunday, I spent hours preparing healthy meals for the week. My three roommates survived on delivery apps and whatever they could steal from my containers. It was just missing Tupperware. Jeff would shrug after eating my chicken and rice, sorry, I was drunk and hungry, became his favourite excuse. Soon, entire rows of meals would vanish overnight. My grocery budget evaporated into their stomachs. They still complained about being too broke for groceries. Bieber was the worst offender by far. I spent three hours one Sunday making lasagna for the week. He ate the entire tray while I was at work. When I confronted him, he just laughed in my face. Maybe if you weren't obsessed with containers, you'd find someone to cook for besides yourself. Bieber's girlfriend, Taylor, basically moved in without paying rent. She didn't just eat my food like the others. She photographed my meals for her Instagram before destroying them. Her captions claim she made everything herself. She promoted her meal prep journey while eating my entire week's food in two days. My containers would disappear into her car for weeks, return stained, warped and sometimes mouldy. I tried the polite approach. One evening I asked if they could reimburse me for groceries. Taylor rolled her eyes dramatically at my request. It's just food. You're Being really weird about this. Neither immediately took her side without hesitation. Yeah, stop being so territorial. Sharing is caring, right? Our house meeting was my final attempt at reason. I spend $80 weekly on groceries. You guys eat most of it. Can we please work out a system? Jeff jumped in with his prepared complaints. Your meal prep takes up the entire fridge. Maybe stop hoarding space with containers. Then we'd have room for our own food. Bieber grinned and added his support. Exactly. Stop filling the fridge with your stuff. Problem solved. They actually high fived each other. I stood there processing their audacity. Something shifted inside me at that moment. I smiled sweetly. You know what? You're absolutely right. Malicious compliance became my new favourite recipe. I stopped using containers immediately. Just as requested. Every night I cooked elaborate aromatic meals instead. The house filled with smells of garlic, herbs and sizzling meat. I made exactly one portion and ate it immediately. Nothing went in the fridge ever. The kitchen.

What are you talking about? I have appendicitis, mom. I had Katie drive me here this afternoon. I was in so much pain, I could barely move. I called you and dad. Neither of you picked up. Elizabeth, I'll come to see you once your father gets home. Benny can't stay home alone, and the hospital scare him. Your father should get back in about two hours. Can you hang on until then? Don't let them do any procedures on you until I get there. Mom, are you serious right now? Excuse me? Ben is 12, mom. 12 years old. He can stay home alone. He's not a little baby anymore. He can entertain himself. He doesn't need to be connected to you at the hip all the time. Or tell him to grow the hell up and just come to the hospital. If it was Ben in the hospital, not me, you'd be here in a heartbeat. You'd drop everything, leave work, leave anything. Elizabeth, how dare you talk to me that way? How dare you be so selfish? Have some respect, mom. You don't understand. You don't respect me. You don't care about anything that I love. You only care about Ben. Do you even love me, mom? Oh, Elizabeth, you haven't noticed a single thing about my life in years. You haven't even bothered to care. Mom, you haven't noticed that I have a girlfriend? Mom, we've been dating for a year. Now, we went to prom together, but you make me leave early to pick up Ben from a sleepover because he forgot his iPad at home. My girlfriend and I got into the interview recently. It's on the school website. But you never even watched it. Elizabeth, please let me talk. I'm packing a bag right now. I'm going to bring Ben to his friend's house and head to you. No. All you do is talk, and all I do is listen. I'm done. Mom, I want you to hear me. Please, Mommy, hear me. I'm listening, Beth. I'm listening. I hate myself. I feel like I'll always be nothing. You've made me feel like I'll forever be nothing. Like I'll never matter. And honestly, maybe I won't ever matter. I've spent so much time adjusting to what you need me to be, what you expected of me. I stopped even caring if I liked myself. And I don't. I hate myself. And I hate that all I do is please other people. Beth, I'm on the way right now. Please just wait until I get there. We can talk, okay? Actually, no, I will listen. I will. I promise. And you talk. I'm sorry. I know I should have said it sooner. Yeah, you're right. You should have. And it's too late for sorry. At least this way, you can finally put that college fund of mine towards Ben's dreams like you've always wanted to. Elizabeth, what are you Talking about. What are you doing? Elizabeth? Elizabeth? Elizabeth, please answer me. Beth, please pick up the phone. I'm five minutes away. Mommy. So sorry.

Don't tell me you forgot what today is. Mom, not now, please. My girlfriend Anna is in labor. We're at the ER. Our baby is coming. So you did forget. I guess your little girlfriend made sure of that, huh? Of course she'd go into labor today on my birthday. What a coincidence. Are you serious right now? You think Anna planned this? She's going through it right now. The doctor said they don't know if she'll be okay. Oh, please. That girl has always had a flare for drama. She does this every stinking time. Every time I try to see you, something urgent comes up. I haven't seen my sweet boy in months. Mom, you really think she's faking this to make me miss your birthday? Are you actually that jealous of her? I see right through her. She's been trying to pull you away from me since the moment she met you. Last time you missed dinner because of period cramps. Oh, please. That girl will say anything to keep you from spending time with me. Are you out of your mind? Anna is about to risk everything, bringing in your grandchild, and you're going on some jealous rant? Don't yell at me. You wouldn't even be here if it weren't for me. I carried you. I raised you, and you're choosing her over your own mother on my 50th birthday? Because this is serious. Anna could lose it all, and you're crying about cake? And candles. That girl stole you. She made you cold. You used to call me every night. Now I have to beg to hear your voice. Do you know how that feels? I'm not a little boy anymore. I'm a father now. And you refuse to accept that. You changed the day you met her. You stopped coming over. You didn't show up for the family cookout. You said you were tired. But I know it was her. And now I spent weeks planning this birthday dinner. Everyone's here. Your uncle, your aunt, even grandma. And my son's seat is empty. Did you even freaking hear what I said? The doctor said Anna's fate is uncertain, and you're talking about a dinner? You were my baby first. All I wanted today was a hug from my son. One picture, one memory. You think your little family matters more than the one that raised you? That is the most selfish thing I've ever heard. You're evil. You want me to leave the woman I love? Well, she's fighting for everything. Just so you don't feel left out. Cantina. Ask. Bring Robert. Help me cook. My son for choosing his girlfriend over his own mother. Tell him. Bro really peed his pants at 16 and thinks he's grown. If your girl knew she'd vanish, but mommy still cleaned it up. Bro really peed his pants at 16 and thinks he's grown.

I want the boy who made me laugh, the boy who asked me to braid his hair, who watched Disney movies with me on the couch. Now all I see is this bitter, distant man, and it's all because of her. Wow. You know what? I hope one day you realize how insane you sound. And until that day comes, I never want to talk to someone as selfish as you again. You don't mean that. Please tell me you don't mean that. Chris. Chrissy, baby, don't do this to your mama. Chrissy. You selfish, freaking brat! Do you even realize what you just did to your mother? Dad, not you, too. Are you really siding with her on this? Anna is in labor. Don't you dare try to flip this. You hurt your mother on her 50th birthday. She'll be fine. She always does this. I'm sorry, but I had to stand up for Anna. No, she's not fine. She. He's in the ER. What? What are you talking about? After you told her you never wanted to see her again. It hurt bad. I had to take her there. Oh, my god, dad, I didn't mean for that to happen. Don't give me that crap. You know your mother has. You knew what you were doing when you did that, and for what? Some freaking cake? Anna is in labor! They Don't know what will happen. I had no choice. There's always a choice. And you made yours. Don't call me dad anymore. It's Peter to you now. Dad, no.

Your mom called me asking if I knew where you were. I told her you were in my house, in the bathroom, just to cover for you. But seriously, where are you? It's been a day now. Elio. Your mom's freaking out, and honestly, so am I. She called the police. I haven't told them that I lied for you. I keep telling her you're here, but I have no idea where you are. Please come home. I'm getting really worried. I asked my favorite astrology app, Astro App, for advice and it said that I'm a cancer, so I can get really emotional when I feel abandoned. It told me to take deep breaths and focus on grounding myself so I can stay calm and clear minded while waiting to hear from you. Elio, it's been a week. Everyone saying you're missing. Like actually missing. Your mom's been crying non stop and they filed a police report. Where are you? What's going on, Ello? It's been a month now. They still can't find you. I don't even know what to tell people anymore. I got a cat to help with the loneliness, I guess. I named him Charlie. Figured you'd like that. Wish you could see him. She's really sweet. Sleeps with me every night. She and was born on Valentine's Day too. Hahaha. It's been two months since you disappeared. I stopped writing to you because it felt like screaming into the void. Your mom's pregnant. Can You believe that? Guess there'll be another Elio around soon. I miss you so much, Elio. 10 months now. Your sister's almost here. Her name is going to be Julia. I keep hoping you'll walk through the door before she's born. Ello, it's been two years. I know that sounds insane, but part of me still thinks you're coming back. I can't move on from this. Everyone tells me to, but I can't. It's like a piece of me went missing with you. Hey. I need to tell you this. I'm getting married. I found someone who loves me. I think you'd like him. He's the love of my life. And I'm finally getting married. I asked for star rings so you'd be here with me in some way. I miss you more than ever right now. Ilio. It's been five years. I don't know what to say anymore. But I'm still here. They closed your case, the police. No one's looking for you anymore. But I'll never stop. I'm thinking of searching for you on my own, but in secret. Oh, and I'm pregnant. It's a boy. I'm naming him Ilio, after you. Hey. Wow. I didn't even realize we're still having this conversation. It's been seven years. My son's been born. Look. I think he looks a bit like you. He's as cute as you were. Or maybe that's just me imagining things. Wish you could see him. Hey, Elio. It's been 11 years. He's turning four today. Time flies, doesn't it? Feels like yesterday when I last saw you. He really admires you, you know. I always tell him how great you were as a boyfriend. He says you're still alive, that we're so connected. That's why I feel like you're still around. But I don't know. Sometimes I lose faith in you coming back. I wonder if he's right. I still feel you somehow, Ello. It's been 14 years. My new boyfriend tells me I need to move on. Says I'm holding on too tight. But my son, he still believes you're coming back. He's only a kid, but he has more faith than I do by now. It's been 20 years, Elio. Wow. My boy's nine now. He's getting so big. And guess what? I'm pregnant again. With a girl. She's due in four months, and I'm naming her Jula. Like your sister. Speaking of, your sister moved back in with your parents. She's not doing well. She barely speaks to anyone. It's like everything fell apart when you left. Elio, it's been 25 years. I built the house we dreamed of. Remember that? I also got divorced, though. He cheated on me. Now it's just me, Elio, Julia, and the cat. Still waiting for you, I guess. I miss you more than I can put into words, Elio. You have no idea. Every single day. Bria. The fuck you mean I died? I was just having some burger and fries. You're already planning my Funeral chill. You can now check part two by pressing share. Then more.

Mom, I don't mean to push, but it has been two weeks since I bought Ben's cake. I'm in charge of bringing in a food from a country. I'm studying for my history class this week. Could you please pay me back? Elizabeth, I cannot right now. Ben needed new Cleats and shin guards for practice. Mom, this class is really important to me. Please. And soccer is really important to your brother. His coaches say he has real promise. And history is important to me. Mom, I think I might really wanna pursue this.

Will you still be able to take Ben to his weekend practices? Elizabeth, I looked into your room today, and it's filthy. Your clothes are all over the floor. It's absolutely disgusting. Clean it as soon as you come home. We're going to have ants if you keep this up. Sorry, mom. Just clean it. Why are you not up? You have class in 20 minutes. Mom, my stomach is killing me. I think I might have the flu. Are you sure that this doesn't have anything to do with your science test today? I know it's not your strongest subject, but you still Have to put in the effort. I'll make up that test. Mom, I was throwing up all night. I just need the day to rest. Fine. But you're taking your brother to practice this evening. What the hell? Elizabeth? Today was your brother's tryouts, and he missed them because of you. He texted me completely upset by the situation. I specifically told you that you had to take him this evening. Elizabeth, answer me right now. Do not ignore me! Elizabeth, I know you're reading this. I just got home from work. You're not here. Where are you? Elizabeth? Elizabeth, where are you? Answer me! You can now check part two by pressing share. Then more.

My brother's wife, Diana, discovered her ultimate weapon the day she lost her first pregnancy. If someone questioned her spending, she'd clutch her stomach and call them insensitive. If anyone in the family shared good news, she'd leave the room wailing that their happiness was triggering her grief. If my brother asked her to help with anything, she'd collapse on the couch claiming the stress could cause another loss. The manipulation quickly went from tears to total destruction. First, Diana got my mom's 60th birthday party canceled by claiming the pink decorations triggered her loss. Mom spent her milestone birthday comforting Diana instead. When my cousin announced her pregnancy, Diana screamed that we were rubbing fertility in her face and claimed the shock caused her to have a panic attack. My cousin hid her entire pregnancy in shame. Then Diana wanted a 70 thousand dollar Mercedes, but my brother said no. So she staged a total breakdown at the dealership, wailing about needing a safe car for her rainbow baby and threatened to divorce if my brother didn't buy it. She didn't spare me either and went all out during my wedding planning. Diana called all my vendors claiming my flower choices would trigger miscarriages, posted on wedding forms that I was a baby killer, and demanded I change my date because it was near her loss anniversary. When I refused. She told family members that my selfishness had caused her to lose twins, and I know it might be hard to believe, but she went even further. I was four months pregnant and had managed to hide it from everyone except Diana, who'd noticed my subtle changes. One morning, she ambushed me at a doctor's appointment with an offer that made my blood freeze. I know you're pregnant, she said calmly. Here's what's going to happen. You're going to tell everyone you're carrying a baby for me as a surrogate. You'll give birth, hand the baby to me, and I'll finally be the mother. Everyone pities me for not being. I laughed, thinking she was joking, but she wasn't. If you refuse, I'll tell everyone you've been mocking my miscarriages throughout your pregnancy. She showed me her phone with drafted emails to my employer about my workplace harassment regarding her infertility, and even had screenshots of edited text where I called her an infertile bitch. She'd been planning this for weeks. I smiled sweetly when she saw how horrified I was and added, besides, you can always have another one. Standing there with my hand protectively over my bump, realizing Diana literally wanted to steal my child, I felt rage unlike anything before. I knew Diana's weakness was her need to maintain her victim story at all costs. She'd already sent me those fake texts and threatened emails, not knowing she was handing me evidence. So I did Something simple. I scheduled a meeting with my brother at his office, saying I needed to discuss the surrogacy arrangement Diana had proposed. When he arrived, confused, I broke down crying and showed him Diana's threatening text about taking my baby. I'm scared she'll hurt herself or the baby if I don't give in. She keeps saying this is her only chance at motherhood. My brother's face went white. He checked the time stamps on her threats and said, wait, these are from yesterday morning when she was with me at the mall. The realisation broke him. His wife had been plotting to steal his sister's baby while shopping right beside him. My brother spent three days processing everything before deciding to confront her on Mother's Day, Diana's favourite stage for sympathy. Whole family would be there, including my cousin, who'd hidden her pregnancy, and my mom, who'd lost her 60th birthday Celebration. I arrived late, seven months pregnant now and unable to hide anymore. Diana's eyes locked on my belly and she began explaining how my visible pregnancy was triggering severe cramping. Classic Diana, already spinning my presence into her trauma. That's when my brother pulled out his phone. I have something to say. Diana tried to force my

I'd like to use you as a bridge and step on your face. What happened to you? You never text anymore. You never talk anymore. Ever since you went to dumb college.

It's so stupid. It's like you packed up your bags, clothes and double chin and moved out. You're already ugly at home. Why make everyone else hate you somewhere else too? Oh, and you, Take it so seriously. We're siblings. We are not supposed to be nice. That's not really true, Mark. I don't care. I hate you. I never won't hate you. I hate me, too.

Where did you hear that date? It was in the note with Dad's watch. The watch you said was destroyed. Emma, where are you right now? Still at Jessica's. Her mom's about to drive me home. Number? Go to Aunt Claire's instead. Don't come home. You're scaring me. What's going on with these texts from Dad's number? Someone is trying to manipulate you. Your father died in that accident last month. Then why is his watch here? Why does someone know about July 15th? Your father's former partner must have gotten access to his personal effects. What partner? You said dad worked alone. I needed to protect you from certain aspects of his work. There's another text. Ask about the offshore account in the Caymans. Don't respond to any more messages. They're trying to get information. Information about what? What was dad involved in? Your father was an accountant for some powerful people. He found discrepancies. Criminal discrepancies. Was dad in danger? We're in the car now. Jessica's mom is acting strange. She keeps checking her mirrors. Is she taking you to our house or to Claire's? Neither. We're heading toward the lakehouse where the text said to go. Emma, that's not Jessica's mother. The real Carol has a scar on her wrist. She's wearing long sleeves. I can't tell. Ask to use her phone. Say yours is dying. She refused. Said her battery is low, too. Try to get a look at her wrist. Find An excuse. I asked her to check the time. No scar. Mom, who is this woman? Listen carefully. When she slows down at the next intersection, unlock your door and run. She just locked all the doors from her control panel. Is there anything in the car you can use as a weapon? Jessica's field hockey stick is in the backseat. I'm 10 minutes from the lakehouse. Is she still heading there? Yes. She just got a call. She's speaking another language. Sounds Eastern European. Your father's files exposed an international money laundering operation. Dad was just an accountant. How did he get involved in this? He was recruited specifically because of his skills. He didn't know what they were hiding. She's pulling over at the convenience store. Says she needs cigarettes. This is your chance. Get out while she's inside. I can't. She took the keys and told me she'll be watching through the window. Check the glove compartment. Is there anything useful? There's a gun, mom. A real gun. Don't touch it. It could be a setup. She's coming back. She's talking to someone outside the car. Take a photo of them. Discreetly, if you can. Done. Sending it now. That's Andre Kozlov. He worked with your father's firm. We're driving again. They're taking me to the lakehouse. The watch, Emma, is there anything unusual about it? The back has a small SD card taped to it. I never noticed before. That's what they want. Your father must Have copied the evidence. Should I destroy it? No. It's the only leverage we have. It's evidence of their entire operation. We're at the lakehouse. There's a black SUV waiting. I'm two minutes away. Can you see who's in the SUV? It's Mister Peterson from Dad's office. The one who spoke at his funeral. He's the one who recruited your father. He's been leading this whole operation. She's making me get out of the car, stall, ask questions, keep them talking until I get there. Peterson says he just wants the watch and we'll be safe. He's lying. They can't leave witnesses. He's showing me a badge. FBI. Is that possible? Huh? Boost for part three.

I was 12 when a man in a blue pickup truck pulled up next to me while I was walking home from school. He asked if I wanted to earn $20 helping him move boxes. My parents had always warned me about strangers, but $20 seems like a fortune to a kid who got $5 allowance. The the moment I got in his truck, I knew I'd made a terrible mistake. He immediately locked the doors and started driving in the opposite direction of where he said we were going. When I asked where we were headed, he told me to shut up and sit still. He drove for what felt like hours to a small cabin in the woods. No neighbours, no cell towers, nothing but trees. He dragged me inside and tied me to a chair in what looked like a basement. The smell was awful, like something had died down there. For the first two days, he barely spoke to me except to bring stale bread and warm water. I cried constantly, begging him to let me go home. He just stared at me with these cold, empty eyes and said my parents probably hadn't even noticed I was gone yet. On the third day, he made a mistake. He left his phone on the table while he went upstairs to make himself lunch. I could hear him moving around in the kitchen above me. Rope around my wrists, Had loosened slightly from struggling, and I managed to work one hand free. I grabbed his phone and called the first number I could think of, my mom's work number that she'd made me memorize for emergencies. When she answered, I whispered as quietly as I could, mom, I've been kidnapped in a cabin somewhere. There are tall pine trees everywhere, and I can hear a train in the distance. Before I could say more, I heard his footsteps coming down the stairs. I quickly put the phone back and got my hand back in the rope just as he appeared. He looked at me suspiciously, but didn't seem to notice anything different. What I didn't know was that my mom had immediately called the police while staying on the line. They traced the call and started searching for cabins near train tracks in our area. Meanwhile, she kept calling his phone every few minutes, hoping I'd answer the next morning. He seemed agitated, kept looking out the windows and pacing around the cabin. I realised later that police helicopters had been circling the area, getting closer to finding us. He started talking about moving me somewhere else, which terrified me. That afternoon, he went outside to load something into his truck. I heard him talking to someone on the phone, getting angry. While he was distracted, I noticed he'd left the basement door unlocked. This was my chance. I quietly climbed the stairs and saw him through the window. Still arguing on the phone by his truck. The front door was about 15 feet away. I knew I had to be smart about this. If I ran straight out, he'd see me immediately. Instead, I crawled on my hands and knees toward the back of the cabin. There was a small window near the floor that looks like it might be big enough for me to squeeze through. I managed to push it open and wiggle through, scraping my arms and legs on the frame. Once outside, I ran as fast as I could toward the sound of the train tracks. I figured if I could reach them, I might find help, or at least know which direction LED back to civilization. My legs felt like jelly from being tied up for days, but pure adrenaline kept me moving. After running for about 10 minutes, I heard dogs barking in the distance. Then I heard voices calling my name. It was the search and rescue team my mom had called in. I screamed as loud as I could and kept running toward the voices. A police officer

Or are you calling her a liar? Listen, Cameron, I hope you find your little monster that you call a cat. I have things to do and places to be, so I'm going to end this conversation here. Cameron, I know we aren't on the best of terms right now, but there's an emergency. Yeah, Lucy, I would say not on the best of terms is putting it lightly, since it's been one week and Coco is still missing. There's a more important problem. My son miles was playing with his ball outside and didn't come home this evening. I'm so worried. Oh, no, that's horrible. I don't know anything about it, unfortunately. And I don't see why that's a more important problem. Susan from across the road is saying the last time she saw him was this morning going into your backyard to get his ball, and she never saw him come out. Are you calling her a liar? Listen, Lucy, I hope that you find your little rat that you call A son. I have things to do and places to be, so I'm gonna end this conversation here. You can't use my own line on me. Give me my son back. You er

That's impossible. Your father's phone was destroyed in the accident. It says, come to the lake. I'm waiting. When did you get this? Just now. Three minutes ago. Block that number immediately. Why? What if it's really him? Your father is dead, Emma. We buried him last month. But what if it wasn't him in the casket? What if. Stop! The police confirmed it was him. There's another text. I know you're reading these messages. Someone is playing a cruel joke. It says, ask your mother about the cabin key. What? What cabin key? Mom, how would they know about that? Know about what? Mom, you're scaring me. Where are you right now? At Jessica's house. Why? Stay there. Don't go anywhere. I'm coming to get you. The text says she's lying to you. She's always been lying. Turn off your phone now. Mom, there's someone outside Jessica's window. Lock the doors. Call 9 1 1. They're wearing Dad's jacket. That's not possible. His jacket was in the car with him. Unless it wasn't him in the car. Emma, listen to me. Whatever you do, don't open the door. They're holding something up to the window. What is it? It's. It's Dad's watch. The one you said burned in the fire. That's not possible. Mom, what's going on? Why did you lie about the watch? I didn't lie. I thought it was destroyed. Jessica's mom just got home. She's going to The door. Tell her not to open it. She already did. There's no one there. Check the window again. They're gone. But they left the watch on the porch. Don't touch it. Too late. There's a note inside. What does it say? Ask her about July 15th. Boost for part two.

How's it going? Um, hi. Who's this? I can't tell you that, but I go to your school. We've never talked, but I've had a crush on you since middle school. If you had a crush on me for so long, why have we never spoken? Because I'm scared. And I don't know if you would feel the same way. Why don't we play a game? Okay. What kind of game? You have until July to figure out who I am. Is this an excuse to get me to talk to you for the whole year? Pretty much. Why not? I do need to let you know I already have a crush on a girl in my school, so don't get your hopes up. That's fine. Let's see what happens. Hey. You looked hot today. You were watching me? It's kind of weird. Rizz app respond with how could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? How could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? Wow. That actually made me feel good. At least give me clues about yourself. Why? So I can at least get a starting point on who you are. Fine. I am blonde. That doesn't help me. There are lots of blonde girls in our school. Be more specific. I have a birthmark on my neck, so I have to go check every blonde girl's neck. Ha ha. So tell me about this girl you Like her name is Violet. She's perfect. We have never spoken. Sadly. Do you know her? Violet? Oops, sorry. I do know her. Maybe when I find out who you are, you can introduce me to her. You can ask her right now and she will say yes. How can you be so sure? I'm too scared to ask her. Don't worry. She is nice. Okay. Good night, mystery girl. I'm going to get some sleep. Good night. What? I don't get a message today. Ah. Does someone miss me? In your dreams. I was just surprised how my crush since middle school hadn't messaged me today. I have a question for you. Or ask away. How could you have loved me for so long if we haven't spoken ever? You are handsome. The way you talk to people. You are such a kind soul. Polite. You make everyone laugh. You are a gentleman. I always knew you are what I always wanted. Now I really wanna know who you are. Patience. Hey. Hey. Can I admit something to you? Sure. I'm not interested in Violet anymore. Really? How come? She's beautiful. So beautiful that I was too scared to even go near her. That's the issue. She's perfect in every way. But I have fallen for someone else. Someone who I do speak to. Someone who understands me. Someone without a name or a face, but someone who loves me. The day you find out who I am, I Hope we will be together. Me too. Mystery girl. Can I confess something to you? Sure. What's up? I think it's time to tell you who I am. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

You ask too many questions. Just come. No, I'm in camp, too. Yeah, but mine is summer school, and that's more important than yours. Well, mine is still more important than chick fil A.

I know how mom made you. Thank you very much. Bro, you're so pressed. Unlike your nose. That thing is the opposite of flat. You can't talk. Your nose is like a bridge. I'd like to use you as a bridge and step on your face. What happened to you? You never text anymore. You never talk anymore. Ever since you went to dumb college. Whenever I mess around about something, you take it seriously. I'm just kidding. Obviously. Hello? I know you can read this, you hole. You wouldn't know. You're barely 8 years old. I'm literally 13, bro. I hate you. I love you too. Happy birthday. I don't care. You don't even come over on holidays anymore. Why would I respond to you? Okay, why are you so different? It's so stupid. It's like you packed up your bags, clothes and double chin and moved out. You're already ugly at home. Why make everyone else hate you somewhere else too? Oh, and you, Take it so seriously. We're siblings. We are not supposed to be nice. That's not really true, Mark. I don't care. I hate you. I never won't hate you. I hate me, too. Oh, it's my fault, right? My fault that you're gone. I'm in high school now. I understand now that you were insecure and I truly was a jerk. Brody died today. I read our texts and cried.

So if I were you, bro, I would be careful. He raised an eyebrow and explained that he was only there to get free food and to try to make me jealous enough to give her another chance. It was the stupidest thing I had heard. I looked over at my ex's face was super red with embarrassment and realized that it was actually true. I felt a serious rush of ego boost, but at the same time, I felt something unexpected too. Like, dude, call me stupid. But I felt pretty touched that she would go this far just to try to win me back. It definitely wasn't the best way to win me back, but definitely creative. So I told her jokingly that if she really wanted me back, she should try showing up here alone for another month to prove that she really meant it. I walked off to finish the rest of my shift. After that, she really did show up every day with a book or journal sitting at the same booth waiting for my shift to finish. I didn't even really talk to her much and she still came around. Weeks went by and on the last day of the month, she walked into Waffle House with a huge smile on her face. I walked over with her usual order and sat beside her in the booth. She asked me, If I would finally be her boyfriend again. I smiled back and said, absolutely not. I reminded her that she cheated on me with several guys and one of them was my best friend. She picked up the glass of water and thought about splashing it all over me. Instead, she splashed water on her own face to wake herself up and left, angrily ripping up one of the menus in the restaurant out of frustration before walking out the front door. The entire angry scene was crazy cute, like, ah, there goes my little Harley Quinn. I grinned and told my manager that I was finally quitting. I chased after her and apologized, saying that I wanted to get back at her a little for the horrible mess she put me through before I unzipped my jacket and wrapped it around her head to help her stay warm. After seeing water still drip down from her hair, I took her home that night and we talked about setting new boundaries if we wanted the relationship to work better this time. To this day, we're still together and no longer the toxic kids we used to be. Also for our prenup, we had a fun photo shoot at that same Waffle House, forever reminding us of our ridiculous and petty days.

I work at a Waffle House as one of the cooks and my ex girlfriend likes to come around and set up each of her dates there only when she knows I'm working. It had been four months since our breakup, so I didn't really understand why she would waste effort coming around and showing off that she could easily land a guy. It really bothered me at first watching her laugh and enjoy each date just like how we used to. I even thought about burning their food or putting something weird in. I settled for making their food extra salty for fun. After seeing the 3rd and 4th guy, I got used to it and just treated them like another customer with no connection to me. Eventually, my ex girlfriend settled with a guy I like to call Beanie based on the black and green beanie had he liked to wear on every date. They visit Waffle House about twice a week after class. I wasn't really suspicious about their relationship or anything until I was given a different shift. They ended up changing their meal time to match my schedule. That's when I started to really think about why they kept coming around and why they needed to go out on a date while I was there at work. Like, was I really that great of a chef here? So during my break one time, I decided to Walk over and ask them why they kept coming around to have a date specifically. While I was on the clock, my ex girlfriend sipped on her Sprite and asked, what do you mean? Are you saying we're doing this on purpose? I nodded and said, yeah, that's exactly what I was implying. She sighed and leaned back in her seat, crossing her arms before looking up at me and asking, are you just jealous? I sighed, feeling like I wasted my time and said, why would I be jealous when I'm the one who broke up with you in the first place? Her mouth flung open to argue back, but I tired my attention to Beanie and said.

Two weeks ago, I come home from soccer practice and my dad is sitting on my bed holding my laptop open. He's not yelling, just staring at the screen with this look I've never seen before. I freeze because I know exactly what he found. My YouTube channel. For 8 months I've been making comedy videos after school, just me doing impressions of teachers and sketch just about classes. Nothing insane. But I got to 50,000 subscribers and brands were messaging me about sponsorships worth $5,000. I never told my parents because my dad always goes on these rants about how Youtubers are lazy and don't contribute to society. So I kept it secret and said I was studying at the library. Finally looks up at me and his voice comes out way too calm. This is what you've been doing. People from my office have seen these videos. Their kids showed them. I didn't realise kids from school were watching. My dad closes the laptop and stands up. I'm taking this and you're done with whatever this is. I need that for homework though. You have your phone. Use that. He walks out with my laptop. The next few days I try filming on my phone but the quality what is terrible and I can't edit anything. My subscribers start commenting, asking where I went. A brand emails about working together and I have to write back saying I can't that $5,000 would have covered my first year of college textbooks. Then my dad starts getting worse. He shows up to my soccer games but doesn't watch, just sits in his car to make sure I'm actually there. Every night he takes my phone and goes through my messages, my photos, my search history. One night I hear my parents arguing. My mom says he's being too hard on me. He tells her I need discipline or I'll turn into one of those internet people who never amount to anything. Six days after he took my laptop, he comes home from work early and his face is bright red. He's gripping his phone so tight his hand is shaking. He storms to my room where I'm doing algebra homework. You're still making videos. I'm confused because I haven't posted anything. He shoves his phone in my face and it's playing a video, but it's not mine. Some other person made a reaction video to my old content and they're doing impressions of my dad using clips from my videos where I joked about his strict rules. The video has 2 million views, way more than any of mine ever got. The comments are brutal. People calling my dad a control freak and making memes. I swear I didn't make that. I tell him someone else took my stuff. He doesn't believe me, starts yelling that I'm trying to destroy his reputation.

The finding out was biblical. I show up to practice Thursday night at the regular time, and my three bandmates are sitting in a circle without their instruments, like they're about to hold an intervention. Lead singer says, we need to talk about the band's future. Battle of bands is in 10 days, and apparently we need to level up our image. That's when I know it's the drummer's girlfriend standing in the corner holding a bass. My bass, actually, that I let him borrow last week. She's holding it upside down. Lead singer looks at me. Look, you're great and all, but she has the look we need. She's been learning bass for, like, two months. Two months? I've been carrying this band for three years. But sure, let's get the girl who thinks a bass has six strings. They vote 3 to 1 to replace me right there with me watching like I'm getting voted off a reality show. The guitarist, who still can't play an F chord cleanly, actually says, it's nothing personal. Nobody's looking at the bassist anyway. Might as well have someone pretty back there. Nobody's looking at the bassist. I wrote half our songs, but okay, Brad, tell me more about how music works. The drummer's girlfriend tries to be nice. You can still come to the show if you want to support us. Support them. Sure. Let me buy a ticket to watch you play my bass badly. Sounds like a Dream Friday night. I don't argue, don't yell. Just say okay if that's what you all want. The lead singer seems surprised I'm not fighting back. Probably expected tears. Sorry to disappoint. They're already talking about keeping the band name and the set list for battle of bands. Acting like everything's normal. Planning tomorrow's practice like I was never even there. Like I'm already a ghost. Guitarist mentions they'll see me around and I just nod, give them a smile that doesn't reach my eyes, walk out quietly. I can hear them talking about stage positions as the door closes. How she'll look right in the back, how the judges will love having something nice to look at. They think this is over. They think I'm just going to crawl away and cry. That's cute. I'm sitting in my car in the driveway and my brain starts doing math. Tomorrow's practice. They kept saying see you at practice tomorrow to each other. But wait, that's my amp the guitarist uses because his sounds like a dying cat. My mixing board that makes our lead singer not sound like he's through a kazoo. The mic system I bought with birthday money. The cables, the stands, hell, even the extension cords are mine. I check the battle of bands registration on my phone. The song list they submitted. Breaking Chains I wrote that. Midnight Drive wrote that in my bedroom. Phoenix Rising? That's literally about my ex boyfriend. I have the notebooks. With the original lyrics in my handwriting. The van we use for gigs. Mine. Well, technically my mom's, but she lets me use it. And then it hits me. This is my dad's garage. Dad only lets them practice here because of me. I text him, hey, the band just kicked me out for not being pretty enough. He texts back immediately. Are you kidding me? They're banned. I'll change the garage code right now. My dad's the best. They kept saying, see you at practice tomorrow. They actually think they're still practicing here tomorrow. In my dad's garage. With my equipment, playing my songs. The delusion is actually impressive. Next day, five PM, I'm home.

My friends waved at me from across the room and mouth we told you, just give up. But I couldn't. That afternoon, I tried joining him on the track during pe, thinking we could maybe jog and chat together. But the moment he saw me coming, he just sprinted away like I was chasing him down with a machete. For the next few days, it went on like that between us. But here's the thing, the more I annoyed him, the more I started noticing small changes. How on the fourth day of me walking home behind him, he slowed down just enough that I could actually keep up. And when I sat across from him at lunch, he stayed and ate with his headphones in while I rambled about my day. Two weeks in, he finally cracked. When I tripped and fell onto the track, he stopped and bent down to carry me to the side of the grass and asked, what do you want from me? I felt my heart race hearing his voice. I just want to be friends with you, I said simply. He stared at me before letting out a sad laugh. You're crazy, maybe, I shrugged, but you're stuck with me now. Then something crazy happened after that. Whenever I'd walk over to him, he pulled down his headphones and actually chat with me. And slowly I started seeing glimpses of the old Ian The one who'd make sarcastic comments that'd make me laugh so hard I'd snort. The one who'd hold the door open with, without thinking about it. The one whose smile melted everyone in the room. He even started changing at school, talking to others without that edge in his voice. And I felt proud thinking I actually managed to pull him from the dark place like he once did for me. But then he saw it. We were hanging out at the bookstore when Ian reached into my bag for a pen and froze. His jaw tightened as he slowly pulled out the notebook. Why do you have this? He asked quietly. My mouth went dry. I was going to give it back, but he stood up abruptly, the chair scraping loud against the floor. You read it, didn't you? That's why you've been doing all this. I thought you cared, but this was all just some pity party to you. I do care. I stood up, too. My voice louder than I meant it to be. It's started with a notebook, but that's not why I stayed. I took a deep breath. I stayed because I fell in love with you. The words hung in the air between us. His eyes widened, anger melting. He sank back into the chair, the notebook still in his hands. This isn't my notebook. And what he said next made everything click into place. The reason why he became closed off and honestly, It broke my heart more than his answer to my confession.

I was born completely deaf and got my first cochlear implant when I turned 16. My parents had been pushing for it since I was little, but I kept refusing because I was perfectly happy in my silent world. The day they activated my implant was like stepping into an alien universe. Suddenly everything had sound, and I mean everything. The audiologist warned me it would be overwhelming, but nothing could have prepared me for the chaos. The first shot came when I walked to the bathroom after my appointment. I sat down to pee and heard this loud rushing water sound. I jumped up thinking something was broken. My mom had to explain through tears of laughter that peeing makes noise. For 16 years, I thought it was completely silent. But that was just the beginning of my sound discoveries. Walking became this weird symphony. Every footstep made noise on different surfaces, carpet with soft thumps, hardwood with sharp clicks. And don't get me started, on gravel. I spent 20 minutes just walking back and forth on our driveway, amazed that each step sounded like tiny explosions. Eating was absolutely disgusting. I had no idea chewing was so loud and gross. That first dinner, I kept asking my family if they could hear my mouth making all these wet, crunching sounds. They said yes, but you just Learned to ignore it. How do hearing people eat without being grossed out constantly? My cat Oliver became this whole different creature. Apparently, he'd been meowing at me for years and I never knew. The first time I heard him, I thought there was a baby crying somewhere. He also purrs, which sounds like a tiny motor running. Plus, his footsteps on hardwood sound like little tap dancers. The biggest shock came during my first night sleeping with the implant. I kept hearing this rhythmic thumping sound that scared me. I woke up my parents thinking someone was in the house. Dad checked everywhere before realising I was hearing my own heartbeat through the pillow. Nobody told me hearts make noise. School became a nightmare of new sounds. Pencils scratching on paper sounded like nails on chalkboards. Kids clicking pens drove me absolutely crazy. The worst was when people cracked their knuckles. I literally screamed the first time my friend Jake did it, thinking he broke something. But the most embarrassing discovery happened during lunch. I was eating an apple when this girl named Tessa sitting nearby started laughing. I asked what was funny and she said I was eating really loudly. Apparently biting and chewing apples sounds like someone stomping on bubble wrap. I've been crunching away completely unaware that everyone could hear me. The weirdest thing was learning that some of my habits were actually really annoying. I used to tap my fingers on desks when I was thinking.

But she wasn't laughing when I took her literally. I've been married to Lisa for five years. I'm an engineer making 78 k. She's a nurse practitioner making 82 k. Always pulled our money together into joint accounts. Last month, Lisa comes home from her girls night all excited. Babe Sarah and Jen both have separate finances with their husbands. We're both doing so well financially. What if we each just handle our own expenses? More independence, you know, more modern. Honestly, it sounded reasonable. We're both adults making decent money. Why not? Sure, let's split everything, 50, 50, rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, everything. She seemed a bit surprised by how specific I was getting. Well, I meant more like we each pay for our own stuff. You handle the bills you want, I handle mine. More flexible, red flag, but I agreed anyway. Maybe she had a point about flexibility. So the next day I sat down with our budget and divided everything perfectly down the middle. Rent one, $400 each. You abilities, $150 each. Internet, $50 each. Groceries, $400 each. Insurance, $200 each. Car payments, gas, personal expenses, all separate. I made a nice little spreadsheet and showed her. She said, wow, okay, very thorough, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Here's what I didn't expect. Lisa is absolutely terrible with money, always has been. I just never noticed because I've been handling all our finances. For five years, I never had to budget or track expenses. Week 2, hey babe, can you cover utilities this month? I bought this amazing Korean skincare set that was on sale. I'll pay you back next week. Week 3, my half of rent is gonna be a few days late. Had to get my car detailed and got those highlights I've been wanting. You don't mind covering me, right? Week 4, can you grab groceries this week? I'm a little short until payday. Work has been so stressful. I deserve that shopping trip. I started keeping track of every loan in my phone. Just a.

When I found out my classmate plan to take his own life, I decided to help him in the way everyone warned me not to. Ian used to be the guy everyone wanted to hang out with, the type to help freshman with algebra, then turn around and throw spirals with the seniors. The type to sit with the quiet kids because he never wanted anyone to be alone. He never cared that no one asked how he was doing. He just focused on making others happy. But last year, he changed abruptly. He stopped smiling, started getting into fights over nothing. So like everyone else, I kept my distance until he left his notebook in Class 1 Thursday afternoon. I was about to hand it over to the teacher when it fell open. The moment my eyes read what was on the page, it was too late. The handwriting was messy and desperate and the small wrinkled spots were clearly tear stains. It was the words that made my hands shake uncontrollably. I can't do this anymore. Everything hurts too much. I'm so sorry. I felt my breath stuck in my throat. There were pages and pages talking about giving up, about how it'd be easier if everything just stopped. And I wasn't sure what to do. So I went to my friends for Help. My best friend Rica closed the notebook shut and shook her head at me. Look, I know this is bad, but please don't get involved with him. He literally got suspended last semester when he fought one of his old friends and you're practically a stranger to him, she advised. But Ian helped me once. Remember three years ago when I had a panic attack during my presentation? He sat down with me in the hallway and stayed with me until I was done crying. I insist. Ricca let out a sigh while my other friend Maddie forced to smile. We know you'll do it anyway. Just promise you'll walk away if things go south. Okay? I immediately found Ian after school walking toward the parking lot with his hood up and headphones. I chased after him, basically jogging just to keep up. Hey, wait up, let's walk home together. He glanced down at me, but when I grinned at him, he gave an annoyed look and walked faster towards his house. I chased after him anyway, rambling about the weather and homework and literally anything that came to mind. When he turned on his street, I stopped and waved and yelled, see you tomorrow as loud as I could, but he never responded. The next day at lunch, I sat down across from him with my tray and smiled. He stared at me for exactly three seconds before.

They didn't come to my middle school graduation, didn't come to my high school graduation. My aunt was there for everything, cheering louder than any parent in that auditorium. When I left for college at 18, my parents didn't help with tuition, didn't help me move into my dorm. I don't think they even knew which university I attended. My aunt covered everything. Last year, Grandpa got sick, really sick. He kept asking to see his sons. My dad and uncles, aunt called them repeatedly, begging them to visit. None of them came. My aunt moved into his farmhouse to take care of him in his final months. I drove out every weekend to help. When Grandpa died, my dad and uncle suddenly appeared at the funeral, then at the lawyer's office for the will reading. Grandpa left everything to my aunt, his 150 acre farm, the farmhouse and $1 million in cash. The rest went to charity. My dad's face went white. Three weeks later, my aunt called me over. She handed me a check for the full million, said Grandpa would have wanted me to have it, that I'd spent more time with him than any of his actual sons. She told me to start the business I'd always dreamed about. I cried, not because of the money, but because someone actually cared about my dreams. Word got out fast. Within days, my phone started blowing up. Dad suddenly remembered my number. Hey, buddy, how's School. We should catch up. Mom left voicemails about how much she missed me, how proud she was of me going to college. Yesterday, dad showed up at my dorm. I have no idea how he got my address. Probably called my aunt. He stood there smiling, saying how proud he was that I was graduating this year. Asked why I never visited his house anymore. I asked him when he last called me. He went quiet, then laughed it off. You're still mad about the divorce? Come on. That was years ago. We both love you. Your mom misses you. Let me drive you home for dinner. I told him the only family I have is my aunt, that he abandoned me 9 years ago and I wasn't stupid enough have to fall for this. I know why you're here. That million brought you back, right? He put his hands up, said he had no ulterior motives, just wanted to apologize and have me back in his life. Mentioned he heard my graduation was coming up, wanted to make sure he got an invitation this time. That same night, mom left another voicemail, said she and dad couldn't afford college themselves, so they always dreamed I'd go. She's so excited I'm graduating, wants to be there for my big day. They think I'm stupid. They think 9 years of silence can be erased with a few phone calls and fake tears. My graduation is in two weeks. I'm not Inviting either of them.

After her family voted me out, I just nodded. The next morning, their own lawyer called her, his voice shaking. The vote, it didn't remove him. It just triggered Article 11, section B. God help us all. So this happened last week, and I'm still processing everything. I'm 54. Built my tech company from nothing. Literally started in my garage with a broken laptop and a dream. Fast forward 28 years, and we're worth $180 million. Along the way, I married Sarah, 32. Yeah, I know what you're thinking, but she seemed genuine back then. The board meeting started normal enough. Sarah, her brother Kyle, my C F O, and six other executives, most of them Sarah's relatives I'd hired over the years. The kind of people who smile at Thanksgiving, check their inheritance behind your back. Sarah stood up first. We've called this vote because leadership needs fresh direction. Her voice was cold. Kyle nodded like a bobblehead. The others wouldn't even look at me. Then came the vote. One by one, hands went up. My own wife voted against me. Seven to one. I was out. Sarah leaned across the table, her new diamond bracelet catching the light. You're not man enough to fight for the company you built, she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, like she'd practiced it. The room went dead silent. Kyle smirked. Jerry from accounting, the guy Whose student loans I'd paid off. Just stared at his coffee. You know what I did? I nodded once, and I stood up, straighten my jacket, and walked out. No yelling, no drama. Just the sound of my shoes on the floor. Sarah looked confused. She wanted to fight. She wanted me to beg. Instead, she got silence. I walked straight to my office, the one they hadn't touched yet. Behind a fake panel I'd installed 28 years ago was a brown leather binder. Inside was the original company charter, the one from before Sarah got her first

Asked them to show up at noon with decorations and cake. Told them to keep it secret that she thought I was out of town. They ate it up. Her mom was practically crying with joy. Said I was the most thoughtful son in law ever. Even offered to bring her famous potato salad. I left the house at 9 a m. With my suitcase, just like I said I would. Waved goodbye to her from the driveway. She blew me a kiss from the doorway. Already in her silk robe, the one I bought her for Christmas. I drove around the block and park three streets over, right where I could see our driveway. Waited in my car with a coffee and a breakfast sandwich from the Corner Deli. At 10:47 a m, a silver BM W pulled up. Didn't recognize the car, but I recognized his face immediately from the photos on her burner phone. Her project manager from work, the one she'd been texting I miss you, too. At 2 a m, while I slept next to her, I watched him walk up to my front door. Watched her answer in that same silk robe. Watched her pull him inside and close the door. I sat there for another hour, stomach turning, but I waited. Timing had to be perfect. Perfect. At 11:00am, I met her family outside our building. Her mom was holding a custom cake from the expensive bakery. White frosting with pink Flowers that said, happy 32nd birthday, Taylor. Her sister had a bouquet of balloons. Her best friend carried A bag of presents wrapped in gold paper. Everyone was grinning, so excited to surprise her. I had my key ready. Told everyone to be super quiet, that we'd sneak down the hall and really shock her. They were giggling like kids on Christmas morning. Her mom kept adjusting the candles on the cake. We walked in silent. I could hear music playing from the bedroom, her favorite playlist. Her mom was trying not to laugh. Holding that cake with both. With hands. Her sister kept whispering, she's going to freak out. Her friend was recording on her phone. We made our way down the hall. I positioned everyone right outside the bedroom door. Her mom held up the cake. 32 candles flickering. Everyone raised their party horns, fingers on the triggers. I mouthed one, two, three, and threw open the door. The party horns went off at the exact same moment her mom dropped A cake.

I knew something was off when she started working late every Tuesday. At first I believed her. She's always been dedicated to her career. But then the little things started piling up. She'd come home smelling different. Not perfume exactly, but like someone else's laundry detergent. Her phone was suddenly password protected after eight years of marriage. And she started going to the gym at weird hours. Ten PM on a Wednesday. Really? The breaking point was finding the second phone in her gym bag. I was looking for her water bottle to wash it, and there it was. A cheap prepaid phone, still logged into everything. Messages, photos, tell reservations, all of it. Here's what I Learned in that moment. Don't confront immediately. I wanted to scream. I wanted to throw that phone against the wall and demand answers. But something in me said to wait. Document everything first. So I did. For three months, I played The Perfect Husband. I screenshotted every text on that burner phone when she was in the shower. I saved receipts from hotels I'd never been to, restaurants we'd never eaten at. I tracked her late nights on a calendar, built an air tight case and handed it all to a lawyer. My attorney loved me. Said most guys come in with nothing but suspicion. I came in with a legal nuclear weapon. Her birthday rolled around in October. Three months into My silent investigation. I asked what she wanted to do, and she got this strange look on her face. Said she wanted me to go visit my brother for the weekend. Said she just wanted a quiet day at home. Maybe order takeout and watch movies. Didn't want to be reminded she was getting older. I knew that was complete garbage. He loves her birthday. Last year, she had a party with 40 people. That morning, I found champagne hidden in the garage. The expensive kind. $200 a bottle. Two crystal glasses wrapped in tissue paper, tucked behind the paint cans. Candles, too. The fancy ones from that boutique store downtown. She always dragged me to. Something in me snapped. But not in an angry way. In a calculated way. So I called her mom, then her sister, then her best friend from college, the one who was in our wedding. Told them all the same story. I wanted to throw her a surprise.

My 14 year old daughter started asking to sleep over at friends houses every weekend. And I thought it was just normal teenage social stuff. But then I noticed the pattern. Every Monday morning, she'd come home looking absolutely destroyed. Dark circles so deep they looked like bruises. Shoulders hunched, dragging her feet like each step hurt. When I asked about the sleepovers, she'd just mumble, it was fun and disappear into her room. Her math teacher emailed saying she had a panic attack during class when he'd casually asked about her weekend plans. Her violent teacher called to say she'd quit. Just walked out mid lesson without explanation. She lost 10 pounds in just over a month. Her favourite jeans hung loose on her hips. She barely touched breakfast anymore. Started missing Sunday family dinners, events she'd never miss before. Not even when she had the flu. My partner thought I was losing it. She's 14. Lisa, girls have sleepovers. You're being paranoid. But when I was cleaning her room, I found energy drink cans stuffed behind her dresser. Dozens of them. My sweet girl who used to drink nothing but herbal tea. My mom instincts weren't just whispering anymore. They were screaming. I started watching her more carefully. She'd get text on Friday afternoon and her whole body would change. Shoulders would tense up, face would go pale, hands would start trembling as she packed. Always the same overnight bag. But I Noticed something odd. Work gloves sticking out of the side pocket. No more family game nights on Saturdays. No more baking cookies together on Sunday mornings. No more asking me to braid her hair before bed. It was like she was being pulled away from us by some invisible force. One day, I was passing her room when I heard her on the phone. Her voice was different. Scared. Desperate, almost. I know. I know. I'll be there. Her voice cracked. I can't do this every weekend anymore. Please. A pause. No, I understand. I promise I won't tell anyone. Then I heard her crying. Real gut wrenching sobs that made my chest tighten. The next morning at breakfast, I asked casually, which friend's house are you going to tonight, honey? Her spoon clattered into her cereal bowl. Her eyes darted to her phone like it might save her. Just. Just. Marlene's. Her mom already said yes. But I called Marlene's mom last week. Marlene had been at her dad's house in another state for the past month. That's when I really started noticing her phone behaviour. When a specific notification sound played, just two quick beeps, her entire body would go rigid. Then she'd immediately delete whatever she'd seen. Something was very, very wrong with my daughter. I waited until she left for her sleepover that Saturday night. Then I did something I'd sworn I'd never do. I followed her. She didn't walk like a teenager heading to a Fun sleepover. She walked like someone heading to their execution, taking a weird, winding route through the neighborhood, doubling back twice, constantly checking over her shoulder. At one point she stopped completely, stood under a streetlight, and I watched her take deep, shuddering breaths like she was preparing for battle. She pulled out her phone and typed something. Even from my car, I could see her hands shaking as she hit send. The response must have been immediate because her shoulders slumped into defeat. Then she kept walking. What I discovered made my stomach drop to the floor. She didn't go.

I know that sounds weird coming from a white girl, but hear me out. This whole thing started about three years ago when I was living in Atlanta for my internship. My usual salon back home was like 4 hours away and I was desperate for a trim because my hair looked like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. My roommate Keisha, was getting ready to head out to her salon and saw me struggling with my messy curls in the bathroom mirror. She just laughed and said, girl, come with me. My stylist will sort you out. I was hesitant because I'd never been to a black salon before. But honestly, my hair was so bad I would have tried anything. Walking into that salon was like entering a whole different world. The energy was incredible. Everyone was talking, laughing, music playing, kids running around while their moms got their hair done. It felt alive in a way that the buy it sterile salons I was used to never did. The stylist, Miss Janet, took one look at my hair and shook her head, baby, who's been cutting your hair? Because they need to stop. She started running her fingers through it, asking me about my routine, what products I used, how I dried it. Nobody had ever asked me those questions before. They just wet it, cut it and send me on my way. Miss Janet spent two hours on My hair, two hours. She deep conditioned it, trimmed each curl individually, showed me how to scrunch it properly and sent me home with specific instructions about what products to use and how often to wash it. My hair looked better than it ever had in my entire life. But here's the thing that really got me. She charged me $40. 40. The salon back home charged.

I worked at a rage room for three years, seen all kinds of people, angry, ex wives, screaming teenagers, guys who just got fired. But this one guy, he was different. Walks in Tuesday morning around nine, regular jeans, a hoodie, beat up sneakers, maybe early 30s, looked completely normal. Face was just blank, like someone unplugged him from the world. I need your biggest room, he says. How long? I asked. All day if you let me. I explain we do four hour blocks maximum. Eight hours is our limit. He books two sessions back to back, doesn't even ask the price, just slides his credit card across the counter. Then he pulls out a thick stack of, he pays the whole thing in cash instead. He says, I wanna make sure this happens. What are you bringing to destroy, I ask. Killing out the waiver? Nothing, he says. I'll use whatever you have. So I take him to our storage area in the back. We've got tons of donated stuff people drop off. Old furniture, broken TVs, boxes of dishes, electronics, random junk from estate sales, basically whatever people want gone. He starts walking through it slowly touching things, picking stuff up, setting it back down, runs his fingers over an old dining chair, opens drawers in a beat up dresser, holds up a coffee mug, reads the bottom and puts it down. He does this for Maybe 30 minutes. I'm watching him the whole time thinking this guy's either gonna have the best session ever or he's gonna just stand there. Finally he stops in front of this bright yellow plastic toy box, one of those ones with cartoon characters all over it, pulls it out, carries it to the room, doesn't say a word, closes the door behind him. I go to the security room to watch the camera feed. He sits on the floor cross legged, opens the toy box, starts pulling out toys one by one. A stuffed brown bear with a missing eye, three or four toy cars, those wooden building blocks with letters on them, plastic action figures, a dump truck with one wheel missing. He lines every single one up in front of him in this perfect straight row like he's arranging them for a family photo. Then he picks up the bear and just stares at it. I check the time stamp. Ten minutes go by, he's still holding it. 15 minutes, 20 minutes, he hasn't moved at all, just sitting there looking at this beat up stuff bear. Finally he stands up, places the bear back in the toy box so carefully like he's putting a baby down to sleep, closes the lid gently. Everything else, though, he destroys it all. Picks up a toy car, smashes it with a hammer into dust, grabs the action figures, rips them apart, throws pieces against the wall, takes the wooden Blocks, throws them one by one as hard as he can. The sound is constant, just bang, crash, bang, crash, over and over. He's using hammers, bats, sometimes just his bare hands, grinding plastic into the concrete floor. By the time lunch rolls around, his shirt is soaked through with sweat. But he doesn't stop, doesn't even slow down. Goes back to our storage, grabs these old photo albums. We keep them as filler items from estate sales nobody wants. He carries like six of them back to the room, sits down again, opens the first one, looks at every single picture. Random strangers, weddings, birthdays, kids graduating, people who are probably dead now. He studies each one for maybe five seconds and tears it out, rips it to shreds.

He does this for all six albums. Hundreds and hundreds of photos turned into confetti covering the floor like snow. Then he gets up, grabs more stuff from storage, old laptop computer, smashes it. Trophy from some kids soccer team, bends it in half. Picture frames, glass everywhere. He works for the full eight hours, never stops, never sits down except to look at photos. The noise doesn't stop for more than a few seconds at a time. By the end, the room looks like a tornado hit it. Toys scattered everywhere, shattered glass and paper covering every surface. Pieces of plastic and metal ground into powder. But that bear still sitting perfect and untouched in the yellow toy box like nothing happened around it. When his time is up, he comes out. His hands are bleeding through the gloves, knuckles split open, shirt completely soaked. You okay, I ask. He nods, starts walking toward the exit, gets to the door, stops, turns around. My son died six months ago, he says. Car accident. He was 4 years old. I don't know what to say. Just stand there. Everyone keeps telling me I need to move on. He continue. Get rid of his things, donate his toys, stop living in the past. They say I'm not healing, they say I need closure. He looks back at the destroyed room. I can destroy 1,000 toys, he says, but I can't touch his. I can rip apart 100 teddy bears, but not the one he slept with every night. He walks back to the room, picks up the yellow toy box with the bear are still inside, holds it against his chest. Can I buy this from you, he asks. I tell him it's free. Take it. He looks at me for the first time, really looks at me. Thank you, he says. Leaves carrying that toy box like it's made of glass. Walking real slow like he's afraid he'll drop it. I watched him through the front window, put it in his passenger seat, buckle it in like a person, then drive away. Never saw him again. But I kept that exact spot empty in our storage. After that day, whenever we got toy donations, I'd put them somewhere else just in case he came back. He never did.

But she wasn't laughing when I took her literally. I've been married to Lisa for 5 years. I'm an engineer making 70 eight K. She's a nurse practitioner making 82 K. Always pulled our money together into joint accounts. Last month, Lisa comes home from her girls night all excited. Babe, Sarah and Jen both have separate finances with their husbands. We're both doing so well financially. What if we each just handle our own expenses? More independence, you know, more modern. Honestly, it sounded reasonable. We're both adults making decent money. Why not? Sure, let's split everything. Fifty fifty. Rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, everything. She seemed a bit surprised by how specific I was getting. Well, I meant more like we each pay for our own stuff. You handle the bills you want, I handle mine. More flexible. Red flag. But I agreed anyway. Maybe she had a point about flexibility. So the next day, I sat down with our budget and divided everything perfectly down the middle. Rent one, $400 each. You abilities, $150 each. Internet, $50 each. Groceries, $400 each. Insurance, $200 each. Car payments, gas, personal expenses, all separate. I made a nice little spreadsheet and showed her. She said, wow. Okay. Very thorough, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Here's what I didn't expect. Lisa is absolutely terrible with money. Always has been. I just never noticed because I've been handling all our Finances. For five years, we never had to budget or track expenses. Week 2. Hey, babe, can you cover utilities this month? I bought this amazing Korean skincare set that was on sale. I'll pay you back next week. Week 3. My half of rent is gonna be a few days late. Had to get my car detail failed and got those highlights I've been wanting. You don't mind covering me, right? Week four. Can you grab groceries this week? I'm a little short until payday. Work has been so stressful. I deserve that shopping trip. I started keeping track of every loan in my phone just out of curiosity. Meanwhile, I'm actually thriving without her impulse purchases draining our joint account. I'm in.

I've been hosting every single holiday for my husband Nathan's family for five years straight. We're talking 14 people showing up at my house expecting miracles, while his mom, Linda, parks herself in my kitchen watching me cook like she's Gordon Ramsay. Last month when I was preparing a family dinner, she followed me around the kitchen saying things like, that's not how my mother made gravy, but I guess your mother never taught you anything. Then she turned to Nathan's sister Amy and whispered loud enough for me to hear, I don't know why he married someone who can't even cook a proper meal. When we sat down to eat, Linda took one tiny bite of my perfectly roasted chicken into her napkin and announced to the whole table, this is completely dry. I feel bad for my son having to eat like this every night. Nathan just kept shoveling food in his face. Linda kept going, pushing her plate away. My mother would roll over in her grave seeing this pathetic attempt at a family dinner. That's when I set down my wine glass, smiled my sweetest smile and said, you know what, Linda, you're absolutely right. Why don't you show us how it's and make Thanksgiving This year? Everyone froze with their forks in the air. Nathan actually looked up from his plate for the first time. What Linda's face went from smug to panic, but she covered it with this weird laugh. I suppose I could show you all how it's actually supposed to be done. She spent the rest of dinner going on about her mother's secret stuffing recipe and how she'd make everything from scratch. The week before Thanksgiving, Linda called me asking, how many pounds do you think the Turkey should be? Oh, Linda, I wouldn't know since I never Learned to cook properly, remember? She called again asking, what temperature do you cook it at? Gosh, Linda, I just guess since I don't actually know how to cook. The night before Thanksgiving, she called pan making because she just remembered the Turkey needs to defrost. How long does that take? I said, someone with your expertise would know that and hung up. Thanksgiving morning, I rolled up to Linda's at 9 sharp with Starbucks. Linda answered the door already crying and still in her bathrobe. The 20 pound Turkey was sitting in her sink like a frozen bowling ball. It won't defrost, she screamed.

I said cancel the entire wedding. The call came Tuesday morning while I was editing a commercial in my home studio. This is Renee from Perfect Day Planning calling about Jared's wedding next month. Her voice sounded uncomfortable. I have some difficult news. Your family contacted us yesterday and asked us to remove you from the guest list entirely. They mentioned some family disagreements and said you wouldn't be welcome at the ceremony or reception. I paused my editing software. My family still sees me as the 29 year old college dropout who threw his life away to become a freelance videographer. What they don't know is what I actually do with all that video equipment filling my garage. However, Renee continued nervously. They also specifically requested to keep the fifty thousand dollar deposit you paid for the wedding photography package. Mrs. Ruth said the family had already allocated those funds to other wedding expenses and couldn't possibly return them. I leaned back in my chair looking at the wall of awards behind me, Emmy nominations, industry recognition, contracts with Fortune 500 company. It's my little video hobby. Had quietly become a 15 million dollar production company over the past eight years. Renee, I need to ask you something important. What's the name of your wedding venue? The Riverside Manor downtown. And who owns that property? I heard papers shuffling. On her end. Um, it's listed under Sunset Holdings LLC. Right. What about your catering company? Golden Plate Catering Services, also owned by Longer Pot Sunset Holdings LLC as well. Wait, what's going on here? The photography studio handling the wedding photos, Elite Moment Studio. Oh my god. That's also Sunset Holdings. The florist providing all the arrangements, Ella's Garden Creations. That's, that's you too, isn't it? The DJ company, the luxury transportation service, the rehearsal dinner venue, even the hotel block for out of town guests, all owned by Sunset Holdings LLC, which is my company. Renee's voice went up an octave. Mr Ruth, are you telling me that you own every single vendor for this wedding? I'm telling you that for the past eight months I've been secretly funding my brother's entire dream wedding through shell companies. I created every vendor, every service, every single detail of this wedding, all paid for by me through different LLCs so my family wouldn't know their disappointment son was actually footing the entire Bill for everything. This can't be happening. When I dropped out of film school 7 years ago, my parents told everyone I was throwing my life away. While they focused on Jared's safe marketing career at his corporate job, I was quietly building a production empire. Corporate videos, national commercials, award winning documentaries. I work with Netflix, HBO, major advertising agencies. But to my family, I'm still just a failure who plays with cameras. Sir, what exactly are You saying? I'm saying cancel everything. The venue rental, catering contract, floral arrangements, photography package, DJ services, transportation, all of it. Every single contract goes through companies I own. the wedding is in three weeks. There are.

When I was 15, my older brother Eric left home after this huge screaming match with our dad. Dad had always been super strict about everything, grades, curfew, chores, you name it. But Eric was 18 and wanted to do his own thing. You know, they got into it over something stupid like Eric staying out past midnight on a weekend. I remember standing at the top of the stairs listening to them yell. Dad was going off about respect and responsibility and Eric was shouting back about how nothing he ever did was good enough. Then dad said the words that still give me chills. If you walk out that door, don't bother coming back. Eric grabbed his backpack, stuffed some clothes in it and slammed the front door so hard the whole house shook. Mom tried calling him that night, but his phone went straight to voicemail. She left like 20 messages. Dad just sat in his recliner watching TV, acting like nothing happened. But I could tell he was waiting for Eric to come crawling back. We all were. Days turned into weeks. Mom would set an extra plate at dinner out of habit, then quietly put it away. She'd leave Eric's bedroom door open and sometimes I'd catch her just standing there staring at his unmade bed. Dad never talked about it, but he started checking his phone constantly, probably hoping for a text or Something I kept thinking Eric would show up for my birthday in October or maybe Thanksgiving when Christmas came and went with no word. I figured he was just being stubborn. Maybe he got a job somewhere. Maybe he had a girlfriend. Maybe he was living his best life and just didn't want to deal with family drama. Mom would cry sometimes when she thought nobody was looking. She sit at the kitchen table late at night staring at her phone waiting for a call that never came. Dad would find her there in the morning and they'd have these weird, quiet conversations that stopped when I walked in. Years went by. I graduated high school, started college. Sometimes I'd wonder if Eric even knew I existed anymore. I used to imagine running into him at a gas station or something and he'd be all successful and happy and we'd laugh about how stupid that fight was. I, I pictured him having kids someday that I'd never meet. The hardest part was how dad changed. He got softer with me. Like he was scared I'd leave, too. He'd ask about my friends, my classes, even offered to help with homework. He didn't understand. It was nice but also weird because I could tell he was thinking about Eric the whole time. Then I turned 21 and everything fell apart. I was at my apartment when this cop showed up at my door with an envelope they've been trying to reach My parents but couldn't get through. The letter was from the state police and it had Eric's name on it. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely read it. They'd found remains behind this old abandoned gas station about two towns over. Dental records confirmed it was Eric. The estimated time of death was about a month after he left home. Six years. He'd been dead for six whole years and we never knew. I drove home and found mom in the kitchen making dinner, like any other night when I told her.

The scratching sounds at night. Must be mice in the walls. Carol even hired an exterminator, but obviously they never found anything. Then one day, dad had an allergic reaction. His face puffed up like a balloon, and Carol went on a rampage trying to figure out what caused it. She questioned me for hours about whether I'd been near any animals. I lied straight to her face while Cheetah was literally hiding under my bed three feet away. The real drama started when Carol decided to deep clean the entire house. He was determined to find whatever was triggering Dad's allergies. I knew she'd be checking every corner of every room. I had to think fast. I convinced Annie to pet sit Cheeto for a few days. The plan was perfect, except for one tiny detail. Cheeto had scratched up the back of my closet door pretty badly. If Carol saw it during her cleaning spree, I was dead meat. So I did what any desperate kid would do. I accidentally broke my arm doing a skateboard trick right before the big clean. Carol spent the whole weekend driving me to the hospital and taking care of me instead of cleaning. Dad's allergies mysteriously cleared up while Cheeto was at Annie's. And Carol never suspected a thing. Two years, three close calls, and about 1,000 lies later, I finally moved out for college. The day I left, I smuggled Cheeto out in my laundry basket. He lived with Me in my dorm room. Against the rules, obviously. Then in my first apartment, and now he's sleeping on my lap as I type this. Dad and Carol still visit sometimes. Dad's allergies mysteriously act up every time, but he's never connected the dots. Carol still brags about how she's never allowed a single pet in her pristine house. Meanwhile, Cheeto just lounges on my couch, probably laughing at how he pulled off the greatest deception in family history.

When my dad married my stepmom, Carol, she had one strict rule. No pets allowed in the house. Carol was a neat freak who'd literally vacuum three times a day. She'd rather unalive herself than let an animal shed on her precious white carpets. But here's the thing. My dad was allergic to basically everything with fur. His eyes would swell shut if he even looked at a cat. So when I found a tiny orange kitten in the rain behind our garage, I knew I had to get creative. I built a little hideout in my closet using old Amazon boxes and blankets. Kitten, who I named Cheeto, lived there for two whole years without anyone finding out. I'd sneak food from dinner, clean his makeshift litter box when everyone was asleep, and vacuum up any stray fur before Carol's daily inspection. Getting Cheeto in and out of the house was like a military operation. I memorized everyone's schedules and had lookouts. My friend Robbie would text me when Carol left for yoga, and my neighbor Annie would warn me when she came back. I even trained Cheeto to stay completely silent whenever he heard Carol's voice. But keeping Cheeto hidden got harder as he grew bigger. Once, during Carol's surprise room inspection, he sneezed from inside the closet. I started fake sneezing and coughing to cover it up, then pretended I was coming down with something. Carol made Me stay home from school for three days, but at least she didn't check the closet. The closest call came when dad needed to grab something from my closet while I was at soccer practice. Robbie, who was over studying, created a whole diversion by accidentally on purpose spilling grape juice on Carol's new white couch. She completely forgot about the closet and spent two hours trying to get the stain out instead. I got really good at explaining away suspicious things. Random tuna cans in my trash. I'm trying to build muscle for soccer. The cat toy that fell out of my backpack. It's a stress ball for examining

This teenager getting her nails done for prom said she wished her boyfriend supported her choices like that, everyone was just rallying around me. Anna spent an extra hour making my nails absolutely perfect. When she was done, they looked like something you'd see on Instagram, long, elegant, with the most beautiful detailed artwork I'd ever seen on nails. She refused to let me pay the extra charge for all the upgrades. Took a picture and sent it to Kevin with the message, the salon thinks you're wrong. These look amazing. He immediately called me furious, saying I was being dramatic and that I made him look bad by showing strangers our private conversation. I told him I didn't make him look bad. His own words did. The engagement photos were the next day. I showed up with my stunning nails feeling confident and beautiful. Kevin's mom actually complimented them saying they looked very elegant and sophisticated. Kevin just stood there looking uncomfortable the whole time. But here's the kicker. After we got the photos back, Kevin posted them on social media without asking me. All his friends and family started commenting about how beautiful everything looked, especially my nails. His own cousin commented, those nails are perfect for an engagement shoot. Kevin tried to take credit telling people he helped me pick out the design. But I screenshot all the original text and posted them. In the comments I wrote, actually, Kevin called these trashy and tried To make me change them. Thankfully, the amazing women at the nail salon helped me realize I shouldn't have to dim my shine for anyone. The post blew up. His mom saw it and called him to ask why he would talk to me like that. His sister shared it on her story with crying, laughing emojis. Even his dad texted me privately to apologize for his son's behavior. Kevin deleted the whole post and begged me to delete my comments. But the damage was done. Everyone in his family started treating him differently after that. His mom started making little comments about how he needed to appreciate me more. We broke up two weeks later.

I was on jury duty. And the man being prosecuted was charged with burning down a farm building. Just a week before the building had burned down, the man was seen methodically moving all the valuables out of the barn. He was also seen meticulously mowing the hayfields for a 50 yards radius all around the barn to ensure the fire wouldn't spread. The day he set fire to the barn, he was seen walking around the entire thing, pouring something from a blue gas can onto the bottom of the barn walls. Not even a minute later, the entire building was fully engulfed in flames. The witness, who was the man's neighbor and had seen this entire thing, called the fire department and reported that the man had set the barn on fire. Fire department was on scene in about five minutes, but by that time the barn was already beyond saving. They did smell diesel fuel, though, and a quick investigation said it was clear arson. They arrested the man on the spot, but he refused to say anything. He also refused to talk to the DA and immediately asked for his lawyer. While on trial, the prosecution stated that they will prove the man, who was a farmer, set his own barn on fire. The barn was insured, meaning insurance fraud was the motive. They called All the expected witnesses, the neighbor, the fireman who smelled fuel, they played the 911 call, and so on. The defense lawyer did absolutely nothing this entire time. After about 40 minutes, the prosecution was finally done, and they had proved beyond doubt that the man set his own barn on fire for insurance fraud. Or so they thought. It was now the defense's turn, and the man's lawyer called the man up on the stand. His first question,

Has she even paid you back? Dude, she's my girlfriend. Hey, I'm I'm gonna spend money on her you know, I mean, I'm gonna take her shopping and stuff. Yeah. Is that all that this is about Jason? Is he spends too much money on her?

She shouldn't be cheating on you. No, exactly. That's really what we're calling to find out is if she's cheating on him you know, if she's loyal to him and he feels like spending all his money on her, what are you gonna do? That's that's his prerogative right? But if she's cheating on him, at least Jason hopes this will open Robert's eyes a little bit.

No warning, just a text. We're in Hawaii. Take care of the kids. It was a Wednesday evening in late September, just after six forty five PM I had pulled into the YMCA parking lot in Portland to pick up our four kids from their after school swim program. Normally, my wife Lauren handled pickups while I wrapped up my shifts at the hospital. But that night as I cut the engine of my Honda Accord, my phone buzzed. It was from Lauren. Just one sentence, we're in Hawaii. Take care of the kids. I blinked, reread it and sat frozen. A knock on the passenger window startled me. There they were, Ethan clutching his wet towel, Mia trying to wrestle her goggles off in Caleb and Riley dragging oversized backpacks. Four confused faces peering in. Where's mom, Ethan asked. I forced a smile, though my hands were shaking. She had something come up. I'm here. Instead. Back home, the silence was unbearable. I called straight to voicemail. I texted back. What do you mean we? Who's we? What about the kids? No reply. Not that night, not the next morning. Two days later, her sister called me. Did Lauren mention a trip? No, nothing. Her mom clueless. Her coworkers HR told me she'd requested unpaid leave three weeks earlier quietly behind my back. That's when it hit me. She planned this. Suddenly I was a single parent. Overnight packing lunches, braiding Mia's hair, fixing Caleb's broken Glasses at eleven PM, trying not to break down when Riley whispered, daddy, did mom forget us? By week 3, exhaustion gave way to anger. She hadn't just left me, she left them. One night after putting the kids to bed, I opened our shared icloud account. Lauren wasn't tech savvy and I'd set up all her devices years ago. I scrolled through synced photos and emails, praying for some mistake. And I saw it, a reservation at the Royal Chi Resort in Maui. Two tickets, Lauren and a Mark Ellis. Mark, my best friend since college, the guy who toasted at our wedding, the man who'd asked me for a five thousand dollar loan last year.

I grew up in a cult where children who scored too high on monthly IQ tests were lobotomized to preserve the social balance because smart kids grew up to question the community leaders and their divine revelations. My parents joined an intentional community when I was three, selling everything to buy into this Utopia where Brother Gabriel promised enlightenment through simplicity. He was this creepy 60 year old who claimed god spoke directly to him, but only when teenage girls gave him private massages. Inner circle of drooling devotees had all undergone divine simplification, which I didn't understand until I was old enough to notice the scars on their foreheads and their empty smiles. Mom thought their peacefulness was spiritual transcendence. She didn't realize their frontal lobes had been scrambled with an ice pick to keep them from ever questioning Brother Gabriel's increasingly insane revelations. When I was 10, it was time for me to start partaking in the mandatory monthly devil checks that Brother Gabriel required for all kids. He explained to my parents that god had revealed to him that intelligence above 120 was actually Satan, trying to corrupt young minds with dangerous questions. Any child who scored too high would receive divine simplification to return them to a state of holy innocence. He showed us videos of the procedure, an ice pick through the eye socket, while calling it a blessing. Smart children grow into doubters, he said, staring Right at me. And doubt is the enemy of paradise. My first test was next week. I Learned fast that the secret to survival was failing on purpose. But Brother Gabriel's tests were designed to trap smart kids with questions that changed based on previous answers, making it impossible to consistently play dumb. I watched my friend Lily try to fail and accidentally reveal her intelligence through the pattern of her wrong answers. Two days later, she came back from the medical building with bandages over her eyes and a vocabulary of about 50 words. She smiled constantly now and clapped when Brother Gabriel spoke like a trained seal. The parents helped enforce it. They brag about their children's low scores like they were achievements. Hazel only scored 85 this month. Praise god, my mom would say, not knowing I'd spent hours calculating exactly which answers to Miss. Who scored between 90 to 110 were safe. Below 90 raised suspicions of cheating. Above 110 put you on the watch list. Above 1, 20 meant surgery within the week. Brother Gabriel made the smart kids wear red ribbons before their procedures so everyone could pray for their healing. Never forget watching Oliver, who loved astronomy and could name every constellation, walking around with that red ribbon while his parents prepared his Celebration dinner for after his lobotomy. He kept trying to tell people about the stars, but nobody would listen because he was already marked. After his procedure, he couldn't even Remember what stars were? His parents threw a party where he sat in the corner eating cake with his hands drooling and giggling at nothing. I couldn't keep faking scores forever, so I started studying Brother Gabriel. Instead of hiding from him, I snuck into his office and found his real psychiatric files from before he started the cult. Turns out he'd been a failed neurosurgeon. He lost his license for performing unauthorized lobotomies on patients who questioned his methods. But more interesting were his financial records, showing he was embezzling millions while keeping us in poverty. I photographed everything and did something crazy. During the next community meeting, I raised my hand and asked why god needed Brother Gabriel to have three Ferraris when we weren't allowed cars. The room went silent. I kept going, asking why God's Rev.

It happened during an argument about her curfew. Carmen would let me stay out until midnight. She screamed. She actually understands me. I wish she was my real mom instead of you. I stood there in our kitchen holding the car keys she wanted, feeling something inside me shatter. Carmen, my ex husband's 20 six year old wife. The yoga instructor who bought my daughter designer clothes and let her drink wine at dinner. The cool mom who didn't enforce bedtimes or check homework. Your curfew is still 10 p m, I said quietly, slipping the keys into my pocket. I hate you! Natalie shouted. You're ruining my life! Dad and Carmen treat me like an adult! She ran to her room and slammed the door. I heard her immediately on the phone. Mom's being a total bitch again. Can you come get me? Forty minutes later, my ex pulled up in his BMW. Didn't even come to the door. Natalie dragged her overnight bag downstairs, refusing to look at me. I'm staying at Dad's this week, maybe permanently. Natalie, you have school. Carmen will drive me. She doesn't have a real job anyway. The job was intentional. I work 50 hours a week as a nurse to keep our apartment, pay for her braces, her phone, her life. Carmen teaches yoga three times a week and post motivational quotes on Instagram. After they left, I sat On Natalie's bed. Looked around her room. The walls still had the stars we painted together when she was seven. The bookshelf I built with my own hands. The quilt my mother made before she passed. But her Instagram was full of photos from her dad's house. Carmen's pristine kitchen, the pool, the shopping sprees. Captions like with my favourite person. Heart, eyes under selfies with Carmen. Not one photo of us. I was the one up all night when she had pneumonia at three. I taught her how to ride a bike, how to read, how to be kind. I worked doubles to pay for her dance classes while her father found himself in Thailand for six months. But Carmen was fun. Carmen was young. Carmen didn't make her eat vegetables or go to bed or study. Natalie stayed at her dad's for two weeks. Posted constantly about her amazing bonus, mom and their girls nights. Carmen taught her how to contour, bought her outfits I'd said were too grown up. Let her boyfriend sleep over. Then Carmen got bored. I got the call at 2:00am. Natalie crying. Mom, can you come get me? What's wrong? Dad and Carmen went to Vegas. They left me here alone. I, I think someone's trying to break in. I drove 20 minutes in my pajamas. A baseball bat on the passenger seat. Found her hiding in the bathroom, shaking. The break in turned out to be tree branches scratching the window. But She'd been alone for two days. I said I was mature enough to handle it. She whispered in the car. Carmen said it was good practice for college. You're 15. I know. Back home, I made her hot chocolate. Real cocoa, not the sugar free kind Carmen buys. Natalie sat at

Divorce finalized in October. She didn't contest anything my lawyer said. She just sat there crying while the judge signed papers. I wasn't there, did it all remotely. Five years passed. First year was brutal. Therapy twice a week just to function. But slowly I rebuilt everything. New job, became a real career, made actual friends, started rock climbing and hiking. Met Julia at a climbing gym year 3. She was patient with my baggage, listened when I needed to talk, never judged me for running. We moved in together last year into a house we bought. Last Tuesday morning, I was making coffee before work. Julia was in the shower. Doorbell rang at 7:00am. Weird but figured packaged. I opened the door. My ex wife standing on my porch in Tennessee, 900 miles from where I'd left her, holding grocery store flowers, mascara streaking down her face, looking like she hadn't slept in weeks. How did you find me? I hired someone, she said, shaking. A private investigator. Took eight months, but he found you. Eight months actively searching. My skin crawled. Why? James left me six months ago for someone younger. I've been alone and I realized I made the biggest mistake of my life. We can fix this. Start over. I forgive you for leaving. I actually laughed. You forgive me, baby, please. Who's at the door? Julia's voice behind me. She walked up in her bathrobe, coffee mug in hand, wrapped her arm around my Waist one look at my ex and she understood everything. His face went white. Stared at Julia, then at the photos on our entryway wall, us hiking at her sister's wedding, building our deck together. You moved on, she whispered. Five years ago, I said, the day I left, I came all this way. I'm sorry for everything. Can we just talk? Julia squeezed my hand, didn't say anything, just stood there supporting me. I looked at the woman on my porch, the one who destroyed me so completely, I had to flee 900 miles to survive. She looks smaller now, desperate. You hired a Pi, I said calmly, spent eight months tracking me down. So you know I'm engaged now, right? Her eyes dropped to Julia's left hand. The ring, weddings in October. Julia added quietly, you should leave. X opened her mouth, closed it, tears streaming. I loved you. No, I said firmly, you didn't. But I'm glad you found me. Now I know the 3,000 art I spent on that lawyer was worth every penny. I closed the door. Through it, I heard her collapse crying on the porch. Julia pulled me into a hug. You okay? I held her. Heard X's footsteps retreat. Car door slam, engine start, drive away. Yeah, I said, I really am.

Asked them to show up at noon with decorations and cake. Told them to keep it secret that she thought I was out of town. They ate it up. Her mom was practically crying with joy. Said I was the most thoughtful son in law ever. Even offered to bring her famous potato salad. I left the house at 9:00am with my suitcase, just like I said I would. Waved goodbye to her from the driveway. She blew me a kiss from the doorway, already in her silk robe, the one I bought her for Christmas. I drove around the block and parked three streets over, right where I could see our driveway. Waited in my car with a coffee and a breakfast sandwich from the Corner Deli. At 10:40, 7:00am, a silver BMW pulled up. Didn't recognize the car, but I recognized his face immediately from the photos on her burner phone. Her project manager from work. The one she'd been texting, I miss you, too. At 2:00am, while I slept next to her, I watched him walk up to my front door. Watched her answer in that same silk robe. Watched her pull him inside and close the door. I sat there for another hour, stomach turning, but I waited. Timing had to be perfect. Perfect. At 11:55 a m, I met her family outside our building. Her mom was holding a custom cake from the expensive bakery. White frosting, With pink flowers that said, happy 32nd birthday, Taylor. Her sister had a bouquet of balloons. Her best friend carried a bag of presents wrapped in gold paper. Everyone was grinning, so excited to surprise her. I had my key ready. Told everyone to be super quiet, that we'd sneak down the hall and really shock her. They were giggling like kids on Christmas morning. Her mom kept adjusting the candles on the cake. We walked in silent. I could hear music playing from the bedroom, her favorite playlist. Her mom was trying not to laugh, holding that cake with both both hands. Her sister kept whispering, she's going to freak out. Her friend was recording on her phone. We made our way down the hall. I positioned everyone right outside the bedroom door. Her mom held up the cake. 32 candles flickering. Everyone raised their party horns, fingers on the triggers. I mouthed, one, two, three, and threw open the door. The party horns went off at the exact same moment her mom dropped a cake.

I knew something was off when she started working late every Tuesday. At first I believed her. She's always been dedicated to her career. But then the little things started piling up. She'd come home smelling different, not perfume exactly, but like someone else's laundry detergent. Her phone was suddenly password protect. Did after eight years of marriage. And she started going to the gym at weird hours. Ten PM on a Wednesday. Really the breaking point was finding the second phone in her gym bag. I was looking for her water bottle to wash it and there it was, a cheap prepaid phone still logged into everything. Messages, photos, tell reservations, all of it. Here's what I Learned in that moment. Don't confront. Immediately, I wanted to scream. I wanted to throw that phone against the wall and demand answers. But something in me said to wait, document everything first. So I did. For three months, I played the perfect husband. I screenshotted every text on that burner phone when she was in the shower. I saved receipts from hotels I'd never been to, restaurants we'd never eaten at. I tracked her late nights on a calendar, built an airtight case and handed it all to a lawyer. My attorney loved me, said most guys come in with nothing but suspicion. I came in with a legal nuclear weapon. Her birthday rolled around in October, Three months into My silent investigation. I asked what she wanted to do and she got this strange look on her face, said she wanted me to go visit my brother for the weekend. Said she just wanted a quiet day at home, maybe order take out and watch movies. Didn't want to be reminded she was getting older. I knew that was complete garbage. He loves her birthday last year, she had a party with 40 people. That morning. I found champagne hidden in the garage, the expensive kind, $200 a bottle, two crystal glasses wrapped in tissue paper tucked behind the paint cans. Candles, too, the fancy ones from that boutique store downtown she always dragged me to. Something in me snapped, but not in an angry way, in a calculated way. So I called her mom, then her sister, then her best friend from college, the one who was in our wedding, told them all the same story. I want.

Years later, she's tracking me down, begging to reconcile after her affair partner dumped her. When I found the hotel receipts in February 2018, I didn't confront. I just sat in my car outside our apartment for two hours staring at them. Room 6 14 at the downtown Marriott. Charged to her company card three times that month. $289 each night. I went inside acting completely normal. She was on the couch drinking wine, watching TV. Asked how my day was. I said fine. Made small talk about dinner. My hands were shaking that night while she slept next to me. I opened a new bank account at a different. Over three months, I became a ghost. Transferred money in amounts she wouldn't notice. $200 here, $300 there. Started taking work trips that were actually job interviews in other cities. Tennessee, Colorado, Oregon. Anywhere far enough, she'd never look. I hired a private investigator for two weeks. Got photos of her and him at that same hotel. Holding hands at restaurants, kissing in the parking garage at her office. My lawyer said I didn't need any of it for no fault divorce. But I wanted the proof to know I wasn't crazy. Tennessee job offer came in may. Software company. 30% pay raise, full relocation package. I accepted same day and made them keep it confidential. Got a new phone with a new number. Started forwarding Mail to a PO Box in Knoxville. Found an apartment online. Small one bedroom, fully furnished. Month to month lease. Wired the deposit for my secret count. Tired movers for a Saturday in June. When I told her I had a week long conference in Seattle That morning. I packed everything that mattered while she was at Saturday. Yoga class, probably meeting him. Grandmother's pocket watch, photo albums from before we met. My two guitars, Dad's toolbox. Everything else was just stuff left her.

I blocked her number, changed mine again just to be safe. Deleted Facebook, Instagram, everything. My close friends knew what happened. I'd shown three of them the PI photos before leaving. They understood. When she started calling them trying to find me, even they cut her off. My mom talked to her exactly once. Just to say I was alive and safe and she needed to stop. X drove to my parents house the next day. Showed up crying, begging for my address or number. My dad told her if she came back, he'd call the police.

Can I use your phone to call the Uber? Mine's dead. He handed it over without hesitation. Dumbass.

My skin crawled in disgust. Next day, I watched from the coffee shop across the school as Conrad's car pulled up. Carlos's truck was right behind, then his friend Nelson. Then three more cars. I didn't recognize six of them. They'd all come running. For a 14 year old girl, mind you, they're all over 22. Conrad was checking his breath, smoothing his shirt. Then five police cars surrounded them. It was beautiful. They scattered like roaches. Conrad tried to run away before they tackled him. His face hit the pavement. Carlos tried to drive away, but smashed right into a cop car. The others didn't even make it out of their vehicles. Conrad was screaming my name as they dragged him away. Gia set me up. This is Gia. The officer looked at him and said, good for Gia. The FBI found over 2,000 photos in their drive. Conrad's in federal prison now, and I deleted hinge for good.

You'll hit it at 30. Why didn't you tell me this five years ago? Because I was scared of losing you to some office job. Thought if I got you invested in the company, Early you'd stay he the drink. That was selfish. I drove home at midnight, did the math in my head, if I went back now, I graduated at 35 years behind. Still have to work to pay for it since the $50,000 was long gone. Truck payments, apartment life. My buddy Marcus texted me the next day photo of his new house, three bedrooms just closed. I was still renting. I looked at college applications that night. Then I looked at my bank account. Then I closed the laptop. Six months later, I'm still framing houses. I'm making $32 an hour. Dad's talking about retirement, wants me to take over the business. But I've been watching YouTube videos on structural engineering, taking free online courses at night, saving every extra dollar. Maybe it's not too late. Maybe the most expensive thing dad ever bought me was five years. I can't get back. But I'm not buying into someone else's ceiling anymore, even if it's my father's. Turns out the worst investment isn't the money you spend. It's the potential you trade for someone else's limited vision of your future.

My manager saw it and whispered, don't open that. I asked, why can't you see? He said. I looked closer and froze. I didn't open it. 10 minutes later, the CEO was in my office. It was employee appreciation day at Techcore Industries. You know the drill. Stale doughnuts, motivational posters, HR rolling around with branded water bottles. I just finished an early morning call when I noticed something weird on my desk. A sleek black box. Not like the cheap gift bags everyone else got. No company logo, no bow, just sitting there like it was waiting for me. That's when my manager, Jake, walked past. He literally froze mid step, staring at the box like it might explode. Don't open that, he whispered. What? Why? He wouldn't look at me. Just mumbled, can't you see? And hurried away. My stomach dropped. Something was very wrong. I looked closer at the box. Underneath, barely visible was a label, my full name, my employee ID, and a time stamp, 203:00am. Here's the thing. Three weeks earlier, I'd noticed someone had been accessing my employee files at 2:00am multiple times. I'm a software engineer, so I'd built a simple monitoring tool that logged any unauthorized changes to my records. Just a little insurance policy. And those middle of the night edits kept happening. My performance reviews from years ago were being modified. My benefits information was changed, then changed back files I'd Never seen before, were being created with my digital signature, except I never signed them. Someone was building a fake paper trail. And I had a pretty good idea why. See, I was about to hit a major vesting milestone on my stock grants worth about $46,000. And I'd noticed a pattern. Several women over 40 in our company had mysteriously been fired for performance issues right before their stock vested. Every single one. So when I saw that time stamp on the box, 203:00am.

I deleted hinge 3 times before matching with Conrad. Unlike every other guy, he suggested coffee instead of drinks, asked about my dreams, not my body, and bought me pink roses every Friday. Everyone thought he was perfect. It was supposed to be a normal Friday night. Conrad was cooking dinner at his apartment while I scrolled through Netflix. The pink roses he brought sitting on the coffee table. His phone kept buzzing on the counter. Just the guys talking about the game tomorrow, he said, weirdly fast. You check if that's my Doordash. I ordered dessert. I grabbed his phone. No Doordash notification, but a text preview caught my eye. Did you finally do what we talked about? Something made me pause. The message was from someone named Carlos. I'd met Carlos once, Conrad's friend who gave where my hug at Energy. Conrad went to the bathroom. His phone was still unlocked in my hand. I'm typically not that girl. But I opened his messages. I scrolled past the group chat, seeing boring stuff about basketball and work complaints and I saw my sister's name. Conrad, how's it going with Lily? My stomach turned to ice. Why were Conrad's friends asking about my 14 year old sister? Conrad had responded, good, she trust me now keeps asking when I'm coming over. I scrolled up, my heart beating faster. Two weeks ago Carlos had asked if Conrad was getting Anywhere. Conrad's response made me sick. I'm only with Gia because her sister has a fat ass. But you have to play it smart. Carlos's response, 8 months is dedication, bro. Conrad, Lily's worth it. You've seen the pics. What pics? I kept scrolling a month ago, Conrad wrote, she is so naive. Meanwhile, Lily texts me behind her back, asks me for advice and sends me snaps throughout the day. The guys responded with legend and playing the long game and how much longer? Three months ago made me want to deck him. Conrad picked Lily up from gymnastics, got some good shots when she wasn't looking. Someone responded, add them to the drive. Conrad already did. Check the freshman folder. The freshman folder. My hands shook as I clicked on a Google Drive link. In their chat folders labeled by age, 13, 14, 15, inside were photos of girls in high school hallways, at gymnastics meets, in mall food courts. Creep shop.

Five years later, he asked why I never went back to school. The offer came the day after my high school graduation. 50 grand, dad said, sliding a check across the kitchen table. Cash right now. You come work for me instead of going to state. I stared at the check. My name, $50,000, signature at the bottom. I got into the engineering program. I know. And you'll spend four years learning theory while going $60,000 in debt. Or you can start making real money tomorrow. Learn a real trade. Mom was doing dishes, didn't turn around, but her shoulders were tense. It's a good school, dad. It's a waste. My company is doing $2 million a year. You could be running it someday, but I need someone I can trust on job sites now. The check sat between us, $50,000. My tuition deposit was $500. I'd already sent it. What if I want to do both? Work summers, go to school during. This is an either or offer, Cole. You want the money, you commit full time, no college. I looked at mom. She was gripping the edge of the sink. Take the night to think about it, dad said, but I need an answer by morning. Got three projects starting Monday. I didn't sleep, just stared at that check on my nightstand. In the morning, I took the money. The first year was good. I Learned framing, electrical, plumbing. Dad paid me $22 an hour, which felt like a fortune. I bought a truck, got my own apartment. My high school friends came home for Christmas break with stories about meal plans and freshman seminars. I showed them my new F1, 50. Year 2, dad made me a site supervisor, $28 an hour, more responsibility, longer hours. I was good at it, really good. The crew respected me because I worked as hard as they did. Year 3, I started noticing things. Dad's bids were getting rejected. We lost a commercial project to a firm that used computer modeling, dacted. The owner kept mentioning his son, the one with the civil engineering degree. That's just fancy drawings, dad said. We build with our hands. But the jobs kept going to the guys with the fancy drawings. Year 4, Dad had a health scare. Nothing serious, but enough to slow him down. He's started talking about me taking over sooner than planned. You'll run this whole operation by the time you're 30, he said. Better than any degree. I was making $32 an hour by then. I'd saved $40,000. I had a girlfriend, a routine, a life. But I kept thinking about my friend Marcus. He graduated last spring. Chemical engineer, starting salary.

I'll keep it brief, she promised. Just three simple questions. He leaned back, clearly amused. Go ahead. When exactly did you purchase that Mercedes? She asked. Three weeks before the storm, he answered proudly. Custom ordered from Germany. She nodded. And what was its purchase value? $94,000, he dated confidently, as our evidence shows. One last question, she said steadily. What was your insurance deductible on that vehicle? The businessman's face fell. I don't recall exactly, missus Peterson turned and made her way back to her table. She opened her folder and withdrew a document which she handed to the judge. This is a copy of Mister Harrington's insurance claim filed the morning after the storm, she explained quietly. He listed the car's value at $38,000 and received full compensation minus his five hundred dollars deductible. The insurance company has confirmed this in writing. The silence in that courtroom was deafening. From her folder she produced emails between the businessman and three tree removal companies, all dated the week before the storm. These weren't requests to remove her tree, but inquiry specifically about insurance coverage for storm damage. The businessman started the protest, but Mrs. Peterson had saved her most damning evidence for last. Presented security footage from the businessman's own camera showing him dragging additional branches onto his already damaged Mercedes the morning after the storm. This footage is time stamped 6:23 a m, approximately four hours after the tree fell, she explained. My grandson works in digital security and helped me request these records legally. Judge Reynolds reviewed everything in silence. The businessman and his attorneys whispered frantically among themselves. Finally the judge looked up. Case dismissed, he announced firmly. Furthermore, I'm referring this matter to the district attorney for investigation of potential insurance fraud. As the businessman stormed out, missus Peterson gathered her folder in Kane. I helped her down the courthouse steps afterward, and she told me she'd lived next to that horrible man for 12 years. Sometimes, she said with a small smile, people think being old means being helpless. That's their mistake, I later heard. The businessman faced insurance fraud charges and was ordered to pay Missus Peterson's legal costs. The elderly woman walked away with her dignity intact and a story that taught everyone in that courtroom a powerful lesson about underestimating people.

I was a bailiff for 15 years and saw one that still gives me chills. This wealthy businessman sued his elderly neighbour for property damage after her oak tree fell during a storm, crushing his Mercedes. He walked in like he owned the courthouse. Tailored suit, gold watch flashing under the lights, flanked by two attorneys carrying matching leather briefcases. Kind of legal team you assemble when you're not just trying to win, but trying to bulldoze someone. Missus Peterson, the defendant, shuffled in alone. 76 years old, barely five feet tall, with thinning white hair and hands gnarled from arthritis. All she carried was a weathered Manila folder and the wooden cane she needed to walk. Judge Reynolds called the court to order, and the businessman's attorney launched into their presentation. It seemed airtight. Your honor, our evidence clearly demonstrates Missus Peterson's negligence. The attorney began displaying photographs of the destroyed Mercedes. The damage was extensive. The massive oak had completely flattened the luxury car's roof. They called an arborist to testify. The tree was obviously diseased and structurally compromised for years. He pointed to cross sections showing internal decay. Any responsible property owner would have addressed this hazard long ago. The plaintiff's team presented maintenance estimates totaling 167,000, $84,000 for the total loss Mercedes, $43,000 for damage to a decorative stone wall, and $30,000 for emotional distress. When the businessman took a stand, he spoke with the Confidence of someone unaccustomed to being questioned. I warned Missus Peterson about that hazardous tree at least five times, he testified. I even offered to split the cost of removal, but she refused. Now she claims she can't afford to pay for her negligence, but that's not my problem. Throughout this entire presentation, missus Peterson said nothing. She just sat quietly, occasionally taking careful notes with shaking hands. I remember thinking how hopeless her situation looked. No lawyer, no expert witnesses. Just an elderly woman against a legal steamroller. When her turn came, she slowly rose to her feet, leaning on her cane. The businessman smirked as she shuffled toward the witness stand. The courtroom was silent. Everyone expected a rambling plea for mercy. But Missus Peterson surprised us all. Her voice was soft but clear as she asked if she could question the plaintiff if directly

My dad added, you should have packed him something. I just smiled and said, noted. When the waiter came back, I stood up and announced, I've spent most of my adult life cleaning up after my sister Jill's messes. Financial, emotional, babysitting her kids. Did it without thanks, always hearing, she's going through a lot as if I wasn't. So when I offered to pay for our parents 40th anniversary dinner, it was a big deal. I booked the best steakhouse and plan to surprise them with a restored wedding photo. I just wanted one night where everyone acted like a family. Instead, I walked into a firing squad. My son Mason held my hand as we arrived. He kept asking if it was okay to order dessert. I told him he could have whatever he wanted. Inside, Jill and her family were already seated. Her husband Doug had a drink. Their boys played games on tablets. Jill just said, oh, hey. My mom gave me a distracted hug. My dad barely acknowledged me. No one asked how Mason was. We sat down. I helped Mason with his napkin and looked over the menu with him. He pointed at the chicken tenders and smiled. I was about to flag the waiter when Jill leaned over, pulled the bread basket toward Mason, and said, we didn't order for your son, Then my dad added, you should have packed him something if you knew he'd be hungry. Mason's face fell. My mom didn't even glance up. Jill smirked. I realized they weren't going to change, but I could. I waved the waiter over. When he arrived, I stood. Please cancel any orders that haven't been sent to the kitchen. And put everything on my father's Bill. It's his anniversary, after all. You could hear a pin drop. Also, my son will have the rib eye medium rare with truffle Mac and cheese and a Coke. Make it quick. Doug coughed. Jill stared. My Uncle Gary let out a low laugh. The waiter nodded.

After a couple of minutes, I told her that she could go home. The party was over because no one showed up. She nodded and walked out the door. Then I was really all alone on my birthday. But about five minutes later, the doorbell suddenly rang. I wiped my tears and answered it. Shelly smiled and asked if it was cool if her brothers and their friends joined my birthday instead. I stared at them confused and her older brother pulled out a bottle of Sprite saying, I hope this is okay instead of a wrapped birthday gift. We didn't really have much time to prepare. I laughed at their silliness and invited them into the house. They sat on the couch and put on the robes and towels, already getting comfortable with the spa themed party. After half an hour, her brother's girlfriends and a few friends arrived as well and brought different chocolatey snacks and an entire tub of ice cream. Things were really looking up because everyone in the room was so genuinely nice and hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. All night, Maddie's brother sang a few songs together through YouTube Karaoke. Maddie showed off the craziest dance moves ever. And when it was time to blow out the candles, one of the girls brought out a small bottle that looked like alcohol but was actually a non alcoholic soda. She told me to pretend to chug it down while they take a video. So that I had something to brag about to the friends that ditched me. It was a crazy idea, but it definitely did work. The following day, when the Mean Girl crew showed up in front of me to give their excuses and fake apologies, I showed them the video of me chugging down the drink with all the college students yelling chug in the background. I shrugged and told them, well, you missed out on a lot. They watched the video over and over and scrolled through the pictures of the party. They asked me if I was going to host another party and if I could invite those adults too, so that they could also experience a cool adult party. And I said, of course I'll be inviting them because I won't be inviting any of you anymore. They flashed me a snarky look and called me rude before walking away. I didn't care because I received the best gift ever this year, being able to replace fake friends with a genuinely nice bestie named Maddie.

For my 14th birthday, I ended up getting something completely unforgettable by an unexpected friend. I planned on having a super cool slumber party where we would have a spa day at my house. My mom bought extra bath robes, different colored loofahs, MUD mask packs, nail polish kits, and foldable foot water basins. It was seriously so amazing and I made sure to thank my mom over and over for the effort she put into my party. In return, she asked me to invite one of the girls in my neighborhood. I just moved in recently as well because she had no friends yet. I thought about how my friends would react to meeting someone new for my birthday and knew they would be completely against it. I mean, we called ourselves the Mean Girl crew, so we couldn't invite just anyone to join. I asked my mom to reconsider, but she scolded me and said be nice to your neighbors, not just to your friends. Go invite her or there won't be a party at all. I groaned and created an invitation for the random girl at night. I invited all my friends the following day and told them that it was literally going to be the coolest party of the year. They gave me a skeptical look, but still took the invitations and thanked me. They walked away giggling, and I should have known by then that something was Up after school, I stopped by the random girl's house and knocked on the door. Her parents answered the door, so I gave a polite smile and handed over the birthday invitation. I went back home and my mom immediately interrogated me whether I gave an invitation to our neighbor or not. In an annoyed voice, I told her I did and went into my room for some peace and quiet. Two weeks passed and the day was finally here. I was so excited. I had everything prepared, including snacks, and had three boxes of pizza and a cake. I sat in the living room waiting for everyone to show up. The first girl to show up was my neighbor Maddie, who awkwardly said hi and waited with me in the living room. We sat around talking a bit while watching a show on Netflix. After about two hours, no one had shown up yet and I got really worried. I sent a DM to each of my friends, but no one was responding or even opening up my messages. After another hour passed, I knew that they weren't going to show up. I hugged my legs to my chest and put my face to my knees and started crying my eyes out. Maddie patted my back without asking a question, which only made me cry.

Friday came, and I was nervous. I'd accepted that maybe a handful of us would go through with it and that I'd probably be caught. But when I walked into school, my jaw dropped. Tank tops everywhere. Hallways filled with exposed shoulders. Guys, girls, everyone. Even the football team showed up in cutoffs. Some teachers stared in disbelief. Others avoided eye contact. The assistant principal tried to stop a group of seniors at the door, but they just smiled and walked past him. By second period, it was obvious there were too many of us. They couldn't suspend everyone. We got through the day. No one was punished. But the principal was furious. She called an emergency assembly at the end of the day, stood on stage fuming, demanding that whoever ran the Instagram come forward immediately or face serious consequences. Silence filled the auditorium. And then, out of nowhere, Miss Reynolds, our AP English teacher, stood up in the back. I run the account, she said, clear as day. The entire room gasped. Even I was stunned. She walked down the aisle all calm and collected and said, this dress code is sexist. I'm tired of watching female students be humiliated while their male peers are left alone. Principal didn't know what to say. She sputtered something about professionalism and investigation, but it was already too late. The entire student body was on their feet, cheering. What no one knew except me was That Miss Reynolds was bluffing. She didn't run the account. She didn't even follow it. She just had my back. The next day, the school board announced they were forming a committee to review and revise the dress code with student and faculty input. That Monday in class, Miss Reynolds handed back my essay with a smile. As she passed my desk, she leaned in just a little and whispered, nice Instagram skills. She knew all along.

Junior year I hit my limit with our school's ridiculous dress code. It always felt targeted. Tank tops, shorts above fingertip length, anything remotely distracting, instant violation. But only for girls. Meanwhile, guys strolled through the halls and sagging jeans and muscle tees with no issue. It wasn't just annoying, it was humiliating. I've seen friends pulled out of class, shamed in front of everyone, made to change or sit in the office over a strap being too thin. I decided I wasn't going to just complain anymore. I was going to do something. I made an anonymous Instagram account called at dress code violators and asked students to DM photos showing violations that weren't punished, specifically of guys wearing banned items with zero consequences. Within days the DM started flooding in. Hoodies and gym ripped jeans and class us guys with tank tops in the lunch room. I started posting side by sides. A girl dress coded for a spaghetti strap next to a guy wearing the same thing without issue. Then more stories. A girl written up for shorts while a guy in even shorter athletic ones passed by unnoticed. The account went viral in school like wildfire. Everyone was talking about it. Even students who never cared about dress code stuff were checking it daily. Teachers were whispering in the halls trying to figure out who was behind it. Some accused each other. The principal made a formal announcement. Over the P A. Anyone found to be behind the account would face suspension. They were calling it targeted harassment and a violation of school policy. That's when I launched Phase 2. I designed a simple flyer for a dress code protest that said, this Friday, everyone wears a tank top. No excuses. I printed over 300 copies and taped them in bathrooms, tucked them in lockers, slid them into textbooks in the library. I posted a countdown on the Instagram tank top Friday let's

And they finally Learned what she left them with. I married my husband when his twins were eight. Their mom had walked out two years earlier, leaving nothing but a note that said she needed to find herself. No calls, no birthday cards, nothing but to hear the kids talk. She was a saint who'd been driven away. Every family dinner was a war zone. I'd cook their favorites and they'd push the plates away. Your meatloaf tastes weird. Real mom made it better. I'd help with homework and get accused of doing it wrong. Real mom was smarter. I bought them new clothes and heard how real mom had better taste. My husband would just sigh and say they needed time to adjust. Time, like three years wasn't enough. The breaking point came on their 11th birthday. I'd spent weeks planning, decorating the house, baking a cake from scratch, inviting all their friends. When they walked in and saw the decorations, my stepdaughter started crying, you ruined it. Real mom always took us to that fancy restaurant. You're trying too hard to be her and you'll never be. I looked at my husband. He wouldn't meet my eyes. The party went on, forced smiles and whispered complaints. That night, after everyone left, I made a decision. If I'd never be their real mom, I'd stop pretending to be any kind of mom at all. The Next morning, I moved my things to the guest room. I stopped cooking family dinners and made meals for just myself. They could fend for themselves or their dad could handle it. I stopped doing their laundry, stopped helping with homework, stopped driving them to activities. I stopped buying them things. I became a polite roommate in my own house. My husband was furious. You're acting like a child. They're kids. They don't know better. But I was done. Your kids made it clear I'm not their mother, so I'm not going to act like one. You wanted a wife. You got one. You wanted a mom for your kids. You should have married someone they'd actually accept. The first week, they barely noticed. By week 2, the complaint started. There's no food in the house. Why isn't my uniform clean? I need a ride to soccer practice. I'd smile politely. Ask your dad or maybe call your real mom since she's so wonderful. Week 3, my stepdaughter's big school project was due. She'd always left things to the last minute because I'd swoop in and help. Not anymore. She failed and came home crying. My husband tried to blame me. You could have reminded her, I shrugged. Real mom would have remembered. Then came the phone call that changed everything. It was a Thursday evening, one month into my strike. The doorbell rang and my husband answered. I heard raised voices, shocked gasps. A woman's voice I didn't recognize. But the kids did. They came running down the stairs screaming, Mom, mom, you came back. I walked into the living room and saw her, their real mom, standing in the doorway with a designer purse.

So I made sure her next family reunion exposed everything. I was 23 when the endometriosis diagnosis came. Three surgeries later, biological children weren't in my future. I told my dad and tried to move on. At Thanksgiving, my stepmom decided it was everyone's business. My. My cousin announced her pregnancy. My stepmom raised her wine glass and said, loud enough for all 17 relatives to hear, well, at least some of us can carry on the family name properly. She looked directly at me. It's such a shame when someone can't contribute to the family legacy. Makes you wonder if they're really part of the family at all. My dad just stared at his plate. He'd married her three years ago after my mom died. That became her weapon. At every gathering, she'd mention it. Oh, we're talking about grandchildren. Well, some of us won't be providing any. My dad gave apologetic looks, but never said a word. Christmas, she announced she was pregnant at 39. She spent the evening rubbing her belly and talking about real blood family and continuing the pure family line. That's when I started digging. I found her ex husband on Facebook. We talked for three hours. She'd cleaned out their joint accounts while he visited his dying mother, filed a restraining order based on fabricated abuse claims, took the house. He'd lost everything, including custody of his daughter, because she Convinced the judge he was dangerous. He had evidence. Bank statements, text messages, affidavits from neighbors who'd witnessed her screaming at him. I kept digging. Three previous marriages, same pattern. Then I found her daughter, the one she'd given up at 19 and never mentioned. I found her through adoption registries. She was 20 now and had been searching for years. I verified everything three times. Then I planned. Family reunion was in July at my uncle's lakehouse. My stepmom spent weeks planning it, determined to show off her pregnancy. I R S V P ed for two. She was holding court by the pool, one hand on her belly, surrounded by relatives. My dad stood beside her. I walked up with my guest. The crowd parted. My stepmom's face went white. This is my sister, I announced loudly. Her daughter from her first pregnancy, the one she's never mentioned. Her daughter turned to our stepmom. I've been looking for you for three years. I just wanted to know why you gave me up. My stepmom stammered. That's not. I don't. You must be mistaken. I pulled out my folder and started passing around documents. Bank statements from her second marriage showing theft. Police reports from her third marriage proving her abuse allegations were dismissed. Text messages where she told her friend she was only in it for the money. And medical records showing she'd had her tubes tied four years ago. The pregnancy was a lie. The bump was Padding.

Stop being a bitter bitch just because you're still single. Then her and Marvin went away, mumbling about how I wasn't right in the head. After that confrontation, I kept my distance, focusing my lens on the reception. But during the father daughter dance, my viewfinder caught something that changed everything Marvin and the maid of honor kissing passionately behind the gazebo. I switched to my longer lens and spent 20 minutes documenting their affair. Having fun? I asked Marvin when he emerged disheveled. His face went white seeing my camera. Gemma doesn't need to know, he stammered. You're right, she doesn't need to. She deserves to, I replied. But instead of causing a scene, I kept filming. My camera had captured everything Gemma screaming at her grandmother for walking too slow, calling her mother a pathetic cow over flowers, vomiting on her dress while counting gift envelopes, slapping Marvin when he mentioned a female co worker. At night's end, Gemma extended her hand for the memory cards like I was surrendering stolen property. Here's the card with your formal portraits, I said sweetly, handing her one card while keeping four others. I knew you'd come through, she sneered. Though your work better be worth the food we wasted on you. I looked her straight in the eye. Everyone's going to see exactly what your wedding was worth. She was too drunk to understand, turning to tell her bridesmaids, the help is Finally leaving at 3 a m. From my apartment, I emailed everything. The unedited album titled Gemma's Wedding The Truth to every Guest, both families, her employer, her clients, and Marvin's Law firm. The time stamps for each photo. By 7:00am, my phone had exploded. Gemma called 10 times before I finally answered. What the f did you do? She screamed. I photographed your wedding, I said calmly, just like you asked. You vindictive bitch! You ruined everything! No, Gemma. You did that when you treated me like hired help after I gifted you $4,000 of work. Marvin grabbed the phone and take them down now, or I'll sue you. Sue me for what? Taking photos you asked me to take? For documenting your affair with a maid of honor? The line went dead. Gemma's mother called next, threatening legal action until I reminded her about the photos of her daughter calling her pathetic. The maid of honor's fiance called, thanking me for showing him the truth. Gemma showed up at my apartment at noon, pounding on my door, mascara streaming. I thought we were friends. So did I, I said through the door, friends don't humiliate friends in front of everyone. She sobbed. You're right, Gemma. You are absolutely right.

When I arrived, I discovered she told everyone I was the paid help and couldn't eat with guests. Gemma and I had been friends since college. When she asked me to photograph her wedding for free, I initially quoted my standard rate of $4,000, but she gasped and said, I thought we were best friends. Real friends don't charge each other. She then started crying about wedding stress and budget problems, promising I'd be her guest of honour, sitting at the head table celebrating as her best friend who just happened to a camera. Against my better judgment, I agreed to photograph her wedding. The morning of the wedding, when the catering manager tried directing me to the kitchen, I marched straight to Gemma in her bridal suite. What the hell is this about me eating in the kitchen? I demanded. She barely looked up from her phone, saying, well, you are working, aren't you? It would look weird if the photographer was eating with guests. I reminded her of our agreement and she rolled her eyes. God, don't be so dramatic. Just do this one thing for me on my day. I stormed out of the bridal suite, but Gemma's mother immediately intercepted me in the hallway, pressing a vendor meal ticket into my hand. The kitchen staff will call you when it's time to eat. I handed it back firmly. I'm Gemma's Best friend and a guest. There's been a misunderstanding. Her mother's face went hold. Gemma specifically told me, you're the hired help. Don't make a scene at my daughter's wedding. During the ceremony, as I photographed from the aisle, Gemma's cousin leaned over and asked loudly, are you the budget photographer Gemma found on Craigslist? Before Gemma could respond from the altar, I announced, actually, I'm the professional photographer doing this as a wedding gift that would normally cost four grand. Gemma's face flushed red and her smile froze. Between the ceremony and reception, while photographing the wedding party, I overheard Gemma telling her bridesmaids she charged her parents $3,000 for photography, pocketing the money since she got me to work for free. So what? She snapped when I confronted her. You can afford it with all your fancy clients. Her maid of honour laughed about Gemma selling today's prince workers for $75 each as exclusive professional photography. I'm watermarking everything with my business logo and rates, I declared. Gemma grabbed my arm hard enough to leave marks. You will not ruin this for me. At cocktail hour, Marvin the groom, cornered me. He was drunk and tried sliding his hand down my back. Gemma told me about your desperate financial situation, he said, trying to imply something disgusting. I snapped loudly, get your hands off me, Marvin, or I'll tell everyone about Vegas! Gemma saw

I responded, understood. Two days later, their lawyer reached out to me in a panic. I've been the family's financial backbone for nearly 4 years. I paid their 1,800 dollar monthly mortgage like clockwork, plus utilities, insurance, emergency repairs, everything. My name, my credit, my money. They never said thank you. My sister Marissa was always in crisis. Credit card maxed out. I paid it. Car repairs, I covered it. Daycare costs, I sent cash until she figured it out. Three years later, she was still figuring it out. I never said no because I thought this was what family did until I Learned it was exactly what they expected. The first crack appeared while scrolling Facebook. There was Marissa, my parents and the kids in front of the house I was paying for, holding a Home Sweet Home sign. The caption, so proud of our daughter for building a future we can all share. This home is in the right hands. No acknowledgement of me, no tag, no gratitude, just them smiling on a porch I had paid for. Days later, I called the bank. Mortgage was still in my name, but there was a request to change the primary contact to Miss Marissa Harper. Then I found $2,400 missing from my account, transferred to Marissa's emergency card. When confronted, she said, don't make this a thing, Jordan. We needed groceries. I assumed we were still sharing that card. My Mother's response, Marissa is going through a lot. Let's not fight over a few dollars. Few dollars for me. Disaster for Marissa when she missed a phone payment. The family group chat became worse. Someone posted a meme of a man handing over his wallet. Big Brother Energy, pay now, ask never. My cousin tag Jordan. Another, can you cover my student loans too, my father? Only if you name your child after him to keep the donor happy. Nobody defended me. But the final blow came while mowing their backyard. The kitchen window was open and I heard my mother and Marissa talking. Marissa laughed. Did you see his face when I told Aunt Karen the house was mine? He didn't even blink like a puppy, just happy to sniff the plate. Mom giggled. Once the paperwork goes through, he won't be able to say anything. Then Marissa delivered the killing blow. Mom, he's not family anymore. He's just a sponsor. I stood there letting those words sink in. Not family as a sponsor. Three weeks later came the invitation for my mother's 60th birthday, 60 guests, full catering, a legacy event. I didn't rsvp, I just prepared. I printed everything, $311,115 and 84 total contributions with dates and bank records. I saved the audio of their conversation and screenshots of the group chat mockery. I arrived 15 minutes late. During the speeches about sacrifice and love, this screen showed the house with built with love, passed down with Purpose, no mention of me. My mother took the microphone. I'm proud of Marissa. She's shown what legacy truly means. This home will stay in the right hands. I stood up and walked to the microphone. Since we're talking about legacy, let's do the.

We went to court, and I won. The judge looked at their claims, looked at my evidence, and dismissed the case in under 20 minutes. He even made a comment about wasting the court's time. I thought that nightmare was finally over. Then last week, John's sister found me on Instagram under a fake account. She sent me a long message saying she just got engaged, but her boyfriend can't afford a ring. She said since I'm not engaged anymore, I should give her John's ring so it can actually be used for a wedding instead of sitting in my jewelry box. When I said no, she lost it. She started messaging me from different numbers, different social media accounts, even had her friends contact me, saying I was selfish and heartless. My phone was on the table during lunch with my friend Sarah when another message popped up. Sarah read it and asked what was going on. I explained everything, and she got quiet. Then she said maybe I should just give the ring to his sister, that it would mean more to someone who's actually getting married. She told our other friends, and now they're all saying the same thing. That I'm being petty, that I should move on and let the family have the ring. I started doubting myself. Maybe they were Right. Maybe I was holding onto something I didn't need anymore. But then yesterday, I found out the truth. One of John's co workers reached out to me. He said he'd heard about the court case and wanted me to know something. John had life insurance through his job policy. Worth $40,000. It went directly to his parents. The funeral cost 18,000. I did some digging. John's parents own a property management company. They have rental houses all over town. His dad drives a BMW. They're not rich, but they're definitely not broke. They were never struggling to pay for the funeral. They lied to me while I was grieving. Took my money, and then tried to take the one thing I had left of John. And now I know why. They really wanted the ring back. They were planning to sell it.

John died three months after proposing. We were supposed to get married in August. Instead, I planned his funeral in March. His parents called me two days after the accident, crying, saying they couldn't afford a proper service. I didn't even think twice. I emptied our wedding account, the one we've been building together for two years. Every penny we'd save for the venue, the catering, the photographer, all of it went to giving John the funeral he deserved. The morning after we buried him, I was still in the black dress from the service when his brother knocked on my door. He didn't ask how I was doing. He just said he needed the ring back. I was confused. I asked him why, and he looked me straight in the eye and said the ring had been in their family for five generations. Pass down from their great, great, great grandparents. He said it belonged to the family, not to me. I told him that was impossible. I was there when John bought it. We went to this jewelry store that makes some pieces inspired by fantasy movies. John picked out the design, paid for it with his credit card, and proposed that same night. The ring was two sizes too big, so we went back the next week and exchanged it for the right size. I still had the receipt. With both transactions, John's signature, everything. His brother's face turned red. He called me a liar and said I must have faked the paperwork. Then he stormed out. Within an hour, my phone wouldn't stop buzzing. John's mom, his dad, add his sister, his aunts. All of them calling and texting, saying I stole a family heirloom. They said I was dishonoring John's memory by keeping something that wasn't mine. I blocked most of them, but. And I got a letter from a lawyer. They were suing me for the ring, and they were demanding I reimburse them for the funeral costs. Because apparently, I had no right to plan it without their permission. I couldn't believe it. I paid for everything. The casket, the flowers, the burial plot, all of it. And now they wanted me to pay them back. I hired a lawyer and showed him everything. The receipt from the jewelry store with the date and John's name. The exchange paperwork showing we swapped sizes, photos I'd taken.

So I ghosted him, filed for divorce, and moved to a different city to protect my babies. I'm 28, married to Mike for six years. He was kind when we met, helped me escape my drug addicted parents. The only problem was his family. Mike came from extreme wealth. His mother and sister Kayla were cruel from day one. At our first dinner, his mother scoffed, if someone like you would know anything about art. His sister showed Mike bikini photos of his ex right in front of me, telling him he could slide into her DMs anytime. For years, they called me a gold digger, mocked my appearance, and made fun of my poor background. When Mike stopped talking to Kayla after she ruined my birthday, she sent me death threats via text. I eventually stopped attending family events all together. Despite his family, Mike proposed last year. His sister demanded he get a prenup because poor people like you suck money out of anyone. I offered to sign one anyway. I wasn't marrying him for money. Three months ago, I found out I was pregnant with twins. Mike insisted on announcing it at a family gathering. When we did, everyone congratulated us except Kayla and my mother in law, who stared daggers at me. Kayla had been trying to get pregnant for years. But was infertile. Mike's family tried convincing her to adopt, but she refused, saying she didn't want to raise a kid from the streets. When Mike's relatives asked about baby showers, Kayla burst out crying and locked herself in the bathroom. After 30 minutes, she came out and told me I should have talked to her first. My mother in law said I was selfish and made everything about me. Suddenly, Kayla became unusually kind. Both she and my mother in law started calling regularly, sending flowers with cards saying can't wait to see the twins. Kayla even offered to throw my baby shower, which she organized perfectly. The day of the shower, I excused myself to use the bathroom. Coming out, I heard my husband and mother in law arguing in hushed tones in the hallway. My mother in law asked Mike if he'd talked to me yet about their plan with the twins. Mike told her to lower her voice, but she said he needed to man up. Then she said it clearly. He needed to discuss this before the twins were born. Otherwise they wouldn't be able to give one of the twins to Kayla on time for her 27th birthday. She reminded him he'd already agreed, and she's been looking forward to getting a child for months now. They were planning to give away one of my babies as a birthday gift. I stood frozen as they discussed it like it was normal. Mike kept saying He was working on it, and it wasn't an easy conversation. I waited for them to finish.

I did. Days later, her father stormed into her house screaming, do you know what he just did? She didn't even look up from her phone when she said it. Just a casual go ahead, move out, like she was giving me permission to grab coffee. I could see her new guy's name lighting up her screen every few seconds. Sean. Of course, his name was Sean. You've been miserable here anyway, she added, still scrolling. We both know this hasn't been working. I didn't argue, didn't beg, just walked to the bedroom and started packing. Same duffle bag I'd used when I moved in seven years ago, back when her family actually pretended to respect me. She got louder as I folded shirts, talking to herself but making sure I could hear. You'll land on your feet or maybe not. That little laugh at the end, the one that cuts deep better than any insult. When I zip a bag and walked back through the kit Cooper, she looked up with mock surprise. You're actually going, you told me to. My voice was flat. I let the door closed behind me without looking back. What she forgot, what her whole entitled family forgot was that their boutique hotel, the 20 room property her father loves bragging about runs entirely on a booking system I built from scratch six years ago. Not just any system, custom platform I spent eight months developing Handling everything from reservations to inventory to automated guest communications. It's sophisticated, proprietary and licensed under my software company's name. When we were happy, I gave them a sweetheart deal, $500 a month for software that would cost them 15 grand anywhere else. Over six years, I'd save them over $1 million. They'd grown comfortable. Father strutted around town talking about our family business like he'd built it all himself, forgetting the tech guy who made it actually function. I gave it three days. Then I sent the email. Professional, courteous, completely airtight, 30 days notice to turn, terminate the licensing agreement. They could migrate to a new system or pay market rate, $12,000 per month plus a $50,000 setup fee. Their family lawyer called within an hour, voice tight with panic. You can't just pull the software. We have contracts. Check section 7, sub section 3, I said calmly. Either party may.

For my entire childhood, my family had this group chat. Mom, dad, my older brother Tyler, and my younger sister Mia. Everyone except me. I found out when I was 16. I walked into the kitchen, and they were all laughing about something. When I asked what was funny, they got quiet. Tyler slipped and said it was just something in the chat. What chat? My mom tried to play it off, oh, just a silly family thing. You know how it is. But I didn't know because I wasn't in it. I thought maybe it was a mistake, so I asked my dad to add me later. He said, sure, honey, but he never did. Then I started noticing things. They'd all go to dinner on random Tuesdays, take weekend trips I only heard about after my sister got concert tickets from the family chat. My brother knew about my cousin's wedding three months before I did. Every single time I asked to be included, they'd say, oh, yeah, we'll add you, and then just wouldn't. I tried bringing it up seriously. Once sat my mom down and said, it really hurts that I'm not in the family chat. She laughed. Actually laughed. Sweetheart, you're so sensitive. It's just a group chat. Just a group chat where they planned literally everything without me. My dad said I was making a big Deal out of nothing. Tyler told me to stop being weird about it. Mia said you wouldn't even use it anyway. But how would they know? They never gave me the chance. Last year, my brother got engaged. I found out three weeks later when I saw the photos on Facebook. Three weeks? It all known the night it happened because he announced it in the chat. When I confronted him, he said, I figured someone told you. Nobody did, because nobody thought about me. Then came my mom's birthday last month. I showed up at her house with flowers and a gift I'd spent two hours picking out. When I walked in, they were all dressed up, grabbing their coats. Oh, my mom said, looking genuinely surprised to see me. We're just heading out to dinner. What dinner? She glanced at my dad. The reservation for my birthday. Nobody told me about a reservation. Tyler jumped in. We thought you were busy. I wasn't busy. I was never busy. They just didn't tell me. My sister said it was in the chat. Like that explained everything. I stood there holding flowers in a gift bag, watching my entire family awkwardly shuffle toward the door. My mom gave me this pitying smile. We can do something next week, just the two of us. I left the flowers on the counter and walked out. That's when I decided I was done asking. Christmas came around and I didn't reach out. Didn't Ask about plans. Didn't text to confirm anything. Just waited. Two days before Christmas. My sister texted you coming to mom and Dad's on the 25th? I said I wasn't invited. She sent me a screenshot from the group chat. The one I'm still not in. Where they've been planning for weeks. Menu, who is bringing what, what time to arrive. Everything. I stared at that screenshot for a long time. Then I replied, let me know when there's a chat I'm actually part of. She tried calling. I decline.

He just looked at her and said, ma'am, you might want to call your lawyer. I'm standing on what used to be our porch when Vanessa opens the door with this twisted smile plastered across her face. The kind of smile that says she's been planning this moment. She announces, already pulling out her phone to dial 9 1 1. I warned you to stay away from my property. Your property? I ask, keeping my voice calm. Vanessa, I just came to get my tools from the garage. We agreed. We agreed to nothing. She cuts me off, her finger hovering over the call button. You're trespassing, and now you're going to jail. I'd moved out three weeks ago after our breakup got nasty. I've been staying at my parents place, trying to figure out the next steps. The house, the one I bought two years before we even met, was supposed to be sorted out through lawyers. Vanessa had been stalling, refusing to move out, claiming she had tenant rights. Today, I'd simply come to collect my power tools from the garage. I texted her that morning to let her know. She'd responded with, fine, whatever. But apparently she'd had other plans. She presses the button. I can hear The dispatcher's voice through the speaker 911, what's your emergency? Yes, my ex boyfriend just broke into my house, Vanessa says, her voice suddenly shaking, theatrical. I'm terrified. Please send someone quickly. He's very aggressive. I just stand there, hands in my pockets, waiting. Because here's what Vanessa doesn't know. I'm not worried. Not even a little bit. The cop car pulls up within six minutes. Fast response time. The door opens and an officer steps out, adjusting his belt. When he turns toward us, I see the exact moment Vanessa's smirk reaches its safe peek. She thinks she's won. What she doesn't know is that Officer Bradley isn't just any cop. He's my younger brother. Bradley walks up the driveway, his face completely neutral, professional. He glances at me with zero recognition. We talked about this exact scenario last week when Vanessa had threatened to make my life hell. Then turns his attention to her. Ma'am, what seems to be the problem here? Vanessa straightens up, playing the victim perfectly. Officer, thank god you're here. This man, she points at me dramatically, broke into my house. I want him arrested. Bradley pulls out his notepad, clicking his pen. Your house, you said? Yes, my house, she repeats, more confident now. And you own this property? I live here. Vanessa snaps, irritation creeping into her voice. We lived here together. Now it's mine. Ma'am, that's not what I asked. Bradley says, his tone still perfectly calm, do you own this Property? Is your name on the deed? It's my home. Bradley looks down at his notepad, then back at her. This house is registered solely to. He pauses, glancing at me. To this gentleman

You were supposed to do all the work for the group. It was agreed. Julie screamed at me in front of our history class, a blank slideshow with only our names was shown on the giant screen. Did you want us to fail? Julie hissed. You told me you had it. I say you did this on purpose. Julie stuttered. She kept flipping through blank note cards of our group project. The realization setting in that I didn't complete the group project like she wanted. Mr Cooper, Julie whined. He didn't do anything. She pointed a finger at me. You are a total loser. Mr Cooper had us sit back down. The entire class was laughing at Julie's red face. On Monday, my history teacher, Mr Cooper, had announced that on Friday we'd be presenting a history project. It was a slideshow and speech on World War 2. Mister Cooper gave us the guidelines and requirements and put us into groups of five. After class that afternoon, my group headed into the school library. Julie was the leader of the popular kids and thought she was the queen bee. Now I'm going to do the speaking because like I'm totally the best, Julie insisted before I even sat down. But like, totally. You're gonna actually do all the work, Julie demanded. I rolled my eyes, but I got to work anyway. I wasn't gonna let them ruin my grades. Christie I'm trusting you with the fashion. We can't look like total rejects. I don't think it matters what we look like. It's about our work, I said, and received an eye roll in return. I just wanted to get the project done. We have to work, Cameron asked, laughing, totally confused, throwing his football around. So did anyone see how awesome I was at the game last night? Cameron continued. Oh, Cameron, you were so sexy. Christie flirted. We should like totally go to my house. They started to talk and chat like it was lunch, period. Anytime I tried to speak, they got louder. So I tried to work on my part of the project. On Wednesday, I arrived at Christie's house and I could hear the music blasting. It looked like half the school had shown up. Cameron had the entire football team there. Kids were doing the devil's grass. Christie had hired a DJ. Julie was even drinking out of the red solo cups. Guys, I totally found the good stuff, Christie said, drunk out of her mind and holding two bottles of vodka. We we need to do our project. I had to shout over the music. We don't need your help, nerd. If you're so worried about it, finish it yourself. Leave, Julie snorted, pointing to the door. So I did. When I got home, I sent the project off to Julie's email, but there was nothing done. I even deleted my own work. If They didn't want my help. Fine, let I'm cook. Thursday at school, Julie grinned at me. Thanks for finishing the project. I guess you were useful after all. I just smiled and nodded. You're welcome. Anything for the group. I knew I had to talk to Mr Cooper. Cut to this morning. I had gotten to school early and went to his class. Mr Cooper, I need to explain something. I'm a little panicked. What if he didn't believe me? Luckily, he did. I showed him the entire slideshow.

He was running out the clock while improving what he thought would become his property. Then on day 27, a massive hotel style soaking tub showed up for the master bathroom with jets and built in mood lighting. The installation took six hours and two plumbers to connect everything, and the tub alone was $8,000. When they finished, Liam texted me a photo of himself in the tub holding a glass of wine with the caption living my best life. I forwarded it to my lawyer and told her we were moving. Day 29, I showed up with my grandmother. Liam answered the door in a bathrobe like he owned the place, and barely acknowledged us before heading back to make coffee on his new espresso machine. I walked my grandmother through every room, pointing out the upgrades with exaggerated excitement. She played along perfectly. Liam, this hot tub is incredible. And this new bedroom. You did all of this? He looked confused, but nodded slowly. I let her into the master bathroom and gestured at the massive tub. And this is the crown jewel. Liam spent weeks picking out every detail to thank me for letting him stay here during his hard time. My grandmother hugged him. That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard. Not many young people understand gratitude anymore. Liam opened his mouth, but I kept talking. I've been wanting to redo This kitchen for years, but never had time. Having you surprise me with all this as a gift is just incredible. His face went pale. Now that the project's done, you can head home and get back to your life. It's been almost 30 days. I handed him an envelope. This is your notice to vacate. You've got four hours. He ripped it open and his face turned red. You can't do this. I put over $75,000 into this place. I smiled. Into my place as a gift. Like I just told grandma, gifts don't come with conditions. He looked at my grandmother for support. I never said it was a gift. This is my house now. I've been living here. My grandmother's face fell. Liam, you just let him think you did all this out of kindness? That's very disappointing. Liam turned back to me, desperate. You knew what I was doing. You watched me do it. I shrugged. I watched you give me the most generous gift anyone's ever given me. Thank you so much for my new kitchen and bathroom. Liam tried to protest, but my grandmother was already walking toward the deck to try out the hot tub. He looked at me one last time, saw nothing but a smile, and left without packing. I called out thank you to my grandmother and turned to take a long bubble bath in my brand new soaking tub.

My cousin Liam called me three months ago asking to use my Delaware beach house for a weekend. He just gone through another breakup and needed somewhere quiet to think. I said sure because the place it's empty most weekends anyway, and he promised he'd be gone by Monday. When I handed him the keys, he grabbed me in a hug and said, you have no idea how much this means to me right now. I told him to enjoy the ocean and left it at that. Monday came and went without a word. I texted Tuesday morning asking if he was okay and he said the extended stay was doing wonders for his mental health and he'd be out by Friday. Friday became next Monday, then the following week, then excuses about car trouble and waiting for parts. Two weeks after I handed Liam the keys, my neighbour sent a photo of construction trucks in my driveway. I drove down immediately and walked into my house to find workers ripping out my kitchen cabinets while Liam stood there pointing at granite samples like he was choosing tile for his own renovation show. I stared at the gutted kitchen and asked what he thought he was doing. He didn't even look up from the countertop brochure in his hand. This kitchen is ancient and the layout makes no Sense I'm doing you a favor by fixing it while I'm here. You should be thanking me. I asked how he planned to pay for this and he waved me off. I've got it covered. You worry too much. Besides, it's not like you were using this place anyway. The contractor showed me the work order with Liam's name on it, requesting a full remodel with custom cabinets, stone countertops and new appliances. $28,000. I looked at Liam scrolling through his phone like this was all perfectly normal and something clicked. I told. I told the contractor everything looked great and to keep going. Then I walked out without another word. Over the next two weeks I watched my beach house transform into something I didn't recognise. A 15 thousand dollar hot tub appeared on the deck with crews running electrical lines and reinforcing the structure for three straight days. My neighbour kept me updated on the noise and the constant parade of trucks and I told her it would be over soon. All my furniture disappeared and got replaced with a 12 thousand dollar leather sectional, matching chairs and a glass dining table that probably cost more than both. A construction crew framed out a whole new bedroom addition off the back of the house with Florida ceiling windows facing the water and the permits and construction ran him another 14,000. I checked the county permits and found Liam had filed everything under his name as the property owner. Forging paperwork that said he had authority to make structural changes. I also checked tenant laws and realized what he was doing. After 30 days of continuous residence, he legal

I was in the bathroom during lunch when I heard two girls talking outside. Did you see Lena's test? Another hundred. Obviously she goes to Caldwell's tutoring. I sat there frozen because I just got my test back that morning. 54. I'd studied for hours and knew every answer. I rushed back to class and grabbed my test from my bag. Then I looked at Lena's desk. Her test was sitting there with 100 circled in green pen. We'd studied together the night before. I'd helped her understand half the material. During class, I glanced at her answers. They looked almost identical to mine. But mine was covered in red marks. After class, I caught up to her. My heart was pounding. Lena, how did you get 100? Our answers were the same. She wouldn't look at me. I go to Mister Caldwell's tutoring. You should try it. Then she walked away fast. That night, I laid my last three tests out. 58, 61, 54. Each one worse. Even though I studied harder. I needed to figure out what was happening. The next week, I went to Caldwell's classroom after school. I felt nauseous the entire walk there. Mister Caldwell, I need help understanding why I keep failing. He barely looked up. You're not putting in the effort. My chest got tight. But I study constantly. I know this material. He stared at me like I was the dumbest person he'd Ever seen? Then maybe history isn't your strong suit. You should consider switching to regular history. I felt my face getting hot. My answers are the same as students who are passing. His voice went ice cold. Are you accusing me of something? My mouth went dry. No, I just don't understand the grading. He waved his hand at me. Then figure it out yourself. I have work to do. I left feeling worthless. Next test came back worse. 49. I cried in the bathroom during lunch. Before turning that test in, I'd taken a photo of my answers. When I compared it to my graded test, I felt sick. Half my correct answers were marked wrong. Meanwhile, Lena showed me her test. Another hundred. One of her essay answers was three sentences that barely made sense. I showed her my photo, which was a full paragraph with dates and analysis. She glanced at it, then looked down. I don't want to talk about this. Her voice was quiet and scared. Over the next month, I noticed the pattern. Girls were getting top scores while guys were failing. I started sitting with three other guys from class. At lunch, we laid out our tests. All of us were failing despite knowing the material. All of us had jobs or sports after school. One of them said he'd asked Caldwell for help and got told to stop wasting his time. We started keeping track. 8 girls getting straight hundreds. 12 of Us failing everything. Then one of the guys said something that made my skin crawl. All those girls go to Caldwell after school, tutoring. Every single one of them. I went to my guidance counselor with this Pat. She looked at me like I was being dramatic. Mr. Caldwell has been here 15 years. If you're failing, maybe you need to take responsibility. Nobody would listen. Caldwell acted like I didn't exist. My grade dropped to a 46. I was going to fail this class, and nobody cared. In January, I can't take it anymore. I walk to the principal's office with the photos, the pattern and the proof. The three other guys are right behind me. We're done being quiet. The principal listens without interrupt

I raised my hand as a joke. I helped my mom watch YouTube videos when she was pregnant with my brother. Does that count? The class laughed and I smiled, proud of my quick thinking. But Mister Gonzales wasn't smiling. His face had gone completely white and his hands were shaking as he gripped the edge of his desk. Good. Come with me now. The entire classroom went silent in South Dallas when a teacher used that tone. You didn't ask questions. Everyone stay in your seats. Do not leave this room. If I'm not back in 20 minutes, have someone call 9, 1 1. He was already pulling me toward the door and that's when I noticed the dark stain on his sleeve. Wet. It looked like blood. Mr Gonzales, what's happening? Is someone hurt? I tried to pull my arm free, but his grip was iron tight. I don't think I'm qualified for whatever. You're the only one who raised their hand. He cut me off. That makes you qualified. Outside, his car was already running with the doors open. She said she had until Thursday. He kept muttering while speeding out of the school parking lot. The midwife isn't answering her phone I the door handle, calculating if I could jump out at the next red light. Mr Gonzales, you're scaring me. Should I call my mom? No. He swerved around. A car and I slammed into the window. No one can know. Put your phone away. Turn it off. I'm not turning off my phone, I shouted. But I did anyway. We were going 50 in a 25 zone and Mr Gonzales kept checking his mirrors like someone was following us. Finally, he pulled into a driveway of a small yellow house that definitely wasn't his. Listen to me. He grabbed my shoulders before we got out. They can't know she was here. Do you understand? No matter what happens, they can't know. I don't understand anything. I was practically yelling, now I'm 17. I don't even have my license yet. Marco. He used my name for the first time, his voice desperate. You've kept bigger secrets than this. I know your family. I need that same silence now. He wasn't wrong. I'd already seen two drive bys this year and never said a word to the cops. But this felt different. He shoved a pair of surgical gloves into my hands. Put these on. The front door was unlocked. Inside, we followed the sound of crying to a back bedroom where a woman was curled up on a bare mattress. She looked young, maybe early 20s, with long black hair stuck to her face with sweat. It's too early, she gasped in accented English when she saw us. Then she looked at me and started crying harder. He's just a child. You brought a child. I'm 17, I said. Stupid like that made any difference? I watch Grey's anatomy, if that helps. She switched to Spanish and started begging Mister Gonzales for something I couldn't understand. He pushed me toward her. Check how dilated she is. What? I backed up so fast I knocked over.

I was devastated but also angry. We were supposed to travel to Europe next summer. She promised we'd finally do that sister trip we talked about for years. At her funeral, so many people I didn't know came up to me saying how much she talked about me, her brilliant little sister who was going places. It felt like they were talking about someone else's sister. Dad handed me her personal effects in a small box. Her phone was still working. I scrolled through her calendar and saw dozens of reminders about my life, my exam dates, my work presentation, even my dentist appointment next month. She had an alert set for my favorite band's new album release. I sat in my car for an hour just staring at these digital bread crumbs of her love. While cleaning out her apartment, I found this worn leather journal. Inside was her neat handwriting dated 16 years ago. The first entry was from when I was 7. Mom's not doing well. The doctor say she has weeks. She made me promise to look after sis. I'm only fifteen, but I swore I would. I never knew our mom was sick. Dad always told me she died suddenly from a heart condition. I kept reading. Every page detailed how my sister rearranged her entire life to keep her promise. She turned down her dream college because it Was too far from home. She worked nights so she could walk me to school in the mornings. She scheduled her classes around my activities so I'd never be alone. There was an entry from the night of that concert. She's so mad at me for showing up, but there were older guys hanging around. I'd rather have her angry than hurt. And about Ryan found out he got arrested for dealing. Can't tell her how I know. Dad's police friend tipped me off. She'll understand someday. The last entry was from the week before she died. Sometimes I wonder if she resents how much I'm in her business. But I promised mom I'd keep her safe. Maybe someday she'll understand it wasn't control, it was love.

I always thought my older sister was overprotective. Growing up, she'd walk me to school, even though her high school was in the opposite direction. She'd check my homework, pack my lunches, and always asked who I was hanging out with. It drove me crazy. When I was 13, I wanted to go to my first concert with friends. No parents, just us. She insisted on coming along, sitting rose behind us like some kind of shadow. I remember the burning embarrassment when my friend spotted her. I didn't speak to her for days afterward. In high school, she somehow always knew when I was hanging out with Ryan, this guy she thought was trouble. She'd conveniently need to pick me up early or would show up with some urgent reason. One night, she literally pulled me out of a party where there was drinking. I screamed at her in the car that she was ruining my life. She just gripped the steering wheel tighter and said, hate me now if you need to. When I moved away for college, she'd call every Sunday without fail. She'd ask about my classes, if I was eating right, did I need money for books. I'd rush through these calls, annoyed at her constant hovering. Sometimes I'd accidentally miss her calls, texting later with flimsy excuses. For my 21st birthday, she surprised me by flying cross country. I had plans with friends. That weekend. But she'd already booked us tickets to this play I'd mentioned once months before. I reluctantly canceled my parties. She seemed so happy during that weekend that I couldn't bring myself to tell her how much her visit had disrupted my life. Last year she planned this huge family reunion for our parents anniversary. I complained the whole time about taking time off work. She just smiled and said, family is everything, kiddo. During that weekend, she pulled me aside and made me promise to come home for Christmas. No excuses this time, she said, hugging me tighter than usual. I promised half heartedly.

But I wanted to do more than just get him kicked off. I started documenting everything. I took screenshots of him changing my playlists, recorded videos of songs suddenly switching while I was using the app, and even got my friend to witness him controlling my music from across the classroom. Then I found out something interesting. Ben had been bragging to other people about hacking not just my account, but several other students accounts too. He thought it was hilarious that he could mess with people's music and make them look stupid. So I reached out to those other kids and found out they had the same experience. Random music playing at inappropriate times, embarrassing songs showing up in their recent activity playlists, getting messed with. Some of them had even gotten in trouble with their parents when explicit songs started playing through their home speakers. We all decided to report this together. But instead of just going to Spotify, we went to the school administration first. Turns out what Ben was doing counts as cyberbullying and harassment. And our school has a zero tolerance policy for that kind of stuff. The school called his parents and mine for a meeting. When they showed all the evidence we had collected, Ben's face went completely white. His parents were furious because they had no idea their son was using his computer skills to torment other students. But here's where it gets Really good. The school decided to involve the police because technically what Ben did was unauthorized access to other people's accounts, which is actually illegal. They called it computer fraud and abuse. Ben started crying and begging everyone not to press charges. He promised he would stop and even offered to help us secure our accounts better. But it was too late. The damage was done and we were all fed up with his behavior. The police officer explained that even though we were all minors, this kind of digital harassment was taken seriously. Ben ended up getting charged with multiple counts of unauthorized computer access and cyberbullying. His parents had to hire a lawyer and pay thousands of dollars in legal fees. He got suspended from school for two weeks and had to do community service. The court also ordered him to stay away from all of us and prohibited him from using any social media or streaming services for six months.

So there's this kid at school named Ben who thinks he's some kind of tech genius. He's always bragging about how he can hack into anything and showing off with his fancy coding skills. Most people just ignore him, but he made the mistake of targeting me last month. I was sitting in the library working on an essay when Ben comes over and starts looking at my laptop screen. I had Spotify open in another tab because I was listening to music while I worked. Starts laughing and says my playlist is trash and asks if he can show me some real music. I said no thanks and went back to my work, but Ben doesn't take no for an answer. He pulls out his phone and starts typing away and suddenly my Spotify starts skipping songs. Then it switches to some death metal band I've never heard of. I look at him and he's got this smug grin on his face, whispers that he's connected to my account and can control it from his phone. Then he starts blasting the volume up and down just to mess with me. The librarian comes over and tells me to keep it down, which was embarrassing because everyone was staring. I told Ben to stop, but he just kept going. He changed my playlist name to something stupid and started adding weird songs to it. When I tried to change it back on my laptop, he Would just override it from his phone. It was like playing tug of war with my own account. The worst part was when he started following random people on my account and liking their playlists. Some of them were really inappropriate ones with explicit names. I was mortified because all my friends could see this stuff in their activity feed. After about 20 minutes of this torture, I finally had enough. I grabbed my stuff and left the library. But even at home he was still messing with my account. Songs would randomly start playing in the middle of the night or my playlists would get deleted and recreated with terrible music. This went on for three days. Ben would walk past me in the hallway and smirk, knowing he had complete control over my Spotify. He even changed my profile picture to some meme of a crying baby. I tried changing my password, but somehow he still had access. That's when I came up with my plan. I did some research and found out that Spotify has a feature with

My 10 year old son came home confused because his history teacher told the class that the Great Wall of China is visible from space with the naked eye. My son Alex has always been fascinated by space. Since he was five, we've spent countless nights stargazing with our telescope. He knows all the planets and can recite facts about the International Space Station. Last year, I bought him a book signed by Chris Hadfield, the famous astronaut. Alex treasures it and can quote entire passages about what earth actually looks like from space. But everything changed when Mr Peterson started teaching history during a lesson about ancient wonders, told the class that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space with the naked eye. Alex raised his hand and explained that astronauts have confirmed this isn't true. The wall is too narrow and blends with the landscape. He mentioned that Hadfield's typically addressed this myth in his book. Mister Peterson cut him off. That's nonsense, he said. It's in our textbook and I've been teaching this fact for 20 years. Your little astronaut book is wrong. The next day, Alex brought in his signed book to show the passage. Instead of listening, Mister Peterson confiscated it, calling it disruptive material. He made Alex stand in front of the class and recite the Great Wall of China is visible from space. 10 times. When Alex came home, he was devastated. His precious signed book was gone and he felt humiliated. Mister Peterson had assigned a 5 page essay on the importance of respecting teacher's knowledge as punishment. I was furious. I emailed Mister Peterson explaining the facts and asking for the book back. His response, I don't need space facts from a parent. The curriculum says the wall is visible from space. That's what I teach. The principal seemed reluctant to contradict a 10 year teacher over what she called a minor factual dispute. That's when I decided to take action. My college roommate now work.

Then came the night of the storm. Lightning killed the power and we ended up in the garage trying to fix the breaker. I started talking about my dad, about the dumb jokes he told, how he once bought a Hawaiian shirt for a business casual event just to annoy my mom. Caleb laughed, an actual genuine laugh, and he got really quiet. I used to see him, he said, at school when he picked you up. I always knew who he was. I asked what he meant by that. He said, my mom told me not to talk to him ever, said it would mess everything up. He just glared at me until I told him I had no idea what he was talking about. He got really confused and said something that shocked me to my core. He said, your dad? He was my brother. I just stood there frozen. Explained how my grandfather paid his mom off to never say anything and never told his wife or my dad that he existed. But his mom told him when he was young about the entire situation. She admitted she was really hard on him. She constantly insisted that the name, the house, the family, it should belong to him, not me. I felt the floor tilt beneath me. I said, you bullied me because you were jealous. He flinched and said, no, yes, I don't know. I hated you because you had Everything. I wasn't allowed to want a dad who loved you, a real home. I wanted a brother, but I wasn't allowed to be with the one I had. We sat in silence once, not out of avoidance, but grief muted and shared. Later that week, I pulled out an old photo album, showed him pictures of my dad in a Santa suit falling off the roof because he thought it'd be funny to land on the sleigh. Caleb laughed until he choked. I told him that he and my dad had the same laugh. The tension between us didn't disappear, but it shifted into something else. Not friendship, not yet, but maybe family.

Now I know why I didn't cry at my grandfather's funeral. Not because I wasn't sad, I was just numb. My parents died 3 years ago in a car crash I'm still pretending didn't ruin me. Grandfather was the last thread connecting me to anything that felt like home. when the lawyer handed me the will and said I'd inherited the estate, I didn't feel joy, just more weight. But there was a catch. Of course there was. The lawyer said to claim full ownership, you'll need to live on the property for one year with another party also named in the will. And that other party turned out to be Caleb, the same Caleb who used to shove my face into my mashed potatoes in the cafeteria for an hour in 8th grade. Childhood bully. I laughed at the lawyer and said, this has to be a joke. That's when he walked in wearing a weathered leather jacket with his arms crossed and a face like he'd rather be anywhere else. Caleb said, trust me, if it is, I'm not laughing either. Neither of us wanted to spend our time together, but free housing in this economy was no joke. So we both signed and moved in. We avoided each other like a mouse would avoid a cat, only neither of us knew who the cat was. The house was massive enough that We barely crossed paths until the peanut thing. I was eating trail mix in the kitchen when he walked in, froze and said, you trying to kill me? I blinked and said, you allergic? He said, all it would take was one whiff and it's Epipen and ambulance time. I told him that my dad had the same allergy. Caleb's eyes flicked to mine and something passed there, something like recognition, guilt. It was gone before I could catch it. The days dragged into weeks. We didn't speak much, but the silence began to change. It softened. I caught him fixing the broken gutter one morning without being asked. Then I started leaving coffee on the counter for him as he rushed to work each morning.

She cried every day, sitting before an old bucket in despair. The family was so poor, the children had no pants to wear, using wooden barrels to cover their bodies as clothes. Inside the house, the walls were bare. Everything lay in ruins. Even the fish in the tank was so starved, only bones remained. When the woman opened the cupboard, there was just one plate and a single red bean, the only food for more than 20 people. Just then, dark clouds gathered overhead. The children rushed to the dining table, ready to eat. The woman was about to drop the red bean into the pot to cook and share among them, when one child stopped her, said he wanted to plant it instead. He carried the red bean into the yard, dug a hole with a shovel, buried it, covered it with soil and watered it. Soon the ground began to swell. A red bean vine sprouted, growing taller and taller, reaching high above the clouds. The boy grabbed the vine, said goodbye to his mother, and climbed upward until he reached the sky. In the distance, he saw a giant weighing over 500 pounds. The boy hid in the clouds, watching as the giant bathed, using the clouds like a shower. After bathing, the giant returned to his palace. He pulled a spring with all his might, and an iron ball shot out like A bowling ball lamps in the house lit up as it rolled into a hole, unlocking the gate to the sky castle. Once the giant entered, the boy followed the iron ball's path and slipped inside. In the palace, the giant walked slowly toward the golden egg production room. He grabbed the hen by the neck, looked under her, but found no egg. After a few slaps, the hen explained she was on her period and couldn't lay. The giant pulled her wings. Six cherries appeared in the hen's eyes, and a pile of giant golden eggs rolled out. The giant placed them under a cutting machine. Each golden egg was sliced into fragments, then stored inside a safe. After the giant left, the boy jumped down from the window, signaled the hen to stay quiet, picked her up, and prepared to escape. The giant heard the doorbell, dropped the safe, and chased after the chicken thief. In the end, the giant caught the boy, but the hen pulled out a large hammer and struck the giant hard on the head. Seizing the chance, the boy escaped with the hen. The giant chased them out of the palace. The hen hit him again with the hammer, knocking him down. The boy slid quickly down the vine back to the ground, the giant still in pursuit. Once on the ground, the boy in the hen grabbed an axe and chopped the vine. The giant fell crashing into the earth with a Huge impact leaving a massive crater and died instantly. Boy hugged the hen and returned to his mother. Then the hen laid a giant golden egg. The mother was overjoyed. They traded their worn out shoe house for a crystal shoe house and all the children rushed into their new home.

In an instant, it grew several times larger, bursting straight through the roof. After that, the hen took the Dinosaur outside and taught him to hunt for insects. The Dinosaur mimicked her movements, digging eagerly for food, but mistook tree roots for bugs and swallowed an entire tree in one gulp.

The more the Dinosaur ate, the bigger he grew, until he finally broke the farmhouse completely. The farmer stared in disbelief, then quickly called for help to take the young Dinosaur away. Left alone, the Han guarded the damaged coup, breathing and waiting at the Dinosaur Circus. Crowds came from all around, but the Dinosaur's heart remained with his mother. He began a hunger strike in protest. The circus staff thought he was sick and called a doctor, who diagnosed him with a serious illness and gave him little time left. When the Han saw the news in the paper, she rushed to the circus at once. She called out to her young one again and again, but got no response.

In the end, they performed together under the big top and spent the rest of their lives side by side, never to part again.

As the hook swayed in the water, a big fish soon appeared. Donald swiftly speared it with a fork. Meanwhile, the little ant was still dangling from the hook. It asked Donald to lower it again, so he repeated the trick and sure enough, caught another big fish. Even more absurdly, a whole school of fish began leaping up, trying to bite the hook. Luckily, the little ant noticed in time, or it would have been swallowed alive. Just as the ant was about to escape, it froze at what it saw, a whole pile of fish lying before it. That's when it realized Donald had been using it all along, though anger filled its heart. Faced with Donald's sincere apology, the little ant forgave him. Soon, the two enjoyed a meal together, eating all the fish they'd caught. Just then, Donald, who'd taken a nap, suddenly spotted a cruise ship nearby. Hearing this, the excited ant was about to take a look, but Donald suddenly dashed toward his raft. The aunt tried to follow, then noticed Donald's hat had fallen off. Thinking it should help pick it up, it turned around only to find Donald had already paddled away. The little aunt was about to shout after him, but suddenly stopped. It seemed to understand something. Just then, Donald tossed back the fishing line. It turned out he'd rushed off so fast to Stop the cruise ship. And he'd never forgotten his old friend.

Gunshots kept ringing out along with screams from classmates. To avoid being discovered by the shooter, both stood on the toilet seats. They were absolutely terrified. But gunfire suddenly stopped and they thought it was over. Just then, a man burst in. They quickly covered their mouths, afraid to make any sound. But an earring accidentally dropped. I'm not the shooter. It's Matt Cordell. I saw him. Do you know who he is now? The person who came and wasn't the shooter. He said he had just witnessed the shooting scene. His brother was also killed and he was scared out of his mind looking at the blood covered man. Both girls were terrified. Fear overwhelmed all three of them and one even threw up from fright.

But on his way to the store, Homer got distracted by the smell of barbecue, ran across the street, and was immediately hooked. The grill owner showed Homer his beehive shaped barbecue smoker made from a meteorite and said he just happened to be selling it. Homer couldn't resist and bought it on the spot, which made Marge furious. To make it up to her, Homer decided to fix everything with great food. The smoker turned out to be magical. Everything it cooked was unbelievably delicious. Even Marge was won over by the smoker, and soon the entire town was showing up for Homer's barbecue.

 #MLBTradeDeadline #Phillies #BaseballUpdates #SportsNews#USA","usa,phillies,sportsnews,mlbtradedeadline,baseballupdates","On Thanksgiving afternoon, Marge announced it was time to take the annual Christmas photo. Everyone groaned, but Marge insisted that once they grew up, they'd understand. Flash forward 30 years, Bart and the others were all grown up. Bart couldn't even afford his rent and his ex wife had just dumped their two kids on him. The kids weren't exactly thrilled about it either. Meanwhile, Millhouse was still suffering from constant allergies, annoying everyone around him. And Bart's son was rebellious just like Bart used to be. Maggie was expecting a baby, though no one knew who the father was. Back at home, Marge got worried that the kids were coming over and to her surprise, they actually showed up. Bart found decorating the Christmas tree incredibly boring. And since Maggie couldn't teleport home while pregnant, she had to fly back on an illegal plane. Marge was thrilled. Either way, Lisa was growing more frustrated with her rebellious daughter and Marge not understanding her only made things worse. Homer, on the other hand, was excited to babysit the grandkids, even taking them to some pretty dangerous places. While riding in a car, Maggie went into labor and Nelson had to floor it to get her to the hospital. Meanwhile, Lisa and Bart had a heart to heart. Lisa was starting to wonder if she should have married Nelson after all. They still kept in touch. Bart, thanks to a court ordered behavior, chip had become oddly responsible. They both opened Up and gained a new understanding of each other. Homer was still happily dragging the kids around, and both Bart and Lisa decided it was time to reconnect with their own children. Bart called out to the giant tree to lower them back down. Lisa rushed to apologize to Marge. Bart showed his kids an old Kootis show. Maggie was still in labor and Bart couldn't understand how Homer had turned into such a good grandpa. Lisa entered the virtual world trying to reach her daughter. Inside her daughter's digital room, she discovered her daughter actually did care and they finally made up. Homer took the grandkids to visit Grandpa Abe just to prove that most kids eventually think their dads are the worst. Bart reconciled with his kids and Homer made peace with Abe. Marge and Maggie returned home with the Newborn baby. And with the help of two highly evolved pets, they finally snapped the perfect Christmas photo.

But during the college entrance exam, I couldn't even move my pen. Because in every test before, Tony had always helped me answer the questions. But that day, Tony got stuck in traffic. Looking at my incomplete hands, I suddenly felt completely helpless. I didn't want my three years of hard work to go to waste. So I tried to flip open the paper with my mouth and bite the pen just to write my name. But no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't do it. When the exam ended, I was filled with despair. In a fit of hopelessness, I went straight to the rooftop. At that moment, I wanted to end my miserable life. Because before the exam even started, when Tony still hadn't shown up, I tried asking strangers passing by for help. But not a single person was willing to lend a hand. In the end, I placed my last hope on the Proctor. But to my shock, even the teacher gave up on me. Now I no longer have the right to blame anyone. What made it worse was that the minister of the Interior's daughter decided to go shopping that day. So she used her father's power to block off the roads, which accidentally trapped Tony halfway. By the time Tony finally reached school, it was already too late. As he rushed desperately toward the rooftop, he heard the screams of the crowd. Below. Because I had chosen to end my life in this. Tony was devastated. At the same time, my brother also arrived. He had gotten my message asking for help. But he too was stuck in traffic. He had even asked a police officer by the roadside for help. But the officer's response left him heartbroken. And just like that, death separated me and my brother forever. But my brother wanted to seek justice for me. So he went straight to the police station to report the minister's daughter. Yet when the chief heard his words. He just gave a subtle signal to his men. Quietly pass the message to the minister. Little did he know. That same night, my brother was kidnapped by gangsters. And brutally tortured to death. In this city, the minister's word was law. He wouldn't allow anyone to threaten his power. But there was one man who couldn't stand the evil. And that man was Tony.

But that night, I was forced to share a bed with a stranger. For two decades, I'd lived disguised as a man, working as a waiter in a luxury hotel for the rich. In a world harsh and unfair to women, pretending to be a man was the only way to survive. For 20 years, no one ever suspected the truth. Everyone thought it was just a I had skinny man. I kept everything in perfect order, handling every task with care. After work, I go back to my tiny room, count the tips I made that day, and stash away my growing savings. Then one day, the hotel owner hired a painter and decided to put him in my room. I tried to refuse again and again, but it didn't work. So I waited until he fell asleep before sneaking back in. When I saw my hidden savings untouched, I finally breathed again. Still dressed, I lay down to rest. But a sudden itch woke me up. A flea was crawling on my skin. I had no choice but to unbutton my shirt. And that's when he woke up. In that instant, my secret, buried for 20 years, was exposed. Your channel, Mister Paige. I begged him to keep it quiet. Beg him? He won't tell a soul. Mister Paige, stop a poor woman from making a living. It will be the end of me. I don't wanna finish Up in the poor house. No! No! Get him off the floor! No! Get out of here, son! I'm gonna fucking hotel! Who told you that? Now stop with your knives! Alright, alright. Just get out of here! Thankfully, he wasn't a bad man. He understood how hard life had been for me and promised not to tell a soul. But I couldn't calm down. The next day, I kept trying to be kind to him, hoping to ease my fear. He noticed my unease. Then he turned, closed the door and began to unbutton his own shirt.

They got nastier when I refused. Heather called my employer, claiming I was harassing their family. Nolan showed up at my apartment with two men. He called witnesses, tried to force their way in with papers, started sending photos of my dad with messages like he doesn't even remember you exist and signing would give you closure. The worst was a video of him mumbling in his sleep while Heather asked if he wanted to see his daughter. When he said yes, she told him I was on my way, then filmed him waiting for hours for someone who wasn't allowed to come. Two weeks ago, the nurse called at midnight. My dad was dying. Maybe hours left. I rushed to the hospital, begged security to let me through. They called Nolan, who came down looking annoyed at being woken, stood there in his expensive jacket, telling security I was delusional, that his stepfather never had other children. I pulled out my birth certificate, childhood photos, anything to prove I was his daughter. Heather arrived and started screaming that I was causing a scene during their father's final moments. I was trying to steal their grief. Security started moving me toward the exit while I could hear machines beeping upstairs. He died at Sunrise. The funeral home called Nolan first. Out of habit, he started making arrangements for a service that didn't include me. That's When the estate lawyer called us all in for the reading, Nolan and Heather showed up in designer clothes they'd bought with the fundraiser money. Already. Discussing which properties they'd take, the lawyer started reading. My dad had been broke for years before the stroke. The house they'd sold had three mortgages. The savings they'd spent were loans he'd taken against his life insurance. The medical bills they'd been paying were a fraction of what was owed, $3 million in debt between medical costs and previous loans. But here was the best part. They'd signed as guarantors on everything, as his medical proxies. Every debt was now legally theirs. The fundraiser money they'd spent on themselves had to be returned or they'd face fraud charges. The designer clothes, the cars, the vacations, all of it bought with money meant for medical bills, they were now personally responsible for. Heather fainted. Actually fainted? No. Colin tried to argue they've been tricked. The lawyer explained that power of attorney meant taking on financial responsibility, not just control. They've been so eager to cut me out, they've never read what they were signing. I inherited nothing because there was nothing to inherit. But I also inherited no debt because they'd made sure my name wasn't on anything.

Not my last name or my parents money, just me. I took a deep breath. Sarah, I loved you, past tense. She noticed I spent two years building myself into someone your parents would approve of, not because I needed their approval, but because I wanted to prove them wrong. And you know what? I realized what? It didn't matter. They were never going to accept me and you were never going to stand up to them until now, she whispered. Two years too late. I, you let them convince you I wasn't enough. And instead of fighting for us, you walked away, too. I didn't see you chasing after me. That's not fair, isn't it? I asked gently. You chose their approval over us. I don't blame you for that, but I can't be your backup plan when the approved option doesn't work out. I'm not here because Jonathan didn't work out. I'm here because I finally realized what I lost stood. I love you. I know, but love isn't enough when you won't fight for it. She started crying again. So that's it. We're done. We've been done for two years. I'm just finally accepting it. What about everything we had? I smiled sadly. We had potential, but potential doesn't mean anything if you don't fight for it when it matters. Sarah left that night broken, lost. I felt terrible, but I also Felt free. Three months later, I met Emma at a charity car show. She was a teacher, down to earth, real. We talked for hours. She didn't care that I owned a business, didn't care about money or status. She cared about who I was. Six months later, I introduced her to my family. My mom pulled me aside. She's wonderful. She is not like Sarah. No, she's better. She chose me when I had nothing to prove. Last month, I proposed. Emma said yes. We're getting married in the fall. Small ceremony, just people who matter. I heard through mutual friends that Sarah's doing okay, working at a non profit, living on her own, finally standing up to her parents. I'm happy for her, really, but I don't regret my decision. You'll never be good enough for our daughter. Her father's words haunted me for years, pushed me to prove him wrong. But in the end, I realized something. I was always good enough. Sarah just needed to believe it, too. And by the time she did, I'd already moved on. Not out of spite, not, not out of revenge, but because I finally understood my worth and I wasn't going to settle for someone who took two years and a failed engagement to see it. Sometimes the best revenge isn't proving people wrong. It's building a life so good that their opinion stops mattering. Her parents said I'd never be good enough. Turns out I was always enough. Just not for them. And that was perfectly fine with me.

I agreed, packed my things and left. Two years later, she knocked on my door crying. But what I told her changed everything. You'll never be good enough for our daughter. Her father said it at Sunday dinner. I was sitting across from him, fork halfway to my mouth. Her mother nodded in agreement. Sarah deserves someone with ambition, with a future, not a mechanic. I was 24, working in an auto shop, saving every penny, going to community college at night for business management. But to them, I was grease under fingernails, blue collar beneath their daughter. Sarah squeezed my hand under the table. Don't listen to them. But I was listening. Her father continued. We've supported this relationship long enough. It's time Sarah found someone appropriate, someone from her world. I set down my fork, looked at Sarah, at her parents. You're right. Sarah's eyes widened. What? I'm not good enough for her. Not the way I am now. I stood. So I'm going to leave. Stop wasting her time. Stop holding her back. Sarah jumped up. No, you're not doing this. Yes, I am. I looked at her parents. Thank you for dinner, for the clarity. I walked out. Sarah followed me to my truck. You're really leaving? You deserve better than this. Then constantly defending me to them. I kissed her forehead. If we're meant to be, we'll find our way back. I drove away, didn't look back. The break up nearly destroyed me, but it also focused me. I stopped going to bars, stopped wasting money, stopped making excuses. I finished my degree in 18 months, used my savings to buy the failing auto shop where I worked, rebranded it, modernized it, built a reputation for honest work and fair prices. Within a year, I had three locations. Within two, I had eight. I hired good people, paid them well, treated them with respect. Business exploded. By year two, I was clearing half a million annually. Bought a house. Nothing flashy, just solid. I dated occasionally, nothing serious. Part of me was still hung up on Sarah. Then one night my doorbell rang. Sarah stood there, mascara running, eyes swollen. Can we talk? Let her in. She sat on my couch shaking. I made a mistake. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life. What happened? I got engaged to Jonathan, the guy my parents set me up with, lawyer, Ivy League, perfect on paper. She wiped her eyes. He's awful, controlling, condescending, makes me feel small. And my parents love him because he looks good at parties. I stayed quiet. I called off the wedding yesterday. My parents disowned me, said I'm ungrateful that I'm throwing away my future. She looked up at me. I.

She laid them out on the table one by one like she'd practiced this presentation. My dad has been stealing from my college fund for eight months, she said. Clearly, he's gambling online every night. I have bank statements showing he took $23,000. Detective Walsh picked up the first document. It was indeed a bank statement with my name on it, showing transfers from an education savings account, my checking account. Natalie made a sound like she'd been punched. I started to speak, but Walsh held up her hand. Lily continued. He told me in river that we'd have money for college, but he's been lying. I checked the account using Mom's computer when she thought I was doing homework. Balance is almost zero now. The next item Lily presented was a printed screenshot showing my laptop screen open to an online poker site. She'd somehow captured it with time stamps showing 2:00am from last Monday. I remembered that night I'd been sure I could win back what I'd lost, just one more hand. The screenshot showed my balance negative 40 eight hundred dollars. He's always on his laptop late at night, Lily explained to the detective. He says he's working, but I heard him swearing at his computer. I waited until he fell asleep and took pictures with Mom's phone. There were six more screenshots, each from different nights. Each showing different gambling sites, each showing me deeper in the hole. Total losses added up to more than just the college fund, way more. Detective Walsh looked at Natalie Missus Reeves. Did you know about any of this? Natalie shook her head, tears streaming down her face. She'd grabbed river and was holding him so tight he was squirming. I tried to explain that I was going to pay it back, that I just hit a bad streak, that I had a system that would work. But the words sounded pathetic, even to me. Officer Brennan asked if I wanted to stop talking and maybe consult a lawyer. Lily wasn't finished. She pulled out phone records showing something no one had expected.

The officers arrived while we were singing Happy Birthday. Two uniformed police and a woman in plain clothes carrying a badge and clipboard walked straight through our backyard gate, while my daughter Lily sat at the head of the picnic table with her hands folded in her lap. Wait! The singing stopped midverse. Seventeen children and their parents froze with cake forks halfway to their mouths. Natalie dropped the camera she'd been using to record the moment. The female officer, whose badge read Detective Walsh, walked directly to Lily and knelt beside her chair. You're the one who called. Lily nodded once, then pointed at me. That's my dad. He needs to be arrested. My hands went numb. The backyard spun. Every parent stared at me with identical expressions of horror and disgust. Miss Missus Pemberton grabbed her twins and started backing toward the gate. Mister Lou pulled out his phone and started recording. I opened my mouth to explain, to defend myself, to say anything that would make sense of what was happening. But nothing came out except a strangled sound that made me look even more guilty. Detective Walsh asked everyone except immediate family to leave, which triggered a mass exodus that felt like being abandoned during a house fire. Parents grabbed their children and ran, leaving behind wrapped presents and half eaten cake. Within 90 Seconds, our backyard went from Celebration to crime scene. Lily's best friend Sophie was physically carried away by her mother, who shot me a look that could have strip paint. Bounce house rental company guy unplugged his equipment and left without asking for payment. Natalie stood frozen by the cake table, her face completely white. Our son, river, who was six, started crying and asking why everyone was leaving his sister's party. Detective Walsh's partner, Officer Brennan, positioned himself between me and Lily, like I might lunge for her. I raised my hand slowly, trying to show I wasn't a threat. But the gesture made me look like I was surrendering, which maybe I was. Lily sat perfectly still in her birthday crown, watching me with an expression I'd never seen before. Not scared, not angry, just cold and determined. Detective Walsh asked Lily to explain why she'd called 9 1 1 from her mother's phone during her own birthday party. And Lily reached under the picnic table where she'd apparently stashed a backpack we hadn't noticed. She pulled

They thought they'd inherited everything, but they fainted when they found out the truth. My step brother Nolan and step sister Heather decided I wasn't family. The day our parents married, I, I was 12, they were 16 and 18. Started small, forgetting to tell me about dinner plans, family photos without me. By the time I was 15, I was officially uninvited from everything, Christmas, Thanksgiving, birthdays, all of it. I told my dad I was choosing to stay away, that I was upset about the marriage. He believed them because they were older, more convincing. When he had his stroke three years ago, they told the hospital I wasn't. Immediate family put themselves as the only contacts, the only ones allowed information. I found out he was in a coma from a neighbour two weeks after it happened. Drove straight to the hospital, but security stopped me. My name was on a restricted list. Nolan had told them I was a disturbed ex girlfriend who'd been stalking the family. I tried everything to see my father, called the hospital administrators, sent letters, even hired a lawyer with money I didn't have. Nolan and Heather had power of attorney, medical proxy, everything. They'd convinced my dad to sign papers before the stroke, told him it was just standard planning. I spent three years getting updates from a Nurse who felt bad for me, meeting her at coffee shops where she'd risk her job to tell me if he was stable. Meanwhile, Nolan and Heather played devoted children on social media, posted daily updates about their vigil, their sacrifice, how hard it was being the only family, started a fundraiser for his medical bills that raised $40,000. Never mentioned they'd already sold his house and emptied his savings, paying for their own debts while he lay unconscious. I worked three jobs trying to save money for legal fees to fight them every holiday alone while they posted family photos around his hospital bed. Six months ago, they started pressuring me to sign documents, said it would be easier for everyone if I formally gave up any claim to inheritance, promised if I signed, they'd add me to the visitor list. I almost did it just to see him one more time. But then.

So I invited her to the birthday party. My daughter Josie is 8 years old and the sweetest kid you'll ever meet. She's the type who writes thank you notes without being asked, shares her lunch with kids who forget theirs and cries during those sad animal alter commercials. This year, she wanted a small birthday party at our house, just her closest friends and some backyard games. Nothing fancy, just the kind of simple Celebration where kids can be kids. At the start of the school year, Josie came home crying. A girl named Becky had spent the entire recess telling everyone that Josie's family was poor because we drive an old car. Becky told the other kids that Josie's clothes looked like they came from the trash and so our entire family is trash, that nobody should be friends with her. I held my daughter while she sobbed into my shoulder and I felt that mama bear rage building in my chest. The next day it got worse. Becky knocked Josie's lunch tray out of her hands in the cafeteria, the food splattering everywhere while other kids laughed. Josie had to eat the school's backup peanut butter sandwich in the bathroom because she was too embarrassed to go back. Then Becky started tripping her in gym class, making it look like accidents. The gym teacher never saw it happen, but Josie came home with bruised knees. Three Days in a. By the end of the week, Becky was spreading rumors that Josie cheated on tests, that she picked her nose when no one was looking, that she still wore pull UPS at night. I called the school principal and demanded a meeting, said they'd look into it, but explained that Becky's mom was on the PTA board and a major donor to the school, so they needed to handle it delicately. My daughter was being tormented and they wanted to handle it delicately. Josie stopped wanting to go to school. She'd start crying on Sunday nights just thinking about Monday morning. She'd fake stomach aches and headaches, begging me to let me stay home. I watched my happy, confident little girl shrink into someone who was afraid of her own shadow. Then one afternoon, Josie came to me with the most unexpected request. She asked if Becky could come to her birthday party. I thought she was joking. She wasn't. I asked her why on earth she'd want to.

Then I saw a text that made me call the police. I'd known Valerie for eight years. She'd always been intense. But lately something felt really off. She'd blow up my phone with 10 texts in a row if I didn't respond within minutes. Six weeks ago, she called me with this manic energy in her voice. I met someone. You have to meet him, please. I agreed. We met at a coffee shop the next day with her boyfriend, Trevor. 20 minutes into our conversation, Valerie grabbed both our hands across the table and squeezed hard. I think the three of us should be together, I laughed nervously. Wait, what? Valerie's face was completely serious. She squeezed harder until it hurt. I'm serious. The three of us. It's meant to be. My brain couldn't process this. This was my best friend. Trevor's polyamorous. You're what's been missing from my life. You have to say yes. I yanked my hand away. Val, I love you as a friend. That's it. I'm not interested. Her face went blank like she was a different person. Just think about it. I could barely speak. There's nothing to think about. She stood up. You'll change your mind. That night at midnight, my phone lit up. Have you thought about it? I felt sick. The next morning, three more texts. I know you're scared, but we're perfect together. This is fate. I typed back, shaking that I Already said, no, please stop. She responded instantly, you don't mean that. Then came the articles about polyamory, voice messages explaining why we belong together. My phone wouldn't stop buzzing. Then one night someone knocked. I opened it and Valerie was there with Trevor and her face scared me. Can we please just talk about this? She pushed past me into my apartment. I felt panicked. She sat on my couch and ignored everything I've been saying. For 20 minutes, she talked about destiny and soulmates. When I got them to leave, she hugged me too long and whispered in my ear, I'll wait for you to come around. She came back the next day and knocked for 10 minutes. I watched through the people. The day after that, more knocking. I felt trapped. Then my friend Casey texted asking if Val's news was true. I went pale. Valerie was telling people I'd agreed. I had to explain she was lying. That's when Trevor started texting.

Now he's broke and alone in the mansion he lied in. I found out my husband hadn't worked in two years. When I ran into his former co worker at the grocery store. She asked how Roger was enjoying retirement. I said he wasn't retired. He left for work every morning at 7:30. She looked confused and said they laid him off during company downsizing in 2022. I stood there holding a calculator because I was trying to keep our groceries under $60. Meanwhile, Roger had been sitting on his dead parents money this whole time. For two years I've been clipping coupons, shopping sales, telling our kids we couldn't afford new school shoes yet. I work double shifts at the nursing home, picked up weekend hours cleaning offices. Sold my grandmother's jewellery to cover our son's dental work. Roger would come home at 5:30 every day, complaining about his boss, talking about difficult clients, even brought home fake paperwork. Sometimes he'd give me his paycheck every two weeks, always just enough to cover basic bills, sometimes less because of reduced hours or equipment costs or mandatory unpaid training. I'd skip meals so the kids could eat. Wore the same three scrubs on rotation for two years because new ones cost too much. Cancelled my doctor appointments because the co pays were $40. Our Daughter quit dance class. Our son couldn't join travel baseball. I told them daddy worked hard, but money was tight. He never complained. Meanwhile, Roger's parents had died three years ago and left him everything. The house, the investments, the savings accounts. He told me they'd left some small bonds that wouldn't mature for decades. After talking to his coworker, I drove straight to his parents Old House, found his car parked in the driveway. He was inside watching television on a 70 inch screen I'd never seen before. The place was fully furnished. Renovated kitchen, new appliances. There was a gaming system, a pool table in the basement, a fully stocked bar. Mail on the counter showed statements from investment accounts. Seven figures across multiple

Not doing anything wrong, just standing too close while she laughed at something he'd said. She was wearing the dress I bought her for our anniversary, the one she'd said was too nice for regular wear. Kyle was eating a sandwich she'd made, cut diagonally the way she knew I liked but never did for me anymore. They jumped apart when I walked in. Lisa said Kyle had fixed the garbage disposal. I checked later. It had never been broken. Started coming home at random times, always found evidence Kyle had just left fresh Cologne smell two coffee cups, his favorite snacks, in our pantry.

Lisa's face lit up for the first time in months, started talking about houses we could buy, vacations we could take, how proud she was. Kyle went quiet. Then he told us his news. He'd been fired three weeks ago. His company discovered he'd Been stealing client funds, small amounts over years. His house was being foreclosed. His car was getting repossessed. He needed to move back with our parents, but they said no. Lisa's face went through 17 expressions. Asked him to repeat himself, he explained he'd been using the money to fund his lifestyle, that his promotion had been fake, just a title he'd given himself. The expensive clothes, the house, the car, all built on theft. He was looking at prison time. Lisa turned to me and asked about my promotion details. When I started explaining, Kyle interrupted to ask if we had room for him to stay. Lisa said absolutely not. Kyle reminded her of all the times he helped her, all the repairs, all the favors. She said those weren't favors if he was using them to case our house for things to steal. He insisted he'd never steal from family. She, he laughed, said stealing from strangers wasn't better. Kyle looked at me for support, but I was busy watching my wife realize she'd spent five years worshipping a fraud. She asked him to leave when he was gone. She tried to apologize. I told her I needed space to think about our marriage. She said that was fair, but asked about the promotion money first. Some prizes aren't consolation, after all.

Sealed, marked open. Only if the kids fight. He'd written, if you cannot treat Connor's children the way you treat Gwen's, step aside. Do not dishonor their names. Do not dishonor mine. I filed a petition to remove her as trustee. Breach of FID. Fiduciary duty, unequal distribution, financial mismanagement. The court hearing was quiet, clinical.

It was watching them grow up knowing they were loved unconditionally. That no one could decide they were less important and get away with it.

My daughters, Melissa, 10, and Riley, 8, still in their grass stained soccer uniforms from practice looked down at those cheap paper napkins, then up at me with confused, wounded eyes.

Perfectly portioned pasta, slices of tiramisu stacked like edible towers. This wasn't new. Gwen, 38, has been the golden child since birth.

It's not a family vacation, she laughed. It's a treat for the girls. Our girls are your granddaughters, too, page said. Voice suddenly ice. I'm sure they'll get to go someday.

They never would. And my daughters were learning the same painful lesson I'd Learned as a kid. So I stopped waiting. Three weeks later, I got a call from my father's old lawyer named Gerald. Turns out dad had set up a 60 thousand dollar trust for all his grandchildren before he died 10 years ago. My mom was the trustee, the one person who should have protected his wishes. Your sister signed her paperwork three years ago. He said her daughters have already received early dispersments, roughly $10,000 each for educational enrichment. My daughters, zero. I hung up, sat in silence for a long moment. Then I called a financial advisor named Denise who came highly recommended from a colleague. We found everything false.

I warned my neighbor that his garage door sensor was broken, and he brushed me off saying I was paranoid. I work as an electrician, and I've been doing residential wiring for about six years now, specializing in home safety systems. Last Tuesday, I was coming home from work around 5 p m. And I noticed something off with his garage door. It was closing way too fast, and the safety sensor light wasn't blinking like it should. His two kids were playing basketball in the driveway and kept running in and out of the garage to grab drinks and basketballs. Every single time that door came down, I felt this knot in my stomach getting tighter and tighter. I walked over and knocked on his door. He opened it looking annoyed, like I was interrupting his dinner or something important. Your garage door sensor is malfunctioning. The safety beam isn't working properly, and that door could seriously hurt someone. He rolled his eyes and leaned against the door frame with his arms crossed. It's been like that for months now. Works fine. Nobody's gotten hurt yet, so I don't see the problem. I pulled out my phone and showed him the video I had just taken. Look at how fast it's closing. See how the sensor lights aren't on at all? If someone walks under it, the door won't stop. It'll come straight down on them with full force. He Barely glanced at my phone screen. I've lived here for 15 years. I know my own house and my own garage door better than some stranger who just moved in six months ago. I tried explaining that I literally installed these exact systems for a living, and I can tell when something's wrong. I pointed at the sensor on the side of his garage. That wire right there is disconnected. I can see it hanging from here. The sensor isn't communicating with the motor at all. He cut me off mid sentence. Stop trying to drum up business in my neighborhood. I'm not paying you to fix something that isn't broken just so you can make a quick fuck off me. His wife came to the door asking what all the commotion was about. I explained the whole situation to her, showing her the video and pointing out the disconnected wire hanging there. He interrupted, saying I was exaggerating the danger to make money off them and that I probably go door to door doing this to everyone. She looked at me apologetically, but said they talked about it later and close the door in my face. I went back to my house feeling frustrated and worried. I even called the non emergency police line asking if they could do some kind of safety check or wellfare check. They said it was private property and unless there was an immediate threat to life, they couldn't force him to fix anything. I asked what qualified as an immediate threat. The dispatcher said someone would have to actually get hurt first before they could intervene. I spent that whole evening thinking about those two kids running in and out.

She kicked me out saying find somewhere else to live or die. I don't care. You're useless now. Days later, the lawyer laughed. Did you even read the will? My wife went pale because the will said, when my father in law, Richard Hayes, died, I thought grief might finally humble my wife, Clarissa. Instead, it made her cruel. Richard was old school, built the business empire from scratch, worth over $33 million, plus a mansion on the hill that looked like something from a magazine. I sat by his bedside during his last months, feeding him soup, listening to his stories while Clarissa was too stressed to visit. When he passed, she didn't cry. She opened champagne. At the reading of the will, Clarissa wore a black designer dress that probably cost more than my car. She crossed her legs, smirked and waited for her name to be called. When the lawyer announced that she'd inherited everything, she didn't blink. She just said, well, it's about time. That night she looked me dead in the eye and said, you know what, Darren, you can leave now. I don't need you anymore. I thought she was joking. She wasn't. Three days later, I came home from work to find my things in garbage bags by the front door. What's going on, I asked. She didn't even look up from her phone. Find somewhere else to live or die. I Don't care. You're useless now. I just stood there, 7 years of marriage erased in a sentence. When I didn't move, she rolled her eyes. Don't make this dramatic. I'll Venmo you for gas. She handed me my car keys like she was tossing scraps to a stray. I left. No yelling, no begging, just violence. I drove to the Sunset Motel, $49 a night, flickering neon sign that said Sue a mole instead of sunset. The carpet smelled like mold and bad visions. I sat on the bed staring at the water stained ceiling and thought Richard would never have wanted this. That's when it hit me. Richard planned everything. The man had color coded files for his sock drawer. Would he really hand $33 million to a daughter who couldn't even pay her own credit card Bill without crying? I remembered something he'd said six months before he died. We were watching an old war movie together when he turned to me and said, you're a good man, Darren. Better than this fan.

You can do it. Come on. To rescue his teammate, Thomas successfully crossed the maze at the last moment. Good job. Just kill yourself. How to survive in this maze was now the most critical issue. The maze was already changing. Another teammate wanted to escape alone. Can't just leave him here. The group dragged their injured teammate deeper into the maze. Send him down. Send him down. After walking for who knows how long, the two still couldn't find an exit. Teammate Nino once again had thoughts of giving up. He wanted to go alone to search for a chance of survival. The two of them got into an argument about this issue. You don't get it. We're already dead. Hearing Mino say this, Thomas immediately fell into deep thought. At this moment, he walked forward and saw vines on the wall. An idea of how to help his teammate suddenly came to his mind. Using the vines to pull his teammate to the highest point would save their life. The sky was approaching evening. Monster roars could already be heard from the corners. Sorry, green. What? Green? At the last moment, Mino completely abandoned the two of them. Suddenly, he crawled into a cave below. At this moment, he didn't dare to breathe. Monster passed right in front of him. Only after the monster left did he slowly poke his head out. Finally, he secured his teammate firmly, but the sound he made attracted the Monster back. Thomas hurried. He looked for nearby cover. But when Thomas turned back around, the monster had already disappeared. In a daze, Thomas stepped on the monster's secreted slime. At this moment, the monster had quietly crawled above his head. Wow. Faced with a desperate situation, Thomas burst forth with tremendous strength. Come on, Thomas. Don't look back. Thomas. Early the next morning, the maze reopened. Seeing no one ahead, the teammates held no hope for their survival, told each other not coming back. They were all prepared to leave. But at this moment, Thomas and two others walked side by side. They gained new freedom at this moment.

Because last night, I burned my three children alive. Two officers sat across from me. They took notes while gently asking me to recall what happened last night. I was drinking at home with my friends. It got pretty late. My wife got upset. She said the kids needed to sleep and told everyone to leave. But I didn't want the night to end. After they left, I finished the rest of the booze alone, then tossed a few more logs into the fireplace and stepped out to buy more alcohol. I forgot to close the fire screen, but I brushed it off, told myself it'd be fine. When I came back home, I froze. The whole house was on fire. I couldn't get inside. I stood there helpless. The firefighters pulled out two black bags. Inside were my daughter's remains. Here my wife screamed until she passed out. They had to take her away in an ambulance. They said it wasn't a crime. They spoke softly, even got me a ride home. But that kindness only made the pain worse. So when one officer passed by, I grabbed his gun, put it to my head without a second thought. But the chamber was empty. I panicked and tried to unlock the safety. They tackled me to the ground. That fire destroyed my home. In my marriage. I left Manchester, a city filled with pain and memories, moved to Boston and lived Alone. I worked all kinds of jobs, never complained. But no one ever thanked me. I always looked like a corpse. Like I wasn't even alive. Then one day I got a call from Manchester. They said my brother had a heart attack. It was bad. I drove like a madman to get there. But I was too late. By the time I reached the hospital, he was already gone. The funeral was huge. My nephew stood up front. He greeted every guest. So young, but calm and steady. Like a grown man. In that moment, he became the backbone of the family. Him and me. I felt like I didn't belong. I stood in a corner, lost. When people came to offer condolences, I just nodded, said nothing. My ex wife showed up with her new husband.

Every time she came back from the supermarket, she would recite a flawless ad script like she had rehearsed it 100 times. Even when she made me a cup of hot chocolate. Why don't you let me fix you some of this new mo Coco drink? All natural cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua, no artificial sweeteners. I looked at her completely confused. I asked what she was doing, but she pretended not to hear me and kept praising those products with a smile. This is the best. What the hell does this have to do with anything? Tell me what's happening. That moment, my patience finally ran out. I yelled at her in anger. Dice me, slice me up. So many choices. No, do something. She suddenly looked up and screamed for help toward the ceiling. I realized something huge was hiding behind all this. She tried to run. I chased after her, wanting to know the truth. Then came a knock on the door. Reyman. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. It was my best friend dropping by for a beer. We sat by the bridge. I told him I felt like the whole world revolved around me. He paused for a moment, then quickly changed the subject, talking about our childhood. He even raised his hand, swearing he would never lie to me. The point is, I would gladly step in front of Traffic for you. True. The last thing I'd ever do is lie to you. The last thing that I would ever do. He's lying to me. I believed him. I always trust too easily. But coincidences kept piling up and I started to doubt everything around me. One day I just wanted to feel the ocean breeze. Suddenly, it started to rain. No matter where I went, the rain followed me. Fear started to crawl in ladder. I looked at our wedding photo and noticed something strange. My wife's fingers were tightly crossed, the gesture for seeking forgiveness. It meant our marriage was a lie. I didn't confront her. I wanted to see what she was hiding. That day, she finished another ad and said she had an emergency surgery at the hospital. As she walked out, I gently tapped her shoulder. She froze, then smiled that same fake smile and hurried away. I followed her to the hospital where she worked. As soon as I entered, a nurse stopped me like I was an intruder. I smiled, said I just had a message for my wife, then pretended to leave, but quietly followed her instead. In the hallway, a man in a wheelchair rushed toward me. I stepped aside only to be blocked by a nurse pushing a cart. My heart was pounding. I shoved the cart away and ran into the operating room. But what I saw inside was the worst act I'd ever seen.

The boss had become the whale's breakfast. Fortunately, the communication was not cut off and 9, 1, 1 quickly identified the location. That was a humpback whale, which means it hasn't been truly swallowed yet, as humpback whales have very narrow throats and can't swallow adult whales. As long as it opens its mouth to eat again, it may be spat out. But the greatest danger at present is oxygen deficiency. We must keep calm. The fire brigade was dispatched urgently and soon located the target. Air support takes 12 minutes. The oxygen supply is likely insufficient and it must be forced to surface. The captain suddenly realized humpback whales have extremely acute hearing. They used a cone as a loud speaker, connected it to a fire alarm and injected 120 decibels of noise into the bay through pipes. All right, Eddie hit the Siren. Sure enough, the noise was too loud and the whale eventually spat out the boss. The team members immediately jumped into the water to rescue him, but by the time they reached the shore, he had already stopped breathing. After a round of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a miracle occurred and the boss survived. However, when the company's call was connected, everyone was celebrating the company's rebirth. But the expression on the vice president's face was thought provoking.

He had been trapped in the luxury car for three days and nights. The only source of water left was a bottle of yellow liquid. But smelling it, he couldn't bring himself to drink it. At that moment, the voice of the car owner came through the display screen. The owner turned out to be an old man. He said he had locked the car doors to punish car thieves like the man. The old man then remotely turned on the car's air conditioning. The man shivered from the cold. He quickly put on clothes to shield himself from the chill, but still said he wasn't cold at all. Little did he know, the car was covered with surveillance cameras, allowing the old man to fully enjoy watching this poor prey. Ten hours passed. The man couldn't stand the cold anymore. Hungry and freezing, he pulled out the gun from his bag to break the door. But the bullet ricocheted and shot into his thigh. Fortunately, a woman happened to walk by on the street. He screamed for help towards the window. He thought he had successfully caught her attention. But strangely, the woman just came to the window and started putting on lipstick. It turned out the old man had already turned the window into a one way mirror. From the outside, you couldn't see inside. And the car had top notch Soundproofing so the gunshot didn't attract the attention of passers by. Mark had no choice but to take off his shoelaces to tie up the wound to stop the bleeding. He begged the old man to let him out and promised to willingly go to the police station and confess. But what he got in return was the old man hanging up the phone. The man slowly passed out from blood loss in despair, but when he woke up again, he found the bullet in his foot had been removed and the wounds were all bandaged. Just as he was puzzled, the rich man called again. The old man found out he was a thief who had been to prison three times, so he decided to give Mark a huge punishment. The car started to automatically accelerate, heading straight for the rooftop. As the car got closer and closer to the top of the building, Mark desperately begged for mercy. But the car still charged up to the rooftop, slamming the gas pedal full speed towards the guardrail.

At first, the couple thought there was something wrong with the camera, say. That is, until the wife rummaged through an antique chest, pulled out a coat, ran to the window and struck a pose. Wasn't this exactly what she looked like in the photo? Mike was so shocked he could barely speak. They decided to try again. This time, the wife stood in front of the front door for a photo. When the picture came out, a young man was pushing the door open. In the shot, it was Mary's brother. But her brother couldn't possibly be here right now because he had just been sentenced to seven years in prison. Mike suspected there was something unusual about this antique camera. Just then, the doorknob suddenly moved and in walked Mary's brother. He explained that he had successfully escaped from prison tonight and came to his sister for refuge. The couple was stunned, speechless, and the pose of the brother opening the door was exactly the same as in the photo. After some discussion, Mike suggested that this camera could capture scenes 5 minutes into the future, and maybe they could use it to do something big. As the couple was envisioning the future, the brother turned on the TV and a horse race was playing on the screen. Mike Stood up excitedly. Since the camera could capture future scenes, if the three of them went to the racetrack, wouldn't they be able to know the race results in advance? So they pulled a few hundred bucks, ready to try their luck at the track. Right away, the three arrived at the race track and precisely timed a photo of the scoreboard. When the photo printed out, the result was clearly visible. Horse No. 6 one. Mike immediately went to place a bet. When the race started, horse No. 6 was in the middle of the pack. However, as it neared the finish line, it suddenly accelerated and crossed the finish line first. The trio couldn't stop grinning. They checked the scoreboard again. The result was exactly the same as shown in the photo. Once successful, they wanted to continue. With ample funds in hand, they only needed to take a photo before each race, and it seemed there was no possibility of failure. So they kept betting. Round after round, every judgment was accurate, and they counted money until their hands cramped. Back at the motel, Mike immediately ordered a sports car. With this camera, they had finally broken free from their predicament at the bottom of society. At this point, the motel attendant came to collect the plates and curiously picked up the camera from the table to fiddle with it. Mike hurriedly reminded him to be careful not to break the camera. The attendant retorted, what does It mean that this camera won't work. After taking 10 photos, this inappropriate hair, that means 10 to an owner. Mike's heart sank. He quickly sent the attendant away. The trio started counting the number of photos they had test shot, two in the room and taken six at the racetrack today, which meant they only had two chances left. Mike decided to do one more big deal tomorrow. While the wife wanted to save it for future use, the brother suggested simply selling the camera for some cash to go eat KFC. The three started arguing and fighting over the camera, accidentally pressing the shutter and wasting another photo. Mike was furious. When the photo appeared, he saw his wife seemingly screaming. Why do you think she's screaming, Woodward? I'll tell you why she's screaming. She's screaming because somebody's trying to do something to her husband. He abruptly pulled out a knife. Since the camera foreshadowed an ominous omen, he decided to strike first. He pushed his wife away and stalked toward the brother. Step by step, the two gradually retreated to the window and soon engaged in an intense fight. The wife also arrived at the position in the photo. In the scuffle, the two men fell out the window, one after another. At the same time, Mary struck the pose from the photo. Having lost her husband and brother, Mary was in extreme agony. However, we must muddle through these things. We must live with tragedy. She Picked up the camera again and went to the window. Simply for posterity. May you both rest in peace. Mary was about to take the money and leave. Suddenly, the attendant from earlier barged in. He had been eavesdropping on their conversation. The attendant grabbed the cash on the table and quickly stuffed it into his bag. Mary tried to call for help, but the attendant said, your brother is a fugitive, right? I think that when the police come, you'll be the first one arrested. He swept away all their spoils and didn't forget to snatch the bag from Mary's hand before leaving. This one I will leave with you. The attendant picked up the photo and said, looking into the distance from this angle, it seems there are more than two bodies. Mary hurried to the window and looked down. I tripped over a wire and fell out the window. The attendant walked to the window, satisfied. Yes, there are more than two bodies down there. One, two, three, four.

I sat down quietly, not daring to fight back. Because my family was poor, I only had a big pair of worn out shoes. I wanted my parents to buy a new pair of shoes. Instead, they gave me my sister's old shoes. I took a marker and blacked out my shoes to avoid being laughed at by the bully. But the bully still found the brake and laughed at me in public. The teacher turned around and saw the disruptive classmate, but she yelled at me. I drew in silence, seeking solace, only to find my sister messing with my sketchbook. I tried to argue with my sister, but she refused to admit it. My father came into the room, concluded that it was my fault and punished me for going to work. Instead, my father played with my sister. I didn't understand why my father favored my sister and just wanted to prove myself in the race. The game starts with money. A girl joined in. Everyone tried to drive her away. I thought she couldn't win and helped her stay. The race started. Even though my shoes didn't fit, I ran at the front. I thought I was sure to win. But the girl came barrelling out from behind me and easily won. She walked towards me and tried to give me a high five. I was so angry that I slapped her away, but then I realized that she was As friendless as I was and sat directly in the bully seat, I hurriedly pulled her away and saved her life. She tried to strike up a conversation with me, which I ignored. I was so enamored with my painting that I didn't notice the girl when I hid my drawing. She handed me a piece of gum and traded me for the sketchbook. I became nervous, afraid of being laughed at, but she gave a compliment. It was the first time I was recognized. On my birthday, my family threw me a party. My father gave me a racing car toy set, but I had long since outgrown it. I wanted to play with my father, but he ordered me to do my homework. The girl heard about my birthday and prepared a set of paints and brushes for me. That's what I really wanted.

It began moving constantly inside his body. Finally, it burrowed straight into his brain. When Jordan woke up, he was a different person. He, who never ate raw meat, bought a whole shipping container of it to keep his wife from noticing. He lied. He told her the container was her birthday gift. As days passed, red patches spread on Jordan's neck. His body was gradually becoming stiff, yet his craving for raw meat grew stronger. One night, Lisa was taking a shower. Jordan extended a tentacle, ready to attack. Fortunately, his reason managed to overpower the urge. Although he didn't harm his wife, the bug compelled him to find a host for reproduction. So Jordan went to his mistress. He made Mary the host for his offspring. From then on, Jordan's condition worsened. Lisa sensed something was wrong, but Jordan brushed it off as a mosquito bite. However, the truth couldn't stay hidden forever. That evening, police came to investigate Mary's disappearance. Witnesses had seen Jordan at her place, and Mary's phone showed calls from him. The police suspected Jordan was the kidnapper. Lisa was devastated by her husband's betrayal. She remembered the locked basement. She was determined to discover its secret. As Lisa opened the door, a foul stench hit her. She slowly pulled back the plastic sheet, revealing a horrifying scene that was too gruesome to look at.

He not only betrayed our marriage, but quietly moved all our assets. I never thought he could be so cruel. But I vowed my revenge would be ruthless. I went straight to his mistress's home. I told her parents that their daughter was having an affair with my husband and she was pregnant. That bomb shattered everyone. Then I filed for divorce. I took back every asset he had moved. Got nothing. Not a penny. Not even custody of our son. He was humiliated and furious. He swore to get revenge. I thought he had no more moves. But he went to the hospital where I worked. He reported me to my boss. He lied that I threatened a patient's family. He smeared me as mentally ill. And he demanded the director fire me. But the truth was, the man had long abused his wife. If I had once warned him that if he kept hurting her, I would take him to court. Now those two joined forces against me. My husband kept insulting me. He said I was broken by my parents, failed marriage. I lost control and slapped him. He used that

At first, I thought some kid was playing a prank. But when I peeked to check, I realised the culprit was my neighbour. So to get back at her, I rushed over and pounded on her door. Just as I was about to confront her, I saw the obvious bruise on her arm and it hit me right away. Maybe she was using that to signal for help. So I swallowed my anger. I made a couple of polite remarks and plan to leave. But right after the door closed, I immediately called the police. Before long, cops showed up. Her husband was taken away for domestic violence. I thought it was finally over. But when she came to thank me with a grateful smile, I noticed part of the bruise was missing. That felt off and made me suspicious and her expression turned cold in an instant. She didn't say another word. Then she just shut the door. In that moment, I felt a strong sense of unease. So I decided to find out the truth. I quietly snuck into her house. What I saw next shocked me to the core. The injuries on her body were all staged. What chilled me even more was a strange man walked out of the room. They smiled at each other and they casually let the truth.

He married his mistress and had a child with the help of his father in law, the mayor. His business was booming. The first thing he did when he came back, he hosted a grand party inviting all the high society to reclaim his lost pride. He shamelessly sent me an invitation. It seemed like everything was aimed at me. But what happened next shocked me. He looked at me with deep affection, telling me he wanted to fix our relationship and that he thought about me every single day for the past two years. It made me sick. I went home and shut the door. I didn't know what his real intentions were. On the night of his party, I went out to dinner with a colleague, but suddenly I received a text message. It was a photo of my son with my ex husband at the party. That was his real plan. He wanted to take our son.

This random woman bit me. Honestly, it didn't hurt as much as you think. Actually felt kind of nice. And she pulled out a bottle of her own blood, told me to drink it. I thought she was joking, so I drank it. Tasted like watermelon juice, honestly. Sweet. Then the woman just disappeared like smoke. When I got back to my dorm, I started feeling really sick. My roommate thought I had the flu. Suddenly my stomach was in an intense pain. I threw up everything. The next day I was lying in bed like I was dead. Couldn't move. My roommate was sweet. Bought me cold medicine. She was reading me the instructions. Then a fly flew right into my eye. I didn't even react. My roommate realized I wasn't breathing. She immediately had Siri call 9 1 1. I'm not sure I got that, Siri. The paramedics came, confirmed I was dead. But right before they were about to take me to the morgue, suddenly set up. What the fuck? I thought you said she was dead. I checked them three times. Oh my. I'm. I'm sorry. You should bail me because I'm still on my parents insurance. Ma'am, you were dead. I'm fine now. So I just wanted to get out of there. Cause the sunlight felt like it was burning my skin. After that, my body started doing even weirder stuff. My reflection in the mirror didn't match. What I was doing. I slowly grew fangs. When I had nightmares at night, I'd float up without realizing it. My roommate freaked out. She grabbed her phone to record it, but she was shaking so much. Just open the camera. And I fell back onto the bed. And it got weirder. I turned into a night person. And I had this unnatural craving for blood, which is crazy because I'm literally a vegetarian. In art class, when I saw a painting of Jesus, I got instant goosebumps all over. My skin became super sensitive. And what's even scarier, sometimes I wanted to rip my roommate to shreds. So I went back to the park to hunt, sneaking around. That's when the woman who bit me showed up again. It is very disgusting for me to see this little one like this. She is like a disabled, very sickly donkey that you want to smash in the skull because it is just too pitiful to look at. Her name is Nadia, a real vampire. She decided to personally teach me how to become a proper vampire. Nadia took me to her huge old house. She said every vampire has a special power. Now she needed to test what mine was so I could hunt my first human. I can fold my tongue like a taco. What's that? Oh, no, no. Not just power. Is wall crawling super impressive. Anywhere her hands could touch, she could just climb up. No effort. Then She told me to try. I didn't get very far, just fell. The noise brought Najah's husband, Lazlo. Najah introduced me, but Lazlo didn't see me at all. Who? Jenna. Who's Jenna? She's right there. Alright. I didn't see you. She should be in a bloody cage! Lazlo! Horrible thing to say. Oh, see what you've done? Ruin her confidence. Damn idiot! Jenna, Lazlo is very sorry and he has something to say. I hid in the room, too upset to come out, until I heard Lazlo apologize and say he'd teach me his best skills. Then I came out. Lazlo decided to test my bat transformation ability. When I turn into a bat, there's no real skill to it at all. I just shout, bat! Human form, your turn! I took a deep breath, shouted. But I turned into this massive, ugly, fat monster. Could barely even fly. Okay, calm down. Just stop screaming. It's terrifying. What would you even call that? I just don't understand. Turning into a bat is the easiest thing for a vampire to do. I'm not disappointed with Jenna's progress so far. So, you know, maybe she doesn't have a special power. So what? She's a below average vampire. Either way, I do think she's very much ready for her first human meal. Nadia took me to a human party. Told me to just seduce anyone and drink their blood. I tried talking to people, but everyone acted like I wasn't even there. Completely Ignored me. I totally lost it. Why does nobody hear me? Ah! Haha! Nadia was super excited because she finally figured out my power. I can go invisible. It's a super rare ability. Now I could finally complete my first hunt. Soon, something weird happened at the party. A guy was being dragged by air. I dragged him outside to the bushes. Enjoyed my first taste of human blood. I was so excited, I asked Nadia if we could watch the sunrise together. But Nadia told me, sadly, I can never be in sunlight again, or I'll burst into a ball of flames. I quickly thought of a solution. I grabbed a motorcycle helmet nearby. Said if I wear the helmet, the sun can't get me. Then we went up to the roof. Turns out reality was nothing like that. And that's how I almost killed my vampire mentor.

My eyes scan the crowd until a man wearing a baseball cap appears in my sight. He becomes my next target. He is fascinated by my appearance and follows me home eagerly. Before anything happens, he falls into the black swamp under my feet. In seconds, his body is completely drained. Only the layer of skin remains. I put on the new skin, paired with black high heels and stockings, and go out again to find the next target. This time, I come to a forest. The ranger sees me alone and thinks I am lost. Evil thoughts arise in his mind and he pins me to the ground. During our struggle, he suddenly finds his hands covered in slime. When he looks up, a large piece of skin on me is torn off. This horrifying scene terrifies.

Hearing my husband's voice, I panicked and quickly put down the pizza. I begged the man in front of me to keep it a secret. Pizza? Are you out of your freaking mind? Come over here, honey. It's not mine. It's a mistake. All you're allowed are cucumbers and water. Luckily, he didn't expose me. My husband's doubts faded for the moment. He impatiently drove the man away, then turned back to warn me again. If you ever come near food like that again, cucumbers and water will be all you eat for the rest of your life. After my husband left, the man quietly slipped back inside. I was miserably chewing on a cucumber, exercising under the robot's watch. He felt sorry for me and even brought me food. I was surprised and grateful. As I ate, while we talked, he asked the question on his mind, why you stay here? He obviously doesn't love you. He's just mocking you. I didn't know how to explain suddenly.

I was 14 when I discovered I was deathly allergic to shellfish. We were at a family barbecue when someone brought shrimp skewers. Three bites in, my throat started closing. My lips swelled. Hives erupted across my arms. My cousin noticed first. Your neck, she said. Look at your neck. Red welts were crawling up from my collar. When I tried to call for help, my voice came out as a raspy whisper. My aunt found me collapsed against the sink. She screamed for my parents. Mom took one look and said, hospital now. We piled into the car, me in the backseat trying to remember how to breathe. Each inhale felt like sucking air through a coffee stirrer. We were maybe two miles from the hospital when my 11 year old sister piped up, can we stop at Starbucks? There's one right here. My vision was blurring and she wanted a Frappuccino. Not now, sweetie, mom said. But her voice was gentle. Negotiable, please, my sister whined. We're literally passing it. I tried to object but could only wheeze. Dad glanced at me in the rearview mirror. We have time, he said. She's still conscious. Still conscious. Those were the words he used to justify pulling into the Starbucks drive through while I was dying in the backseat. The line had six cars. Two minutes became four. Four became seven. My sister Ordered a venti caramel ribbon crunch with extra whipped cream. Mom reminded her to say please. Meanwhile, I was clawing at my throat, trying to force air into lungs that were sealing shut. The woman at the window noticed me. Is she okay? Just car sick, dad lied smoothly. When we finally pulled away, I'd lost feeling in my fingertips. The world was going gray. My sister took a long sip. Thanks, daddy, she said. Nine more minutes to the hospital. I spent them convinced I was going to die listening to her slurp her Starbucks. We screeched into the er bay. Within seconds, nurses surrounded us. I heard someone yell for an Epipen. The epinephrine hit my system like a defibrillator. A doctor leaned over me. You got here just in time, she said. Another few minutes and we'd be having a very different conversation. Just in time. We would have been there 10 minutes earlier if not for the Starbucks stop. But everyone was so relieved I was alive that no one wanted to talk about it. Later, my parents sat beside my hospital bed. We're so glad you're okay, mom said. We were terrified. My sister stood in the corner, still clutching her cup. She wouldn't make eye contact. The next day, they retold the story to relatives. We rushed her to the hospital, dad said. Didn't waste a single second. That was eight years ago. I'm 22 now and I carry two Epipens everywhere. I've had Three more severe allergic reaction since then, each time I drove myself to the hospital.

But my daughter did something that made him turn pale. It was Thanksgiving at his parents house and I should have known better than to show up with store bought dinner rolls. For eight years of marriage to Derek, I had Learned that everything had to be perfect in front of his family or there would be consequences later. But I had been pulling 12 hour shifts at the hospital all week and barely had time to shower, let alone bake homemade bread. His mother, Patricia, made the first comment. As I set the plastic container on her perfectly set dining table, she lifted one roll with her manicured fingers like it might contaminate her entire meal. Well, she said loud enough for the entire room to hear. I suppose not everyone has time for family traditions anymore. 22 family members were crammed into that dining room. His parents, both brothers with their wives, six kids ranging from toddlers to teenagers, and various aunts and uncle who had driven in from neighboring towns. All of them turned to stare at me like I had committed some unforgivable sin. I forced a smile and explained that I had been working overtime at the hospital. Three nurses had called in sick with the flu and someone had to cover the emergency department. I thought they would understand. His father was a retired police officer. His Brothers worked construction. They knew about demanding jobs. But Derek's face was already turning that familiar shade of red that meant trouble was coming. His jaw clenched the way it always did when he thought I had embarrassed him. The vein in his temple started throbbing. You always have an excuse, he said, loudly enough to cut through every conversation in the room. The football game on TV suddenly seemed too loud. Someone's fork clinked against their plate. One of the toddlers asked for more juice, but nobody moved to help him. All eyes were on us now. I'm not making excuses, I said as calmly as I could manage. I'm explaining why I didn't have time to bake this week. That's when he hit me. The slap echoed through the dining room like a gunshot. My cheek exploded in pain, and I could taste blood where my teeth had cut the inside of my lip. The force of it knocked me sideways, and I had to grab the back of a chair to keep from falling. Complete silence fell over the room. Not one person moved. Not one person spoke. His father stared at his plate like it held the secrets of the universe. His mother suddenly developed an intense interest in folding and refolding her napkin. His brothers exchanged a quick glance, but immediately looked away. Even the children had gone completely quiet. Don't you ever embarrass me like that again, Derek hissed through clenched teeth. That's when My 16 year old daughter Chloe stood up from the kids table in the corner. She had been living with us for two years since her father died in a motorcycle accident. Derek had never liked her, always complained that she was too mouthy, too independent, too much like me for his taste. She walked over slowly, deliberately, pulling her phone out of her back pocket as she moved. When she reached where Derek was standing, she held it up and aimed it directly at his face. Smile, she said with this.

Whenever the landlord came to collect, he would instantly switch his mansion into a slum. The mouse pretended to be a blind street performer, begging for money, earning a decent daily income, which made other beggars jealous and often LED them to steal from him. After a busy day, the mouse continued acting as a blind man. On his way home, he would observe his surroundings, making sure no one was following before he dared to open the door. Because inside the room was incredibly luxurious, even with a butler, the mouse entered the dressing room and put on a globally limited edition suit. His greatest hobby every day was opening layer after layer of safes to pull out the stinky socks inside. As he reveled in the joy of counting money, a sharp knock on the door startled him. It was the landlord coming to demand two and a half years of overdue rent. The mouse immediately put the gold back in the safe and bought all the luxury furniture for rickety, broken pieces. Once everything was ready, he acted poor, claiming he hadn't eaten in three days and even asking the landlord for a little money. The landlord, seeing the dilapidated state of the house, believed him. The landlord pulled out the Bill. The mouse noticed a gold coin on the table and quickly hit it. As the house started calculating the charges, the mouse sat down. On a stool which suddenly rotated 360 degrees, the landlord panicked and accidentally pressed a switch. Thinking the mouse was up to tricks, he watched in horror as all the furniture malfunctioned and began flipping uncontrollably. Terrified landlord fled the room, only to run into a black cat outside. The landlord ran away immediately and the black cat, holding a gold coin in its mouth, tricked the mouse. Unaware, the mouse fell for it, and just like that, he became the black cat's dinner.
