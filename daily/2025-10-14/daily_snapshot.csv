I was in eighth grade when Kyle, the new kid, started passing out these fancy birthday invitations. They had gold, glitter and said VIP guest in big letters. Kyle was always bragging about how his dad owned five restaurants and his mom was a model. He said they lived in this huge mansion with a pool that had a diving board and a water slide. Everyone in class was losing their minds over this party. Kyle made it sound like it was gonna be the event of the year. He handed me an invite, too. Even though we barely talked. I felt pretty special since all the popular kids were going. The invitation said Saturday at three PM. Kyle had written the address by hand in messy letters. I'd never been to that part of town before, but my mom agreed to drive me, even though she was working crazy overtime that week. We pulled up to the address right on time, but something was totally wrong. There were no decorations, no. No balloons, no cars parked outside. Just this regular old house that looked kind of run down. The lawn needed cutting, and the paint was peeling. My mom double checked the address. Are you sure this is right, Jordan? I pulled out the glittery invitation. Same street name, same house number. This had to be it. Walked up and rang the doorbell. This older woman answered, looking confused as heck. She had gray hair and was wearing a bathrobe. Can I help you? She asked. Um, hi. I'm here for Kyle's birthday party. He invited me. The woman just stared at me. Kyle? I don't know any Kyle, sweetie. My stomach dropped to my feet. My mom stepped up behind me and asked again, thinking maybe the woman misheard. But she shook her head and said no party was happening at her house. No Kyle lived there either. I felt my face get hot with embarrassment. We apologized and walked back to the car. I

The doctor said she had four months with brain cancer, so when she asked to try cigarettes and wine, I figured why not? She's 16 and dying. Normal rules don't apply. We spent three weeks bonding on the back porch. She'd smoke these little cigarettes I bought her and we'd split a beer while talking about everything she'd never get to do. It was beautiful. In this twisted way, she seemed more relaxed than since the diagnosis. Those evenings became sacred to us. She'd tell me about boys she had crushes on but never got to date. We'd talk about college majors she'd researched but would never pursue. She wanted to study marine biology, said she'd always dreamed of swimming with sharks. The irony wasn't lost on either of us that she was more afraid of living than dying. I watched my wife struggle with what we were doing. She'd see us through the kitchen window and her face would crumble, but she never said anything. How do you argue with a dying kid's last requests? How do you be the parent who says no when time is running out? She started taking longer shifts at work, I think to avoid watching us slowly poisoning ourselves. My daughter started sleeping better. The constant anxiety that had consumed her since the diagnosis seemed to fade. With each cigarette, she'd lean against my shoulder and we'd just sit in comfortable Silence, watching the sunset. I memorized those moments knowing I'd replay them forever after she was gone. She told me things during those sessions that broke my heart, how she felt guilty for being sick, how she worried we'd spend all our savings on treatments that wouldn't work. She was scared of the pain, but more scared of leaving us behind. I held her while she cried, both of us smoking and pretending it was helping. The strangest part was how normal it felt after a few days, like this was just what we did now. Father, daughter bonding over beer and cigarettes because the universe dealt us the worst possible hand. Next morning, Doctor Martinez called while we were having breakfast. She put it on speaker, like always, turning the volume all the way up. He sounded strange, like.

So I went to this Applebee's last Friday night around eight PM I get seated at this booth near the back and my waiter comes over. Guy looked like he was in his early 20s, kind of scrawny with this patchy beard. He takes my drink order, just a Coke, and disappears. For like 15 minutes I'm sitting there looking around, watching other tables get their food and I'm still waiting for my damn soda. Finally, he shows up with my Coke, doesn't even apologize, just flops it down and asks what I want to eat. I order the chicken tenders with honey mustard and seasoned fries. Pretty basic stuff. He writes it down and vanishes again. 20 minutes go by, nothing. I can see him at the computer terminal just standing there scrolling on his phone. Other waiters are running around actually doing their jobs, but this guy is just chilling. I try to get his attention a couple times, but he's completely ignoring my section. After another 10 minutes, I flag down a different waitress, older lady with gray hair who looked like she actually cared about her job. I asked her if she knows what happened to my food order. She looks confused and goes to check. Turns out my waiter never even put my order in the system. The lady, her name tag said Janet, looked embarrassed as hell. She apologizes and immediately puts my order In says the kitchen will rush it. But now I've been sitting there for almost an hour with nothing but a warm Coke. My food finally comes out, but guess who brings it? Not my original waiter. Janet brings it over with another apology. The chicken tenders are overcooked and the fries are cold. At this point, I'm just hungry and tired, so I eat it anyway. The whole time I'm eating, I can see my waiter at the bar area talking to some girl who's clearly not working there. He's completely forgotten I exist. Never checked on me once after taking my drink order, never refilled my Coke, never even walked past my table. When I'm done eating, I have to wave down Janet again to get my check. He brings it over and I can tell she feels bad about the whole situation. The total was like 18 bucks. Here's where it gets interesting. Janet hands me the check and quietly says, don't worry about tipping Tommy. He didn't earn it tonight and everyone saw what happened. Apparently, this wasn't the first time this kid had pulled this crap. So I pay my $18 cash exact change and leave zero tip as I'm walking.

My roommate Kate has this incredible superpower of she can selectively forget her wallet every single time we go somewhere that cost money. But somehow she never forgets it when she's going shopping alone or getting her nails done. We've been living together for eight months and I've been keeping track. She's forgotten her wallet 17 times. 17. And every single time she gives me this look like I'm supposed to cover her because I have a corporate job and she's a freelance artist. Last Tuesday, she comes bouncing into our apartment with this huge grin. Guess what? I booked us a table at Meridian for my birthday dinner Friday night. I invited Jessica, Mike and L too. Meridian, the place where appetizers start at $35, knew exactly what was coming. This was going to be her biggest scam yet. Order expensive food for everyone on her special day, then conveniently forget her wallet and guilt everyone else into splitting the massive Bill. Friday night arrives, she's getting ready, humming some Taylor Swift song, completely in her element. I'm watching from my doorway as she does her usual routine. Phone, check. Keys, check. Lipstick, check. Tiny purse, check. She even did that fake little gasp and snap, like got everything, as if to seal the performance. But there it was, her wallet sitting in plain sight on the nightstand, once again, mysteriously excluded from the essentials. It was like watching Someone rehearse a scam she's pulled off a dozen times. Wallet sitting on nightstand, ignored. I'm just going to touch up my mascara real quick. She calls out, heading to the bathroom. That's when I made my move. I slipped into her room and grabbed the wallet. Black leather, kind of heavy actually. I could feel credit cards and cash inside. We meet everyone at the restaurant. Meridian has this whole upscale vibe, dim lighting, fancy cloth napkins, waiters and actual uniforms. Kate is in full birthday girl mode, telling everyone to order whatever they want. It's my special day. Go crazy. Jessica orders a 40 dollar salmon. Mike gets the 55 dollar steak. L goes for the lamb, which is like 60 dollars. Kate orders the Seafood Tower for herself. Eighty five dollars. We're laughing, having a good time, taking birthday photos. Kate is being the perfect hostess. Then the check comes, $230. Kate looks at it and starts patting down her tiny purse, checking her jacket pockets, looking under the table. Oh my god, you guys, I am so embarrassed. I totally forgot my wallet at home. Here we go. Can someone cover me? I'll Venmo every.

The grocery store security footage showed my face hitting the floor. Blood pooled around my head where I cracked it on the tile. When I woke up in the hospital, I immediately threw up blood. You're literally starving to death, the doctor told me. I tried to sit up, but the room spun violently. I need to get back to work. Rent is due tomorrow. She pushed me back down. You're 16 years old and you weigh 80 pounds. Can't be right. When did you last eat a meal? Three days ago, I think. She looked horrified. Where are your parents right now? In the basement, playing their online game, like always. They don't know you're dying? They told me not to bother them unless someone is dead. You almost were dead. Almost doesn't count according to them. She glanced at my chart. You work two jobs and go to school. I work at four in the morning delivering newspapers, then I go to school, then I work at the grocery store until midnight. That it's physically impossible. Red Bull and gas station pills make it possible. You're taking stimulant. I have to pay rent or we get evicted. Your parents don't have jobs? They quit two years ago to become professional gamers. Are they making money from gaming? I laughed. They've made exactly zero dollars. Keep saying fame is coming any day now. How much sleep are you getting? My thoughts kept slipping away like water through my fingers. Three hours on a good night, but usually less. Do you ever feel dizzy or confused? Every single day. But I can push through it. She stared at me in disbelief. Your parents make you work while they stay home gaming all day? They're trying to build their streaming career. They need my support. She examined my arms, which looked like twigs. 40 pounds underweight because you're feeding them instead of yourself. You don't understand. They should be able to follow their dreams after the sacrifices they made for me. My manager, Jimmy, had been sitting in the corner listening. He finally spoke up, looking sick with guilt. I should have said something sooner. This kid has been falling apart for months. He has been seeing things at work that aren't real. The doctor turned to him quickly. What kind of things? Yeah. he was having full conversations with nobody for 20 minutes straight. I felt my face get hot. Sometimes when I'm really tired, I see shadows that aren't there. That's your brain literally shutting down from exhaustion. Jimmy looked broken. And last week I found him unconscious in the freezer. He had been in there for 40 minutes and had blue lips. I was just resting my eyes. You could have died. But I didn't, so it's fine. The doctor checked my blood work again. Your body is failing and you're still defending them? They're my parents. I owe them everything. You don't owe them your life. Without me, they'll be homeless. Without them, you'd be healthy. The doctor called Child Protective Services and a social worker arrived within an hour. They tried calling my parents 23 times before anyone answered. The doctor put them on speaker so the social worker could record everything. I could hear battle sounds and screaming from their game in the background. This better be important because you just made us lose a ranked match. The doctor spoke calmly. This is the hospital calling about your son who collapsed at work. What does that lazy piece of garbage want now? He's in critical condition from severe malnutrition. My dad exploded. Of course. I should have just let him die when he was born instead of wasting 16 years feeding him. Everyone in the room froze. Your son is hospitalized with severe exhaustion and malnutrition. The doctor said carefully. That lazy waste of space better not miss his shift tomorrow or we'll all be homeless. My mom grabbed the phone. Next, he has to give us $800 by tomorrow or I'm selling everything he owns. The doctor's voice got ice cold. Your child's organs are failing from working to support you. Stop making excuses for that pathetic failure because he can't handle it.

I was 17 when I found out about the secret group chat. It happened totally by accident when I was trying to airdrop a funny video to my mom's phone. But when I looked for her device, I saw something called fam real instead of just mom's iPhone. That was weird. So when she left her phone charging in the kitchen later, I checked it out. My stomach dropped when I saw the group members, Mom, Dad, my older brother Jake, my sister Emma, and even Aunt Beth, everyone except me. I scrolled through their messages from that day. They were planning dinner at this new Italian place downtown. Jake had sent a picture of the menu and Emma was joking about how dad always orders the same pasta. Normal family stuff, except I wasn't invited. Then I saw something that made my chest tight. Emma had written, should we tell Natalie about dinner? Mom replied, she'll just complain about the food or say she's too busy. Dad added, let's keep it simple tonight. I kept scrolling back through weeks of messages. There were plans for mini golf, movie nights, even a trip to the zoo, all happening without me. In one conversation, Jake mentioned how they went to see the new Marvel movie. I had asked them about it the next day and they said it was sold out. The worst part was a conversation from Three months ago, Aunt Beth had written, we should probably include Natalie more. Mom's response was, she makes everything awkward. Remember her birthday dinner? Emma chimed in. She complained about the restaurant being too loud the whole time. Jake added, plus, she always has her headphones in. Anyway, my birthday dinner, the one where I wore my favorite dress and actually tried to join their conversations, I thought we had a good time. Apparently, they spent the whole night annoyed with me. I found messages about a family trip to the mountains last winter. They had gone skiing for a whole weekend. When I asked where everyone was, they told me they were visiting grandma. I even texted grandma to see how she was doing, and she seemed confused about why I thought they were there. There were inside jokes I didn't understand, references to things that happened when I wasn't around. Jake had sent a picture of dad wearing Mom's reading glasses and everyone was laughing about it. Emma wrote, classic dad moment, No. 847. I had no idea what that meant. I sat in the dark kitchen reading message after message. They talked about me like I was some annoying neighbour kid, not their daughter and sister. In one thread, they were discussing Christmas plans. Aunt Beth suggested we all go to her cabin, dad wrote. Sounds great, but what about Natalie? Mom replied. We'll figure something out. My hands were shaking as I scrolled to the very Beginning of the chat, it started eight months ago right after my 17th birthday. The first message was from Emma. Finally, we can plan stuff without drama. Jake had replied, best birthday present ever. I heard footsteps coming toward the kitchen. I quickly closed the phone and pretended to get water from the fridge. Mom walked in and smiled at me like nothing was wrong. Hey, sweetie, how was your day? I wanted to scream. I wanted to show her what I found and ask why they hated me so much. Instead, I just said it was fine and went to my room. That night, I lay in bed thinking about every family moment from the past year. All the times they said plans fell through or events were cancelled. All the times they came home laughing about something and stopped when they saw me. All the times I felt left out and thought I was being paranoid. The next morning at breakfast, they were all.

I know that sounds weird coming from a white girl, but hear me out. This whole thing started about three years ago when I was living in Atlanta for my internship. My usual salon back home was, like, four hours away, and I was desperate for a trim because my hair looked like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. My roommate Keisha, was getting ready to head out to her salon and saw me struggling with my massive curls in the bathroom mirror. She just laughed and said, girl, come with me. My stylist will sort you out. I was hesitant because I'd never been to a black salon before, but honestly, my hair was so bad, I would have tried anything. Walking into that salon was like entering a whole different world. The energy was incredible. Everyone was talking, laughing, music playing, kids running around while their moms got their hair done. It felt alive in a way that the quiet, sterile salons I was used to never did. The stylist, Miss Janet, took one look at my hair and shook her head, baby, who's been cutting your hair? Because they need to stop. She started running her fingers through it, asking me about my routine, what products I used, how I dried it. Nobody had ever asked me those questions before. They just wet it, cut it, and send me on my way. Miss Janet spent two hours on my hair. Two hours. He deep conditioned it, trimmed each curl individually, showed me how to scrunch it properly, and sent me home with specific instructions about what products to use and how often to wash it. My hair looked better than it ever had in my entire life. But here's the thing that really got me. She charged me $40. 40. The salon back home charged

The finding out was biblical. I show up to practice Thursday night at the regular time and my three bandmates are sitting in a circle without their instruments like they're about to hold an intervention. Lead singer says, we need to talk about the band's future. Battle of bands is in 10 days and apparently we need to level up our image. That's when I know it's the drummer's girlfriend standing in the corner holding a bass, my bass actually, that I let him borrow last week. She's holding it upside down. Lead singer looks at me, look, you're great and all, but she has the look we need. She's been learning bass for like two months. Two months. I've been carrying this band for three years. But sure, let's get the girl who thinks a bass has six strings. They vote 3 to 1 to replace me right there with me watching like I'm getting voted off a reality show. The guitarist who still can't play an F chord cleanly actually says it's nothing personal. Nobody's looking at the bassist anyway. Might as well have someone pretty back there. Nobody's looking at the bassist. I wrote half our songs. But okay, Brad, tell me more about how music works. The drummer's girlfriend tries to be nice. You can still come to the show if you want to support us, support them. Sure. Let me buy a ticket to watch you play my bass badly. Sounds like a Dream Friday night. I don't argue, don't yell. Just say okay if that's what you all want. The lead singer seems surprised I'm not fighting back. Probably expected tears. Sorry to disappoint. They're already talking about keeping the band name and the set list for battle of bands. Acting like everything's normal. Planning tomorrow's practice like I was never even there. Like I'm already a ghost. Guitarist mentions they'll see me around and I just nod, give them a smile that doesn't reach my eyes, walk out quietly. I can hear them talking about stage positions as the door closes, how she'll look right in the back, how the judges will love having something nice to look at. They think this is over. They think I'm just going to crawl away and cry. That's cute. I'm sitting in my car in the driveway and my brain starts doing math. Tomorrow's practice. They kept saying see you at practice tomorrow to each other. But wait, that's my amp the guitarist uses because his sounds like a dying cat. My mixing board that makes our lead singer not sound like he's through a kazoo. The mic system I bought with birthday money, the cables, the stands, hell even the extension cords are mine. I check the battle of bands registration on my phone. The song list they submitted. Breaking Chains. I wrote that. Midnight Drive wrote that in my bedroom. Phoenix Rising, that's literally about my ex boyfriend. I have the notebooks. With the original lyrics in my handwriting. The van we use for gigs, mine, well, technically my mom's, but she lets me use it. And then it hits me, this is my dad's garage. Dad only lets them practice here because of me. I text him, hey, the band just kicked me out for not being pretty enough. He text back immediately, are you kidding me? They're banned. I'll change the garage code right now. My dad's the best. They kept saying, see you at practice tomorrow. They actually think they're still practicing here tomorrow in my dad's garage with my equipment, playing my songs. The delusion is actually impressive. Next day, five PM, I'm home.

I used to fake sick at least once a month. Nothing dramatic, just your classic ugh, my stomach hurts routine. I'd shuffle into the kitchen, wrap myself in a blanket, throw in a little cough and wait for my mom to sigh and say, fine, but no video games. She always fell for it or maybe she just didn't care enough to argue. This time felt no different. It was a Thursday. I had a math test I wasn't ready for and zero energy to through Mr Danner's 45 minute rant about fractions. So I pulled out the old stomachache move. My mom was already halfway out the door for work, so she just nodded and left. I grabbed a bowl of cereal, flopped onto the couch and turned on some cartoons, already feeling like I'd won. Dad works nights, so he usually sleeps through most of the day and the house stays quiet. But around 10:00, I heard his door open. I muted the TV and listened. He walked past the living room without noticing me, phone in hand, and stepped out into the garage. Didn't think much of it at first. Figured maybe he was calling in sick or trying to get a refund for something. But then I heard his voice through the wall and it wasn't his normal voice. It was quiet, tired, flat. I can't do this anymore, he said. I paused. I tried. I Really tried, but I feel like I don't even know my family anymore. I come home and everything's just cold. I tiptoed down the hall, heart suddenly racing. The garage door was cracked open, just like always, and I crouched beside it. I know this isn't what we wanted, but it's where we are now. He said, every day I feel like I'm just pretend ending, pretending to be fine, pretending to be a good husband, a good dad. My stomach twisted. This time for real. I mean, look at him, he said. He doesn't even like me. He doesn't talk to me unless he wants something. And when he does, it's just one word answers. I don't even know who he is anymore. My throat went dry. I look at him and all I can think is what happened? What did I do wrong? When did he start looking at me like I was a stranger? There was silence then. I know it's awful, but sometimes I wonder if I'd be happier alone, just starting over, somewhere quiet, somewhere nobody knows me. My chest felt like it caved in. I haven't said anything to her yet, he continued. I don't even know if I will, but I can't keep going like this. I'm exhausted. I backed away from the door before I could hear more. I stumbled into the bathroom and locked the door behind me, sat on the edge of the tub and stared at the floor. He Didn't know I was home. He didn't know I was listening. And he definitely didn't know I had just realized something I could never unhear. My dad didn't just feel lost, he felt lost because of me. I stayed in the bathroom for over an hour just trying to breathe. When I finally came out, he was back in his room. I crept into mine, got under the covers and didn't move for the rest of the day. Later that night, he knocked on my door. How's your stomach, he asked. Fine, I mumbled. Need anything? No. He stood there for a second longer, then said, okay, let me know. I said nothing.

I was waiting in line at Starbucks when this kid, maybe 13, ordered a drink so complicated the barista had to write it down. Venti iced skinny hazelnut macchiato, sugar free syrup, extra shot, light ice, no whip, with exactly 2.5 pumps vanilla. One pump caramel coffee at 140 degrees in a venti cup with extra foam below the rim. The barista made it the it took one sip and exploded. This is wrong. It's 142 degrees. I said 140! Are you stupid? His mom stood there nodding. Jaden has a very refined palate. You need to remake it. The barista apologized and started over. Meanwhile, the line grew longer. An elderly man behind me sighed. The kid heard him. Do you have a problem, old man? Maybe go to McDonald's if you can't wait for quality. His mother actually laughed. Aiden, be nice. Not everyone understands coffee like you do. The second drink came out. Kid took a sip and spat it onto the counter. Now it's too cold. And this is three pumps vanilla. Can nobody here count? The manager came over, apologizing profusely. We'll make it again, no charge. No charge! We're not paying for any of this! The mom snapped. This is harassment! While waiting for drink No. 3, the kid knocked over the tip jar accidentally. Coins scattered everywhere. He watched the barista pick them up and smirked. Maybe if You made drinks correctly, you deserve tips. A woman in line called out, that's incredibly rude. The kid's mom world around. Excuse me, don't parent my child. Someone should. The woman muttered. The kid heard and started fake crying. Mom, she's bullying me! I'm just trying to get my drink. His mother immediately pulled out her phone. I'm recording this. This. This woman is harassing my minor child! The manager panicked, offered everyone free drinks to calm things down. The kid instantly stopped crying. I want a free drink card too, for my emotional distress. They gave him one. A twenty five dollar gift card for acting like a monster. The third drink came out. He tasted it, considered, and poured it on the floor. Still wrong. You know what? I'll make it myself since everyone here is incompetent. He tried to walk behind the counter. The manager blocked him. You can't come back here. My dad owns three Starbucks franchises. Yes, I can. His mom nodded. Let him fix your mistakes. The manager, exhausted, said they'd comp the drink, but he couldn't go behind the counter. The kid grabbed a display mug and threw it against the wall. Then make it right. Ceramic shards everywhere. A baby in the corner started crying from the noise. His mother's response, now look what you made him do. He has anger issues when people don't listen. The manager called security. The mom went ballistic. You're calling security on a child? I want Every employee here fired. While she ranted, the kid walked over to the condiment bar and started opening every single milk carton, sugar packet, and napkin dispenser, dumping them on the floor. Oops! He said after each one. So clumsy today. An off duty cop in line finally stepped forward.

I raised my hand as a joke. I helped my mom watch YouTube videos when she was pregnant with my brother. Does that count? The class laughed and I smiled, proud of my quick thinking. But Mister Gonzales wasn't smiling. His face had gone completely white and his hands were shaking as he gripped the edge of his desk. Good. Come with me now. The entire classroom went silent in South Dallas when a teacher used that tone. You didn't ask questions. Everyone stay in your seats. Do not leave this room. If I'm not back in 20 minutes, have someone call 9, 1 1. He was already pulling me toward the door and that's when I noticed the dark stain on his sleeve. Wet. It looked like blood. Mr Gonzales, what's happening? Is someone hurt? I tried to pull my arm free, but his grip was iron tight. I don't think I'm qualified for whatever. You're the only one who raised their hand. He cut me off. That makes you qualified. Outside, his car was already running with the doors open. She said she had until Thursday. He kept muttering while speeding out of the school parking lot. The midwife isn't answering her phone I the door handle, calculating if I could jump out at the next red light. Mr Gonzales, you're scaring me. Should I call my mom? No. He swerved around. A car and I slammed into the window. No one can know. Put your phone away. Turn it off. I'm not turning off my phone, I shouted. But I did anyway. We were going 50 in a 25 zone and Mr Gonzales kept checking his mirrors like someone was following us. Finally, he pulled into a driveway of a small yellow house that definitely wasn't his. Listen to me. He grabbed my shoulders before we got out. They can't know she was here. Do you understand? No matter what happens, they can't know. I don't understand anything. I was practically yelling, now I'm 17. I don't even have my license yet. Marco. He used my name for the first time, his voice desperate. You've kept bigger secrets than this. I know your family. I need that same silence now. He wasn't wrong. I'd already seen two drive bys this year and never said a word to the cops. But this felt different. He shoved a pair of surgical gloves into my hands. Put these on. The front door was unlocked. Inside, we followed the sound of crying to a back bedroom where a woman was curled up on a bare mattress. She looked young, maybe early 20s, with long black hair stuck to her face with sweat. It's too early, she gasped in accented English when she saw us. Then she looked at me and started crying harder. He's just a child. You brought a child. I'm 17, I said. Stupid like that made any difference? I watch Grey's anatomy, if that helps. She switched to Spanish and started begging Mister Gonzales for something I couldn't understand. He pushed me toward her. Check how dilated she is. What? I backed up so fast I knocked over.

Phoebe walked up to me at my grocery store job and said, I need you to pretend to be my abusive ex. I dropped the can of soup I was stocking. Phoebe Kang, valedictorian, going to Harvard in the fall. Perfect grades, perfect life, perfect everything. What the hell was she doing talking to me? My actual ex won't leave me alone, she explained, glancing around nervously. He keeps showing up at my house, my work, everywhere. But he's 6 4 or and on the football team. She pointed to herself. I'm 5 2 and my parents think I should just handle it diplomatically. They don't understand that Austin's not taking no for an answer. So where do I come in? You're bigger than him. If he thinks I'm with someone who could actually fight back, maybe he'll back off. I've seen you loading trucks in the parking lot. You're not exactly small. I look down at myself. Yeah, I was bigger. Worked construction summer since I was 16. Built like my dad before he took off. What's in it for me? I'll help you pass calculus. You're failing, right? I've seen your test scores posted outside Morrison's classroom. She wasn't wrong. I needed that credit to graduate. Mom was already stressed enough without me not walking across that stage. Fine. But we do this my way. What do you mean? We're not pretending you're with some psycho. We're showing him You're with someone who actually respects you. What's the difference? Everything. First time we met up, I told her the plan. I pick you up from school, walk you to your car, hold your hand in the hallways, normal boyfriend stuff, but visible. That's it? That's it. No drama, no threats, just present. Phoebe looked skeptical. Austin's not going to back down from hand holding, trust me. The first two days were weird. Phoebe's friends kept staring at us like I was some zoo animal. Whispers followed us down every hallway. What's she doing with him? Isn't that the kid who works at Save Mart? Phoebe heard it, too. I could see her jaw tighten every time someone made a comment. You don't have to do this, I told her after some girl made a crack about my thrift store jacket. Yes, I do, she said, squeezing my hand tighter. Sure enough, Austin showed up the third day. Massive dude, varsity jacket. Looked pissed as hell. Who's this? He demanded, getting right in Phoebe's face like I wasn't even there. I stepped between them. Calm. No.

So she's concerned that she's been friend zoned by you. I mean, she's got a great personality and I would like to be friends with her. Yeah. But the, I mean, the thing is, Michael, nobody's on dating apps to be friends. Like they're looking for dates. I guess that's true. But like, you know, sometimes you meet someone who you, who you click with on more of a friend level and, you know, you, you don't necessarily wanna date them, but you wanna continue being friends. Like I think men and women can be friends. So, you know. Well, I don't, I don't think there's any possibility of men and women ever being friends, ever. You do not believe that. The bottom line, you just feel like you guys are better off being friends and that's it. Yeah, she's very cute. You know, she's just not quite my type, I would say. Okay. So what's your type then? Uh, I mean, my friends always make fun of me for it. So, um, you know. Make fun of you for it. Yeah. Why they make fun of your type of person you like to date? You know, everybody has their type and I just have A different type than a lot of people. I'm dying to know. Is it an eye patch thing? Oh, God, I love people with eye patches. It's always been my thing. Tell me it's eye patches. Uh, no, not quite. I don't have a thing for pirates. I promise you we won't make fun of you if you tell us what your type is. I can trust you. No, of course you can't. But you should tell us anyway. Yeah. Is it like a physical thing or a personality thing? No, it's, it's physical. Okay. So what is it? Uh, okay. Here's the thing about Kara.

The current curriculum specifically mentions this myth as something to correct. I showed her the screen. That's when she asked me to step into the hallway. The kids watched wide eyed as the door closed behind us. Do you have any idea how hard it is to teach these kids when parents undermine my authority? She pissed. Now they'll question everything I say. I kept my voice calm. Isn't that exactly what we want them to do, question things and learn critical thinking? I've been teaching for 22 years, she snapped. I'm not changing my whole curriculum because some nurse thinks he knows better than our textbooks. That night, Lily asked me if she was in trouble because Missus Wilson kept giving her mean looks all afternoon. I assured her she wasn't. The next day, Missus Wilson announced a pop quiz with questions like, what color is blood inside the body? Lily answered red and got marked wrong. She came home crying with a big red F. I requested a meeting with the principal and brought printouts of medical textbooks, state science standards and Lily's Quiz. Principal Davis listened carefully, then called in Missus Wilson. When confronted with the evidence, Missus Wilson insisted, this is how I've always taught it, Principal Davis asked, but is it correct? After a long pause, Missus Wilson said, it's what the children understand better. I lost it. My daughter is crying. Every morning before school because she's afraid of getting F's for writing down the truth. Two weeks later, the school replaced their 1998 science books. Missus Wilson was required to attend professional development on current scientific standards. On Lily's next report card, Missus Wilson wrote excellent critical thinking skills. But at the parent teacher conference, she wouldn't look me in the eye. And when I signed up to help with the science fair, I noticed my name had been crossed off the volunteer list. Lily still checks with me whenever she learns something new at school. Dad, is this actually true or is it just a missus Wilson truth?

I stared at the message for 30 seconds before my hands started shaking so badly I almost dropped my phone. Marcus, after three years behind bars, he was out and somehow he'd already found me. I moved across the country, changed my last name, deleted every trace of my old life online, but none of it mattered if he had my address. My cousin Tyler followed up immediately. Prison buddy told me Marcus has been planning this for months. Dudes obsessed. You need to run now. The apartment suddenly felt exposed. Every window of potential entry point, every shadow of a place. I grabbed my laptop and started searching for flights out of the city. My cursor hovering over destinations that were far enough away but close enough to drive back if needed. But where could I go that Marcus wouldn't eventually find me? He tracked me down before when I thought I was safe. Three years ago, I got in a restraining order after he broke into my apartment and waited in my bedroom closet for six hours until I came home from work. The look in his eyes when I found him sitting on my bed holding my favorite sweater still haunted my nightmares. He calm, almost gentle as he explained how we belong together and how I'd understand eventually if I just stopped fighting what was meant to be. The police had Arrested him that night. But Marcus had violated the restraining order 17 times in the following months, showing up at my job, following me to the grocery store, leaving gifts on my car windshield with notes about how patient he could be. The final incident happened when I was having dinner with friends at a restaurant downtown. Marcus had somehow gotten a job as a delivery driver just so he could walk into the restaurant and approach our table. He'd knelt down beside my chair and proposed with a ring he'd made from braided prison commissary bags, speaking loudly enough for the entire restaurant to hear about how our love had survived his temporary absence. The other diners had thought it was romantic until they saw my face. Friend Rebecca had called 9, 1 1 while Marcus continued his speech about destiny and soulmates. When the police arrived, he'd calmly handed over the ring and told them he understood I needed more time to process my feelings. That was the incident that finally got him three years in state prison for stalking and violating a protective order. Three years that I'd used to build a new life in Seattle, thinking distance and time would keep me safe. I called Tyler back immediately. How did he get my address? I don't know all the details. But his cellmate said Marcus spent whole three years were searching. You had photos printed from your social media before you deleted everything, knew about your Job, your apartment, even your favourite coffee shop. My stomach dropped. What photos? I deleted everything before I moved. Old screenshots, cash pages, stuff friends posted and tagged you in. He had this whole system of keeping track. His cellmate thought it was romantic at first until Marcus started talking about how you were just confused and needed to be reminded of what you meant to each other. I looked around my studio apartment, really seeing it for the first time as Marcus would see it. Ground floor with windows facing the parking lot. No security system, just a chain lock and a dead bolt that anyone with basic tools could defeat. One exit through the front door, no back way out. I'd chosen it because it was affordable and close to work, never thinking about defensibility. Tyler, I need you to do something for me. Call Detective Walsh at Seattle PD. And tell her Marcus Wright was released from Milhaven Correctional and has made threats. Tell her I need to deactivate my case file. Already did that. She's on her way to your place now. Relief flooded through me. Detective Walsh had handled my original case before I moved and she'd been the one to suggest I relocate when Marcus's behavior escalated. She understood how dangerous he was and wouldn't dismiss this as paranoia. Twenty minutes later, Detective Walsh knocked on my door with a uniformed officer beside her. I recognized her immediately. Tyler filled me in. She said Without preamble, we're treating this as an active threat. How long ago did you get the warning? About an hour ago. She nodded and pulled out her phone. I'm calling this into the task force. Marcus Wright is considered high risk and his release should have triggered automatic notification to victims. Someone dropped the ball on protocol. The uniformed officer started walking around my apartment, checking windows and door locks while Detective Walsh interviewed me. She wanted to know about any contact I'd had with Marcus or his associates, any suspicious activity around my building, any feeling that I was being watched. I told her about the weird phone calls I've been getting for the past week. Some one would call, I'd answer, and then they'd hang up without saying anything. I'd assumed it was telemarketers or wrong numbers, but now it felt sinister. Those calls started exactly seven days ago, I said. Checking my phone log, always from different numbers, always during the day when I'd normally be at work. Detective Walsh made notes while the uniformed officer.

Uncle Tommy walked through the door and immediately came over to where I was practicing piano. Still wasting your parents money on those piano lessons? He said. Hey, everyone, listen to this. It's sounds like someone's torturing a bunch of sick geese while they're trying to sing the national anthem. Oh, wait, that's just my nephew playing piano. Everyone laughed nervously, and I turned around on the bench. Uncle Tommy, that's really mean. I've been practicing for months. Could you please stop? He rolled his eyes at me. Don't be such a baby. It's just a joke. If you can't laugh at yourself, you'll never make it in life, kiddo. Then he walked over to my cousin Kim, who just got engaged last month. Hey, everyone, wanna start a betting pool? He was grinning. I give this marriage six months, tops. We all know how desperate Kim was to find anyone who would marry her. Kim's face went bright red, and her fiance looked like he wanted to leave right then. Uncle Tommy kept going, pointing at my sister. Speaking of desperation, here's our family teacher. You know what's funny about teachers? They get paid in crayon drawings and apple juice because that's all they're worth. He laughed at his own joke. At least the kids in your class have someone at their level to relate to, right? My sister ran out of the room. My Grandpa laughed. You kids really are too sensitive. Tommy's just joking around. My aunt nodded and added, it's just his sense of humor. You all need to learn to take a joke. By the time dinner was over, Kim had left early and my sister wouldn't come out of her room. At Christmas, I came ready with my own jokes about Uncle Tommy's life. He walked in wearing another expensive suit, and I announced to everyone, hey, look, everyone! Uncle Tommy wore his fancy suit! You know, the one he bought before his third wife took everything, including his house and his last bit of self respect. His eye twitched, but he laughed it off. During dinner, when he grabbed his fourth beer, I said loud enough for everyone to hear, hey, Uncle Tommy, tell everyone that funny story about when you got so drunk at your son's graduation you tried to give a speech and ended up barfing on the principal's shoes. That was hilarious, right? Your son still won't talk to you, but at least you got a funny story out of it. My mom covered her mouth trying not to laugh, and my dad had to look away. At New Year's, when he tried to make a toast, I jumped up. First, let me tell a joke first. What do you call a guy who's been divorced three times, lost every business he started, and still gives relationship and financial advice? Uncle Tommy. Get it? Because it's funny. How he thinks anyone should listen to him. Uncle Tommy finally lost it. You think you're so funny, don't you? He screamed at me while spit flew out of his mouth, making jokes about my divorces and my mistakes like you're some kind of comedian. It's not funny. It's just mean and disrespectful. I smiled at him, real calm. But, Uncle Tommy, you said, if we can't laugh at ourselves, we'll never make it in life. I'm just helping you laugh at yourself. Why is it suddenly not funny when the jokes are about you? The whole room went dead silent, and Uncle Tommy's face looked like it might explode. Remember when you made my sister cry about her weight at her graduation? I kept going. Or that super funny bit where you told Kim's kids their dad was too stupid to get a real job?

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I'd gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or asked if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler who said she was being a total bitch. But I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my fitness pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee With extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better. And she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

I've been keeping this notebook for six years and my girlfriend had no clue until last week. She always said I never opened up emotionally. But honestly, I just thought guys weren't supposed to talk about all the little things they notice. Growing up, my dad forgot everyone's birthday. My mom couldn't remember who liked what food. Their fights were brutal because nobody paid attention to anyone. I swore I'd never be that type of boyfriend. So in college, I started writing stuff down about whoever I was dating. Not weird stalker stuff, just normal things like how Ashley preferred hot chocolate when it rained but iced coffee when it was sunny. Or how Jessica's voice got higher when she was nervous about something. When I met Mia three years ago, the notebook got way more detailed. I wrote down everything, how she stirred her cereal exactly seven times before eating it, how she hummed the same tune when she was happy, how her left eyebrow twitched right before she'd start laughing at something. Every few weeks, I'd add new stuff, like how she only wore her lucky socks on job interview days or how she needed exactly eight minutes of silence when she got home from work before she could handle talking. I wrote down that she liked her apartment at exactly 72 degrees, not 71 or 73, that she always ordered extra pickles but never ate them, that she got cranky If she didn't eat something by 11:00am but never admitted she was hungry, the notebook helped me figure out when to give her space and when to push her to talk about stuff, when to play upbeat music and when she needed something sad. I knew she was stressed when she started reorganizing her bookshelf, so I'd order her favorite Thai food before she even realized she was hungry. When she was upset, she'd clean the bathroom obsessively so I'd run her a bath afterward. None of this felt calculated or weird to me. It just seemed like paying attention. But I never told her about it because it sounded super intense. When I thought about explaining it, like, hey, hey, babe, I've been documenting your behavior patterns for 3 years. Doesn't exactly sound romantic. Plus, guys don't really talk about this stuff with each other. I figured she'd think I was some kind of control freak or something. Last Tuesday, she was cleaning our home office while I was at work. She called me freaking out, asking why I had a notebook with her name on it hidden behind my desk. Panicked, thinking she'd found something embarrassing. But she said she hadn't opened it yet. She was waiting for me to get home to explain. The drive home felt like forever. I kept imagining her thinking I was documenting her flaws or planning to break up with her or something crazy. When I got there, she was sitting on The

I always had this weird feeling about my Uncle Pete. Like, everyone in my family absolutely loved the guy. He was the fun uncle. You know, the one who'd show up to family barbecues with his loud laugh and those expensive gifts that made all us kids go crazy. He take us out for burgers, let us play games on his phone for hours. And somehow he always knew all the latest slang before we did. But something about Pete just felt off to me. Maybe it was how he'd always squeeze into your personal space when he talked to you, standing way too close. Or how he always wanted to be alone with one of us kids, saying stuff like, let the grown UPS talk and pulling us into another room. My parents thought it was sweet that he wanted to spend time with us. I was 16 when my little cousin Emily started acting different. Emily was always this bubbly kid who asked a million questions and made everyone laugh with her silly jokes. But suddenly she got quiet. Like, really quiet. She stopped joking around completely. Stopped asking her usual why this and why that questions. When I'd ask her what was wrong, she'd just shrug and say she was tired. That wasn't Emily at all. One Saturday, I was helping my dad clean out the garage. We were sorting through old tools and junk when I saw this spare Key hanging on a little hook. It had a label that said Pete in my dad's handwriting. That made zero sense to me. Pete didn't live with us. He had his own apartment across town. Why would he need a key to our house? I asked my dad about it. He just chuckled and said Pete probably made a copy years ago when they used to share tools back and forth. You know how your uncle is always borrowing something dad said. But something about that explanation felt wrong. Pete hadn't borrowed tools in years. That night I couldn't sleep. Something about that key kept bugging me. Why would Pete still need access to our house? Why was the key hanging in the garage where everyone could see it? The more I thought about it, the weirder it seemed. The next day, I decided to fake being sick and stay home from school. I told my mom I had a headache and she believed me. After everyone left for work and school, I just waited. I had this gut feeling that something was going to happen. Around two forty five PM, right before Emily usually walked home from school and stopped by our house to wait for her mom to pick her up, I heard the garage door open, but nobody was supposed to be home. I looked out the window and saw Pete's blue Honda pulling into our driveway. My heart started pounding. Pete walked straight into the garage. Like he owned the place. Grab that key and let himself into the house through the side door. He didn't even knock or call out to see if anyone was home. He just walked right in. I followed him from upstairs, trying to be as quiet as possible. He went straight to the downstairs guest room, where Emily usually waited. When she came over, Pete looked around. Then

The call came through my commanding officer. Your son committed felony assault at his father's wedding. You need to get home now. I was on a base in Germany and hadn't seen my boys in 8 months. Now my teenage son who stopped wrestling because he hated hurting people was facing charges for brutalizing a woman at the altar. After an 18 hour emergency flight, I, I headed to my ex husband's house where my son was. The wife's dark blood was still stained by the driveway. I rang the doorbell. My ex husband Conrad answered. His face twisted with rage. We're pressing charges. I'm not taking anyone's side until I see both, I said. Pushing past him. The living room was a tribunal. Conrad's parents on the couch, his brother Potter by the fireplace, his sister Fen in the corner, the bride's parents standing like guard dogs. And in the center the bride Lauren with a splinted nose, two black eyes, bandages across her face. She was crying, dabbing her eyes carefully around the swelling. And there surrounded by this mob sat my son, my fourteen year old who refused to kill insects because he could have been born an ant who taught his little stepbrother origami. He sat perfectly straight, chin raised, looking me dead in the eyes with zero regret. He looked proud of what he did. Your son destroyed our family, Conrad spat. Look what he did to her face. Lauren sobbed harder. He's an animal. They're trying him as an adult, right? Grandpa shook his head in disgust. I looked at my son. His knuckles were still bruised and swollen. There seemed to be no real excuse. But then I asked for his side of the story. He looked around the room, slowly taking in every face. Then he spoke. Voice clear. You wanna know the truth? She's been molesting me for six months. That's why I did it. My world stopped, but the room exploded instantly. Liar, disgusting. How dare you. Lauren's face shifted for just a second before she wailed louder. He's making it up. I've been nothing but loving. Her mother stepped forward, pointing at my son. You evil little. But her father grabbed her arm, his face pale like he'd been expecting this. In the midst of all the chaos, my son pulled out his phone and swiped to his hidden photos, she said. Fourteen year old boys always want it said. I should be grateful. I saw the images over his shoulder and my stomach turned. Conrad's hands were shaking as he stared at the screen. Those could be anyone could have, but his voice was hollow like he was reading a script. He didn't believe Lauren tried to snatch the phone. Those are out of context. I, it was just she stopped realizing. She just admitted they were real. My son stood up, voice shaking with rage. Dad, I told you three months ago, you said she's just being affectionate. Conrad started stuttering. I didn't. I thought, Grandpa, you laughed. Lucky boy. Wish I had that problem at 14. Grandpa's face went from red to white. He looked at Lauren, then at his grandson, and something crumbled in his expression. Aunt Fenn, you told me, don't be dramatic. Fenn was backing toward the door, tears streaming. Oh, god. Oh, god. I thought you were just Uncle Potter. You said I should be grateful Potter had his head in his hands. Jesus Christ. I was joking. I didn't know she was actually grandma. You said boys can't be great by women. Grandma collapsed into the couch, rosary beads in her hands, whispering prayers. Every single one of you told me to shut up about it. Lauren's parents were having a whispered argument. Her father hissed. Not again, Patricia. You said she was better. The word again hung in the air. But that's not why I hit her. My son cut through. Everyone immediately froze. What do you.

My family discovered I was good with kids when I was 14 and babysat my cousin once. That single afternoon of watching cartoons turned me into their unpaid nanny for the next 12 years. At first, it was just by my sister dropping off her toddler just for an hour while she ran errands. That hour turned into six when she decided to get her nails done instead. I remember sitting on my floor surrounded by broken crayons and goldfish crackers, realizing I'd missed my shift at the coffee shop. My brother joined in with midnight text about his twins needing an emergency sitter for his concert plans. College, they took it even further. My sister would bang on my dorm door and dump her kids for entire weekends. She cost me my first serious boyfriend when she called me during our anniversary dinner screaming about a fake emergency. My boyfriend looked at me across that candlelit table and said he couldn't do this anymore. After graduation, my parents made everything worse by secretly giving my siblings keys to my apartment. I started coming home from my marketing job to find kids destroying my kitchen and toys, taking over my home office. My boss pulled me aside after I'd missed another presentation and told me to figure out my priorities. The moment they took it too far came three months ago when I Woke up to voices in my living room. I stumbled out of my pajamas to find four kids watching cartoons with suitcases next to them. My sister's two kids and my brother's twins were all there eating my cereal like it was just another Saturday. On my counter was a note that made my hand shake. My entire family had booked a month long cruise to Europe and decided not to tell me because I'd make it difficult. Note said they knew I take good care of the kids like I always do. I kept reading it over and over, trying to understand how they could just leave the country without even asking me. My sister had attached a grocery list and my brother left $200 for expenses. Like I was their personal hired help. They could book without notice. The youngest kid looked up and asked if I was making pancakes for breakfast. An innocent question broke something inside me because these kids had no idea their parents had just abandoned them. That's when I decided to teach them what abandonment really felt like. You see, 12 years of forced babysitting had taught me every rule about child welfare and what authorities look for. I made the kids breakfast and told them we were going to play a game where they told me about all the times they'd stayed with me before. I recorded videos on my phone as they excitedly shared stories about being dropped off for days. Without their parents checking in. The seven year old even mentioned the time his mom left him here when he had strep throat. I carefully documented the suitcases, the note, and the pathetic $200 meant to last a month. Then I looked up the number for Child Protective Services. My family thought they were getting a free month in Europe. Instead, they were about to learn what happens when you abandon your children with someone who knows the system. I called CPS and reported four abandoned minors with no guardianship papers. The caseworker arrived within two hours and went pale reading the note. By afternoon, the kids were in emergency.

The bride stopped mid pose, her photographer looked confused, and about 30 wedding guests turned to stare at my three year old daughter, Emma, standing by the playground swings. I was mortified. Emma had this habit of saying random things loudly at the worst possible moments, but this was next level embarrassing. Emma, honey, let's go play on the slides, I whispered, trying to drag her away from the wedding party, but she wasn't having it. She broke free from my grip and marched right up to the bride, tugging on her dress. Lady, don't marry the mean man, Emma said, pointing directly at the groom. He's gonna hurt you. Everyone went dead silent. The groom's face went red and he started walking toward us looking angry. Hey, what kind of kids says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just three and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve. My mommy had marks like that. When the bad man lived with us, she cried at night, too. Just like you smell like tears under your makeup. My heart stopped. This kid had been through way too much for her age, but she developed This weird ability to spot things adults tried to hide. When my ex was still around, Emma would always know when I'd been crying, even if I thought I'd covered it up perfectly.

Call your mom right now. I looked up, confused because Mr Bax never talked to individual kids unless someone was throwing things or starting fights. He'd been driving Route 47 for like 10 years and barely acknowledged any of us existed. Why? I pulled out my earbuds and walked closer to the front. His knuckles were white from gripping the steering wheel so hard. Just call her right now. His voice had this urgent edge that made my stomach flip. I fumbled for my phone while other kids started complaining about why we weren't moving. We were stopped three blocks before my usual stop on Cedar Lane. Just sitting there with the engine idling. My mom's phone went straight to voicemail. I tried again. Same thing. She's not answering. Mr Bax was staring at something in his side mirror. And when I turned to look, I saw a black sedan that had been following us for the last few turns. Try your dad or anyone else in your family now. I was really freaking out because, but drivers don't care about your family unless something is seriously wrong. I called my dad and got voicemail again. The black car was still there, just sitting behind us with its engine running through the tinted windows, I could see the outline of someone in the driver's seat. Mr Bax, what's going on? My voice Came out higher than I meant it to. He reached for his radio and spoke quietly into it. Base, this is bus 47. I need immediate assistance at Cedar and 5th. Possible situation with suspicious vehicle following my route. The dispatcher's voice crackled back, asking for details, but Mr Bax kept his responses vague. The other kids on the bus were getting restless and starting to ask questions. Ace from the back yelled, Yo, why aren't we moving? I got practice. Mr Bax ignored him and kept watching that black car in his mirror. Kip, I need you to listen very carefully when I tell you. I want you to duck down below the window level and stay there until I say it's safe. My heart started pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. Are we in danger? I whispered. But before he could answer, sir, the black sedan pulled up alongside our bus. The windows were so dark I couldn't see inside, but I felt like someone was staring right at me. Mister Bax's hand moved to something under his dashboard that looked like a panic button. Everyone sit down and be quiet, he announced to the whole bus in his serious voice. The car kept pace with us as we started moving again. Staying right next to my window, I pressed myself against the seat, trying to make myself smaller. Other kids were craning their necks to see what was happening, but something about the Whole situation felt wrong in a way I couldn't explain. My phone finally rang and it was my mom, but she sounded weird, really weird. Tip, honey, where are you right now? Her voice was shaky like she'd been crying. I'm on the bus. We're running late because she cut me off. Listen to me very carefully. Do not come home today. Go to Aunt Pip's house instead. I'll pick you up there later. In the background, I could hear men's voices talking, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. Mom, what's wrong? Why can't I come home? The line went quiet for a few seconds. Then she whispered, just trust me, baby, don't come to the house. Paul ended abruptly, leaving me staring at my phone in panic. Mr Bax was watching me in the rearview mirror. What did she say? I told him about going to my aunt's house instead. And his face got this grim expression. The black car was still following us and now there was a second one behind it. Change of plans, kid. We're going straight to the police station. He made a sharp turn away from.

I need extra hands. Yeah, I don't think so. I wasn't about to climb into a bathroom stall with a freak. No, please. I think I might bleed out. Her voice was shaking. And suddenly this wasn't funny anymore. It was summer from my English class, a pregnant senior who everyone whispered about but nobody really talked to. She was sitting on the toilet, gripping the handicap rail with white knuckles, and her face was covered in sweat. What's wrong? I asked, even though I was starting to guess. Please do something. I'm giving birth. She looked up at me with pure terror in her eyes. My whole body went cold. I was 17 and barely knew how tampons worked, let alone babies. But she was crying and alone, and I couldn't just leave her there. I hopped over the stall divider awkwardly and almost slipped on the wet floor. That's when I saw it. The baby was already crowning. There was blood on the toilet seat and the floor, and summer was making these low groaning sounds that scared me more than anything. This was actually happening in a gross school bathroom with fluorescent lights and graffiti on the walls. I'll be right back. I ran out of the bathroom. Still in shock. I sprinted down the hallway to Missus Bishar's classroom. She was my favourite teacher and The only adult I could think of who wouldn't freak out, I burst through her door, interrupting her lecture on photosynthesis. The whole class stared at me. I need your help urgently, please. I was out of breath and probably looked insane. Missus Bashar took one look at my face and followed me without asking questions. We ran back to the bathroom and I could hear summer sounds getting louder. Other kids were starting to peek out of classrooms wondering what was happening. Missus Bishar pushed open the stall door and immediately went into teacher mode. Okay, honey, I'm here. You're doing great. I'm going to support you while she gets the nurse. I didn't need to be told twice. I ran to the nurse's office faster than I'd ever run in PE. When I burst through the door, Nurse Patty was checking Casey's temperature. Casey, who everyone knew was Summer's boyfriend, the guy who'd been bragging about becoming a dad at prom. Summer's having her baby in the bathroom right now. I basically screamed it. Casey's face went from white to green. He threw up all over the floor before Nurse Patty could grab a trash can. But we didn't have time to deal with that. Three of us ran back to the bathroom with nurse Patty grabbing emergency supplies from her cabinet. By now, half the school had heard something was happening. Kids were crowding outside the bathroom doors trying to figure out what all the screaming was. About teachers were trying to move them back to class, but nobody was listening. When we got back to the stall, it was chaos. Missus Bashar was holding Summer's hand while she pushed. The nurse immediately took over, checking how dilated she was and telling summer to breathe. Casey stood frozen in the doorway looking like he might pass out. That's when summer grabbed my hand and pulled me close. You have to get.

Girl, when I tell you, I almost fainted when the school called me. I ain't even playing. So it's a regular Thursday. I'm in the middle of target looking for a throw pillow that matches absolutely nothing. And my phone rings. Caller ID says Lincoln Elementary. My stomach drop. I thought, oh, god, did she fall off the monkey bars again? Did she hit someone? Or worse, did she say something? Think she heard me say? So I answer all fake sweet, like, hi, this is her mom. And the lady on the other end says, ma'am, we need you to come in immediately. Your daughter had an incident. Now listen, my daughter Layla is cute, like real cute. Big eyes, big hair, big attitude. She's eight, but she's also part gremlin when she's hungry or bored. So I throw the pillows back, leave the car and speed down to that school like it's the Indie 500. I walk in, heart pounding, and the secretary just points at the principal's office like, yeah, she's in there. I open the door and baby Layla sitting there with her arms crossed like a little mob boss. Principal looking nervous. There's a boy across from her with an ice pack on his head and a teacher looking like she aged 10 years today. I go, Layla, what did you do? She goes, he tried to take my cookie. So I defended myself. Calm like she's In court, the principal sighs and says she hit him with a lunch tray. I blinked. I'm sorry. She what? Now the teacher jumps in. She told the boy, touch it and you lose a finger. We thought she was joking. Next thing we know, he grabs her cookie and boom, metal tray to the forehead. I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing because I know where she got that line, me. She got it from me. I said that last week about my fries at Chili's. But I clear my throat and say, Layla, you can't go around hitting people. He goes, he tried to rob me. What was I supposed to do care? Like it's a fairy tale. That cookie had my name on it in Sharpie. I wrote it. Possession is 9/10 of the law, y'all. She hit him with legal terms. The boy starts sniffling like he's the victim here. And Layla leans in and says, you should have asked. Now look at you. I stocked up like leftovers. I had to turn around and pretend to cough so I wouldn't laugh. I'm dying inside. The principal says, we don't condone violence. Layla goes, neither do I, but I condone consequences. I swear, this child is either gonna be a lawyer or in jail. So I take her home, try to give her a serious talk. I go, he can't be violent, even if you're right. There's rules. She goes, Exactly. Rule No. 1, don't touch my food. I said, Layla, I'm serious. She goes, okay, okay. Next time I'll use words. Maybe. Probably. And then y'all ready for the kicker? That night, I get a text from the mom of the boy. I'm bracing myself.

The call came through my commanding officer. Your son committed felony assault at his father's wedding. You need to get home now. I was on a base in Germany and hadn't seen my boys in 8 months. Now my teenage son who stopped wrestling because he hated hurting people was facing charges for brutalizing a woman at the altar. After an 18 hour emergency flight, I, I headed to my ex husband's house where my son was. The wife's dark blood was still stained by the driveway. I rang the doorbell. My ex husband Conrad answered. His face twisted with rage. We're pressing charges. I'm not taking anyone's side until I see both, I said. Pushing past him. The living room was a tribunal. Conrad's parents on the couch, his brother Potter by the fireplace, his sister Fenn in the corner, the bride's parents standing like guard dogs. And in the center the bride Lauren with a splinted nose, two black eyes, bandages across her face. She he was crying, dabbing her eyes carefully around the swelling. And there surrounded by this mob sat my son, my 14 year old who refused to kill insects because he could have been born an ant, who taught his little stepbrother origami. He sat perfectly straight, chin raised, looking me dead in the eyes with zero regret. He looked proud of what he Did your son destroyed our family, Conrad spat. Look what he did to her face. Lauren sobbed harder. He's an animal. They're trying him as an adult, right? Grandpa shook his head in disgust. I looked at my son. His knuckles were still bruised and swollen. There seemed to be no real excuse. But then I asked for his side of the story. He looked around the room slowly taking in every face. Then he spoke. Voice clear. You wanna know the truth? She's been molesting me for 6 months. That's why I did it. My world stopped, but the room exploded instantly. Liar. Disgusting. How dare you. Lauren's face shifted for just a sec and before she wailed louder. He's making it up. I've been nothing but loving. Her mother stepped forward pointing at my son. You evil little. But her father grabbed her arm, his face pale like he'd been expecting this. In the midst of all the chaos, my son pulled out his phone and swiped to his hidden photos, she said. Fourteen year old boys always want it said. I should be grateful. I saw the images over his shoulder and my stomach turned. Conrad's hands were shaking as he stared at the screen. Those could be anyone could have, but his voice was hollow like he was reading a script. He didn't believe Lauren tried to snatch the phone. Those are out of context. I, it was just she stopped realizing. She just admitted they Were real. My son stood up, voice shaking with rage. Dad, I told you three months ago, you said she's just being affectionate. Conrad started stuttering. I didn't. I thought, Grandpa, you laughed. Lucky boy. Wish I had that problem at 14. Grandpa's face went from red to white. He looked at Lauren, then at his grandson, and something crumbled in his expression. Aunt Fenn, you told me, don't be dramatic. Fenn was backing toward the door, tears streaming. Oh, god. Oh, god. I thought you were just Uncle Potter. You said I should be grateful Potter had his head in his hands. Jesus Christ. I was joking. I didn't know she was actually grandma. You said boys can't be great by women. Grandma collapsed into the couch, rosary beads in her hands, whispering prayers. Every single one of you told me to shut up about it. Lauren's parents were having a whispered argument. Her father hissed. Not again, Patricia. You said she was better. The word again hung in the air. But that's not why I hit her. My son cut through. Everyone immediately froze. What do you.

Yeah, bro. I just had the worst couple days of my life. What? Why? What happened? You know that new diet I've been on, right? Uh, yeah, I heard that eating fiber helps you lose weight. So I got five boxes of those Fiber one bars. That's all I've been eating. Nothing else, just fiber bars. I couldn't. The day after that I did the same thing. I ate six more boxes of fiber bars, only I didn't that day either. I was getting very worried. I take at least one on a normal day, but I could feel the fat burning off my body from all the fiber. I didn't. The day after that either. I didn't. The fourth day I didn't. Fifth day I didn't. The sixth day, but then I was drinking my morning coffee and I started hearing the loudest rumble I've ever heard. I thought it was an earthquake or volcano exploding, but no, it was my stomach. I rushed to the toilet. The moment my ass hits the toilet, the loudest and most funkiest fart comes out of my. Took 8 seconds for the fart to finish. My mom rushed to the bathroom door. She thought something happened to me. Then it stops. A brick starts to come out and it's so solid that I feel like I'm giving birth to Megamind out of my ass. I hung on to the shower curtain and I prayed. I ripped the Whole shower curtain out of the wall. Then the brick finally came out. At speeds faster than a F1 racing car, the entire bathroom was soaking in toilet water. That's just the start. A fart that could do more damage than a nuclear missile starts a barrage of bullets from me. After an hour, it seemed to be over. I'm crying at this point and I can barely breathe. I wipe my butt crystal clean. What the actual.

He even attached his resume like we were best buddies. I had to read it three times because I couldn't believe the audacity. This dude, who wouldn't even acknowledge my existence, was now trying to use my name and position to get himself a job at my company. I immediately went to LinkedIn to do some detective work. His profile showed he'd been unemployed for six months. Before that, he'd only lasted 8 months at his previous job. The guy was clearly desperate. My first instinct was to just ignore the email completely, let him figure out on his own that I wasn't gonna help. But the more I thought about it, the more annoyed I got. He was literally trying to use me after making it crystal clear we weren't friends anymore. So I picked up my phone and called our HR director, Janet. I told her the whole story. This guy was someone from my past who'd made it very clear he wanted nothing to do with me, and now he was trying to use my name as a reference without even asking permission first. Janet was shocked. She said that was pretty bold of him and asked if I wanted her to make a note in his file. I said absolutely, but I wasn't done. I also went to talk to Marcus, one of the partners who handles hiring for Tyler's department. I told him the whole story about the divorce, the friend group split, and especially about Tyler's behavior at that charity event. Marcus actually laughed and said he couldn't believe someone would be that clueless. Marcus told me Tyler's application was already pretty weak anyway. His resume had some gaps and his cover letter was generic as hell. But now, knowing he was the type of person to burn bridges and then try to use those same bridges later, that sealed the deal. Tyler never even got a phone screening, let alone an actual interview. His application went straight to the rejection pile. About a week later, I got another email from him asking if I'd gotten his first message and if there was anything else he could provide to help with the reference. The man was still clueless. I finally replied with the shortest message possible. Hi Tyler, I received your email. I won't be able to provide a reference. Best of luck with your job search! He never responded, which was probably for the best.

So about 6 years ago, I went through this messy divorce that basically split our entire friend group down the middle. My ex husband got most of our friends since they were his buddies from college anyway, which sucked, but whatever. I just accepted that I was gonna lose a bunch of people and started over. The worst part was how some of these people acted afterward. Like this one guy, Tyler, who I thought was actually a decent friend. We used to hang out all the time. I'd watch his cats when he went out of town. We did game nights at their place every Friday and I even helped him move twice. This dude knew me for like five years. Right before my divorce was finalized, my ex invited me to this charity gala, the thing he was involved with. He got me a VIP ticket and everything, probably trying to show off or whatever. I figured why not? It was for a good cause and I was trying to be mature about everything. I'm in the V I P area getting my little name tag and gift bag when I bump into Tyler. I gave him a friendly wave and said, hey, expecting at least a normal human interaction. This man literally looked me dead in the eye, then looked me up and down like I was some kind of disease and walked around me. Without saying a single word, not even a nod, just straight up pretended I didn't exist. That hit different. Like I expected some awkwardness, but the complete ice cold treatment from someone who used to text me random memes and borrowed my car message received loud and clear. Fast forward about four years. I'm remarried now, doing really well at my marketing firm. Got promoted to senior director last year. Life's good. Then one random Tuesday morning, I'm drinking my coffee and checking emails when I see this message in my work inbox from guess who? Tyler fucking Henderson. The subject line was long time no see with one of those cringey smiley face emojis. Email started with, hey there, it's been forever since we connected. Hope you and the family are doing amazing. I'm sitting there like, did this man forget he treated me like I had the plague 4 years ago? But it gets better. The next paragraph basically said he'd been job hunting for a while and just applied to our company. Oh, and by the way, he.

His only rule is that I cannot interfere with their trip. Anyways, we were at the airport and I overheard them talking about this star named Bonnie Blue. She also practiced with a couple of guys. I told them that it is a girl's dream for it to happen. We got to Miami and everything started out pretty smooth. I treated myself to a day at the spa and pool. I wanted to keep it light for the first day because we were traveling for a couple of hours. It was time for bed and as I was getting ready I got a text from my hubby. He asked me if I could come to their room to help with something. When I showed up to his room, he said he and his buddies were ready to make my dream come true. I knew what he meant on the spot. I got straight to work. My husband was the first to start. That was his rule. He felt bad for the last guy though. Anyways, he finished and afterwards he stood around cheering his friends on. I guess he was trying to lighten the mood and not make it so awkward after the last guy. When I was completely exhausted, him and his buddies helped me back to my room and made me comfortable. There were six days left in the trip, and every night they would play with me. Definitely a trip to remember. And I could not wait for the next boys trip. Maybe I will invite one of my girls to come with me next time. Stay tuned for part two.

We had the weirdest rule in probably the entire state. No closed doors while changing clothes. Ever. Not my bedroom door, not the bathroom, not even the closet. Teenagers hide tattoos all over their body if we let them, dad would say. Or they could be hiding pills in their pockets. My friends were horrified when they heard about it. Mickey came over once and watched me change from school clothes to normal, normal ones. Right in the middle of our living room while dad sat there with his newspaper, glancing up every few seconds. That's so creepy, she whispered, and I wanted to disappear. My older brother had already escaped to college, partly because of rules like this. I counted days until I could leave, too. Mom tried to help without directly challenging dad. She couldn't change his mind about the rule, but she found ways around it. The shower has frosted glass. Mentioned one day while folding towels. You're only visible as a shadow. She also helped me rearrange my room, putting my full length mirror at an angle where it looked like you could see everything from the doorway, but there was actually a blind spot. Perfect for 30 second wardrobe changes. I got really good at it, too. I kept spare clothes in the bathroom and changed when dad was busy watching TV. Mom would create distractions, calling dad to fix something right when I Needed to change for school. For weeks, this worked perfectly. Dad thought he was enforcing his rules since door stayed open. He even bragged to his co workers about how his visibility system kept me safe. But then one weekend, everything exploded in ways I never imagined. Dad's colleague Rob came by to drop off work files. Dad was on a video call in his office. Mom was grocery shopping, and I just gotten home from track with my entire body sweating. I couldn't wait for Dad's call to end, so I ducked behind my mirror. Blind spot, like always. But Rob didn't know our house layout. He was looking for Dad's office and saw what looked completely wrong from his angle. A teenage girl hiding behind furniture to undress. He looked away immediately, but asked me a question that sounded oddly serious. Where's your father? I pointed to Dad's office, and he took off through the door. I heard him say, Jim, your daughter was hiding behind furniture to change clothes. Combined with these visibility rules you mentioned. Dad came out confused at first. She knows the rules about doors. Rob shook his head. Jim, she was hiding behind furniture to change. That is not okay. You're making her feel unsafe. The way

The man who booked your room is watching you from the lobby. I stared at the scribbled message for three seconds before forcing my face to stay neutral. My blood went cold as I pretended to read the Standard Hotel policies. Someone else had booked my room. Impossible! I'd made the reservation myself through the company portal for this business trip to Dubai. I glanced up casually and caught the receptionist's eye. She was a young Filipino woman with nervous energy radiating from her as she processed my fake American passport. Behind her polite smile could see genuine fear. She handed me the key card, along with another small piece of paper folded beneath it. I pocketed both without looking at the second note. Thank you. Behind me I could hear other guests again, but I fought the urge to turn around and scan the lobby. I walked toward the elevators like any normal business traveler. The elevator doors opened and I stepped inside, finally allowing myself to breathe. Only then did I unfold the second note. Room 1427. Use service elevator to get there. Regular elevator is monitored. He has people watching. My hands started shaking. Room 1427? I was supposed to be in 1419. According to my company booking, someone had changed my reservation and was now watching me. But who and why? I was just a software engineer on a routine client. Visit. When the doors opened on the 14th floor, I forced myself to walk normally toward room 1419. I slid the key card and nothing happened. Red light. The card was programmed for room 1427, not 1419. Whoever changed my reservation had planned this carefully. I walked eight doors down to 1427, and the card worked perfectly. Green light. Door opened. The room looked standard, but something felt wrong. The curtains were already closed by being mid afternoon. There was a vanilla envelope on the bed. Someone had been in this room very recently. I set my suitcase down and opened the envelope. Inside were photographs. Eight black and white surveillance photos of me taken over the past three months. Walking into my apartment building in Boston, getting coffee at Logan Airport. At the Dubai airport. Someone had been following me for months. The last photo showed me walking into this hotel lobby 30 minutes ago. At the bottom was a note written in Arabic. Even though I'd been ordered to pretend I couldn't read it, the words burned into my brain. We know who you really are, Agent Khalil. Your cover has been blown for weeks. Cooperate, or your family pays the price. Agent Khalil. My real name was David Hassan, and I was a CIA operative working under deep cover for the past three years. My mission in Dubai was supposed to be simple intelligence gathering on a suspected arms dealer named Rashid al Mansouri. Built my cover. Identity as a software engineer so carefully. But someone had discovered the truth. I sat on the edge of the bed staring at the photos. Three years of work destroyed. Had I slipped up? Or was there a leak inside the agency? My phone buzzed with a text from an unknown number. Balcony. Five minutes. Come alone. I walked to the window and moved the curtain aside. 14 floors below, the pool area was crowded with tourists. My trained eye caught the three men positioned around the pool, who weren't swimming or drinking. They were watching the building, watching for me. I had two choices. Follow the instructions and walk into what was probably a trap. Or try to run and risk whatever they threatened about my family. My sister lived in Phoenix with her two kids. My parents were retired in Florida. All of them thought I was a software engineer. None of them knew about my real job. The balcony door opened easily and I stepped into the Dubai afternoon heat. The man standing there was in his 40s, wearing an expensive suit. He looked like a businessman, but his pop

Don't react to what they're saying about you. I looked up for my beer to see him wiping down the bar, his eyes flicking toward the corner booth where three men sat drinking whiskey. One had a scar running from his eyebrow to his jawline. The other two looked like they lifted cars for fun. I picked up the napkin and read what he'd scribbled in Greek. They think you're FBI planning something bad. Play stupid, forest. My blood went cold. I was FBI, but nobody in this dive bar in Queens was supposed to know that I've been working undercover for six months trying to infiltrate a Greek organized crime family. My cover was supposed to be solid, just another third generation Greek American who'd lost touch with his heritage and didn't speak the language. The bartender moved away and I forced myself to take another sip of beer like nothing had changed. In Greek, the man with the scar said to his friends, we need to handle this tonight. Can't have fed sniffing around, the warehouse boss said, to make it look like a robbery gone wrong. My hand tightened on the beer bottle, but I kept my expression blank. The second man, built like a refrigerator, responded in Greek, how do we know for sure he's FBI? Scarface laughed without humor. Dimitri is never wrong. The guy's been asking too many questions. At the gym about shipping schedules. Plus his background check came back too clean. They were talking about me. I've been going to Olympus Fitness for three months, carefully building relationships. The third man said in Greek, so what's the plan? We grab him when he leaves. Too many witnesses, Scarface replied. We follow him home. Do it there, clean, quiet. I pulled out my phone and typed cover blown. Three hostiles planning to follow me home. Extraction. I hit send and took another casual sip, laughing at something on the TV. My phone buzzed, extraction team, 20 minutes out. Keep playing dumb. Exit through kitchen if you can. The bartender came back in English with a thick accent. He said, you need something else? I shook my head. Actually, can I use your bathroom? He pointed toward the back, through the kitchen, past the storage room. His eyes met mine for just a second. He was giving me an out. I stood up slowly, left cash on the bar and walked toward the back. I mean, I heard Scarface say in Greek, he's moving. Petros, go check that he's actually going to the bathroom and not trying to run. I pushed through the kitchen door. The bathroom door was to the left, but straight ahead was a back exit with an alarm bar. If I ran for it, Petros would know. I headed for the bathroom, single stall, cramped. I counted to 30, listening to Petros's heavy breathing outside. I flushed, washed my hands and opened the door. Petros was blocking the path back. He smiled, all teeth and no warmth. In English, he said, you having good time tonight? Yeah, man. Just watching the game. He studied my face for a long moment. Finally, he stepped aside. You enjoy rest of your night. I walked back through the kitchen. Behind me, I heard Petros speaking into his phone in Greek. He's coming back. Looks clean. We'll take him when he leaves. I slid back onto my bar stool. The bartender caught my eye and gave the tiniest shake of his head. Don't leave yet. The three men in the corner booth were watching me now, not even trying to hide it. Scarface raised his whiskey glass in my direction with a cold smile. My phone buzzed. Extraction team delayed traffic accident 30 more minutes. 30 minutes. I had to stay in this bar with three men planning to kill me for 30 more minutes without showing I understood what they were saying. The bartender brought me a fresh beer on the house. You look like you need it. I had my service weapon in an ankle holster, but if I pulled it here, innocent people could get hurt. The bar was crowded now, filling up with the afterwork crowd. Scarface stood up and walked toward me. Every muscle tensed, but I kept my posture relaxed. He sat down next to me and ordered an Uzo. When the bartender Brought it. Scarface turned to me. You like this place? Yeah, it's good. I gestured at the TV. He smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. You Greek? You look Greek. My grandparents were, but I don't really know much about it. Just American, I guess. Ah, that's too bad. He switched to freak and said to the bartender, another round for my new friend here. Scarface continued in Greek, watching my face. This one's definitely FBI. Look at his posture. Look at how he's sitting with his back to the wall, eyes on the exits. And that's training. I took a drink and laughed at something on TV, giving no indication I understood. The bartender responded in Greek, you sure he seems like a regular guy, Dimitri? Sure. That's enough for me. Scarface drained his Uzo and stood up. In English, he said, you have good night. Be careful.

Despite bringing in $2 million in new business and getting denied a raise three times. This shows you're not committed to our team, he said, demanding I clean out my desk immediately. I thanked him for the opportunity and left. Only Monday would be fun. Lawrence Bennett leaned back in his custom leather chair. Tan from his Miami business trip. Four years at Dryfield Robotics. Four years watching Tyler Davis get promoted over me despite my numbers being double his. Then Tyler took credit for the Westbrook deal I'd spent six months building. Then he got a company car. Meeting invites started missing my inbox. Little comments and meetings. Are you sure that's the right approach? Last month, I closed Abbot manufacturing $2 million, our biggest contract of the year. I flew to Chicago three times on my own dime, worked every weekend, missed my cousin's wedding. When the contract came through, Lawrence took the. Came out for drinks. Everyone except me. I found out from Instagram. That's when I asked about my raise. Third time asking. The timing isn't right, Lawrence said. We're restructuring compensation. That night, I updated my resume for the first time in four years. A week later, Vanessa Mills reached out on LinkedIn. Former dry field client, now at Ravi on publishing. Over coffee, she mentioned they needed someone to head their business development division. Someone like me. I took one Vacation day for an interview. Someone saw me in the ravioli lobby and told Tyler. Now. Lawrence sat across from me, waiting for me to beg. I understand, I said. His eyebrows twitched. You're terminated, effective immediately. Clean out your desk. I stood up and extended my hand. He hesitated before taking it. Thank you for the opportunity. The walk back was quiet. Everyone pretending to be busy, stealing glances. I pulled a cardboard box from the supply room. A coffee mug, some pens, a cactus I'd kept alive for three years. Four years of my life smaller than a microwave. April hovered nearby, watching me like I might steal fill a stapler. I brought in. $2 million. They thought I might steal office supplies. Tyler stepped out as I headed to the elevator. The man who'd assured me my raise was in process. He didn't make eye contact. Turn in your badge at security. In the elevator, I caught my reflection. I didn't look fired. I looked lighter. I sat in my car for an hour, staring at the building where I'd spent four years believing loyalty meant something. My phone buzzed. Text from Tyler. Sorry about how things went down. I deleted it. Then another message. Email from Vanessa. Can you come in tomorrow, 10 a m? The team would like to meet you. I replied, yes. That night, my father said, they did you a favor. They showed you exactly who they are. He was right. The Ravion Interview took 20 minutes. They'd already checked my references, already talked to Abbott, Manu

I stood on the porch with my duffel bag, staring at Claire, the woman I've been married to for eight years. Claire, it's me, David. What are you talking about? She stepped back, gripping the door frame so hard her knuckles went white. David died. I sent his body home. Three months ago, I buried my husband. Her voice was shaking, but there was something else in her eyes. Not relief or joy that I was alive, but fear. Real, genuine fear. My seven year old son, Jake appeared behind her, peeking around her legs. He saw me. His face lit up. Daddy! He tried to run to me, but Claire grabbed his shoulder and pulled him back. Jake, go to your room now. But that's daddy. He came home. Jake was crying now, struggling against her grip. Mommy, why won't you let me hug Daddy? Claire's face went pale. That is not your father. Your father is dead. I, I saw the coffin. Then a man appeared behind her, putting his hand on her shoulder. Tall, maybe 40, wearing jeans and a polo. Like he belonged in my house. Honey, what's wrong? He saw me and his expression hardened. Who the hell are you? My stomach dropped. Who the hell are you? I'm Ryan, Claire's husband. Now, I'm going to ask you one more time. Who are you and what do you want? After hours of police interrogation, And military verification. Lieutenant Colonel Webb from Criminal Investigation Command showed me the evidence someone had faked my death through official channels. A death certificate was filed, a body returned to the United States and buried with full military honors. Webb laid out bank records, emails, text messages between Claire and Ryan dating back over a year while I've been deployed. Messages about insurance policies, about filing death benefit claims, about finding someone who could handle the paperwork. Claire and Ryan have been having an affair for over a year. They hatched a plan to have me declared dead so she could collect my 400,000 dollar life insurance policy and they could be together without the messy divorce. Ryan's brother Michael worked as a supply contractor at Bagram Airfield with access to personal areas. They paid him 50 thousand dollars to steal my personal effects and help create the false death record. The body buried in my grave was an Afghan civilian killed in an actual IED attack, identified through falsified dental records and corrupted DNA samples. The insurance company had paid out $400,000 to Claire within six weeks. She and Ryan had already spent $75,000 on a down payment for a new house, a new car for Ryan, and paying off their debts. They hadn't counted on was me coming home two weeks early due to a rotation change. My early arrival caught them completely off guard. Webb explained that the shock on Claire's face wasn't joy that I was Alive. It was horror that I wasn't dead. The federal charges were extensive. Ryan got 15 years in federal prison. His brother Michael got 12 years. Claire got 10 years with possibility of Parole after seven. The life insurance company sued to recover the $400,000 plus interest and legal fees. House was seized, the car repossessed, bank accounts frozen and empty. Claire was left with over $200,000 in debt she'd be paying off for the rest of her life. I filed for emergency custody of Jake with was granted immediately. When I finally saw him again at the CPS office, he ran to me and wouldn't let go, crying into my chest. I knew it was you. I told Mommy, but she wouldn't listen. Why didn't she listen? The exhumation revealed exactly what investigators suspect. An Afghan civilian male, approximately my age and build, killed in an IED attack. His family in Afghanistan was eventually identified and notified, adding another layer of tragedy to the whole situation. Claire was released on Parole after seven years. When Jake was 15, he agreed to see her once at a

So I did. Three months later, he applied for a job there. I'd been the top architect at Morrison and Cole for six years. Brought in 40% of our clients. Never missed a deadline. Won two industry awards that had the company name on them. Not mine. But every time I suggested we modernize our outdated software or actually listen to clients instead of pushing cookie cutter designs, my boss, Richard would laugh. You're just a designer, Carter. I'm the businessman. That's why I sit in this office and you sit in that cubicle. He said this in front of clients, in meetings. Once at the company Christmas party after three drinks. The worst part? I believed him. I thought maybe I really was just good at drawing pretty buildings and didn't understand the real business side. Breaking point came when I landed the Riverside development project. A two million dollar mixed use complex. Our biggest client in five years. I work 80 hour week for three months. We did the designs four times because the client kept changing their vision. I didn't complain. I made it work. The final presentation was flawless. The client loved it. Richard took full credit there in his $3,000 suit, introduced himself as the lead architect, shook hands like he'd done all the work. I sat in the back of the conference room and said nothing. When I confronted Him privately, after he didn't even look up from his phone. What did you expect, a gold star? My name is on the door, Carter. That means I get the credit. That's how the world works. I told him that wasn't fair, that I deserved recognition for my work. He finally looked at me. Smile. If you think you can do it, better start your own firm. Oh, wait. You don't have the balls or the brains for that. I quit the next morning. Cleaned out my desk before anyone arrived. Left my key card on his desk with a sticky note that just said, thanks for the motivation. I emptied my savings account. $47,000. Everything I had. Rented the cheapest office space I could find. 400 square foot room above a nail salon. My desk was from IKEA. My chair squeak, but it was mine. I called every client I'd ever worked with, the ones who actually knew my name, who'd asked for me specifically on projects, who'd sent thank you emails that Richard never forwarded to me. Turns out they've been waiting for this. Finally, one of them said, always hated dealing with Richard. We only stayed because of you. My first project was a small residential redesign. $15,000. I cried when they signed the contract. By week six, I had four active projects. By week eight, I hired my first employee, Jessica, a recent grad who reminded me of myself six years ago. Talented, hungry.

Mom's eating breakfast scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading life 3 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work part time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest. She says if we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear. Which sounds like something a dictator would say, but whatever. She makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realise immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3 60 doesn't just show where you are. It shows your speed when driving, your phone battery, and sends notifications for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect! Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she's shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is. Men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realise she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom check your location while I'm at school. Dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realise she's literally sitting. They're refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day 3 mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 in a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see. Shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses the client. Client worth $2,000. Week two she sees I stopped at McDonald's for three minutes and lectures me about wasting money. Which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for four hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and ask her four hours at one store and mom glares at me like I should have warned her he was checking but how can I when she's watching my every move? She Used to text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until eleven PM. Dad mentions that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough. But I've been to that clinic. They close at 6. That night, dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits, and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives, marked Final Notice, and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that. And mom says, processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location pins on the map. Week 5, and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the medical plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11:00am, and it's now six PM. I tell my manager I'm sick and drive over. Dad's already there in the parking lot, looking at life. Three 60, zoomed in.

A few weeks ago, my best friend, Courtney, called me sobbing. I lost my baby Kate exactly 10 weeks ago. My stomach dropped. Courtney had miscarried four times now, all at precisely 10 weeks. I'm a nurse practitioner. That timing pattern doesn't occur naturally. I drove straight to her house where her husband, Joe answered looking exhausted. She's resting. This one hit her hard. I need to see her maybe tomorrow. Joe, I'm her best friend and I'm a nurse. Let me help. He reluctantly let me in. Courtney was in bed, pale. And when I hugged her, I noticed bruising on her inner arm, fresh needle marks, multiple injection sites. Courtney, these marks. She looked confused. I don't remember getting any shots. I just, I woke up with them after I blacked out last night. You blacked out? Joe interrupted us from the doorway. She faints sometimes, stress from the pregnancy. Three days later, Courtney was feeling better and we met for coffee. I've been thinking, she said. I never actually saw my regular OBGYN during any of my pregnancies. Joe always said he found better specialists. That seemed wrong. Doctor Holly, you've seen her for years. Joe said she was too busy. He'd take me to appointments, but I'd always feel so drowsy in the waiting room. He'd go in to talk to the doctor. While I rested in the car, I called Doctor Holly's office. That afternoon, pretending to be Courtney, checking on my records. I need to verify my appointment history for insurance. It's Roberts. Our records show you called to transfer your care elsewhere last year and the year before, always after positive pregnancy tests. That evening, Courtney texted me again. Found something weird. Joe keeps the detailed calendar in his phone. It has all my periods marked and there are red X's. Exactly 14 days after each period starts. Going back three years, 14 days after period starts is ovulation peak fertility. Courtney, does anything happen on the red X days? She thought about it. Around then is when Joe makes me tea. I guess he says it's good for sleep and fertility. I always take it because I'm usually tired and we want to start a family. I was so suspicious that the next day I came over the next day while Joe was at work. That's when Courtney showed me something else. I found this tiny safe in his closet, like the kind doctors use for medications, but it's locked. We tried every code we could think of, but nothing worked. Courtney think those nights he gives you the tea. What happens after she went pale? I always wake up feeling sore down there, Joe says. We tried for a baby, but I never remember it. My stomach turned. He was drugging her and assaulting her on her fertile days to get her pregnant. Oh, my god. Could the miscarriages Be him, she shot out. I thought back to my medical training. Courtney, does anything weird happen before each miscarriage? Any sort of pattern? She thought about it for a while. Now that I think about it, I get really sick days before. For each one, way more sick than usual. Her eyes went wide. Joe makes me soup, some special recipe he says helps with morning sickness. Every single time. Every time she yelled. He's insistent I eat it all. We went back to the safe. Courtney remembered something. His ex girlfriend's name was Marie. Her birthday was October 15th. The safe clicked open. Inside were vials of medications, two types, one labeled with a fertility drug code, the other.

We'll make your sister pay. She'll never say no to family. I froze with the grocery bags in my hands. Through the kitchen window, I could see them all sitting around the table, Mom, Dad and my brother Landon. Harper's got that new job, dad was saying, making good money now. We'll just tell her it's for Mom's surgery. Mom nodded. She gave us 12,000 for the roof last year, no questions asked. My stomach dropped. There was no roof repair. I'd seen the receipts myself. They'd used my money for Landon's gambling debts. How much this time, mom asked. 50,000, Landon said casually, maybe 60 if we play it right. Tell her the cancer came back. Cancer. They were going to fake cancer to steal from me. I backed away slowly, my mind racing. The cancer scare from two years ago, the one that made me liquidate my retirement fund to pay for experimental treatments. Had that been fake, too? I thought about all the times I'd help. The car accident that wasn't covered by insurance, Landon's business that needed start up capital, Mom's dental work, Dad's back surgery, $57,000 over five years, all because I thought I was being a good daughter.

I'd like to close all my accounts, I told the teller. All of them, miss every single one. And I need cashiers checks for the full amounts, documentation of every transaction I've made to these three people over the past five years. That evening, Landon called right on schedule. Hey, sis, can you come over tomorrow? Mom has some news about her health. His voice had that practiced concern, the same tone he'd used for every fake emergency. Sure, I said sweetly. I'll bring the whole family something special. I spent that night making copies of everything, bank statements, medical records I'd helped to pay for, receipts from Landon's failed ventures, five years of financial manipulation, all documented.

Now he regrets everything. When Jake knocked me up at 17, he laughed. Actually laughed. Said, my parents will kill me if this ruins my baseball scholarship. Within a week, his entire family moved three states away, ghosted me, blocked me, vanished like a coward in a Letterman jacket. But I wasn't going to be a statistic. My parents were furious, but weirdly supportive. They helped me finish high school online, and I gave birth to my son, Tommy, over Christmas break with Jingle Bells playing in the background. Cute, right? Tommy and I basically grew up together. I worked three jobs while getting my nursing degree. Mom watched him when she could. We ate so much ramen that he thought it was a food group. We lived in a tiny shoebox apartment with a couch I bought off Craigslist for $15 and dreams duct taped together. But it worked. By the time Tommy was 10, I was a pediatric ICU nurse, and he was this funny, smart, ridiculous little human who made life fun even on two hours of sleep. Then I met Daniel. Daniel's a pediatric surgeon. Smart, kind. Didn't blink when I told him I had a ten year old. On our third date, Tommy had a cold, and Daniel brought over soup and comic books. I think I fell in love. Right then, two years later, we got married and Daniel adopted Tommy. Tommy calls him dad like he Was born to. Because, honestly, he kind of was. We had twin girls three years ago, and Tommy is the sweetest big brother. Straight A student. Star pitcher for his high school, and I mean, star college. Scouts come to see him. Then last month, his team made it to the state championships. I was screaming my lungs out from the bleachers, phone in hand, filming every pitch like a full blown stage mom. That's when I saw Jake. Same face, just older. He was staring at Tommy like he was.

I said cancel the entire wedding. The call came Tuesday morning while I was editing a commercial in my home studio. This is Renee from Perfect Day Planning calling about Jared's wedding next month. Her voice sounded uncomfortable. I have some difficult news. Your family contacted us yesterday and asked us to remove you from the guest list entirely. They mentioned some family disagreements and said you wouldn't be welcome at the ceremony or reception. I paused my editing software. My family still sees me as the 29 year old college dropout who threw his life away to become a freelance videographer. What they don't know is what I actually do with all that video equipment filling my garage. However, Renee continued nervously. They also specifically requested to keep the fifty thousand dollar deposit you paid for the wedding photography package. Mrs. Ruth said the family had already allocated those funds to other wedding expenses and couldn't possibly return them. I leaned back in my chair looking at the wall of awards behind me, Emmy nominations, industry recognition, contracts with Fortune 500 company. My little video hobby had quietly become a 15 million dollar production company over the past eight years. Renee, I need to ask you something important. What's the name of your wedding venue? The Riverside Manor downtown. And who owns that property? I heard papers shuffling on Her end. Um, it's listed under Sunset Holdings LLC. Right. What about your catering company? Golden Plate Catering Services, also owned by longer pause Sunset Holdings LLC as well. Wait, what's going on here? The photography studio handling the wedding photos, Elite Moment Studio. Oh my god. That's also Sunset Holdings. The florist providing all the arrangements, Bella's Garden Creations. That's, that's you too, isn't it? The DJ company, the luxury transportation service, the rehearsal dinner venue, even the hotel block for out of town guests, all owned by Sunset Holdings LLC, which is my company. Renee's voice went up an octave. Mr Ruth, are you telling me that you own every single vendor for this wedding? I'm telling you that for the past eight months I've been secretly funding my brother's entire dream wedding through shell companies. I created every vendor, every service, every single detail of this wedding, all paid for by me through different LLCs so my family wouldn't know their disappointment son was actually footing the entire Bill for everything. This can't be happening. When I dropped out of film school 7 years ago, my parents told everyone I was throwing my life away. While they focused on Jared's safe marketing career at his corporate job, I was quietly building a production empire. Corporate videos, national commercials, award winning document energies. I work with Netflix, HBO, major advertising agencies. But to my family, I'm still just a failure who plays with cameras. Sir, what exactly are You saying? I'm saying cancel everything. The venue rental, catering contract, floral arrangements, photography package, DJ services, transportation, all of it. Every single contract goes through companies I own. the wedding is in three weeks. There are.

Emma had this habit of saying random things loudly at the worst possible moments, but this was next level embarrassing. Emma, honey, let's go play on the slides, I whispered, trying to drag her away from the wedding party, but she wasn't having it. She broke free from my grip and marched right up to the bride, tugging on her dress. Lady, don't marry the mean man, Emma said, pointing directly at the groom. He's gonna hurt you. Everyone went dead silent. The groom's face went red and he started walking toward us looking angry. Hey, what kind of kids says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just three and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve. My mommy had marks like that. When the bad man lived with us, she cried at night, too. Just like you smell like tears under your makeup. My heart stopped. This kid had been through way too much for her age, but she developed This weird ability to spot things adults tried to hide. When my ex was still around, Emma would always know when I'd been crying, even if I thought I'd covered it up perfectly.

What did you learn? My college girlfriend's family owned half the restaurants in our city. Their house had more bathrooms than my apartment building had units. The first time I went to dinner there, I counted three different forks at my place. Setting in panic, her dad, Mr Richardson, made it clear from day one that I wasn't good enough for his daughter. What does your father do? He asked. During that first dinner, when I said he was a mechanic, the temperature in the room dropped 10 degrees. For months, I tried to fit in. I bought clothes I couldn't afford, Learned about wine I'd never drink again, and pretended to understand their conversations about vacation homes and stock portfolios. I was drowning in debt just trying to keep up with their lifestyle. The breaking point came at Sarah's birthday party. Her parents threw this massive event at their country club. I showed up in my one good suit, feeling like a fraud among all the designer everything. Mr Richardson introduced me to his friends as Sarah's little project. That's when I snapped. I stopped trying to impress them. I started being myself again. The guy who worked two jobs, ate ramen for dinner and fixed his own car if they didn't like it. Tough. The weird thing, Sarah's younger brother, Marcus, started hanging around me more. He was 16, rebellious and clearly tired of his family's expectations while everyone else was Networking and name dropping, Marcus and I would sneak off to play video games in his room. One night, Marcus asked if I could teach him to change his car's oil. Dad just pays people to do everything, he said. I wanna actually know how stuff works. So we spent the weekend in my tiny garage getting our hands dirty and talking about real life. A few weeks later, Mr Richardson called me, not Sarah, me directly. I need to speak with you, he said in that cold voice I'd grown to hate.

I was a staff sergeant with 12 years in the army. Two combat deployments to Afghanistan, one to Iraq. I had an Army Commendation Medal with valor, a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart from when an IED flipped our vehicle outside Kandahar. I've been running my platoons operations for three years while my platoon sergeant was deployed elsewhere. Everyone assumed I'd make sergeant First class in the next promotion cycle. I had perfect evaluation reports, expert marksmanship badges, and my soldiers actually respected me. Then the promotion board results came out on a Friday afternoon. My name wasn't on the list. I walked into 1st sergeant Granger's office confused. Top. Can I ask what happened with my E7 packet? I thought I had a solid chance. He looked uncomfortable, pulled out my file and spread it across his desk. Jake, you had the highest tactical scores of anyone who applied. Your combat evaluations are outstanding. Your platoon has the best readiness numbers in the battalion. So what happened? He pointed to a single line on the scoring sheet. Education points. You needed a minimum of 15. You have eight. I stared at him. I have two years of community college credits. That's not enough. The new policy requires an associates degree minimum for E7. Your three classes short.

I was a staff sergeant with 12 years in the army, two combat deployments to Afghanistan, one to Iraq. I had an Army Commendation Medal with Valor, a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart from when an I E. D. Flipped our vehicle outside Kandahar. I've been running my platoons operations for three years while my platoon sergeant was deployed elsewhere. Everyone assumed I'd make sergeant first class in the next promotion cycle. I had perfect evaluation reports, expert marksmanship badges, and my soldiers actually respected me. Then the promotion board results came out on a Friday afternoon. My name wasn't on the list. I walked into 1st Sergeant Granger's office confused. Top, can I ask what happened with my E7 packet? I thought I had a solid chance. He looked uncomfortable, pulled out my file and spread it across his desk. Jake, you had the highest tactical scores of anyone who applied. Your combat evaluations are outstanding. Your platoon has the best readiness numbers in the battalion. So what happened? He pointed to a single line on the scoring sheet, education points. You needed a minimum of 15. You have eight. I stared at him. I have two years of community college credits. That's not enough. The new policy requires an associate degree minimum for E7. Your three classes short. Meanwhile, specialist Marcus Lee just finished his bachelor's degree online. He's only been in Four years, never deployed, but he got max points in the education category. Marcus, supply clerk who failed his last PT test. First sergeant nodded. He passed the promotion board. You didn't? The math doesn't lie. I felt my face getting hot. So 12 years of service, three combat tours and actual combat medals mean less than college classes about English literature? Jake, I don't make the rules. I'm just telling you what the board saw.

There's my successful boy. Wendy appeared behind him, studying my truck like it was a UFO. I thought you said he was still struggling. Interesting, Wendy, I said, stepping inside. What exactly did my father tell you about my situation? She glanced nervously at dad. Well, that you're doing okay now, but it's been tough. The lawn mowing hasn't really taken off. Lawn mowing. I pulled out my phone, opened my company website. Wendy, Meet Green Valley Commercial Services. We maintain the state capital grounds, three hospital complexes and half the office park in the county. Her eyes widened. This, this is yours. Every employee, every contract, every truck. I scrolled through photos of our equipment yard. We cleared 2.8 million last year. Wendy went hale. She turned to dad. You said he called asking for money last month. He did, didn't you, son? Dad's smile was cracking. Actually, dad, you called me asking for a 15 thousand dollar loan because Wendy's car got repossessed. Remember? I said no. The silence was dead. Wendy's voice dropped to a whisper. You told me he was begging you for help with Luke's medical school. I've never asked this man for a dime, I said calmly. Luke's education is fully funded, has been for three years. Dad started stammering excuses, but Wendy wasn't hearing it. She was putting pieces together and the picture wasn't pretty. So when you said we couldn't afford Cameron's tuition because you were supporting your struggling sons. You've been lying to me for years, she finished. I pulled out my business card, thick stock, embossed logo, the works. Wendy Cameron deserves college, but he deserves honest parents. More when you're ready to have that conversation without him. I nodded toward dad, call me. As I walked toward my truck, I heard the screaming match starting. Inside, neighbors were peeking out windows. Dad's perfect suburban facade was crumbling in real time. My phone buzzed this morning, Wendy's number, can we meet for coffee without him? Cameron texted, too. Is it true you offered to pay for my college? Sometimes the best revenge is just success and patience. And occasionally it's helping good people escape toxic situations, especially when those people happen to be innocent kids caught in the crossfire of adults lies.

Eight years after he kicked my brother and me out. I said no and exposed his lies to the entire family. Here's the twist. I'm actually loaded now and nobody knows it. When I was 18, dad remarried Wendy and decided his new family didn't have room for his old kids. Time to be independent, he said. Kicking me and my 16 year old brother Luke out with nothing but our clothes, his fake concern about character building. We crashed at friends houses, worked fast food, slept in my beat up Honda. Some nights dad would drive past us at the gas station where I worked and pretend not to see me pumping his gas. Real classy move. I started a lawn care business with a two hundred dollar pawn shop mower. Luke helped summers before going to community college on scholarships. We were just trying to survive while dad posted happy family photos with Wendy and her son Cameron in our old house, at our old dinner table. Living our old life like we never existed. Eight years crawled by. My little lawn care operation grew into something massive. Government contracts, commercial properties, forty employees across three cities. I kept it quiet, drove modest cars, lived simply. Meanwhile, Luke got into medical school. Full ride, courtesy of his big brother, who remembered what family actually means. Then dad calls last Tuesday. His voice has that fake friendly tone. I Remember from childhood manipulation sessions? Son, Wendy and I need to talk to you about Cameron's college situation. What situation? Well, he got into state, but the funding isn't quite there. Since you're doing well now. I almost choked. Doing well? Wendy heard through the Grapevine you've got some landscaping thing going. Some landscaping thing. Right. What exactly are you asking, Dad? Cameron's tuition is $30,000 a year. We figured since your family and Luke's education worked out. The audacity. The sheer fucking audacity. I'll think about it. I lied. That weekend, I drove to their house.

You've destroyed our family. Your family. Mine was at my wedding. Mom's on antidepressants because of you. Good. Maybe they'll help her see both children. He hung up, texted, you're not invited to my wedding. I replied, what wedding? When I have one, I'll schedule something. Unmovable that day. Father wants to meet. He's filed for separation. Sends flowers daily with variations of, sorry, I was coward. Mom still posts about her 2 beautiful children with Mike's game photos. None of me. Someone always comments, didn't you miss your daughter's wedding? She deletes them, posts again. The cycle continues. Grandfather called yesterday. Want me to go back there? No. She's doing that herself. Good girl. The wedding video. Arrived. Send it to them. Send it to Mike. Address it. The unmovable event. He laughed until he needed his inhaler. Families divided. Mother's sisters think I'm cruel. Father's family thinks I'm a saint for inviting them. Friends think this is the best thing ever. Lucas thinks I should forgive them eventually. For me, not them. Maybe someday. But today I'm looking at wedding photos where every face chose to be there. No empty seats, no missing parents, just people who showed up. That's the family I choose to keep.

I pretended to be my cousin, the substitute teacher for a day and accidentally got my dream job. I was 19, broke as hell and still waiting to hear back from community college. My cousin Tyler was a substitute teacher who sometimes paid me to drive him around since his car was trash. One Tuesday morning he calls me freaking out, dude, I just rear ended someone. I'm supposed to be at Westbrook Middle School in 20 minutes. If I miss another day, they'll cut me from their sub list. I was eating cereal in my pajamas. That sucks, man. Wait, he said, you still have my school ID from when you helped me move those boxes last month? Yeah. Why? I'm serious. Let's go. Pretend to be me. Take attendance. Keep them quiet. It's just study hall. I laughed. You're insane. Please. They won't even check. Most subs just sit there anyway. It's one period. Something about the desperation in his voice got to me, plus I needed money. I threw on Tyler's spare button down shirt that was way too big and drove to the school with his laminated badge. The front desk lady barely looked up. You must be the sub for Miss Peterson's class, room 2, 13. Here's your clipboard. I walked down that hallway trying to look confident while my heart was pounding. The kids were loud but not crazy. I took attendance, reading names off the Roster, when they asked where their teacher was, I said she had a family emergency and today was independent study. Can we work on homework, this girl asked. Absolutely, I said. Having no clue what else to tell them. For an hour, I just walked around pretending to supervise while they did whatever. Some kid asked me about math and I said I'd get back to him. Another wanted to use the bathroom and I let like 5 kids go because I didn't know the rules. Then the bell rang and a whole new group of kids walked in. Nobody had told me there were multiple periods. I panicked but tried to play it cool. Same routine, independent study day. The projector wasn't working, so sorry, no video today. I made them read silently and told them I'd be grading papers instead. I just stared at Tyler's lesson plan book trying to figure out what I was supposed to be doing. Third period came, then fourth. I was making it up as I went. When kids got too loud, I'd say stuff like, remember, this affects your participation grade, even though I had no idea how grading worked. During lunch, I hid in an empty classroom and texted Tyler updates. He kept saying, you're doing great, just get through the day. Fifth period, this kid asked me about the Revolutionary War assignment. I panicked and said, what do you think the most important battle was? Then I made them debate It while I googled stuff on my phone under the desk. By 6th period, I was actually getting comfortable. These kids weren't that different from my little brother and his friends. I started a trivia game about random stuff and they were actually into it. Then the assistant principal walked in my.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We've known each other since freshman year. And when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything, 50 50, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird serious face he starts with. So I've been thinking and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. But she's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue because honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I tell Her fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realize I bought literally everything that makes it nice. The 50 inch TV mounted on the wall, mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. The next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says, okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the TV and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realized.

I've never had an operation in my life. I was completely lost. Now the doctor looked up, surprised. You should probably take this up with your parents, but according to this, you had surgery when you were 7 years old. I called my dad right there from the hospital bed.

They moved on with the assembly, but no one heard a word. After that. Tyler became Spidey for the rest of high school. But here's the twist.

I heard it through the baby monitor, not the one in our daughter's room. The one I'd forgotten was still paired to my phone from when we moved it to the living room during renovations. My husband, Dale, was on the couch with his mother, Patricia. I was upstairs holding laundry, the monitor app running in the background. Marrying her was my biggest mistake, Dale said clearly. But with Lily and the mortgage, I'm trapped. Patricia's voice was soothing. Poor baby. You could have done so much better. Remember Jessica from your firm? Now she was marriage material. Don't remind me. Instead, I'm stuck with someone who thinks loading a dishwasher is a personality trait. They both laughed. I sat down the shirt I was holding, and listened to my husband of seven years explain how unbearable I was, how I'd let myself go after having Lily, how my cooking was aggressively mediocre, how he fantasized about being single every day. You can always come home, Patricia offered. Your room is exactly how you left it. I wish, but she'd take everything in the divorce. Maybe when Lily's older. I turned off the monitor and sat on our bed processing. Seven years, a daughter, a house we built together. And he was planning his escape while I washed his underwear. The next morning, Dale acted normal, kissed my cheek, complained About traffic. Left for his accounting job. Patricia called an hour later. Sweetie, Dale mentioned you've been stressed. Why don't I come help you reorganize? A tidy house makes everything better. Normally, I'd have made excuses. Patricia's help usually meant criticism disguised as suggestions. Today. Today I had a different idea. That would be wonderful, Patricia. Actually, Dale's home office is a disaster. Maybe we can start there. She arrived that afternoon with her label maker and color coded bins, thrilled to finally fix our household. Started in Dale's office. I pulled out box after box. He has so much stuff. I said, maybe we should pack some of it. You know, streamline. Patricia's eyes lit up. Exactly what I've been saying. Dale hoards everything. We packed his college trophies, old tax documents and electronics he never used. Patricia was ruthless. If he hadn't touched it in six months, it went in a box. She hummed while she worked, occasionally muttering about her poor, trapped baby. Let's do his closet next. Segregated. By the time Dale came home, we packed 12 boxes. His office was bare except for his desk and computer. Half his closet was in storage containers. What the hell happened? He asked, staring at the boxes. Patricia beamed. We're decluttering.

Weeks later, she bragged about it and mom overheard everything. I was 15 when my sister Becca destroyed my life. She was 14, the golden child who could set the kitchen on fire and dad would call it a learning experience. I forgot to mow the lawn once and I was heading nowhere past eleven PM, my door slammed open. Both parents stormed in. Dad's veins visible behind them. Becca fake cried. He bullet. I saw him take it from Dad's wallet. Dad grabbed my pillow, crumpled bills, maybe $300 fell out. I told you, Becca said, tears streaming. That's not mine. She planted it enough, dad barked, a liar and a thief. Mom didn't look at me. Becca stood behind them smirking. Dad tore up my room, tossing belongings into a trash bag. I'm scared to share a house with him, Becca sniffled out. Now they shoved the bag into my arms. Dad, I jerked the door open. Night air hit like ice. I was barefoot in sweatpants. Dad pushed me onto the porch. I grabbed my sneakers before he slammed the door. You don't come back until you apologize. I was 15, standing outside with nowhere to go. She'd won the first night. Lindsay let me stay. After three nights, her mom said she couldn't afford another mouth. I couch surfed for a week, then started sleeping behind the gas station near The dumpsters. My $40 vanished on burgers. After that, I skipped meals at school. Kids pulled backpack closer. A basketball player shoulder checked me. Watch your hands, thief. By Week 2, I was a ghost. One night behind the gas station, Becca appeared with a Pepsi. Didn't think you'd last this long. Why are you doing this? Try being me. Every grade compared to you. Don't be like your brother now. I don't have to be perfect. I'm not giving that up. Her grin widened. What's sick is how easy it was. Everyone already thought you were the screw up. By week 3, I'd hit bottom. Money gone, phone dead. Hadn't eaten in two days. Lindsay found me under a laundromat awning. She handed me $60, her allowance saved up. Becca bragged at a party she told people she planted the money. She admitted it. Yeah. But nobody believed her. That night I walked home. I was done running. My fist hit the door. Becca opened, sneering. I shoved past her. I'm here to talk. Mom appeared. Dad followed, arms folded. Leave. Dad said, no, you threw me out because Becca cried. You didn't ask for my side. Dad clenched his jaw. You want me to admit we favored her? Fine. We did. I turned to Becca. Swear you didn't plant that money. Sure, I swear. Voice dripping sarcasm. Dad slammed a glass down so hard it shattered. Guards cut my arm and cheek. Blood dripped. Get out before I Call the cops. One day you'll see her for what she is. I grabbed my bag and walked out. Halfway down the block, footsteps followed. Becca jogged behind me. I wanted to see how far you take this. Farther than you think. Nobody's ever going to believe you. Say it again. She leaned in, whispering. I frame.

My husband's friend Kate always had to be the main character in every situation. When someone else had good news, Kate suddenly had better news. At group dinners, she'd hijack any conversation within five minutes. I couldn't stand her, but I put up with it because she and Zach had been friends since college. After my husband and I announced our pregnancy at 12 weeks, things with Kate got really weird. Suddenly, Kate was everywhere we went sporting a small baby bump. She showed up at our favorite brunch spot rubbing her belly. She enrolled in our exact prenatal yoga class. She even switched to our OB practice. Nobody questioned it because these things happen, and women get pregnant at the same time. She posted weekly bump photos on Instagram, and everyone congratulated her just like they did me. Three months in, one of our friends mentioned something strange at a girls night. She said Kate's belly looked bigger a previous Tuesday at book club than it did at Saturday's barbecue. When she brought it up, Kate burst into tears about how cruel it was to comment on a pregnant woman's body. She went on about water retention and bloating and how pregnant women deal with enough judgment without their friends piling on. Our friend felt terrible and apologized profusely while the rest of us comforted Kate. After that night, nobody dared mention anything about her appearance again. Even though I Started noticing her bump size seemed to fluctuate, too. That's when things got uncomfortable. Kate started making comments about how wild it was that we got pregnant around the same time. She'd joke about our babies being best friends, maybe even more than friends someday. Then the jokes got stranger, like when she said Pregnancy Brain made her forget exactly when she conceived. And wasn't it funny how close our due dates were? She started showing up at every single appointment Zach and I had. Always in the waiting room when we arrived, claiming her appointment was right before or after hours. During our maternity photo shoot at the park, she appeared with her own photographer, saying what a coincidence that she'd booked the same spot. The photographer later told me Kate had called asking what time we'd be there. Everything exploded at my baby shower. My sister threw this beautiful garden party with all our family and friends there to celebrate. Halfway through opening gifts, Kate stood up and clinked her glass to make an announcement. With tears streaming down her face, she placed her hand on her belly and said, I have the most wonderful news to share with everyone. Zack and I are having a baby together! The entire party gasped, and she continued with a huge smile, I know this is unconventional, but isn't it beautiful that our babies will be siblings?

I said cancel the entire wedding. The call came Tuesday morning while I was editing a commercial in my home studio. This is Renee from Perfect Day Planning calling about Jared's wedding next month. Her voice sounded uncomfortable. I have some difficult news. Your family contacted us yesterday and asked us to remove you from the guest list entirely. They mentioned some family disagreements and said you wouldn't be welcome at the ceremony or reception. I paused my editing software. My family still sees me as the 29 year old college dropout who threw his life away to become a freelance videographer. What they don't know is what I actually do with all that video equipment filling my garage. However, Renee continued nervously. They also specifically requested to keep the fifty thousand dollar deposit you paid for the wedding photography package. Mrs. Ruth said the family had already allocated those funds to other wedding expenses and couldn't possibly return them. I leaned back in my chair looking at the wall of awards behind me, Emmy nominations, industry recognition, contracts with Fortune 500 company. It's my little video hobby. Had quietly become a 15 million dollar production company over the past eight years. Renee, I need to ask you something important. What's the name of your wedding venue? The Riverside Manor downtown. And who owns that property? I heard papers shuffling. On her end. Um, it's listed under Sunset Holdings LLC. Right. What about your catering company? Golden Plate Catering Services, also owned by Longer Pot Sunset Holdings LLC as well. Wait, what's going on here? The photography studio handling the wedding photos, Elite Moment Studio. Oh my god. That's also Sunset Holdings. The florist providing all the arrangements, Ella's Garden Creations. That's, that's you too, isn't it? The DJ company, the luxury transportation service, the rehearsal dinner venue, even the hotel block for out of town guests, all owned by Sunset Holdings LLC, which is my company. Renee's voice went up an octave. Mr Ruth, are you telling me that you own every single vendor for this wedding? I'm telling you that for the past eight months I've been secretly funding my brother's entire dream wedding through shell companies. I created every vendor, every service, every single detail of this wedding, all paid for by me through different LLCs so my family wouldn't know their disappointment son was actually footing the entire Bill for everything. This can't be happening. When I dropped out of film school 7 years ago, my parents told everyone I was throwing my life away. While they focused on Jared's safe marketing career at his corporate job, I was quietly building a production empire. Corporate videos, national commercials, award winning documentaries. I work with Netflix, HBO, major advertising agencies. But to my family, I'm still just a failure who plays with cameras. Sir, what exactly are You saying? I'm saying cancel everything. The venue rental, catering contract, floral arrangements, photography package, DJ services, transportation, all of it. Every single contract goes through companies I own. the wedding is in three weeks. There are.

I grabbed one of them by the collar and fricked with no mercy it department fucked. I changed their Wi-Fi password to I love fanboy 67. By the time I reached the CEO's office, security had gathered. Employees were Panicking, alarms were blaring and someone was live streaming the whole thing on TikTok. I slammed my hands on the CEO's desk and said, voice trembling, renew my subscription or face the Baka. The man blinked, looked at me and whispered, sir, you could have just used the free trial. I saw red after that. Once I finished, the CEO started gasping for air.

My first week at McDonald's, I kept having to tell customers our ice cream machine was broken, so I did what nobody else would. Their faces would drop every single time, especially the kids who just wanted a cone or Mcflurry after their Happy Meal. It had been broken for two months, according to my coworkers, who just shrugged and said that's how it always was. I used to makes equipment at my uncle's restaurant all the time. Fryers and drink machines and even some refrigeration units. So when it was slow on a Tuesday afternoon, I decided to take a look at the ice cream machine. Manager Karen was off that day, and the shift supervisor told me to go for it if I thought I could help. The machine wasn't that complicated once I got the panels off. The main issue was a clogged valve and some sensors that needed cleaning. Years of dried milk product had gunked up the works. I spent three hours taking it apart piece by piece and cleaning everything with the approved sanitizer. My coworkers started gathering around as I worked. Kaylee, who had been there five years, said she'd never seen anyone even try to fix it. Jason started taking bets on whether I'd get it working. Even some customers at the counter were watching and cheering me on like I was performing surgery. When I finally got everything back together and hit The power button. The machine hummed to life. The display showed all green lights for the first time in months. I ran a test patch, and out came perfect soft serve vanilla ice cream. The whole crew erupted in cheers and applause. Words spread fast through the restaurant. Customers who had been turned away earlier came back for ice cream. We sold more cones and Mcflurries in two hours than the store usually sold in a week. Everyone was so happy. Kids were getting their desserts, and employees didn't have to deal with disappointed customers anymore. I felt like a hero, honestly. My coworkers kept patting me on the back and saying I should get a raise. One older lady bought an extra cone just to thank me for fixing it. The shift supervisor even let me take an extra break as a reward. I went home that night feeling proud of taking initiative and solving a problem that had been plaguing the store. The next morning, I walked in to find Karen waiting for me in the office. She had this look on her face, like I burned down the building. Before I could even clock in, she handed me a termination notice dated two weeks out. I stood there confused, trying to understand what I was reading. You tampered with the ice cream machine, she said in this cold voice. I tried explaining that I fixed it, and customers were happy and we were selling ice cream again. She cut me off and pulled out this thick manual. Turns out McDonald

I always had this weird feeling about my Uncle Pete. Like, everyone in my family absolutely loved the guy. He was the fun uncle. You know, the one who'd show up to family barbecues with his loud laugh and those expensive gifts that made all us kids go crazy. He take us out for burgers, let us play games on his phone for hours. And somehow he always knew all the latest slang before we did. But something about Pete just felt off to me. Maybe it was how he'd always squeeze into your personal space when he talked to you, standing way too close. Or how he always wanted to be alone with one of us kids, saying stuff like, let the grown UPS talk and pulling us into another room. My parents thought it was sweet that he wanted to spend time with us. I was 16 when my little cousin Emily started acting different. Emily was always this bubbly kid who asked a million questions and made everyone laugh with her silly jokes. But suddenly she got quiet. Like, really quiet. She stopped joking around completely. Stopped asking her usual why this and why that questions. When I'd ask her what was wrong, she'd just shrug and say she was tired. That wasn't Emily at all. One Saturday, I was helping my dad clean out the garage. We were sorting through old tools and junk when I saw this spare Key hanging on a little hook. It had a label that said Pete in my dad's handwriting. That made zero sense to me. Pete didn't live with us. He had his own apartment across town. Why would he need a key to our house? I asked my dad about it. He just chuckled and said Pete probably made a copy years ago when they used to share tools back and forth. You know how your uncle is always borrowing something dad said. But something about that explanation felt wrong. Pete hadn't borrowed tools in years. That night I couldn't sleep. Something about that key kept bugging me. Why would Pete still need access to our house? Why was the key hanging in the garage where everyone could see it? The more I thought about it, the weirder it seemed. The next day, I decided to fake being sick and stay home from school. I told my mom I had a headache and she believed me. After everyone left for work and school, I just waited. I had this gut feeling that something was going to happen. Around two forty five PM, right before Emily usually walked home from school and stopped by our house to wait for her mom to pick her up, I heard the garage door open, but nobody was supposed to be home. I looked out the window and saw Pete's blue Honda pulling into our driveway. My heart started pounding. Pete walked straight into the garage. Like he owned the place. Grab that key and let himself into the house through the side door. He didn't even knock or call out to see if anyone was home. He just walked right in. I followed him from upstairs, trying to be as quiet as possible. He went straight to the downstairs guest room, where Emily usually waited. When she came over, Pete looked around. Then

She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd deplete, she'd push harder, come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nursery and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail. When she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages, desperately searching for any evidence of Our name decision. My husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use it first. She wouldn't do that, he said. But I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created bacon interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with final decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. And Maya came over for dinner. I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition. And I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think? She'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labour. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived! The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction. To her surprise, The next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness. When I walked into her room, she actually had the audacity to say, I hope you don't mind that we ended up using Aurora when she was born. It just felt so right for our daughter. I know you guys were considering it, too. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed her our real pic.

I've been the family disappointment for 23 years while my perfect older brother Kyle got everything handed to him when Grandpa died and left me his house in his will. Dad absolutely lost it. There's no way that senile old man left you anything, he snarled, pacing around our kitchen like a king aged animal. You're probably not even my real son. Anyway, your mother was sleeping around before we got married. My brother Kyle smirked from the corner. Yeah, remember how wild mom was back in college? Dad's got a point. My stepmother Linda chimed in with that fake sweet voice she always used. Honey, we just want what's fair for the real family. You understand, right? They gave me 48 hours to take a paternity test or they challenge the will in court. The whole extended family was already texting about it in the group chat, calling me a fraud and a bastard. Here's what none of them knew. I've been secretly taking care of Grandpa for the past two years while they all ignored him. Every single doctor's appointment when his arthritis got bad, every grocery run when he couldn't drive anymore, every lonely evening when he just wanted someone to talk to about grandma. I also knew about the second will he'd written just three months before he died. The next morning, dad changed the locks on Grandpa's house when I showed up with my key. I couldn't get in. My stuff was piled on the front lawn in garbage bags. You're trespassing, dad yelled from the window. This is family property until you prove you belong here. I called the police. Within an hour, Officer Ortiz was standing in the driveway reading the will. Sir, according to this legal document, your son owns this property. You're the one trespassing. Dad's face went red as they made him give me the new keys. The neighbors were all.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We'd known each other since freshman year, and when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything fifty fifty, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back, thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird, serious face. He starts with. So I've been thinking, and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time, I cleaned up after myself, and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. But she's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue, because, honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I tell her, fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved, like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything, and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realise I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine. The leather couch we're always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day. I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff, like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the TV and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target, and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. I'm walking out with it. I realised she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that really made me laugh. When I was packing up the kitchen stuff, I realised I'd bought all the cooking supplies too. The pans, the good knife set, even the can opener. I left her with basically nothing except a mini fridge and some random cups she had from high school. By the time I finished loading everything, the apartment looked like nobody had ever lived there. Just empty rooms with

The bride stopped mid pose. Her photographer looked confused and about 30 wedding guests turned to stare at my three year old daughter Emma standing by the playground swings. I was mortified. Emma had this habit of saying random things loudly at the worst possible moments, but this was next level embarrassing. Emma, honey, let's go play on the slides, I whispered, trying to drag her away from the wedding party, but she wasn't having it. She broke free from my grip and marched right up to the bride, tugging on her dress. Lady, don't marry the mean man, Emma said, pointing directly at the groom. He's gonna hurt you. Everyone went dead silent. The groom's face went red and he started walking toward us looking angry. Hey, what kind of kid says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just 3 and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve. My mommy had marks like that when the bad man lived with us. She cried at night, too, just like you smell like tears under your makeup. My heart stopped. This kid had been through way too much for her age, but she developed This weird ability to spot things adults tried to hide. When my ex was still around, Emma would always know when I'd been crying, even if I thought I'd covered it up perfectly.

Like, actually lactose intolerant. Not the kind where people are like, oh, I just feel a little bloated. I mean, the kind where if I eat dairy, I'm gonna be stuck in the bathroom for, like, two hours straight, sweating and regretting every life choice that LED me to that moment. It's not cute, it's not fun. And I've told my boyfriend this about a million times, but every single time I make tacos for us, he does this thing where he goes on and on about how I'm disrespecting Mexican culture by not putting cheese on my tacos. He'll do this whole dramatic speech like he's some kind of food historian, talking about authenticity and tradition and whatever. And here's the kicker. He's not even Mexican. He's white. Like, his name is Tyler, and he grew up in the suburbs eating chicken nuggets and Mac and cheese from a box. Suddenly he's the taco police. I've told him so many times to knock it off. I've explained that I'm not trying to disrespect anyone. I just don't want to spend my entire evening camped out on the toilet. I've even offered to make his tacos with cheese if he wants, but he always says no and then continues making the same stupid jokes. It got old after, like, the second time, but he kept going. So last night, we're having tacos again. I made everything from scratch. See, in the meat. Chopped up all the toppings, laid everything out nice. I was actually pretty proud of how it all turned out. We sit down to eat, and of course, he starts up again with the cheese thing. I just rolled my eyes and ignored him because I was over it. I got up to go to the bathroom, just a normal, quick trip. And when I came back to the table, something looked off. My taco looked different, like someone had messed with it. I picked it up and started pulling back the lettuce and tomatoes, and there it was. Shredded cheese buried underneath everything, like he thought I wouldn't notice. I just stared at it for a second because I couldn't believe he actually did that. Like, what kind of.

My daughter in law called me Thursday night and I could hear her voice crack before she even said anything. She told me she couldn't make it to the spa weekend we paid for because my son decided his friend was in town and he wanted to hang out with them instead. Just like that, her birthday weekend gone. I already noticed she looked exhausted last time I visited. Three kids under 4 years old and she's doing everything alone. My son convinced her to quit her job and stay home by selling her this perfect picture of family life. What he didn't tell her was when I stayed home with him, his dad and I split everything 50, 50 after 5. I got Sundays off. I got date nights twice a week. She gets nothing. So I pushed a little, asked how things really were. She broke down and told me everything. He doesn't help with the kids, doesn't do chores, doesn't take her out, just sits there acting like she's supposed to handle three babies alone because that's what stay at home moms do. I was so angry I could barely think straight. I told her to drop the kids with me, bring a friend to the spa, and I gave her ‚Ç¨500 from my savings to buy herself something nice. She cried and thanked me. Then I made her tell me where My son was, took me five minutes of begging, but she finally said he was at Murphy's Bar downtown. The second she left for the spa, I grabbed my keys and drove straight there, found him and his buddies in the back corner laughing and drinking like he didn't have a care in the world. I sat down right next to their table. His friends went quiet first. Then he looked up and saw me. I said loud enough for the whole group to hear, did I fail you as a mother or was it your father? Because we both thought you were supposed to put your partner first, not your drunk friends. Face went red immediately. One of his buddies mumbled something and got up to leave. I kept going, told him his wife is home alone every single day with three kids while he's out here acting like he's still 20. Told him I didn't raise him to treat people like this. Told him his father would be ashamed. He tried to tell me to leave, that I was embarrassing him. I said, good, maybe he should be embarrassed. The bartender came over and told me I needed to go. I told my son he better fix this or he'd lose everything. Then I left. Got banned from the bar on my way out.

Are you two okay? Did you step on any glass? Culloy just laughed. I'm fine, mom. Sorry about the juice. She ruffled his hair in response, which shocked me beyond belief. It's just juice, baby. Accidents happen. Let me get the mop. No timer, no rice, no locked doors, just a mop and a new glass of juice later. When I reached for a third lumpia, I froze, waiting for someone to slap my hand away. Elena noticed and pushed the whole plate toward me. Eat, eat. Growing boys need food. When dinner time came and I said I had to leave, she packed me a container of food for later, she said, winking. Cally complained his report card came and he got a C in English. I tensed waiting for the explosion. Elena just sighed and said, we'll get you a tutor. These things happen. It felt so weird watching this, watching how Chloe's mother never got angry at him for doing something wrong. I even started thinking if this is how a normal home looks like. We were washing dishes together after dinner when I accidentally knocked over Elena's favorite mug, the one that said World's Okayest mom that Palloy had given her. It shattered against their tile floor. I went completely rigid, my whole body preparing for impact. The apology stuck in my throat. I could already feel my knees against rice, already felt the sun on my face. It's okay, Elena said softly. But I was already crying. Not just tears, but uncontrollable sobbing I couldn't control. Elena was sweeping up the pieces, humming, sweetheart, what's wrong, she asked, hailing beside me. It's just a mug. Why are you so scared? Cologne was staring at me like I'd grown another head. What did you think was going to happen? He asked. I tried to hold it in, but couldn't. I told them about how my mom treated me, about how I thought I was going to be punished severely because I'd broken that mug. Elena's face went through expressions I'd never seen on an adult, horror, rage, then something soft and broken. She pulled me into a hug that felt warm. Then she asked, how many times has that happened? Caloil patted my back as I answered, too many to count. When I finished talking, Elena looked at me for a long moment. You're not going home tonight, she said firmly. She picked up her phone, scrolled through her contacts. Caloil squeezed my shoulder as she dialed. Hello? I need to report child abuse.

I forgot to take out the trash before 6 p m. And started crying before my mom even said anything. Because I knew what was coming. She grabbed my arm, dragged me to the kitchen, and poured uncooked rice across the floor. Kneel on it, she said. I dropped to my knees, and the rice dug into my skin like tiny needles. She set the microwave timer for 20 minutes. You'll stay there until it beeps. This is how you learn discipline. My knees went numb after five minutes, but if I shifted even slightly, she'd restart the timer. I'm making you perfect. This is what love looks like. That wasn't just normal for us. It was routine. When I got a B instead of an A, she'd make me stand outside in the sun for three hours. No water, doors locked, neighbors walking by. Pretending not to see the world is cruel, she'd say when she finally let me back in. I'm preparing you for it. Every punishment makes you stronger. This is how a good mother loves her son. Then a new kid named Clyde transferred into my class, and he became my first friend. After I helped him with an assignment, he told me, come to my place after school. My mom makes incredible Filipino food. I almost said no, but I hadn't eaten anything except school lunch in two days. So I said yes, hoping I could make it back home by five, just for an hour, I said, already calculating how fast I need to run home. His house was only six blocks from school, a small two story with a garden full of tomatoes and a doormat that said welcome in three languages. His mom, Elena, opened the door before we could knock. You must be Chloe's friend. Come in, come in. I made lumpia. She had flower in her hair, but it didn't dampen her bright smile. The house smelled like fried food and something we baking. Not like the cigarette smoke and cheap wine that clung to our walls. A few minutes later, as Coloy was carrying two glasses of juice, he tripped over their cat. The glass shattered across the hardwood floor, orange juice spreading everywhere. My brain froze, and I acted on instinct. I immediately dropped to my knees, frantically picking up glass pieces with my bare hands, already stammering apologies that weren't mine to make. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. We'll clean it up. Please don't. But Elena was already rushing over, not to slap coloy, but instead to kneel beside me. Honey, stop! You'll cut yourself. She gently took my hand.

If you mention liking something, she'd become an expert overnight. If you posted about a restaurant, she coincidentally appeared during our date. It started subtle, almost innocent, even like next to Kevin at every family dinner, Ariana would squeeze between us, claiming she couldn't hear from the other end. I didn't mind since family is family. But after six months, it got obvious. Kevin joined a gym near his office. Ariana got a membership there the next day, showing up during his workout times and tiny sports bras. Kevin mentioned liking astronomy once. Suddenly, Ariana was texting him NASA articles daily, asking, can you explain this to me? Then came the fake emergencies. Her car broke down near Kevin's office. Her apartment had a gas leak when I was out of town. She needed help moving heavy boxes that turned out to be empty, Kevin always told me, immediately showing me her texts with eye rolls. She's just young and confused, he'd say. And I agreed until she officially went too far. A hard knock at 9:00am and there stood Ariana in a tiny white sundress, makeup, hair curled like a magazine shoot. I Need Kevin's help moving furniture, she announced, pushing past me. Where is he? But we both knew she lived in a furnished apartment. I was about to tell her to leave when she added, I'm sure you have errands to run. You can go away now. She was literally trying to dismiss me from my own home. Kevin came downstairs and she immediately grabbed his arm. Oh, perfect. You're already dressed. I promise I'll return him in one piece. Actually winked at me. I felt my chest burn with rage, but then had a different thought. I headed upstairs, loudly saying, I need to take a bath. But I didn't leave or go to the bathroom. I stayed upstairs where I could hear everything through the vents. Didn't waste any time. Oh, my God, Kevin, you're so muscular, she giggled, clearly touching his arm. Do you work out every day? I bet you could lift me with one hand. Wanna try? I rolled my eyes. This girl had zero shame. I kept folding laundry, waiting for Kevin's polite deflection. Instead, I heard him say, seriously, Ariana, can I tell you something important? My heart sank. Oh, god, here we.

My roommate said the girl was literally acting it out at the water fountain, pretending to be me, pushing her chest out and everything. Her friends were all laughing. I was so annoyed. Like I was out there for two minutes filling up a water bottle. I wasn't doing anything. But apparently this girl had turned it into some whole dramatic story where I was trying to seduce her boyfriend. That night I had to go brush my teeth before bed. I was already in my pajamas, which was just a T-shirt and shorts. And obviously I wasn't wearing a bra because I was getting ready for bed. I passed the girl and a few of her friends in the hallway on my way to the bathroom. The girl looked directly at my chest, then looked at her friends and they all started giggling. I just kept walking, but I was pissed. Then yesterday, the entire dorm got an email from our R A. It said she'd received some anonymous complaints about people not dressing appropriately in the hallways and asked everyone to please make sure they're keeping things covered up. I knew exactly who submitted that complaint. This girl had literally gone to the R a. And complained about me not wearing a bra in my own dorm. I was done being nice about it. I remembered from orientation that the girl's boyfriend doesn't actually go to school here. He goes to some Other college like an hour away. I also remembered that because of the pandemic, our dorm has a rule that we're not allowed to have non student guests this year. Only students from our school and family members are allowed in the building. And on top of that, everyone has to wear a mask in the hallways. It is a rule that barely anyone follows, but it's still technically a rule. So I went to the same anonymous complaint form that the girl had obviously used and I submitted a complaint. I'd noticed people bringing their off campus boyfriends into the dorm and that these guests weren't wearing masks in the hallways. I kept it vague, didn't mention any names, just like she did with hers. This morning, we all got another email from the Ra. It said that due to anonymous complaints, they'd be enforcing the no off campus guests rule from now on. Anyone bringing a guest into the building would have to show their student ID at the front desk to prove they actually go to school here and masks would be enforced in the hallways. I saw the girl in the hallway later that day and she looked mad. She was on the phone with someone, probably her boyfriend, saying something like, I don't know, they're checking IDS now you can't come over anymore.

My coach told me that they were not bringing me in for the next season. What he didn't mention was that I'd been his starting point guard for three years, team captain since junior year. My whole future depended on those three games. I even got my Jersey number tattooed on my shoulder, 23, the same number my dad wore when he played. But when Coach Miller called me into his office that Monday morning, he couldn't even look me in the eye, just stared at his desk, shuffling the same papers over and over, clicking his pen repeatedly like he always did when he was nervous. My nephew, Keith just transferred from Preston Prep. He needs stability right now. I just nodded quietly even though my chest felt like it was caving in. Whatever's best for the team, I said. He seemed shocked I wasn't arguing. Probably expected me to beg, maybe cry like Johnson did when he got cut last year. Instead, I cleaned out my locker in complete silence, folded my practice gear with the same precision I used for my pre game rituals. My Jersey hanging on the hook, the one with the captain's patch my mom had sewn on herself. Keith was already in the gym wearing my number, running my plays, using my parking spot. That afternoon I drove across town to our biggest rival school, hands shaking the whole Way their star player had just torn his knee at a party trying to dunk on a lowered rim. Coach Thompson nearly fell over when I walked in. You serious? He asked, already reaching for transfer paperwork before I even finished explaining. Two days later, I was practicing with my new team, wearing No. 5 because my number was already taken. Strange faces, different plays, but hungry eyes that reminded me why I love basketball. First game in the new uniform, I played the best game of my life against the defending state champions, the same team that had destroyed us.

I was halfway through my sandwich when the old speakers buzzed loudly. They always did before an announcement, but this time it didn't sound like the lunch schedule. Principal's voice came on, but it was shaky. Attention, students, everyone must return to their classrooms immediately and lock the doors. This is not a drill. The lunch lady stopped serving and I looked at my friends and they looked at me and then we all moved at once. By the time we got to class, our teacher was already closing the blinds. She locked the door behind us and told us to move our desks to the corner away from the windows. Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing, there was a shooter. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Our teacher tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking, kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that they were right outside and I believe them. I looked at our teacher and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids and told us it would be okay. But after a while, she got up again and walked. Back to her laptop. Then something changed because her face went pale. She looked at me and asked if there was a Jack Arthur in here. The whole class turned to me like I was in trouble. She asked me to come to her and whispered if I had anything in the room that belonged to me. And I told her just my backpack. She told me to grab it and wait by the door. I didn't understand what was happening, so I waited. Few minutes later, there was a knock and the teacher opened the door and told me to go with the officer. Outside the hallway was full of cops and medics. I thought maybe I was being arrested and tried to think what I did wrong. But then I saw the soda machine near the bathrooms tipped over and next to it a shoe and a leg sticking out. The officer stepped in front of me fast and told me to keep my eyes forward, but I'd already seen it. He took me to a side room and told me to wait. Then the door opened and my uncle walked in. He lives an hour away and he never comes to school. So I asked him if I was in trouble but told me I was safe. I asked about my little brother Timmy, but he didn't answer. Instead, he told me I needed to be strong for him. But I didn't understand. He asked me to Wear a blindfold and told me.

I care about my teenage boy, but I'd be dishonest if I said I wasn't let down by the kind of person he's becoming. My son began getting into this different look back when he was in middle school. At first he just wore black clothes, but once he got to high school, he's gone way too far with his strange style and I really don't like it. My wife doesn't seem to mind, but she's a pretty passive woman and has never been a very strict parent like me. If I were to describe how my son dresses now, he wears big, baggy black clothing and lots of chains and rings. At one point, he was even dying coloured strips into his hair. I remember being so upset the first day I saw this. It was just so embarrassing to see my child walking around like that. Now, I don't have a problem with gay people or anything like that, but I never really wanted that type of thing to be a part of my own household. I've never confronted my son about his sexuality and I really just don't wanna know if he does happen to be. Our relationship is already sort of strained and I feel like if I found out he wasn't straight, it would make it very hard for me to treat him the same. Like I said, I don't have a problem with gay people. I just don't wanna be shoved in my face on top of everything. Ever since my son entered high school, he's made friends with mostly girls. At first I was glad to see this, and I was happy that my son still might have a chance of growing up into a real man's man. But as time went on, I realized that he wasn't in a relationship with any of these girls dead. They were all just his close friends. He constantly has his friends over the house and is part of a friend group with three other girls. To be fair, these girls have always been nothing but polite to me and my wife and are always respectful of our house. Still, it just rubs me the wrong way that my son doesn't seem to have any close guy friends. And I feel like it's not good for him to grow up that way. I tried my best to be non judgmental towards my son, even though to me he looked like more of a freak of nature. Every day the more he kept leaning into his alternative fashion. I didn't understand it, since all of his friends were normal girls. He was the only weirdo in his friend group who dressed like some 90s mall rat. When I look at him, he honestly reminds me of the kind of kids I would pick on in high school. Anyway, about a Year ago, I ran out of patience with him when he came home one day with his nails painted a shade of bright blue. My son had never done anything like this before, and I couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly disgusted. I told him that he had gone too far with his emo bullshit and that I couldn't continue letting him make a fool out of himself like this. I told him that at one point he needed to become a man, and painting his nails made him look like some sort of weak top. My son and I had never really been close. We didn't even speak that often, so he looked very hurt as I was telling him all this. But I couldn't help it. He had needed a reality check for so long and there was no avoiding this conversation. I told my son to go get nail polish remover and remove his nail polish right there in front of me. That's when he started to get angry and said that he didn't have to change himself just to appease my dumb, homophobic son. My son has never spoken to either of his parents this way, and I knew that there was no way I was letting him get away with it. I yelled at him for cursing at me like that, and I told him that he would remove his nail polish immediately or there would be serious consequences. He said that there was nothing worse. I could do to him than continue being such a hateful father. And that's when I lost my shot. I told him that I would ground him for the entire year if he didn't remove his nail polish within the next 60 seconds. Looked at me and told me that I could try, but I would never be able to control him and that he hated me. He ran up to his room after this, and I followed through on my threat. I took his phone away and replaced it with a flip phone, and he wasn't allowed to go out or have his friends over anymore. All he did after that for the rest of the year was call his friends in his room and completely ignore me. One night, I overheard him crying to my wife about how much he hated his life since being grounded. But all she said was that I was his father and he needed to respect me. Proud of my wife for sticking up to me behind closed doors. And I still felt like I had made the right decision. I won't lie and say that it hasn't been a difficult year. My son stopped talking to me the day I grounded him, and I honestly do miss him. He graduates next year, and I just hope before then he'll realise that I was only ever trying to do what was best for him.

I still took her to the rooftop, got down on one knee, then pulled out her texts with her gym buddy and said loudly, actually, I'm not proposing. I'm here to say goodbye in front of everyone you tried to impress. This happened 3 weeks ago and I'm still processing it. My girlfriend Danielle and I had been together for 3 years. I've been dropping engagement hints constantly, showing me rings, talking about weddings. I've been secretly saving for months, even picked out a ring. The plan was to propose at her company's rooftop holiday party. She kept mentioning how romantic it would be with the City Lights and all her co workers there. But last Tuesday changed everything. I came home early from my hospital shift. I heard Danielle on Facetime upstairs laughing. Melissa, he's definitely doing it at the party tomorrow. He's been acting all secretive. I stopped on the stairs. That's exciting. Are you ready? Her sister asked. Here's the thing, I'm saying no right in front of everyone. My blood went cold. Danielle, what? Why? He needs a reality check. Plus, you know Anthony from Crossfit. He just started his own business. Way more ambitious than a nurse. Anthony, the guy she'd been training with three nights a week. You're really going to humiliate him at your work party? Picture this, all my co workers watching. He gets Down on one knee and I just say sorry. But no, maybe he'll understand. He can't coast through life helping sick people all day. They both giggled. I quietly went to my car and sat there for an hour. That night, Danielle was all over me. Babe, I love you so much. All I could think about was her planning my destruction. Wednesday morning, her phone buzzed with a text from Anthony. Can't wait to celebrate tomorrow. She'd left it unlocked. I scrolled through their messages. So, so tomorrow's the big day, Anthony had written. Yep, poor guy has no idea what's coming. You sure you wanna do this at work? Seems harsh. He needs this wake up call. Besides, I'll need someone to comfort me after. Always here for you. Can't wait to see his face. Weeks of messages like this. I took screenshots. That afternoon, Danielle called me bouncing with excitement. Tom, I can't wait for tonight. Everyone's going to be there. My boss, the whole team. It's going to be perfect. Perfect for my public destruction. Can't wait, I said. The party was on the 40th floor with incredible downtown views. Danielle Network introduced me as my boyfriend, Tom. He's a nurse. Like she was embarrassed. Anthony showed up around eight PM, big guy, Crossfit shirt, giving me this smug look. Around 9:30, Danielle got antsy, checking her phone constantly. The view is incredible. So romantic with these lights. It really is beautiful. Perfect setting for something. Special to happen. You're absolutely right. Could you get everyone's attention? I have something to say. Her eyes lit up. She called out everyone. Tom has something to share. The room quieted. Her boss smiled. Anthony pulled out his phone. Probably to record my humiliation. I got down.

I woke up to my teenage daughter Kayla's piercing screams. I ran into her bedroom and couldn't believe what I saw. She was completely bald, her blonde hair scattered across her pillowcase. She was sobbing, telling me her little sister Reese must have shaved her head while she was sleeping. She stumbled to the bathroom mirror and started screaming even loud when she saw her reflection. Prom was in 8 hours and she was supposed to be a shoe in for Queen. Now it was ruined. Where's Reese, I demanded. And my husband found her sitting on her own bed in her unicorn pajamas with his electric razor on her nightstand. Reese, what did you do? I asked, trying not to scream while Kayla sobbed in the bathroom. I had to stop her from going to prom, Reese said in that small voice she uses when she knows she's in trouble but thinks she did the right thing. This was my baby, who still crawled into Kayla's bed during thunderstorms. The same little girl who Kayla taught to ride a bike last summer, the one who followed her big sister everywhere, asking endless questions about everything. I couldn't believe she would sabotage her sister's big night like this. Before I could respond, the doorbell rang. Kayla's boyfriend, Steven, let himself in like he always did on Saturday mornings. He came Upstairs calling about corsage colours and stopped dead when he saw Kayla's bald head. What the hell happened to your hair, he asked and quickly rearranged his face into concern. Baby, don't cry. We can fix this. Maybe get you a nice wig. You'll still be the prettiest girl there. Kayla was crying harder now. Steven pulled her against him while glaring at me like this was my fault. Did Reese do this? I always said that kid was weird. This is assault, Missus Adams. Reese appeared in the bathroom doorway still in her unicorn pajamas. I cut off all her hair so she couldn't go to prom with you because you're mean to her, Reese, I yelled. But she kept talking in that determined little kid voice. You hurt my sister all the time, Kevin. I see the purple marks on her arms where you grabbed her too hard. The bathroom went silent. Steven laughed, but it sounded forced. Kids make up crazy stories. Missus Adams, tell her, Kayla, tell your mom how good I am to you. Kayla wouldn't look at anyone. I felt ice spreading through my chest. I took pictures on Mommy's phone. When Kayla was sleeping, Reese said, her voice getting stronger. You push her into walls. You hit her tummy where nobody can see. Then you buy her presents after so she won't tell. I pulled out my phone with shaking hands and opened my photos. There they were, close UPS of Kayla's arms. With finger shaped bruises, her ribs with dark purple marks. I felt my stomach drop. Oh, my god, I whispered. Kayla, is this true? Steven's face was getting red. Those could be from anything she plays.

Call your mom right now. I looked up, confused because Mr Bax never talked to individual kids unless someone was throwing things or starting fights. He'd been driving Route 47 for like 10 years and barely acknowledged any of us existed. Why? I pulled out my earbuds and walked closer to the front. His knuckles were white from gripping the steering wheel so hard. Just call her right now. His voice had this urgent edge that made my stomach flip. I, I fumbled for my phone while other kids started complaining about why we weren't moving. We were stopped three blocks before my usual stop on Cedar Lane. Just sitting there with the engine idling. My mom's phone went straight to voicemail. I tried again. Same thing. She's not answering. Mr Bax was staring at something in his side mirror. And when I turned to look, I saw a black sedan that had been following us for the last few turns. Try your dad or anyone else in your family now. I was really freaking out because, but drivers don't care about your family unless something is seriously wrong. I called my dad and got voicemail again. The black car was still there, just sitting behind us with its engine running. Through the tinted windows, I could see the outline of someone in the driver's seat. Mr Bax, what's going on? My Voice came out higher than I meant it to. He reached for his radio and spoke quietly into it. Base, this is bus 47. I need immediate assistance at Cedar and 5th. Possible situation with suspicious vehicle following my route. The dispatcher's voice crackled back, asking for details, but Mister Bax kept his responses vague. The other kids on the bus were getting restless and starting to ask questions. Jace from the back yelled, yo, why aren't we moving? I got practice. Mr Bax ignored him and kept watching that black car in his mirror. Kip, I need you to listen very carefully when I tell you. I want you to duck down below the window level and stay there until I say it's safe. My heart started pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. Are we in danger? I whispered. But before he could answer, answer, the black sedan pulled up alongside our bus. The windows were so dark I couldn't see inside, but I felt like someone was staring right at me. Mr Bax's hand moved to something under his dashboard that looked like a panic button. Everyone sit down and be quiet, he announced to the whole bus in his serious voice. The car kept pace with us as we started moving again. Staying right next to my window, I pressed myself against the seat back, trying to make myself smaller. Other kids were craning their necks to see what was happening, but something About the whole situation felt wrong in a way I couldn't explain. My phone finally rang and it was my mom, but she sounded weird, really weird. Tip, honey, where are you right now? Her voice was shaky, like she'd been crying. I'm on the bus. We're running late because she cut me off. Listen to me very carefully. Do not come home today. Go to Aunt Pip's house instead. I'll pick you up there later. In the background, I could hear men's voices talking, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. Mom, what's wrong? Why can't I come home? The line went quiet for a few seconds. Then she whispered, just trust me, baby, don't come to the house. Call ended abruptly, leaving me staring at my phone in panic. Mr Bax was watching me in the rearview mirror. What did she say? I told him about going to my aunt's house instead. And his face got this grim expression. The black car was still following us and now there was a second one behind it. Change of plans, kid. We're going straight to the police station. He made a sharp turn away from.

The call came through my commanding officer. Your son committed felony assault at his father's wedding. You need to get home now. I was on a base in Germany and hadn't seen my boys in 8 months. Now my teenage son who stopped wrestling because he hated hurting people was facing charges for brutalizing a woman at the altar. After an 18 hour emergency flight, I, I headed to my ex husband's house where my son was. The wife's dark blood was still stained by the driveway. I rang the doorbell. My ex husband Conrad answered. His face twisted with rage. We're pressing charges. I'm not taking anyone's side until I see both, I said. Pushing past him. The living room was a tribunal. Conrad's parents on the couch, his brother Potter by the fireplace, his sister Fenn in the corner, the bride's parents standing like guard dogs. And in the center the bride Lauren with a splinted nose, two black eyes, bandages across her face. She he was crying, dabbing her eyes carefully around the swelling. And there surrounded by this mob sat my son, my 14 year old who refused to kill insects because he could have been born an ant, who taught his little stepbrother origami. He sat perfectly straight, chin raised, looking me dead in the eyes with zero regret. He looked proud of what he Did your son destroyed our family, Conrad spat. Look what he did to her face. Lauren sobbed harder. He's an animal. They're trying him as an adult, right? Grandpa shook his head in disgust. I looked at my son. His knuckles were still bruised and swollen. There seemed to be no real excuse. But then I asked for his side of the story. He looked around the room slowly taking in every face. Then he spoke. Voice clear. You wanna know the truth? She's been molesting me for 6 months. That's why I did it. My world stopped, but the room exploded instantly. Liar. Disgusting. How dare you. Lauren's face shifted for just a sec and before she wailed louder. He's making it up. I've been nothing but loving. Her mother stepped forward pointing at my son. You evil little. But her father grabbed her arm, his face pale like he'd been expecting this. In the midst of all the chaos, my son pulled out his phone and swiped to his hidden photos, she said. Fourteen year old boys always want it said. I should be grateful. I saw the images over his shoulder and my stomach turned. Conrad's hands were shaking as he stared at the screen. Those could be anyone could have, but his voice was hollow like he was reading a script. He didn't believe Lauren tried to snatch the phone. Those are out of context. I, it was just she stopped realizing. She just admitted they Were real. My son stood up, voice shaking with rage. Dad, I told you three months ago, you said she's just being affectionate. Conrad started stuttering. I didn't. I thought, Grandpa, you laughed. Lucky boy. Wish I had that problem at 14. Grandpa's face went from red to white. He looked at Lauren, then at his grandson, and something crumbled in his expression. Aunt Fenn, you told me, don't be dramatic. Fenn was backing toward the door, tears streaming. Oh, god. Oh, god. I thought you were just Uncle Potter. You said I should be grateful Potter had his head in his hands. Jesus Christ. I was joking. I didn't know she was actually grandma. You said boys can't be great by women. Grandma collapsed into the couch, rosary beads in her hands, whispering prayers. Every single one of you told me to shut up about it. Lauren's parents were having a whispered argument. Her father hissed. Not again, Patricia. You said she was better. The word again hung in the air. But that's not why I hit her. My son cut through. Everyone immediately froze. What do you.

My boyfriend Eric had this problem. He couldn't put his phone down ever. Like the guy would literally text while I was talking to him at dinner. I'd catch him scrolling Instagram in the bathroom, dming random girls on Snapchat, always saying he was just networking for his music career. We've been together almost 4 years. We lived together, shared custody of our golden retriever, Benny, even had matching coffee mugs. I thought we were solid. Sure, Eric spent way too much time on his phone, but I figured all guys our age were like that. Then one Tuesday night, he came home from work acting weird, wouldn't look at me, kept checking his phone every 5 seconds, had this stupid grin on his face. I asked what was up and he said we needed to talk. I met someone, he said, still staring at his phone. Her name is Stacy. She just gets me, you know, like we talk for hours every night about deep stuff, things you never ask me about. I was confused. What do you mean you met someone where Snapchat, but it's not like that. We have this connection. She understands my music, my dreams. She actually listens to me. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. He was dumping me for some girl he'd never met? Some random person online? Eric, that's insane. You don't even know this person. But he was already packing his stuff. Said Stacy was helping him become a better version of himself, that she believed in his potential. That I was just holding him back from his true happiness. Whole thing was so bizarre. I didn't even fight it. I just watched him stuff his clothes into trash bags like our 4 years together meant nothing. But here's the thing about Eric. He was careless with his phone. I remembered seeing this girl Snapchat handle a few weeks earlier when he left it unlocked on the counter. So after he moved out, I got curious. I made a fake account and searched for her.

Yeah, like an hour ago. Why? He dropped to his knees right there on the kitchen floor. For a second, I thought he was joking, but then he started dry heaving into this. Think she ate it? The whole thing? His voice cracked. He ran out to the bathroom, slamming the door. That's when Delilah burst through the front door, still in her dental hygienist scrubs. She must have left work early. Where's Killian? She asked, breathless. He texted to call 9 1 1 and something about you eating the last slice. Delilah pounded on the bathroom door. Killian, baby, what's wrong? He came out, eyes red, and showed her something. Delilah's face went from worried to devastated in seconds. No, she whispered. No, no, no! My phone buzzed. It was our landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry. Rent can wait this month. My stomach cramped suddenly, sharp enough to double me over the chocolate cake. Another wave of nausea hit, and I barely made it to the kitchen sink. My roommate Damien rubbed my back, which was so out of character, I'd have laughed if I wasn't puking. He's been waiting two years to eat that cake, Killian muttered, looking at Delilah, who was now sitting on the floor, crying her eyes out. Two years for what? I gasped between heaves. Nobody answered. My phone rang. It was my mom. Hey. I'm so disappointed. In you. How could you do this? Hung up before I could ask what she was talking about. We need to go to the hospital, Killian said. Now. What? Why? It's just food poisoning. Delilah stood up, her face pale. It's not food poisoning. Please, just trust me. We need to go now. Killian was already grabbing his keys. The cramping was getting worse. In the car, Delilah wouldn't even look at me. Killian kept checking his phone and wincing at whatever he saw. What was in that cake? I asked again, starting to panic. The pain was spreading. Lila finally spoke, her voice hollow. My future just. We'll deal with it at the hospital, Killian said. At the ER, Killian ran ahead to talk to the intake nurse. I couldn't hear what he was saying, but she looked shocked and waved us through immediately. That's when I knew something was really, really wrong. Delilah looked like she might cry or scream or both. A doctor appeared with a portable X ray machine. We need to check your stomach contents immediately. For food poisoning? He exchanged a look with Killian and Delilah. Not exactly. Let's just see what we find. A nurse started prepping an I V. And any allergies I should know about? She asked. Medications? Latex. She paused, looking at her clipboard. Reactions to platinum or white? Gold? No, I answered, completely confused. They made everyone leave the room while they X rayed my abdomen. The doctor studied The image on his tablet. Zooming in on something. Killian's mom appeared in the doorway.

And honestly, watching them at the funeral was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So my brother Jake and his wife Kelly show up to our house that morning. Before we head to the church, first thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral, and she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her, but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. The cemetery. She literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would mention How hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I know. Now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce, pregnant lady coming through or, baby on board needs to pee. There were, like, 30 people there grieving, and she's treating it like her personal pregnancy announcement party. But then she crossed the line. Rachel was sitting

Last year I launched a cleaning company after saving 15 k working 3 jobs. My reward, a lawsuit from my own parents and 50% ownership because we raised you so we own half your success. I've been grinding since 16, worked through college, paid my own tuition, lived in a basement apartment with 2 roommates, never asked for help. Meanwhile, my brother Marcus got everything handed to him. They bankrolled his failed food truck venture that lasted 6 months, covered his crypto losses when he dropped 20 k on some scam coin, even paid his UI lawyer twice. When he moved back home at 28 with no job and no plan, they remodeled the entire basement for him. New carpet, fresh paint, gaming setup included. When my business hit 200 k revenue in year 1, suddenly I became the villain. Their lawyer sent a certified letter demanding I add them as co owners with full profit sharing rights, give Marcus a management position at 80 k annual salary despite zero experience and pay 30 k in emotional damages for excluding family from my success. I laughed and filed it in my trash folder. That's when the real harassment started. Mom posted on Facebook, some children forget who sacrificed for them. Success should be shared with family not hoarded. Disappointed in the values we apparently failed to teach. Within hours, relatives I hadn't seen in years. Were commenting. Marcus wrote, greed ruins people. Family means nothing anymore, I guess. My aunt started a group chat with 47 family members titled The Situation where everyone discussed my cousins who never worked a day in their lives were suddenly experts on business ethics and family loyalty. My grandmother called crying saying I was breaking her heart and tearing the family apart. Dad started showing up at my client site telling business owners I was unstable and unreliable. One client actually called to verify mom sent emails to my entire contact list claiming I'd stolen the business idea from Marcus and owed him compensation. Marcus posted Instagram Stories outside my apartment talking about how blood means nothing to some people. They actually hired a lawyer and filed court dates set for three months out. I spent those months collecting evidence, every single piece of documentation I could find. They arrives. They showed up with Marcus, my aunt and two cousins for moral support, all wearing matching navy suits like they coordinated a family uniform. Mom carried a photo album. Dad had a folder 2 inches thick. Their lawyer clearly uncomfortable, began presenting evidence. Childhood photos of me opening birthday presents, family vacation pictures from 2008, even my kindergarten graduation program. They created an itemized spreadsheet of every expense. Races, 40 $200. Little League, $800. Summer camp, 40 five hundred dollars. School supplies, 20. Three hundred dollars. Car insurance when I was 17, 1 $800. 23 years of receipts totaling $67,000. Mom testify I that starting a business without including family was a betrayal of everything we taught him about loyalty. Dad claimed he'd given me valuable advice at dinner once that directly LED to my success. Therefore, he deserved equity.

So during the pandemic I got really into making wine. Like, really into it. Before that I hadn't touched brewing in maybe 15 years. But when we all got locked down and the one decent liquor store we could get to close for like a year straight, I figured why not start up again? I had the time and honestly everyone was going crazy without anything to drink. Started small with some basic fruit wines using whatever I could find locally. Apples, berries, anything that would ferment. Pretty soon I was making mead too, and even figured out how to malt grain to make beer since the nearest homebrew shop was literally thousands of miles away. Yeah, we lived in a weird spot. Anyway, my stuff turned out pretty decent. Clear, balanced, strong enough to get the job done. Nothing fancy, but it worked. Word got around fast because nobody had any other options. People started trading me things for bottles. my neighbor gave me fresh eggs every week for a case of apple wine. Another guy fixed my fence for some mead. It was honestly a pretty sweet setup and kept everyone happy during a really boring time. But this one guy in our group, let's call him Brian, absolutely hated that I was doing this. He made wine too, but his was honestly not great. It was drinkable. I Guess, but nothing special. The thing that really got under his skin was that people actually wanted mine. At parties, everyone would drink my stuff and his bottles would just sit there mostly untouched. His wife would always try to hype up his wine, too, which made it even more awkward. Brian started making comments every single time we hung out. If I brought wine to someone's house, he'd make a face and say something like, oh, you brought the battery acid? Or trying to poison us again, huh? At first I laughed it off because whatever, dude, more for everyone else. But he kept going. Every gathering, every tasting night, every time someone mentioned my wine, he had something negative to say. His wife backed him up too, which I thought was weird. Like she'd agree and say things like, yeah, Brian's wine is so much smoother, even when she'd barely touched his own bottles. It became this whole thing where they'd team up to trash talk my brewing whenever they got the chance. One night we organized a big tasting event at someone's house. Basically, everyone brought whatever they've been making or bought, and we'd all sample and talk about it. It was supposed to be chill and fun. I brought a few different batches I've been working on, including one I was actually pretty proud of. Brian showed up with his wife and immediately started his usual routine, but this time I was ready see a few Weeks before this, he'd asked me for some tips on his brewing process because one of his batches had turned out especially bad. I helped him out, and he ended up with a decent bottle for once. He gave me one to try, and honestly, it wasn't terrible. I kept it. So at this tasting, I poured everyone samples from different unmarked bottles. I labeled them with numbers instead of names, so people could judge them blind without knowing who made what. Brian

So my whole family had been using my Amazon Prime account for like three years. My mom, my sister Ashley, my Uncle Rick. Even my grandma somehow figured out how to order stuff. I was paying for it because I actually use Amazon all the time for work stuff and groceries, but they were just leeching off it. The breaking point happened two weeks ago. I check my account and see 17 packages coming to different addresses. 17! My sister ordered a whole workout set she'll never use. My mom got some fancy face cream that cost 60 bucks, and my Uncle Rick ordered a drone he definitely doesn't need. But the worst part was my cousin Blake ordered a gaming chair that cost $400. I called Blake and asked him what the hell he was thinking. He just laughed and said it's not his problem. I gave everyone access, said if I didn't want people using it, I shouldn't have shared the password. This kid just graduated high school and acts like he runs the world. So I called my mom and told her everyone needed to chip in for prime or get their own accounts. She got all dramatic and said family should help each other out. She reminded me how she used to buy me clothes when I was younger. I told her that was literally her job as a parent and not the same thing at all. Then Ashley calls me crying, saying she can't afford her own prime account because she's saving for a wedding. I reminded her that her wedding is in two years and she just spent $300 on workout clothes she returned last month. She said I was being petty and that it's only like $10 a month split between everyone. I did the math. If everyone chipped in 10 bucks, that would actually cover prime and give me extra money. But when I suggested this in our family group chat, suddenly everyone had excuses. My mom said she's on a fixed income. Ashley said she's saving for the wedding. Rick said he barely uses it anyway, which is a lie because he ordered protein powder just yesterday. The final straw was when my grandma called me, confused about why her soap order got cancelled. Turns out my account got flagged for suspicious activity. Because there were so many different addresses, Amazon temporarily locked my account and I couldn't order my medication refills. That's when I snapped. I changed the password and removed everyone's.

Did we hide in my ex's tattoo when everyone realised how horrible he was? I was cleaning my station at the tattoo shop ready to go home when out of nowhere I heard that voice, that nauseating, too familiar laugh that used to make my heart race for all the wrong reasons. Nate, my ex, who told me I was too clingy when I caught him texting three other girls. My anxiety was exhausting. When I asked why he kept hiding his phone, I tried my best to hide myself and thankfully he just walked by. But I heard everything. Babe, matching tattoos are so cringe. How will I even know I'll still like you? The girl's voice was small but hopeful. I just thought it would be romantic, he laughed. You're lucky I even came to look with you. It's always you with your dumb woman ideas. My coworker Jacqueline's eyes met mine. She knew my history. She'd held me through the breakdown six months ago when I found out Nate had been cheating our entire two year relationship. That's when Jaclyn walked over all professional smiles and I saw that look in her eyes. She was up to something. Jaclyn started showing them designs, but after a few minutes, I watched her go back to grab her phone. 30 seconds later, I got a notification from our group chat. Remember that one idea we had? It's go time. Within minutes, our entire crew was involved. Everybody Started getting excited, but I didn't know what this idea they were talking about was. Jaclyn pulled out her tablet, showing them some thing that made the girlfriend immediately gasped. Oh, my god, it's perfect. Nate barely glanced up from his phone. Yeah, whatever makes you happy, babe. Jacqueline's face was completely professional. I saw her jaw clench, fighting something. She excused herself for a moment and practically sprinted to the back room where I was hiding. The second the door closed, she collapsed against the wall, tears streaming down her face, trying not to laugh. I can't go back out there. You have to see this design. But before she could show me, Jade burst in, mascara running. I just told them it's eternal love, sacred geometry, he said. Whatever. I'm going to pee myself. We had to take turns going back out, each of us needing breaks to compose ourselves. The girlfriend was glowing, texting her entire family pictures of the design. We were all praying none of them would notice. And by some miracle, they didn't. They decided she'd go first. Jacqueline took her to the chair while Nate waited up front. And that's when things got almost impossible. Jacqueline was doing the stencil, explaining something about special angle calculations for maximum symbolic connection. And the girlfriend was eating it up. Jacqueline's hand was shaking, not from nerves, from suppressed laughter. She had to excuse herself twice. When it was Nate's turn, our senior artist, Nick, took Over while I watched from the back with the other girls, all of us hold behind the half wall like kids watching something they shouldn't. Nate spent the entire session on Facetime with somebody talking about a girl from the gym. Yeah, bro. She's been all over my DMs. Might hit that this weekend. You feel me? His girlfriend was in the bathroom. We kept poking our heads around the corner and every time we'd see Nick's shoulders shaking. All of us still in disbelief of what his tattoo said. When both tattoos were done, they stood together, wrists touching and the girlfriend squealed. It's perfect.

So I got five boxes of those fiber one bars. That's all I've been eating. Nothing else? Just fiber bars. I couldn't the day after that. I did the same thing. I ate six more boxes of fiber bars. Only I didn't that day, either. I was getting very worried. I take at least one on a normal day, but I could feel the fat burning off my body from all the fiber. I didn't the day after that, either.

I used to fake sick at least once a month. Nothing dramatic, just your classic ugh, my stomach hurts routine. I'd shuffle into the kitchen, wrap myself in a blanket, throw in a little cough, and wait for my mom to sigh and say, fine, but no video games. She always fell for it. Or maybe she just didn't care enough to argue. This time felt no different. It was a Thursday. I had a math test I wasn't ready for, and zero energy to sit through Mr. Danner's forty five minute rant about fractions, so I pulled out the old stomachache move. My mom was already halfway out the door for work, so she just nodded and left. I grabbed a bowl of cereal, flopped on to the couch, and turned on some cartoons, already feeling like I'd won. Dad works nights, so he usually sleeps through most of the day and the house stays quiet, but around 10:00 I heard his door open. I muted the TV and listened. He walked past the living room without noticing me, phone in hand, and stepped out into the garage. Didn't think much of it at first, figured maybe he was calling in sick or trying to get a refund for something. But then I heard his voice through the wall. And it wasn't his normal voice. It was quiet, tired, flat. I can't do this anymore, he said. I paused. I Tried. I really tried. But I feel like I don't even know my family anymore. I come home and everything's just cold. I tiptoed down the hall, heart suddenly racing. The garage door was cracked open, just like always, and I crouched beside it. I know this isn't what we wanted, but it's where we are now, he said. Every day I feel like I'm just pretending. Pretending to be fine. Pretending to be a good husband, a good dad. My stomach twisted. This time for real. I mean, look at him, he said. He doesn't even like me. He doesn't talk to me unless he wants something. And when he does, it's just one word. Answers. I don't even know who he is anymore. My throat went dry. I look at him and all I can think is, what happened? What did I do wrong? When did he start looking at me like I was a stranger? There was silence then. I know it's awful, but sometimes I wonder if I'd be happier alone. Just starting over. Somewhere quiet. Somewhere nobody knows me. My chest felt like it caved in. I haven't said anything to her yet, he continued. I don't even know if I will. But I can't keep going like this. I'm exhausted. I backed away from the door before I could hear more. I stumbled into the bathroom and locked the door behind me, sat on the edge of the tub and stared at the floor. He didn't know I was home. He didn't know I was listening. And he definitely didn't know I had just realized something I could never unhear. My dad didn't just feel lost. He felt lost because of me. I stayed in the bathroom for over an hour, just trying to breathe. When I finally came out, he was back in his room. I crept into mine, got under the covers, and didn't move for the rest the day. Later that night, he knocked on my door. How's your stomach? He asked. Fine. I mumbled. Need anything? No. He stood there for a second longer, then said, okay, let me know. I said nothing.

I had to choose. I'm at work on a Tuesday morning when my wife texts having contractions. Think this is it. Meet you at Memorial Hospital. I'm grabbing my car keys when my phone rings. It's my twin sister and she's sobbing. My water just broke. I'm scared. I'm headed to Valencia Hospital. Please come. I freeze in the parking lot holding the phone up to my ear. My wife is 39 weeks pregnant with our first baby. My sister is only 34 weeks, making this a high risk pregnancy. And her boyfriend left her two months ago after they found out the baby has down syndrome. The hospitals are 45 minutes apart in opposite directions. I stand there like an idiot while the two most important women in my life need me in two different places. I drive toward my sister first because she's alone and high risk. I call my wife from the car. When I tell her, she's crying but says she understands. My sister texts, contractions getting stronger. Nurse says I'm 4 cm dilated. I think back to when my sister held my hand through our dad's death when we were 16. She's been there through my depression, my divorce from my first marriage, everything. She chose me as her birth partner months ago when her boyfriend bailed. My wife texts, contractions five minutes apart now. Then I'm scared, too. Then we promised We'd do this together. My wife has an anxiety disorder and she's been planning this birth for three years. The playlist wrote letters to the baby. We practice breathing exercises every night. I'm driving when my breathing starts coming in faster and my hands are shaking so bad, I swerve into the other lane. A truck horn blares and I yank the wheel back, nearly going off the road. I have to pull over on the highway shoulder just so I can gasp for air. Full panic attack, head and hands on the steering wheel trying to breathe. My phone explodes with calls. I answer them one by one. My mother in law is screaming, we just got to the hospital. Where are you? How dare you leave her right now? My father in law texts, get back here now. Man up and support your family. Then my mom calls, we're getting on a plane but that's five hours away. You need to step up as her big brother. Your sister has nobody. The baby might not survive. My dad texts, blood comes first. Your wife has family, your sister has no one. I sit there for a moment longer breathing. Then I call both hospitals. My sister's nurse says she's asking for you. She's terrified. My wife's nurse told me she's progressing fast. Where are you? My phone's at 5% battery from all the calls at this point. The last thing I hear is my mother in law saying If you're not here when that baby comes, don't bother coming home. My phone dies right there in my hands, still vibrating with another call coming in. I choose to go to my sister because she's alone and at higher risk. I speed toward her hospital, crying the whole way. I run into the emergency room, asking for her delivery room. The nurse looks confused.

I told a teenage girl she was gonna get assaulted working the night shift at a truck stop and she kicked me out for harassment. I've been driving trucks for 12 years now and I've seen people, men especially, at their darkest late at night on the road. I started driving trucks after my daughter was born because it paid better than warehouse work. My route takes me from Dallas up through Arkansas and into Tennessee. There's this one gas station that I try to avoid like a plague. It's one of those places where the parking lot lights are half broken and there's always sketchy stuff going down. Some nightmare on Elm Street shite last time I was there some tweaker tried to sell me a chainsaw at 3 in the morning. But sometimes you need gas and it's the only stop for 40 miles. This it happened about six months ago. I pulled in around 11 at night and noticed something was different right away. The old guy who usually work nights wasn't behind the counter. Instead there was this young girl who couldn't have been older than 19. She had bright purple hair and enough piercings to make her head explode in an MRI, full sleeve tattoos on both arms too. She was reading a textbook when I walked in so I figured she was a student. I grabbed an energy drink and beef jerky and Went up to pay. You new here, I asked while she rang me up. Yeah, started last week, she said, without looking up from scanning. They had a help wanted sign in the hours work with my class schedule. My stomach dropped a little. This girl had no idea what she'd signed up for. So I told her very respectfully, listen, I don't mean to pry, but you might want to find somewhere else to work. This place gets rough espe actually at night. She finally looked up at me and her face went hard. I can take care of myself, thanks. That annoyed me a little, but I needed her to understand. I'm sure you can, but the drivers that come through here aren't your average cost. Some of these guys have been on the road for days straight. They get weird ideas in their heads, especially when they see a young woman working alone. Is that supposed to be a threat? Her voice got sharp. No, I'm trying to warn you. I've been stopping here for years and I've seen some bad stuff go down. You need to at least keep some heat under the counter for Protection. Get out. She pointed at the door. I don't need some random trucker man explaining danger to me. I that I can handle myself. I don't even know what man'splaining is. I said, look, I have a daughter about your age and I'd want someone to tell her before I Could even say anything else. She screamed out, before I call the cops and report you for harassment, I held up my hands and backed away. Fine, I tried. Some people just won't listen when you're trying to help them. I paid for my stuff and left without another word. Back in my truck, I popped open the energy drink and did my usual safety check. Tires looked good. Load was cure. I was just about to pull out when I remembered I'd promised my wife I'd grab diapers on the way home. My wife just had another baby girl. She goes through them like crazy and we were almost out. I sat there for a minute debating whether to go back in. The girl clearly didn't want me there, but I really needed those diapers. I waited about five minutes to let things cool down, then headed back inside. The store was empty. That purple haired girl behind the counter, I hoped for the best and told myself maybe she was in the bathroom or on break. Then I heard.

The bride stopped mid pose, her photographer looked confused, and about 30 wedding guests turned to stare at my three year old daughter, Emma, standing by the playground swings. I was mortified. Emma had this habit of saying random things loudly at the worst possible moments, but this was next level embarrassing. Emma, honey, let's go play on the slides, I whispered, trying to drag her away from the wedding party, but she wasn't having it. She broke free from my grip and marched right up to the bride, tugging on her dress. Lady, don't marry the mean man, Emma said, pointing directly at the groom. He's gonna hurt you. Everyone went dead silent. The groom's face went red and he started walking toward us looking angry. Hey, what kind of kids says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just three and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve. My mommy had marks like that. When the bad man lived with us, she cried at night, too. Just like you smell like tears under your makeup. My heart stopped. This kid had been through way too much for her age, but she developed This weird ability to spot things adults tried to hide. When my ex was still around, Emma would always know when I'd been crying, even if I thought I'd covered it up perfectly.

When I was 14, I had been begging my parents for a service dog for months. My anxiety had gotten so bad that I couldn't even walk into school without hyperventilating in the parking lot. My therapist told them it would help, but they kept saying no. Dad always said dogs were too much work and too expensive. Mom claimed I was just exaggerating my anxiety to skip school. Dad would joke around dinner, if you're too anxious to go to school, how are you gonna walk a dog every day? So when my cousin Jake called and said his friend couldn't keep their Labrador mix Scout anymore, I said yes without asking. Scout was already trained for emotional support stuff. I met Jake at the park that Tuesday and walked home with this golden brown dog who immediately started following me around like we've known each other forever. My parents lost their minds. When I walked through the door, mom started yelling about responsibility and vet bills. Dad was pacing around the kitchen saying I couldn't just bring home random animals. We're so mad they could barely speak to me during dinner. But then dad got this idea. I could keep Scout for exactly one week to prove I couldn't handle it. He even pulled out this little blue notebook and started writing down everything I did wrong. Day 1, he wrote that I forgot to fill the water. Bowl before school. Day 2, he noted that Scout tracked MUD on the carpet. But something weird started happening the first night Scout was there. I didn't have my usual 3:00am panic attack where I'd end up crying under my blanket. Instead, when I started feeling that familiar tightness in my chest around midnight, Scout jumped onto my bed and put his head right on my chest. His weight was warm and heavy, and somehow my breathing just slowed down. The next morning at breakfast, mom asked why I looked so rested. I told her about Scout helping me sleep, but she just rolled her eyes and said it was probably just the excitement of getting what I wanted. Day three was when things got real. I had this math tutoring session with Mr Peterson that usually left me in tears because I'd get so anxious about making mistakes. This time I brought Scout with me. Mr Peterson seemed annoyed at first, but then something crazy happened. Every time I started bouncing my leg or my breathing got fast.

It's time to declare a winner. So I married into the Callahan family three years ago. And let me tell you, they made it clear from day 1 that I wasn't good enough for their precious son, Tyler. His mom would make these little comments about my community college degree while she went to some fancy state school. His older brother Jeff kept calling me the temp at family dinners. Real cute stuff. Last month, I was looking for batteries in Tyler's dad's garage for the TV remote. I opened this random drawer and found a literal notebook, like an actual spiral notebook with the pool written on the front and marker. I'm nosy, so obviously I opened it. Turns out the entire Callahan family had been betting money on when Tyler and I would split up since our wedding day. His mom bet we wouldn't make it past six months, put down 50 bucks. His dad gave us a year. Another fifty F that jerk. Bet we'd be done before our first anniversary and dropped $100 on it. Even Tyler's Aunt Rachel, who's always super nice to my face, bet on 18 months. Pot was up to $470. I took pictures of every single page with my phone, hands literally shaking. Then I put the notebook back exactly where I found it and went home. Didn't say a word to Tyler that night. Just kept smiling through dinner while my brain was exploding. Here's the thing, though. Tyler's actually a good husband. He's nothing like his family. He always takes my side, calls out his mom's rude comments and genuinely loves me. But this wasn't about him. This was about them. So I started planning. Our third anniversary was coming up in two weeks and the whole family was throwing us a party at their house. Perfect timing. I went to this print shop downtown and got the notebook pages blown up into a massive poster, like 3 feet by 4 feet, spent 60 bucks on it. Then I ordered a custom cake from this bakery that does photo cakes. Put the first page of the Bedding Pool right on top of the frosting. Another $40 anniversary party day comes. The whole family is there, probably 30 people in their backyard. Everyone's acting so fake nice, hugging me, saying how happy they are we made it this far.

You don't get its silly perks. I work at one of those indoor trampoline parks where parents drop their kids off and pretend they don't exist for two hours. The job comes with some pretty sweet perks that nobody talks about. Free access to the trampolines after hours, employee discounts on birthday parties. And the best part, I get to eat leftover pizza from kids parties that parents never bothered to pick up. Plus, my coworkers are actually cool. We're all college kids or people between real jobs, so we just vibe and make the best of it. Enter Bryce, my new manager who got hired three months ago. This guy clearly thinks he's running some Fortune 500 company. Instead of watching kids bounce around on trampolines. First week on the job, he called a staff meeting to discuss professional development and brand image. Talking about a place where the main job requirement is knowing how to work a cash register and occasionally telling kids not to do backflips off the foam pit walls, Bryce started implementing all these new rules. No phones during shifts, even when it's dead empty on Tuesday afternoons. No talking to co workers unless it's work related. No eating the leftover party food because it looks unprofessional. And the worst part, he started scheduling mandatory team building exercises on our days off. But what really set me off was when he started making comments about how my job wasn't real. Work and how I should be grateful for the opportunity to gain work experience. And customer service. Dude literally said this while I was cleaning puke out of the foam pit because some kid ate too much cake before jumping around last week. He really crossed the line. I've been working there for 8 months longer than anyone except the assistant manager. Katie. This family came in for their kids birthday party and everything was going fine until their cake fell off the table. The mom was freaking out. The birthday kid was crying and I felt bad for them. So I offered to comp their pizza order since we mess up food order sometimes anyway and usually just eat the mistakes. It was like 20 bucks, no big deal. The family was super grateful. The kid cheered up and everyone had a good time.

Years later, he is devastated to learn what happened to his son. I had a baby boy when I was 16. Yes, I know what that sounds like. No, we weren't careful. Judge me all you want. I've dealt with that for years. Mike was my boyfriend then. And when I found out about my pregnancy, he did a disappearing act with help from his family. Something. Something. Future college star. Something. My parents were always blunt. What happened next was my choice. After a lot of thinking and deciding, termination just wasn't for me. So I chose to give up the baby for adoption. My parents knew a super sweet couple that was looking to adopt. We met and I knew they were the right people. This turned from a teen mistake to almost a surrogacy. I started homeschooling to finish my education and to have a rest. Adoptive parents were with me for everything and even paid for most of the medical costs. The adoptive mother was a teacher, so she helped me with my school work and prepared me for college. They were present for the birth and I refused to hold the baby. Instead, his actual mother did and it was just right. I've stayed in the baby's life in a distant position as a special aunt. Well, he's no longer a baby and he knows who I am. But his mom is the same woman. Who raised him and I continue to be his special aunt. Only change is now he knows who to call if he needs a kidney. His sense of humor is like mine. Go figure. We talk maybe once in a blue moon, which in all honesty is the best. He's happy and I don't regret giving him up to have a happy life. For my part, I got married six years ago. My husband Aaron was divorced on good terms with Bella. They have two children together, a boy who is 16 and a girl who is 19. Aaron made it clear since we began dating that his kids approval was important and that Bella was part of his life forever, not as a spouse, but as a friend and mother to his children. I also told Bella and him about my teen pregnancy to begin with. My stepdaughter and I get along well with the kids. She's closer to her mother, but still occasionally does girls days with me. It's more like friends, though. My stepson is incredibly close to me. He calls me his other mom and always asks me to be present for important events. We bonded when his childhood dog passed away as my cat died about the same time Bella and I were best friends. I know people have complicated relationships with their partners'exes, but we always show respect to each other. I never tried to take her place. She and Aaron shared something special. Long before I was in the picture. That's their history. And I am a stepmom, not a mom. Her place in the kids lives.

Kyle came by anyway, said he left his charger. I let him in, still doing my broken English act while I pretended to watch a Portuguese soccer game. He took pictures of our mail, our investment statements, even opened my desk drawer when he thought I wasn't looking. The next week, I accidentally left fake bank statements showing a negative balance and massive debt on the kitchen counter just to see what would happen. Three days later, Kyle told Emma he needed space face and wasn't sure about their relationship, said he wanted to find himself before getting serious with anyone. Emma was heartbroken but suspicious. She asked if my test had shown anything. I told her everything I'd heard. We waited to see if Kyle would come back once the fake bank statements disappeared. Sure enough, two weeks later, he texted her saying he'd work through his issues and wanted to try again. Emma invited him over for dinner. He brought the usual flowers, called me sir again. I served his favorite meal, the one he'd called disgusting behind my back. Halfway through dinner, Emma started speaking to me in perfect English. I responded the same way. Kyle froze with his fork halfway to his mouth. You, you speak English, he stammered, looking at me. I've spoken English for 35 years, I said. Almost as long as I've been able to spot guys who date my daughter for her money. The color drained from his Face. Emma placed her phone on the table, playing a recording of him from last week. Once I'm in with her family, her dad can hook me up with one of his doctor friends. Then I'm set for life. He tried denying everything, said I misunderstood, that my English must not be good enough to understand context. Emma held up his phone. He'd left it unlocked when he went to the bathroom. And these texts to your friends about my rich family you plan to use. Am I misunderstanding those two? He grabbed his phone and stormed out, called Emma crazy, called me a sneaky old man. Emma cried that night but told me the next morning she was grateful. Six months of hurt is better than years of lies. Dad Kyle's now dating the daughter of a car dealership owner. Emma's with a guy she met at nursing school. He brings homemade cookies instead of store bought flowers and talks to me the same way whether Emma's in the room or not.

Creative student. The arms race escalated. figured out the password was always posted in the teacher's bathroom. Thinking students wouldn't see it there, he used a drone with a camera during lunch when the bathroom was empty. The footage was shaky but readable. Ryan, you flew a drone into school property? Into the courtyard. Sir, the bathroom window was open. I was investigating ventilation efficiency for my environmental science project. Mr Morrison put curtains on the bathroom windows. But the masterpiece came from Quiet Emily. She noticed the school's old Wi-Fi routers were still broadcasting, just hidden from the network list. They'd forgotten to change those passwords. She connected to school Wi-Fi 2,015 with the password admin 1, 2, 3 and had faster internet than the teachers. Emily, that network was supposed to be decommissioned. Supposed to be isn't the same as was. Sir, how did you even find it? I didn't. My phone did. I have very aggressive auto connect setting. The breaking point came during standardized testing week. The online test required internet, so they had To give all students the password. Within minutes, someone had shared it on a paper airplane that flew across the gym. Then another student wrote it in chalk on the track. A third person trained the morning announcements kid to say it phonetically while reading the lunch menu. Chicken Tenders, W1 f 1 p at s, s mashed Potatoes, w zero r, d beans, 2 dash 0 dash 2 dash 4, chocolate milk, exclamation point, hashtag dollar sign. Mr Morrison called an emergency assembly. Fine, you win. We're going back to open Wi-Fi with content filter. The auditorium erupted. Then Marcus raised his hand. Mr Morrison, about those content filters, don't just don't already found 17 ways around them. Of course you have. The next day, the Wi-Fi password was, please just you sought responsibly 2,024. Someone changed it to we promise, wink, 2,024. Within an hour, Miss Mr Morrison pretended not to notice. He was tired. The students had won and honestly, their grades had improved from all the technical research they've been doing. Sometimes the best victory is knowing when you've been outsmarted by 2,000 teenagers who turned your security system into their favorite class.

I was on a packed flight to Seattle, squeezed against the window. Just as the doors were closing, a woman rushed on board with a bull boy about 5 years old. They stopped at my row and I immediately felt a sense of dread. The boy pointed at my seat and screamed, I want the window, I want the window. His voice echoed through the cabin. The mother didn't shush him. Instead, she leaned toward me with an entitled smile. Would you mind switching? He'll scream the whole flight if he doesn't get the window. She said it like she was offering me a choice. But her tone made it clear she expected me to move. I'm sorry. I specifically booked the see, I replied. The boy unleashed a scream that made my eardrums vibrate. The mother just shrugged as if to say, see, told you, and took the aisle seat without attempting to calm him. A flight attendant appeared. Is everything okay here? This person won't give my son the window seat and now he's upset, the mother said, making it sound like I was bullying a child. The boy started kicking the seat in front of him where an elderly man sat. The man turned around, clearly in pain. I noticed a cane leaning against his seat. The mother patted her son's leg but didn't stop him. He'll calm down once we're in the air. We took off with The soundtrack of the boy's sobs. Then I felt something wet hit my arm. The boy was deliberately squeezing his juice box, so drops landed on me. She glanced up from her phone. Ethan, don't waste your juice, she said, but made no move to take it away. No apology to me, nothing. Twenty minutes into the flight, the boy unbuckled his seatbelt and stood on his seat. Mother was watching a movie with headphones in. The boy grabbed my book and threw it to the floor. Hey, I said. The mother removed one earbud. What's the problem now? Your son threw my book on the floor, she sighed. Ethan, that's not nice. Say sorry. No, I want the window. She just shrugged and returned to her movie. The elderly man turned around. Would you like to switch seats with me? Before I could answer, the mother jumped in. That would be wonderful. Ethan. This nice man is giving you a window seat, actually.

They didn't realize they just declared war on 2,000 bored teenagers with nothing but time and spite. It's started when Principal Morrison announced a new policy. Students caught sharing the school Wi-Fi password will face immediate suspension. The password was 47 characters long, randomly generated every week and only given to teachers. My friend Marcus was the first to strike back. He brought a 30 foot Ethernet cable to school and plugged directly into the computer lab wall. When Mr Morrison walked by, Marcus was sitting in the hallway, laptop connected, cable snaking under the door. Marcus, what are you doing using wired internet? Sir? The policy only mentions Wi-Fi. That cable is a tripping hazard. I put up caution sign. Marcus had indeed placed tiny yellow wet floor signs every three feet along the cable. Mr Morrison updated the policy. No Ethernet cables over six feet. So Marcus brought six separate six foot cables and five friends. They formed a human chain, each person holding a laptop connected to each other, passing internet from the lab to the cafeteria like a digital bucket brigade. This is ridiculous, Mr Morrison said. This is compliance. Marcus replied, each cable is exactly six feet. New rule, no daisy chaining connection. That's when Jennifer got involved. She noticed the smart TV in the library was connected to Wi-Fi. She screen mirrored her phone to the TV. use The TV's browser to create a hotspot that broadcast to her laptop. Jennifer, you're using the school Wi-Fi? No, sir, I'm using the TV's connection. The TV isn't a student. The TV doesn't need suspension threats, she added sweetly. Mr Morrison banned using school devices as intermediaries. Alex took a different approach. He stood outside the teacher's lounge with a clipboard claiming he was conducting a password security audit for his computer science project. He'd ask teachers to write their password down to test memory pattern. 3 teachers actually did it before word spread. Alex, this is deception. This is social engineering research, sir. Very educational. Did you get the password? That would be unethical to reveal. Meanwhile, Sarah had noticed something beautiful. The attendant system auto connected to Wi-Fi when teachers logged in. She volunteered as an office aide and memorized the password as it briefly.

I used it thinking it was mine. But she trailed off looking mortified. But what? I asked innocently, it made me really sick, like really, really sick. I've been in the bathroom for three straight days. Mark had to take time off work because I couldn't stop. Well, you know, we had to call four different plumbers because I thought I broke our toilet. I nodded sympathetically. Oh, wow, that sounds awful. You know, now that you mention it, I did order some special soap recently. It was this medical grade stuff for my digestive issues. Super strong laxative soap that My doctor recommended the package said to only use tiny amounts and never use it if you don't actually need it for medical reasons. The color drained from her face completely. Medical, medical soap? Yeah. It's prescription strength. Cost me like 200 bucks. I was so bummed when it got stolen off my porch. Had to reorder it and everything. I paused for effect. Wait, you said you used soap that wasn't yours? She started backing away toward her house. I, I thought it looked like regular fancy soap. Oh, Katie, I said, shaking my head sadly. That explains why you've been having such a rough time. That soap is basically medical grade liquid dynamite for your intestines. You probably used way too much of it thinking it was regular soap. She was practically running back to her house at this point, but I called after her. Hey, maybe next time just knock on my door if you think something got delivered to you by mistake. Would save us both a lot of trouble. She never stole another package again.

But here's the thing, I specifically searched for the most brutal laxative soap I could find. This stuff was made for people with serious constipation issues. And the reviews were wild. People talking about how just one use had them glued to the toilet for hours. I made sure to be home when the package arrived and left it sitting on my porch for exactly 15 minutes before going to check on it. Gone just like clockwork. I waited. Three days passed and nothing happened. I was Starting to think maybe she didn't use it yet or figured out it wasn't regular soap. But then on Thursday morning, I heard this commotion next door. Katie's husband, Mark, was outside yelling something about the bathroom being complete, completely destroyed and how they needed to call a plumber immediately. I peeked out my window and saw Katie walking really weird, like she was afraid to move too fast. She kept looking around nervously and rushing back inside every few minutes. By lunchtime, I saw three different plumber trucks parked outside their house. But it got better.

I took a drink and laughed at something on TV, giving no indication I understood. The bartender responded in Greek, you sure? He seems like a regular guy, Dimitri. Sure. That's enough for me.

Don't react to what they're saying about you. I looked up for my beer to see him wiping down the bar, his eyes flicking towards the corner booth where three men sat drinking whiskey. One had a scar running from his eyebrow to his jawline. The other two looked like they lifted cars for fun. I picked up the napkin and read what he scribbled in Greek. They think you're FBI planning something bad. Play stupid, forest. My blood went cold. I was FBI, but nobody in this dive bar in Queens was supposed to know that I've been working undercover for six months trying to infiltrate a Greek organized crime family. My cover was supposed to be solid, just another third generation Greek American who'd lost touch with his heritage, didn't speak the language. The bartender moved away and I forced myself to take another sip of beer like nothing had changed. In Greek, the man with the scar said to his friends, we need to handle this tonight. Can't have fed sniffing around, the warehouse boss said, to make it look like a robbery gone wrong. My hand tightened on the beer bottle, but I kept my expression blank. The second man, built like a refrigerator, responded in Greek, how do we know for sure he's FBI? Scarface laughed without humor. Dimitri is never wrong. The guy's been asking too many questions at The gym about shipping schedules, plus his background check came back too clean. They were talking about me. I've been going to Olympus Fitness for three months, carefully building relationships. The third man said in Greek, so what's the plan? We grab him when he leaves. Too many witnesses, Scarface replied. We follow him home. Do it there, clean, quiet. I pulled out my phone and typed cover blown. Three hostiles planning to follow me home. Need extraction. I hit send and took another casual sip, laughing at something on the TV. My phone buzzed, draft team, 20 minutes out. Keep playing dumb. Exit through kitchen if you can. The bartender came back in English with a thick accent. He said, you need something else? I shook my head. Actually, can I use your bathroom? He pointed toward the back through the kitchen, past the storage room. His eyes met mine for just a second. He was giving me an out. I stood up slowly, left cash on the bar and walked toward the back. Behind me, I heard Scarface say in Greek, he's moving. Petros, go check that he's actually going to the bathroom and not trying to run. I pushed through the kitchen door. The bathroom door was to the left, but straight ahead was a back exit with an alarm bar. If I ran for it, Petros would know. I headed for the bathroom, single stall, cramped. I counted to 30 listening to Petros heavy breathing outside. I flushed, washed my hands and opened the door. Petros was blocking the path back. He smiled, all teeth and no warmth. In English, he said.

Nicole tried backtracking. I just meant it looked too good to be true for someone who, for someone who what I interrupted. For a construction project manager, for someone who doesn't feel the need to flash wealth. Her father spoke up. Nicole, apologize. Now. I was trying to protect Mia from, from a man who saved for 8 months to buy her the ring she deserves. I said I work 60 hour weeks, Nicole. I live in a small apartment and drive an old car because I'm saving for our future, not performing wealth for people like you. Mia was crying now happy tears. You never told me you spent this much. Because it's not about the money. It's about you knowing I'm serious about forever. Nicole fled inside. Several guests followed to comfort her, but most stayed on the deck, suddenly very interested in their drinks. Mia's father shook my hand. I misjudged you, son. The rest of the party was awkward. Nicole stayed inside. When she finally emerged an hour later, eyes red from crying, she walked straight to me. I'm sorry. I was completely out of line. You humiliated your best friend at her own birthday party because you assumed I was cheap. I know there's no excuse. Mia stood beside me. Nicole, I love you, but you've questioned Marcus from day one, the car, the apartment, his job. You've never once asked about who he actually is. I Was looking out for you? No. You were judging him and you were wrong. Nicole left early. Several of her friends left with her. The next morning, Nicole posted a long apology on Instagram about judging people and learning lessons about character versus cash. Got 200 likes. Her comments were full of people sharing similar stories. Mia showed me the post. She's trying. Good for her. Are you still mad? I'm not mad. I'm just done caring what she thinks. We got married last month, small ceremony, close friends, only Nicole wasn't a bridesmaid, but she was there sitting quietly in the back. And I still drive that Subaru because the people who matter don't care. And the people who care don't matter.

Dad actually stood up and said, and we can't forget our baby boy. Hopefully one day he'll find someone special too when he's ready. No rush, Tiger. That's when Vanessa's new husband Nate cleared his throat and approached our table. He looked directly at me, his eyes serious and grateful. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I couldn't let tonight pass without saying something. The reception quieted as he can continued his voice carrying across the room. I need to thank you properly in front of everyone. My mom laughed nervously patting my head. Oh, that's sweet Nate. But what could our little you saved my father's life, Nate said firmly, his voice cracking slightly. Two months ago when every other surgeon said the tumor was inoperable, the silence was deafening. My dad's champagne glass stopped midway to his lips. There must be some confusion, Aunt Linda interjected from the next table. You can't mean. Nate pulled out his phone showing a photo of him and his father at the hospital. Doctor Jane here performed a 16 hour surgery that three other neurosurgeons wouldn't even attempt. The nursing staff called him a miracle worker. My mother's hand which I've been stroking my hair froze completely. He's, he's a doctor. Nate nodded, head of neurosurgery at Presbyterian, youngest department head in the hospital's history. You didn't know. The kid's table suddenly felt like it was under a spotlight. My seven year old cousin looked up from her coloring book. Wait, you're a brain doctor, but my mom said you still lived in your parents basement playing video games. The crowd started murmuring, phones coming out, probably googling my name. My brother Todd's face had gone pale. But, but I gave him Pokemon cards for Christmas last year. I tried to tell you, I said quietly, standing up from the kids table and straightening my tie multiple times. But every time I mentioned the hospital, you assumed I meant volunteering at the gift shop. I paused, looked around to make sure everyone was listening and told them once and for all, I haven't lived at home in 10 years. I have a penthouse apartment and a vacation home in Aspen. That night, I received 17 apology texts, 12 LinkedIn requests from relatives and three offers to catch up over coffee.

I'm 28, but my mom still checks if I brushed my teeth before bed. Three days ago at my sister Vanessa's wedding rehearsal dinner, she literally walked up to me in front of everyone, licked her thumb and tried to wipe something off my face. Mom, what the shush, baby, you've got sauce on your chin. She interrupted scrubbing at my face while the entire wedding party watched. Being the youngest of three kids with a ten year gap from my siblings meant I was permanently frozen at age 12 in my parents minds. After Mom's stunt, dad pulled me aside and slipped me a 20 dollar Bill into my hands, whispering, don't spend it all on video games, champ. My brother Todd, who's 40, ruffled my hair and asked if I needed help cutting my steak. When the hostess asked about drinks, mom quickly interjected, he'll have an orange mix with a little umbrella on the glass. That's his favourite. The bartender looked at me confused, probably wondering why a grown man in a suit was being ordered a children's mocktail. The actual wedding day was exponentially worse. During the ceremony, my parents made me sit between them in the front row and mom tried to hold my hand so I wouldn't fidget. At the reception, while other guests found their elegantly labelled seats, mom guided me by the shoulders to a separate round table in the corner. The Kids table complete with coloring books and a basket of crayons. But the seating chart says, oh, honey, that must be a mistake. She dude already pushing me into a chair next to my 7 year old cousin who immediately asked if I wanted to share her coloring book. My designated meal, chicken tenders with a side of Mac and cheese. While everyone else enjoyed filet Mignon, Uncle Pete walked by and laughed. Still sitting at the kitty table. Huh? Some things never change. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of fun size candy bars, dumping them next to my plate. Save some for after dinner sport. My brother Todd brought his teenage kid. It's over. Pointing at me like I was a zoo exhibit. Remember you guys used to play together when you were little. His 15 year old son looked mortified. Dad, he's literally older than my teacher. But Todd just chuckled. Don't be ridiculous. He's as young as they come when it came to.

When I didn't deny it, she demanded to see the receipt. So I showed her exactly what that fake cost. When I proposed to Mia last month, I kept it simple, quiet. Dinner at the restaurant where we had our first date. Small ring, nothing flashy. Mia loved it. Nicole's reaction when she saw it. Oh, that's cute. Fast forward to Mia's birthday party last weekend. 30 people at Nicole's parents Lake House. I'm grilling burgers when I hear Nicole's voice carrying across the deck. Let me see the ring again, Mia. Mia held out her hand. The diamond caught the sunlight. Nicole grabbed her wrist, examining it closely. I knew it. This is cubic zirconia. The entire deck went silent. Excuse me. Mia pulled her hand back. Sweetie, I worked at a jewelry store in college. I can spot a fake from across the room. Nicole's voice was loud enough for everyone to hear. Marcus got you a fake diamond? All eyes turned to me. I kept flipping burgers. Marcus. Mia looked confused. I shrugged. If Nicole says it's fake, it must be fake. He worked at a jewelry store. Nicole smile was triumphant. See? He's not even denying it. Mia, you deserve better than a man who proposes with costume jewelry. Mia's mother looked mortified. Her father stood up furious. I wanna see the receipt, Nicole announced. Prove me wrong. I Set down the spatula and pulled out my phone. Opened my email and found the receipt. Handed the phone to Nicole. She looked at the screen. Her face went from smug to pale in two seconds. What does it say? Someone asked. Nicole's hand was shaking. There must be a mistake. Read it out loud, I said calmly. She couldn't speak. Mia took the phone from her. Tiffany and Co. 1.5 karat V S1 clarity E color, platinum setting. Mia's voice trailed off. $14,800. Dead silence. That's impossible, Nicole whispered. You drive a Subaru. A paid off Subaru. Because I save my money for things that matter. Mia was staring at the ring with new eyes. Marcus, this is real. Every receipt from Tiffany includes a certification.

Then at Thanksgiving dinner, he found out I had $30 million and had a complete meltdown in front of everyone. My aunt screamed and my dad. Just growing up, Nathan was the golden boy. New car at 16, vacations to Europe, private schools that cost more than a mortgage. Me, I was the boring cousin, the quiet one, the one working after school just to buy a beat up Honda. At family dinners, Nathan bragged while the adults nodded proudly and my aunt clinked her glass like her son and with some kind of prodigy. Meanwhile, when I got a B+ instead of an a, my parents said I wasn't applying myself. That's how it was. Nathan could fail a class and it was just a phase. But while they were laughing at me, I was grinding. I landed an internship at a finance firm, Learned everything, started investing, built a business. By the time I was out of college, I was sitting on something huge. I just didn't tell anyone. Why brag to people who already wrote you off? Fast forward to Thanksgiving this year, Nathan's at the head of the table bragging about some networking trip his parents paid for. Everyone's listening like he's the next Elon Musk. Then my aunt turns to me with her fake sweet voice and goes, Andy, you're still doing paperwork somewhere, right? The whole table chuckles. Nathan smirks something In me snapped. I set my glass down and said, yeah, paper is worth about 30 million. The room went dead silent. My aunt's hand froze halfway to her wine. My dad just stared like he didn't hear me right. Nathan's girlfriend literally pulled her arm off his shoulder. And Nathan, he laughed nervously. Yeah, right. Stop exaggerating. But I wasn't. That's when it flipped. Suddenly, they cared. My aunt leaned in, voice sharp. If that's true, Andy, family helps family. Nathan's been working so hard, you should give him a boost. Nathan perked up immediately. Yeah, bro, you don't even need all that. Help me out. I sat there swirling my drink, realizing they weren't proud of me. They didn't see me as family. They saw me as a bank account. After dinner, my phone blew up, my aunt texting me.

The caption said, the only one who deserves celebrating. I commented, nice cake. My mom replied, at least someone's worth baking for. I smiled, replied, enjoy it while you can. That same night, I made one transfer, sent two emails. 12 days later, my sister screamed when her landlord called and said your rents canceled. I was sitting at my desk eating leftovers when the notification came through a Facebook tag. I opened it expecting maybe a few birthday messages. Instead, 20 photos of an expensive backyard party, white tents, navy linens, catering trays, a neon sign that said Amanda Con 2025. And in the center, a custom cake with gold cursive to our star Amanda. The caption posted by my mom, the only one who deserves celebrating. Every photo showed smiling faces, my parents, Amanda holding champagne, Uncle Rick and Aunt Laura. Not a single mention of my birthday, which was that exact day. I commented, nice cake. My mom replied within two minutes, at least someone's worth baking for. Then I remembered the text from dad two weeks earlier. Hey, we need a little help, something special. Can you send $500? I didn't ask questions, just transferred it. Now I knew where it went. Shrimp platters, monogram napkins, that gold icing, the same Amanda who the night before had been drunk in our family group chat. Imagine being 28. And still figuring life out. At least one of us isn't a total disappointment. Then dropped a gift of someone slow clapping. Nobody said a word that night. After Jess fell asleep, I sat at my laptop, opened the banking app, the joint family account, the one from last year when dad got his hours cut. And mom said it would help us as the team, except the team was just me. Every paycheck I'd throw in a few hundred. They'd contribute maybe $15. Every other month, I transferred everything out clean, not a cent left. Then I sent two emails. First one to Amanda's landlord. I co signed her lease last year. When she couldn't figure out the paperwork. I'm withdrawing.

I say genuinely meaning it. I liked the Hollowgate team. By 10:45. Marcus, our CEO is calling me personally. Randy, there's been a misunderstanding. Can you come in? No misunderstanding. I was terminated yesterday, effective immediately. Look, maybe Jessica was hasty. We can work this out. Sorry, Marcus, but I can't legally represent the company anymore. I'm not an employee. As a consultant, then. Name your rate. I'm not available. Which was true. I had a phone interview with Drift Shade limited at two PM. Hollowgate's biggest competitor. According to Beth's increasingly frantic texts, the hollowgate team gave Jessica exactly 23 minutes to use the technical documentation they'd specifically flown into review. When she couldn't deliver, they politely excuse themselves and said they'd reassess their partnership options at noon. Jessica calls me directly. Voice shaking Randy, you have to help me. This is sabotage. This is consequences, Jeff, I can report you for withholding company information. What information? I took my personal belongings when you terminated me. All official files remain on your servers. Those notebooks contain proprietary data. Those notebooks contain my personal work notes, purchased with my own money. Check my employment contract. She hung up. Two hours later, my wife forwards me a screenshot from LinkedIn. Jessica had posted about exciting restructuring opportunities. Trying To spin the disaster as strategy check planning. The comments were brutal. Three former clients asking where I'd gone, two competitors offering condolences. Even our supplier in Germany asking if we were still operational. By 4 p m, after a promising interview with Drift Shade, I had my answer to Jessica's sabotage accusation. I hadn't sabotaged anything. I'd simply taken my knowledge with me when they showed me the door. Monday morning, I accepted Drift Shades offer. Senior director of Client Relations. 35% salary increase, equity options and a signing bonus. Wednesday, Beth texted me. Hollowgate canceled their contract. They're switching to Drift Shade. Also, Jessica got fired. Marcus discovered she'd been inflating her performance metrics for months. Thursday, my new phone at Drift Shade rang. Randy, this is Tom Chen from hollowgate. We heard you joined the team. When can we schedule that technical review? Sometimes the best revenge is simply stepping out of the way and letting people destroy themselves.

So about six years ago, I went through this messy divorce that basically split our entire friend group down the middle. My ex husband got most of our friends since they were his buddies from college anyway, which sucked, but whatever. I just accepted that I was gonna lose a bunch of people and started over. The worst part was how some of these people acted afterward. Like this one guy, Tyler, who I thought was actually a decent friend. We used to hang out all the time. I'd watch his cats when he went out of town. We did game nights at their place every Friday, and I even helped him move twice. This dude knew me for, like, five years. Right before my divorce was finalized, my ex invited me to this charity gala, the thing he was involved with. He got me a VIP ticket and everything. Probably trying to show off or whatever. I figured, why not? It was for a good cause, and I was trying to be mature about everything. I'm in the V I P. Area getting my little name tag and gift bag when I bump into Tyler. I gave him a friendly wave and said, hey, expecting at least a normal human interaction. This man literally looked me dead in the eye, then looked me up and down like I was some kind of disease and walked around me Without saying a single word, not even a nod. Just straight up pretended I didn't exist. That hit different. Like I expected some awkwardness, but the complete ice cold treatment from someone who used to text me random memes and borrowed my car. Message received loud and clear. Fast forward about four years. I'm remarried now doing really well at my marketing firm. Got promoted to senior director last year. Life's good. Then one random Tuesday morning, I'm drinking my coffee and checking emails when I see this message in my work inbox from guess who? Tyler Fucking Henderson. The subject line was long time no see with one of those cringy smiley face emojis. Email started with hey there, it's been forever since we connected. Hope you and the family are doing amazing. I'm sitting there like did this man forget? He treated me like I had the plague 4 years ago. But it gets better. The next paragraph basically said he'd been job hunting for a while and just applied to our company. Oh, and by the way, he

So our textbook is wrong. The class erupted in whispers. Missus Wilson's voice got tight. The curriculum says. Actually, I interrupted, pulling up the state science standards on my phone, the current curriculum specifically mentions this myth as something to correct. I showed her the screen. That's when she asked me to step into the hallway. The kids watched wide eyed as the door closed behind us. Do you have any idea how hard it is to teach these kids when parents undermine my authority? She hissed. Now they'll question everything I say! I kept my voice calm. Isn't that exactly what we want them to do? Question things and learn critical thinking? I've been teaching for 22 years, she snapped. I'm not changing my whole curriculum because some nurse thinks he knows better than our textbooks. That night, Lily asked me if she was in trouble because Missus Wilson kept giving her mean looks all afternoon. I assured her she wasn't. The next day, Missus Wilson announced a pop quiz with questions like what color is blood inside the body? Lily answered red and got marked wrong. She came home crying with a big red F. I requested a meeting with the principal and brought printouts of medical textbooks, state science standards, and Lily's quiz. Principal Davis listened carefully, then called in Missus Wilson. When confronted with the evidence, Missus Wilson insisted, this is how I've always taught It Principal Davis asked, but is it correct? After a long pause, Missus Wilson said, it's what the children understand better. I lost it. My daughter is crying every morning before school because she's afraid of getting F's for writing down the Truth. Two weeks later, the school replaced their 1998 science books. Missus Wilson was required to attend professional development on current scientific standards. On Lily's next report card, Missus Wilson wrote, excellent critical thinking skills. But at the parent teacher conference, she wouldn't look me in the eye. And when I signed up to help with the science fair, I noticed my name had been crossed off the volunteer list. Lily still checks with me whenever she learns something new at school. Dad, is this actually true, or is it just a Missus Wilson truth?

My daughter's fourth grade teacher told her class that blood is blue inside your body and only turns red when it hits oxygen. Lily came home repeating this fact while showing me her veins. I gently explained, that's actually not true. Blood is always red because of hemoglobin. Just it's darker red in veins. She looked at me confused, but Missus Wilson showed us a whole Powerpoint about it. Dad. She even had diagrams from a science book. Next morning, I packed my work scrubs in my bag. I'm an ER nurse at Mercy General and I was working the 3 p m. Shift. Anyway, I sent Missus Wilson an email asking if I could do a quick 15 minute presentation about blood for Career Day that afternoon. She loved the idea. When I arrived, Missus Wilson introduced me as Lily's dad, who works at the hospital. Twenty eight kids stared up at me from their desks, covered in Lisa Frank folders and Minecraft pencil cases. I heard you guys Learned that blood is blue inside your body, I said. The entire class nodded enthusiastically. Missus Wilson beamed from her desk. I pulled out a vacutainer blood collection tube from my pocket. This is what we use to draw blood at the hospital. Notice something? I held it up. The tube creates a vacuum. No oxygen inside at all. Missus Wilson smile started fading as I explained When we draw blood with these, it never touches oxygen until we pop the cap off. But I showed photos on my phone of sealed blood tubes. See? Still red. The kids were fascinated. I showed them medical textbook pages on my tablet. Missus Wilson kept clearing her throat, her face getting redder than the blood samples on my screen. But our textbook says it's blue. One boy argued, pointing to their science book. I walked over and checked the publication date. 1998. Medicine updates pretty fast, I explained. We used to think lots of things that turned out to be wrong. Missus Wilson suddenly stood up. Well, thank you for that interesting presentation, Mister. Johnson, but we need to move on to math now. I

Now she's back after she kicked her. My ex wife, Sarah and I divorced when our youngest, Mary, was 14. Our two older kids were already in college. So Mary was the only custody battle I pushed for. Shared custody. Sarah wanted everything. Mary stayed with her mom during the week for school. Well, weekends were mine. We had great times together, movies, hiking, just talking. I never bad mouth. Sarah, never made Mary feel caught in the middle. Then came the custody hearing. When Mary stood up to give her statement, she wasn't nervous or reluctant. She was confident, paired, almost rehearsed. My father is unfit to be a parent, she read, her voice sharp and clear. He doesn't care about me. He only wants custody to hurt my mom. He's selfish and doesn't prioritize my needs. Sat there stunned. These weren't just criticisms. They were character assassinations delivered by my own daughter. She said she felt unsafe around me, that my apartment was too small and depressing, that her mother's house was the only place she felt comfortable. She twisted every detail, made our weekend movie night sound like neglect. Sarah sat there with a subtle smile. She didn't need to say anything. Mary was doing all the damage for her. When it ended, I tried to talk to Mary in the hallway. Can we please talk for a minute? She glanced over her shoulder. Without stopping, there's nothing to talk about. From that day forward, Mary cut me off completely. No texts returned, no calls answered. The weekends we used to share just disappeared. I text her, hope you're doing well. Good luck on your test. Get nothing back. For three years, my only connection to Mary was the child support I sent every month and the college fund I kept contributing to. I heard bits and pieces through her older siblings, but Mary never mentioned me, was like I didn't exist. I eventually started dating Lisa, a single mom with three kids. For the first time since the divorce, life felt stable. I had a new family, a fresh start. Then three years after the custody hearing, my phone rang at nine PM Mary's name on the screen, dad. Her voice was shaking, crying.

I can wear whatever I want before our family dinner. I said, absolutely. What she didn't expect was my response when we arrived. Her confidence disappeared when she realized Sienna was that girl. Fashion marketing, always dressed like she was being photographed. When we met, I loved it. She had confidence. But after a while, I realized she didn't just like attention, she needed it. She wore black to weddings, bikini top to a baby shower she once called a funeral aesthetic. Anytime I mentioned it, she'd roll her eyes. You're so controlling. So I stopped saying anything. Then my mom planned this fancy dinner for my sister Bethany, first doctor in the family. Normal restaurant, black tie vibe. I told Sienna, it's a big deal. Dress formal. She didn't even look up from her phone. I know how to dress myself. Sunday night, I'm in a suit. Sienna walks out in a metallic silver mini dress that looked like she was wrapped in tin foil and bad ideas. It barely covered anything. You look memorable, I said. She grinned. Exactly. Your family is going to die when they see me. She wasn't kidding. We walk in, crystal chandeliers, quiet music, people in gowns and tuxes and she looks like she's headed to a nightclub. The entire place went silent. My mom froze mid smile. Bethany just blinked. The waiter came over immediately. Ma'am, I'm sorry, but we have a dress code. Sienna Scoffed. This dress cost three grand. Yes, he said, but it's missing half of itself. The table was dead quiet. I said, they're just doing their job. She spun on me. Are you seriously taking their side? There are no sides. You said you knew how to dress yourself. That's when she lost it. This family is obsessed with appearances. Sorry, I'm not boring like the rest of you, Bethany said quietly. We just wanted to have dinner. Sienna turned on her. Of course you did, Golden Child. You could hear forks hit plates. I stood up. We're leaving, she glared. You can't make me. You're right. I'm going. You can find your own ride. No one said a word. She waited for someone to defend her. No one did. Then she grabbed.

Someone tried to buy $4,000 worth of designer clothes using my card. Shipping address, Jade's apartment. Sienna had saved my card info. I filed a police report and she emailed me at work with an invoice, said I owed her $50,000 for emotional labor. She actually c c'd my boss and my mom. My mom hit reply all thank you for the invoice. Attached is mine, $5,000 therapy after your behavior. $3,000 for the restaurant shawl you refused. $50 teaching my son to recognize red flags. Please pay promptly. But Sienna wasn't done. She showed up at my apartment building knocking on every door, telling people she was my fiance, that I stole her grandmother's ring, that she was pregnant. My 70 year old neighbor called me like, Tommy, there's a shiny woman screaming your name. Police came building banned her. Next morning my car was keyed. Security footage caught her in another metallic outfit. 3 a. M, full glam, scratching my hood. Police added vandalism to the fraud case. Got a restraining order at court. She Showed up in a gold pantsuit, told the judge I was an abuser because I didn't warn her the restaurant had a dress code. The judge blinked. You're saying he abused you by not telling you how to dress? She said, yes. He just sighed. That's not abuse. That's called consequences. Restraining order granted. Then everything collapsed for her at once. Broad charges, job gone, fired after her boss found out she was using company email to threaten me. A mutual friend sent me a screenshot of her latest Instagram post. The universe tests strong women. I'm rising above the hate, manifesting peace and success. Bethany texted me the same day. Mom wants to know if your restraining order includes Thanksgiving. She's ordering extra wine just in case the universe tries to manifest at dinner.

I forwarded it to our legal team with one line. These are my relationships, not his. Three weeks after getting fired, I closed a deal worth $3 million. Vanessa promoted me to vice president. A month later, I got a call from a recruiter. Dryfield was looking for a new VP of Sales. Lawrence had been let go.

Over coffee, she mentioned they needed someone to head their business development to vision, someone like me. I took one Vacation day for an interview. Someone saw me in the Ravyon lobby and told Tyler. Now, Lawrence sat across from me, waiting for me to beg. I understand, I said. His eyebrows twitched. Terminated effective immediately. Clean out your desk. I stood up and extended my hand. He hesitated before taking it. Thank you for the opportunity. The walk back was quiet. Everyone pretending to be busy, stealing glances. I pulled a cardboard box from the supply room, a coffee mug, some pens, a cactus I'd kept alive for three years, four years of my life, smaller than a microwave. April hovered nearby, watching me like I might steal a stapler. I brought in $2 million, they thought.

It's working, Marissa whispered, moving closer. Your friend looks upset. We're just friends. She shouldn't care. Marissa laughed. Friends don't look at friends like that. After two songs, Valerie appeared beside us. Can I talk to you? Her voice was tight and angry. Why? We're just friends who carpooled, I said. Marissa smirked. I'll get us drinks, she said, squeezing my hand. Valerie watched her go. What are you doing with her? Being single like you wanted, I said. Friends, not single. You're with Gary all night. How is that different? We're working on a project at the bar. While he touches you. Tom, their boss, walked up. Great party, Valerie. Where's your boyfriend? Valerie went pale. No boyfriend. I'm focused on work. Tom nodded approvingly. Smart. Relationships kill productivity. That's why you're getting the best projects. He walked away, and Valerie looked at me desperately. See? That's why I needed this. Then go back to Gary, I said. Marissa returned with drinks. Miss me? She asked, linking her arm through mine. Valerie stood there for a moment, then walked back to Gary. But she kept watching us. And an hour later, Marissa was typing her number into my phone when Valerie practically ran over. We need to leave, she said to me. Her voice was panicked. Together? But we're just friends who carpooled, I said. Marissa looked confused. Wait, you two came together as friends? I said. Right, Valerie. She was panicking. And I could see sweat on her forehead. Yes, but we live near each other, and you live near each other. Marissa studied our faces, and I watched her figure it out. Oh, my god, you're together, aren't you? Tom overheard and turned around. Together. Valerie, you just said you were single. Valerie's mouth opened and closed like a fish. Gary appeared, clearly drunk. There you are, babe, he said to Valerie, putting his arm around her. Everyone went silent. Babe, Tom repeated slowly. I thought Jessica from accounting was your girlfriend, Gary. Gary's face went white. Valerie looked at me desperately. James, please, let's just leave. In the parking lot, Valerie grabbed my arm. That wasn't what it looked like with Gary. I pulled away from her. You wanted to be single tonight. You got it. I said. Friends. Friends don't call each other, babe. She started crying, but I didn't care anymore. Can we talk at home? I'm going to Marissa's. What? You just met her, and we're just friends who live near each other, right? I got in the car and drove away.

My girlfriend, Valerie, dropped this bomb on me in the car on the way to her company party. When we get there, we need to act like we're just friends, she said, while checking her makeup in the mirror. I almost missed the turn because I was so shocked. What? I asked? Nobody at work knows we're dating. It's only been six months. I don't want drama at the office. She was putting on lipstick and wouldn't even look at me. So pretend we're not together just for tonight. Act like we're friends. Who carpooled? She kept checking her makeup obsessively. I've been working closely with this guy, Gary on my project. People already gossip about us. If they knew I had a boyfriend, they'd think I was leading him on. She'd mentioned that project a lot lately, always working late on it. So we drive there together but act single. Not single, just friends. There's a difference. She touched my arm. Please, my annual review is next month. I need to seem focused on work, not relationships. I pulled into the parking lot feeling like an idiot. Fine, I said, we're just friends tonight. She smiled and kissed me quickly. Thank you for understanding. Now, remember, we just carpooled because we live near each other. Inside, Valerie was already with Gary by the bar. He was leaning way too close and whispering something that made her laugh. His hand Touched her arm and stayed there. I felt my jaw clench but walked over anyway. Hey, thanks for the ride, I said. Playing along like she wanted. Valerie barely glanced at me. No problem. Then she turned back to Gary like I was nobody. So about that project, Gary said, but he was staring at her lips, not her eyes. I wanted to punch him. Fine. If she wanted to act single, I would, too. I walked over to the food table where a brunette was struggling with a wine bottle. Need help, I asked. She smiled gratefully. Please. I'm Marissa James. I opened it easy. You're Valerie's friend, right? Marissa rolled her eyes. Of course, it's about Valerie. Everyone always notices her. You don't like her. Marissa poured two glasses. She gets all the good projects and all the male attention. She handed me a glass. Especially from taken men. My chest. What do you mean? See Gary over there? He's been dating Jessica from accounting for two years. But look at him with Valerie. I watched Gary whisper in Valerie's ear. She wasn't moving away. I felt sick. Wanna make them jealous, Marissa asked. Suddenly, before I could answer, she took my hand. Come dance. Marissa was a good dancer and made sure we were right where Valerie could see us. Every time I looked over, Valerie was staring.

Sure. I said, you got $32,000 for tuition. I'm building my brand, bro. Then build your way out of my driveway. Saturday morning, Marcus went full influencer meltdown, posted that I was an abusive narcissist, tagged half the family, captioned it, toxic father can't handle the truth. It blew up over 1,000 likes. But the comments, brutal. Bro said he wasn't his real dad and still wanted dad's money. Even my brother texted, want me to comment? I said, nah, let him cook. By Sunday, Marcus was officially expelled from Westfield Academy. He stomped into my room yelling, you ruined my life. Now I have to go to public school. Talk to Dante, I said. Maybe he can get you verified. That night, Veronica tried filing an emergency custody order to force me to keep paying. The judge literally laughed. Private school isn't a necessity, I said. Case dismissed. A few hours later, I found a note under my door. Dad, I messed up. Mom and Dante filled my head with lies. He's broke. She's miserable. I lost the only person who ever cared about me. I'm sorry. Didn't respond. Let him sit with that one. A few days later, he broke down for real. I just wanted to make her proud. She said, you were controlling, that you ruined her life. I laughed. She left because she wanted to sell protein powder on Instagram. That's her dream. Not exactly Nobel Prize material. Then Karma delivered the finale. Dante got arrested selling fake pre workout online. One of his clients ended up in the hospital. Cops found boxes of counterfeit supplements in his trunk. Veronica called me dreaming. This is your fault. If you hadn't been so petty, click blocked. Now Marcus goes to public school, says the kids are more real. Met a girl named Maya who called him entitled on day 1. She's right. I told him keep her. A week later, Veronica showed up again with her sister and Dante's mom begging me to forget. I told them he's learning the difference between love and convenience. That's a lesson worth every penny. Now Dante's in jail, Veronica's back on Tinder. Marcus is working part time, saving up for a used Honda. The car I sold paid off my mortgage. The college funds still sitting untouched. People say I went too far, but I didn't teach him a lesson. Life did. He said I wasn't his real dad. Now he knows what real consequences look like.

Mom's boyfriend is better. I said, okay. Then I stopped the private school payments and sold his car. 72 hours later, his mother was threatening legal action. I raised Marcus alone since he was 8. His mom, Veronica, ditched us for some gym bro named Dante, with a protein shake in one hand and a selfie stick in the other. She didn't want custody. She wanted freedom. So I gave it to her. For nine years, it was just me and Marcus, private school, summer camps, BMW for his 16th, all paid from overtime and sweat. I wasn't rich. I just loved my kid. Then out of nowhere, Veronica pops back in like a bad sequel. She's all designer bags and fake smile. And suddenly Marcus starts spending weekends at her place. Then one Sunday he comes home with Dante's Cologne on his hoodie and a new attitude. He looks me dead in the eye and says, you're not my real dad. Dante gets me better. He actually supports my dreams. Just stared at him. Your dreams of what? Being an influencer. Dante says I have natural charisma. I nodded once. Okay. The next morning I called his school, canceled tuition, listed his car online. By lunch, I had $30,000 sitting pretty in my account. By that afternoon, Marcus came running into the house red faced and crying. They said, I can't take my exams if you don't pay. Ask Your real father figure, I said, cracking a beer. The meltdown was instant. Veronica started blowing up my phone, 47 texts in a day. You can't abandon your son like this, Dante's cousin says. This is illegal. I texted back once, asked Dante to cover it. Next day she stormed into my job screaming in front of my boss that I was ruining Marcus's view. Security dragged her out while my boss just nodded and said, stand your ground, man. That night, Marcus tried the sympathy act, cooked dinner, cleaned his room, even apologized. I didn't mean it, dad. I was just mad. You're my real father, right? and this has nothing to do with your car and school disappearing. He froze. That's different. Get out of my face, Marcus. By Friday, the circus rolled up. Veronica, her sister and Dante's mom, Rosa, 65, dressed like she owned the Vatican start. It's preaching about family values in our family, she says. We don't abandon children. Then pay for his school. I said. Dante strolls in wearing a tank top in December and go.

Then you won't mind explaining why you downloaded his Henderson campaign at 2:00am and presented it word for word as your original work. Derek started stuttering. Michael never said it was his. He shared it openly. Janet interrupted. Actually, Michael emails me his work directly for approval. Your name has never been on any of these projects until you stole them. This is a misunderstanding. Michael and I work together closely. Thomas looked up from his notes. Mister Chen, would you like to respond to that? I've been sitting quietly in the corner letting them present the evidence. Actually, Derek, we've never collaborated on a single project. You taking my work, claimed credit and now tried to get me fired to cover your tracks. Derek turned desperate. This is insane. Michael's just upset that I'm more successful. Ask anyone on the team who the real contributor is. That's when Thomas said something that made Derek's world collapse. Actually, we did ask someone. We asked Michael's brother. His brother. You know him as the company president, Robert Chen. Derek's mouth fell open. Expensive suit. Guy was my brother, Robert, who'd been taking notes on Derek's corporate theft case. You mean the Michael Chen I've been hearing about in family dinners for the past six months? Is the same Michael Chen whose work you've been stealing? Derek looked between us, finally seeing the family resemblance he'd missed when Michael mentioned his coworker was taking credit for his ideas. I suggested he document everything and let it play out. I wanted to see how far someone would go. Robert closed his notebook. Derek, you're terminated effective immediately. Security will escort you out. Wait, this isn't fair. I didn't know he was your brother. That's exactly the point. You thought you could steal from someone who couldn't fight back. After Derek was walked out, Robert turned to me. Why didn't you just tell me who was stealing your work? I wanted to handle it professionally, not through family connections. Well, you handled it perfectly. The documentation you provided will help us prevent this from happening to other employees. Janet smiled. Derek spent months trying to get rid of the wrong person. Turns out he was trying to eliminate his boss's brother while stealing from the company president's family.

What he didn't know was that our boss was my older brother. Started small, then escalated to claiming my entire project proposals as his original ideas. I documented everything instead of confronting him. Screenshots, time stamps, recorded sessions. I figured the truth would come out naturally. The breaking point came during our quarterly review meeting. Derek stood up with my entire marketing campaign, the one I'd spent three weeks developing for the Henderson account, and presented it as his breakthrough concept. I've been working nights and weekends on this, he told the room, really pushing myself to think outside the box for our biggest client. I sat there watching him describe my color schemes, my taglines, even my budget projections, word for word from the presentation I shared with him the week before, asking for feedback as a colleague. After the meeting, Derek cornered me in the break room. You seemed quiet in there, Michael. Everything okay? Just listening. I said, good, because honestly, I've been meaning to talk to you about stepping up your game. The team needs people who contribute original thinking, not just clock watchers. That's stung. Derek looked me up and down dismissively. Maybe consider whether this role is right for your skill set. The next day, Derek scheduled a meeting with our boss, requesting my transfer to a different department. He told Janet that I was holding Back team productivity. Janet listened to his concerns, then asked to speak with me privately. Michael, Derek says you're not contributing ideas and the team's frustrated with your participation. I nodded. What do you think? Janet smiled. I think Derek doesn't know who he's talking about. I've been watching this for months. Derek's been presenting your work as his own. You knew? I know because you emailed me your drafts before every project. I've seen your original files with time stamps. Derek's been accessing shared folders and copying your work. Why didn't you say anything? I wanted to see how far he'd take it. Janet opened her laptop. All file access is logged. Here's Derek downloading your Henderson campaign at 2:00am last Tuesday. He's accessed your files 43 times in two months. So what happens now? Now Derek gets to explain to HR why he's been committing intellectual property theft while trying to frame his victim for poor performance. The HR meeting was scheduled for Friday afternoon. Derek walked in confident, expecting to discuss my transfer to the filing department. Instead, he found Janet, the HR director, and someone he didn't recognize.

I wanna have fun before settling with someone safe like you. So I gave her all the freedom she wanted and lived my life without her. Months later, she, Tiffany and I had spent four solid years building what I thought was something real. We were that couple everyone wanted to be. Weekend trips, actual conversations, genuine partnership. I've been planning to propose within months. Then around year 3, things shifted. She started showing me Instagram posts from her single friends, hitting clubs with this wistful tone. Her sister Ruth and her 23 year old coworker Brianna started filling her head with stories about experiencing everything before settling down. The breaking point came on a Tuesday night in March. She sat me down with that rehearsed speech about never really living and needing to experience, being young and free before settling with someone safe like me. I think we should take a break, she said. Not forever, just until I figure this out. I need to know what else is out there so I can come back to you with no regrets. She wanted six months, maybe a year to test drive other men while I waited around to see if I made the cut. So it's a breakup with the option to come back if your better plans don't work out. I said if you really loved me, you'd want me to be Sure about us. I looked at this woman I've been planning to propose to in three weeks. The ring was literally 20 feet away in my sock drawer. Okay, I said you want space, you got it. Take all the time you need. She left that night. The next day I returned that 8,000 dollar engagement ring and use the money to build the ultimate gaming setup. I got a German Shepherd mix I named Ziggy. Always wanted a dog but Tiffany claimed she was allergic. She wasn't. She just didn't want the responsibility. For the first time in months, I felt relief. No more walking on eggshells. I joined a boxing gym where I met Tommy the firefighter, Marcus the software engineer and Big Jim, the construction foreman. Started lifting seriously, eating right. The transformation was obvious within months. Meanwhile, Tiffany documented her self discovery on Instagram from clubs with Brianna and Derek, from her office. According to Ruth who started calling to fish for information. Tiffany was confused about why I seemed so happy without her. Derek lasted three weeks before ghosting her, then showed up at a company happy hour making out with a 22 year old intern. After Derek came Brad the personal.

Dad was calling relatives telling stories about how I'm unstable. She paused, I've been thinking how many times you covered for them, how much you've given. She teared up. I want out. I don't want to become them. She had a friend in Colorado but no money to get there. I wrote a check for $7,000, slid it across, no strings. Just go. Why are you helping me?

Mom, Dad, Cody, Aunt Jean. You went to the police. We were under stress. We thought you'd understand. You thought I'd stay. Quiet again. Dad moved toward me. Step back or I'm adding harassment charges. A car pulled into my driveway. Grandpa, he stood beside me. I told you to leave her alone, dad tried arguing about family. You've manipulated her for years. She's not your safety net. She's not your bank. And if you committed a crime using her identity, you're lucky she only filed a report. Silence. You don't fight this alone, he told me. Then to them, you're about to learn what happens when you hurt the only person in this family who's ever done right by anyone. They left without a word. They stopped calling. Security footage showed mom signing my name, wearing the necklace she posted on Facebook. The next day, I dropped the charges. The point was boundaries. They got the message. Lana moved to Denver the following week, sent me a photo and a thank you note. Grandpa calls every few weeks, asks about work, tells me he's proud. For the first time in years, I finally feel at peace knowing I did the right thing.

I smiled too. Not because it was funny, but because I finally understood who they were. I stood up, folded my napkin and walked out. Four days later, dad tried pulling $2,400.

They used it for car repairs, Lana's textbooks, Cody's rent. Never said thank you. Two days later, heavy pounding on my door at 8:00am through the people, dad, mom and Cody. I opened the door just wide enough. What? What's this about freezing the account? I kept My voice calm. The accounts in my name. I put the money in. You weren't entitled to it. It's family money. That's not what I heard at dinner. You actually took that seriously. It was a joke. Nobody corrected you. You all laughed and stayed silent. When I left, get over yourself. You can get over the cancelled vacation. Mom's face paled. Cancelled. Charged back the deposit. I booked it. I paid for it. It's gone. Dad exploded. I made every call, paid the down payment, did all the work while you plan to cut me out. I turned to mom. Remember your emergency dental work last year? I covered that. Quietly, she nodded slowly. The hospital co pays the car insurance, your medications, all me. Dad, panic flashed across his face. Mom, the credit card you opened in my name three years ago, I paid it off. But not this.

My boss Joseph wasn't bluffing about the no workplace dating policy. Anyone caught dating got fired immediately. That couple from the business department fired. Mr. And Mrs. Wolowitz divorced. Even my friend Sasha got transferred to another branch for carpooling with another guy to work. If anyone was caught, even just talking for more than five minutes, they'd get called to his office to get lectured. So things were pretty rough in the office. Few people did try to reason with him, but he refused to budge. Workplace romances hurt productivity, he'd say. But everyone knew he was just bitter about the messy divorce with his secretary wife. So now we were all suffering. I'd always been careful about that rule until I met Lance from I T. That day, I was completely panicking. I'd worked all night for an important project, only for my laptop to freeze. One hour before the meeting, Lance came over from the fourth floor and helped me recover my files while making terrible puns to calm me down. Hey, why was the computer cold? It left its windows open. God, it was bad. But I laughed anyway. When he finally saved everything, I almost hugged him. Then we both froze. Right. The rule. Before I left for the meeting, he wrote his number on a sticky note and handed it to me shyly. Here, in case you run into more computer problems. I felt my cheeks flush. I Stared at that sticky note for three days before texting him. We met up at a tiny coffee shop two blocks from the office. During lunchtime, we sat in the back corner, covering ourselves like criminals. Every time the door opened, we both look up, panicked. I watched him duck into the table. When someone from his department walked in to pick up coffee, I laughed. Wow. Crazy first date, huh? He grinned back at me from underneath the table. I love crazy. We were still pretty paranoid on the next few dates. But after three months, we started to get comfortable. Maybe a little too comfortable. That's when it happened. A close call. When we were out at an Italian restaurant to celebrate my promotion, Lance suddenly went ghost white. We need to leave now. But it was too late. Our boss, Joseph, entered the restaurant and locked eyes with us. He marched over, practically foaming at the mouth. Mind telling me what's going on, Lance? And waitress from marketing. Lance stood up slowly. Dad, I can explain. Dad. I choked. Joseph glanced at our table full of candles and rose petals. Clearly not for a casual meeting. You're dating my son in my company, breaking my rules. The entire restaurant got quiet, watching months of secret dating all go down the drain. You're fired. You can forget about the Japanese presentation tomorrow. I won't have liars and rule breakers in my company. I got up and managed to Squeeze out a have a good evening before running out. Next morning, I came in early to pack my desk before everyone arrived, but Lance was already there waiting.

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. We'll clean it up. Please don't. But Elena was already rushing over, not to slap Cologne, but instead to kneel beside me. Honey, stop, you'll cut yourself. She gently took my hands, checking for cuts. Are you two okay? Did you step on any glass? Cologne just laughed. I'm fine, mom. Sorry about the juice. She ruffled his hair in response, which shocked me beyond belief. It's just juice, baby. Accidents happen. Let me get the mop. No timer, no rice, no locked doors, just a mop and a new glass of juice later. When I reached for a third lumpia, I froze, waiting for someone to slap my hand away. Elena noticed and pushed the whole plate toward me. Eat, eat. Growing boys need food. When dinner time came and I said I had to leave, she packed me a container of food for later, she said, winking. Cally complained his report card came and he got a C in English. I tensed waiting for the explosion. Elena just sighed and said, we'll get you a tutor. These things happen. It felt so weird watching this, watching how Chloe's mother never got angry at him for doing something wrong. I even started thinking if this is how a normal home looks like. We were washing dishes together after dinner when I accidentally knocked over Elena's favorite mug, the One that said World's Okayest mom that Tolloy had given her. It shattered against their tile floor. I went completely rigid, my whole body preparing for impact. The apology stuck in my throat. I could already feel my knees against rice, already felt the sun on my face. It's okay, Elena said softly, but I was already crying. Not just tears, but uncontrollable sobbing I couldn't control. Elena was sweeping up the pieces, humming, sweetheart, what's wrong, she asked, hailing beside me. It's just a mug. Why are you so scared? Clyde was staring at me like I'd grown another head. What did you think was going to happen? He asked. I tried to hold it in, but couldn't. I told them about how my mom treated me, about how I thought I was going to be punished severely because I'd broken that mug. Elena's face went through expressions I'd never seen on an adult, horror, rage, then something soft and broken. She pulled me into a hug that felt warm. Then she asked, how many times has that happened? Culloy patted my back as I answered, too many to count. When I finished talking, Elena looked at me for a long moment. You're not going home tonight, she said firmly. She picked up her phone, scrolled through her contacts. Culloy squeezed my shoulder as she dialed. Hello. I need to report child abuse.

I forgot to take out the trash before six PM and started crying before my mom even said anything because I knew what was coming. She grabbed my arm, dragged me to the kitchen and poured uncooked rice across the floor. Kneel on it, she said. I dropped to my knees and the rice dug into my skin like tiny needles. She set the microwave timer for 20 minutes. You'll stay there until it beeps. This is how you learn discipline. My knees went numb after five minutes, but if I shifted even slightly, she'd restart the timer. I'm making you perfect. This is what love looks like. That wasn't just normal for us. It was routine. When I got a B instead of an a, she'd make me stand outside in the sun for three hours. No water, doors locked, neighbors walking by pretending not to see. The world is cruel, she'd say when she finally let me back in. I'm preparing you for it. Every punishment makes you stronger. This is how a good mother loves her son. Then a new kid named Cloy transferred into my class and he became my first friend. After I helped him with an assignment, he told me, come to my place after school. My mom makes incredible Filipino food. I almost said no, but I hadn't eaten anything except school lunch in two days. So I said yes, hoping I Could make it back home by 5. Just for an hour, I said, already calculating how fast I need to run home. His house was only six blocks from school, a small two story with a garden full of tomatoes and a doormat that said welcome in three languages. His mom, Elena, opened the door before we could knock. You must be Chloe's friend. Come in. Come in. I made lumpia. She had flower in her hair, but it didn't dampen her bright smile. The house smelled like fried food and something we baking, not like the cigarette smoke and cheap wine that clung to our walls. A few minutes later, as Chloe was carrying two glasses of juice, he tripped over their cat. The glass shattered across the hardwood floor, orange juice spreading everywhere. My brain froze and I acted on instinct. I immediately dropped to my knees.

I watched this woman get pushed back into immediate danger by the person who was supposed to protect her. When I tried to intervene, Reynolds told me to get back in the car and mind my own business. But I couldn't leave Maria there, knowing what might happen. When we drove away, I told Reynolds we needed to follow department policy and either arrest the boyfriend for domestic violence or wait for a supervisor. Reynolds completely lost it. He started screaming at me in front of both victims, calling me a rookie who didn't understand how the real world worked. He said college kids like me were ruining law enforcement with all our book learning and political correctness. Then he made a critical error. He grabbed Maria again, rougher this time. And when she tried to pull away, he shoved her so hard, she hit the wall. That's when I realized I wasn't just watching corruption anymore. I was witnessing assault and battery by a police officer against a domestic violence victim. Reynolds had crossed the line from bent cop to criminal. I had a duty to act. I stepped between them and told Reynolds he was under arrest for assault. He laughed and said I was crazy, that no one would believe me over a decorated detective. But our body cameras had recorded everything. Reynolds tried to grab my Weapon. While I was reading him his rights, which added resisting arrest and assault on a police officer to his charges, I had to physically restrain a fellow officer who was actively committing crimes against the people we were supposed to protect. The ride back to the station was the longest of my career. Reynolds kept threatening my family, my career, promising that I'd never work in law enforcement again. When we arrived, the entire precinct went silent as I walked their golden boy into the booking area in handcuffs. Some officers looked disgusted. Others looked terrified that their own misconduct might be exposed next. The investigation revealed that Reynolds had been running Protection rackets, failing evidence, and covering up serious crimes for years. Dozens of cases had to be reopened, and several other officers lost their badges for enabling his behavior. Maria testified at his trial and thanked me for not abandoning her when she needed help most. Reynolds got eight years for corruption, assault, and violating civil rights under color of law. The department implemented new oversight procedures and mandatory body camera policies. Some officers resented me for ending the culture of looking the other way, but most admitted the precinct was better without Reynolds terrorizing everyone who couldn't fight back.

What happened? My third month on the force, I Learned that Detective Reynolds ran this precinct like his personal kingdom. Everyone walked on eggshells around him because he had connections all the way up to the commissioner's office. As the new guy, I tried to stay invisible. But Reynolds had other plans. He cornered me in the locker room one morning and said, college boy, huh? Let me teach you how real police work gets done. Reynolds was a 15 year veteran who never faced consequences for anything. He had this way of bending rules just enough to stay under the radar while making life miserable for anyone who crossed him. Other officers would warn me quietly that questioning Reynolds was career suicide. So I kept my mouth shut and tried to learn the job properly. riding with Reynolds was like watching a master class in corruption. He pull over expensive cars in affluent neighborhoods always walk away with cash donations to the Police Benevolent Fund. He confiscated evidence from drug busts that never quite made it to the property room. Most disturbing was how he treated witnesses and suspects using intimidation tactics that bordered on torture. The breaking point came during a domestic violence call at a run down apartment complex. A woman named Maria had called 9 1 1 saying her boyfriend was threatening her with a baseball bat. When we arrived, Reynolds immediately dismissed her concerns. And started flirting with her while she was still shaking with fear. He told her boyfriend, who was clearly intoxicated and aggressive, that these things happen in relationships and maybe they should work it out like adults. Maria begged us not to leave, showing us bruises on her arms from previous incidents. Reynolds laughed and said domestic calls were just drama Queens looking for attention. He started walking back to our patrol car while the boyfriend got more agitated at Maria for calling the police. I could see the terror in her eyes as she realized we were abandoning her with someone who'd been threatening her life. That's when Reynolds made his fatal mistake. Instead of following protocol and either arresting the boyfriend or staying until the situation was resolved, he decided to teach everyone a lesson about wasting police time. He walked back to the apartment, grabbed Maria by the arm and shoved her toward her boyfriend.

My roommate said the girl was literally acting it out at the water fountain, pretending to be me, pushing her chest out and everything. Her friends were all laughing. I was so annoyed. Like, I was out there for two minutes filling up a water bottle. I wasn't doing anything. But apparently this girl had turned it into some whole dramatic story where I was trying to seduce her boyfriend. That night, I had to go brush my teeth before bed. I was already in my pajamas, which was just a T-shirt and shorts, and obviously I wasn't wearing a bra because I was getting ready for bed. I passed the girl and a few of her friends in the hallway on my way to the bathroom. The girl looked directly at my chest, then looked at her friends, and they all started giggling. I just kept walking, but I was pissed. Then yesterday, the entire dorm got an email from our RA. It said she'd received some anonymous complaints about people not dressing appropriately in the hallways and asked everyone to please make sure they're keeping things covered up. I knew exactly who submitted that complaint. This girl had literally gone to the R A. And complained about me not wearing a bra in my own dorm. I was done being nice about it. I remembered from orientation that the girl's boyfriend doesn't actually go to school here. He goes to some other College like an hour away. I also remembered that because of the pandemic, our dorm has a rule that we're not allowed to have non student guests this year. Only students from our school and family members are allowed in the building. And on top of that, everyone has to wear a mask in the hallways. It is a rule that barely anyone follows, but it's still technically a rule. So I went to the same anonymous complaint form that the girl had obviously used, and I submitted a complaint. I'd noticed people bringing their off campus boyfriends into the dorm and that these guests weren't wearing masks in the hallways. I kept it vague, didn't mention any names, just like she did with hers. This morning we all got another email from the RA. It said that due to anonymous complaints, they'd be enforcing the no off campus guests rule from now on. Anyone bringing a guest into the building would have to show their student ID at the front desk to prove they actually go to school here, and masks would be enforced in the hallways. I saw the girl in the hallway later that day and she looked mad. She was on the phone with someone, probably her boyfriend, saying something like, I don't know. They're checking IDS now. You can't come over anymore.

So I got him banned from the building. So I live in a college dorm and our entire floor is all girls. I'm pretty much always wearing a bra if I'm going outside or to class or whatever. But like if I'm just walking 10 feet down the hall to fill up my water bottle or use the bathroom, I'm not putting on a bra. Nobody does that. It's our floor. We all live here. And half the time people are walking around in pajamas or I was going to the shower. Anyway, so a few days ago, I left my room to go to the water fountain. I was wearing a white tank top and no bra. The tank top wasn't see through or anything, but yeah, you could probably see the outline if you were looking. I filled up my water bottle, walked back to my room. The whole thing took maybe 2 minutes. There was a small group of people hanging out in the hallway near some of the other rooms, but I didn't really pay attention to them. It's a dorm. People hang out in the halls all the time. About half an hour later, I hear a knock on my door. I open it and it's one of the girls from that group in the hallway. I recognised her from orientation at The start of the year, we talked a few times back then. She had this kind of awkward smile on her face and was like, hey, so sorry to ask you this. If you go out into the hall again, could you maybe put a bra on? My boyfriend was out there and he was kind of staring. So I'm not a confrontational person at all. Like I hate conflict. So I was just like, oh, yeah, sure, sorry about that. Even though in my head I was thinking, why is that my problem if your boyfriend can't control himself? But whatever. I didn't want to make it into a thing. So for the rest of that night, anytime I left my room, I threw on a bra or a hoodie. I figured that was the end of it. It wasn't. The next day, my roommate came back from the bathroom and told me she'd overheard the girl talking to her friends in there. She said the girl was making the whole thing sound completely different from what actually happened. She was telling them that I'd been basically half naked, taking my sweet time at the water fountain, posing and arching my back to make my chest stick out like I was purposely.

Two days before the wedding, Cassidy called me directly. We need to talk about your equipment, she said. No greeting, no pleasantries. I was editing photos at my desk. What about it? Simone's been looking at your Instagram, and honestly, your camera gear seems kind of basic. Her cousin Jerome has a newer model, and he offered to shoot the wedding for free. I've been shooting with professional equipment worth about $30,000. Jerome, I later discovered, owned a Canon Rebel. He bought it Best Buy three months ago. I have a signed contract. I said carefully. The wedding is in 48 hours. Cassidy's voice turned cold. Yeah, about that. Simone doesn't want to pay your ridiculous fee for amateur work. Consider this your notice. We're going with Jerome. She hung up before I could respond. Twenty minutes later, I got an email from Simone officially terminating our contract, citing creative differences and equipment concerns. The contract was crystal clear. Cancellations within 30 days meant they still owed the full fee. Plus I kept the deposit. But More importantly, there was something Simone and Cassidy had complete they forgotten about. I'd already photographed their wedding. The entire thing. See, three months earlier, Simone insisted on doing a complete wedding rehearsal at the actual venue. Full ceremony, run through reception, timeline, even a mock first dance. She wanted everything perfect, down to the minute. Bring your camera, she said. We need to test all the lighting and angles. I'd spent six hours that day shooting every moment like it was the real wedding. Professional vows, couple portraits, family groupings, reception details, everything. Simone had been wearing her actual wedding dress because she wanted to see how it photographed. Greg wore his tuxedo. The bridal party was in full attire. The images were stunning. Golden hour light, emotional moments, perfect compositions. Some of my best work ever. And according to our contract, any photos taken during pre wedding sessions belong to me. Unless

Then pay for his school. I said. Dante strolls in wearing a tank top in December and goes, bro, let's talk man to man. Sure. I said, you got $32,000 for tuition? I'm building my brand, bro. Then build your way out of my driveway. Saturday morning, Marcus went full influencer meltdown. Posted that I was an abusive narcissist, tagged half the family, captioned it toxic father can't handle the truth. It blew up over 1,000 likes. But the comments. Brutal. Bro said he wasn't his real dad and still wanted dad's money. Even my brother texted, want me to comment? I said, nah, let him cook. By Sunday, Marcus was officially expelled from Westfield Academy. He stomped into my room yelling, you ruined my life, now I have to go to public school. Talk to Dante, I said. Maybe he can get you verified. That night, Veronica tried filing an emergency custody order to me to keep paying. The judge literally laughed. Private school isn't a necessity, he said. Case dismissed. A few hours later, I found a note under my door. Dad, I messed up. Mom and Dante filled my head with lies. He's broke, she's miserable. I lost the only person who ever cared about me. I'm sorry. Didn't respond. Let him sit with that one. A few days later, he broke down for real. Dad, I just wanted to make her proud. She said you were controlling, that you ruined her life. I laughed. She left because she wanted to sell protein powder on Instagram. That's her dream. Not exactly Nobel Prize material. Then Karma delivered. The finale. Dante got arrested selling fake pre workout online. One of his clients ended up in the hospital. Cops found boxes of counterfeit supplements in his trunk. Veronica called me screaming, this is your fault. If you hadn't been so petty. Click blocked. Now. Marcus goes to public school. Says the kids are more real. Met a girl named Maya who called him entitled on day one. She's right. I told him. Keep her. A week later, Veronica showed up again with her sister and Dante's mom, begging me to forgive. I told them he's learning the difference between love and convenience. That's a lesson worth every penny. Now Dante's in jail, Veronica's back on Tinder. Marcus is working part time, saving up for a used Honda. The car I sold paid off my mortgage. The college fund still sitting untouched. People say I went too far, but I didn't teach him a lesson. Life did. He said I wasn't his real dad. Now he knows what real consequences look like.

Mom's boyfriend is better. I said, okay. Then I stopped the private school payments and sold his car. 72 hours later, his mother was threatening legal action. I raised Marcus alone since he was 8. His mom, Veronica, ditched us for some gym bro named Dante, with a protein shake in one hand and a selfie stick in the other. She didn't want custody. She wanted freedom. So I gave it to her. For nine years, it was just me and Marcus, private school, summer camps, BMW for his 16th, all paid from overtime and sweat. I wasn't rich. I just loved my kid. Then out of nowhere, Veronica pops back in like a bad sequel. She's all designer bags and fake smile. And suddenly Marcus starts spending weekends at her place. Then one Sunday he comes home with Dante's Cologne on his hoodie and a new attitude. He looks me dead in the eye and says, you're not my real dad. Dante gets me better. He actually supports my dreams. Just stared at him. Your dreams of what? Being an influencer. Dante says I have natural charisma. I nodded once. Okay. The next morning I called his school, canceled tuition, listed his car online. By lunch, I had $30,000 sitting pretty in my account. By that afternoon, Marcus came running into the house red faced and crying. They said, I can't take my exams if you don't pay. Ask Your real father figure, I said, cracking a beer. The meltdown was instant. Veronica started blowing up my phone, 47 texts in a day. You can't abandon your son like this. Dante's cousin says. This is illegal. I texted back once, asked Dante to cover it. Next day she stormed into my job screaming in front of my boss that I was ruining Marcus's view. Security dragged her out while my boss just nodded and said, stand your ground, man. That night, Marcus tried the sympathy act, cooked dinner, cleaned his room, even apologized. I didn't mean it, dad. I was just mad. You're my real father, right? and this has nothing to do with your car and school disappearing. He froze. That's different. Get out of my face, Marcus. By Friday, the circus rolled up. Veronica, her sister and Dante's mom, Rosa, 65, dressed like she owned the Vatican. Starts preaching about family values in our family, she says.

What happened? My third month on the force, I Learned that Detective Reynolds ran this precinct like his personal kingdom. Everyone walked on eggshells around him because he had connections all the way up to the commissioner's office. As the new guy, I tried to stay invisible. But Reynolds had other plans. He cornered me in the locker room one morning and said, college boy, huh? Let me teach you how real police work gets done. Reynolds was a 15 year veteran who never faced consequences for anything. He had this way of bending rules just enough to stay under the radar while making life miserable for anyone who crossed him. Other officers would warn me quietly that questioning Reynolds was career suicide. So I kept my mouth shut and tried to learn the job properly. riding with Reynolds was like watching a master class in corruption. He pull over expensive cars in affluent neighborhoods always walk away with cash donations to the Police Benevolent Fund. He confiscated evidence from drug busts that never quite made it to the property room. Most disturbing was how he treated witnesses and suspects using intimidation tactics that bordered on torture. The breaking point came during a domestic violence call at a run down apartment complex. A woman named Maria had called 9 1 1 saying her boyfriend was threatening her with a baseball bat. When we arrived, Reynolds immediately dismissed her concerns. And started flirting with her while she was still shaking with fear. He told her boyfriend, who was clearly intoxicated and aggressive, that these things happen in relationships and maybe they should work it out like adults. Maria begged us not to leave, showing us bruises on her arms from previous incidents. Reynolds laughed and said domestic calls were just drama Queens looking for attention. He started walking back to our patrol car while the boyfriend got more agitated at Maria for calling the police. I could see the terror in her eyes as she realized we were abandoning her with someone who'd been threatening her life. That's when Reynolds made his fatal mistake. Instead of following protocol and either arresting the boyfriend or staying until the situation was resolved, he decided to teach everyone a lesson about wasting police time. He walked back to the apartment, grabbed Maria by the arm and shoved her toward her boyfriend.

I care about my teenage boy, but I'd be dishonest if I said I wasn't let down by the kind of person he's becoming. My son began getting into this different look back when he was in middle school. At first he just wore black clothes, but once he got to high school, he's gone way too far with his strange style and I really don't like it. My wife doesn't seem to mind, but she's a pretty passive woman and has never been a very strict parent like me. If I were to describe how my son dresses now, he wears big, baggy black clothing and lots of chains and rings. At one point, he was even dying coloured strips into his hair. I remember being so upset the first day I saw this. It was just so embarrassing to see my child walking around like that. Now, I don't have a problem with gay people or anything like that, but I never really wanted that type of thing to be a part of my own household. I've never confronted my son about his sexuality and I really just don't wanna know if he does happen to be. Our relationship is already sort of strained and I feel like if I found out he wasn't straight, it would make it very hard for me to treat him the same. Like I said, I don't have a problem with gay people. I just don't wanna be shoved in my face on top of everything. Ever since my son entered high school, he's made friends with mostly girls. At first I was glad to see this, and I was happy that my son still might have a chance of growing up into a real man's man. But as time went on, I realized that he wasn't in a relationship with any of these girls dead. They were all just his close friends. He constantly has his friends over the house and is part of a friend group with three other girls. To be fair, these girls have always been nothing but polite to me and my wife and are always respectful of our house. Still, it just rubs me the wrong way that my son doesn't seem to have any close guy friends. And I feel like it's not good for him to grow up that way. I tried my best to be non judgmental towards my son, even though to me he looked like more of a freak of nature. Every day the more he kept leaning into his alternative fashion. I didn't understand it, since all of his friends were normal girls. He was the only weirdo in his friend group who dressed like some 90s mall rat. When I look at him, he honestly reminds me of the kind of kids I would pick on in high school. Anyway, about a Year ago, I ran out of patience with him when he came home one day with his nails painted a shade of bright blue. My son had never done anything like this before, and I couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly disgusted. I. I told him that he had gone too far with his emo bullshit and that I couldn't continue letting him make a fool out of himself like this. I told him that at one point he needed to become a man, and painting his nails made him look like some sort of weak top. My son and I had never really been close. We didn't even speak that often, so he looked very hurt as I was telling him all this. But I couldn't help it. He had needed a reality check for so long and there was no avoiding this conversation. I told my son to go get nail polish remover and remove his nail polish right there in front of me. That's when he started to get angry and said that he didn't have to change himself just to appease my dumb homophobic self. My son has never spoken to either of his parents this way, and I knew that there was no way I was letting him get away with it. I yelled at him for cursing at me like that, and I told him that he would remove his nail polish immediately or there would be serious consequences. He said that there was nothing Worse I could do to him than continue being such a hateful father. And that's when I lost my shot. I told him that I would ground him for the entire year if he didn't remove his nail polish within the next 60 seconds. Looked at me and told me that I could try, but I would never be able to control him and that he hated me. He ran up to his room after this, and I followed through on my threat. I took his phone away and replaced it with a flip phone, and he wasn't allowed to go out or have his friends over anymore. All he did after that for the rest of the year was call his friends in his room and completely ignore me. One night, I overheard him crying to my wife about how much he hated his life since being grounded. But all she said was that I was his father and he needed to respect me. Proud of my wife for sticking up to me behind closed doors. And I still felt like I had made the right decision. I won't lie and say that it hasn't been a difficult year. My son stopped talking to me the day I grounded him, and I honestly do miss him. He graduates next year, and I just hope before then he'll realise that I was only ever trying to do what was best for him.

I need extra hands. Yeah, I don't think so. I wasn't about to climb into a bathroom stall with a freak. No, please. I think I might bleed out. Her voice was shaking. And suddenly this wasn't funny anymore. It was summer from my English class, a pregnant senior who everyone whispered about but nobody really talked to. She was sitting on the toilet, gripping the handicap rail with white knuckles, and her face was covered in sweat. What's wrong? I asked, even though I was starting to guess. Please do something. I'm giving birth. She looked up at me with pure terror in her eyes. My whole body went cold. I was 17 and barely knew how tampons worked, let alone babies. But she was crying and alone, and I couldn't just leave her there. I hopped over the stall divider awkwardly and almost slipped on the wet floor. That's when I saw it. The baby was already crowning. There was blood on the toilet seat and the floor, and summer was making the low groaning sounds that scared me more than anything. This was actually happening in a gross school bathroom with fluorescent lights and graffiti on the walls. I'll be right back. I ran out of the bathroom. Still in shock. I sprinted down the hallway to Missus Bashar's classroom. She was my favourite teacher and The only adult I could think of who wouldn't freak out, I burst through her door, interrupting her lecture on photosynthesis. The whole class stared at me. I need your help urgently, please. I was out of breath and probably looked insane. Missus Bashar took one look at my face and followed me without asking questions. We ran back to the bathroom and I could hear summer sounds getting louder. Other kids were starting to peek out of classrooms wondering what was happening. Missus Bashar pushed open the stall door and immediately went into teacher mode. Okay, honey, I'm here. You're doing great. I'm going to support you while she gets the nurse. I didn't need to be told twice. I ran to the nurse's office faster than I'd ever run in PE. When I burst through the door, Nurse Patty was checking Casey's temperature. Casey, who everyone knew was Summer's boyfriend, the guy who'd been bragging about becoming a dad at prom. Summer's having her baby in the bathroom right now. I basically screamed it. Casey's face went from white to green. He threw up all over the floor before Nurse Patty could grab a trash can. But we didn't have time to deal with that. The three of us ran back to the bathroom with nurse Patty grabbing emergency supplies from her cabinet. By now, half the school had heard something was happening. Kids were crowding outside the bathroom door trying to figure out what all the screaming Was about teachers were trying to move them back to class, but nobody was listening. When we got back to the stall, it was chaos. Missus Bashar was holding Summer's hand while she pushed. The nurse immediately took over, checking how dilated she was and telling summer to breathe. Casey stood frozen in the doorway looking like he might pass out. That's when summer grabbed my hand and pulled me close. You have to get.

Where did you write down how to make Antonio's plate? Carlos is freaking out. I texted back, everything should be in the kitchen somewhere. There's nothing here. Just the regular menu recipes. Of course, there wasn't anything written down. All those special orders lived in my head, like Don Roberto's Saturday special with my secret salsa blend that took me three years to perfect. Or Maria's eggs with that specific combination of peppers she'd been ordering for 15 years. I knew exactly how much of each spice to use, which vendors sold the best chilies and how every regular like their tortillas toasted. At 8:30, Elena called me directly. Miguel, Don Roberto's whole family is here for their monthly gathering, 12 people, and they all want their usual orders. Roberto's asking for you specifically. I wish I could help, I said. And I really meant it because I like Don Roberto and his family. By 9:00am, owner Rosa Herrera called begging me to come back for triple pay. But I told her I'd already started at Lupita's Kitchen down the street. Elena texted that Don Roberto waited exactly 20 minutes before standing up with his entire 12 person family and announcing they were going to find wherever Miguel's cooking now. And within an hour, half the breakfast crowd had followed them to Lupita's. At noon, Carlos called accusing me of sabotage and theft. Those recipes are company property. What? Those were my creations from 12 years. Made with spices I bought myself and notes in my personal notebook. He threatened to sue, but I told him to check with Rosa about what belonged to the company and he hung up. That afternoon, Carlos posted on Facebook about exciting standardized menu improvements, but comments destroyed him, with customers asking where I went and saying they'd never come back. One lady wrote her mother had been coming for 30 years and Saturday was her first walk out. Monday, I was officially at Lupitas with a 45% raise plus a share of breakfast sales. Thursday, Elena texted that Carlos got fired after Rosa discovered he'd been stealing by lying about food costs and the community center switched their catering to Lupitas. Friday morning, Don Roberto sat at his new regular table while I served his Saturday special with extra jalapenos Miguel, he said with a big smile, this tastes just like it should.

Growing up, Haley never missed a chance to remind me I wasn't real family. Every sibling fight ended the same way. At least my parents actually wanted me from the start, instead of getting stuck with leftovers. It stung every single time. Our parents loved me. I knew that. But Haley's words planted seeds of doubt. Was I really chosen, or was I just convenient? When I was 15, something shifted. I overheard mom and dad talking about how they wish they could connect better with different cultures, especially after watching a Korean drama together. Mom sighed and said, I wish I could speak another language. It would open up so many conversations. That's when I got my idea. I started learning Korean in secret. Every night after homework, I'd use language apps with headphones. I found online tutor and told my parents the money was for school projects. I watched K dramas without subtitles, practice pronunciation until my jaw ached. Even started cooking Korean recipes I found online during weekends when everyone was out. Meanwhile, Haley was busy dating Daniel, this guy she met at community college. She'd constantly brag about how cultured and worldly he was because he'd spent a semester in Europe. She'd make snotty comments like, some people are naturally interesting, others are just basic, always looking right at me when she said it. What made it worse was That our parents seemed impressed by Daniel, too. They'd ask him about his travels, his experience, princes treating him like he was this sophisticated addition to our family dinners. Daniel was actually pretty nice to me, but Haley would always cut our conversation short. Don't bore him with your random interests, she say, rolling her eyes. The perfect opportunity came during Haley's graduation party from community college. She'd invited Daniel and insisted he bring his parents, who had immigrated from Korea when he was young. She wanted to show off her international boyfriend's family to all our relatives. But when Daniel's parents arrived, everything went sideways. They spoke very little English, and Daniel was really stressed trying to

Did you tell him about Vegas yet? Lol. I responded, Vegas, tell me more. What she confessed next made me cancel the wedding during her bachelorette party. We've been together 4 years. Engaged one. The venue was locked. Caterer paid, dress fitted. She left Thursday for her bachelorette weekend. She and her bridesmaids. Laughter in the air, champagne flutes ready. Everything seemed perfect until Friday. Did you tell him about Vegas yet? Lol. I stared at my phone. Vegas. She went to Vegas 6 months ago for a work conference. Nothing ever about Vegas yet. But I played along. Vegas, tell me more. Three dots appeared. Stay, disappeared, stayed again. Then my phone rang. It was Jenna, her maid of honor. Her voice high, nervous. Tom, I meant to text Kayla. It's nothing. Just a joke about that conference. I said. We're getting married tomorrow. If there's something I should know about Vegas, now's the time. Silence. Can we meet? I can't do this over text. We met at a coffee shop downtown. Kayla had ducked out of party prep. Jenna sat, shaking face pale, tears in her eyes. The guilt's been eating me, she said. What happened in Vegas? She leaned forward. It wasn't just a conference extend. Kayla met up with her ex, Dimitri. They hooked up. Worse, they got married. My gut dropped. Married as in legal. Jenna showed me a photo. Kayla in a White dress, not a wedding gown. But in a small chapel, standing beside Dimitri, they were married. Legal, Jenna stammered. We were drunk, thought it was a joke, but it was legal. She tried to get it annulled quietly. She said it would be handled before your wedding. So she wanted me to marry a woman who's already married. She told me she would finalize it after your wedding. She wanted you to believe the paperwork was done so no one would know. I barely heard her. My mission was set. I left the coffee shop. I drove to the Ritz where the bachelorette party was going full swing. Laughter, music, champagne. I knocked. Tori, Kayla's sister, answered, glass in hand. Tips. Tom, you can't be here. Boys aren't allowed. I squared my shoulders. We need to talk now. Kayla appeared behind her in a sash and tiara. Her face drained. What are you doing here? I said, Vegas, Dimitri, the chat.

I, twenty seven f, have spent my entire life playing second fiddle to my sister Anna. 30th. She's always been the golden child. Growing up, Anna got princess parties with ponies. I got frozen pizza and a cake from Walmart. She got new toys, I got knock offs with pieces missing. Her college fully funded mine. I had to pay rent to live at home while working a $9 per hour job and studying computer science. Every time I asked why she got help and I didn't. You're independent. You'll figure it out. So I did. I skipped meals, borrowed textbooks, and still graduated with a 3.9 GPA. No Celebration, just another night at home like nothing happened. Meanwhile, Anna graduated with a 3.2 and got a catered party with a DJ and champagne toasts. I stopped sharing my life with them. Especially when I started house hunting. I knew the second they found out, they'd find a way to make it about Anna. And they did. A coworker accidentally let it slip that I was looking. Within days, my mom called all fake cheerful. Kate, we've been looking at houses for you. You'll need at least four bedrooms for the kids when they visit, and maybe a pool. I don't have kids. They meant Anna's kids. Then the link started. Every day. Giant Homes with five bedrooms, yards, extra rooms for Josh's office or space for mom and dad to visit. Anna even sent me one that said this would finally give us room to breathe. Us. I stopped responding, silenced the group chat, finished closing on a house by myself. A quiet two bedroom cottage outside the city. It wasn't big, but it was mine. Kitchen, cozy porch, garden in the back. I didn't tell them a thing. Then came the family dinner. I showed up, sat through fake small talk, knowing something was coming. Sure enough, after the lasagna, mom pulled out her phone like she was announcing a real estate deal. We found the perfect place. Five bedrooms? Yes! Sweet. And it's only a few blocks from Anna's. I set my fork down and said, I already bought a house. Silence. Anna stared at me. Wait, what? A two bedroom? Where are we supposed to stay? You're not. Boom! Mom lost it. How could you make such a huge decision without us? We've been helping you. No, I said you've been house shopping for Anna, not for me.

Then her piggy bank was suddenly empty. I went to grab some quarters from my daughter's piggy bank for parking and found nothing but three pennies rolling around inside. Layla was only seven and had been saving up for months to buy a new bike with all her birthday and tooth fairy money. The piggy bank felt way too light when I picked it up, and those three pennies made this sad little noise when I shook it. When Layla got home from school, I sat her down at the kitchen table with her favourite snack. Sweetie, where did all your piggy bank money go? She kept her eyes on her shoes and mumbled something I couldn't hear. What was that, honey? I asked gently. I gave it all to Aubrey, she finally said louder. She never has lunch money, and yesterday the lunch lady didn't let her eat. My heart swelled with pride, but I was also confused. Why didn't this kid have lunch money? The next morning, I gave Layla five extra dollars. Give this to Aubrey for lunch today, okay? She jumped up and threw her arms around me. Thanks, Mommy. You're the best, she said, before running to catch the bus. I couldn't stop thinking about why some kid didn't have lunch money every single day. Because as even when money was tight, we always figured it out. Around lunchtime, my phone rang. This is Principal Rouse, could you come in for a meeting about Layla? Twenty minutes later, I was sitting in the principal's office. Your daughter has been giving money to another student, which is technically against school policy, but we need to talk about the whole situation here. I braced myself. Aubrey's family has been going through a lot. We can't share all the details, but your daughter has been making sure that child eats lunch every day. She paused and looked at me carefully. The family applied for free lunch, but there's a waiting period and tons of paper.

Last December I was killing time at the mall, waiting for my girlfriend to finish her shift at the jewelry store, when a tiny woman in an elf costume grabbed my arm. Please, please, you have to help me, she whispered, her fake pointed ears drooping. Santa just quit mid shift and there are 40 kids in line. I'm 6 foot 4 with a beard I've been growing since October. She looked at me like I was the answer to her prayers. I don't know anything about being Santa, I protested. She was already dragging me toward the North Pole set up. Can you say ho ho, ho and not swear in front of children? When I nodded, she said, you're hired. Before I could object, she shoved me into a break room where a red suit hung on a chair, still warm from the previous Santa. He left because kid threw up on him, she explained, tossing me the pants. Third time this week. I should have run, but she looked so desperate, and somewhere outside, children were waiting. The suit was too small, the jacket barely closed, the pants ended at my calves, and the beard kept sliding sideways. The elf, who introduced herself as Brenda, looked me over and sighed. It'll have to do. Just remember, every kid gets a candy cane. No promises about specific gifts. Absolutely no holding babies. My First kid was easy, a shy five year old who whispered she wanted a Dinosaur. I deepened my voice, said something about checking my list, and sent her off with a candy cane. I thought I had this figured out. Then came Tyler. Tyler was seven, skeptical, and armed with questions. Why does your beard smell like coffee? He demanded. How do you fit down chimneys if you're so fat? Before I could answer, he pulled my beard down and announced to the entire line, this isn't the real Santa! Panic spread through the crowd. Parents glared, children started crying. Brenda

We can make this unpleasant. Are you threatening me? I asked calmly. Phone recording in plain sight. Give back the ring, give Isabel her furniture half and apologize publicly. No. The ring's in secure storage. She can have furniture if she pays moving costs. And I won't apologize for being dumped by a text. That evening, I drove to storage with a sickening feeling.

The one thing truly irreplaceable to me. I'd mistaken my calm for weakness. Fine. They'd get a war fought.

They arrived as a phalanx. Marcus, Eleanor, Isabel and Julian. I presented simply. Here's the list. Bills, receipts, photo of me wearing my grandfather's watch. And the text that started it all. I read it aloud. I'm not marrying A broke man. Either upgrade or I'm gone. Marcus argued the items were gifts. Text was hyperbole. I was vindictive. The judge looked at Isabel. Did you take the watch from the desk? Her eyes flickered to her mother. It was a gift. Is that true, sir? No, your honor. It was my grandfather's. Priceless to me. She ruled in my favor on all counts. They were ordered to return everything and pay the watches value plus outstanding rent. Julian had to physically restrain Marcus from yelling at the judge. A week later, a courier delivered the camera, laptop, and a check. Oh, note, I sold the ring and used it as down payment on a condo. A real upgrade. Months later, Isabel texted at 2 a m. Heard you bought a condo. Guess my little push worked. You should thank me. I deleted it without replying.

When I was broke in college, my roommate's cousin Kevin offered me what seemed like the easiest job ever. Manage an online clothing store's Instagram. Post pictures, reply to comments, copy paste stuff. 300 bucks a week, cash through Zell every Friday, plus he'd give me a free iPad to use. I didn't even have to leave my dorm room. I said yes in, like, two seconds. The store was called Sunset Styles. Kevin sent me a drop box full of pictures. Crop tops, jeans, sneakers, dresses. All I had to do was post them with captions he wrote, schedule them for certain times, and answer DMs. Simple stuff. The first week, I got paid exactly on time. I remember buying groceries without checking my account first. Felt amazing. Then the messages started coming in. At first, just one or two people asking where their orders were. I'd forward the messages to Kevin like he told me. He'd say he'd handle it. But more kept coming. People were getting mad. One girl said she ordered a hoodie three weeks ago and got nothing. Another said the tracking number didn't work. I started feeling weird about it, but Kevin kept saying the shipping company messed up and he'd fix everything. By week three, my DMs were full of angry people. I'm talking hundreds of messages. People calling me a scammer, saying I stole their money. I tried talking to Kevin, but He just kept saying, forward it all to him and don't worry about it. He even gave me a script to copy paste. So sorry for the delay. Shipping is backed up, but your order is coming soon. I used that message probably 500 times, and this girl named Becca made a TikTok. She ordered a jacket for 60 bucks and never got it. But here's the thing. My face was in the Instagram stories. Kevin had me do a few try on videos to make the page look real. So Becca Screen recorded my videos and put them in her TikTok with text saying, this girl scammed me and won't respond. That video got a million views in two days. Suddenly, my Instagram was flooded. People found my personal account. They found my school. Someone posted a screenshot of me in the campus library with the caption, scammer goes here. My roommate came back one day and asked if I was actually stealing people's money. I tried explaining it wasn't me, but she looked at me like I was lying. I texted Kevin freaking out. I said I wanted to quit. He said I couldn't just quit because people were.

She's literally trying to have a bridal moment at my wedding. Some guests look confused. Others are whispering. But here's what none of them knew. Logan's groomsmen were my cousins. The same cousins who watched me get screwed over my entire childhood. The same ones who knew every single story of Brianna. I getting whatever she wanted while I got nothing. As Brianna reaches the halfway point, still waving and smiling, my cousin Dan and his brother set directly into the aisle in perfect sync. They pick her up horizontally like a surfboard. One guy has her shoulders, one has her legs. Brianna starts screaming, what are you doing? Put me down right now! They don't say a word. They just carry her straight past the shocked guests, out the side door and into the parking lot. Her bouquet falls on the ground. The entire church goes dead silent, and someone in the back starts clapping. Then more people join in. Then everyone's clapping and laughing. My parents jump up to chase after her, but my Aunt Helen physically blocks the exit. She's a big woman, and she plants herself there like a wall. She looks at them and says, sit down. You've ruined enough of her life. You're going to sit here and watch her get married. We finished the ceremony. It was perfect. Beautiful. Everything I wanted. During cocktail hour, I found out Brianna spent The entire reception, sitting in her car, crying because Dan stood guard at the door and told her if she tried to come back in, he'd call actual security to have her removed from property. My parents tried to apologize at the reception. I walked away mid sentence. They sent emails, texts, called Logan's parents to intervene and mediate. I blocked them and ignored everything for months. Six months later, they finally wrote a real apology letter, admitting they bailed me for decades and destroyed our relationship. They asked if we could start over and rebuild. I responded, maybe when you actually treat both your daughters equally. Until then, I'm done. Brianna never apologized. Last I heard, she's still telling people I humiliated her on purpose at my wedding. Good. She humiliated me for 25 years. Turn about is fair play.

She's going, how could you do this to a child over and over again? People are staring. The flight attendant comes over, looking stressed. A woman sobbing now, telling the flight attendant I'm refusing to let her son sit with her. The flight attendant looks at me, and I just show her both boarding passes and explain I paid extra and offered to switch if she reimbursed me or moved to her own son's seat. The flight attendant's face changes. She tells the woman, ma'am, you can either take your assigned seat or switch with the passenger seated next to your son. We need to close the doors. The woman grabs her bag and storms off toward the back, still crying and muttering about how cruel people are these days. Like, two minutes later, this guy in his 20s sits down next to me, huge grin on his face. Dude, thank you so much. That kid would not stop kicking my seat during boarding, and his mom just kept saying, boys will be boys. Literally giddy about getting bumped up to Economy Plus for free. I thought it was over, but then my boyfriend text me after I land saying I was Too harsh. Apparently his mom thinks I should have just been nice and switched, because that's what good people do. And that I probably made that woman feel like a terrible mother.

I excused myself to the kitchen to start cleaning up, even though we weren't finished eating. When I came back 10 minutes later, they had eaten everything. Like everything. All the leftover chicken, all the potatoes, even the green beans, which they were complaining about earlier. My husband's plate was empty too. I just stood there staring at the empty dishes. I had barely eaten anything because I was so stressed from their comments. His mom notices me looking and goes, well, I guess it wasn't that bad after all. We were just hungry. Then she laughs like it's some big joke. I looked at my husband and he just shrugged, like literally just shrugged. Didn't say anything to defend me or acknowledge that this was messed up.

I said, yeah, well, I didn't get to eat the dinner I spent three I was making because you guys finished it all while calling me a picky eater.

Next time I'll make sure to cook enough food to feed people who complain about it the entire time and then eat all of it anyway. His mom's face went bright red and she started saying something about respect and how I was being rude in my own home. My husband finally spoke up and said, maybe we should all just calm down. His parents left pretty quickly after that.

I looked over, walked to the gift table, retrieved my envelope with a 7,500 dollar fun check, and said, I think you won't need this anymore. Then I left. My brother ran after me, and my parents shouted, come back! The envelope sat there on the gift table, plain white, bent at the corner. Inside was a 7,500 dollar check I'd saved for months. Extra shifts, vacations, saying no to things I wanted. All of it. I told Ryan weeks earlier I had something big planned. He'd called me late one night, voice tight, saying, Mel, I don't know how we're going to afford the honeymoon. I said, don't worry, I've got you. At the reception, check in. The woman handed me a paper badge. Not gold trimmed like everyone else's, just white, flimsy, printed in thick black. Limited access guest. My mom appeared beside me. That means no plate, she whispered, then walked off before I could respond. I checked the seating chart. My name wasn't listed. Not at the family table, not anywhere. I wasn't a guest. I was a placeholder they forgot to remove. I'd driven two hours to get here, bought a new dress, taken the day off work. All of it for nothing. I stood near the wall, watching Ryan toast, watching my parents clap, watching everyone settle in. My aunt was laughing at Something someone said. My cousins were taking selfies at their table. They saw me. They just didn't care. So I walked back to the gift table, opened my envelope, pulled out the check, and said, loud enough, I think you won't need this anymore. Chairs scraped. Someone shouted my name. Ryan's voice, then my parents, both yelling, come back! Come back! I didn't. I drove home and didn't sleep. Not from anger, but because I kept seeing that paper badge in my hands. By morning, the text started. Can we talk? Please don't make this a thing. No apologies, just deflection.

Your brother's here, too. I went, not to fix anything, just to watch them squirm. They were all in the living room when I arrived. My dad said it was unfortunate how things went.

I stood. I need time to think. I left them with that word, my buzzing in their ears. For once, they wanted something from me. Three days later, my mom called. They were delaying the honeymoon. No check, no trip. That's when I remembered. I'd loaned them my second car six months ago. It was still in my name, still on my insurance. They'd said it was temporary, a week or two while theirs was in the shop. That was in March. It was now September. I scheduled a tow for Friday morning. 9 12 a m, my phone rang. My mom, there's someone outside towing the car. Did you do this? Yes. I said, silence. Why? I'm changing insurance companies. She said they needed the car. I said, then maybe you should rent one. That's what I'd have to do, right? This is about the wedding, isn't it? No. I said, this is about patterns. I hung up. That afternoon, a text from someone I didn't know. This is Kiara's cousin. I helped organize the wedding. You were originally listed as family. Full access, seated with your parents and Ryan. Three days before the wedding, your Mom changed it. She emailed a revised list. Ryan approved it. I remember thinking it felt wrong, but I figured it was a family thing. They knew Ryan saw my name on the original list and let them move me. They wanted the envelope, not me. I deleted the family group chat, blocked my parents, muted Ryan's number. Two days later, my dad tried again. Family is complicated. We all make mistakes. We love you. No apology, just excuses. I didn't reply. I opened the file labeled loan terms and deleted it. A week later, Ryan's fiance texted. I don't know what happened, but I still think you did the right thing. I replied, thank you. Two months later, Ryan sent one message. I miss you. I read it. Then I blocked his number. They didn't lose a daughter. They lost access to my generosity.

Oh, it's exactly what it sounds like. I held up printed photos. Her and Bradley at the Marriott. Her mom's hand went to her mouth. You've been sleeping with your lawyer and plotting to sell my house. Proof, time stamps, audio, everything. Rebecca screamed. You hired someone to follow me? That's illegal. Recording a fraud scheme. Totally legal. Her sister Nicole muttered, Becca, what the hell? Rebecca snapped, shut up! Tom's loaded. He can afford it. That house is half mine anyway. Eight months, I said. You've lived there eight months, paid zero rent, contributed nothing. You don't own a brick. I pulled out an envelope. You've been served eviction notice. Got 30 days to get out. Your things are already packed. Dennis and Mike are loading the truck right now. Storage unit on Riverside. First month's on me. She lunged at me. Her mom and sister had to grab her. You can't do this. We're engaged. Not anymore. I said calmly. Weddings canceled. Venue vendors all notified an hour ago. And Bradley's wife? She got copies of everything. That shut her up. Her mom, Started crying. Guests gathered. Someone yelled, holy shit! As I walked out. By the time I got home, Rebecca's ring was on the dresser. The PI texted, Bradley's wife just called his office. He's finished. I poured a drink, opened my blinds, and watched the movers haul her boxes away. That's how I ended an engagement, exposed two frauds, and kept my house. All in one afternoon.

Come to my office tomorrow morning with your records. Bring your roommate. Kira jumped up, knocking over the Polish bottle. Pink liquid spread across the carpet. You're seriously calling the cops? You stole $2,550 from me and almost destroyed my future, I said coldly. What did you expect? The next morning, we sat in my landlord's office. Kira's parents were on speaker phone.

Look. $850 on the first of every month. September, October, November. My landlord squinted at my screen. Why are you sending money to Kira? You both pay me separately. I looked at him all confused. Kira said it would be easier if I sent her my half and she'd bundle both payments together. He shook his head. I never agreed to that. Kira pays her part on time every month. But I haven't gotten a dollar from you since August. My heart rate went up, and it wasn't because of the caffeine. I'd worked two jobs to never miss a payment for this room. The eviction letters, I whispered. Kira said they were billing mistakes. She told me she'd handle it. My landlord shook his head. Those definitely weren't mistakes. No payment by Friday means I have to file eviction papers. Three months times $850. I had pocketed $2,550 and never sent a cent to the landlord. My coffee spilled as I stood up, but I didn't care.

I gave him two candy canes and told him to give one to someone who looked like they needed cheering up. By closing time, word had spread about Steve Claus. The mall manager asked if I could come back tomorrow. Parents were specifically requesting Santa's brother. Brenda offered me $500 for the week. My girlfriend found me still in costume, surrounded by children and took about 50 photos while laughing hysterically. I worked that entire week as claws. Kids would bring drawings of what they imagine the whole claws family look like. One boy brought cookies specifically for me, not Santa. A girl gave me a handmade business card that said assistant to make my job sound more official. On Christmas Eve, my last shift, the original Santa showed up. He'd heard about Steve Claus and came to see what the fuss was about. We took a photo together, told kids we were heading back to help Santa with a big night. The crowd applauded. That mall still has a Steve Claus every year now. It became their thing. I set the precedent, and now some other bearded guy continues the tradition. Last week, a teenager recognized me at a coffee shop. You're the original Steve Claus, he said. Turns out he was Tyler the Kid who exposed me that first day, he said that Christmas was his favorite because he got to be part of creating a new legend.

A whole shipment of game consoles got delivered to the wrong warehouse. I need to take notes on what everyone wants while he fixes it. Tyler's eyes widened. Santa has a brother? I nodded solemnly. Someone has to run the workshop while he's delivering presents. I usually stay at the North Pole, but this is an emergency. Line of children buzzed with excitement. They'd met Santa's brother. This was even better than regular Santa. For the next three hours, I became Steve Claus. I told kids about my workshop specializing in unusual toys. I explained how I invented the self wrapping present. One girl asked why I wasn't famous like Santa, and I said I preferred working behind the scenes. Some. No one has to test all those video games. I winked. Parents started taking pictures, posting about meeting Santa's mysterious brother. Kids asked increasingly creative questions, and I made up an entire Claus family history. There was Uncle Pete, who trained the reindeer, Cousin Maria, who designed the slay's GPS system, and Grandma Claus, who quality tested all the cookies. Around hour four, a kid with thick glasses approached. My dad says Santa isn't real. He said quietly. The crowd went silent. This was the moment every mall Santa dreaded. I knelt down to his level.

Last December I was killing time at the mall, waiting for my girlfriend to finish her shift at the jewelry store, when a tiny woman in an elf costume grabbed my arm. you have to help me, she whispered, her fake pointed ears drooping. Santa just quit mid shift and there are 40 kids in line. I'm 6 foot 4 with a beard I've been growing since October. She looked at me like I was the answer to her prayers. I don't know anything about being Santa, I protested. She was already dragging me toward the North Pole setup. Can you say ho ho, ho and not swear in front of children? When I nodded, she said, you're hired. Before I could object, she shoved me into a break room where a red suit hung on a chair, still warm from the previous Santa. He left because the kid threw up on him, she explained, tossing me the pants. Third time this week. I should have run, but she looked so desperate, and somewhere outside, children were waiting. The suit was too small, the jacket barely closed, the pants ended at my calves, and the beard kept sliding sideways. The elf, who introduced herself as Brenda, looked me over and sighed. It'll have to do. Just remember, every kid gets a candy cane, no promises about specific gifts, and absolutely no holding babies. My first kid was easy. A shy five year old who whispered she wanted a Dinosaur. I deepened my voice, said something about checking my list, and sent her off with a candy cane. I thought I had this figured out. Then came Tyler. Tyler was seven, tactical, and armed with questions. Why does your beard smell like coffee? He demanded. How do you fit down chimneys if you're so fat? Before I could answer, he pulled my beard down and announced to the entire line, this isn't the real Santa. Panic spread through the crowd. Parents glared.

When I was 14, I'd already figured out how life worked. You don't expect anything from anyone, and you don't get disappointed. Simple math. My dad left when I was, like, two. I don't even remember his face. My mom was around, technically, but most nights she'd be knocked out on the couch with a bottle next to her, and I'd just make myself ramen or whatever we had left in the cupboard. At school, I was basically furniture. Not bullied, not popular. Just there. I'd sit in the back, do my work, go home, repeat. I had this one hoodie I wore almost every day because it had big pockets and I could just disappear into it. Teachers knew my name, but that was about it. I was the kid who turned in assignments on time and never caused problems, so nobody really looked twice. My birthday that year was on a Tuesday. I woke up, got dressed, went to school. My mom didn't say anything because she probably didn't even know what day it was. I didn't tell anyone because what was the point? At lunch, I sat alone like always, eating the free meal they gave out. And I just thought about how this was my 14th birthday. And it felt exactly like a random Wednesday in March. Then in homeroom that morning, Miss Harmon called me over to her desk. She taught English, and I had her for Third period. But homeroom was just where they took attendance and made announcements. I walked up, thinking maybe I forgot to turn something in or messed up a paper. She had this little white box on her desk, wrapped in shiny blue paper with a silver ribbon. Hey, I think this is yours, she I said, holding it out. I just stared at it. What? It's for you. Open it. My hands were shaking a little when I took it. I didn't understand what was happening. The wrapping paper made that crinkling sound when I tore it, and inside was this tiny silver necklace with a heart charm. It wasn't fancy. Probably cost like 10 bucks at the mall, but I looked at it like someone just handed me a bar of gold. I heard you mentioned last week your birthday was coming up, Miss Harmon said, smiling. Figured you should have something to Mark the day. I don't even remember telling anyone my birthday. Maybe I said it to someone in passing or wrote it on.

Hey, Uncle Tommy, tell everyone that funny story about when you got so drunk at your son's graduation you tried to give a speech and ended up barfing on the principal's shoes. That was hilarious, right? Your son still won't talk to you, but at least you got a funny story out of it. My mom covered her mouth trying not to laugh, and my dad had to look away. At New Year's, when he tried to make a toast, I jumped up first. Let me tell a joke first. What do you call a guy who's been divorced three times, lost every business he started, and still gives relationship and financial advice? Uncle Tommy. Get it? Because it's funny how he thinks anyone should listen to him. Uncle Tommy finally lost it. You think you're so funny, don't you? He screamed at me while spit flew out of his mouth, making jokes about my divorces and my mistakes like you're some kind of comedian. It's not funny. It's just mean and disrespectful. I smiled at him, real calm. But, Uncle Tommy, you said if we can't laugh at ourselves, we'll never make it in life. I'm just helping you laugh at yourself. Why is it suddenly not funny when the jokes are about you? The whole room went dead silent, and Uncle Tommy's face looked like it might explode. Remember when you made my sister cry about her weight at her graduation? I kept going. Or that Super funny bit where you told Kim's kids their dad was too stupid to get a real job. Was that funny, Uncle Tommy? My mom stood up and crossed her arms. Yeah, Tommy, explain to us why your jokes are funny but his aren't. Uncle Tommy tried to say I was attacking him, but my dad said, now you know how your jokes feel to everyone else. Maybe you should think about. Uncle Tommy sat back down and didn't make any more mean jokes. But when he went for dessert, I said, that's your third piece of pie, Uncle Tommy. It's a good thing your new girlfriend doesn't care about your dad bought as long as you have money. Uncle Tommy just put his head down and pushed his plate away.

Uncle Tommy walked through the door and immediately came over to where I was practicing piano. Still wasting your parents money on those piano lessons? He said. Hey, everyone, listen to this. It sounds like someone's torturing a bunch of sick geese while they're trying to sing the national anthem. Oh, wait, that's just my nephew playing piano. Everyone laughed nervously, and I turned around on the bench. Uncle Tommy, that's really mean. I've been practicing for months. Could you please stop? He rolled his eyes at me. Don't be such a baby. It's just a joke. If you can't laugh at yourself, you'll never make it in life, kiddo. Then he walked over to my cousin Kim, who just got engaged last month. Hey, everyone, wanna start a betting pool? He was grinning. I give this marriage six months, tops. We all know how desperate Kim was to find anyone who would marry her. Kim's face went bright red, and her fiance looked like he wanted to leave right then. Uncle Tommy kept going, pointing at my sister. Speaking of desperation, here's our family teacher. You know what's funny about teachers? They get paid in crayon drawings and apple juice because that's all they're worth. He laughed at his own joke. At least the kids in your class have someone at their level to relate to, right? My sister ran out of the room. My Grandpa laughed. Kids really are too sensitive. Tommy's just joking around. My aunt nodded and added, it's just his sense of humor. You all need to learn to take a joke. By the time dinner was over, Kim had left early and my sister wouldn't come out of her room. At Christmas, I came ready with my own jokes about Uncle Tommy's life. He walked in wearing another expensive suit, and I announced to everyone, hey, look, everyone! Uncle Tommy wore his fancy suit! You know, the one he bought before his third wife took everything, including his house and his last bit of self respect. His eye twitched, but he laughed it off. During dinner, when he grabbed his fourth beer, I said, loud enough for

Last month I stopped at Buffalo Wild Wings after my kickboxing class. I was wearing all black compression pants, a tank top, and I hadn't showered yet. My hair was in a tight bun, and I probably looked intimidating. Whatever. I just wanted boneless wings. I'm sitting at the bar, scrolling through my phone when this guy in designer sunglasses and a baseball cap walks in. He's got that trying not to be noticed vibe that actually makes you more noticeable. He sits two seats away from me, orders a beer, and keeps glancing around nervously. Then a group of college kids spots him. One girl gasps loudly and whispers to her friends there, all staring and pulling out phones. The guy tenses up. That's when one of the girls approaches me instead of him. Excuse me, can we get a photo with him? We'll be super quick. I blink. With who? She gestures toward the guy. We know you're working, but we're huge fans. Just one picture? Oh. Oh, no. She thinks I'm his bodyguard. The guy is watching this interaction with growing panic. Before I can correct her, he gives me this desperate, pleading look. For some inexplicable reason, I make a split second decision to play along. He's off duty right now, I say in my most authoritative voice. He's trying to enjoy a private meal. The girl's face falls. We understand. Sorry. To bother you. She returns to her table, and they're all whispering excitedly about how he has a bodyguard. The guy visibly relaxes. He leans over slightly. Thank you so much. I'm sorry for dragging you into this. No problem. Though I have no idea who you are. He looks genuinely relieved. Perfect. We keep it that way. Deal. We go back to our respective phones and wings. I assume that's the end of it. Then another group approaches. This time it's three guys in fraternity shirts. Yo, is that really him? One asks me. I channel every bouncer I've ever seen at a club. Guys, he's eating. Give him some space. We just get an autograph. Not tonight. They actually back off. The guy, whoever he is, mouths, thank you again. This happens four more times over the next 30 minutes. Each time, I turn people away with various professional sounding excuses. I'm fully committed to this spit now. A manager eventually approaches me. Ma'am, we appreciate you keeping things calm, but we can't have you acting as unofficial security. It's a liability issue. Totally understand, I say. The guy overhears and immediately stands up. She's with me. We'll just get our food to go. He pays both our tabs before I can protest, and we end up standing outside in the parking lot with take out bags. I'm really sorry about all that, he says, finally taking off the sunglasses. I'm Damien. I'm on a reality show about House flipping season three just dropped, and apparently I'm having a moment. I'm Riley. I teach kickboxing and know nothing about house flipping shows. He laughs. That's probably why you were so convincing. Actual bodyguards are usually more polite. We end up sitting on the tailgate of my truck, eating wings and talking. He tells me about how weird his life got after the show aired.

I told everyone something that made the entire chapel gas. My sister Emily always acted like she was Dad's favorite. At his funeral last week, she proved it in the worst possible way. I was sitting in the front row when Emily stood up during the eulogy. The. The chapel was packed, maybe 200 people. All of Dad's friends from the veterans lodge, his old coworkers from the postal service, neighbors from the block where he'd lived for 30 years. Dad trusted me with everything, she announced, her voice echoing off the walls. I was the only one who knew his wishes. I'll be handling the estate personally. My stomach dropped. I'm a paralegal at Michelin Associates downtown, and I've been helping dad update his will for the past six months. Every Saturday morning, we'd meet at the coffee shop near his house, order black coffee and a blueberry muffin, and we'd go through everything, line by line. Emily had no idea. She kept going, her voice getting louder and more confident. Dad and I talked every single day. He told me exactly how he wanted things handled. The house, the savings account, his veterans benefits. He wanted me to oversee all of it. I glanced at my mom sitting next to me. She looked confused, her tissues crumpled in her hands. They'd been divorced for 15 years, but she'd come anyway because dad, specifically Asked her to be there. That should have been Emily's first clue. Something was off. Some people, Emily continued, her eyes landing on me for just a second, only showed up when it was convenient. But I was there for dad when it mattered. My hands started shaking. I pulled out my phone and open the documents folder. Everything was backed up there. The will, the notes from our meetings, even the text messages where dad joked about Emily's upcoming surprise. Emily was really warming up now. Dad always said family was everything to him. That's why he trusted me to carry out his legacy. I know some of you might have questions about the arrangements, but rest assured, I'll be handling everything according to his exact wishes. Her husband, Richard

So my husband has this thing where he'll text me, like, four hours before people show up and be like, my brother and his wife are coming for dinner, or the guys are coming over to watch the game, and I'm supposed to just drop everything, clean the whole house, go buy food, and cook for, like, eight people every single time. The first few times it happened, I actually did it. I'd be running around like crazy, vacuuming, scrubbing the bathroom, throwing stuff in closets. And I'd speed to the grocery store, spend, like, a hundred bucks, come back, and cook while still in my work clothes. By the time people showed up, I looked like a mess. And he'd be all relaxed, like, hey, everyone, come in! Like he did something. One time, he invited his parents and didn't tell me until I was already at target buying stuff for myself. I had to abandon my cart and go buy ingredients for his mom's favorite pot roast recipe that takes three hours to make. I literally got home with two hours left. I didn't even eat that night because I was so stressed. But the worst one was when he told me his college buddies were coming over in four hours. Four hours? It was a Saturday, and I've been planning to deep clean my closet all day. I was in old Sweats with my hair in a messy bun, no bra, looking rough. He texted me at, like, 2 in the afternoon. Hey, babe, Jake, Kevin, and Brad are coming at six. Can you grab some steaks and make that potato salad they liked last time? I just sat there staring at my phone. That potato salad takes forever because you have to boil the potatoes, let them cool, dice everything super small. Plus, our house was a disaster. There were dishes in the sink from breakfast, laundry on the couch. The bathroom hadn't been cleaned in a week. I texted back, you're inviting people in four hours? And didn't ask me first. He goes, it's not a big deal. They're chill. Yeah, they're chill because they're not the ones doing anything. They just show up, eat free food, mess up the house, and leave. So I looked around at the mess, looked at myself in the mirror, and I just grabbed my person, left. Didn't clean anything, didn't go to the store, just got in my car and drove to my sister

He threatened to fire me on the spot, but I reminded him that would be wrongful termination, since I literally did nothing wrong.

My boss sends me passive aggressive emails about office conduct and respecting co workers. It's gotten so bad that I'm genuinely thinking about quitting. Just heard about everything and offered me a full time position at the restaurant. The pay is slightly less, but at least I wouldn't have to deal with this drama every single day. Part of me feels like I shouldn't have to leave my job over this, but another part of me knows it's only gonna get worse.

They drive me everywhere and film my games for scouts. Doctor him studied my scans. These injuries aren't new. You have damage we see in athletes who've played professionally for 20 years. How long has your shoulder hurt? Maybe three years. But I didn't want to stop. My parents gave up everything to help me succeed. I couldn't disappoint them. Doctor Hims looked at me for a long moment, almost like he didn't know what to say. You've been playing on a damaged older for three years because you didn't want to let your parents down. He went quiet again and then started asking even more questions, though I don't know why. When did you last play without pain? I couldn't remember. When did you last take a day off? Maybe Christmas. Two years ago. What Do you do for fun besides volleyball? I don't have time for fun. But that's okay. My parents are helping me build my future. Doctor Hims pulled up pictures from my surgery. Your bones are still growing. This damage is going to be permanent. You need eight months off, minimum. Even then, your shoulder will never work the same. Mom's head snapped up from her phone. Eight months? Her voice was cold. That's the entire recruiting season. Doctor Hims nodded. Exactly. She needs to rest, no matter what. No, no, no! Mom yelled. That can't happen. Everything we've built is riding on her. I couldn't help but look down when I heard that. Already feeling guilty. Mom, dad, I'm so sorry about this. I should have known better. Doctor him stared at my parents. Your daughter has permanent damage to her body, and she's apologizing to you. Apologizing is the least she can do. Dad screamed, standing up to glare at Doctor Hims. Do you have any idea what we sacrificed? Doctor Hims looked at him carefully. What exactly did you sacrifice? Everything mom stood up to. We quit our jobs. Both of us. We gave up study.

So my girlfriend Jess and I decided to get married after dating for, like, four years. We're not fancy people. We both work regular jobs, live in a small apartment, and honestly just wanted something simple, like maybe 40 people, some pizza, drinks, done. No stress, no drama. Just us actually enjoying the day instead of performing for everyone else. When we told our families, they seemed cool with it. At first, my mom was like, oh, that sounds nice. And Jess's dad just nodded and said, whatever makes you happy. We thought we were in the clear. Then the check started showing up. My aunt sent us $500. Guess his grandma gave us 1,000. My dad's brother, who I barely talk to, sent 300. It was weird, but also kind of amazing because we could actually upgrade from the community center to this nice barn venue. We saw, we were pumped. That's when everything went sideways. My aunt called and said since she gave us money, she needed to bring her new boyfriend and his two kids, people we've literally never met. Then my mom said, if we're inviting aunt's boyfriend, we need to invite my cousin Brett, who I haven't spoken to in six years cause he stole my Xbox and never gave it back. Jesse's uncle demanded we serve steak instead of Chicken. Because he didn't give us money for people to eat. Bird. Her grandma said the color scheme had to be purple and gold because that's what her wedding colors were. Then it got worse. My dad told us his friend's daughter, Emma had to be a bridesmaid because they gave us money, too. Emma is nice, but she's not even

Lynette walked onto that massive stage, looking tiny in her formal dress. She sat at the grand piano and looked at me. I nodded back. Then she took a deep breath and started playing let it go from frozen. But she played it badly. Really badly. Wrong notes everywhere. Completely off rhythm. But she was smiling. For the first time in months, my daughter was smiling. She even started singing along quietly, forgetting hundreds of people were watching. The judges looked confused. The audience shifted uncomfortably as the terrible music assaulted their ears. Vince turned white, then red, then purple. And I swore I saw fumes coming out of his head. She finished with a flourish, stood up and actually took a bow. The scattered, confused applause was the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard. Vince exploded in the parking lot. You told her to do that? He was right. But I didn't care anymore. Three months of my time, my money. I lost $50,000 because of you. He grabbed Lynette's shoulders. You're done with piano? Done. I'm selling it tomorrow. That's when Lynette said something that changed everything. Good, she said, looking him straight in the eye. I hate piano now. You made me hate the thing I loved. Most, she pulled out her little notebook where she used to write songs. I wanted to compose music when I grew up, like the Disney movies. But now I can't even listen to piano without feeling sick. She threw the notebook in the trash. Thanks for ruining my dream, daddy. The silence that followed was deafening. Even Vince seemed stunned.

I begged him to let her have just one day off. The competition is in two weeks. He scream. You wanna throw away $50,000? As days passed, Lynette stopped smiling entirely. She'd sit at the piano like a robot, playing the same advanced piece over and over. Her little fingers could barely reach all the keys. One night, I found her trying to tape her fingers straight because they hurt too much to bend. Mommy, if I win, will daddy be happy? She asked. Will he let me stop? My heart shattered. I held her while she sobbed. It's okay, sweetheart. That's when Vince found us and yanked Lynette away from me. Stop filling her head with weakness. He has to practice. I knew this couldn't go on, and I knew I had to do something soon or risk losing my daughter. The day of the competition arrived. There were 500 kids from across the country, and Linette was the youngest in her division. When we were backstage, I comforted her because she kept throwing up from all the nerves. Vinsten care at all. It's just stage fright. She'll be fine. I cleaned her face and held Her close other parents stared as Vince paced, calculating the prize money out loud.

This is our ticket, he kept saying, eyes glued to his laptop, showing past winners. I tried to reason with him. Vince, she. He's not ready for this level. He slammed his hand on the table in anger. She either wins or she quits piano forever. I'm not paying for a hobby. This is an investment. You see, Lynette loved piano. She play Disney songs after school, making up little dances as she went. But now Vince had her practicing six hours a day. No friends, no TV, no playing outside. Daddy, my fingers hurt, Lynette whispered during dinner once winners don't complain, Vince shot back. You think those kids on stage got there by whining? I reached for Lynette's hand, but Vince grabbed my wrist. Don't baby her. She needs to toughen up. The next three months were literal hell. Lynette would have to wake up at 5:00am to practice before school. Her teacher ended up quitting because Vince screamed at her for wasting time on basics. Then he hired someone he found online who claimed to train competition champions. This new teacher made Lynette play the same piece 50 times in a row. If she made one mistake, she'd start Over.

I was working at target, like, 30 hours a week while taking a full class load because my financial aid barely covered tuition. My roommate Becca didn't have a job. Her parents paid for everything, including her meal plan that she never used because she'd rather order Chipotle three times a day or apparently just steal my food. I'd spend my one day off making chicken and rice or pasta or whatever I could afford in bulk, stored in containers on my shelf in our dorm fridge. We had assigned shelves. Mine was the bottom one with my name on a piece of duct tape. But I'd get back from my closing shift at, like, 10:30 at night, exhausted and starving, and my containers would either be gone or scraped clean in the sink. Worst part is, I'd walk in and catch them eating it. Becca and usually two or three of her friends from down the hall would be sitting on our futon with my food. One time, this girl Vanessa, literally said, oh, my god, this is so good. You should make more next time while eating my chicken Alfredo that I'd plan to eat for three days. I told her to stop. I told all of them to stop. Becca would just laugh and say, it's just food. Don't be dramatic. Started labeling my containers with my name in Sharpie. Didn't Matter. I tried hiding stuff in the back of the fridge behind old takeout containers. They'd find it. I even bought a mini fridge for our room, but Becca unplugged it one day because she said it was too loud while she was napping. I was losing weight because I literally couldn't afford to keep replacing the food they ate. I started eating granola bars for dinner some nights because I was too broke.

I'd say, Mia, clean your room. And she'd look at me dead in the face like, hi, it's my room. You don't even sleep here, girl. What? I pay rent, little one. Her room looked like an explosion at a toy factory. Markers without caps, Cheeto dust on her ceiling fan. There was a banana peel inside a dollhouse. Even the goldfish was judging her. One day, I had enough. I walk in, step on a plastic unicorn, fall dramatically like I got shot, and scream, that's it! I'm calling the cleaning police! She blinks and goes, tell him to bring snacks. I stared at her for a full five seconds like I was on Dateline. Then something in me snapped. I grabbed a blanket, wrapped it around me like a cloak, put my hair in a messy bun that looked like a squirrel nest, and stormed in like a possessed raccoon. Mia, I growled, you have awoken the cleaning spirit. She screamed and ran behind the bed. Mom, what are You doing? I start chanting fake Latin. Clorox is Maximus, sock is banished, dust is begone. She's crying from laughing, yelling ah! But I'm in too deep. I pull out a swiffer like it's a sword and start fake fighting the mess like you shall not pass dirty laundry.

They laughed and said thanks for the wedding present. I smiled and told them to check their mail. Their faces froze when they saw it. The lake house. My grandfather left me with everything. Three acres on Lake Winnipesaukee. Built with his own hands. Filled with summers of my childhood. While my sister Hannah complained it was boring. When Grandpa Jack died six years ago, his will was crystal clear. The property went to me. My parents looked shocked. Hannah threw a fit. Why does she get it all even though she barely visited after age 12? I should have seen the pattern. When Hannah wanted ballet lessons, they paid. When I wanted architecture camp, I babysat for tuition. When she crashed her first car, they replaced it. When I needed college textbooks, I worked two jobs. Fast forward to Hannah's engagement. Suddenly her small wedding ballooned to three hundred guests at an exclusive resort. A fifteen thousand dollar French dress. A fifteen thousand dollar photographer, gold Flake desserts. My parents looked increasingly stressed. When I offered to contribute a few thousand, dad waved me off. We have it under control. Then Dorothy Matthews, my lake house neighbor, called. Audrey, dear, I wanted to check about the sale. Will you still visit? My blood went cold. What sale? I drove three hours to find a moving truck. A couple the Peterson's standing in my driveway. We bought this property three weeks ago, Robert Peterson said, showing me documents from Thomas and Elizabeth Whitaker. There was my parents signatures and mine. Poorly forged. They'd sold my 550,000 dollar property for 375,000 dollar cash. Below market. Fast closing. The deposit hit their account the same day Hannah posted about her dress. Then I noticed something worse. 3 failed attempts to access my bank account from an unknown IP address. They hadn't just stolen my house. They tried stealing my savings, too. I called my attorney friend Stephanie. They forged my signature stuff. They sold my house to pay for Hannah's wedding. That's fraud. Criminal fraud. Do you want them arrested? I thought about it. Not yet. Hannah's wedding is in three weeks. Let them have their Celebration. Then we strike. I attended every pre wedding event, smiled through the engagement party where they publicly thanked me for my generosity. Cataloged

By the end, they were just hoping I was safe. The moment I finished reading, they knew I was online. Messages started flooding in. They kept apologizing and saying they had no idea what was going to happen. I was confused, so I asked them to explain what actually happened. Apparently, they were planning a normal surprise party. Sabrina had added some of her college friends to the group group chat, saying they wanted to meet me. One of her college friends suggested doing a prank first. The plan was a fake serial killer in costume attacking Sabrina with a prop knife. They'd capture my reaction, then everyone would surprise me with gifts. My friends agreed, as long as it was quick and harmless. On my birthday, Sabrina's college friends told everyone to hide while they set up. When they heard Sabrina say to come out, they thought it worked because I looked mortified. But even after they revealed it was a prank, think I still looked devastated. Then I just left. That's when they realised something was wrong. The guy wasn't wearing any costume. He wasn't holding any prop knife. He was just on top of my girlfriend in a way that looked completely real. They saw Sabrina push him off and chase after me. Even Sabrina's other college friends were confused why their friend wasn't in costume. He stood there silent. After a few minutes, Sabrina came back crying and told Everyone to leave! She went into our bedroom, and the guy followed her in. Then they heard her screaming at him through the door. Get the fuck out! I told you not to do this! He came out looking like he was about to cry and left immediately. My friends tried reaching me, but I turned off my phone. Sabrina's college friends sent long apologies and videos proving their story. You could see their genuine confusion in the footage. After reading everything, I apologized for disappearing and told them it wasn't their fault. They asked if they could throw me a real birthday Celebration this weekend. Just us, no Sabrina. I agreed. Two days later, I opened Sabrina's messages. He sent over 50 texts. The first ones were angry, calling me dramatic. But then they shifted to desperate apologies, begging me to come home. The last message was from this morning. I'm coming to get you. Your uncle's address is still in my GPS. I showed my uncle. He just shook his head and said, she's not welcome here. I blocked her number.

When I came home and opened the door, I froze. There was a random man lying on top of my girlfriend on our couch. They were tangled together, and for a split second, time just stopped. When she saw me. She jumped up fast and got between me and the door as I turned to leave. It's just a prank, sweetheart, she said, grabbing my arm. Look, out of nowhere, ten of her friends came downstairs holding a cake, and they were all smiling like this was the funniest thing in the world. I was crying because I genuinely thought I just walked in on her cheating. My hands were shaking. I couldn't breathe. But my girlfriend's smile faded fast. I know you said you didn't want a party, but don't you think this is cool? I kept crying. I couldn't stop. That's when she got aggressive. Oh, my god, stop being so sensitive. It was just a prank. I put all this effort in so you could have a fun time, and you're crying like a baby. I immediately pushed her out of the way and walked out. I got in my car and just drove. My phone started blowing up with Texts and calls. When it got too distracting, I turned it off complete. I ended up at a hotel about an hour away. The moment I got to my room, I just broke down. I couldn't stop thinking about my dad cheating on my mom when I was a kid. How it destroyed our family. The next morning, I called my team leader and told her I needed a few days off. My voice was weak and I was still sniffling. She just told me to take care of myself. I went to my uncle's house. He's always been more of a father to me than my actual dad. When I got there, he gave me a tight hug and said I was always welcome. Helped me unpack, and told me to stay as long as I needed. After settling in, I knew I had to face my phone. When I turned it on, I had over 100 messages. I opened our friend group chat first. At the beginning, everyone was asking where I was, but as I scrolled, the tone changed. They started apologizing, saying the prank wasn't supposed to happen like that. One friend even blamed the

When I entered his office, he was grinning, talking about the announcement for Friday's gala. The board was thrilled. I asked if he was sure about the timing. He nodded firmly, explaining his plans for my brother. My brother would run the charitable foundation. My dad said he needs to learn humility, and what better way than to serve the community? I thought about Jessica's smug face at lunch. Dad, that sounds like a perfect plan. But until Friday, I still had some cleaning up to do. Tuesday afternoon, dad called. Your brother just charged $3,500 to the company card at a strip club. He told the client it was a business lunch. Jessica had texted me that morning. Can't wait to see you Friday. My future husband's going to make

When I was 10 years old, my mom married this guy who had money, like actual money. My brother Josh was 15 at the time. The guy already had two daughters, Amy and Ada, who were 12 and 11. Here's where it gets stupid. My mom was working minimum wage at a grocery store and our real dad wasn't in the picture. But our new stepdad had this whole financial setup where he and my mom would split everything, 50, 50 for the house. Then whatever was left over they'd use for their own kids. Sounds fair until you realize my mom had nothing left over ever. So while Amy and Ada were going on trips to Disney World and getting new clothes every season, Josh and I were wearing hand me downs and staying home. The worst part wasn't even that, though. He had to share one bedroom in a four bedroom house because my stepdad said since he paid more of the mortgage, my mom's contribution only covered one room for her kids. Amy and Ada each had their own rooms and there was still a whole guest room that just sat empty. They made fun of us constantly, all three of them. Amy would come back from vacation and show us pictures while we were eating store brand cereal for Dinner, Ada would complain about how her room wasn't big enough while Josh and I were literally stepping over each other's stuff every morning. And my stepdad would just laugh like it was all some big joke. My mom's response whenever we complained was always the same, be grateful. If it wasn't for him, we'd be living in some apartment in a bad area, as if being treated like second class citizens in our own house was supposed to be a privilege. Josh and I made a promise to each other when I was about 14, we were going to get out and we were never going to need anything from anyone ever again. We both worked our butts off. He got into tech and I went into finance. By the time I was 25, I owned my own house, no mortgage. Josh did the same.

Like, actually nauseous. He was holding the mug up to his face, about to take a sip, and then he just stopped, put it down, and stared at it. Then he picked it back up and smelled it. His face went from confused to horrified in, like, two seconds. He got up, walked fast to the break room, and I followed at a distance. He dumped the coffee in the sink, rinsed the mug under the water for maybe five seconds, and then just left it there and walked out. He grabbed his jacket and left the office. Just straight up went home early. People were still complaining about the smell for the rest of the day. Someone opened all the windows. Facilities came by to check the vents. One guy said it smelled like a corpse microwaved in fish oil, which honestly was the most accurate description I'd heard all day. Nobody could figure out where it was coming from, because by then, the mug was just sitting in the sink, and the smell had kind of spread everywhere. I waited until everyone went home, washed my mug with actual soap this time, and took it back to my desk, put it in my drawer. The next day, Mark came in with a paper cup from the coffee shop downstairs. And the day after that, and the day after that, he never touched the kitchen mugs again. I started leaving mine back on the shelf after a Week and he wouldn't even look at it. Few days later I was talking to some co workers near the coffee machine and I just casually mentioned how gross it is when people use other people's stuff without asking. How you never know what germs or whatever could be on there. A couple people agreed, and one of them looked right at Mark when they said it. He still drinks from paper cups now. Been months.

Sophia would make excuses and eventually tell her family we broke up. Then three weeks later, my phone started blowing up.

The photos showed her at a romantic beach proposal. And the man in every single photo, down on one knee, was me. Except I'd never been to that beach. Someone had photoshopped my face onto another man's body. In every picture, the announcement listed our wedding date is three months away. It had registry links. My phone rang. Unknown number. Liam. Sophia's voice was shaking. I can explain. Please don't call my family. You photoshopped me into your engagement photos? I panicked. After the dinner, my mom wouldn't stop planning the beach. Trip. Then everyone expected me to be engaged, too. I couldn't admit I'd hired you, so I said we got engaged. I sat there processing this. Sophia, this is fraud. This is identity theft. No, it got out of hand. But I need your help one more time. My family wants to meet for an engagement dinner next week. I'll pay you $2,000. Just one more dinner. Then we can stage a breakup.

I live in Colorado and about two years ago I went to Hawaii for like a week with my girlfriend. Best trip of my life, honestly.

It was bright blue with this volcano design on it, and I straight up took a Sharpie and wrote my name on the bottom because I didn't want anyone taking it. At work. I kept it in the office kitchen on the shelf with everyone else's stuff. This guy Mark, who worked in accounting kept using it. Like every single day I'd come in for coffee and my mug would be sitting in the sink with dried coffee rings or sometimes just left out on the counter. First time it happened I figured maybe he didn't know it was mine, so I just washed it and put it back. Second time I was annoyed but didn't say anything. Third time I walked up to him in the break room and said, hey man, that's actually my mug. Could you not use it? He looked at me, smiled like I just told the dumbest joke ever, and said, dude, it just a mug. Then he turned around and walked back to his desk with his coffee still in my mug. I asked him two more times that week. Same response every time. Just a mug. No big deal. Stop being weird about it. One time he even said, maybe don't leave it in a shared space then, which pissed me off because literally everyone leaves their mugs there and nobody steals them except him.

Must be comfortable with light PDA and convincing backstory. $400 cash for four hours. I've done stranger jobs before. This seemed easy. I texted the number and got a response immediately. The woman who walked in was maybe 28, with shoulder length blonde hair and nervous energy. Her name was Sophia and she needed a fake boyfriend for her sister's engagement party that weekend. Her entire family had been pressuring her about being single while her younger sister was getting married. She pulled out 4 hundred dollar bills, half now, half after. She's spent the next hour drilling me on our fake relationship back story. We've been dating for eight months after meeting at a bookstore. She made me memorize her birthday, her favorite foods, her cat's names. She warned me that her brother in law, Daniel, was suspicious, would try to trip me up. Saturday arrived and I showed up wearing the button down shirt Sophia had requested. She grabbed my hand, her palm sweaty. Just remember, we're in love and you think my family is great. The restaurant was expensive, Mom. Catherine stood up and Pulled Sophia into a hug, then turned to me with an assessing look. So you're the mystery boyfriend. The interrogation started immediately. Catherine wanted to know where I grew up, what my parents did, my five year plan. Sophia's dad Gerald asked about my job and income. It felt like a job interview. I stuck to the backstory. About an hour in, Daniel started asking pointed questions about how we met. He wanted specifics. I stayed calm and described a bookstore I actually visited regularly, the dinner drag.

My body thrashed around on the grass and suddenly the world was spinning. But I got up because that's what I was told to always do. Mom saw me holding my head after the game and smiled when she saw there were just scratches and bruising. Everyone gets bumps. You'll be fine, she said before handing me an ice pack. But she was wrong. I was far from being fine. At practice. I started getting dizzy during Prince and had to hug the goal post just to stay standing. Every time I headed the ball. I felt like throwing up from the pain. When my assistant coach noticed, he had me sit out during practice. Huge mistake. When mom saw I wasn't playing, she got angry at me and the assistant coach, saying, she's just being dramatic. Are you seriously going to believe a 13 year old more than her own mom? Fortunately, he did. He started making these little adjustments during practice to help me out. During warm UPS, he saw me stumbling. He'd call me over to help analyze plays instead of doing drills. Instead of doing heading drills, he'd have me organized equipment in the shade. This is also super important, he'd say with a wink. And on days where my head pounded so hard I could barely see straight, he'd let me rest in his office with ice packs, telling everyone else I was Doing water refill duty for the team. And each time, he'd still Mark me as a full participant on the attendance sheet so mom wouldn't know. But when it was finally time for the tournament, he couldn't shield me any longer. Mom, I can't go, I said. When she came to wake me up, she yanked the covers off my bed. We paid for this tournament, booked hotels. Your team needs you. Get up! I forced myself to sit on the edge of my bed, trying to focus on her face while the room spun like a washing machine. I feel dizzy, and I keep seeing black dots, I admitted. No, stop it! That whining is not gonna work on me today. Get your uniform now! She started shoving my gear into my soccer bag, muttering about how my team was counting on me. When she pulled me up by my arm, saying she was done with my lazy attitude. I stood up for a second before collapsing on the floor of my bedroom. Mom went from angry to terrified in about half a second, screaming for dad to call 9 1 1 while she shook my body trying to keep me awake. In the emergency room, the doctor asked mom how long I've been having symptoms. He said, I just started complaining that morning. But when the doctor did a scan and found a two week old concussion, he frowned at my mom. If your daughter had taken another Hit like this, we might be discussing funeral arrangements instead of treatment plans. That somehow woke her up. I was luckily back on the field and fully recovered two months later, but things were a lot different. Anytime I mention my head feeling even remotely weird, mom would pull me from practice immediately. It's pretty nice. I just wish it didn't take almost losing my life for it to happen.

We started meeting for coffee before market set up, but really, we were just building something beautifully uncomplicated together. Looking at the context in the section you want revised, here's a more dramatic version. One random Wednesday afternoon, while Luke and I were testing recipes for a new sourdough blend in my tiny kitchen, someone started pounding on my apartment door like they for trying to break it down. I opened it to find my aunt standing there, her face flushed and desperate. She'd somehow tracked me down after six months of nothing. Don't you dare close this door, she said, pushing past me into my kitchen. Tanya's marriage lasted three hours. Three hours. Cecil absolutely lost it at the reception about the cake flavor being wrong. Started screaming at her in front of 200 guests. Called her stupid, worthless, pathetic. Sound familiar? He grabbed her wrist so hard it left bruises. Shook her while she sobbed in her wedding dress. Her dad had to physically pull him off while everyone just sat there horrified. She breathing hard, staring at me like I should be saying something. The whole family knows you were right. Now, Tanya has been staying with your parents for two weeks, crying constantly. She keeps saying she should have believed you. Good for her. I said flatly, going, Back to my dough. My aunt grabbed my arm. Are you seriously this cold? Tanya needs you. She's going through exactly what you went through. No, I said pulling away. When I went through it, I had to do it alone because my whole family called me dramatic. Tanya called me jealous. You all picked him. We made a mistake. You made a choice. Interrupted setting down his dough. You had photos of bruises. You had voice mails. You had proof. You chose not to believe her. My aunt turned on him. Who the hell are you to judge us? You don't know our family. I know enough, Luke said calmly. I know you called her dramatic and jealous. I know you blocked her on social media when she tried to warn you Tanya was in love. We thought you thought I was lying, I said quietly. Even with evidence, even with bruises. You thought I was making it up for attention. My aunt's face crumpled. We want to make it right. Tanya needs her cousin. She needs someone who understands. She had someone who understood. She chose Cecil instead. Please. Your mother cries every night. Your father can keep crying. I finished. I have work to do.

I tried to tell you, I said quietly, standing up from the kids table and straightening my tie multiple times. But every time I mentioned the hospital, you assumed I meant volunteering at the gift shop. I paused, looked around to make sure everyone was listening, and told them once and for all.

That night, I received 17 apology texts, 12 LinkedIn requests from relatives, and three offers to catch up over coffee.

For 10 years, I've hosted the Meat Extravaganza, a legendary backyard BBQ where friends and family compete for trophies, best sauce, best brisket, best ribs. Everyone marks their calendars months in advance. Two days before the event, my brother drops a bomb. He's bringing his new vegan girlfriend and expects me to create an entire vegan menu for her. I'm all for accommodating people, but this is literally called the meat extravaganza. The invitations have cartoon steaks on them. I half jokingly suggested she could eat the garnishes, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles off the burgers. My brother exploded, called me rude and exclusionary. I reminded him this tradition has been the same for a decade, and asking me to add a full vegan spread 48 hours before was insane. I offered a compromise. She could bring her own food, and I'd set up a separate grill just for her. Clean greats, dead kated space, everything she'd need. He got more offended, said I was segregating her food and making her an outsider. At this point, I'm losing my mind because I genuinely tried to accommodate someone I never even met. My dad said I should just bend the rules this once. That pushed me over the edge. I snapped that I'd done enough, and if she wanted to come, she could lick the lettuce off my plate. When I Was done. My brother's face turned purple. He marched outside to where I'd spent three hours setting up my grill station and put it upside down. Charcoal everywhere, plates shattered, perfectly seasoned meat in the dirt. I didn't get angry, I just started laughing. The whole thing was so absurdly childish. After he stormed off, I cleaned up and formed a plan. A beautiful, petty plan. I went to the store and bought realistic plant based burger patties and regular beef patties that looked almost identical when my plan was simple but perfect. Barbecue day arrives. Weather's perfect, grill is smoking, everyone's having an amazing time. Three hours in, there's this weird tension because my brother and his girlfriend still haven't shown up. People kept asking if they were actually coming. Finally, a bright green prius pulls into my driveway, outsteps my brother and his girlfriend. Rail thin, covered in tattoos, greasy dyed hair, wearing a meet is murder tank top. I walked up with my

She said because I asked her not to sleep at her gay best friend's house. I replied, breathe all you want. When she came back, her stuff was in bags. Her gay best friend's wife called me to thank me. My girlfriend Nadine reconnected with her college friend Dmitri three months ago. He's like my gay best friend. We used to have sleepovers all the time. Then the sleepover started again. First time after a wine night, she called, tipsy, too drunk to drive, crashing at me tree. Second time after a concert. Third time was last Tuesday. No drinking, no event. Just lost track of time talking. I spoke up. I'm not comfortable with the frequent sleepovers. She laughed. Are you serious? He's gay. Gold star are gay. He showed me his Grindr profile. I get that, but it's inappropriate to regularly sleep at another person's house when you're in a relationship. She exploded. You're so controlling, I can't even breathe. This is toxic masculinity. Wednesday she went again without telling me. Just texted. Staying at D's since apparently I need permission now. Thursday morning at the gym, a guy asks to borrow my charger. While waiting, he's making small talk. My wife's going to kill me. Phone died and I didn't text her I was staying late at work. Better to overcommunicate, right? For real. Last time she thought I was at my buddy Dimitri's place playing poker. Had to show Her Uber receipts. My brain stuttered. Dimitri? Yeah. He wanted me to invite people for next week's poker night. You play your friend Dimitri? Tall guy in the theater? That's him. You know him? My girlfriend's best friend is named Dimitri. She hangs out with him a lot. Dude went quiet, bro. Dimitri is married to my cousin Elena. Been together six years. Married? Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name? Nadine. His face changed on laughs really loud. She stays over there sometimes. I nodded, man. Ellen has been in Greece for a month. Her mom's sick. And Dimitri is not gay. Definitely not gay. Used to be a player before Elena. I sat in my car for an hour, everything clicking into place. Drove home, called in sick, packed all her stuff. Clothes folded neat, everything in bags by the door. Texted her at 2:50 p m. Your stuff is by the door. You have 30 minutes. What? You can't just kick me out.

Dad, where were you when mom got hurt? My voice came out strange. He wouldn't meet my eyes. Started mumbling about errands and losing track of time. But I'd seen that look before. The guilt, the panic. The way he kept rubbing his hands like he was trying to wash something off. You followed them. You saw them in my car and you followed them. I back away from him. It wasn't supposed to happen like this. He broke down completely. He admitted he'd been paranoid about mom leaving him. So he put a tracker on my Tesla months ago. Then he saw her driving somewhere unusual and followed. He found her meeting with someone he didn't recognize. A man. They talked in the car for 20 minutes before dad lost control. I just wanted to scare them. But the gun went off and he could finish. Where's Amy? I grabbed his shoulders. She ran after the shots. She just ran. I tried to follow, but she disappeared. He was sobbing now. My Phone buzzed again. Another text from Amy. This time a video. She was still tied to the chair, but now someone else was in frame. A man I didn't recognize, wearing a mask. He held up a sign that made everything clear. You took something from me. Now I'm taking something from you. Full story on channel linked below.

I've known Joel for five years now, and we've always been total opposites. He's the confident, athletic type who turns heads when he walks into a room. Me, I'm the chubby, quiet guy who's been losing his hair since 23. We're friends, but we exist in completely different worlds when it comes to dating. So when Joel asked me to be his wingman on a double date, I was surprised. He'd finally gotten somewhere with Jean, this girl he'd been chasing for weeks. Catch. Jean wanted to bring her friend Sam along. Sam was apparently new to dating and nervous, so Jean thought a double date would feel safer. Joel made it very clear what my role was. Keep Sam entertained so he could focus on Jean. Simple enough. I agreed because I had nothing better to do on a Saturday night. Now, here's the thing about Sam. We'd crossed paths a few times at university before this. Every single time, she seemed completely unimpressed by me. And I don't blame her. Those encounters happened when I was wearing the same three rotation outfits. Old band shirts, stretched out hoodies, and jeans that had seen better days. I looked exactly like what I was. A guy who'd given up on trying. But this time, I figured I should at least make an effort. Not for any romantic reason, just basic respect. If someone's giving up their Saturday Evening to sit across from me. The least I could do is not look like I just rolled out of bed. So yesterday I went to an actual barber. I had them cut my hair as short as possible without fully shaving it. Trying to own the balding rather than hide it. I cleaned up my beard and shaped it properly. Then I hit the mall and bought clothes that actually fit. A white button up, a flannel to layer over it, and dark jeans. Nothing expensive, just presentable. The day of the date, I kept second guessing everything. Was the flannel too much? Eventually, I grabbed a single rose from the grocery store on the way. Corny, maybe, but I thought it might break the ice. I ended up running five minutes late. My phone was exploding with texts from Joel. When I finally walked up, holding that rose, the energy shifted completely. Joel's face fell immediately. Jean's eyebrow shot up in surprise, but Sam, her

No explanation, no discussion. Just out. I didn't respond immediately. I couldn't. I just sat there in my apartment, the one I delayed buying for years because of them. Feeling like I've been punched in the chest. Three weeks later, I found out why. I was scrolling Facebook and saw a post in a local business group. Mom and Colin beaming, shaking hands with some guy I'd never seen. The caption announced a major new partnership that will propel the business into a new era of growth. They'd signed a massive deal, one that would completely restructure the company I owned 40% of. And I found out on social media. I called mom. She was dismissive. Oh, that. Yes. We meant to tell you. It all happened so fast, dear. Fast affects my percentage. Why wasn't I consulted? Alex, Sweetie, we didn't think you needed to be involved. You're not here every day. It's complicated business stuff. We handled it. Then Colin got on the line. Yeah, a man. You're just the money guy. Let us handle the real decisions. You wouldn't get it anyway. Just the money guy. 12 years of sacrifice reduced to five condescending words. That's when the hurt twisted into something colder, clearer. I stopped hoping they'd see me differently and started seeing them for what they really were. So I went quiet. They probably expected me to argue, to beg for my place back. Instead, I made some calls. Turns out my 40% Was the Lynch pin of their entire deal. The new partner needed majority ownership, stability. Mom and Colin had promised it, using my share as leverage. Planning to buy me out at an insulting low ball price through their lawyer. Without my 40%, the whole thing collapsed. I sold to their biggest competitor instead for triple what mom's lawyer was offering. The sale went through on a Tuesday. By Thursday morning, my phone was exploding. Colin's first text. Call me now. His fifth. What did you do? His 20th. The deal fell through. Do you understand what you've done? His 40th. Mom's crying. Dad won't come out of his office. His 65th. Please, we can fix this. Just call me back. His 72nd at 3 a m. Please, Alex. Dad's in the hospital. The stress. His heart. Please, just answer. I read every single one. Felt nothing but a strange, cold satisfaction. Then I typed four words and hit send. Understood. Good luck. And I blocked them all.

Your arms must be tired, she said softly. Then Jess canceled their reservation on her phone. I'd rather hang out with you. Caitlin appeared at the top of the stairs in a dress that cost more than our monthly groceries, but her face changed when she saw her friends clustered around me. Why aren't you ready to go? Her voice pitched higher. Valerie didn't even look up from ashy. Did you know your husband makes homemade baby food? He does all the night feedings. Caitlin started down quickly. That doesn't matter. We need to leave. We have questions, Jess interrupted, finally, looking at Caitlin with an expression I'd never seen before. Caitlin reached the bottom of the stairs with her face flushed. What questions? Madison turned to her. Why aren't you helping your husband with ashy? The color drained from Caitlin's face. I am helping. I manage our calendar. When did you last change a diaper? Valerie asked quietly. Caitlin's mouth opened and closed. He's just better at it. He's home more. You work from home twice a week? I said quietly, my first words since they'd arrived. And you're usually back by noon the other days? Jess stood slowly. He's exhausted, Caitlin. Taking care of a baby alone while you post martini pics. Caitlin's hands clenched. You don't understand our arrangement. What arrangement? Madison asked, the one where he does everything while you pretend you're single online. Then she touched my shoulder gently and said something that made me shutter. If you were mine, I'd help you all day. I swear I saw Caitlin's face go purple from the corner of my eye. Madison, what the hell did you just say? I only told the truth, replied Madison. What followed was a back and forth between Caitlin saying, he's mine, and Madison replying with, not for long. I watched them in shock, wondering if I should defend Caitlin, when Valerie approached me and slipped a paper into my apron pocket. My brother is a divorce lawyer, just in case you might want to consider that. I reached for the paper, remembering all those times when Caitlin had blown off my calls about ashy being sick, and said, maybe I will. Thanks.

Clean the kitchen before my friends get here, she ordered, already scrolling through her phone. And hide Ashy's toys. The house looks like a daycare. I shifted ashy to my other hip, her sticky hands grabbing at my shirt. Caitlin hadn't held our daughter once this week. Been too busy posting selfies from boutiques and wine bars to notice Ashy's first word.

Twenty minutes later, the doorbell rang. I opened the door and greeted Caitlin's friends, Jess, Madison, and Valerie. Oh my god! Jess gasped. Look at you being super dad! Madison immediately reached for ashey. She's adorable. And were you cooking while holding a baby? This is literally the most attractive thing ever. They followed me inside, completely ignoring their original mission to collect Caitlin. What are you making? Valerie asked, genuinely interested. It smells amazing. I've been making homemade baby food. Something Caitlin called extra and unnecessary, but her friends were fascinated, cooing over ashey and actually listening when I explained her schedule. Felt super awkward, mainly because I wasn't used to this much attention. You memorize her nap times? Really? Madison said, impressed. My boyfriend doesn't even know what day garbage goes out. Jess sat on our couch. King Ashy giggle. You're amazing with her, she said. Meanwhile, Madison studied me carefully. The exhaustion, the baby food stains, the practiced way I grabbed Ashy's bottle one handed. Wait. Do you do this every day? Alone? The question hung in the air. Valerie pulled out her phone. Caitlin posted yesterday from that new wine bar at two PM. Who was watching ashy? My silence was enough of an answer. She doesn't help at all, does she? Jess whispered. The way they looked at me, shocked, but also something else. Something appreciative. Told me they were seeing their friend's marriage differently than Caitlin had been portraying it on social media.

My brother Jake was getting married to this girl who seemed super sweet. At first she was all smiles and hugs whenever I was around, but when it came time to pick bridesmaid dresses, her true colors started showing. She wanted everyone to wear this specific coral pink dress that cost $800 not including alterations. I'm a college student working part time at a coffee shop, making barely enough to cover my rent and ramen noodles. Eight hundred dollars might as well have been 8,000. I politely told her I couldn't afford it and asked if there was maybe a cheaper option or if I could get something similar in the same color. She literally laughed at me and said if I couldn't afford to be in her wedding, maybe I shouldn't be in it at all. But then she quickly backtracked when she realized how that sounded and suggested I could just borrow money from my parents. Here's the thing. My parents died in a car accident when I was 17. Jake knew this. His fiance knew this. I've been on my own since then, working my way through school with student loans and whatever jobs I could find. I explained my situation again, thinking maybe she forgot. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic and that everyone has to make sacrifices for weddings. Then she suggested I could sell some of my stuff or Pick up extra shifts to make it happen. I was already working 30 hours a week on top of full time classes. I had nothing left to sell except my laptop, which I needed for school, and my car, which I needed to get to work. The whole thing made me feel like absolute garbage. Jake wasn't much better when I went to him for help. He said his fiance was just stressed about wedding planning and that I should try to understand. He offered to lend me the money, but I'd have to pay him back within six months with interest because they were saving for a house. Interest from my own brother for a dress I'd wear once to watch him marry someone who clearly thought I was beneath her. That's when I realised this wasn't really about the money. It was about respect. She could have easily picked a less expensive dress or worked with everyone's budgets. Instead, she chose to make it a test of who really wanted to be there for her special day. I told Jake I couldn't make it work and wouldn't be in the wedding party. He got angry and said I was being selfish and trying to ruin his big day. His fiance jumped in and said she wasn't surprised because I'd always been jealous of their relationship and was probably looking for an excuse to cause drama. The whole thing blew up. Jake said if I couldn't support him as A bridesmaid? Then maybe I shouldn't come at all. I said fine and didn't go to the wedding. I spent that Saturday working a double shift at the coffee shop, making the money I would have blown on a dress I'd never wear again.

We need to keep this family together. I just stare. At him. Then I started laughing. Not a happy laugh. The kind of laugh you do when something is so ridiculous you can't believe it's real. No, I said. I'm not paying back anything. My dad's face turned red. Excuse me? I got accepted to three universities last month. All of them offered me full academic scholarships. I never needed your money anyway. The room went completely silent. My mom whispered, you applied to colleges? Yeah. You never asked. I walked upstairs, packed a bag and called my aunt. She picked me up at night, and I've been living with her ever since. My parents have called me 67 times. I haven't answered once.

I've arranged tasks that must be completed before the full estate terms are implemented. Amanda, the envelope contains the key to my lakehouse. Go there immediately. And remember, things aren't always as they appear. Sometimes a single dollar is worth more than millions. Mom's mask cracked. Amanda will naturally accompany. No, I interrupted. Grandpa said I go alone. At the lakehouse, I found his study unlocked. Inside, a notebook detailing his true holdings. Over $24 million. A letter to me to investigate Riley Innovations. Within hours, I uncovered everything. In the 1990s, Grandpa had founded a tech company with revolutionary patents. My father, handling legal work, advised him a competing patent would make it worthless. He recommended immediate sale. Grandpa sold for a fraction of its value. Six months later, the buyer made billions using his designs. No competing patent ever emerged. The most damning detail. Mom worked in acquisitions at the buying company. They orchestrated the theft together, pocketing nearly half a million in hidden fees. Grandpa discovered the truth five years ago. That's when he restructured everything. When I confronted my parents at the lake house with the documents, dad turned pale. Mom recovered quickly. That was ancient history. Business is Complicated, then a courier arrived with Grandpa's final letter. The will reading was a

My dad added that since my sister would be taking over his company someday, she needed to get a customs to the lifestyle. They genuinely believed she was their golden ticket to the future. But here's the thing. My sister was failing almost every class. Our school sent letters home constantly about her grades, but my parents never checked. They just believed whatever she told them. Meanwhile, I was going straight A's because I felt guilty that they were spending $60,000 a year on private school for both of us. I studied every night while my sister went out with her rich friends. Last month, everything blew up. My parents announced they were leaving town for a week for some business. This conference. They left us $150 for food and emergencies. That was it. The day after they left, my sister came home furious. Apparently, one of her friends had been showing off her designer watch collection at lunch. And my sister couldn't stand that someone had something she didn't. She spent the next two days asking all her friends about watches and researching brands online. Then She came into my room and said, I know where dad keeps his credit cards. Should I borrow one? I looked at her like she was insane. Are you serious? No. Absolutely not. If you want something that expensive, call dad and ask him. She rolled her eyes. What's the worst that can happen? I'll just say it was an emergency. I shook my head. Do whatever you want, but keep me completely out of it. I'm not covering for you this time. She left my room, and 10 minutes later, I heard her scream from downstairs. I got it. My stomach dropped.

So I'm now refusing to pay her private school tuition. My twin sister was born three minutes after me, but you'd think she arrived on a golden chariot. Our parents were told during delivery that the second baby might not survive. The doctor said the chances were slim. So when my sister made it, my parents literally called her the Chosen One and treated her like a miracle. Ever since. Growing up, we shared everything. Birthdays, a room, even friends. But the differences were impossible to ignore. On our 16th birthday, my parents threw this massive party in our backyard. Everyone was there. Family, neighbors, kids from school. When it was time for presents, my dad walked my sister outside with his hands over her eyes, sitting in the driveway with a brand new white BMW with a giant red bow on top. Everyone started cheering and taking photos. My sister was screaming and crying happy tears. I stood there holding a gift bag with three shirts from target. I tried to stay positive. I walked up to my mom and quietly asked if the car there was a gift for both of us to share. The entire party went silent. Everyone turned to stare at my mom, waiting for her answer. She looked around nervously, then said really loud, yes, of course, sweetie. It's for both of you. My sister heard that and completely Lost it. She started screaming, no, it's not! And slamming the car door over and over. My dad rushed over and pulled her aside. I watched him whisper something in her ear, and instantly she calmed down.

My parents laughed while handing my sister $6.9 million. Me? They gave me $1 and said, go earn your own. My mother smirked. Some kids just don't measure up. But when the lawyer read Grandpa's final letter, my mom started screaming. I never expected to watch my sister Caroline receive everything while I got humiliated with a single dollar. My grandfather Maxwell had been my hero, my only ally in a family that treated me like a disappointment. Caroline was the Golden Child. Business school, perfect posture, country club connections. I chose environmental science. That won't pay for the lifestyle you're accustomed to, mom would say with disgust. Grandpa was different. We fish at his lake house, while my family located in Europe. The world needs people who care about its future more than its stock market, he'd tell me. When he got cancer two years ago, my parents suddenly became attentive. Expensive gifts, frequent visits. Their concern matched his net worth exactly. I just brought homemade soup and sat with him. During one of our last visits, he squeezed my hand. Remember, timing is everything. The truth always rises to the surface. At the funeral, mom networked with his former colleagues. Caroline's makeup stayed flawless through precisely two tears. I stood alone by the photo display I'd arranged. The will reading was worse than I imagined. Mom got the Beacon Hill mansion. Caroline got six point nine million dollars in a trust.

They can take her office. I'm giving her computer stuff to Evan. She spends too much time on it anyway. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. He was planning to give away my two thousand dollar setup that I'd worked years to afford without even asking me. I grabbed his iPad the next morning after he left for work. It was unlocked and there was a family group chat open. My hands were shaking as I read through the messages. Matt had been planning this for weeks. Parents were selling their house. They'd be moving in at the end of the month. His mom even made a joke about selling my desk set up since she won't be needing an office anyway, she travels for work so much. They were laughing about it, making plans to convert my space into a bedroom. Matt said I'd get over it eventually and that I was too focused on work anyway. I felt sick. This was my home too. And he was planning to completely dismantle my life without even having the decency to discuss. Sit with me. So today I told my manager I wasn't feeling well and left work at noon. I drove home with my heart hounding. I unlocked a door as quietly as possible. And then I heard it. Voices in my office. Male voices. I walked down the hall and pushed open the door. There was Matt, his dad and his brother. Evan. My monitors were already disconnected. My desk was halfway disassembled. Everything was being loaded into boxes labeled storage. And, Evan, they all froze when they saw me. Matt's face went white. His dad had the audacity to smile and say, oh, hey, we wanted to surprise you. We're helping Matt's parents move in. Isn't that exciting? I looked at Matt, just stared at him. And then I said the only thing I could think of. Get out of my house.

He immediately found the receipt, and his face went red. He started yelling about how irresponsible I was being with money, how we could have used that for something practical, how I was being selfish. I just stared at him. Then I said, Matt, I make $180,000 a year here. Now this is 1% of my salary. His mouth dropped open. He had no idea. I guess I forgot to mention the exact number when I told him about the job. From that moment on, he gave me complete silence. Wouldn't talk to me at breakfast, wouldn't respond to my texts, would leave the room when I walked in. It was like living with a ghost. But then things got weirder. My stuff started disappearing. First, it was my favorite hoodie from college. I asked Matt about it, and he said he donated it because it was old and ratty. I was annoyed, but didn't think much of it. Then my running shoes vanished. He said he gave them to his brother. They were $150 shoes I'd bought two months ago. Next was my expensive noise cancelling headphones. I use them for work calls. When I asked where they were, Matt casually said his dad needed headphones, so he gave them to him. I told him he couldn't just take my stuff without asking. He shrugged and said, you make enough money to replace them. I was furious, but Didn't want to fight. I just bought new ones. One night last week, I woke up around 2:00am. Matt wasn't in bed. I could hear him talking on the phone in the living room. I stayed quiet and listened. He was talking to his sister, and what I heard made my blood run cold. Yeah? I'm moving mom and dad in next month. He said she doesn't know yet, but she'll deal with it. We've got three rooms. One is mine, one is hers.

Then her piggy bank was suddenly empty. I went to grab some quarters from my daughter's piggy bank for parking and found nothing but three pennies rolling around inside. Layla was only seven and had been saving up for months to buy a new bike with all her birthday and tooth fairy money. The piggy bank felt way too light when I picked it up, and those three pennies made this sad little noise when I shook it. When Layla got home from school, I sat her down at the kitchen table with her favourite snack. Sweetie, where did all your piggy bank money go? She kept her eyes on her shoes and mumbled something I couldn't hear. What was that, honey? I asked gently. I gave it all to Aubrey, she finally said louder. She never has lunch money, and yesterday the lunch lady didn't let her eat. My heart swelled with pride, but I was also confused. Why didn't this kid have lunch money? The next morning, I gave Layla five extra dollars. Give this to Aubrey for lunch today, okay? She jumped up and threw her arms around me. Thanks, Mommy. You're the best, she said, before running to catch the bus. I couldn't stop thinking about why some kid didn't have lunch money every single day. Because as even when money was tight, we always figured it out. Around lunchtime, my phone rang. This is Principal Rouse, could you come in for a meeting about Layla? Twenty minutes later, I was sitting in the principal's office. Your daughter has been giving money to another student, which is technically against school policy, but we need to talk about the whole situation here. I braced myself. Aubrey's family has been going through a lot. We can't share all the details, but your daughter has been making sure that child eats lunch every day. She paused and looked at me carefully. The family applied for free lunch, but there's a waiting period and tons of paperwork. Meanwhile, we have a seven year old going hungry. I felt my throat get tight. So Layla can keep helping her, right? The principal smiled for the first time. Of course. And we appreciate your kindness. Actually, Aubrey's mother has been asking about you. She wants to pay you back, but she's too embarrassed to reach

Il avait trop peur de sortir. J'ai vu l'appel trop tard, pendant la pause d√©jeuner. Ma m√®re ne r√©pondait pas, elle √©tait au travail, alors je l'ai appel√© et je lui ai dit de sortir par l'arri√®re, de prendre une autre rue. Ce jour-l√†, il est rentr√© sain et sauf. Le soir, maman a dit qu'on devait contacter le coll√®ge pour signaler le harc√®lement, mais quand elle a appel√© le lendemain, la secr√©taire a dit que le premier rendez-vous possible avec le principal √©tait dans trois semaines. Trois semaines. Pendant ce temps, malik continuait. Il postait des trucs sur les r√©seaux en disant qu'il allait le choper un de ses jours. Les messages √©taient √©clairs, violents. M√™me. Sami a tout montr√© au coll√®ge. Ils ont r√©pondu que ce qui se passe en ligne ne rel√®ve pas de l'√©cole. Je bouillais. Je voulais le prot√©ger, mais je ne pouvais pas toujours √™tre l√†. Nos horaires ne coincid√®rent pas. Et puis, un jour de d√©cembre, j'√©tais en cours de maths. Sami m'a appel√©, paniqu√©. Il pleurait, parlait vite. Je comprenais √† moiti√©. Malik et ses potes l'avaient coinc√© dans les vestiaires et menac√© de le frapper √† la sortie. Il lui avait pris son t√©l√©phone. Pour pas qu'il appelle √† l'aide, il avait emprunt√© le portable d'un autre √âl√®ve. Pour me joindre, il s'√©tait r√©fugi√© √† l'infirmerie. L'infirmi√®re savait que quelque chose n'allait pas, mais elle ne pouvait rien faire. Ma m√®re √©tait encore au boulot, il √©tait treize heures trente et son coll√®ge finissait √† quatorze heures quarante-cinq. J'avais √† peine une heure pour trouver une solution. Alors j'ai lev√© la main et j'ai dit √† mon prof que j'avais une urgence familiale. Il m'a demand√© quel genre d'urgence. J'ai expliqu√© que mon petit fr√®re √©tait en danger et que je devais aller le chercher. Il m'a regard√© en silence. Et c'est l√† que tout a bascul√©. Le reste de l'histoire est sur ma.

Juste parce que j'ai quitt√© le lyc√©e pour aller chercher mon petit fr√®re. La r√®gle du lyc√©e disait clairement que toute absence non autoris√©e entra√Ænait une sanction imm√©diate, et plus de trois absences injustifi√©es dans le semestre signifiaient exclusion, peu importe tes notes ou la raison. J'avais dix-sept ans, d√©j√†, accept√© dans trois universit√©s quand tout s'est √©croul√©. Saint ren√©, c'√©tait un lyc√©e priv√© r√©put√©, qui prenait les meilleurs √©l√®ves des quartiers d√©favoris√©s. Il prometteur d'une chance d'aller dans les grandes √©coles, √† condition d'ob√©ir √† toutes les r√®gles, sans discuter. Au d√©but, √ßa semblait un bon deal. J'arrivais d'un coll√®ge o√π il y avait des d√©tecteurs de m√©taux √† l'entr√©e et des flics dans les couloirs. L√†, les classes √©taient petites, les profs exigeants, et presque tous les √©l√®ves partaient ensuite √† la fac. Ce qu'ils ne disaient pas, c'est √† quel point ils √©taient stricts. Tu faisais un pas de travers et t'√©tais dehors. Mon petit fr√®re, samy, avait treize ans. Il allait au coll√®ge public, √† quelques rues de chez nous. Il voulait aussi aller √† saint-ren√©, mais ma m√®re, qui bossait de nuit √† l'h√¥pital, n'avait pas le temps de s'occuper des papiers. Samy √©tait brillant, dr√¥le, un peu na√Øf aussi. Ce qui, √©videmment, tirer les mauvaises personnes. Tout a commenc√© en octobre. Il avait renvers√© du jus sur les chaussures d'un gars dans la cantine. Rien de grave, mais ce type, malik, l'a pris comme une insulte. Depuis ce jour, il s'est mis √† le harceler. Il lui lan√ßait des menaces, le poussait dans les couloirs, disait qu'il allait l'attendre apr√®s les cours. Samy en a parl√© √† ses profs, mais il disait qu'il ne pouvait.

She took the rose and laughed, saying she couldn't remember the last time someone had given her flowers. Joel pulled me aside and whispered, dude, what are you doing? I didn't understand the question. I was just being a decent date. Dinner started with Joel trying to dominate the conversation, but Sam kept asking me questions, genuinely interested. She found out I was into classic movies, and suddenly we were deep in conversation while Joel and Jean faded into the background. After dinner, Sam suggested bowling the alley. Sam and I destroyed Joel and Jean. We were laughing, high fiving, and she kept playfully trash talking me every time I got a gutterball. Then Sam wanted ice cream, so we walked to her favorite local shop. She ordered this weird combination of flavors, and I tried it. Even though it sounded terrible, it was actually amazing. We sat on a bench outside just talking while Joel and Jean wandered around nearby. I wasn't trying to steal anyone's spotlight. I was literally just talking to Sam and laughing at her jokes. Jean seemed perfectly happy watching her friend enjoy herself. When we said our goodbye eyes, Sam hugged me and whispered, thank you for actually trying tonight. She asked if I wanted to hang out again sometime, just us. I said yes before I could overthink it. The second Sam and Jean left, Joel absolutely unloaded on me in the parking lot. He said, Bringing a rose was cringe and that I'd embarrassed him, that I dressed way too formally. I looked down at my flannel and jeans completely confused. Then he said the quiet part out loud. You were supposed to entertain Sam so Jean would focus on me, not actually impress her. You made me look bad. I just stared at him. Made him look bad. I barely spoke to Jean the entire night. She had every opportunity to give him attention, but she chose to watch her friend be happy instead. Joel said if I was going to act like that, I should have just stayed home. I got in my car and left without responding. Now he's sending me paragraph long texts about how I violated bro code and ruined his chances with Jean, all because I got a haircut and bought a rose.

I've known Joel for five years now, and we've always been total opposites. He's the confident, athletic type who turns heads when he walks into a room. Me, I'm the chubby, quiet guy who's been losing his hair since 23. We're friends, but we exist in completely different worlds when it comes to dating. So when Joel asked me to be his wingman on a double date, I was surprised. He'd finally gotten somewhere with Jean, this girl he'd been chasing for weeks. Catch gene wanted to bring her friend Sam along. Sam was apparently new to dating and nervous, so gene thought a double date would feel safer. Joel made it very clear what my role was. Keep Sam entertained so he could focus on Jean. Simple enough. I agreed because I had nothing better to do on a Saturday night. Now, here's the thing about Sam. We'd crossed paths a few times at university before this. Every single time, she seemed completely unimpressed by me. And I don't blame her. Those encounters happened when I was wearing the same three rotation outfits. Old band shirts, stretched out hoodies, and jeans that had seen better days. I looked exactly like what I was. A guy who'd given up on trying. But this time, I figured I should at least make an effort. Not for any romantic reason, just basic respect. If someone's giving up their Saturday Evening to sit across from me, the least I could do is not look like I just rolled out of bed. So yesterday I went to an actual barber. I had them cut my hair as short as possible without fully shaving it. Trying to own the ball holding rather than hide it. I cleaned up my beard and shaped it properly. Then I hit the mall and bought clothes that actually fit. A white button up, a flannel to layer over it, and dark jeans. Nothing expensive, just presentable. The day of the date, I kept second guessing everything. Was the flannel too much? Eventually, I grabbed a single rose from the grocery store on the way. Corny, maybe, but I thought it might break the ice. I ended up running five minutes late. My phone was loading with text from Joel. When I finally walked up holding that rose, the energy shifted completely. Joel's face fell immediately. Jean's eyebrow shot up in surprise, but Sam, her entire face transformed. Her eyes actually sparkled.

This happened three weeks ago, and I still can't get the feeling of that cold water running down my back out of my mind. We were making dinner together. Just simple canned chili, nothing fancy. She asked me to chop some onions to add to it. I thought it was straightforward enough. I've chopped onions before. I'm not completely useless in the kitchen. I was standing at the counter, carefully cutting them up, trying to make sure they were decent sized. She walked by to check on the chili and suddenly stopped. Her whole mood shifted instantly. What are you doing? Those are way too coarse. They're supposed to be much smaller than that. I looked down at what I've done. They seemed fine to me. But I said, okay, I can fix it. She got more upset. No, you already ruined it. You put them in the pot already. The chili is messed up now. I tried explaining that they were just sitting on top. I could scoop them out easily with a spoon, cut them smaller and put them back in. No big deal. But she just pushed me out of the way and grabbed the knife from my hand. I let go immediately. My self esteem has been pretty much non existent for a while now. So I just back. I started saying that I did exactly what she asked me to do. And if she'd wanted them added at the end as a garnish instead of during cooking, she should have just told me that. I wish I could do something, anything, right for once. I walked to the bedroom feeling pathetic. I'm 28 years old, and apparently I can't even make canned chili correctly. I sat on the bed, trying to stay out of her way so she could fix whatever I'd supposedly destroyed. A few minutes later, she brought dinner in on a tray. I was ready to just drop the whole thing and move on. We both both ate quietly. She only finished about half of her food before taking it back to the kitchen. I apologized again, multiple times, trying to smooth things over. She didn't respond, just stared at me with this look. So I tried to explain my side, that maybe the communication could have been clear about exactly how she wanted those onions prepared and when to add them. That's when she cut me off. You're not listening to me. You keep interrupting. I genuinely didn't understand. I thought we were taking turns talking. I was desperately trying to stay calm.

He actually laughed. I'm taking her to a shelter. This house would be better without that beast. You should be thanking me. Now you won't waste money on dog food. I was seeing Red. Seth, I swear to god, if you don't bring Luna back right now. He cut me off. Or what? Cole won't let you do anything to me. I'm family. That's when something in me snapped. If he wanted to play dirty, I could play dirty, too. Here's what Seth didn't know. Luna had a GPS tracker in her collar, something I'd invested in after hearing about dog thefts in our area. I pulled over and checked the app. They were headed to a shelter across town. I called the police immediately, reporting a stolen dog. Then I called the shelter, warning them about a man trying to surrender a dog that wasn't his. Then I called Cole's work and had them pull him out of his meetings. But I had one more card to play. See, Seth had been bragging to Cole for months about his side hustle, stealing merchandise from his old workplace before, where they fired him. Cole, being the good brother, had actually documented everything, hoping to eventually convince Seth to come clean and return the stuff. I told Cole it was time to use those files. When I got to the shelter, my heart was pounding. Four police cars surrounded Seth. Speed up Honda in the parking lot. Luna was pressed against the window, barking frantically, her eyes wide with panic. The officers pulled Seth out of the car. He was cocky at first, marking, this is my brother's dog. I'm just helping them out. That's when I stepped forward with my phone. Officers, this dog is microchipped and registered to me. I have all the paperwork. But there's something else you should know. This man has been stealing from his former employer. I have documented evidence. Seth's face went from smug to white in seconds. The shelter staff had already pulled up Luna's microchip information. She was registered to me with my contact information, my vet records, everything. They refused to accept her, the police were very interested in those files Cole was sending them. Seth got arrested right there in the parking lot. The stolen merchandise was still in his storage unit. Over $5,000 worth. He lost the new job he just lined up. Once they ran a background check, his probation officer from an old DUI violation got notified, everything collapsed for him in 45 minutes. Cole finally saw his brother for who he really was. The golden child illusion shattered completely. Luna's home safe now, currently sleeping on her favorite spot on the couch. Seth's facing felony theft charges and violated probation. He's looking at serious jail time. And me? I'm never letting anyone hurt my family again. Never.

Her kids need their sleep. They've been so fussy lately. I stared at my mother for a long moment. This woman who raised me, who I called every Sunday, who I'd been there for through everything. Okay, I said quietly, we'll go. Great. Amber called out as I turned away. Come back around four. Maybe four, 4:30. We should be done eating by then. We walked back to the car. My husband Greg was gripping the steering wheel so hard, his knuckles were white. He heard everything through the open windows. We're leaving, I told him. He didn't argue, just started the car. The kids cried for the first Stour. My daughter kept asking why grandma didn't want to see them. My son asked if they'd done something wrong. I had no answers that wouldn't break their little hearts. Greg was silent, but I could see the anger radiating off him. We got home around 5 p m. I ordered pizza, put on a movie, tuck them in early, both of them still sniffling. Then I went to my office and opened my laptop. I wrote two emails. One to mom, one to Amber. Subject line. Family expectations. I didn't yell, I didn't curse. I just listed facts. Every Christmas where Amber's kids opened presents first while mine waited. Every birthday party where we were asked to come late or leave early so Amber's kids wouldn't be overwhelmed. Every family photo where we were positioned in The back or dropped out entirely. Every single time, they chose her over us. I ended with one sentence. Don't contact me unless you're ready to apologize to my children's faces. I hit send at 11:17 p m. My phone started buzzing at 11:19. Amber 1st. Are you serious right now? You're acting insane, mom. Two minutes later. This is very hurtful. We were just trying to keep the peace. My aunt at 11:32. Your mother is crying. What did you say to her? I forwarded every single defensive, angry message to our family group chat. Every excuse, every dismissal, every time they called me dramatic or sensitive. Then I posted one message. This is why we won't be attending family events anymore. Screenshot saved for when my kids are old enough to ask why. And I left the group. By morning, I had 67 messages across text, voicemail, and social media. Mom's final voicemail was what did it. You're being incredibly dramatic. We just needed some buy it. Amber's children are more delicate than yours. You should understand that. I saved that voicemail. One day, my kids will ask why we stopped seeing grandma, and I'll let them listen to her explain how they weren't worthy inconvenience.

I know, honey, but Amber's been having such a difficult time. The kids were up all night. She really needs them to sleep.

When I was 13, my family moved from Texas to this tiny town in Ontario, Canada. I was super nervous about starting over at a new school, so I came up with what I thought was the most genius plan ever. On my first day, I walked into homeroom and introduced myself with the thickest, most ridiculous fake British accent you've ever heard. I told everyone I was from Birmingham, England, even though I had never even been on a plane before that moved to Canada. The accent was absolutely terrible, like a mix of Harry Potter and some random YouTube videos I'd watched the night before, but somehow it actually worked. At first all the kids thought I was so cool and worldly. They kept asking me to say random words just to hear my accent. I got invited to birthday parties, added to group chats, and even asked to sleepovers. Teachers loved having me share my global perspective in class. I had never gotten this much attention before in my entire life, and honestly, it was addictive. But keeping up the lie was exhausting. I had to remember to use the accent everywhere. In the hallways, talking to teachers, even when neighbors saw me outside. I would literally pretend to talk to my nan on the phone just to practice in public. Every night I'd stay up googling British slang and watching videos trying to Sound more natural. Then things got really bad. Halfway through the year, this new girl named Ella joined our class. She was sweet, funny, and had the most beautiful, natural British accent I'd ever heard. She was actually from Manchester. My heart.

I'm over stimulated. The kids are not happy about their individual things that they are not happy about, whether it makes sense or not.

He pokes his head out from the bathroom down the hall, where he's brushing the teeth of our two younger boys, and he looks at her dead serious, and he goes, she's right. It's true.

Well, I did. Haven't missed any payments. Who took it? He sends me to the very convenient ear specialist around the corner, who then looks in my ear and goes, Jesus, that is not the first thing I want my doctor to say to me. You think you know where this is going and you think it's gonna be a bug? Wrong. This man informs me that there is a small tooth sized bone growing across my ear. So I'm sitting there trying to process this like, so should I go to the dentist? And he goes, oh no. It's only covering about 60% of your ear canal, so as long as it doesn't start growing more, then you don't need immediate surgery.

Which pencil would you rather be? This one. And what do we like about this pencil? That's right. It hasn't been used. You probably see these a lot cause you're 12. Now, what about this pencil? It's been used a lot. And probably by sharpeners that didn't even care about it. Every time you let a woman have sex with you, even if she says she loves you. You are giving pieces of yourself away that you can never get back. And you will be nothing for your wife. That goes for sharpening your own pencil too, okay? People will say that it's natural and it's healthy. But it's gross and it's wrong. And you should be deeply ashamed of yourself. Next week we're gonna talk about how God's divine plan for your body is pants. You don't wanna have your knees out and have all the girls think less of you. I don't care how hot it is.

And they're like, oh, you know, keep a PG thirteen. And I volunteered to say the first joke, and I said, it's PG thirteen, but it's about the human body. Like, oh, we're all adults, we can handle them. Like, okay, perfect. So all of the parts of the body got together to decide who should be in charge. The brain, being the brain was like, listen, I'm in control of all of you. I should be in charge. The feet chime, and they're like, no, we should be in charge because we do all the heavy. We literally carry all of you. So we, you are in charge. The asshole chimes in, and he's like, listen, without me, you can't get rid of none of the shit that we don't need no more. And the brains like, hold up, guys, hold up. Feet, you can't move unless I say you move. You wouldn't even know how to put one foot in front of the other. And asshole, all you do is open and close. You don't even know how this shit gets made. You have nothing to say here. The feet agreed. The asshole took it personally, though, and he decided to go on strike and stop working for 3 days. That asshole did not open And you know what happened? That whole body got filled with shit. So they had to have an emergency meeting. And they all got together and they're like, brain, brain, please let this asshole be in charge. Like, we're all gonna die unless this asshole's in charge. And the brains like, okay, asshole, you can be in charge. Moral of the story is, sometimes there's an asshole in charge. It's not necessarily because he's the smartest one of the group. No, he's just an asshole. And sometimes assholes are in places of power. Thinking about it, maybe saying that to all the supervisors wasn't the best course of action, you know? But it is just a joke, you know? It's kind of funny. I don't know why people are so fucking sensitive nowadays. Maybe you're an asshole.

I just have to ask a few standard questions before we proceed forward. Yeah, that's fine. Is it your anniversary? No. Do you know her birthday? No. I forget it every year. But I know that there's no snow on the ground when it's her birthday and there's snow on the ground. Now, that is fantastic, sir, and you're doing great. I just. I want you to know that. Thank you. No worries, sir. We're all about helping our brothers here at the hotline. Now, I do need you to read me the last text she sent you. She texted me if I wanted bone in or bone out. Dry ribs. She said she prefers bone in everything. And then gave that weird little side eyed face, kind of like a wink, but like, more seductive. That's a very seductive text, sir. Congratulations on what I assume was a very intimate evening. Intimate evening? I just watched basketball and ate boneless dry ribs. Oh, dude, no. What did I miss? Bone in, Dude. Bone in.

And you know what? I'd be damned if, you know, a bitch like me and you get touched. So I told her, baby, don't even worry about it. Go to the bathroom and tell him Brian's on his way, because he knows that I'm the right bitch to fuck with. So I'm on my way to figure out what's happening, okay? Because obviously, something happened in his fucking brain this morning. Maybe he didn't eat his breakfast. Maybe he just woke up and fell down the fucking stairs. I don't know what it is, but he's feeling real stupid right now. So I'm on my way. We're gonna talk it out. I brought this Taser and my other one. We can either talk or we can zap. So that's it.

You will die of high blood pressure and the scar will never be found. I will then take your body two hours away from where I live so that I am outside the standard geographical area. Once we're out in the middle of nowhere, I will dig a 12 foot hole. I will put your body in that hole, bury it halfway, stick a dead animal carcass directly on top and fill up the hole. If the police figure out that that's where I brought your body, the dogs will come sniffing and just find an animal carcass and the police will assume that that's all there was. If they find your body. Insulin doesn't even appear on a standard toxicology report. If they test specifically for insulin, they'll find it in your system and assume you had undiagnosed diabetes.

My husband is the man of the house. My husband makes the final decision. Yes. He allows me to do what I need to do, what I want to do. But if he decides that I don't need to do something, I don't do that. And not because he controls me or I'm weak or whatever. No, it's about. I trust him. I, I trust that he has the power to make the right decision. And that's why I married him. If I didn't think that he could lead me the right way, he wouldn't be my husband. So I know there's a lot of independent women out there that don't need a man or whatever, but if you got a man, let him be a man. Because if you don't, don't complain when he's not leading and he's not providing and he's not being the man that you won't allow him to be. Hear me? My husband is the head of the household.

Here we go. Number one, they should not allow topless sunbathing on the beach. It was very distracting for my husband, who just wanted to relax. On my holiday to India, I was disgusted to find that almost every restaurant served curry. I don't like spicy food. We went on holiday to Spain and had a problem with the taxi drivers as they were all Spanish. We booked an excursion to a water park, but no one told us we had to bring our own swimsuits and towels. We assumed it would be included in the price. The beach was too sandy. We had to clean everything. When we returned to our room, well, we found the sand was not like the sand in the brochure. Your sand show. The sand is white, but it was more yellow. It's lazy for the shopkeepers to close in the afternoon. I often needed to buy things during siesta time. This should be banned. No one told us there would be fish in the water. The children were scared. Although the brochure said there was a fully equipped kitchen, there was no egg slicer in the drawers. I think it should be explained in the brochure that the local convenience stores does not sell proper biscuits like custard creams and ginger nuts. The roads were uneven and bumpy, so we could not read the local guidebook during the bus. Ride to the resort. Because of this, we were unaware of many things that would have made our holiday more fun. It took us nine hours to fly home from Jamaica to England. It took the Americans only three hours to get home. This seems unfair. I compared the size of our one bedroom suite to our friends three bedroom and ours was significantly smaller. The brochure stated no hairdressers at the resort. We're trainee hairdressers. And we think they knew and made us wait longer for service. I don't even want to act out the next one, but I'm gonna read it. When we were in Spain, there were too many Spanish people there. The receptionist spoke Spanish, the food was Spanish. No one told us that there would be so many foreigners. Really? We had to line up outside to catch the boat. And there was no air conditioning. Come on! It is your duty as a tour operator to advise us on noisy and unruly guests before we travel. I was bitten by a mosquito. The brochure did not mention mosquitoes. Come on, people, really? Get ready for the last one, cause this one. My fiance and I requested twin beds when we booked, but instead we were placed in a room with a king bed. We now hold you responsible and want to be reimbursed for the fact that I became pregnant. This would not have happened if you had put us in the room that We booked. Are you kidding me

I'm sorry, but did you just say that we blame everything on our hormones? And are you talking about the hormones that cause us to bleed for seven days out of every 28 and cause cramps that can rival the pain from a heart attack? Yeah, hormones must really be no big deal, seeing as they can cause a four course meal to drain from my nipple and prepare a perfect storm in my uterus so that I can create a human life. I can assure you that we are not allowed to blame our hormones for anything. Which is why we're still expected to show up at work on time and with a smile, even when we're passing clots that can rival the size of Pluto and ruining multiple pairs of pants with the lining of our own uterus. But do you know who does blame everything on our hormones? Men. You all just love to tell everyone that we're on our period if we dare show any semblance of anger. And you actually ask us if we're pmsing. If we happen to shed a tear, that means you're the ones who have found a way to invalidate the very legitimate feelings of women by crying over hormones. But you're saying that we're the ones with the excuses. And listen, I've heard men try to blame a sexual Assault on the size of a woman's skirt. So I'm not sure why you're trying to compare that to women having a very legitimate hankering for chocolate. And on that note, I'm pretty sure you've also used our hormones as an excuse to keep women out of the military and out of positions of power. All the while blaming your testosterone for why you punch holes in the wall because of your anger and have trouble staying faithful because of your urges. I don't know why you're acting like employers just hand out candy during that time of the month. And our desks are coming equipped with heating pads and some Midol. Listen, if anyone was catering to women's hormones, then period wouldn't be a word we have to whisper, tampons wouldn't be something we have to exchange in secret, and pads wouldn't be something we still have to pay for in public restrooms. Cause we're not exactly living in a hormone tolerant world if y'all get the toilet paper to wipe your asses for free. But we still can't get a piece of cotton to stop the bleeding without some form of payment or an Amex

I bought my house about six years ago and my new neighbor had him. A new neighbor. Me, he didn't like that cause he had the same neighbor since 1964. Just so happens that I like to fix cars. Well, I bought three cars to make one in the period of a weekend. So I bring three cars home Friday. Well come Sunday two of them are gone. Well, he called the county ordinance on me, told me I had 30 days to remove the vehicles from the premises, which I did in three. I said okay, he wants to be a dickhead, I'm gonna call the Kelly on him for building an addition on his house without it being inspected. I'm the nicest person in the world and do anything for you, but don't fuck with me. Long story short, I didn't have to pay no fines cause the cars were gone in 3 days and his addition cost him over 25 hours to fix. Is he already put the drywall up and never had the electrical inspected. But he had to tear all that back out and fix it. I'll spend a ten thousand dollars to prove a hundred dollar port real quick. That's how petty I am.

I have a rule in the store. While we are shopping, if you are walking, you have to have your hands on the cart. My other daughter had two hands on the cart to trick me so that her sister could go get a baby brother. This poor woman was just trying to pick out the right type of toilet paper.

They decided to help Marge feed Maggie. That day, Homer discovered his colleagues were eating new donuts that were bigger and had more filling than the previous ones. Just as he was about to indulge, he found that there were no donuts left in the box. He kicked open the classroom door. Where did you get these donuts from? A guy with a cart. It could be anywhere. 9, 1, 1. What is your emergency? I'm calling to report a missing donut cart. Homer successfully found the donut brand, but the donuts in the vendor's cart were sold out. So Terrence gave Homer a beer barrel shaped donut. Homer drank the beer and then swallowed the donut. He invited Terrence to buy the house next to his and the two families quickly became neighbours. Homer brought his family to visit Terrence's house. Terrence's wife breastfed her child in front of Marge, which made Marge feel very uncomfortable under Terrence's influence. Homer also shaved off all his hair and even tore down the fence in the middle of the yard connecting his yard with Terrence's. Maybe we shouldn't rush things with the new neighbors. You know, we might not all be a perfect match. I have a plan to deal with it. Step one, change everything about ourselves until we are super cool. The end, under the influence of Their new neighbor, Homer, and the children all started acting cool. Homer felt he wasn't cool at all. He never went to college and even bought his CDs at the car wash. So he hoped his children could become super cool so that he could become a cool dad.

I just don't wanna do it anymore, okay? I don't believe you. People give their kidneys to total strangers. You better start talking now. Tell them why we're here. You promised me court. You promised me. You. Both of us refused to back down, neither willing to give in. The judge saw that the evidence wasn't enough, so he announced to delay the trial. But that same night, Kate's condition took a sharp turn for the worse. The doctor pulled my mom aside and whispered that without a kidney transplant, Kate would only have two months left. Watching them talk with heavy faces, my chest tightened. Kate was smart. She figured it out right away. She called the doctor over and asked a few quiet questions. What hurt? I'll make sure that. Even though the truth was clear, mom still couldn't face it. She kept comforting Kate, telling her to wait for the surgery. Kate didn't want her to worry, so she forced a calm smile. Then mom pulled the doctor back outside, begging for a solution. We're doing the operation. What operation? Sarah, you have an unwilling donor. The hospital won't even allow it anymore without a court order. What, you think we don't know what's going on here? Your daughter is dying. I want washed her anxious figure from behind. To Kate, Mom had always been her strongest support. No matter what happened, she Was the one holding our world together. But this time, Kate didn't want to be a burden anymore. She decided to face her fate alone. That night, her hands trembled as she opened her photo album. Inside were the brightest moments of her life. In one picture was a boy, her boyfriend. They met in the chemo room, bonded by the same pain. She once thought her life would be nothing but suffering. But his presence brought warmth back into her heart. Even when chemo made her weak and sick, he never left her side. Mom watched them with mixed feelings. Heartache and relief. She wished they could have a happy ending like any other couple. But fate was cruel. The next morning, the boy lost his battle with illness. Kate was shattered. It was like her soul had been taken away. After that, she no longer feared death. She only hoped that one day she could see him again in another world. Years of dialysis drained her strength, but she still found the courage to tell dad she wanted to see the ocean. After getting the doctor's approval, dad went to pick me up from school. When I saw Kate again, I ran to her and hugged her tight. For a moment, I thought our trip to the sea was finally happening. But when we went home to grab our swimsuits, mom blocked the door. She refused to let us go, afraid the bacteria at the beach would make Kate? Worse. Wait a second. Who is she taking out of the hospital? Ryan! Brian, I said I'll kill her! Give me the keys. I'm taking her back to the hospital. Give me the keys, Brian! Brian, give me. Dad was torn apart, his voice shaking with anger. He said if she didn't let us go, he'd leave her for good. Still, mom didn't give in in the end. Dad's eyes filled with tears as he hit the gas. He drove off with us, leaving everything behind. Ryan, Katie's been. Gotta go back to the hospital.

When all the ice is gone, I still savor the taste, but I have to wait until tomorrow night to taste this treat again. I can't hold it back. I cry. After a long moment, I finally close the fridge door. I find a pack of expired cookies. I carefully scrape off the mold. I spread a little expensive caviar on top. It's barely enough to keep me alive, but it buys me another day. I've been trapped for 72 hours. Three days ago, I broke into a billionaire's mansion to steal a painting. I was ready to leave with my prize, but in my excitement, I entered the wrong code. The alarm system locked every door. The signal to my partner was cut. I panicked. No matter what I tried, the door wouldn't open. I smashed the control panel. The alarm kept screaming. I dragged over a table and cut the wires to the speakers. Finally, the room fell silent, took a breath, but escape was still the priority. Back at the door, I realized it was made of solid Rosewood. I didn't care how expensive it was. I stabbed it with my knife. I didn't notice the control screen flicker to life.

I'm stuck on the day of my classmate's wedding. Even scarier is every time a killer comes after me in a different way. No, no, no, no, no! After dying in countless ways, I've long since come to terms with it. My only pleasure is to seduce every single person at the wedding. What are we doing? The 1 thousand, one hundred and twelfth time, I smoothly bailed out the bride, who forgot her lines. The blessing I rehearsed thousands of times earned a round of applause. This time, I brought the bride's sister, Rita, into the Grove just as I was about to take off my pants. Ah! Ah! Fuck! Even at a moment like this, the killer still comes after me. The killers arrows are like. They have eyes. They turn my butt into a pin cushion. All I can do is run toward the glowing cave ahead. Unexpectedly, Rita followed me out of concern. In an instant, that red light swallowed us both whole. The one third and 30th rebirth. Unlike before, this time Rita sought me out. She, too, had fallen into the loop. I had stumbled into that glowing cave by accident, trapping myself in the cycle. But Rita refuses to sit around and wait to die. She escaped across three states in a single day. But just as she tried to take a break, she was back on the wedding day again. Still, she wouldn't Give up! This time she ran straight into a moving semi truck. No need for the killer. This time, Rita successfully sent me back to bed. Rita's arrival brought new joy to my life. We spiraled upward in a plane. We hit a bomb inside the wedding cake. Everyone stand back! You son of a bitch! You ruined my plan! Just when I thought my boring life had finally turned a new page, the groom showed up shirtless in Rita's room.

My classmates were all mesmerized by my sexy body. The reason I was so confident was because they'd forget everything by the next day. This was my one hundred and eighty fourth rebirth. Every time I woke up, I returned to my birthday. Then I'd be killed in a different way by a masked man. Even if I locked myself in all day, he could still find me with eerie precision. On my 190th rebirth, I finally dodged the attack and got into a car. I slammed the gas pedal and sped onto the street. Catch me now, bitch. Haha. I got pulled over by the cops for speeding, so I tried to hide inside the police station. I'm drunk. I got my wish and sat inside the patrol car. Thank you. I was completely devastated. At least unlock the cuffs before I die. I tried to uncover the masked man's identity, but all I found out was that the campus heartthrob was gay. I gained nothing else. After experiencing 198 different ways to die, I gave up resisting completely. If I had time to run, I might as well enjoy life. I took revenge on lovey dovey couples skydive without any safety gear, beat up the class president who couldn't stand me. On my 200th rebirth, my body had grown extremely weak. I collapsed after a few steps and was taken to the hospital. The doctor told me gravely that I had multiple Internal injuries. My body was on the verge of collapse. It was then I realized that the damage from each death had never healed. I had to kill the masked man and break the cycle to survive. On the 210th, a news report woke me up. A serial killer who targets beautiful women was receiving treatment nearby. It made perfect sense that I'd caught his attention, so I rushed to the hospital. What I saw shocked me. The officer on duty was already unconscious on the floor. A chill ran down my spine. The masked man had appeared behind me just as I feared. He slowly removed his mask. It was the killer from the news. I really was a stunning beauty. Just as I prepared to fight him to the death, my boyfriend suddenly appeared and tackled him. But in the next second, the killer snapped his neck. I didn't even have time to grieve, just ran for my life. I squeezed into the stairwell. Using my body to my advantage, I ambushed him from behind. Just as I was about to finish him off, I suddenly realized that if I broke the cycle, my boyfriend would be dead forever. So I climbed to the top of the stairwell in fury. Looking at the killer's smug face, I swore I'd give him gender reassignment surgery in the next life. On my 211th rebirth for safety, I stole the duty officer's gun and threatened him to call for backup. I Was ready to shoot the killer dead, but he was already waiting in the hospital room. Through the reflection, I spotted him. Without hesitation, I fired and hit him. But just as I was about to breathe a sigh of relief, another masked man grabbed my neck from behind. I was horrified to realize there were two of them. Fine. I go. You go.

I shaved off his bushy beard with a razor. When he fell into endless panic, I drugged him into unconsciousness. I decided to take something of his. Only then did he realise how bad things were. Una vaginoplastia. Hearing that, he finally understood the seriousness of it. He never expected he had done something wrong to my daughter. When he woke from the coma, something of his was already gone. Before he could recover from the shock, I walked into the room with a box. I told him the operation was a success. That was only the beginning. Daily interventions were required to keep things from sticking. He was stunned to see that he could keep his life only by letting me have my way. Three months passed. I told him his body was healing well. He naively thought the punishment was over and asked when he could leave. I said it was only getting started. He begged and apologized, saying he had paid the price. I did not let him go easily. To turn him fully, I started with his skin. I worked day and night in the lab. I developed an artificial skin from animal samples and insect genes. After tests, I grafted the skin onto him. The skin was smooth and resistant to extreme heat and insects. I made him wear a tight shaping suit to change his figure. He pretended to comply, but planned escape. One day, he Asked for help with a stuck zipper. He elbowed me and bolted for the stairs. I had remotely locked the main door. He searched for exits and found none. Despair drove him to harm himself. He expected to escape fate that way. I performed surgery and saved his life. After that, I locked him in a separate room. I slipped dresses into the room to force acceptance. He tore every dress to pieces in rage. I put a television and looped yoga videos. He had nothing else to do but watch. Over time, his heart began to change. He start started doing yoga and calm down. He accepted the makeup I brought in. I hired a caregiver to keep an eye on him. Daily yoga improved his body. Each night I watched him on the monitor. Seeing that new body stirred something in me. I walked into his room without another word.

Oh, shut up. It's been a while, huh? Don't blame me. You're the one who had a heart attack. A doctor did say I need to get more exercise, humorously, comments that the doctor probably meant walks around the block. George Senior teasingly insists that the doctor winked at him and made a little hip rotation. When George Senior asks about weekend plans, Mary suggests starting on the vegetable garden and, of course, attending church on Sunday. George senior proposes a different plan, mentioning going up to Bethy Creek with Georgie to do some fishing. Mary, clearly amused, asks how long George senior had been waiting to spring that idea on her. He replies with a cheeky response about waiting until he was done rotating his hips. Mary laughs, calling him awful. After some playful banter, George senior agrees to talk to Sheldon and figure out something. They share a laugh, and Mary reminisces about taking Sheldon camping, remembering the time Sheldon freaked out over a moth, which leads to a funny moment when Sheldon screams in fear, thinking the butterfly is a threat. George senior tries to calm him down. What I'll just remember when I took him camping. Fly, fly, Sheldon. It's just a butterfly. How is that any better? Butterfly. Butterfly. Ah.

After that, it becomes illegal to remove. She asks if there's anything that can be done about it. The doctor responds that they can only treat it for another month. After that, it becomes illegal to remove the parasite except in a couple of states. He explains that many women learn to embrace the parasite, even naming it and dressing it up in tiny clothes. They even arrange playdates with other parasites. The doctor points out that her lack of periods should have given her an inkling about what was going on. She mentions that she's on a birth control implant, but he tells her that it's also possible for her to not have periods if the implant isn't working. He further explains that she was supposed to be getting regular pregnancy tests. The doctor decides to send a nurse to schedule her prenatal care, telling her that she's due in about five months and that she should start planning. But. Oh, god, like four months ago we had this really big fight. He moved out. I did something stupid. One night stand. Ex boyfriend. I'll schedule you a paternity test, too. I can't let my husband know.

They all rushed to the door, gasping for that cold, fresh air. Turns out they were trapped in a sauna, and it was 120 degrees in there. A wooden ladder was jammed against the door, so there was no way to open it from inside. They screamed through the window, but no one heard them. The heater kept blasting. If they stayed any longer, they'd be cooked alive. They chugged the last of their water. Mike grabbed a towel, wrapped it around a rock, and reached through the window, trying to knock the ladder loose. But the window was too small to see through, so he had to go by feel. His arm got shaky from holding it up, and the ladder didn't move an inch. He pulled the towel back. Jenna wanted to break the temperature sensor on the wall, but Renee said if that thing failed, the heat could shoot up to 200. They started arguing. Meanwhile, Mike noticed a wall sconce. He yanked off the lamp shade. He thought maybe if he short circuited it, and if it was on the same circuit as the heater, it could kill the power to the whole room. He asked Jenna for a towel, wrapped it around his hand, unscrewed the bulb, grabbed a bucket of water. Then he wrapped a spoon handle in the towel, dunked it in water, and shoved it into the socket. One second later, boom! The Lights went out and Mike dropped to the floor. He just electrocuted himself.

The White House and MAGA Republicans are freaking out after Donald Trump did not win the Nobel Peace Prize today. Instead with the Nobel committee awarding it to Venezuela and opposition leader Maria Carrera Machado, who is very well deserving of this extraordinary prize. And they're not happy because they thought that Donald Trump not only should win, but they're also not happy because he lost to a Latina woman. Laura Loomer, one of Donald Trump's closest people on the internet says, imagine thinking a woman who cries non stop about Nicholas Maduro has done more for the world than President Trump. What an absolute joke. Everyone knows Trump deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. More affirmative action. Nonsense. White House communications director Steven Chung said on his official account, President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars and saving lives. He has the heart of a humanitarian and there will be never be anyone like him who can move mountains with the sheer force of his will. The Nobel committee proved they place politics over peace. Not happy at the White House this morning. So spread the word. We're waiting for Trump's reaction. Follow along for more.

She became short of breath as I was carrying her to the ambulance. Help me. I'm not protecting her. 20 of atonement, 100 of stocks. Nadia, I'm gonna place a tube to help her. The conversation then shifted to the cause of her condition. Her father suggested it might be a silicone embolism, suspecting that Nadia's implant might have leaked, causing silicone to enter her bloodstream and possibly her lungs. The team was getting ready for a CT angiogram to confirm the diagnosis, but then things took a dramatic turn and shot up in her lungs. I'm in bag. We need to get her up for a CT angiogram, stat. Hold on, please. You know, I don't think I can let you go up there because you're not actually Naughty's father, are you? You're her surgeon. The doctor called the man into the room and started questioning him, revealing that he wasn't actually Nadia's father, he was her surgeon. The tension skyrocketed as the medical staff grilled him about his credentials. The surgeon admitted that he had practiced in Russia, but confessed he never got a medical license in the US he tried to justify himself by saying the community trusted him even though he didn't have formal certification and everyone relied on his medical skills. The doctor then pointed out that the implants he used came from the black market and they weren't guaranteed because he didn't have a legal medical license. Not exactly talking about an Earache here, my people need me. What can I do? Gee, I don't know. Um, refer him to a qualified position. The surgery I did was good. It was the implants he got off the black market because you don't have a license.

But the footprints on the floor. They made it clear this wasn't that simple. The coroner checked his body again. Still dead. But while everyone was freaking out, a glass of milk tipped over by itself. The cops froze. The captain swore the kid moved. The coroner checked again and saw his fingers were messed up, like he'd clawed his way out. Something felt seriously off. He told the captain to call the dad and bury the kid again immediately. At the same time, they found some weird footprints outside the house. Suddenly, the neighbor's kid climbed in through the window like it was just another day. Then the dead kid slowly turned his head and stared right at him. A scream came out of nowhere. The cops rushed in. Only found a backpack on the ground. That's when they knew they couldn't wait any longer. They had to take care of the body. They stuffed the kid in the fridge, even put a flower pot on top so he wouldn't get out. Not long after, the captain heard a creepy noise from the fridge and nearly jumped out of his skin.

I didn't breathe easy until my parents showed up after surgery. They looked at me safe and sound and treated that doctor like some damn lifesaver. My mom even hugged him. Just 5 hours ago, I was riding with my boyfriend. He wasn't paying attention. We crashed. My heart got hit bad, almost didn't make it. And the first thing I said when I woke up felt like someone kissed me. But my parents thought it was just anesthesia. Nobody expected what went down in that room. Once my parents left, the old doctor came back, asked carefully how I was doing. So I was innocent from how I talked, pulled out some ointment, saying he'd apply it to prevent a scar, lifted my shirt, letting him touch where he shouldn't. And somehow I didn't feel offended, even told him he was patient and caring like a dad. That mix of guilt and confusion hit me like salty water, choking me. My mom came back with food and caught us. The doctor said it was for the ointment. She checked there was no crossing of lines and finally relaxed. Two months later when I was discharged, my mom saw him getting handsy saying goodbye. It made her uneasy but thinking nothing happened in two months, she shrugged it off. After I got out, I realized Old B couldn't forget my face or my whispers every Night he watched outside my house, fantasizing I'd one day open the door and confess I'd marry him. His assistant told him I actually came. I brought a teddy bear and a thank you note, said I'd open it at home. He teased wanting to see it now. We talked until we were done. Then he let me leave. When he found out I was a med student, I said I could ask him if I needed help. My mom thought that was weird, told me not to wear such revealing skirts. I thought she was overreacting. That night, shopping with my friend, we were stalked again. He faked an encounter, sat next to me, used a ticket to get my friend away. My friend tried to touch him. I pulled back, refused, said I had homework and we were going to a movie. He lost it, flipped a trash can. I told my parents as soon as I got home, wanted a new doctor. Dad thought it was a misunderstanding, said the guy had awards, patients loved him. A little girl like me couldn't attract him. But mom remembered what she saw and supported me. Dad went to talk old be, laughed, said he was a doctor, not a criminal, showed my teddy and note, said if anything, I was the more forward one, claimed he was the best money could buy. Changing him would hurt my care. Dad decided not to switch, pushing me closer to danger. That Night, Old B snuck into my room, sniffed my doll clothes, bed sheets and pillow, replaced me. At the climax, I brought my boyfriend home, proposed on the spot and said yes. The kiss pushed him almost to attack, but my boyfriend accidentally hurt my chest. We stopped, left and turn. Old B just wanted to tear us apart. Next day he checked my boyfriend's follow up, talked before the main doctor arrived. Boyfriend recognized him, thanked him. Old B snatched his phone, texted friends saying my chest scar made him gag. The text got seen, dragged in my best friend. Boyfriend was questioned, broke up, check time stamp with friends. Coming home, my boyfriend waited at the door. I saw the doctor open, accuse him of only hurting me. Boyfriend got angry but with his leg injury was controlled. Doctor squeezed his hurt leg and tossed the cane. Boyfriend gave up, said he'd been tortured for life. I was shocked, discussing with my friend. The next second the doctor appeared, said he didn't know why my boyfriend broke into his house, warned next time he'd call the cops, handed a doll as apology. I freaked. My friend pulled me away, rejected again. The doctor went ballistic, tore the doll, couldn't release his rage. He just wanted a girl who liked him. I told my parents, insisted on a new doctor. Mom took me to get my records. He appeared trying to stop us. Mom refused, grab the records, left And that blew him up like never before. He found Mom's medical history, saw her chronic condition, meds needed regularly, allergic to one. He laced the bottle, resealed it, quickly got into her. I came home, saw her down, rushed her to the hospital. She survived. He showed up acting concerned. I saw him and firmly didn't want him there. His face fell, but a new plan formed. He wanted to keep me close until mom was discharged, continued stalking me. The day I hung up with mom, he crept closer. He plan is only just beginning.

He's always had blonde hair. Yet in the wedding photo, I saw a dark haired man reflected in the mirror. I told myself it was just the lighting, but when I compared other photos, nothing matched. He was blond in every single one. But if he was fake, why would he buy me a million dollar house? Why would he quit his high paying job just to take care of me after my car accident? He taught me to walk and read again with so much patience that even the nurses envied me. But now that tenderness chills me to the bone. I dragged my injured leg to the desk trying to find the wedding photo negatives. When I typed in my password, the system said it was wrong. Just as I was thinking he might have changed it, he suddenly came home early from grocery shopping. I pretended to look for a book, barely keeping calm. That day, he bought me a new phone, but there was no signal. He said the mountain blocked reception. But I remembered he was on the phone outside just two days ago, making sure I couldn't hear. When I asked who it was, he brushed it off as work and walked away. Ever since my accident, strange things have been happening. That night, I was hit by a car and the driver sent me to the hospital. Yet somehow my Husband was already there, fully dressed, waiting. The detective questioned me, but nothing seemed off and I thought it was just an accident. The next day, the driver came back saying he remembered seeing a white pickup leaving the scene. White pickup? The detective wanted to talk to my husband again. That call he took in secret was from the detective, but he never showed up. When the detective ran his name through the system, there was no record of him. The address he'd given was fake. The detective went there and found only an old woman who had never heard of any Russell. Later, they checked the hospital security footage. My husband was already in the parking lot before I arrived, sitting in a white pickup. My whole body froze while he was in the shower. I searched the house for proof of who he really was. All I found was a lighter. I told him to go buy groceries so I could keep looking. But when he left, he locked the door from outside. Luckily, I found a hairpin and picked the lock. Inside, I found a driver's license with my name on it. But it wasn't the name I use now. That's when I knew I had been given a new identity. I tried the name on that license as the password, and the computer unlocked. The negative showed the truth. The black haired man was my real husband. The blonde one was just there watching us. My memories rush back at once. My true husband was the man with black hair. Just as I reached for my phone, the internet cut off. I ran outside, but my phone still had no signal. When I opened the back cover, I saw the wires have been tampered with. I limped down the mountain, desperate to get away. But not long after, he realized he forgot his wallet and turned back. I fell in the garden, hands covered in dirt. I saw a man's body buried beneath the soil. My mind went blank.

To get close to him, I would stand by the window every night and watch him sleep. A mix of desire and madness filled me. I soon came up with a perfect plan. That day he was out, so I pretended I wanted to grab a meal. I brought some ingredients and knocked on my neighbor's door. While she was busy cooking, I overheard Laura talking about making a dessert for her boss. She wanted a promotion and a raise. That information sparked a big plan in my mind. After chatting for a while, Laura went to the bathroom. I quickly took poison from my bag and slipped it into the dessert meant for her boss. Laura, unaware, still thought I was a kind hearted new neighbor. Little did she know, from the moment I got close to him, a nightmare had quietly begun. When she brought the dessert to her boss, he took two bites and suddenly started foaming at the mouth. His body went into shock. Laura panicked and rushed to help him, taking him to the hospital. Violet, the hell did you put in that pie? Claudia is in the hospital because she ate your pie. Oh, calm down. All I did was show you how to make it possible that Claudia was allergic to one of the ingredients. Oh my god! She must have been allergic to something. So sorry. A clumsy lie easily fooled the innocent Laura. Not as sorry as you're gonna be. That ordinary dessert cost her the high paying job. To completely ruin her, I quickly contacted an old scam partner. At lunch, I Learned from Laura that their daughter got into her dream university. They couldn't afford the tuition and the couple was in a panic. I seized the opportunity and had my partner pose as an investment manager. He convinced Laura to put money into our fund for her daughter's education. With her daughter's schooling urgent and her job gone, Laura didn't hesitate. She met the financial manager at a cafe. The man, an experienced con, quickly eased her doubts. But when he pulled out the contract for her to sign, the unexpected happened.

When we surfaced, a vicious dog was closing in. Panic hit us hard. We ran toward the house, but I fell behind. The dog bit my pants and wouldn't let go. That tearing pain made me feel pure despair. Then I saw Jack, my boyfriend, raise his bow. His eyes were cold as ice, locked on the dog. With a sharp whistle, the arrow flew. I thought I was saved, but pain shot through my leg. The arrow had gone straight through it. The dog ran off, but I could barely speak from the pain. Jack rushed over, pretending to stay calm, though fear flashed in his eyes. I took a gulp of whiskey to numb the burning pain. My friend cut the arrowhead, then pulled it out. I almost crushed my teeth from the pain. Everyone knew Jack missed the shot, but he said it was on purpose to scare the dogs away. His tone sent chills down my spine. Before he finished, another dog crashed through the window. Jack didn't expect it would come so fast. He jumped on it, holding it down. Tom grabbed a metal rod and hit hard. The dog went still. The air reeked of blood. After that, we were all shaken. No one wanted to stay any longer. We packed to leave, but when we opened the door, two dogs were biting the plane safety ropes. That plane was our Only way out. They wanted to trap us here. When Jack checked again, the plane had drifted down the river. Hopelessness crushed me. We decided to move toward the shore. No sign of the dogs and the plane wasn't too far. Jack said he'd swim to it. I watched him go, uneasy. At first it looked fine, but when he got close, two dogs were lying on the wing. They stared at us with cold, calculating eyes. They had set a trap. Jack turned and swam back fast. We ran the moment he climbed ashore. The dogs didn't chase us, but the plane was gone for good. Back at the cabin, we locked every window and door. We threw the dead dog's body outside. The stench filled the air, but no one spoke. We sat there thinking those dogs weren't just smart, they worked together. We were trapped. No way out. Jack found a pulley leading to a garage. Maybe there was a car inside, but the rope was thin. Only I could try. Fear gripped me, but I knew I had to go. Wind cut across my face as I slid over. My breath was too loud. The dog started barking. I smashed the window and got inside. There was a car, but the battery was dead. No time to think. The dog squeezed through the door crack. Their growls froze my blood. I climbed through the sunroof, rolled under the car, then flipped up to Dodge. I survived. But getting back wouldn't be easy. The ceiling was too low. Only the rope could bring me back. I looked up at the other side. Jack was there watching. The air went still. My heart pounded. Everything now depended on that rope.

That's what he used to do with his grandma before she sadly passed. he started putting his cigarette out on someone else's balcony, putting their cigarette on that side. Wow, it's messed up. Well, if you do stuff like that, I'll talk with him for a second and told him not to ever do that again. Then I had him check out my slingshot again because the last time he saw it was the first day we met. And just wait till y'all see us in a Batman and Robin costume in this. This is what I picked you up in the first day we met. It's just been too cold to ride it since. Dakota's main problem now is he's letting these people stay the night at his apartment and they're stealing money from him. One of them broke the sink in his apartment and caused their rent to go up. They did not want Dakota to move out the trap house. Before I got in the apartment, he was squatting and doing some breaking bad type stuff. I would always talk to him and try to give him the best Advice, I take him shopping for clothes. I've gotten them like four phones. I really just try to be there when no one else would. I tried to get him an apartment, but it's kind of difficult. So while we are waiting, I got him a hotel for a couple of weeks, one to where he could take his dog, too. While he was there, he met a girl. That's actually how they met, by the way. Then when the time finally came, I helped him move into his new apartment. My goal now is to try to get him healthier, break all the bad habits, get away from the wrong people and live a good life because I think he deserves it.

He was sent to prison after disguising himself. The prison guard intentionally tripped Louis. Homer immediately knocked down the guards dining plate. They dragged Homer into a room to pretend to be punished. The guards start beating the steak. Homer couldn't bear to hear the steak being beaten and let out a painful scream. That made the Mafia trust Homer. So Fat Tony himself came to invite Homer to escape with him. The wall collapsed when he touched it. Fat Tony brought Homer to mourn his deceased wife. It made Homer miss Marge even more. Fat Tony thought Homer was sharing his grief. So Fat Tony put Homer through one last test and that was to burn down Mo's Tavern. Just as Homer was about to carry out his plan, Moe blew up his own saloon. At this point, Fat Tony had completely trusted Homer. He cut open Homer's hand and dripped blood on the photo. Homer was officially in the Mafia. He was touched by Fat Tony's passion for him. Then Fat Tony brought him to the beach to make a big deal. But their conversation was being overheard by the police. Homer advised Fat Tony to get out of there. Fat Tony suddenly realized that Homer was an undercover cop. He was so sad that he had a heart attack and died. Homer hugged Fat Tony and cried. He went to Fat Tony's grave to confess. Wake up. Homer, Fat Tony. This man was Fat Tony's cousin, Fit Tony. Homer begged Fit Tony to kill him, but Fit Tony finally chose to let Homer live on. With Fat Tony's memory, Fit Tony took his cousin's place. He was under a lot of stress and he started overeating. And that's how he ended up becoming Fat Tony.

Time suddenly froze. The Grim Reaper gave me a chance to change my fate. I can start and pause the final 15 seconds of my life at will. I'll use those 15 seconds to identify the killer and leave a message. Ideally, I'll take him down with me. Stop. 14 seconds remaining. I forced myself to endure the searing pain. Stand up. Stand up. I clearly saw the killer's face. It was my patient's daughter. Maybe she resents me because her mother died a few days ago, but I won't let the person who killed me walk free. Stand up. I scattered the powder from the table onto the floor, then grabbed the remote and turned off the lights. Stop. The powder will make her afraid to leave footprints and hesitate to enter. And turning off the lights will keep her from seeing what I'm doing. Stop. I darted to the desk, grabbed a marker and wrote down the killer's name. Stop. Death mocked me for leaving such obvious information. The killer will surely try to alter it, but that's exactly what I want. Get out. I smashed the vase, spread the water evenly across the surface, then threw the marker dozens of feet away. If the killer tries to alter the message I left, she'll instinctively grab the marker on the desk. That way, forensic experts can detect the difference in ink. But my plan goes far beyond that. If possible, I want to die with her. Stand up. Stop. I inserted two flower stems into the power outlet. That way the stems will conduct electricity. If she tries to alter my message, she'll touch the desk and get electrocuted. But that's still not enough. Stand up. I kicked over the bucket of water nearby. If she steps in the water, she'll become a conductor. The water on the desk and the floor will form a closed circuit, instantly generating 100 volts of electricity, killing her in one blow. Four seconds remaining. Just as I was about to move again, something unexpected happened. A second bullet came through the window. The killer had moved outside to finish me off in an instant. I had only point six one seconds left.

What the hell were you thinking? But the next second, I resurrected right where I was. I've already died 278 times because I'm trapped in a time loop. Each time I come back to life. The day before going to battle in the future world, a meteor brought monsters called mimics to fight them. Even a media officer like me who's never seen combat was dragged into this. I tried to stop this unwinnable war. I accurately named the instructors, three old souls and every soldier's childhood nickname. Ford Skinner, Griff. You're. He doesn't talk much, but there's a card game under the bed. Thanks a lot, asshole. I could even recite the numbers on the instructor's playing cards. You're very lives. I depend on it. Seeing their stunned expressions, I knew they believed me. One minute they thought I was schizophrenic. No matter how I resisted, I couldn't escape the fate of going to war. The sky was packed with missiles. Jets fell like rain behind you. This time I kindly saved him. The next second, I got flattened with meat Patty. It's fine. I can still respawn. This time I saved the soldier, dodged the fighter jet, but before I could celebrate, no problem. Restart. After my 250th resurrection, I finally survived past 1 km. I'm now unstoppable, easily dodging bullets and explosions. But when they saw my seemingly prophetic reflexes, the army's war goddess, Rita Froze in place. She told me to find her after I respawn. Before I could react, a cannon blast sent me back to the beginning. Resurrection number 2:50 one. I decided to sneak out during training to find Rita. After countless times being run over, I finally slipped out of the base. Turns out Rita also has the power of infinite resurrection. Only by winning this war can we break the loop to end the cycle. I had no choice but to endure Rita's brutal training. Even if I just fractured a bone, she'd shoot me without hesitation. She didn't have time to wait for me to heal, so I kept breaking bones and she kept sending me off. Your legs broken? No, I. I can still feel my toe.

He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing is cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term, they can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team and he's actually been practicing with Texas a m. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL because 1, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible but not likely. Number two.

And I just know Saban's at his 20 million dollar mansion in Florida right now going, hey, told you so. Should have listened to me. Cause this week, Tennessee's quarterback Nico Ealy, had a holdout because he wanted more NIL money. And it was just reported this morning that Tennessee is gonna be moving on from the guy. So basically, here's what's happening this year. Nico was slated to make $2.4 million from Tennessee's collective. But apparently that wasn't enough for Nico. And he saw Carson Beck go from Georgia to Florida, and he's getting 4 million. So basically, stopped showing up to practice and meetings and was holding out hoping that Tennessee would give him four million dollars. Long story short, Tennessee said no.

The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to Cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of him. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of this.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you want to know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 / 4 and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of it. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the snaps, he'll get another 250.

So today we're gonna be talking about the UMHB Crusaders down in Texas. It's the university of Mary Hardin Baylor, which is a Christian university and a D3 school. But yesterday they posted this picture to X which was their team GPA. The team had a GPA average of 2.72 with 15 players having a perfect 4.0 and 51 players having a 3.5 or above. Now at first look you're like 66 players with a GPA over 3.5 like that's good. But then that left us with some questions. If 66 players on the team have really good GPS, how did you get such a low average? Now for what it's worth, a team GPS that is good is considered 2.3 or higher so this 2.72 not too bad but then people started to do some digging on this team. They found that the UMHB Crusader football team has 192 players. One hundred ninety two. There are 18 quarterbacks on this football team. Can you imagine being the 18th string quarterback on your team? Not only did we find that there's 100.

Cause this week, Tennessee's quarterback Nico Ealy, had a holdout because he wanted more NIL money. And it was just reported this morning that Tennessee is gonna be moving on from the guy. So basically, here's what's happening this year. Nico was slated to make $2.4 million from Tennessee's collective. But apparently that wasn't enough for Nico. And he saw Carson Beck go from Georgia to Florida, and he's getting 4 million. So basically, stopped showing up to practice and meetings and was holding out hoping that Tennessee would give him four million dollars. Long story short, Tennessee said no. I mean, to be fair, Nico, like Tennessee's mascot, is the volunteers. He kind of knew what you signed up for. All jokes aside, though, this is kind of an insane move. And to me, the only logical explanation behind this is that Nico's camp just thinks he's not gonna succeed in the NFL, so they're trying to get him as much money as possible. Right?

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you want to know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by 4, and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is, Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of it. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man, Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string they got Trey Lance. If you remember a couple seconds ago I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush. And Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt, and although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the snaps, he'll get another 200.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you wanna know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by four, and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is, Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to Cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of him. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man, Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush. And Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt, and although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully, Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sits At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55%

So this man right here is Shamar Stuart from Texas A&M. He was drafted 17th overall by the Bengals this year. But Shamar here is the only first round pick to not have signed his rookie contract yet. Because the Bengals are trying to shaft him. this dispute happening with Shamar in the Bengals isn't about money. He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing is cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term. They can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team, and he's actually been practicing with Texas A M. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL, because, one, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible, but not likely. No. 2. He

So today, we're gonna be talking about the UMHB Crusaders down in Texas. It's the university of Mary Hardin Baylor, which is a Christian university and a D3 school. But yesterday, they posted this picture to X, which was their team GPA. The team had a GPA average of 2.72, with 15 players having a perfect 4.0 and 51 players having a 3.5 or above. Now, at first look, you're like, 66 players with a GPA over 3.5. Like, that's good. But then that left us with some questions. If 66 players on the team have really good GPS, how did you get such a low average? Now, for what it's worth, a team GPS that is good is considered 2.3 or higher. So this 2.72, not too bad. But then people started to do some digging on this team. They found that the UMHB Crusader football team has 192 players. 192! There are 18 quarterbacks on this football team. Can you imagine being the 18th string quarterback on your team? Not only did we find that, there's 100

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you wanna know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by four and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to Cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of him. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55%,

Basically just anyone wearing a commanders Jersey. And Jack decided to find the two smallest commanders fans who were just standing there doing nothing, and knocked this guy out. But he gives this guy a right hook for no reason and started randomly assaulting this other guy, in which, after the fact, he starts flexing and says that I don't fucking lose. And that viral video was even liked by Lamar Jackson. But NFL fans really didn't like this move, so they decided to ruin this guy's life. They first found his Facebook page, where it listed his job. And once that happened, everyone else started chiming in with their stories about it, like this guy saying, I knew this kid throughout high school. He's a total piece of shit. Got kicked out of three different Baltimore private schools. And a notable moment was his expulsion from Saint Paul's for putting his hmm. On a kid with special needs. He's disgusting, but his father's absolutely loaded, super rich. His expulsion story should tell you all you need to know.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you wanna know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by four and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to Cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of him. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55%,

So this man right here is Shamar Stuart from Texas a M. He was drafted 17th overall by the Bengals this year. But Shamar here is the only first round pick to not have signed his rookie contract yet because the Bengals are trying to shaft him. this dispute happening with Shamar in the Bengals isn't about money. He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing is cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they tried to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term, they can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team and he's actually been practicing with Texas a m. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL because 1, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible, but not likely. No. 2, he could ask for a trade.

When their father, Jamil Penn returned home, he smelled the smell of grilled meat and thought it was his wife cooking. When he walked into the kitchen, he realized that something terrible had happened. His two children are in the oven. By the time he rescued them, it was already too late. Jamil trembled and dialed 9 1 1 to report the incident. The police arrived at the scene and immediately arrested their mother, 24 year old Lamora Williams. Even more heartbreaking is that investigators are no longer able to identify two children. Lamora told the police that she doesn't know who killed her child. Then she blamed her cousin for the crime. And finally she said it was her sister who killed the children. She is uncertain and provided false information. Lemora is charged with two counts of murder. But in court, Lemora's sister claimed that Lemora had suffered from serious mental health problems since childhood. She even tried to end her own life. After psychological evaluation, it was confirmed that Lamora William has cognitive impairment. The final judge sentenced her to 5 years in prison. Do you think this is a fair judgment?

NASA County Police say a 61 year old man was magnetically pulled into an MRI Wednesday while wearing a large metal chain. He apparently walked into an unauthorized area at NASA Open MRI in Westbury while a scan was underway and he was drawn into the machine. He's now in critical condition. That really make me upset because that should never happen. Police say the victim is from Long Island and was not a patient. Rather he was at the facility with someone else. NASA Open MRI, which has several other locations, offers both open and closed scans at nearby North Shore University Hospital. Medical professionals say they're shocked and that rigorous safety protocol should be in place to avoid attracting metal objects. If this was a chain that was wrapped around the neck, I could imagine any kind of strangulation injuries that could happen, asphyxiation, cervical spine injuries. If the patient was slammed against the m R, I, you know, any kind of blunt force trauma that we can think about could happen.

Let me explain. So for those of you who don't know, Cool Kicks isn't just a regular sneaker shop, it's a pop culture hotspot. On their channel, they have almost 2 million subscribers where they film some of the most top tier celebrities shopping at their store from influencers to streamers to rappers, just about any celebrity you can think of have shopped there and doing this. Cool kicks turned the resale game into entertainment. And this made the shop a tourist destination in Los Angeles and one of the most recognized names in sneaker culture. But just as recent as yesterday thing, things turned for the worse. And this actually happened live on a stream which was abruptly stopped because of loud noises outside of the store. And then videos and photos started to appear on social media from concern and fans of police at the warehouse where they had multiple people in handcuffs and stacks of sneaker boxes being loaded into a truck.

He didn't buy one or two, he bought three cyber trucks hoping to be part of the revolution. But this week, Shaq confirmed he's out. He sold every single one of them. And while Shaq's name makes headlines, the real story is the truck itself. Once marketed as a symbol of innovation, the cyber truck has quickly become a rolling punch line.

Owning a cyber truck doesn't make you look powerful. It makes you look like a test subject in a failed experiment. Tesla said this was the future, but it's shedding owners, losing trust and sinking in value faster than anyone expected.

Let me explain. So for those of you who don't know, Cool Kicks isn't just a regular sneaker shop, it's a pop culture hotspot. On their channel, they have almost 2 million subscribers where they film some of the most top tier celebrities shopping at their store from influencers to streamers to rappers, just about any celebrity you can think of have shopped there and doing this. Cool kicks turned the resale game into entertainment. And this made the shop a tourist destination in Los Angeles and one of the most recognized names in sneaker culture. But just as recent as yesterday thing, things turned for the worse. And this actually happened live on a stream which was abruptly stopped because of loud noises outside of the store. And then videos and photos started to appear on social media from concern and fans of police at the warehouse where they had multiple people in handcuffs and stacks of sneaker boxes being loaded into a truck.

Nassau County police say a 61 year old man was magnetically pulled into an MRI Wednesday while wearing a large metal chain. He apparently walked into an unauthorized area at NASA Open MRI in Westbury while a scan was underway, and he was drawn into the machine. He's now in critical condition. That really make me upset because that should never happen. Police say the victim is from Long Island and was not a patient. Rather, he was at the facility with someone else. NASA Open MRI, which has several other locations, offers both open and closed scans at nearby North Shore University Hospital. Medical professionals say they're shocked and that rigorous safety protocol should be in place to avoid attracting metal objects. If this was a chain that was wrapped around the neck, I could imagine any kind of strangulation injuries that could happen. Asphyxiation, cervical spine injuries. If the patient was slammed against the M R I, you know, you. Any kind of blunt force trauma that we can think about could happen.

A customer was dissatisfied with the temperature of the spicy soup and poured boiling soup onto the cashier causing serious injuries to the cashier. At present, the victim has filed a lawsuit seeking compensation of $3 million. Thirty one year old Amanda Nicole Martinez previously ordered a take out menu soup to bring home. Subsequently, she angrily returned to the store claiming that the temperature of the soup was too high and that the plastic from the takeaway box had melted and fallen into the soup. Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave. Otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off. But the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

But the country, Terenzia, it doesn't exist anywhere. Witnesses say she looked completely ordinary, like any tourist. But when agents told her Teresa isn't real, she froze, then whispered. Then this isn't my world, she asked me. Is this America? I said, yes, of course. Then she whispered America, like she had landed in the wrong place.

A customer was dissatisfied with the temperature of the spicy soup and poured boiling soup onto the cashier causing serious injuries to the cashier. At present, the victim has filed a lawsuit seeking compensation of $3 million. Thirty one year old Amanda Nicole Martinez previously ordered a take out menu soup to bring home. Subsequently, she angrily returned to the store claiming that the temperature of the soup was too high and that the plastic from the takeaway box had melted and fallen into the soup. Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup, but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave. Otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly, the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it, she immediately ran to wash it off. But the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face and blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards, the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial, Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

And there's a vulnerability with the point of sale machines that he was able to exploit and get basically double his money. He would, uh, do a transaction that was canceled about halfway through and by the end of it, the point of sale machine would give him double his money back. And he would leave posted information how to trick the Walmart checkout machines into giving cash back on certain types of purchases. Police say in south metro Atlanta, this guy apparently was not the only one observed doing it.

But the next morning he got a shocking call from the army sergeant. Turns out he accidentally broke the pull up record and now the army wanted him to enlist since he wasn't doing great in school. His parents actually agreed and sent him to basic training, which meant he had just five days before being transferred to a real military base. But instead of panicking, he came up with the funniest escape plan ever. For the first two days, he quietly watched the sergeants taking notes on each recruit, how many push UPS they could do, how fast they ran, everything. He noticed they kept all the records in a small office near the dorms. So one night he snuck in and edited the notes. On the final day, he intentionally bombed the pull up test. The sergeant was confused. This was the same kid and who crushed the record back at school. But then the guy told him he must be confusing him with his identical twin brother Tay.

In March, Christopher Greggor, a father, brought his six year old son, Corey Mckilolo, to the gym for exercise. According to the surveillance footage, Corey was running wildly on the treadmill and was thrown off six times in a row, each time facing down. However, his father was watching from the side. Not only did he not stop his son, but he also forced him to keep running on it. Corey's mother said that after Corey got home, he kept reporting that he was not feeling well, but Gregor didn't care. A few days later, Corey had difficulty breathing and an epileptic seizure. The doctor took rescue measures, but ultimately failed to save Corey's life. Court documents stated that Corey's deceased was due to a blunt impact on the chest and abdomen, followed by a torn liver. It was determined that it was caused by a fall while running. In court, Gregor stated that he had not harmed his son. After the judge watched the surveillance footage, he angrily sentenced him to 25 years in prison.

Judge Kevin Mullins was shot and killed by the town sheriff in front of the camera in his office. He once turned the prison in Lectola County into a brothel to satisfy his and his nauseating friends filthy fantasies. Bollins and his friends organized such parties in the county prison and other buildings in town, selecting the female prisoners they wanted. As a reward for these women, he will shorten their sentences or alleviate any punishment they face. If these women are unwilling to participate or refuse, he will threaten them, either sentencing them to the maximum sentence or kicking them to their most painful place. On March 12th, Sheriff Marshall was invited to a party and discovered that his wife and daughter were also involved. His wife was beaten by Mullen's for disobedience and Sheriff Marshall angrily questioned Mullen's before taking his wife and daughter home. Two days later, his daughter ended her life due to her inability to accept reality. Furious, Marshall rushed into Mullins's office, pulled out his weapon, and fired three shots in a row. He died before the police arrived. Now Marshall is accused of first degree murder. He may never see his family again. Do you think he is a hero or a criminal?

Surveillance video shows a 24 year old woman fighting off her attacker inside a gym at a Tampa apartment complex. She is thrown to the ground but does not give up. Ashley Alma says she was exercising alone last month around 9:30 at night when she let the suspect in the gym. She says sometimes people forget their key FOB so she didn't think twice. Alma is a bodybuilder and figured if she kept fighting, her attacker would get tired and give up. That was my, you know, thought the entire time. Cause the more fight you put in, I do believe they would get more tired cause they see that dang, this girl is fighting, you know, and you can see at the end of the video he was tired. After struggling with him for more than a minute, she is able to break free. I was overwhelmed with emotion how proud I was that this victim wasn't gonna allow herself to be raped and how hard she fought and the strength she had. Thomas Jones is facing numerous charges including sexual battery, kidnapping and false imprisonment.

She cried the hardest I ever cried in my life. The life changing tragedy had its origins during a vacation in the Caribbean with her husband. Marie says she was using her key card to access her hotel when she accidentally nicked herself on her wrist. It was a tiny little scratch, a silly accident. It hardly hurt. When Marie came home, her dog Taylor greeted her with lots of kisses. But the dog also licked Marie's scratch. Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders. It turns out that her dog's saliva carried a bacteria called capnocytophaga. It's quite common in dogs, but what happened to Marie is a very rare occurrence. Her husband Matthew is doing his best to lift her spirits. I love her to death. She's everything to me.

Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flicked with, even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house. And many allege the situation might be much worse than now.

Judge Kevin Mullins was shot and killed by the town sheriff in front of the camera in his office. He once turned the prison in Lectola County into a brothel to satisfy his and his nauseating friends filthy fantasies. Bollins and his friends organized such parties in the county prison and other buildings in town, selecting the female prisoners they wanted. As a reward for these women, he will shorten their sentences or alleviate any punishment they face. These women are unwilling to participate or refuse. He will threaten them, either sentencing them to the maximum sentence or kicking them to their most painful place. On March 12, Sheriff Marshall was invited to a party and discovered that his wife and daughter were also involved. His wife was beaten by Mullins for disobedience, and Sheriff Marshall angrily questioned Mullins before taking his wife and daughter home. Two days later, his daughter ended her life due to her inability to accept reality. Furious, Marshall rushed into Mullins's office, pulled out his weapon, and fired three shots in a row. He died before the police arrived. Now Marshall is accused of first degree murder. He may never see his family again. Do you think he is a hero or a criminal?

A man forcibly dragged a woman behind the Monument and after a while she staggered away. This terrible scene happened to be witnessed by a person who was watching the Key West webcam. He lived 16 miles away in Boston and immediately called the Key West police. Thanks for calling from Boston, but bear with me. This is going to sound crazy, but I'm at work and I had the, you know, the southern most Red Point camp. Yeah, I could almost swear that I saw somebody get raped. The police report stated that the caller who made the long distance call to 9 1 1 happened to be watching a web cam at the time of the incident. It looked like she was fighting. She fell flat on her face. We were able to log into the cam and provide that video to the police department and the state's attorney's office. The police arrested the attacker, Carrie Calvin Gasog, 37 years old, who was an Uber driver. Justice in Key West has been upheld thanks to a sharp eyed citizen who was watching from afar in Boston. The suspect pleaded guilty to sexual assault charges and was sentenced to 10 years in prison just yesterday.

Before we even got into the park, it cost me $30 just for parking. And even being a Florida resident, tickets for a family of five with one child under 10 was still $974. The rest of the family decided they want to go to dinner at Downtown Disney Springs. This place was my literal hell. Totally in. Two hundred and forty five dollars twenty seven cents. The grand total for our day was one thousand three hundred ninety one dollars. Ninety one cents. Kind of had a feeling it would go viral. It's very relatable. It's family friendly. Disney's always a hot topic and we're, we're all trying to pinch pennies. So that video was probably my therapy as I was going through the day. The kids were smiling, sometimes fighting in between the lines. Uh, my wife was having a grand old time. Meanwhile, mine was just swipe the card over and over and over. And it started with the tik get purchase and then it ran right into the parking and then it just was like a cash cow for the rest of the day. So I kind of had an idea that people would be able to relate to it. Uh, just maybe not so much.

The man who put up the fence says he had finally had it with students trespassing and leaving trash in his yard. He figured the fence would keep them out. I'm not in charge of other people's children. All I can do is protect myself. But jolted neighbors thought the fence was too extreme. They called police, and police called public works, who questioned whether the fence encroached on a county easement. Show me what's the truth, you know, everybody just giving me different words. The relentless homeowner not giving in because he says the signs posted in his front yard did nothing. It says no trespassing. What? You don't like kids? Me, I'm, I'm a parent and I don't want any children around here to get electrocuted. That's a little too extreme. I mean, you're gonna let the kids get electrocuted? That's not cool.

And the city told us because the home was blocking the road, it was a safety hazard and because of its condition, it couldn't be moved, only torn down. Hugo says they saved only what they and a group of kind strangers could grab before the demolition. Most of their belongings were left behind. Hugo says he was moving because the land he had been renting was sold. He says he quickly hired someone to help him relocate. This is the contract Hugo says was written by Jose Antonio Serratos, the owner of Serratos Mobile Home company. According to Hugo, Sir Rattles promised to move his home in just six hours and he paid a money upfront. The job was never finished. Hugo says the moving company's trailer broke, three tires popped and his family's home was left abandoned. He says the moving company hasn't offered any help.

And that we were the lowest point in this area, and that all the water would. Would flow to us. That's when they decided to take tens of thousands of dollars out of their savings to build their own burn. It was our last option. We talked to several contractors, and they suggested that we do that.

Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing. With many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all, they may to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flicked, with even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be, but what they would do to him.

This is going to sound crazy, but I'm at work and I had the, you know, the southern most Red Point camp. Yeah, I could almost swear that I saw somebody get raped. The police report stated that the caller who made the long distance call to 9 1 1 happened to be watching a web cam at the time of the incident. It looked like she was fighting. She fell flat on her face. We were able to log into the cam and provide that video to the police department and the state's attorney's office. The police arrested the attacker, Carrie Calvin Gasog, 37 years old, who was an Uber driver. Justice in Key West has been upheld thanks to a sharp eyed citizen who was watching from afar in Boston. The suspect pleaded guilty to sexual assault charges and was sentenced to 10 years in prison just yesterday.

When asked to put his bag on the table, he tells police, I'm not ready and turns and walks away. Suspicious officers ask that the pilot be tracked through the airport, and these surveillance cameras show the 37 year old finding an escalator heading down a floor to a men's bathroom in late July. He's in that bathroom for only 30 seconds, where police say they later found a bottle of vodka stuffed in one of the trash cans. Schroder then heads back to the checkpoint, telling an officer he had to go back to the pilots lounge to get his iPad. Schroder passes and gets on the jetliner into the first officer's seat, but police officers board and ask the pilot to leave the cockpit. Authorities say when they tested the pilot's blood alcohol level two and a half hours later, it was under the limit, but authorities say when he was in the cockpit, he was likely over the limit for pilots.

You see, since Jeffrey Dahill was the one responsible for emptying all these parking meters in the first place, there was no way his boss would know if a stash was a few dollars short. The total amount was only counted after Jeffrey dropped these coins off. So from then on, he simply began stealing a bit here and there from every single parking meter he emptied, since there were just so many meters in his area. Before long, he was pocketing between 200 to 600 dollars in three quarters every week. Jeffrey probably thought he'd hit the Jackpot, so there was no way for him to ever be caught. As it turns out, he was actually right. There really wasn't a way. But little did he know it wouldn't even matter, since he would soon accidentally turn himself in. You see, every time Jeffrey was depositing his stolen coins, he would not only use the bank branch right near his parking meters, he would also still even be wearing his parking uniform. But somehow these bank workers never ask questions. And it was only five years later that they finally became suspicious about his uniform and reported him to the police. By then, Jeffrey had already stolen more than $90,000. After he was arrested, he was forced to pay everything back and also spent 17 days in jail. Jeffrey later said this ruined his life since he lost his job and his wife also left him.

His wife was beaten by Mullins for disobedience and Sheriff Marshall angrily questioned Mullins before taking his wife and daughter home. Two days later, his daughter ended her life due to her inability to accept reality. Furious, Marshall rushed into Mullins's office, pulled out his weapon and fired three shots in a row. He died before the police arrived. Now Marshall is accused of first degree murder. He may never see his family again. Do you think he is a hero or a criminal?

This mom is adjusting to her new normal after losing her hands and legs because of all things, a dog lick. Marie Trainer woke up from a 10 day coma to find her limbs had been amputated. She cried the hardest I ever cried in my life. The life changing tragedy had its origins during a vacation in the Caribbean with her husband. Marie says she was using her key card to access her hotel when she accidentally nicked herself on her wrist. It was a tiny little scratch, a silly accident. It hardly hurt. When Marie came home, her dog Taylor greeted her with lots of kisses. But the dog also licked Marie's scratch. Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders. It turns out that her dog's saliva carried a bacteria called capnocytophaga. It's quite common in dogs, but what happened to Marie is a very rare occurrence. Her husband Matthew is doing his best to lift her spirits. I love her to death. She's everything to me.

So he just nervously waited in his house, expecting police to show up at any moment. But after a few weeks had passed, they never came. So he thought they may have just cleared his record.

He got married, launched a construction company and volunteered to help youth avoid making the same mistakes he made.

Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flicked with, even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be but what they would do to him.

They haven't formally offered me a job yet. Um, the district manager reached out to me after this occurred, and he said he would like maybe for me to be a secret shopper. And do you think you'll take him up on that? Absolutely, ma'am. Waffle House for life, by the way. Alex tells us he did go back the next day, and he paid for his meal.

A haunting viral video shows what allegedly appeared like the boy was cowering after being handed a box at a supermarket, with many parental experts saying it was not a flinch, but seemingly a brace for impact. Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing. With many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all, they may to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flicked, with even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be, but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house, and many allege the situation might be much worse now.

But the next morning he got a shocking call from the army sergeant. Turns out he accidentally broke the pull up record and now the army wanted him to enlist since he wasn't doing great in school. His parents actually agreed and sent him to basic training, which meant he had just five days before being transferred to a real military base. But instead of panicking, he came up with the funniest escape plan ever. For the first two days, he quietly watched the sergeants taking notes on each recruit, how many push UPS they could do, how fast they ran, everything. He noticed they kept all the records in a small office near the dorms. So one night he snuck in and edited the notes. On the final day, he intentionally bombed the pull up test. The sergeant was confused. This was the same kid and who crushed the record back at school. But then the guy told him he must be confusing him with his identical twin brother Tay. When the sergeant checked the school notes, sure enough, Tay was now listed as the pull up champ. So they sent the guy home. But later that week, Tay got a surprise call from the army.

Judge Kevin Mullins was shot and killed by the town sheriff in front of the camera in his office. He once turned the prison in Lectola County into a brothel to satisfy his and his nauseating friends filthy fantasies. Bollins and his friends organized such parties in the county prison and other buildings in town, selecting the female prisoners they wanted. As a reward for these women, he will shorten their sentences or alleviate any punishment they face. If these women are unwilling to participate or refuse, he will threaten them, either sentencing them to the maximum sentence or kicking them to their most painful place. On March 12th, Sheriff Marshall was invited to a party and discovered that his wife and daughter were also involved. His wife was beaten by Mullen's for disobedience and Sheriff Marshall angrily questioned Mullen's before taking his wife and daughter home. Two days later, his daughter ended her life due to her inability to accept reality. Furious, Marshall rushed into Mullins's office, pulled out his weapon, and fired three shots in a row. He died before the police arrived. Now Marshall is accused of first degree murder. He may never see his family again. Do you think he is a hero or a criminal?

Portland, Oregon became my destination. Clean slate where nobody knew my story. Meanwhile, she discovered reality. Landlords don't accept I'm going to be a doctor payment. When the electricity shut off three days later, she finally understood that I hadn't been dead weight. I've been the foundation. Her texts started week one, calls began week two. 27. In one day, I deleted every message, unread every call, go to voicemail. By month three, she'd hired a private investigator. I landed a construction management job, bought a house with a yard, joined a hiking group, started dating a graphic designer who had her own career and actually seemed interested in my thoughts. After a year, I proposed. Three years after that parking lot, she tracked me down through medical database records, showed up at my work, my house, even got police called for trespassing. She cornered me at Home Depot on a Saturday afternoon. Please just give me five minutes. For what? To apologize, to ask for another chance. You had eight years of chances. You use them all up in a parking lot. I was stressed. I said things I didn't mean. I've regretted it every single day. Which part do you regret? Calling me? Dead weight. Discovering that dead weight was keeping your life afloat. She tried explaining how hard residency had been, but she realized she'd given up the best thing in Her life. So when you thought you'd be wealthy and successful, you threw me away. Now that reality hit and you're struggling, suddenly I'm the best thing that ever happened to you. I love you. I've all always loved you. I'm engaged. We're getting married in September. The words hit her like a physical blow. Two weeks later, she showed up at my workplace claiming a medical emergency. I handed her two things, a restraining order and a wedding invitation. I want you to understand that I'm not just moving on from you. I've already moved on completely. Six months later, I married my fiance. My ex wife wanted a fresh start with no dead weight. I gave her exactly that.

I signed them without argument and disappeared so completely that three years later, she was still searching. Eight years of working double shifts to pay her medical school tuition, eight years of frozen dinners, canceled vacations and being told once I graduate, everything will be different. The graduation ceremony was on a Thursday in may. I took the day off work, bought a new shirt. This was supposed to be our moment, our achievement, our future finally beginning. When they called her name, I stood up and clapped harder than anyone else. The ceremony ended around noon. I waited by the car while she posed with classmates. That diploma clutched like a golden ticket. When she finally walked over, I expected a hug. Instead, she handed me a vanilla envelope. Divorce papers, she said, like she was discussing the weather. I already signed my part. This wasn't a spur of the moment decision. This was planned. Look, I don't need you anymore. I have my degree, job offers, future. You were helpful during school, but that chapter is over. No dead weight. Eight years of marriage reduced to two words, helpful and dead weight. Her colleagues were gathering around us watching. I open the envelope. Everything already filled out. Assets divided, apartment claimed. Then I did something that surprised everyone. I pulled out a pen and signed every page right there in the Parking lot. I ended our marriage with the same casualness she'd started this conversation there. Congratulations on your graduation and your divorce. Her mouth drop popped open. She'd expected drama, begging anger. You're not going to fight this. Why would I fight for someone who just called me dead weight? I walked away from the car, leaving her standing there with her diploma in one hand and our signed divorce papers in the other. Three days later, I was gone from the state. The beauty of being married to someone who never paid attention to finances. She had no idea what I controlled. The apartment she thought she was getting. Lease in my name only paid for my personal account for two years. I closed our joint.

So from Super Bowl 1 in 1967 all the way until the 90s, the NFL never spent more than $1,000 a year getting the field ready for the big game. And the whole process would only take about a week. But now the Super Bowl is a billion dollar event and over 100 million people are going to watch it. So that's why the NFL now spends nearly two years preparing the grass for each Super Bowl. And what's interesting is the grass being used this year may be an advantage for the Forty Niners. So for Super Bowl 57 last year in Scottsdale, Arizona, the grass was grown at a local farm for 18 months. Then a few weeks before the game, it was brought to the stadium where it would sit outside in the sun during the day and then rolled into the stadium at night to avoid the cold. The cost last year was $800,000. But if you remember, the field was actually terrible. Players on both teams were slipping everywhere. It was a disaster. They had to replace their cleats. So will it be better this year? Well, the grass from this Super Bowl is coming.

So this is Max McGee. And in 1967, he was a 34 year old backup wide receiver for the Green Bay Packers. He only had four receptions all year, and he planned on retiring after the season. So the night before Super Bowl won in Los Angeles between the Chiefs and Packers. Max wasn't worried about getting rest before the big game. He wanted to go party. So after the final eleven PM room check, he snuck out of the hotel and went out with two flight attendants he met. Max spent the entire night drinking. He didn't sleep, and when he finally returned to the hotel at 6:30 in the morning, he was greeted by their quarterback bark star in the lobby, who was already up getting ready for the game. Max thought he wasn't going to play that day, and in the pre game meeting, he actually told their star wide receiver Boyd Dowler that he better not get hurt because Max was way too hungover to play. However, of course, his worst nightmare came true. Dowler separated his shoulder on the first drive, and coach

I have a word that I set up beforehand and I'm gonna give you all random letters from that word. Okay, so two letters per person and there's three of us playing. I'm sorry, did you print these out? Your goal is to find out the word without saying what letters you have. So what can we communicate? You can say if you have a vowel or not. I got a vowel. Likewise. I don't though. I have two of the same letter. That's fine to say. Could I say my letter sounds like goo? No. Okay. How about if you were to spell it out? It would kind of look like a? No. Or if we were to look at the alphabet, it would be No. 8. No, you cannot say the sound shape or location of the letter. How about this? One of my letters can refer to a certain yellow and black bug. There we go. Oh, my turn. Think pirates smart. So he has R's. I got it too. They travel to 7 C's.

For what? I'm trying to buy a tune right now and all these companies are offering different stage tunes. I don't really know what that means. Well, to be honest with you, it's all really just marketing. What do you mean? So the tunes that you're looking at, how much power is the stage one version gonna give you versus the stage two? Well, the website said stage one dynoed in at 2:40 to the wheels and stage two dynoed in at 2:70 to the wheels. So what does that tell you? Uh, the higher the stage, the more power. Yeah, pretty much. Stage 1 tunes are perfect for lightly modified or stock cars. Once you jump up in stages, that's usually when you have to buy more parts. Wait, what? Why can't I just run the stage 2 right now? Cause your clutch is garbage. When you look at buying an aftermarket clutch, you're gonna have to do with stages all over again. Stage 1 clutch can handle a certain amount of power, whereas the stage 3 clutch can handle way more. You get what I'm saying? Yeah, I think I'm starting to get it now. But what did you mean when you said it's all just marketing? In the real world, stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, all of that means squat. But I thought you just said it's like power tears. Yeah, it is, but it's really Only helpful if you know the platform. Say we toss the stage 2 tune on the Civic Si and we go and race a stage 1 version.

Uh, why you asking?

What exactly are they doing, and how do I do it to my car? Well, first of all, you absolutely don't need it on your car, but I'll tell you how it works. Okay, fair enough. So, NOS stands for Nitrous Oxide System. You remember those blue bottles they would show hidden in the trunk or under the seats? Yeah. Looked pretty cool. Well, those are NOS bottles, and inside those bottles, it's nitrous oxide, but in its liquid form. Often times, people think NOS is a different type of gasoline that makes your car go faster. Wait, it's not? No, but it does work in unison with your gasoline. Wait, dad, I'm kind of confused. Remember the basic principles of an engine? Air, fuel, spark, and compression. Yeah, I got that. Some people have their system set up so when they hit that button, it shoots nitrous into the cylinders or into the intake manifold. And again, it's liquid when it's in the bottle, but when it goes into the engine, it's no longer liquid. So it's air. Yeah, exactly. It's boost. But without turbo chargers or superchargers. Of course, you can still run nitrous on boost.

What's the cheap, easy mod that I could do to unlock some extra horsepower? But what do you have in your car already? Nothing. It's bone stock. The cheapest and easiest thing you can do is toss on an aftermarket intake. Really? And that'll make my car go faster. Yeah, but not by much. How does that even work though? Okay, so the basics of an engine, you got air, fuel and spark. Those three things are the basic principles of an engine. Okay, with modern cars like the Subaru WRX, you actually don't need an aftermarket intake unless you're trying to make big numbers. But since you're trying to mod a car from the 90s, I assume the factory airbox is kind of restrictive and that's a problem. Why can you breathe better with one or two nostrils? 2. Exactly. Your factory airbox is like breathing through one nostril when you should be doing it with two. If your car is not getting enough oxygen, the fuel is not gonna be burning as efficiently, meaning there's still some extra potential to be unlocked. Oh, I get it now. When you toss on the aftermarket intake, the car gets more adequate oxygen, therefore the fuel burns more efficiently. And because of that, your car is able to squeeze out some extra horses. So I can just toss any intake on my car. Well, you have options.

Uh, why are you asking? Well, I was watching fast and furious, and every single time someone's about to lose, they hit this red button that says NOS, and then next thing you know, the car is going way faster than it ever did. What exactly are they doing, and how do I do it to my car? Well, first of all, you absolutely don't need it on your car, but I'll tell you how it works. Okay, fair enough. So, NOS stands for Nitrous Oxide System. You remember those blue bottles they would show hidden in the trunk or under the seats? Yeah. Looked pretty cool. Well, those are NOS bottles, and inside those bottles, it's nitrous oxide, but in its liquid form. Often times, people think NOS is a different type of gasoline that makes your car go faster. Wait, it's not? No, but it does work in unison with your gasoline. Wait, dad, I'm kind of confused. Well, remember the basic principles of an engine? Air, fuel, spark, and compression. Yeah, I got that. Well, some people have their system set up so when they hit that button, it shoots nitrous into the cylinders or into the intake manifold. And again, it's liquid when it's in the bottle, but when it goes into the engine, it's no longer liquid. So it's air. Yeah, exactly. It's boost, but without turbochargers or superchargers. Of course, you can still run nitrous on boosted car.

It stands for dual clutch transmission. But what does that mean? Well, dual means two. So there's two clutches. Two clutches. I thought my car only had one. Yeah. You drive a manual, your car does have one clutch. This one right here got two. Wait, I'm confused. Is it an automatic or a manual? Well, automatic cars have torque converters. The M4 over there doesn't use torque converter. So it's a manual. Yeah, kind of sorta. Think of it as an automatic manual. Wait, wait, wait, hold up. You're kind of losing me here. What do you mean it's a automatic manual. So it has a computer to help it predict which gear comes next, like an automatic, right? Uh huh. But the way the transmission is set up is more similar to that of a manual. Wait, so what's the purpose of having two clutches then? Well, these two clutches overlap one another. This allows both clutches to work on the same input shaft. Same shaft, technically two, but they do overlap each other. Not only that, but the gears operate on piston powered shift forks. Dad, I'm hearing what you're saying, but what does all that mumbo jumbo mean? That means you could shift extremely fast. So how do I know if a car is DCT? If you hear a really aggressive and quick shift, that's a DCT. Some of them have paddles.

Yeah, it's pretty sick. Well, that happens because of break boosting, but what exactly is it? Don't forget turbo chargers run off of exhaust gases. When you just mash the throttle, you're not gonna get a face full of boost as you'd expect. Exhaust gases gotta build up enough pressure to spin the turbine. Even then you're not making peak boost. The time in between you mashing your throttle and then experiencing all the boost, that's called boost lag. A lot of these high horsepower cars are running large single turbos and the bigger your turbo, the more lag you're gonna experience, really? So I gotta wait for all that power. Well, there's a couple ways to get around boost lag. Some people are on anti lag setups, which keeps the turbo spooled up when you let off the throttle. That way when you step back on it, you already got all the boost you need. But what if I can't afford anti lag? That's where the Peach rings come in, plain and simple. If you don't have anti lag, then you can brake boost. That's where you step on the brakes and the gas at the same time. But wouldn't that just cause you to brake check if you step on it too hard? Yeah, but your left foot's gonna monitor the brakes and your right foot's gonna Go on the throttle. And if you get the right amount of brake pressure to the point where you can start hopping on throttle and building up boost but not moving too much, then you, my friend, have success.

Is that when something breaks in the car from too much boost? No, no, it's nothing bad. But have you ever seen those videos of cars racing on the freeway and their brakes look like peach rings, just glowing hot red? Yeah, well, that's from break boosting. But what exactly is it? Well, you remember last time how we talked about turbo charges and how they have boost lag? Yeah. If you wanna bypass that, like you brake boost. So how do you do it? Well, first off, your car needs to have a turbo. There's no point in doing it if you have a supercharger. So basically, when you're on the gas pedal, you stick your left foot on the brake pedal. Why would you hop on the brakes if you're trying to go faster? Well, you're not gonna be slamming on the brakes. You're just pressing it enough to the point where you can actually build a boost without accelerating. And once you have a desirable amount of boost, you just let off the brakes and mash the throttle. Next thing you know, you're getting hit with a face full of boost and you take off like a rocket ship. It's like poor man's anti lag. But are there any downsides to it? Wait, what's anti lag? Wait, wait. One question at a time. Don't worry, we'll get into anti lag next time. But as far as downsides, you're gonna run through your brakes way faster. Than if you were to use them normally, and your brakes are gonna be overheating like crazy. So the stopping power ain't too great. But it is a lot of fun. Yes.

Stage 1 clutch can handle a certain amount of power, whereas the stage 3 clutch can handle way more. You get what I'm saying? Yeah, I think I'm starting to get it now. But what did you mean when you said it's all just marketing? In the real world, stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, all of that means squat. But I thought you just said it's like power tears. Yeah, it is, but it's really only Helpful if you know the platform, say we toss the stage 2 tune on the Civic Si and we go and race a stage 1 version of these. I don't know.

You got money for bags, bro? Why did you make me pay for lunch today? So I can save it for the bags. This guy. Well, it all depends on what you're gonna use your car for. Well, I would love to take it to the track, but at the same time, I also wanted to be a show car, which is why I really want bags. Well, there are some time attack cars that run bags. Let's just toss everything out and weigh out the options. Coils are cheaper, and if you go with the solid brand, they're gonna be a lot sturdier. You'll never have to worry about popping a coil. Sure, over time they can leak, but if hard driving is what you wanna do and you don't wanna worry about popping something, I would go coils. Hmm. Okay, okay. What about bags? Well, like I said, there are time attack cars that run bags. To be honest, modern air suspension has improved a lot, but I'd also be lying if I said there isn't a small worry in the back of my head about them popping. Have you looked in the stance cups? No. What's that? It's literally coil overs and air bags combined. The best of both worlds. Wow, for real. I think I'mma get those. Just saying. They're really expensive, but I still don't know if I wanna build my car into a track car or a Show car? Well, I'll put it to you like this. Every race car is a show car. However, not every show car is a race car. You see what I'm saying?

So 10 years later, I abandoned them and got my revenge. I was 8 when my parents brought Steven home. He was 7, skinny, and had this way of crying that made adults panic. Within a month, I was invisible. Christmas that year, I got socks. Steven got a Nintendo 64. When I asked why, my mom said, he's been through so much. You're lucky you've always had us. I stopped asking after that. By the time I turned 13, the pattern was clear. Steven wanted pizza, we got pizza. I wanted Chinese. We already decided on pizza. My birthday parties got smaller every year until they stopped happening entirely. His got bigger. At 14, I made honor roll. Straight A's for the first time. I showed my parents the certificate, hands shaking with pride. My mom glanced at it, that's nice, sweetie, then turned to Steven, did you finish your homework? Steven was failing three classes. That same week, they bought him a four hundred dollar guitar because he said he might want to learn. It sat in the corner untouched for two years. When I asked for a twenty dollar calculator for math class, my dad said we couldn't afford it. I started stealing quarters from the couch to buy my own school supplies. The final straw came at 16. My parents planned a party at my favorite arcade. First time they've done anything for me in years. I Invited 12 friends. Spent weeks hyped. Three days before I overheard Steven on the phone. Yeah, just throw a fit the day before. They always cave. Then it'll be my part party, and he'll look like an idiot in front of his friends. He knew I was listening. He smiled at me. Day of, Steven threw his tantrum. Right on schedule. Said he wanted to go to the same arcade for his birthday next month. My parents caved. We'll celebrate you both today. Steven already cleared it with you, right? I hadn't even spoken to Steven that week. When I said no, my dad pulled me aside. Stop being selfish. He's fragile. You're not. They brought out one cake. Vanilla. Steven's favorite. I'm allergic to vanilla. I watched my friends eat my birthday cake while I sat in the corner with hives breaking out on my neck. Steven blew out the candles, made a wish, smiled at me. That night, I found out why they really adopted him. I wasn't supposed to see the letter, but it was sitting on my dad's desk.

And make sure everything is perfect this time, my husband added. I smiled and said, of course. But at 3:00am, I was at the airport instead. For five years, I've been the perfect daughter in law. I cooked elaborate holiday meals, hosted family gatherings and never complained when my husband, Hudson's mother, Vivian, turned every Celebration into a performance I was expected to orchestrate alone. This year, Vivian handed me a guest list three days before Thanksgiving, 32 people. She'd upgraded the menu, too. Three different stuffings, seven side dishes, four desserts, all from scratch. When I mentioned it seemed like a lot for one person, she waved her hand dismissively. Nonsense. You're perfectly capable. Besides, Hudson will help. Hudson's idea of help was carving the Turkey and opening wine bottles. Maybe an hour of work total while I handled 37 hours of preparation. The breaking point came when Vivian called at 3 a. M. The night before, worried I might not properly handle a guest's severe nut allergy. She'd forgotten to mention until then three of my prepared dishes contained nuts. I have to remake everything. Start cooking at 4 a. M, she instructed. Maybe 3:30 if you want everything perfect. But something had shifted inside me. I'd spent two days in preparation hell while Hudson played golf. I'd asked him for help and he told me I was so much better at cooking than He was. I'd mentioned feeling overwhelmed and he assured me I'd pull it off like always. That night, I sat at my kitchen table staring at the guest list, 32 names. Mine wasn't on it. I was cooking for 32 people and wasn't even considered a guest. That's when I noticed Hudson's cousin Ruby wasn't listed either. I called her and discovered Vivian had uninvited her after her divorce, saying she'd be more comfortable elsewhere since she was going through such a difficult time. Ruby had been family for eight years, but the moment she needed support instead of providing entertainment value, Vivian cut her loose. I saw my own future in that moment. One bad Thanksgiving away from being discarded myself. On impulse, I opened a travel website. The first result made my heart race. Last minute Thanksgiving getaway to Hawaii. Flight departs 4:15 a. M, exactly when I was supposed to start cooking. I booked it before I can change my mind. One ticket just for me. For the first time in five years, I was going somewhere Hudson hadn't approved of, somewhere Vivian hadn't vetted.

His domestic partner is also there. Everything is fine. And then suddenly a piece of jewelry went missing and they allegedly blamed the 16 year old. That is when the two of them tortured this girl for at least 4 days, ending her life with a billiard ball down her throat over jewelry. His name is Steven Grass. He is 35. And she is Michelle Brandis. She's 37. And most importantly, this is Miranda Corset. Miranda had been on a dating website. When she met Steve, they started talking and he invited her over to the house. Everything went fine that first day and she goes back home. She had been living with her grandmother because both of her parents have passed away and she also has an 11 month old baby. So the following day she decides to go back over to their home and she never came home. And unfortunately, because she has frequently just left and not came back, the grandma didn't report it because she assumed she just went off again, which is honestly so awful in itself. So she then goes back. She's at their home. That's when the jewelry goes missing. That's when they torture her. That's when they take her life. And then the two of them dismember her and throw her in a freaking trash can. Right now the police believe that her Body is in a landfill because of her history. This is not taken seriously. I don't understand how anyone could do this to anyone for literally any reason. As of now, they are charged and they are sitting in a jail cell. And I hope Miranda receives justice. And I am begging every teenager, learn from her mistake that she did not get the chance to learn from.
