Mom's eating breakfast scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading life 3 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work part time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest. She says if we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear. Which sounds like something a dictator would say, but whatever. She makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realise immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3 60 doesn't just show where you are. It shows your speed when driving, your phone battery, and sends notifications for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect! Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she's shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is. Men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realise she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom check your location while I'm at school. Dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realise she's literally sitting. They're refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day 3 mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 in a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see. Shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses the client. Client worth $2,000. Week two she sees I stopped at McDonald's for three minutes and lectures me about wasting money. Which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for four hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and ask her four hours at one store and mom glares at me like I should have warned her he was checking but how can I when she's watching my every move? She Used to text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until eleven PM. Dad mentions that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough. But I've been to that clinic. They close at 6. That night, dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits, and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives, marked Final Notice, and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that. And mom says, processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location pins on the map. Week 5, and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the medical plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11:00am, and it's now six PM. I tell my manager I'm sick and drive over. Dad's already there in the parking lot, looking at life. Three 60, zoomed in.

A few weeks ago, my best friend, Courtney, called me sobbing. I lost my baby Kate exactly 10 weeks ago. My stomach dropped. Courtney had miscarried four times now, all at precisely 10 weeks. I'm a nurse practitioner. That timing pattern doesn't occur naturally. I drove straight to her house where her husband, Joe answered looking exhausted. She's resting. This one hit her hard. I need to see her maybe tomorrow. Joe, I'm her best friend and I'm a nurse. Let me help. He reluctantly let me in. Courtney was in bed, pale. And when I hugged her, I noticed bruising on her inner arm, fresh needle marks, multiple injection sites. Courtney, these marks. She looked confused. I don't remember getting any shots. I just, I woke up with them after I blacked out last night. You blacked out? Joe interrupted us from the doorway. She faints sometimes, stress from the pregnancy. Three days later, Courtney was feeling better and we met for coffee. I've been thinking, she said. I never actually saw my regular OBGYN during any of my pregnancies. Joe always said he found better specialists. That seemed wrong. Doctor Holly, you've seen her for years. Joe said she was too busy. He'd take me to appointments, but I'd always feel so drowsy in the waiting room. He'd go in to talk to the doctor. While I rested in the car, I called Doctor Holly's office. That afternoon, pretending to be Courtney, checking on my records. I need to verify my appointment history for insurance. It's Roberts. Our records show you called to transfer your care elsewhere last year and the year before, always after positive pregnancy tests. That evening, Courtney texted me again. Found something weird. Joe keeps the detailed calendar in his phone. It has all my periods marked and there are red X's. Exactly 14 days after each period starts. Going back three years, 14 days after period starts is ovulation peak fertility. Courtney, does anything happen on the red X days? She thought about it. Around then is when Joe makes me tea. I guess he says it's good for sleep and fertility. I always take it because I'm usually tired and we want to start a family. I was so suspicious that the next day I came over the next day while Joe was at work. That's when Courtney showed me something else. I found this tiny safe in his closet, like the kind doctors use for medications, but it's locked. We tried every code we could think of, but nothing worked. Courtney think those nights he gives you the tea. What happens after she went pale? I always wake up feeling sore down there, Joe says. We tried for a baby, but I never remember it. My stomach turned. He was drugging her and assaulting her on her fertile days to get her pregnant. Oh, my god. Could the miscarriages Be him, she shot out. I thought back to my medical training. Courtney, does anything weird happen before each miscarriage? Any sort of pattern? She thought about it for a while. Now that I think about it, I get really sick days before. For each one, way more sick than usual. Her eyes went wide. Joe makes me soup, some special recipe he says helps with morning sickness. Every single time. Every time she yelled. He's insistent I eat it all. We went back to the safe. Courtney remembered something. His ex girlfriend's name was Marie. Her birthday was October 15th. The safe clicked open. Inside were vials of medications, two types, one labeled with a fertility drug code, the other.

We'll make your sister pay. She'll never say no to family. I froze with the grocery bags in my hands. Through the kitchen window, I could see them all sitting around the table, Mom, Dad and my brother Landon. Harper's got that new job, dad was saying, making good money now. We'll just tell her it's for Mom's surgery. Mom nodded. She gave us 12,000 for the roof last year, no questions asked. My stomach dropped. There was no roof repair. I'd seen the receipts myself. They'd used my money for Landon's gambling debts. How much this time, mom asked. 50,000, Landon said casually, maybe 60 if we play it right. Tell her the cancer came back. Cancer. They were going to fake cancer to steal from me. I backed away slowly, my mind racing. The cancer scare from two years ago, the one that made me liquidate my retirement fund to pay for experimental treatments. Had that been fake, too? I thought about all the times I'd help. The car accident that wasn't covered by insurance, Landon's business that needed start up capital, Mom's dental work, Dad's back surgery, $57,000 over five years, all because I thought I was being a good daughter. Every family gathering they praise me for being so generous. Behind my back, they were laughing at how easy I was to manipulate. I got In my car and drove straight to the bank. I'd like to close all my accounts, I told the teller. All of them, miss every single one. And I need cashiers checks for the full amounts, documentation of every transaction I've made to these three people over the past five years. That evening, Landon called right on schedule. Hey, sis, can you come over tomorrow? Mom has some news about her health. His voice had that practiced concern, the same tone he'd used for every fake emergency. Sure, I said sweetly. I'll bring the whole family something special. I spent that night making copies of everything, bank statements, medical records I'd helped to pay for, receipts from Landon's failed ventures, five years of financial manipulation, all documented. The next day I walked into the.

All her friends are calling me Coffee Guy and telling me detailed stories about how much happier Emma's been since I started dating her. I didn't have the heart to correct them when they're all so genuinely grateful. Her best friend, Sarah, pulled me aside and whispered, I don't know what magic you worked, but Emma's been like a completely different person. She actually laughs at our jokes now instead of just forcing smiles. The breaking point came when Emma finally got promoted to ship supervisor after months of anxiety about applying for the position. She wanted to celebrate at some fancy Italian restaurant downtown that she'd been saving up for. I honestly couldn't have done this without our Tuesday tradition, she said, tears streaming down her face. You've been my anchor when everything felt completely impossible. You showed me that I deserve good things happening to me randomly. I don't know how to properly thank you for saving my life. I realized I wasn't just bringing coffee anymore. I was accidentally someone's primary emotional support system and the foundation of their mental health recovery. Emma's therapist had apparently told her that having consistent, positive social interactions was absolutely crucial for her healing process. And somehow I'd become that irreplaceable person in her life. Now I'm four months deep into being someone's weekly lifeline because I couldn't handle 30 seconds of social awkwardness at a coffee Counter like a normal human being. Emma just texted me a three paragraph essay about how excited she is for me to meet her parents this weekend. They're flying in from Cincinnati specifically to meet the Coffee Angel who changed their daughter's life completely and helped her find herself again after losing hope. Her dad, Richard, apparently wants to take me golfing on Sunday morning to properly thank the young man who brought our Emma back to us when we thought we'd lost her forever. Her mom has been cooking my favorite meal all week, except Emma made up what my favorite food was because she was too embarrassed to admit she didn't actually know me that well. I'm completely trapped in being someone's accidental hero over a misheard you too that spiraled into becoming the most important person in a stranger's mental health journey and recovery process. The worst part, I actually look forward to Tuesdays now, too. And I think I'm falling for someone who's in love with a version of me that doesn't really exist.

I panicked and blurted out, I said, I'll bring you coffee too sometime. She lit up with this huge smile and said, oh my god, that's really sweet. What's your name? Now I'm committed to this insane promise. Came back the next Tuesday with a venti caramel macchiato. Her name tag said Emma. She was so genuinely happy. She teared up a little and gave me her number saying text me so I know this actually happened. I figured I'd send one polite text and let it naturally fade away. But Emma started texting me paragraphs about her terrible shift, her nightmare roommate Stephanie, who never cleaned dishes and left rotting food everywhere, how my random gesture of kindness completely made her weak and gave her hope that good people still exist. I felt genuinely bad for her situation. So I kept responding with supportive messages and stupid memes to cheer her up. Three weeks later, I'm bringing Emma coffee every Tuesday at exact like two forty seven PM during her break. She starts calling me her coffee angel and introducing me to her coworkers as the sweetest guy who randomly brings me coffee For absolutely no reason except pure kindness. The whole coffee shop thinks we're dating. Her manager keeps asking when I'm going to officially ask her out. I'm too deep to correct anyone now. Then her mom visited from Ohio for Emma's birthday weekend. Emma insisted I meet her, saying I was the thoughtful one who brightens her Tuesdays when everything else in life feels overwhelming. Her mom grabbed me in this bone crushing hug and whispered, you're exactly what Emma needs right now, sweetheart. She talks about you constantly. That's when I Learned Emma had been struggling with severe anxiety and panic attacks for two years. Our Tuesday coffee ritual was literally the only consistent positive thing in her week that she could count on. She'd started scheduling her therapy appointments around our meetups because they gave her something concrete to look forward to during her darkest moments. By.

Within a week, his entire family moved three states away, ghosted me, blocked me, vanished like a coward in a Letterman jacket. But I wasn't going to be a statistic. My parents were furious, but weirdly supportive. They helped me finish high school online, and I gave birth to my son, Tommy, over Christmas break with Jingle Bells playing in the background. Cute, right? Tommy and I basically grew up together. I worked three jobs while getting my nursing degree. Mom watched him when she could. We ate so much ramen that he thought it was a food group. We lived in a tiny shoebox apartment with a couch I bought off Craigslist for $15 and dreams duct taped together. But it worked. By the time Tommy was 10, I was a pediatric ICU nurse, and he was this funny, smart, ridiculous little human who made life fun even on two hours of sleep. Then I met Daniel. Daniel's a pediatric surgeon. Smart, kind. Didn't blink when I told him I had a ten year old. On our third date, Tommy had a cold, and Daniel brought over soup and comic books. I think I fell in love. Right then, two years later, we got married and Daniel adopted Tommy. Tommy calls him dad like he Was born to. Because, honestly, he kind of was. We had twin girls three years ago, and Tommy is the sweetest big brother. Straight A student. Star pitcher for his high school, and I mean, star college. Scouts come to see him. Then last month, his team made it to the state championships. I was screaming my lungs out from the bleachers, phone in hand, filming every pitch like a full blown stage mom. That's when I saw Jake. Same face, just older. He was staring at Tommy like he was.

I said cancel the entire wedding. The call came Tuesday morning while I was editing a commercial in my home studio. This is Renee from Perfect Day Planning calling about Jared's wedding next month. Her voice sounded uncomfortable. I have some difficult news. Your family contacted us yesterday and asked us to remove you from the guest list entirely. They mentioned some family disagreements and said you wouldn't be welcome at the ceremony or reception. I paused my editing software. My family still sees me as the 29 year old college dropout who threw his life away to become a freelance videographer. What they don't know is what I actually do with all that video equipment filling my garage. However, Renee continued nervously. They also specifically requested to keep the fifty thousand dollar deposit you paid for the wedding photography package. Mrs. Ruth said the family had already allocated those funds to other wedding expenses and couldn't possibly return them. I leaned back in my chair looking at the wall of awards behind me, Emmy nominations, industry recognition, contracts with Fortune 500 company. My little video hobby had quietly become a 15 million dollar production company over the past eight years. Renee, I need to ask you something important. What's the name of your wedding venue? The Riverside Manor downtown. And who owns that property? I heard papers shuffling on Her end. Um, it's listed under Sunset Holdings LLC. Right. What about your catering company? Golden Plate Catering Services, also owned by longer pause Sunset Holdings LLC as well. Wait, what's going on here? The photography studio handling the wedding photos, Elite Moment Studio. Oh my god. That's also Sunset Holdings. The florist providing all the arrangements, Bella's Garden Creations. That's, that's you too, isn't it? The DJ company, the luxury transportation service, the rehearsal dinner venue, even the hotel block for out of town guests, all owned by Sunset Holdings LLC, which is my company. Renee's voice went up an octave. Mr Ruth, are you telling me that you own every single vendor for this wedding? I'm telling you that for the past eight months I've been secretly funding my brother's entire dream wedding through shell companies. I created every vendor, every service, every single detail of this wedding, all paid for by me through different LLCs so my family wouldn't know their disappointment son was actually footing the entire Bill for everything. This can't be happening. When I dropped out of film school 7 years ago, my parents told everyone I was throwing my life away. While they focused on Jared's safe marketing career at his corporate job, I was quietly building a production empire. Corporate videos, national commercials, award winning document energies. I work with Netflix, HBO, major advertising agencies. But to my family, I'm still just a failure who plays with cameras. Sir, what exactly are You saying? I'm saying cancel everything. The venue rental, catering contract, floral arrangements, photography package, DJ services, transportation, all of it. Every single contract goes through companies I own. the wedding is in three weeks. There are.

What did you learn? My college girlfriend's family owned half the restaurants in our city. Their house had more bathrooms than my apartment building had units. The first time I went to dinner there, I counted three different forks at my place. Setting in panic, her dad, Mr Richardson, made it clear from day one that I wasn't good enough for his daughter. What does your father do? He asked. During that first dinner, when I said he was a mechanic, the temperature in the room dropped 10 degrees. For months, I tried to fit in. I bought clothes I couldn't afford, Learned about wine I'd never drink again, and pretended to understand their conversations about vacation homes and stock portfolios. I was drowning in debt just trying to keep up with their lifestyle. The breaking point came at Sarah's birthday party. Her parents threw this massive event at their country club. I showed up in my one good suit, feeling like a fraud among all the designer everything. Mr Richardson introduced me to his friends as Sarah's little project. That's when I snapped. I stopped trying to impress them. I started being myself again. The guy who worked two jobs, ate ramen for dinner and fixed his own car if they didn't like it. Tough. The weird thing, Sarah's younger brother, Marcus, started hanging around me more. He was 16, rebellious and clearly tired of his family's expectations while everyone else was Networking and name dropping, Marcus and I would sneak off to play video games in his room. One night, Marcus asked if I could teach him to change his car's oil. Dad just pays people to do everything, he said. I wanna actually know how stuff works. So we spent the weekend in my tiny garage getting our hands dirty and talking about real life. A few weeks later, Mr Richardson called me, not Sarah, me directly.

He'd gotten it sewn on over the weekend. The guy had never LED soldiers in combat, never made a life or death decision. But he had that piece of paper that said he took online quizzes about psychology and business management. During the promotion ceremony, the battalion commander gave a speech about the importance of professional development and lifelong learning. I stood in the back watching Marcus shake hands with officers while photographers took pictures. That night, I enrolled in three online classes, American history, college algebra and some business course. I'd finish my associate's degree in six months, even if it meant staying up until midnight after 12 hour duty days. But here's what really bothered me. Two months later, our battalion got deployment orders to Syria. Marcus, the newly promoted sergeant 1st class, immediately went to the chaplain claiming family hardship to avoid going. Meanwhile, I deployed for my fourth combat tour, leading the same soldiers I'd always LED without the rank or pay that should have come with it. Six months into the deployment, 1st sergeant Granger called me into his office. We were at a small base outside Rocca. Jake, Marcus just got chaptered out for failing back to back PT tests. The E7 slot open back up. I pushed your packet through as a battlefield promotion. You finished that degree? Yes. Top turned in my final exam last week from the base internet cafe. Good. You're getting your stripes, but you're not getting them because of the degree then why? Because when mortar started hitting the space last month, Marcus's college education didn't mean anything. your 12 years of experience kept 20 soldiers alive during that attack. That's worth more than any diploma I made sergeant first class right there in Syria in a combat zone, the way it should have happened in the first place. The degree was just a box I had to check. Marcus is working at a car dealership now. I'm still here leading soldiers, except now I finally have the rank that matches the job I've been doing all along.

I was a staff sergeant with 12 years in the army. Two combat deployments to Afghanistan, one to Iraq. I had an Army Commendation Medal with valor, a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart from when an IED flipped our vehicle outside Kandahar. I've been running my platoons operations for three years while my platoon sergeant was deployed elsewhere. Everyone assumed I'd make sergeant First class in the next promotion cycle. I had perfect evaluation reports, expert marksmanship badges, and my soldiers actually respected me. Then the promotion board results came out on a Friday afternoon. My name wasn't on the list. I walked into 1st sergeant Granger's office confused. Top. Can I ask what happened with my E7 packet? I thought I had a solid chance. He looked uncomfortable, pulled out my file and spread it across his desk. Jake, you had the highest tactical scores of anyone who applied. Your combat evaluations are outstanding. Your platoon has the best readiness numbers in the battalion. So what happened? He pointed to a single line on the scoring sheet. Education points. You needed a minimum of 15. You have eight. I stared at him. I have two years of community college credits. That's not enough. The new policy requires an associates degree minimum for E7. Your three classes short. Meanwhile, specialist Marcus Lee just finished his bachelor's degree online. He's only been in four years. Never deployed, but he got max points in the education category. Marcus supply clerk who failed his last PT test. First sergeant nodded. He passed the promotion board. You didn't. The math doesn't lie. I felt my face getting hot. So 12 years of service, three combat tours, and actual combat medals mean less than college classes about English literature? Jake, I don't make the rules. I'm just telling you what the board saw. I went home that weekend and told my wife, Emily. She been planning on me making sergeant first class because it came with a pay raise we desperately needed. Our second kid was due in three months. Can you appeal it? She asked. No. The scoring system is the scoring system. Monday morning, I showed up to form a

So I crawled under the kitchen table with Buster, our old golden retriever, and wrap my arms around him. He was shaking just as bad as I was. That's when it really hit me. If that tornado came through our neighborhood, my parents weren't going to open that door for me. They'd rather save their stupid photo albums than make sure their own daughter was safe. The storm lasted about 20 minutes, but it felt like hours. When the sirens finally stopped and the wind died down, I heard the basement door creek open. Mom and dad came upstairs looking all annoyed like the whole thing had just been a big inconvenience. You should have knocked harder, mom said, when she saw me still under the table. You could have been hurt if you came down with all that stuff, dad added, gesturing to their precious boxes. You'll thank us one day when we still have the photo albums. I'm finished. But I didn't thank them. Not that night, not ever. The next week at school, Missus Coleman asked our class to talk about emergency preparedness. What's something you'd grab in an emergency? She wanted to know. Kids raised their hands with all the normal answers. Jamie said she'd grab her baby brother. Tyler said his cat. Lisa said her parents. I didn't raise my hand. I just sat there thinking about how I wouldn't grab anything at all because when it really mattered, I Learned that in my Family. I was on my own. Three months later, I told my guidance counselor what happened that night. She made some phone calls and suddenly there were people asking me and my parents lots of questions. Turns out leaving your 12 year old daughter alone upstairs during a tornado warning while you hide in the basement isn't considered good parenting. Dad lost his custody rights six weeks after that. Mom kept making excuses about how there really wasn't enough room downstairs. But the judge wasn't buying it.

I was 12 when a tornado warning Siren went off at 2:00am. Most kids never think about what their parents would actually do in a real emergency until it happens. I found out the hard way. The sirens were screaming outside our house and I could hear the wind picking up something fierce. I'd done tornado drills at school a million times. Teacher always said the same thing. Have a plan. With your family, nowhere to go, stick together. So when I heard that awful wailing sound, I did exactly what I was supposed to do. I ran straight to my parents bedroom, heart pounding in my chest. The door was already open and mom was frantically pulling clothes out of dresser drawers while dad grabbed boxes from under the bed. Grab the photo albums! Mom shouted at him, pointing to the bookshelf. What about me? I asked, standing there in my pajamas with my hair all messy from sleep. Neither one of them even looked at me. Dad rushed past me carrying our old wedding albums and some jewelry boxes. Mom was right behind him with her arms full of important papers and more pictures. I followed them downstairs, my bare feet cold on the hardwood floor. I could hear the thunder getting louder outside, and the rain was starting to hammer against the windows. The emergency radio was crackling with warnings about rotation. Spotted just a few miles away. When We got to the basement door. Mom turned around and saw me standing there. There's no more room, she snapped. I was asking for something unreasonable. Then they shut the door right in my face. I stood there in that dark hallway alone while the whole house shook from thunder. The sirens kept wailing, and I could hear the wind outside getting stronger and stronger. It sounded like a freight train was coming straight for us. I tried knocking on the basement door, but they didn't answer. I called for them, but not

My husband's friend Kate always had to be the main character in every situation. When someone else had good news, Kate suddenly had better news. At group dinners, she'd hijack any conversation within five minutes. I couldn't stand her, but I put up with it because she and Zach had been friends since college. After my husband and I announced our pregnancy at 12 weeks, things with Kate got really weird. Suddenly, Kate was everywhere we went sporting a small baby bump. She showed up at our favorite brunch spot rubbing her belly. She enrolled in our exact prenatal yoga class. She even switched to our OB practice. Nobody questioned it because these things happen, and women get pregnant at the same time. She posted weekly bump photos on Instagram, and everyone congratulated her just like they did me. Three months in, one of our friends mentioned something strange at a girls night. She said Kate's belly looked bigger a previous Tuesday at book club than it did at Saturday's barbecue. When she brought it up, Kate burst into tears about how cruel it was to comment on a pregnant woman's body. She went on about water retention and bloating and how pregnant women deal with enough judgment without their friends piling on. Our friend felt terrible and apologized profusely while the rest of us comforted Kate. After that night, nobody dared mention anything about her appearance again. Even though I Started noticing her bump size seemed to fluctuate, too. That's when things got uncomfortable. Kate started making comments about how wild it was that we got pregnant around the same time. She'd joke about our babies being best friends, maybe even more than friends someday. Then the jokes got stranger, like when she said Pregnancy Brain made her forget exactly when she conceived. And wasn't it funny how close our due dates were? She started showing up at every single appointment Zach and I had. Always in the waiting room when we arrived, claiming her appointment was right before or after hours. During our maternity photo shoot at the park, she appeared with her own photographer, saying what a coincidence that she'd booked the same spot. The photographer later told me Kate had called asking what time we'd be there. Everything exploded at my baby shower. My sister threw this beautiful garden party with all our family and friends there to celebrate. Halfway through opening gifts, Kate stood up and clinked her glass to make an announcement. With tears streaming down her face, she placed her hand on her belly and said, I have the most wonderful news to share with everyone. Zack and I are having a baby together! The entire party gasped, and she continued with a huge smile, I know this is unconventional, but isn't it beautiful that our babies will be siblings?

I storm through the glass doors like John Wick but Hornier who took away my Stranger Things? I screamed. Some poor intern tried to stop me.

I grabbed one of them by the collar and fricked with no mercy it department fucked. I changed their Wi-Fi password to I love fanboy 67. By the time I reached the CEO's office, security had gathered. Employees were Panicking, alarms were blaring and someone was live streaming the whole thing on TikTok. I slammed my hands on the CEO's desk and said, voice trembling, renew my subscription or face the Baka. The man blinked, looked at me and whispered, sir, you could have just used the free trial. I saw red after that. Once I finished, the CEO started gasping for air.

I always had this weird feeling about my Uncle Pete. Like, everyone in my family absolutely loved the guy. He was the fun uncle. You know, the one who'd show up to family barbecues with his loud laugh and those expensive gifts that made all us kids go crazy. He take us out for burgers, let us play games on his phone for hours. And somehow he always knew all the latest slang before we did. But something about Pete just felt off to me. Maybe it was how he'd always squeeze into your personal space when he talked to you, standing way too close. Or how he always wanted to be alone with one of us kids, saying stuff like, let the grown UPS talk and pulling us into another room. My parents thought it was sweet that he wanted to spend time with us. I was 16 when my little cousin Emily started acting different. Emily was always this bubbly kid who asked a million questions and made everyone laugh with her silly jokes. But suddenly she got quiet. Like, really quiet. She stopped joking around completely. Stopped asking her usual why this and why that questions. When I'd ask her what was wrong, she'd just shrug and say she was tired. That wasn't Emily at all. One Saturday, I was helping my dad clean out the garage. We were sorting through old tools and junk when I saw this spare Key hanging on a little hook. It had a label that said Pete in my dad's handwriting. That made zero sense to me. Pete didn't live with us. He had his own apartment across town. Why would he need a key to our house? I asked my dad about it. He just chuckled and said Pete probably made a copy years ago when they used to share tools back and forth. You know how your uncle is always borrowing something dad said. But something about that explanation felt wrong. Pete hadn't borrowed tools in years. That night I couldn't sleep. Something about that key kept bugging me. Why would Pete still need access to our house? Why was the key hanging in the garage where everyone could see it? The more I thought about it, the weirder it seemed. The next day, I decided to fake being sick and stay home from school. I told my mom I had a headache and she believed me. After everyone left for work and school, I just waited. I had this gut feeling that something was going to happen. Around two forty five PM, right before Emily usually walked home from school and stopped by our house to wait for her mom to pick her up, I heard the garage door open, but nobody was supposed to be home. I looked out the window and saw Pete's blue Honda pulling into our driveway. My heart started pounding. Pete walked straight into the garage. Like he owned the place. Grab that key and let himself into the house through the side door. He didn't even knock or call out to see if anyone was home. He just walked right in. I followed him from upstairs, trying to be as quiet as possible. He went straight to the downstairs guest room, where Emily usually waited. When she came over, Pete looked around. Then

But her face immediately dropped when she realised that we tricked her. My sister in law Maya, has always been competitive with me, since the day I married her brother Jake. She couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me, and from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd deplete, she'd push harder, come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nursery and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail. When she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages, desperately searching for any evidence of Our name decision. My husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use it first. She wouldn't do that, he said. But I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created bacon interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with final decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. And Maya came over for dinner. I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition. And I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think? She'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labour. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived! The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction. To her surprise, The next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness. When I walked into her room, she actually had the audacity to say, I hope you don't mind that we ended up using Aurora when she was born. It just felt so right for our daughter. I know you guys were considering it, too. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed her our real pic.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We'd known each other since freshman year, and when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything fifty fifty, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back, thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird, serious face. He starts with. So I've been thinking, and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time, I cleaned up after myself, and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. But she's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue, because, honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I tell her, fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved, like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything, and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realise I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine. The leather couch we're always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day. I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff, like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the TV and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target, and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. I'm walking out with it. I realised she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that really made me laugh. When I was packing up the kitchen stuff, I realised I'd bought all the cooking supplies too. The pans, the good knife set, even the can opener. I left her with basically nothing except a mini fridge and some random cups she had from high school. By the time I finished loading everything, the apartment looked like nobody had ever lived there. Just empty rooms with

The bride stopped mid pose. Her photographer looked confused and about 30 wedding guests turned to stare at my three year old daughter Emma standing by the playground swings. I was mortified. Emma had this habit of saying random things loudly at the worst possible moments, but this was next level embarrassing. Emma, honey, let's go play on the slides, I whispered, trying to drag her away from the wedding party, but she wasn't having it. She broke free from my grip and marched right up to the bride, tugging on her dress. Lady, don't marry the mean man, Emma said, pointing directly at the groom. He's gonna hurt you. Everyone went dead silent. The groom's face went red and he started walking toward us looking angry. Hey, what kind of kid says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just 3 and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve. My mommy had marks like that when the bad man lived with us. She cried at night, too, just like you smell like tears under your makeup. My heart stopped. This kid had been through way too much for her age, but she developed This weird ability to spot things adults tried to hide. When my ex was still around, Emma would always know when I'd been crying, even if I thought I'd covered it up perfectly.

I care about my teenage boy, but I'd be dishonest if I said I wasn't let down by the kind of person he's becoming. My son began getting into this different look back when he was in middle school. At first he just wore black clothes, but once he got to high school, he's gone way too far with his strange style and I really don't like it. My wife doesn't seem to mind, but she's a pretty passive woman and has never been a very strict parent like me. If I were to describe how my son dresses now, he wears big, baggy black clothing and lots of chains and rings. At one point, he was even dying coloured strips into his hair. I remember being so upset the first day I saw this. It was just so embarrassing to see my child walking around like that. Now, I don't have a problem with gay people or anything like that, but I never really wanted that type of thing to be a part of my own household. I've never confronted my son about his sexuality and I really just don't wanna know if he does happen to be. Our relationship is already sort of strained and I feel like if I found out he wasn't straight, it would make it very hard for me to treat him the same. Like I said, I don't have a problem with gay people. I just don't wanna be shoved in my face on top of everything. Ever since my son entered high school, he's made friends with mostly girls. At first I was glad to see this, and I was happy that my son still might have a chance of growing up into a real man's man. But as time went on, I realized that he wasn't in a relationship with any of these girls dead. They were all just his close friends. He constantly has his friends over the house and is part of a friend group with three other girls. To be fair, these girls have always been nothing but polite to me and my wife and are always respectful of our house. Still, it just rubs me the wrong way that my son doesn't seem to have any close guy friends. And I feel like it's not good for him to grow up that way. I tried my best to be non judgmental towards my son, even though to me he looked like more of a freak of nature. Every day the more he kept leaning into his alternative fashion. I didn't understand it, since all of his friends were normal girls. He was the only weirdo in his friend group who dressed like some 90s mall rat. When I look at him, he honestly reminds me of the kind of kids I would pick on in high school. Anyway, about a Year ago, I ran out of patience with him when he came home one day with his nails painted a shade of bright blue. My son had never done anything like this before, and I couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly disgusted. I told him that he had gone too far with his emo bullshit and that I couldn't continue letting him make a fool out of himself like this. I told him that at one point he needed to become a man, and painting his nails made him look like some sort of weak top. My son and I had never really been close. We didn't even speak that often, so he looked very hurt as I was telling him all this. But I couldn't help it. He had needed a reality check for so long and there was no avoiding this conversation. I told my son to go get nail polish remover and remove his nail polish right there in front of me. That's when he started to get angry and said that he didn't have to change himself just to appease my dumb, homophobic son. My son has never spoken to either of his parents this way, and I knew that there was no way I was letting him get away with it. I yelled at him for cursing at me like that, and I told him that he would remove his nail polish immediately or there would be serious consequences. He said that there was nothing worse. I could do to him than continue being such a hateful father. And that's when I lost my shot. I told him that I would ground him for the entire year if he didn't remove his nail polish within the next 60 seconds. Looked at me and told me that I could try, but I would never be able to control him and that he hated me. He ran up to his room after this, and I followed through on my threat. I took his phone away and replaced it with a flip phone, and he wasn't allowed to go out or have his friends over anymore. All he did after that for the rest of the year was call his friends in his room and completely ignore me. One night, I overheard him crying to my wife about how much he hated his life since being grounded. But all she said was that I was his father and he needed to respect me. Proud of my wife for sticking up to me behind closed doors. And I still felt like I had made the right decision. I won't lie and say that it hasn't been a difficult year. My son stopped talking to me the day I grounded him, and I honestly do miss him. He graduates next year, and I just hope before then he'll realise that I was only ever trying to do what was best for him.

My son has never spoken to either of his parents this way, and I knew that there was no way I was letting him get away with it. I yelled at him for cursing at me like that, and I told him that he would remove his nail polish immediately or there would be serious consequences. He said that there was nothing worse. I could do to him than continue being such a hateful father. And that's when I lost my shot. I told him that I would ground him for the entire year if he didn't remove his nail polish within the next 60 seconds. Looked at me and told me that I could try, but I would never be able to control him and that he hated me. He ran up to his room after this, and I followed through on my threat. I took his phone away and replaced it with a flip phone, and he wasn't allowed to go out or have his friends over anymore. All he did after that for the rest of the year was call his friends in his room and completely ignore me. One night, I overheard him crying to my wife about how much he hated his life since being grounded. But all she said was that I was his father and he needed to respect me. Proud of my wife for sticking up to me behind closed doors. And I still felt like I had made the right decision. I won't lie and say that it hasn't been a difficult year. My son stopped talking to me the day I grounded him, and I honestly do miss him. He graduates next year, and I just hope before then he'll realise that I was only ever trying to do what was best for him.

I care about my teenage boy, but I'd be dishonest if I said I wasn't let down by the kind of person he's becoming. My son began getting into this different look back when he was in middle school. At first he just wore black clothes, but once he got to high school, he's gone way too far with his strange style and I really don't like it. My wife doesn't seem to mind, but she's a pretty passive woman and has never been a very strict parent like me. If I were to describe how my son dresses now, he wears big, baggy black clothing and lots of chains and rings. At one point, he was even dying coloured strips into his hair. I remember being so upset the first day I saw this. It was just so embarrassing to see my child walking around like that. Now, I don't have a problem with gay people or anything like that, but I never really wanted that type of thing to be a part of my own household. I've never confronted my son about his sexuality and I really just don't wanna know if he does happen to be. Our relationship is already sort of strained and I feel like if I found out he wasn't straight, it would make it very hard for me to treat him the same. Like I said, I don't have a problem with gay people. I just don't wanna be shoved in my face on top of everything. Ever since my son entered high school, he's made friends with mostly girls. At first I was glad to see this, and I was happy that my son still might have a chance of growing up into a real man's man. But as time went on, I realised that he wasn't in a relationship with any of these girls dead. They were all just his close friends. He constantly has his friends over the house and is part of a friend group with three other girls. To be fair, these girls have always been nothing but polite to me and my wife and are always respectful of our house. Still, it just rubs me the wrong way that my son doesn't seem to have any close guy friends, and I feel like it's not good for him to grow up that way. I tried my best to be non judgmental towards my son, even though to me he looked like more of a freak of nature. Every day the more he kept leaning into his alternative fashion. I didn't understand it, since all of his friends were normal girls. He was the only weirdo in his friend group who dressed like some 90s mall rat. When I look at him, he honestly reminds me of the kind of kids I would pick on in high school. Anyway, about a Year ago, I ran out of patience with him when he came home one day with his nails painted a shade of bright blue. My son had never done anything like this before, and I couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly disgusted. I. I told him that he had gone too far with his emo bullshit and that I couldn't continue letting him make a fool out of himself like this. I told him that at one point he needed to become a man, and painting his nails made him look like some sort of weak top. My son and I had never really been close. We didn't even speak that often, so he looked very hurt as I was telling him all this. But I couldn't help it. He had needed a reality check for so long and there was no avoiding this conversation. I told my son to go get nail polish remover and remove his nail polish right there in front of me. That's when he started to get angry and said that he didn't have to change himself just to appease my dumb homophobic self. My son has never spoken to either of his parents this way, and I knew that there was no way I was letting him get away with it.

I still took her to the rooftop, got down on one knee, then pulled out her texts with her gym buddy and said loudly, actually, I'm not proposing. I'm here to say goodbye in front of everyone you tried to impress. This happened 3 weeks ago and I'm still processing it. My girlfriend Danielle and I had been together for 3 years. I've been dropping engagement hints constantly, showing me rings, talking about weddings. I've been secretly saving for months, even picked out a ring. The plan was to propose at her company's rooftop holiday party. She kept mentioning how romantic it would be with the City Lights and all her co workers there. But last Tuesday changed everything. I came home early from my hospital shift. I heard Danielle on Facetime upstairs laughing. Melissa, he's definitely doing it at the party tomorrow. He's been acting all secretive. I stopped on the stairs. That's exciting. Are you ready? Her sister asked. Here's the thing, I'm saying no right in front of everyone. My blood went cold. Danielle, what? Why? He needs a reality check. Plus, you know Anthony from Crossfit. He just started his own business. Way more ambitious than a nurse. Anthony, the guy she'd been training with three nights a week. You're really going to humiliate him at your work party? Picture this, all my co workers watching. He gets Down on one knee and I just say sorry. But no, maybe he'll understand. He can't coast through life helping sick people all day. They both giggled. I quietly went to my car and sat there for an hour. That night, Danielle was all over me. Babe, I love you so much. All I could think about was her planning my destruction. Wednesday morning, her phone buzzed with a text from Anthony. Can't wait to celebrate tomorrow. She'd left it unlocked. I scrolled through their messages. So, so tomorrow's the big day, Anthony had written. Yep, poor guy has no idea what's coming. You sure you wanna do this at work? Seems harsh. He needs this wake up call. Besides, I'll need someone to comfort me after. Always here for you. Can't wait to see his face. Weeks of messages like this. I took screenshots. That afternoon, Danielle called me bouncing with excitement. Tom, I can't wait for tonight. Everyone's going to be there. My boss, the whole team. It's going to be perfect. Perfect for my public destruction. Can't wait, I said. The party was on the 40th floor with incredible downtown views. Danielle Network introduced me as my boyfriend, Tom. He's a nurse. Like she was embarrassed. Anthony showed up around eight PM, big guy, Crossfit shirt, giving me this smug look. Around 9:30, Danielle got antsy, checking her phone constantly. The view is incredible. So romantic with these lights. It really is beautiful. Perfect setting for something. Special to happen. You're absolutely right. Could you get everyone's attention? I have something to say. Her eyes lit up. She called out everyone. Tom has something to share. The room quieted. Her boss smiled. Anthony pulled out his phone. Probably to record my humiliation. I got down.

I woke up to my teenage daughter Kayla's piercing screams. I ran into her bedroom and couldn't believe what I saw. She was completely bald, her blonde hair scattered across her pillowcase. She was sobbing, telling me her little sister Reese must have shaved her head while she was sleeping. She stumbled to the bathroom mirror and started screaming even loud when she saw her reflection. Prom was in 8 hours and she was supposed to be a shoe in for Queen. Now it was ruined. Where's Reese, I demanded. And my husband found her sitting on her own bed in her unicorn pajamas with his electric razor on her nightstand. Reese, what did you do? I asked, trying not to scream while Kayla sobbed in the bathroom. I had to stop her from going to prom, Reese said in that small voice she uses when she knows she's in trouble but thinks she did the right thing. This was my baby, who still crawled into Kayla's bed during thunderstorms. The same little girl who Kayla taught to ride a bike last summer, the one who followed her big sister everywhere, asking endless questions about everything. I couldn't believe she would sabotage her sister's big night like this. Before I could respond, the doorbell rang. Kayla's boyfriend, Steven, let himself in like he always did on Saturday mornings. He came Upstairs calling about corsage colours and stopped dead when he saw Kayla's bald head. What the hell happened to your hair, he asked and quickly rearranged his face into concern. Baby, don't cry. We can fix this. Maybe get you a nice wig. You'll still be the prettiest girl there. Kayla was crying harder now. Steven pulled her against him while glaring at me like this was my fault. Did Reese do this? I always said that kid was weird. This is assault, Missus Adams. Reese appeared in the bathroom doorway still in her unicorn pajamas. I cut off all her hair so she couldn't go to prom with you because you're mean to her, Reese, I yelled. But she kept talking in that determined little kid voice. You hurt my sister all the time, Kevin. I see the purple marks on her arms where you grabbed her too hard. The bathroom went silent. Steven laughed, but it sounded forced. Kids make up crazy stories. Missus Adams, tell her, Kayla, tell your mom how good I am to you. Kayla wouldn't look at anyone. I felt ice spreading through my chest. I took pictures on Mommy's phone. When Kayla was sleeping, Reese said, her voice getting stronger. You push her into walls. You hit her tummy where nobody can see. Then you buy her presents after so she won't tell. I pulled out my phone with shaking hands and opened my photos. There they were, close UPS of Kayla's arms. With finger shaped bruises, her ribs with dark purple marks. I felt my stomach drop. Oh, my god, I whispered. Kayla, is this true? Steven's face was getting red. Those could be from anything she plays.

The call came through my commanding officer. Your son committed felony assault at his father's wedding. You need to get home now. I was on a base in Germany and hadn't seen my boys in 8 months. Now my teenage son who stopped wrestling because he hated hurting people was facing charges for brutalizing a woman at the altar. After an 18 hour emergency flight, I, I headed to my ex husband's house where my son was. The wife's dark blood was still stained by the driveway. I rang the doorbell. My ex husband Conrad answered. His face twisted with rage. We're pressing charges. I'm not taking anyone's side until I see both, I said. Pushing past him. The living room was a tribunal. Conrad's parents on the couch, his brother Potter by the fireplace, his sister Fenn in the corner, the bride's parents standing like guard dogs. And in the center the bride Lauren with a splinted nose, two black eyes, bandages across her face. She he was crying, dabbing her eyes carefully around the swelling. And there surrounded by this mob sat my son, my 14 year old who refused to kill insects because he could have been born an ant, who taught his little stepbrother origami. He sat perfectly straight, chin raised, looking me dead in the eyes with zero regret. He looked proud of what he Did your son destroyed our family, Conrad spat. Look what he did to her face. Lauren sobbed harder. He's an animal. They're trying him as an adult, right? Grandpa shook his head in disgust. I looked at my son. His knuckles were still bruised and swollen. There seemed to be no real excuse. But then I asked for his side of the story. He looked around the room slowly taking in every face. Then he spoke. Voice clear. You wanna know the truth? She's been molesting me for 6 months. That's why I did it. My world stopped, but the room exploded instantly. Liar. Disgusting. How dare you. Lauren's face shifted for just a sec and before she wailed louder. He's making it up. I've been nothing but loving. Her mother stepped forward pointing at my son. You evil little. But her father grabbed her arm, his face pale like he'd been expecting this. In the midst of all the chaos, my son pulled out his phone and swiped to his hidden photos, she said. Fourteen year old boys always want it said. I should be grateful. I saw the images over his shoulder and my stomach turned. Conrad's hands were shaking as he stared at the screen. Those could be anyone could have, but his voice was hollow like he was reading a script. He didn't believe Lauren tried to snatch the phone. Those are out of context. I, it was just she stopped realizing. She just admitted they Were real. My son stood up, voice shaking with rage. Dad, I told you three months ago, you said she's just being affectionate. Conrad started stuttering. I didn't. I thought, Grandpa, you laughed. Lucky boy. Wish I had that problem at 14. Grandpa's face went from red to white. He looked at Lauren, then at his grandson, and something crumbled in his expression. Aunt Fenn, you told me, don't be dramatic. Fenn was backing toward the door, tears streaming. Oh, god. Oh, god. I thought you were just Uncle Potter. You said I should be grateful Potter had his head in his hands. Jesus Christ. I was joking. I didn't know she was actually grandma. You said boys can't be great by women. Grandma collapsed into the couch, rosary beads in her hands, whispering prayers. Every single one of you told me to shut up about it. Lauren's parents were having a whispered argument. Her father hissed. Not again, Patricia. You said she was better. The word again hung in the air. But that's not why I hit her. My son cut through. Everyone immediately froze. What do you.

My boyfriend Eric had this problem. He couldn't put his phone down ever. Like the guy would literally text while I was talking to him at dinner. I'd catch him scrolling Instagram in the bathroom, dming random girls on Snapchat, always saying he was just networking for his music career. We've been together almost 4 years. We lived together, shared custody of our golden retriever, Benny, even had matching coffee mugs. I thought we were solid. Sure, Eric spent way too much time on his phone, but I figured all guys our age were like that. Then one Tuesday night, he came home from work acting weird, wouldn't look at me, kept checking his phone every 5 seconds, had this stupid grin on his face. I asked what was up and he said we needed to talk. I met someone, he said, still staring at his phone. Her name is Stacy. She just gets me, you know, like we talk for hours every night about deep stuff, things you never ask me about. I was confused. What do you mean you met someone where Snapchat, but it's not like that. We have this connection. She understands my music, my dreams. She actually listens to me. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. He was dumping me for some girl he'd never met? Some random person online? Eric, that's insane. You don't even know this person. But he was already packing his stuff. Said Stacy was helping him become a better version of himself, that she believed in his potential. That I was just holding him back from his true happiness. Whole thing was so bizarre. I didn't even fight it. I just watched him stuff his clothes into trash bags like our 4 years together meant nothing. But here's the thing about Eric. He was careless with his phone. I remembered seeing this girl Snapchat handle a few weeks earlier when he left it unlocked on the counter. So after he moved out, I got curious. I made a fake account and searched for her.

My cousin Rachel just buried her husband and two kids last week. Car accident took them all at once. She's left with just her five year old daughter, Emma. And honestly, watching them at the funeral was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So my brother Jake and his wife Kelly show up to our house that morning. Before we head to the church, first thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral, and she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her, but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. The cemetery. She literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would mention How hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I know. Now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce, pregnant lady coming through or, baby on board needs to pee. There were, like, 30 people there grieving, and she's treating it like her personal pregnancy announcement party. But then she crossed the line. Rachel was sitting

Did we hide in my ex's tattoo when everyone realised how horrible he was? I was cleaning my station at the tattoo shop ready to go home when out of nowhere I heard that voice, that nauseating, too familiar laugh that used to make my heart race for all the wrong reasons. Nate, my ex, who told me I was too clingy when I caught him texting three other girls. My anxiety was exhausting. When I asked why he kept hiding his phone, I tried my best to hide myself and thankfully he just walked by. But I heard everything. Babe, matching tattoos are so cringe. How will I even know I'll still like you? The girl's voice was small but hopeful. I just thought it would be romantic, he laughed. You're lucky I even came to look with you. It's always you with your dumb woman ideas. My coworker Jacqueline's eyes met mine. She knew my history. She'd held me through the breakdown six months ago when I found out Nate had been cheating our entire two year relationship. That's when Jaclyn walked over all professional smiles and I saw that look in her eyes. She was up to something. Jaclyn started showing them designs, but after a few minutes, I watched her go back to grab her phone. 30 seconds later, I got a notification from our group chat. Remember that one idea we had? It's go time. Within minutes, our entire crew was involved. Everybody Started getting excited, but I didn't know what this idea they were talking about was. Jaclyn pulled out her tablet, showing them some thing that made the girlfriend immediately gasped. Oh, my god, it's perfect. Nate barely glanced up from his phone. Yeah, whatever makes you happy, babe. Jacqueline's face was completely professional. I saw her jaw clench, fighting something. She excused herself for a moment and practically sprinted to the back room where I was hiding. The second the door closed, she collapsed against the wall, tears streaming down her face, trying not to laugh. I can't go back out there. You have to see this design. But before she could show me, Jade burst in, mascara running. I just told them it's eternal love, sacred geometry, he said. Whatever. I'm going to pee myself. We had to take turns going back out, each of us needing breaks to compose ourselves. The girlfriend was glowing, texting her entire family pictures of the design. We were all praying none of them would notice. And by some miracle, they didn't. They decided she'd go first. Jacqueline took her to the chair while Nate waited up front. And that's when things got almost impossible. Jacqueline was doing the stencil, explaining something about special angle calculations for maximum symbolic connection. And the girlfriend was eating it up. Jacqueline's hand was shaking, not from nerves, from suppressed laughter. She had to excuse herself twice. When it was Nate's turn, our senior artist, Nick, took Over while I watched from the back with the other girls, all of us hold behind the half wall like kids watching something they shouldn't. Nate spent the entire session on Facetime with somebody talking about a girl from the gym. Yeah, bro. She's been all over my DMs. Might hit that this weekend. You feel me? His girlfriend was in the bathroom. We kept poking our heads around the corner and every time we'd see Nick's shoulders shaking. All of us still in disbelief of what his tattoo said. When both tattoos were done, they stood together, wrists touching and the girlfriend squealed. It's perfect.

I used to fake sick at least once a month. Nothing dramatic, just your classic ugh, my stomach hurts routine. I'd shuffle into the kitchen, wrap myself in a blanket, throw in a little cough, and wait for my mom to sigh and say, fine, but no video games. She always fell for it. Or maybe she just didn't care enough to argue. This time felt no different. It was a Thursday. I had a math test I wasn't ready for, and zero energy to sit through Mr. Danner's forty five minute rant about fractions, so I pulled out the old stomachache move. My mom was already halfway out the door for work, so she just nodded and left. I grabbed a bowl of cereal, flopped on to the couch, and turned on some cartoons, already feeling like I'd won. Dad works nights, so he usually sleeps through most of the day and the house stays quiet, but around 10:00 I heard his door open. I muted the TV and listened. He walked past the living room without noticing me, phone in hand, and stepped out into the garage. Didn't think much of it at first, figured maybe he was calling in sick or trying to get a refund for something. But then I heard his voice through the wall. And it wasn't his normal voice. It was quiet, tired, flat. I can't do this anymore, he said. I paused. I Tried. I really tried. But I feel like I don't even know my family anymore. I come home and everything's just cold. I tiptoed down the hall, heart suddenly racing. The garage door was cracked open, just like always, and I crouched beside it. I know this isn't what we wanted, but it's where we are now, he said. Every day I feel like I'm just pretending. Pretending to be fine. Pretending to be a good husband, a good dad. My stomach twisted. This time for real. I mean, look at him, he said. He doesn't even like me. He doesn't talk to me unless he wants something. And when he does, it's just one word. Answers. I don't even know who he is anymore. My throat went dry. I look at him and all I can think is, what happened? What did I do wrong? When did he start looking at me like I was a stranger? There was silence then. I know it's awful, but sometimes I wonder if I'd be happier alone. Just starting over. Somewhere quiet. Somewhere nobody knows me. My chest felt like it caved in. I haven't said anything to her yet, he continued. I don't even know if I will. But I can't keep going like this. I'm exhausted. I backed away from the door before I could hear more. I stumbled into the bathroom and locked the door behind me, sat on the edge of the tub and stared at the floor. He didn't know I was home. He didn't know I was listening. And he definitely didn't know I had just realized something I could never unhear. My dad didn't just feel lost. He felt lost because of me. I stayed in the bathroom for over an hour, just trying to breathe. When I finally came out, he was back in his room. I crept into mine, got under the covers, and didn't move for the rest the day. Later that night, he knocked on my door. How's your stomach? He asked. Fine. I mumbled. Need anything? No. He stood there for a second longer, then said, okay, let me know. I said nothing.

I had to choose. I'm at work on a Tuesday morning when my wife texts having contractions. Think this is it. Meet you at Memorial Hospital. I'm grabbing my car keys when my phone rings. It's my twin sister and she's sobbing. My water just broke. I'm scared. I'm headed to Valencia Hospital. Please come. I freeze in the parking lot holding the phone up to my ear. My wife is 39 weeks pregnant with our first baby. My sister is only 34 weeks, making this a high risk pregnancy. And her boyfriend left her two months ago after they found out the baby has down syndrome. The hospitals are 45 minutes apart in opposite directions. I stand there like an idiot while the two most important women in my life need me in two different places. I drive toward my sister first because she's alone and high risk. I call my wife from the car. When I tell her, she's crying but says she understands. My sister texts, contractions getting stronger. Nurse says I'm 4 cm dilated. I think back to when my sister held my hand through our dad's death when we were 16. She's been there through my depression, my divorce from my first marriage, everything. She chose me as her birth partner months ago when her boyfriend bailed. My wife texts, contractions five minutes apart now. Then I'm scared, too. Then we promised We'd do this together. My wife has an anxiety disorder and she's been planning this birth for three years. The playlist wrote letters to the baby. We practice breathing exercises every night. I'm driving when my breathing starts coming in faster and my hands are shaking so bad, I swerve into the other lane. A truck horn blares and I yank the wheel back, nearly going off the road. I have to pull over on the highway shoulder just so I can gasp for air. Full panic attack, head and hands on the steering wheel trying to breathe. My phone explodes with calls. I answer them one by one. My mother in law is screaming, we just got to the hospital. Where are you? How dare you leave her right now? My father in law texts, get back here now. Man up and support your family. Then my mom calls, we're getting on a plane but that's five hours away. You need to step up as her big brother. Your sister has nobody. The baby might not survive. My dad texts, blood comes first. Your wife has family, your sister has no one. I sit there for a moment longer breathing. Then I call both hospitals. My sister's nurse says she's asking for you. She's terrified. My wife's nurse told me she's progressing fast. Where are you? My phone's at 5% battery from all the calls at this point. The last thing I hear is my mother in law saying If you're not here when that baby comes, don't bother coming home. My phone dies right there in my hands, still vibrating with another call coming in. I choose to go to my sister because she's alone and at higher risk. I speed toward her hospital, crying the whole way. I run into the emergency room, asking for her delivery room. The nurse looks confused.

I told a teenage girl she was gonna get assaulted working the night shift at a truck stop and she kicked me out for harassment. I've been driving trucks for 12 years now and I've seen people, men especially, at their darkest late at night on the road. I started driving trucks after my daughter was born because it paid better than warehouse work. My route takes me from Dallas up through Arkansas and into Tennessee. There's this one gas station that I try to avoid like a plague. It's one of those places where the parking lot lights are half broken and there's always sketchy stuff going down. Some nightmare on Elm Street shite last time I was there some tweaker tried to sell me a chainsaw at 3 in the morning. But sometimes you need gas and it's the only stop for 40 miles. This it happened about six months ago. I pulled in around 11 at night and noticed something was different right away. The old guy who usually work nights wasn't behind the counter. Instead there was this young girl who couldn't have been older than 19. She had bright purple hair and enough piercings to make her head explode in an MRI, full sleeve tattoos on both arms too. She was reading a textbook when I walked in so I figured she was a student. I grabbed an energy drink and beef jerky and Went up to pay. You new here, I asked while she rang me up. Yeah, started last week, she said, without looking up from scanning. They had a help wanted sign in the hours work with my class schedule. My stomach dropped a little. This girl had no idea what she'd signed up for. So I told her very respectfully, listen, I don't mean to pry, but you might want to find somewhere else to work. This place gets rough espe actually at night. She finally looked up at me and her face went hard. I can take care of myself, thanks. That annoyed me a little, but I needed her to understand. I'm sure you can, but the drivers that come through here aren't your average cost. Some of these guys have been on the road for days straight. They get weird ideas in their heads, especially when they see a young woman working alone. Is that supposed to be a threat? Her voice got sharp. No, I'm trying to warn you. I've been stopping here for years and I've seen some bad stuff go down. You need to at least keep some heat under the counter for Protection. Get out. She pointed at the door. I don't need some random trucker man explaining danger to me. I that I can handle myself. I don't even know what man'splaining is. I said, look, I have a daughter about your age and I'd want someone to tell her before I Could even say anything else. She screamed out, before I call the cops and report you for harassment, I held up my hands and backed away. Fine, I tried. Some people just won't listen when you're trying to help them. I paid for my stuff and left without another word. Back in my truck, I popped open the energy drink and did my usual safety check. Tires looked good. Load was cure. I was just about to pull out when I remembered I'd promised my wife I'd grab diapers on the way home. My wife just had another baby girl. She goes through them like crazy and we were almost out. I sat there for a minute debating whether to go back in. The girl clearly didn't want me there, but I really needed those diapers. I waited about five minutes to let things cool down, then headed back inside. The store was empty. That purple haired girl behind the counter, I hoped for the best and told myself maybe she was in the bathroom or on break. Then I heard.

The bride stopped mid pose, her photographer looked confused, and about 30 wedding guests turned to stare at my three year old daughter, Emma, standing by the playground swings. I was mortified. Emma had this habit of saying random things loudly at the worst possible moments, but this was next level embarrassing. Emma, honey, let's go play on the slides, I whispered, trying to drag her away from the wedding party, but she wasn't having it. She broke free from my grip and marched right up to the bride, tugging on her dress. Lady, don't marry the mean man, Emma said, pointing directly at the groom. He's gonna hurt you. Everyone went dead silent. The groom's face went red and he started walking toward us looking angry. Hey, what kind of kids says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just three and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve. My mommy had marks like that. When the bad man lived with us, she cried at night, too. Just like you smell like tears under your makeup. My heart stopped. This kid had been through way too much for her age, but she developed This weird ability to spot things adults tried to hide. When my ex was still around, Emma would always know when I'd been crying, even if I thought I'd covered it up perfectly.

All her friends are calling me Coffee Guy and telling me detailed stories about how much happier Emma's been since I started dating her. I didn't have the heart to correct them when they're all so genuinely grateful. Her best friend, Sarah, pulled me aside and whispered, I don't know what magic you worked, but Emma's been like a completely different person.

I honestly couldn't have done this without our Tuesday tradition, she said, tears streaming down her face. You've been my anchor when everything felt completely impossible. You showed me that I deserve good things happening to me randomly. I don't know how to properly thank you for saving my life. I realized I wasn't just bringing coffee anymore. I was accidentally someone's primary emotional support system and the foundation of their mental health recovery. Emma's therapist had apparently told her that having consistent, positive social interactions was absolutely crucial for her healing process. And somehow I'd become that irreplaceable person in her life. Now I'm four months deep into being someone's weekly lifeline because I couldn't handle 30 seconds of social awkwardness at a coffee Counter like a normal human being. Emma just texted me a three paragraph essay about how excited she is for me to meet her parents this weekend. They're flying in from Cincinnati specifically to meet the Coffee Angel who changed their daughter's life completely and helped her find herself again after losing hope. Her dad, Richard, apparently wants to take me golfing on Sunday morning to properly thank the young man who brought our Emma back to us when we thought we'd lost her forever. Her mom has been cooking my favorite meal all week, except Emma made up what my favorite food was because she was too embarrassed to admit she didn't actually know me that well. I'm completely trapped in being someone's accidental hero over a misheard you too that spiraled into becoming the most important person in a stranger's mental health journey and recovery process. The worst part, I actually look forward to Tuesdays now, too. And I think I'm falling for someone who's in love with a version of me that doesn't really exist.

So our textbook is wrong. The class erupted in whispers. Missus Wilson's voice got tight. The curriculum says, actually, I interrupted pulling up the state science standards on my phone. The current curriculum specifically mentions this myth as something to correct. I showed her the screen. That's when she asked me to step into the hallway. The kids watched wide eyed as the door closed behind us. Do you have any idea how hard it is to teach these kids when parents undermine my authority, she hissed. Now they'll question everything I say. I kept my voice calm. Isn't that exactly what we want them to do, question things and learn critical thinking? I've been teaching for 22 years, she snapped. I'm not changing my whole curriculum because some nurse thinks he knows better than our textbooks. At night, Lily asked me if she was in trouble because Missus Wilson kept giving her mean looks all afternoon. I assured her she wasn't. The next day, Missus Wilson announced a pop quiz with questions like, what color is blood inside the body? Lily answered red and got marked wrong. She came home crying with a big red F. I requested a meeting with the principal and brought printouts of medical textbooks, state science standards and Lily's Quiz. Principal Davis listened carefully, then called in Missus Wilson. When confronted with the evidence, Missus Wilson insisted. This is how I've always taught it, Principal Davis asked. But is it correct? After a long pause, Missus Wilson said, it's what the children understand better. I lost it. My daughter is crying every morning before school because she's afraid of getting F's for writing down the truth. Two weeks later, the school replaced their 1998 science books. Missus Wilson was required to attend professional development on current scientific standards. On Lily's next report card, Missus Wilson wrote, excellent critical thinking skills. But at the parent teacher conference, she wouldn't look me in the eye. And when I signed up to help with the science fair, I noticed my name had been crossed off the volunteer list. Lily still checks with me whenever she learns something new at school. Dad, is this actually true or is it just a missus Wilson truth?

My daughter's fourth grade teacher told her class that blood is blue inside your body and only turns red when it hits oxygen. Lily came home repeating this fact while showing me her veins. I gently explained, that's actually not true. Blood is always red because of hemoglobin. Just it's darker red in veins. She looked at me confused, but Missus Wilson showed us a whole Powerpoint about it. Dad. She even had diagrams from a science book. Next morning, I packed my work scrubs in my bag. I'm an ER nurse at Mercy General and I was working the 3 p m. Shift. Anyway, I sent Missus Wilson an email asking if I could do a quick 15 minute presentation about blood for Career Day that afternoon. She loved the idea. When I arrived, Missus Wilson introduced me as Lily's dad, who works at the hospital. Twenty eight kids stared up at me from their desks, covered in Lisa Frank folders and Minecraft pencil cases. I heard you guys Learned that blood is blue inside your body, I said. The entire class nodded enthusiastically. Missus Wilson beamed from her desk. I pulled out a vacutainer blood collection tube from my pocket. This is what we use to draw blood at the hospital. Notice something? I held it up. The tube creates a vacuum. No oxygen inside at all. Missus Wilson smile started fading as I explained When we draw blood with these, it never touches oxygen until we pop the cap off. But I showed photos on my phone of sealed blood tubes. See? Still red. The kids were fascinated. I showed them medical textbook pages on my tablet. Missus Wilson kept clearing her throat, her face getting redder than the blood samples on my screen. But our textbook says it's blue, one boy argued, pointing to their science book. I walked over and checked the publication date. 1998. Medicine updates pretty fast, I explained. We used to think lots of things that turned out to be wrong. Missus Wilson suddenly stood up. Well, thank you for that interesting presentation, Mister. Johnson, but we need to move on to math now. I nodded and started packing up. When a girl

She was posting thirst traps daily on Instagram, hitting different trendy bars every weekend with her girlfriends, clearly living her absolute best single life. According to Jake, she kept casually asking mutual friends if I was doing okay and seemed genuinely shocked that I I'd actually left the country for real. Month 3, my Japanese was finally good enough to have actual real conversations beyond ordering food. That's when I met Yuki at a language exchange meet up in a tiny cafe tucked away in Harajuku. She was studying international business at Waseda University, spoke absolutely perfect English and had this incredibly infectious laugh that made my chest feel tight. We started meeting twice a week to practice languages, but really we were just falling head over heels for each other. One random Thursday morning while Yuki and I were sharing convenience store coffee and those weird fluffy pancakes, my phone absolutely exploded with notification after notification. I made a huge mistake. I miss us so much. It hurts. This break was the stupidest idea ever. Can you please come home? I need you back in my life. Then another message I saw Jake post about Japan on his story. Are you seriously teaching little kids now? This whole thing is ridiculous. Another answer, me right now. We need to talk about this properly. You can't just ignore me forever. I screenshot all the messages And showed them to Yuki, who read through them carefully with raised eyebrows, then burst out laughing so hard she nearly spit out her coffee. Tell her you found someone who doesn't need breaks to figure out what she wants, he said in perfect English, playfully stealing a bite of my pancake with her chopsticks. So I sent back exactly that. I found someone who doesn't need breaks to know what she wants. Hope you eventually find what you're looking for. Lisa's response came back within literally two minutes. Pan was always a completely stupid idea anyway. You're throwing your entire life away for some ridiculous fantasy that won't last. I showed Yuki the bitter message. She just smiled sweetly and said, should we tell her about our engagement party next month? We both started laughing so hard, the convenience store clerk started giving us really weird looks. Definitely the best break of my entire life.

I replied, I understand. What she didn't know was that I've been planning to propose next week. The ring was already hidden in my sock drawer, a vintage emerald cut that cost me three months salary. I talked to her dad over beers at his favorite sports bar, booked our anniversary restaurant for Valentine's Day, even practiced the speech in my car during lunch breaks like a complete idiot. But when Lisa sat me down that Tuesday night, her face all serious and uncomfortable, talking about needing space to grow, grow as individuals and finding ourselves, I just nodded calmly. Take all the time you need, I said. Watching her fidget nervously with that silver bracelet I bought her last Christmas. She looked genuinely confused by how calm I was staying. Probably expected me to bed egg, cry, make some desperate emotional speech about our four years together and all our future plans. Instead, I helped her pack her overnight bag, even folded her clothes neatly. The whole time she kept glancing at me like she was waiting for me to break down. The next morning, first thing, I walked straight into the jewelry store downtown and returned the ring, $2,000 back in my account just like that. The jeweler looked sympathetic but didn't ask questions. Then I did something completely insane. I bought a one way ticket to Tokyo, leaving in 10 days. I'd always dreamed Of teaching English in Japan since college. But Lisa absolutely hated the idea whenever I brought it up, called it running away from real adult responsibility and said I was being childish and unrealistic. We had our whole life mapped out. House in the suburbs, two kids, white picket fence. The worst, two weeks later, I was standing in Shibuya crossing with one suitcase and absolutely terrible. Japanese found a tiny teaching job at a conversation school in Akihabara, rented a shoebox apartment with paper thin walls, started learning the language from complete scratch using phone apps and YouTube videos. For the first time in years, life felt electric and unpredictable. Every single day was an adventure. Meanwhile.

Sure. I said, you got $32,000 for tuition. I'm building my brand, bro. Then build your way out of my driveway. Saturday morning, Marcus went full influencer meltdown, posted that I was an abusive narcissist, tagged half the family, captioned it, toxic father can't handle the truth. It blew up over 1,000 likes. But the comments, brutal. Bro said he wasn't his real dad and still wanted dad's money. Even my brother texted, want me to comment? I said, nah, let him cook. By Sunday, Marcus was officially expelled from Westfield Academy. He stomped into my room yelling, you ruined my life. Now I have to go to public school. Talk to Dante, I said. Maybe he can get you verified. That night, Veronica tried filing an emergency custody order to force me to keep paying. The judge literally laughed. Private school isn't a necessity, I said. Case dismissed. A few hours later, I found a note under my door. Dad, I messed up. Mom and Dante filled my head with lies. He's broke. She's miserable. I lost the only person who ever cared about me. I'm sorry. Didn't respond. Let him sit with that one. A few days later, he broke down for real. I just wanted to make her proud. She said, you were controlling, that you ruined her life. I laughed. She left because she wanted to sell protein powder on Instagram. That's her dream. Not exactly Nobel Prize material. Then Karma delivered the finale. Dante got arrested selling fake pre workout online. One of his clients ended up in the hospital. Cops found boxes of counterfeit supplements in his trunk. Veronica called me dreaming. This is your fault. If you hadn't been so petty, click blocked. Now Marcus goes to public school, says the kids are more real. Met a girl named Maya who called him entitled on day 1. She's right. I told him keep her. A week later, Veronica showed up again with her sister and Dante's mom begging me to forget. I told them he's learning the difference between love and convenience. That's a lesson worth every penny. Now Dante's in jail, Veronica's back on Tinder. Marcus is working part time, saving up for a used Honda. The car I sold paid off my mortgage. The college funds still sitting untouched. People say I went too far, but I didn't teach him a lesson. Life did. He said I wasn't his real dad. Now he knows what real consequences look like.

Mom's boyfriend is better. I said, okay. Then I stopped the private school payments and sold his car. 72 hours later, his mother was threatening legal action. I raised Marcus alone since he was 8. His mom, Veronica, ditched us for some gym bro named Dante, with a protein shake in one hand and a selfie stick in the other. She didn't want custody. She wanted freedom. So I gave it to her. For nine years, it was just me and Marcus, private school, summer camps, BMW for his 16th, all paid from overtime and sweat. I wasn't rich. I just loved my kid. Then out of nowhere, Veronica pops back in like a bad sequel. She's all designer bags and fake smile. And suddenly Marcus starts spending weekends at her place. Then one Sunday he comes home with Dante's Cologne on his hoodie and a new attitude. He looks me dead in the eye and says, you're not my real dad. Dante gets me better. He actually supports my dreams. Just stared at him. Your dreams of what? Being an influencer. Dante says I have natural charisma. I nodded once. Okay. The next morning I called his school, canceled tuition, listed his car online. By lunch, I had $30,000 sitting pretty in my account. By that afternoon, Marcus came running into the house red faced and crying. They said, I can't take my exams if you don't pay. Ask Your real father figure, I said, cracking a beer. The meltdown was instant. Veronica started blowing up my phone, 47 texts in a day. You can't abandon your son like this, Dante's cousin says. This is illegal. I texted back once, asked Dante to cover it. Next day she stormed into my job screaming in front of my boss that I was ruining Marcus's view. Security dragged her out while my boss just nodded and said, stand your ground, man. That night, Marcus tried the sympathy act, cooked dinner, cleaned his room, even apologized. I didn't mean it, dad. I was just mad. You're my real father, right? and this has nothing to do with your car and school disappearing. He froze. That's different. Get out of my face, Marcus. By Friday, the circus rolled up. Veronica, her sister and Dante's mom, Rosa, 65, dressed like she owned the Vatican start. It's preaching about family values in our family, she says. We don't abandon children. Then pay for his school. I said. Dante strolls in wearing a tank top in December and go.

Then you won't mind explaining why you downloaded his Henderson campaign at 2:00am and presented it word for word as your original work. Derek started stuttering. Michael never said it was his. He shared it openly. Janet interrupted. Actually, Michael emails me his work directly for approval. Your name has never been on any of these projects until you stole them. This is a misunderstanding. Michael and I work together closely. Thomas looked up from his notes. Mister Chen, would you like to respond to that? I've been sitting quietly in the corner letting them present the evidence. Actually, Derek, we've never collaborated on a single project. You taking my work, claimed credit and now tried to get me fired to cover your tracks. Derek turned desperate. This is insane. Michael's just upset that I'm more successful. Ask anyone on the team who the real contributor is. That's when Thomas said something that made Derek's world collapse. Actually, we did ask someone. We asked Michael's brother. His brother. You know him as the company president, Robert Chen. Derek's mouth fell open. Expensive suit. Guy was my brother, Robert, who'd been taking notes on Derek's corporate theft case. You mean the Michael Chen I've been hearing about in family dinners for the past six months? Is the same Michael Chen whose work you've been stealing? Derek looked between us, finally seeing the family resemblance he'd missed when Michael mentioned his coworker was taking credit for his ideas. I suggested he document everything and let it play out. I wanted to see how far someone would go. Robert closed his notebook. Derek, you're terminated effective immediately. Security will escort you out. Wait, this isn't fair. I didn't know he was your brother. That's exactly the point. You thought you could steal from someone who couldn't fight back. After Derek was walked out, Robert turned to me. Why didn't you just tell me who was stealing your work? I wanted to handle it professionally, not through family connections. Well, you handled it perfectly. The documentation you provided will help us prevent this from happening to other employees. Janet smiled. Derek spent months trying to get rid of the wrong person. Turns out he was trying to eliminate his boss's brother while stealing from the company president's family.

What he didn't know was that our boss was my older brother. Started small, then escalated to claiming my entire project proposals as his original ideas. I documented everything instead of confronting him. Screenshots, time stamps, recorded sessions. I figured the truth would come out naturally. The breaking point came during our quarterly review meeting. Derek stood up with my entire marketing campaign, the one I'd spent three weeks developing for the Henderson account, and presented it as his breakthrough concept. I've been working nights and weekends on this, he told the room, really pushing myself to think outside the box for our biggest client. I sat there watching him describe my color schemes, my taglines, even my budget projections, word for word from the presentation I shared with him the week before, asking for feedback as a colleague. After the meeting, Derek cornered me in the break room. You seemed quiet in there, Michael. Everything okay? Just listening. I said, good, because honestly, I've been meaning to talk to you about stepping up your game. The team needs people who contribute original thinking, not just clock watchers. That's stung. Derek looked me up and down dismissively. Maybe consider whether this role is right for your skill set. The next day, Derek scheduled a meeting with our boss, requesting my transfer to a different department. He told Janet that I was holding Back team productivity. Janet listened to his concerns, then asked to speak with me privately. Michael, Derek says you're not contributing ideas and the team's frustrated with your participation. I nodded. What do you think? Janet smiled. I think Derek doesn't know who he's talking about. I've been watching this for months. Derek's been presenting your work as his own. You knew? I know because you emailed me your drafts before every project. I've seen your original files with time stamps. Derek's been accessing shared folders and copying your work. Why didn't you say anything? I wanted to see how far he'd take it. Janet opened her laptop. All file access is logged. Here's Derek downloading your Henderson campaign at 2:00am last Tuesday. He's accessed your files 43 times in two months. So what happens now? Now Derek gets to explain to HR why he's been committing intellectual property theft while trying to frame his victim for poor performance. The HR meeting was scheduled for Friday afternoon. Derek walked in confident, expecting to discuss my transfer to the filing department. Instead, he found Janet, the HR director, and someone he didn't recognize.

The hospital co pays the car insurance, your medications, all me. Dad, panic flashed across his face. Mom, the credit card you opened in my name three years ago, I paid it off. But not this. Not anymore. They were stunned because I'd said it out loud. Dad stepped forward. You're going to regret this. I'll freeze every.

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. We'll clean it up. Please don't. But Elena was already rushing over, not to slap Cologne, but instead to kneel beside me. Honey, stop, you'll cut yourself. She gently took my hands, checking for cuts. Are you two okay? Did you step on any glass? Cologne just laughed. I'm fine, mom. Sorry about the juice. She ruffled his hair in response, which shocked me beyond belief. It's just juice, baby. Accidents happen. Let me get the mop. No timer, no rice, no locked doors, just a mop and a new glass of juice later. When I reached for a third lumpia, I froze, waiting for someone to slap my hand away. Elena noticed and pushed the whole plate toward me. Eat, eat. Growing boys need food. When dinner time came and I said I had to leave, she packed me a container of food for later, she said, winking. Cally complained his report card came and he got a C in English. I tensed waiting for the explosion. Elena just sighed and said, we'll get you a tutor. These things happen. It felt so weird watching this, watching how Chloe's mother never got angry at him for doing something wrong. I even started thinking if this is how a normal home looks like. We were washing dishes together after dinner when I accidentally knocked over Elena's favorite mug, the One that said World's Okayest mom that Tolloy had given her. It shattered against their tile floor. I went completely rigid, my whole body preparing for impact. The apology stuck in my throat. I could already feel my knees against rice, already felt the sun on my face. It's okay, Elena said softly, but I was already crying. Not just tears, but uncontrollable sobbing I couldn't control. Elena was sweeping up the pieces, humming, sweetheart, what's wrong, she asked, hailing beside me. It's just a mug. Why are you so scared? Clyde was staring at me like I'd grown another head. What did you think was going to happen? He asked. I tried to hold it in, but couldn't. I told them about how my mom treated me, about how I thought I was going to be punished severely because I'd broken that mug. Elena's face went through expressions I'd never seen on an adult, horror, rage, then something soft and broken. She pulled me into a hug that felt warm. Then she asked, how many times has that happened? Culloy patted my back as I answered, too many to count. When I finished talking, Elena looked at me for a long moment. You're not going home tonight, she said firmly. She picked up her phone, scrolled through her contacts. Culloy squeezed my shoulder as she dialed. Hello. I need to report child abuse.

My boss Joseph wasn't bluffing about the no workplace dating policy. Anyone caught dating got fired immediately. That couple from the business department fired. Mr. And Mrs. Wolowitz divorced. Even my friend Sasha got transferred to another branch for carpooling with another guy to work. If anyone was caught, even just talking for more than five minutes, they'd get called to his office to get lectured. So things were pretty rough in the office. Few people did try to reason with him, but he refused to budge. Workplace romances hurt productivity, he'd say. But everyone knew he was just bitter about the messy divorce with his secretary wife. So now we were all suffering. I'd always been careful about that rule until I met Lance from I T. That day, I was completely panicking. I'd worked all night for an important project, only for my laptop to freeze. One hour before the meeting, Lance came over from the fourth floor and helped me recover my files while making terrible puns to calm me down. Hey, why was the computer cold? It left its windows open. God, it was bad. But I laughed anyway. When he finally saved everything, I almost hugged him. Then we both froze. Right. The rule. Before I left for the meeting, he wrote his number on a sticky note and handed it to me shyly. Here, in case you run into more computer problems. I felt my cheeks flush. I Stared at that sticky note for three days before texting him. We met up at a tiny coffee shop two blocks from the office. During lunchtime, we sat in the back corner, covering ourselves like criminals. Every time the door opened, we both look up, panicked. I watched him duck into the table. When someone from his department walked in to pick up coffee, I laughed. Wow. Crazy first date, huh? He grinned back at me from underneath the table. I love crazy. We were still pretty paranoid on the next few dates. But after three months, we started to get comfortable. Maybe a little too comfortable. That's when it happened. A close call. When we were out at an Italian restaurant to celebrate my promotion, Lance suddenly went ghost white. We need to leave now. But it was too late. Our boss, Joseph, entered the restaurant and locked eyes with us. He marched over, practically foaming at the mouth. Mind telling me what's going on, Lance? And waitress from marketing. Lance stood up slowly. Dad, I can explain. Dad. I choked. Joseph glanced at our table full of candles and rose petals. Clearly not for a casual meeting. You're dating my son in my company, breaking my rules. The entire restaurant got quiet, watching months of secret dating all go down the drain. You're fired. You can forget about the Japanese presentation tomorrow. I won't have liars and rule breakers in my company. I got up and managed to Squeeze out a have a good evening before running out. Next morning, I came in early to pack my desk before everyone arrived, but Lance was already there waiting.

I forgot to take out the trash before six PM and started crying before my mom even said anything because I knew what was coming. She grabbed my arm, dragged me to the kitchen and poured uncooked rice across the floor. Kneel on it, she said. I dropped to my knees and the rice dug into my skin like tiny needles. She set the microwave timer for 20 minutes. You'll stay there until it beeps. This is how you learn discipline. My knees went numb after five minutes, but if I shifted even slightly, she'd restart the timer. I'm making you perfect. This is what love looks like. That wasn't just normal for us. It was routine. When I got a B instead of an a, she'd make me stand outside in the sun for three hours. No water, doors locked, neighbors walking by pretending not to see. The world is cruel, she'd say when she finally let me back in. I'm preparing you for it. Every punishment makes you stronger. This is how a good mother loves her son. Then a new kid named Cloy transferred into my class and he became my first friend. After I helped him with an assignment, he told me, come to my place after school. My mom makes incredible Filipino food. I almost said no, but I hadn't eaten anything except school lunch in two days. So I said yes, hoping I Could make it back home by 5. Just for an hour, I said, already calculating how fast I need to run home. His house was only six blocks from school, a small two story with a garden full of tomatoes and a doormat that said welcome in three languages. His mom, Elena, opened the door before we could knock. You must be Chloe's friend. Come in. Come in. I made lumpia. She had flower in her hair, but it didn't dampen her bright smile. The house smelled like fried food and something we baking, not like the cigarette smoke and cheap wine that clung to our walls. A few minutes later, as Chloe was carrying two glasses of juice, he tripped over their cat. The glass shattered across the hardwood floor, orange juice spreading everywhere. My brain froze and I acted on instinct. I immediately dropped to my knees.

Then build your way out of my driveway. Saturday morning, Marcus went full influencer meltdown. Posted that I was an abusive narcissist, tagged half the family, captioned it toxic father can't handle the truth. It blew up over 1,000 likes. But the comments. Brutal. Bro said he wasn't his real dad and still wanted dad's money. Even my brother texted, want me to comment? I said, nah, let him cook. By Sunday, Marcus was officially expelled from Westfield Academy. He stomped into my room yelling, you ruined my life, now I have to go to public school. Talk to Dante, I said. Maybe he can get you verified. That night, Veronica tried filing an emergency custody order to me to keep paying. The judge literally laughed. Private school isn't a necessity, he said. Case dismissed. A few hours later, I found a note under my door. Dad, I messed up. Mom and Dante filled my head with lies. He's broke, she's miserable. I lost the only person who ever cared about me. I'm sorry. Didn't respond. Let him sit with that one. A few days later, he broke down for real. Dad, I just wanted to make her proud. She said you were controlling, that you ruined her life. I laughed. She left because she wanted to sell protein powder on Instagram. That's her dream. Not exactly Nobel Prize material. Then Karma delivered. The finale. Dante got arrested selling fake pre workout online. One of his clients ended up in the hospital. Cops found boxes of counterfeit supplements in his trunk. Veronica called me screaming, this is your fault. If you hadn't been so petty. Click blocked. Now. Marcus goes to public school. Says the kids are more real. Met a girl named Maya who called him entitled on day one. She's right. I told him. Keep her. A week later, Veronica showed up again with her sister and Dante's mom, begging me to forgive. I told them he's learning the difference between love and convenience. That's a lesson worth every penny. Now Dante's in jail, Veronica's back on Tinder. Marcus is working part time, saving up for a used Honda. The car I sold paid off my mortgage. The college fund still sitting untouched. People say I went too far, but I didn't teach him a lesson. Life did. He said I wasn't his real dad. Now he knows what real consequences look like.

Mom's boyfriend is better. I said, okay. Then I stopped the private school payments and sold his car. 72 hours later, his mother was threatening legal action. I raised Marcus alone since he was 8. His mom, Veronica, ditched us for some gym bro named Dante, with a protein shake in one hand and a selfie stick in the other. She didn't want custody. She wanted freedom. So I gave it to her. For nine years, it was just me and Marcus, private school, summer camps, BMW for his 16th, all paid from overtime and sweat. I wasn't rich. I just loved my kid. Then out of nowhere, Veronica pops back in like a bad sequel. She's all designer bags and fake smile. And suddenly Marcus starts spending weekends at her place. Then one Sunday he comes home with Dante's Cologne on his hoodie and a new attitude. He looks me dead in the eye and says, you're not my real dad. Dante gets me better. He actually supports my dreams. Just stared at him. Your dreams of what? Being an influencer. Dante says I have natural charisma. I nodded once. Okay. The next morning I called his school, canceled tuition, listed his car online. By lunch, I had $30,000 sitting pretty in my account. By that afternoon, Marcus came running into the house red faced and crying. They said, I can't take my exams if you don't pay. Ask Your real father figure, I said, cracking a beer. The meltdown was instant. Veronica started blowing up my phone, 47 texts in a day. You can't abandon your son like this. Dante's cousin says. This is illegal. I texted back once, asked Dante to cover it. Next day she stormed into my job screaming in front of my boss that I was ruining Marcus's view. Security dragged her out while my boss just nodded and said, stand your ground, man. That night, Marcus tried the sympathy act, cooked dinner, cleaned his room, even apologized. I didn't mean it, dad. I was just mad. You're my real father, right? and this has nothing to do with your car and school disappearing. He froze. That's different. Get out of my face, Marcus. By Friday, the circus rolled up. Veronica, her sister and Dante's mom, Rosa, 65, dressed like she owned the Vatican. Starts preaching about family values in our family, she says.

Take that package and leave my house through the same window you just crawled in from. His shoulders slumped and he pointed to the floor before saying, you don't know what is under here. His voice was starting to get frantic and he was scaring me more and more with each passing second. They living under you must get out. I finally decided enough was enough. I'm calling the police. But then I heard something that made me freeze completely. More footsteps, not just his multiple sets of feet moving quickly, urgently like people scrambling. But they weren't coming from my apartment. They sounded like they were coming from below. I ran as fast as I could to the guest room and lock the door behind me. Then I dialed 9, 1 1 while barricading my door with my dresser. There's a delivery driver invading my apartment, I whispered to the operator. But as I spoke, I looked out my bedroom window facing the backyard and my stomach dropped. My brain couldn't even process what I was seeing. A massive hatch I'd never noticed was wide open in my garden looking like it had been hidden under fake grass. A man and Woman were climbing out carrying bags and two small kids. They ran south and scaled my fence in seconds like they've done this before. Ma'am, are you there? The operator kept asking. I just stared at that hole in my yard. There were people, I whispered underground. I stayed barricaded in my guest room until the cops arrived. But once they arrested the delivery driver, he asked for a translator and pointed them towards the back yard telling them to dig down. Well, they did and they found an entire apartment under my house. A furnished apartment with electricity stolen from my lines and plumbing tapped into mine. A family of four had been living there for months. The delivery driver explained everything. He had seen someone face peek out from underground when he walked up to deliver my package. In his country, he'd seen this before. Squatters getting desperate, sometimes violent. He was trying to warn me, trying to get me out before something bad happened. She was in danger, he kept telling the cops. Very bad people sometimes. I tried to thank him properly, but he just shrugged and said in his broken English is normal thing, delivery drivers, we protect customers wait. Since when?

I reached for my package wanting to end this conversation any second, but he pulled it back. My boyfriend will be back any minute now, I said louder, hoping this creepy dude would get the hint. The driver shook his head slowly muttering something I couldn't understand. His eyes kept scanning my living room like he was memorizing it. I panicked, thinking he was about to lunch, slammed the door in his face and turned the deadbolt. Look, I've seen enough tik toks about creepy delivery guys to know where this goes. But 15 minutes later, when I peeked through my blinds to check if he was gone, his white van was still there. When our eyes met through the window, I dropped to the floor and once again waited for him to leave. But then my phone lit up with a text from him saying, please come outside. Need to talk. Important thing. I didn't reply, so he sent another text. Get in delivery van. I show you something. I felt goosebumps all over my skin from how sketchy this Guy was. And I almost wanted to call the cops. But then he texted again saying, you're not safe there alone. Please trust. Very urgent matter. I took a deep breath and texted him back telling him to leave immediately. I even threatened that if he didn't take his truck off my property, I would call the cops. But as I was typing, I suddenly heard footsteps in my bedroom. The thing is, I actually was home alone, so these footsteps could only belong to one person. I rushed to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and slowly crept towards my bedroom. As I opened the door, I caught the driver climbing through my window while holding my package. Ma'am, you left package outside, he called out in broken English. I pointed the knife right at his face and yelled, get out. Get out of my house, you creep, or else I'll stab you. He raised his hands far above his hands and said he was just handing me my package. I didn't understand. Why would he.

What happened? My third month on the force, I Learned that Detective Reynolds ran this precinct like his personal kingdom. Everyone walked on eggshells around him because he had connections all the way up to the commissioner's office. As the new guy, I tried to stay invisible. But Reynolds had other plans. He cornered me in the locker room one morning and said, college boy, huh? Let me teach you how real police work gets done. Reynolds was a 15 year veteran who never faced consequences for anything. He had this way of bending rules just enough to stay under the radar while making life miserable for anyone who crossed him. Other officers would warn me quietly that questioning Reynolds was career suicide. So I kept my mouth shut and tried to learn the job properly. riding with Reynolds was like watching a master class in corruption. He pull over expensive cars in affluent neighborhoods always walk away with cash donations to the Police Benevolent Fund. He confiscated evidence from drug busts that never quite made it to the property room. Most disturbing was how he treated witnesses and suspects using intimidation tactics that bordered on torture. The breaking point came during a domestic violence call at a run down apartment complex. A woman named Maria had called 9 1 1 saying her boyfriend was threatening her with a baseball bat. When we arrived, Reynolds immediately dismissed her concerns. And started flirting with her while she was still shaking with fear. He told her boyfriend, who was clearly intoxicated and aggressive, that these things happen in relationships and maybe they should work it out like adults. Maria begged us not to leave, showing us bruises on her arms from previous incidents. Reynolds laughed and said domestic calls were just drama Queens looking for attention. He started walking back to our patrol car while the boyfriend got more agitated at Maria for calling the police. I could see the terror in her eyes as she realized we were abandoning her with someone who'd been threatening her life. That's when Reynolds made his fatal mistake. Instead of following protocol and either arresting the boyfriend or staying until the situation was resolved, he decided to teach everyone a lesson about wasting police time. He walked back to the apartment, grabbed Maria by the arm and shoved her toward her boyfriend.

I care about my teenage boy, but I'd be dishonest if I said I wasn't let down by the kind of person he's becoming. My son began getting into this different look back when he was in middle school. At first he just wore black clothes, but once he got to high school, he's gone way too far with his strange style and I really don't like it. My wife doesn't seem to mind, but she's a pretty passive woman and has never been a very strict parent like me. If I were to describe how my son dresses now, he wears big, baggy black clothing and lots of chains and rings. At one point, he was even dying coloured strips into his hair. I remember being so upset the first day I saw this. It was just so embarrassing to see my child walking around like that. Now, I don't have a problem with gay people or anything like that, but I never really wanted that type of thing to be a part of my own household. I've never confronted my son about his sexuality and I really just don't wanna know if he does happen to be. Our relationship is already sort of strained and I feel like if I found out he wasn't straight, it would make it very hard for me to treat him the same. Like I said, I don't have a problem with gay people. I just don't wanna be shoved in my face on top of everything. Ever since my son entered high school, he's made friends with mostly girls. At first I was glad to see this, and I was happy that my son still might have a chance of growing up into a real man's man. But as time went on, I realized that he wasn't in a relationship with any of these girls dead. They were all just his close friends. He constantly has his friends over the house and is part of a friend group with three other girls. To be fair, these girls have always been nothing but polite to me and my wife and are always respectful of our house. Still, it just rubs me the wrong way that my son doesn't seem to have any close guy friends. And I feel like it's not good for him to grow up that way. I tried my best to be non judgmental towards my son, even though to me he looked like more of a freak of nature. Every day the more he kept leaning into his alternative fashion. I didn't understand it, since all of his friends were normal girls. He was the only weirdo in his friend group who dressed like some 90s mall rat. When I look at him, he honestly reminds me of the kind of kids I would pick on in high school. Anyway, about a Year ago, I ran out of patience with him when he came home one day with his nails painted a shade of bright blue. My son had never done anything like this before, and I couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly disgusted. I. I told him that he had gone too far with his emo bullshit and that I couldn't continue letting him make a fool out of himself like this. I told him that at one point he needed to become a man, and painting his nails made him look like some sort of weak top. My son and I had never really been close. We didn't even speak that often, so he looked very hurt as I was telling him all this. But I couldn't help it. He had needed a reality check for so long and there was no avoiding this conversation. I told my son to go get nail polish remover and remove his nail polish right there in front of me. That's when he started to get angry and said that he didn't have to change himself just to appease my dumb homophobic self. My son has never spoken to either of his parents this way, and I knew that there was no way I was letting him get away with it. I yelled at him for cursing at me like that, and I told him that he would remove his nail polish immediately or there would be serious consequences. He said that there was nothing Worse I could do to him than continue being such a hateful father. And that's when I lost my shot. I told him that I would ground him for the entire year if he didn't remove his nail polish within the next 60 seconds. Looked at me and told me that I could try, but I would never be able to control him and that he hated me. He ran up to his room after this, and I followed through on my threat. I took his phone away and replaced it with a flip phone, and he wasn't allowed to go out or have his friends over anymore. All he did after that for the rest of the year was call his friends in his room and completely ignore me. One night, I overheard him crying to my wife about how much he hated his life since being grounded. But all she said was that I was his father and he needed to respect me. Proud of my wife for sticking up to me behind closed doors. And I still felt like I had made the right decision. I won't lie and say that it hasn't been a difficult year. My son stopped talking to me the day I grounded him, and I honestly do miss him. He graduates next year, and I just hope before then he'll realise that I was only ever trying to do what was best for him.

I need extra hands. Yeah, I don't think so. I wasn't about to climb into a bathroom stall with a freak. No, please. I think I might bleed out. Her voice was shaking. And suddenly this wasn't funny anymore. It was summer from my English class, a pregnant senior who everyone whispered about but nobody really talked to. She was sitting on the toilet, gripping the handicap rail with white knuckles, and her face was covered in sweat. What's wrong? I asked, even though I was starting to guess. Please do something. I'm giving birth. She looked up at me with pure terror in her eyes. My whole body went cold. I was 17 and barely knew how tampons worked, let alone babies. But she was crying and alone, and I couldn't just leave her there. I hopped over the stall divider awkwardly and almost slipped on the wet floor. That's when I saw it. The baby was already crowning. There was blood on the toilet seat and the floor, and summer was making the low groaning sounds that scared me more than anything. This was actually happening in a gross school bathroom with fluorescent lights and graffiti on the walls. I'll be right back. I ran out of the bathroom. Still in shock. I sprinted down the hallway to Missus Bashar's classroom. She was my favourite teacher and The only adult I could think of who wouldn't freak out, I burst through her door, interrupting her lecture on photosynthesis. The whole class stared at me. I need your help urgently, please. I was out of breath and probably looked insane. Missus Bashar took one look at my face and followed me without asking questions. We ran back to the bathroom and I could hear summer sounds getting louder. Other kids were starting to peek out of classrooms wondering what was happening. Missus Bashar pushed open the stall door and immediately went into teacher mode. Okay, honey, I'm here. You're doing great. I'm going to support you while she gets the nurse. I didn't need to be told twice. I ran to the nurse's office faster than I'd ever run in PE. When I burst through the door, Nurse Patty was checking Casey's temperature. Casey, who everyone knew was Summer's boyfriend, the guy who'd been bragging about becoming a dad at prom. Summer's having her baby in the bathroom right now. I basically screamed it. Casey's face went from white to green. He threw up all over the floor before Nurse Patty could grab a trash can. But we didn't have time to deal with that. The three of us ran back to the bathroom with nurse Patty grabbing emergency supplies from her cabinet. By now, half the school had heard something was happening. Kids were crowding outside the bathroom door trying to figure out what all the screaming Was about teachers were trying to move them back to class, but nobody was listening. When we got back to the stall, it was chaos. Missus Bashar was holding Summer's hand while she pushed. The nurse immediately took over, checking how dilated she was and telling summer to breathe. Casey stood frozen in the doorway looking like he might pass out. That's when summer grabbed my hand and pulled me close. You have to get.

Where did you write down how to make Antonio's plate? Carlos is freaking out. I texted back, everything should be in the kitchen somewhere. There's nothing here. Just the regular menu recipes. Of course, there wasn't anything written down. All those special orders lived in my head, like Don Roberto's Saturday special with my secret salsa blend that took me three years to perfect. Or Maria's eggs with that specific combination of peppers she'd been ordering for 15 years. I knew exactly how much of each spice to use, which vendors sold the best chilies and how every regular like their tortillas toasted. At 8:30, Elena called me directly. Miguel, Don Roberto's whole family is here for their monthly gathering, 12 people, and they all want their usual orders. Roberto's asking for you specifically. I wish I could help, I said. And I really meant it because I like Don Roberto and his family. By 9:00am, owner Rosa Herrera called begging me to come back for triple pay. But I told her I'd already started at Lupita's Kitchen down the street. Elena texted that Don Roberto waited exactly 20 minutes before standing up with his entire 12 person family and announcing they were going to find wherever Miguel's cooking now. And within an hour, half the breakfast crowd had followed them to Lupita's. At noon, Carlos called accusing me of sabotage and theft. Those recipes are company property. What? Those were my creations from 12 years. Made with spices I bought myself and notes in my personal notebook. He threatened to sue, but I told him to check with Rosa about what belonged to the company and he hung up. That afternoon, Carlos posted on Facebook about exciting standardized menu improvements, but comments destroyed him, with customers asking where I went and saying they'd never come back. One lady wrote her mother had been coming for 30 years and Saturday was her first walk out. Monday, I was officially at Lupitas with a 45% raise plus a share of breakfast sales. Thursday, Elena texted that Carlos got fired after Rosa discovered he'd been stealing by lying about food costs and the community center switched their catering to Lupitas. Friday morning, Don Roberto sat at his new regular table while I served his Saturday special with extra jalapenos Miguel, he said with a big smile, this tastes just like it should.

Growing up, Haley never missed a chance to remind me I wasn't real family. Every sibling fight ended the same way. At least my parents actually wanted me from the start, instead of getting stuck with leftovers. It stung every single time. Our parents loved me. I knew that. But Haley's words planted seeds of doubt. Was I really chosen, or was I just convenient? When I was 15, something shifted. I overheard mom and dad talking about how they wish they could connect better with different cultures, especially after watching a Korean drama together. Mom sighed and said, I wish I could speak another language. It would open up so many conversations. That's when I got my idea. I started learning Korean in secret. Every night after homework, I'd use language apps with headphones. I found online tutor and told my parents the money was for school projects. I watched K dramas without subtitles, practice pronunciation until my jaw ached. Even started cooking Korean recipes I found online during weekends when everyone was out. Meanwhile, Haley was busy dating Daniel, this guy she met at community college. She'd constantly brag about how cultured and worldly he was because he'd spent a semester in Europe. She'd make snotty comments like, some people are naturally interesting, others are just basic, always looking right at me when she said it. What made it worse was That our parents seemed impressed by Daniel, too. They'd ask him about his travels, his experience, princes treating him like he was this sophisticated addition to our family dinners. Daniel was actually pretty nice to me, but Haley would always cut our conversation short. Don't bore him with your random interests, she say, rolling her eyes. The perfect opportunity came during Haley's graduation party from community college. She'd invited Daniel and insisted he bring his parents, who had immigrated from Korea when he was young. She wanted to show off her international boyfriend's family to all our relatives. But when Daniel's parents arrived, everything went sideways. They spoke very little English, and Daniel was really stressed trying to

I'm a paralegal at Michelin Associates downtown, and I've been helping dad update his will for the past six months. Every Saturday morning, we'd meet at the coffee shop near his house, order black coffee and a blueberry muffin, and we'd go through everything, line by line. Emily had no idea. She kept going, her voice getting louder and more confident. Dad and I talked every single day. He told me exactly how he wanted things handled. The house, the savings account, his veterans benefits. He wanted me to oversee all of it. I glanced at my mom sitting next to me. She looked confused, her tissues crumpled in her hands. They'd been divorced for 15 years, but she'd come anyway because dad, specifically Asked her to be there. That should have been Emily's first clue. Something was off. Some people, Emily continued, her eyes landing on me for just a second, only showed up when it was convenient. But I was there for dad when it mattered. My hands started shaking. I pulled out my phone and open the documents folder. Everything was backed up there. The will, the notes from our meetings, even the text messages where dad joked about Emily's upcoming surprise. Emily was really warming up now. Dad always said family was everything to him. That's why he trusted me to carry out his legacy.

And he'd be all relaxed, like, hey, everyone, come in! Like he did something. One time, he invited his parents and didn't tell me until I was already at target buying stuff for myself. I had to abandon my cart and go buy ingredients for his mom's favorite pot roast recipe that takes three hours to make. I literally got home with two hours left. I didn't even eat that night because I was so stressed. But the worst one was when he told me his college buddies were coming over in four hours. Four hours? It was a Saturday, and I've been planning to deep clean my closet all day. I was in old Sweats with my hair in a messy bun, no bra, looking rough. He texted me at, like, 2 in the afternoon. Hey, babe, Jake, Kevin, and Brad are coming at six. Can you grab some steaks and make that potato salad they liked last time? I just sat there staring at my phone. That potato salad takes forever because you have to boil the potatoes, let them cool, dice everything super small. Plus, our house was a disaster. There were dishes in the sink from breakfast, laundry on the couch. The bathroom hadn't been cleaned in a week. I texted back, you're inviting people in four hours? And didn't ask me first. He goes, it's not a big deal. They're chill. Yeah, they're chill because they're not the ones doing anything. They just show up, eat free food, mess up the house, and leave. So I looked around at the mess, looked at myself in the mirror, and I just grabbed my person, left. Didn't clean anything, didn't go to the store, just got in my car and drove to my sister

I told him I'm not allergic to peanuts, so why would I label my own lunch? maybe Riley should stop taking things that don't belong to her. He threatened to fire me on the spot, but I reminded him that would be wrongful termination, since I literally did nothing wrong. I even said if he or anyone harasses me over this, I'm going straight to HR. That made him even more mad, and he stormed off. Now half the office won't talk to me. The older employees who suck up to my boss are acting like I'm some kind of monster. They whisper when I walk by, and one lady even said, I could have killed that girl. Like, yeah, I know that, but how is that on me? She stole my food multiple times. If you have a deadly allergy, maybe don't eat random food that isn't yours. Riley came back to work Monday with her dad, and she actually had the nerve to glare at me like I'm the villain here. Her throat was still kind of messed up, and she looked rough. I'm not apologizing. My boss pulled me into his office again and tried to get me to agree to pay part of her medical bills. I laughed and said, absolutely not. He said I'm being heartless and that his daughter could have died. I told him his daughter is a thief and this whole situation could have Been avoided if she just brought her own lunch. The tension at work is insane now. People avoid me in the hallways. Nobody sits with me at lunch anymore. Even Beth, who gave me pizza that day, has been weird and distant. My boss sends me passive aggressive emails about office conduct and respecting co workers. It's gotten so bad that I'm genuinely thinking about quitting. Just heard about everything and offered me a full time position at the restaurant. The pay is slightly less, but at least I wouldn't have to deal with this drama every single day. Part of me feels like I shouldn't have to leave my job over this, but another part of me knows it's only gonna get worse.

Then she took a deep breath and started playing let it go from frozen. But she played it badly. Really badly. Wrong notes everywhere. Completely off rhythm. But she was smiling. For the first time in months, my daughter was smiling. She even started singing along quietly, forgetting hundreds of people were watching. The judges looked confused. The audience shifted uncomfortably as the terrible music assaulted their ears. Vince turned white, then red, then purple. And I swore I saw fumes coming out of his head. She finished with a flourish, stood up and actually took a bow. The scattered, confused applause was the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard. Vince exploded in the parking lot. You told her to do that? He was right. But I didn't care anymore. Three months of my time, my money. I lost $50,000 because of you. He grabbed Lynette's shoulders. You're done with piano? Done. I'm selling it tomorrow. That's when Lynette said something that changed everything. Good, she said, looking him straight in the eye. I hate piano now. You made me hate the thing I loved. Most, she pulled out her little notebook where she used to write songs. I wanted to compose music when I grew up, like the Disney movies. But now I can't even listen to piano without feeling sick. She threw the notebook in the trash. Thanks for ruining my dream, daddy. The silence that followed was deafening. Even Vince seemed stunned.

She'd sit at the piano like a robot, playing the same advanced piece over and over. Her little fingers could barely reach all the keys.

His face went from confused to horrified in, like, two seconds. He got up, walked fast to the break room, and I followed at a distance. He dumped the coffee in the sink, rinsed the mug under the water for maybe five seconds, and then just left it there and walked out. He grabbed his jacket and left the office. Just straight up went home early. People were still complaining about the smell for the rest of the day. Someone opened all the windows. Facilities came by to check the vents. One guy said it smelled like a corpse microwaved in fish oil, which honestly was the most accurate description I'd heard all day. Nobody could figure out where it was coming from, because by then, the mug was just sitting in the sink, and the smell had kind of spread everywhere. I waited until everyone went home, washed my mug with actual soap this time, and took it back to my desk, put it in my drawer. The next day, Mark came in with a paper cup from the coffee shop downstairs. And the day after that, and the day after that, he never touched the kitchen mugs again. I started leaving mine back on the shelf after a Week and he wouldn't even look at it.

First time it happened I figured maybe he didn't know it was mine, so I just washed it and put it back. Second time I was annoyed but didn't say anything. Third time I walked up to him in the break room and said, hey man, that's actually my mug. Could you not use it? He looked at me, smiled like I just told the dumbest joke ever, and said, dude, it just a mug. Then he turned around and walked back to his desk with his coffee still in my mug. I asked him two more times that week. Same response every time. Just a mug. No big deal. Stop being weird about it. One time he even said, maybe don't leave it in a shared space then, which pissed me off because literally everyone leaves their mugs there and nobody steals them except him. So I decided I was done asking. That Friday after work, I took the mug home. I stopped at the grocery store on the way and grabbed a can of the

Three months later, I saw her wedding announcement with my face photoshopped into every picture. I found the post around midnight while scrolling through Craigslist gigs because my car payment was due and I was $200 short. The listing said, need male actor for family dinner. Must be comfortable with light PDA and convincing backstory. $400 cash for four hours. I've done stranger jobs before. This seemed easy. I texted the number and got a response immediately. The woman who walked in was maybe 28, with shoulder length blonde hair and nervous energy. Her name was Sophia and she needed a fake boyfriend for her sister's engagement party that weekend. Her entire family had been pressuring her about being single while her younger sister was getting married. She pulled out 4 hundred dollar bills, half now, half after. She's spent the next hour drilling me on our fake relationship back story. We've been dating for eight months after meeting at a bookstore. She made me memorize her birthday, her favorite foods, her cat's names. She warned me that her brother in law, Daniel, was suspicious, would try to trip me up. Saturday arrived and I showed up wearing the button down shirt Sophia had requested. She grabbed my hand, her palm sweaty. Just remember, we're in love and you think my family is great. The restaurant was expensive, Mom. Catherine stood up and Pulled Sophia into a hug, then turned to me with an assessing look. So you're the mystery boyfriend. The interrogation started immediately. Catherine wanted to know where I grew up, what my parents did, my five year plan. Sophia's dad Gerald asked about my job and income. It felt like a job interview. I stuck to the backstory. About an hour in, Daniel started asking pointed questions about how we met. He wanted specifics. I stayed calm and described a bookstore I actually visited regularly, the dinner drag.

Dried it off real good so it looked totally normal and clean. Then I put it back on the shelf in the kitchen like nothing happened. I got to work early that day just to make sure I could watch. Around 9, Mark walked into the break room, grabbed my mug without even looking, poured himself some coffee, and went back to his desk. I waited. By 10:30, people started walking around sniffing the air. Someone said it smelled like something died in the vents. Another person thought maybe the fridge was broken and something was rotting inside. I heard Mark's desk neighbor asked him if He smelled it, too, and he said, yeah, it was disgusting. Around 11, I walked past his desk to grab something from the printer, and I swear to god, he looked green. Like, actually nauseous.

Dimitri looked uncomfortable. Maybe we should just get your things. Nadine, no. Tell him you're gay. Long pause, then quietly, I can't do that. My wife gets back next week. Needs to stop. The locksmith showed up right then. I opened the door just wide enough to point at her stuff, take it, and go. She tried tears. We didn't do anything yet.

She started a social media campaign claiming I invented Dimitri's marriage to Tik Toks about gaslighting boyfriend. Then she got cocky, posted a story from Dimitri's apartment Sunday night. Wine glasses. Netflix tagged the location. Elena's friends saw it. Monday, Elena called me. We met at a coffee shop. I want to thank you for having the balls to end it. Elena went nuclear on Facebook. Posted wedding photos, marriage certificate, screenshots of Dimitri admitting everything. Caption for anyone confused about my husband's sexuality or marital Status Dimitri is straight, married for now, and hosting sleepovers with someone else's girlfriend. It went viral. Nadine tried damage control, but Dimitri cracked, posted his own statement. I'm not gay. I'm married. I betrayed my wife's trust by allowing Nadine to use my sexuality as a cover for our inappropriate friendship. Nadine lost it in the comments. What are you doing? We agreed to the story! You're ruining everything! She admitted to the lie publicly. Screenshot by dozens of people. Elena filed for divorce, found out the affair had been going on over a year since before Nadine and I even started dating. Adene used me as a job reference without asking. Three companies called. She listed you as someone who can speak to her character. She convinced me her married male friend was gay so she could have sleepovers at his house. She didn't get any of the jobs.

Supplied flour to half the bakeries in town, and had this incredibly patient way of explaining heritage wheat varieties. We started meeting for coffee before market set up, but really, we were just building something beautifully uncomplicated together. Looking at the context in the section you want revised, here's a more dramatic version. One random Wednesday afternoon, while Luke and I were testing recipes for a new sourdough blend in my tiny kitchen, someone started pounding on my apartment door like they for trying to break it down. I opened it to find my aunt standing there, her face flushed and desperate. She'd somehow tracked me down after six months of nothing. Don't you dare close this door, she said, pushing past me into my kitchen. Tanya's marriage lasted three hours. Three hours. Cecil absolutely lost it at the reception about the cake flavor being wrong. Started screaming at her in front of 200 guests. Called her stupid, worthless, pathetic. Sound familiar? He grabbed her wrist so hard it left bruises. Shook her while she sobbed in her wedding dress. Her dad had to physically pull him off while everyone just sat there horrified. She breathing hard, staring at me like I should be saying something. The whole family knows you were right. Now, Tanya has been staying with your parents for two weeks, crying constantly. She keeps saying she should have believed you. Good for her. I said flatly, going, Back to my dough. My aunt grabbed my arm. Are you seriously this cold? Tanya needs you. She's going through exactly what you went through. No, I said pulling away. When I went through it, I had to do it alone because my whole family called me dramatic. Tanya called me jealous. You all picked him. We made a mistake. You made a choice. Interrupted setting down his dough. You had photos of bruises. You had voice mails. You had proof. You chose not to believe her. My aunt turned on him. Who the hell are you to judge us? You don't know our family. I know enough, Luke said calmly. I know you called her dramatic and jealous. I know you blocked her on social media when she tried to warn you Tanya was in love. We thought you thought I was lying, I said quietly. Even with evidence, even with bruises. You thought I was making it up for attention. My aunt's face crumpled. We want to make it right. Tanya needs her cousin. She needs someone who understands. She had someone who understood. She chose Cecil instead. Please. Your mother cries every night. Your father can keep crying. I finished. I have work to do.

Hopefully one day he'll find someone special, too. When he's ready. No rush, tiger. That's when Vanessa's new husband, Nate cleared his throat and approached our table. He looked directly at me, his eyes curious and grateful. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I couldn't let tonight pass without saying something. The reception quieted as he continued, his voice carrying across the room. I need to thank you properly in front of everyone. My mom laughed nervously, patting my head. Oh, that's sweet, Nate, but what could? Our little. You saved my father's life, Nate said firmly, his voice cracking slightly. Two months ago, when every other surgeon said the tumor was inoperable. The silence was deafening. My dad's champagne glass stopped midway to his lips. There must be some confusion, Aunt Linda interjected from the next table. You can't mean. Nate pulled out his phone, showing a photo of him and his father at the hospital. Doctor Jane here performed a 16 hour surgery that three other neurosurgeons wouldn't even attempt. The nursing staff called him a miracle worker. My mother's hand, which I've been stroking, my hair froze completely. He's. He's a doctor. Nate nodded. Head of neurosurgery at Presbyterian. Youngest department head in the hospital's history. You didn't know the kids. Table suddenly felt like it was under a spotlight. My seven year old cousin looked up from her coloring book. Wait, you're a brain doctor? But my mom said you still lived in your parents basement playing video games. The crowd started murmuring, phones coming out, probably googling my name. My brother Todd's face had gone pale. But. But I gave him Pokemon cards for Christmas last year. I tried to tell you, I said quietly, standing up from the kids table and straightening my tie multiple times. But every time I mentioned the hospital, you assumed I meant volunteering at the gift shop. I paused, looked around to make sure everyone was listening, and told them once and for all. I haven't lived at home in 10 years. I have a penthouse apartment and a vacation home in Aspen. That night, I received 17 apology texts, 12 LinkedIn requests from relatives, and three offers to catch up over coffee.

For 10 years, I've hosted the Meat Extravaganza, a legendary backyard BBQ where friends and family compete for trophies, best sauce, best brisket, best ribs. Everyone marks their calendars months in advance. Two days before the event, my brother drops a bomb. He's bringing his new vegan girlfriend and expects me to create an entire vegan menu for her. I'm all for accommodating people, but this is literally called the meat extravaganza. The invitations have cartoon steaks on them. I half jokingly suggested she could eat the garnishes, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles off the burgers. My brother exploded, called me rude and exclusionary. I reminded him this tradition has been the same for a decade, and asking me to add a full vegan spread 48 hours before was insane. I offered a compromise. She could bring her own food, and I'd set up a separate grill just for her. Clean greats, dead kated space, everything she'd need. He got more offended, said I was segregating her food and making her an outsider. At this point, I'm losing my mind because I genuinely tried to accommodate someone I never even met. My dad said I should just bend the rules this once. That pushed me over the edge. I snapped that I'd done enough, and if she wanted to come, she could lick the lettuce off my plate. When I Was done. My brother's face turned purple. He marched outside to where I'd spent three hours setting up my grill station and put it upside down. Charcoal everywhere, plates shattered, perfectly seasoned meat in the dirt. I didn't get angry, I just started laughing. The whole thing was so absurdly childish. After he stormed off, I cleaned up and formed a plan. A beautiful, petty plan. I went to the store and bought realistic plant based burger patties and regular beef patties that looked almost identical when my plan was simple but perfect. Barbecue day arrives. Weather's perfect, grill is smoking, everyone's having an amazing time. Three hours in, there's this weird tension because my brother and his girlfriend still haven't shown up. People kept asking if they were actually coming. Finally, a bright green prius pulls into my driveway, outsteps my brother and his girlfriend.

No, I said. I'm not paying back anything. My dad's face turned red. Excuse me? I got accepted to three universities last month. All of them offered me full academic scholarships. I never needed your money anyway. The room went completely silent. My mom whispered, you applied to colleges? Yeah. You never asked. I walked upstairs, packed a bag and called my aunt. She picked me up at night, and I've been living with her ever since. My parents have called me 67 times. I haven't answered once.

I've arranged tasks that must be completed before the full estate terms are implemented. Amanda, the envelope contains the key to my lakehouse. Go there immediately. And remember, things aren't always as they appear. Sometimes a single dollar is worth more than millions. Mom's mask cracked. Amanda will naturally accompany. No, I interrupted. Grandpa said I go alone. At the lakehouse, I found his study unlocked. Inside, a notebook detailing his true holdings. Over $24 million. A letter to me to investigate Riley Innovations. Within hours, I uncovered everything. In the 1990s, Grandpa had founded a tech company with revolutionary patents. My father, handling legal work, advised him a competing patent would make it worthless. He recommended immediate sale. Grandpa sold for a fraction of its value. Six months later, the buyer made billions using his designs. No competing patent ever emerged. The most damning detail. Mom worked in acquisitions at the buying company. They orchestrated the theft together, pocketing nearly half a million in hidden fees. Grandpa discovered the truth five years ago. That's when he restructured everything. When I confronted my parents at the lake house with the documents, dad turned pale. Mom recovered quickly. That was ancient history. Business is Complicated, then a courier arrived with Grandpa's final letter. The will reading was a

My dad added that since my sister would be taking over his company someday, she needed to get a customs to the lifestyle. They genuinely believed she was their golden ticket to the future. But here's the thing. My sister was failing almost every class. Our school sent letters home constantly about her grades, but my parents never checked. They just believed whatever she told them. Meanwhile, I was going straight A's because I felt guilty that they were spending $60,000 a year on private school for both of us. I studied every night while my sister went out with her rich friends. Last month, everything blew up. My parents announced they were leaving town for a week for some business. This conference. They left us $150 for food and emergencies. That was it. The day after they left, my sister came home furious. Apparently, one of her friends had been showing off her designer watch collection at lunch. And my sister couldn't stand that someone had something she didn't. She spent the next two days asking all her friends about watches and researching brands online. Then She came into my room and said, I know where dad keeps his credit cards. Should I borrow one? I looked at her like she was insane. Are you serious? No. Absolutely not. If you want something that expensive, call dad and ask him. She rolled her eyes. What's the worst that can happen? I'll just say it was an emergency. I shook my head. Do whatever you want, but keep me completely out of it. I'm not covering for you this time. She left my room, and 10 minutes later, I heard her scream from downstairs. I got it. My stomach dropped.

So I'm now refusing to pay her private school tuition. My twin sister was born three minutes after me, but you'd think she arrived on a golden chariot. Our parents were told during delivery that the second baby might not survive. The doctor said the chances were slim. So when my sister made it, my parents literally called her the Chosen One and treated her like a miracle. Ever since. Growing up, we shared everything. Birthdays, a room, even friends. But the differences were impossible to ignore. On our 16th birthday, my parents threw this massive party in our backyard. Everyone was there. Family, neighbors, kids from school. When it was time for presents, my dad walked my sister outside with his hands over her eyes, sitting in the driveway with a brand new white BMW with a giant red bow on top. Everyone started cheering and taking photos. My sister was screaming and crying happy tears. I stood there holding a gift bag with three shirts from target. I tried to stay positive. I walked up to my mom and quietly asked if the car there was a gift for both of us to share. The entire party went silent. Everyone turned to stare at my mom, waiting for her answer. She looked around nervously, then said really loud, yes, of course, sweetie. It's for both of you. My sister heard that and completely Lost it. She started screaming, no, it's not! And slamming the car door over and over. My dad rushed over and pulled her aside. I watched him whisper something in her ear, and instantly she calmed down.

My parents laughed while handing my sister $6.9 million. Me? They gave me $1 and said, go earn your own. My mother smirked. Some kids just don't measure up. But when the lawyer read Grandpa's final letter, my mom started screaming. I never expected to watch my sister Caroline receive everything while I got humiliated with a single dollar. My grandfather Maxwell had been my hero, my only ally in a family that treated me like a disappointment. Caroline was the Golden Child. Business school, perfect posture, country club connections. I chose environmental science. That won't pay for the lifestyle you're accustomed to, mom would say with disgust. Grandpa was different. We fish at his lake house, while my family located in Europe. The world needs people who care about its future more than its stock market, he'd tell me. When he got cancer two years ago, my parents suddenly became attentive. Expensive gifts, frequent visits. Their concern matched his net worth exactly. I just brought homemade soup and sat with him. During one of our last visits, he squeezed my hand. Remember, timing is everything. The truth always rises to the surface. At the funeral, mom networked with his former colleagues. Caroline's makeup stayed flawless through precisely two tears. I stood alone by the photo display I'd arranged. The will reading was worse than I imagined. Mom got the Beacon Hill mansion. Caroline got six point nine million dollars in a trust. Then to Amanda Grace Riley, I leave one dollar. The room went silent. Mom laughed. Well, that's clarifying. Always the disappointment. Mr. Langford handed me a thick envelope.

They can take her office. I'm giving her computer stuff to Evan. She spends too much time on it anyway. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. He was planning to give away my two thousand dollar setup that I'd worked years to afford without even asking me. I grabbed his iPad the next morning after he left for work. It was unlocked and there was a family group chat open. My hands were shaking as I read through the messages. Matt had been planning this for weeks. Parents were selling their house. They'd be moving in at the end of the month. His mom even made a joke about selling my desk set up since she won't be needing an office anyway, she travels for work so much. They were laughing about it, making plans to convert my space into a bedroom. Matt said I'd get over it eventually and that I was too focused on work anyway. I felt sick. This was my home too. And he was planning to completely dismantle my life without even having the decency to discuss. Sit with me. So today I told my manager I wasn't feeling well and left work at noon. I drove home with my heart hounding. I unlocked a door as quietly as possible. And then I heard it. Voices in my office. Male voices. I walked down the hall and pushed open the door. There was Matt, his dad and his brother. Evan. My monitors were already disconnected. My desk was halfway disassembled. Everything was being loaded into boxes labeled storage. And, Evan, they all froze when they saw me. Matt's face went white. His dad had the audacity to smile and say, oh, hey, we wanted to surprise you. We're helping Matt's parents move in. Isn't that exciting? I looked at Matt, just stared at him. And then I said the only thing I could think of. Get out of my house.

He immediately found the receipt, and his face went red. He started yelling about how irresponsible I was being with money, how we could have used that for something practical, how I was being selfish. I just stared at him. Then I said, Matt, I make $180,000 a year here. Now this is 1% of my salary. His mouth dropped open. He had no idea. I guess I forgot to mention the exact number when I told him about the job. From that moment on, he gave me complete silence. Wouldn't talk to me at breakfast, wouldn't respond to my texts, would leave the room when I walked in. It was like living with a ghost. But then things got weirder. My stuff started disappearing. First, it was my favorite hoodie from college. I asked Matt about it, and he said he donated it because it was old and ratty. I was annoyed, but didn't think much of it. Then my running shoes vanished. He said he gave them to his brother. They were $150 shoes I'd bought two months ago. Next was my expensive noise cancelling headphones. I use them for work calls. When I asked where they were, Matt casually said his dad needed headphones, so he gave them to him. I told him he couldn't just take my stuff without asking. He shrugged and said, you make enough money to replace them. I was furious, but Didn't want to fight. I just bought new ones. One night last week, I woke up around 2:00am. Matt wasn't in bed. I could hear him talking on the phone in the living room. I stayed quiet and listened. He was talking to his sister, and what I heard made my blood run cold. Yeah? I'm moving mom and dad in next month. He said she doesn't know yet, but she'll deal with it. We've got three rooms. One is mine, one is hers.

This happened three weeks ago, and I still can't get the feeling of that cold water running down my back out of my mind. We were making dinner together. Just simple canned chili, nothing fancy. She asked me to chop some onions to add to it. I thought it was straightforward enough. I've chopped onions before. I'm not completely useless in the kitchen. I was standing at the counter, carefully cutting them up, trying to make sure they were decent sized. She walked by to check on the chili and suddenly stopped. Her whole mood shifted instantly. What are you doing? Those are way too coarse. They're supposed to be much smaller than that. I looked down at what I've done. They seemed fine to me. But I said, okay, I can fix it. She got more upset. No, you already ruined it. You put them in the pot already. The chili is messed up now. I tried explaining that they were just sitting on top. I could scoop them out easily with a spoon, cut them smaller and put them back in. No big deal. But she just pushed me out of the way and grabbed the knife from my hand. I let go immediately. My self esteem has been pretty much non existent for a while now. So I just back. I started saying that I did exactly what she asked me to do. And if she'd wanted them added at the end as a garnish instead of during cooking, she should have just told me that. I wish I could do something, anything, right for once. I walked to the bedroom feeling pathetic. I'm 28 years old, and apparently I can't even make canned chili correctly. I sat on the bed, trying to stay out of her way so she could fix whatever I'd supposedly destroyed. A few minutes later, she brought dinner in on a tray. I was ready to just drop the whole thing and move on. We both both ate quietly. She only finished about half of her food before taking it back to the kitchen. I apologized again, multiple times, trying to smooth things over. She didn't respond, just stared at me with this look. So I tried to explain my side, that maybe the communication could have been clear about exactly how she wanted those onions prepared and when to add them. That's when she cut me off. You're not listening to me. You keep interrupting. I genuinely didn't understand. I thought we were taking turns talking. I was desperately trying to stay calm.

Her kids need their sleep. They've been so fussy lately. I stared at my mother for a long moment. This woman who raised me, who I called every Sunday, who I'd been there for through everything. Okay, I said quietly, we'll go. Great. Amber called out as I turned away. Come back around four. Maybe four, 4:30. We should be done eating by then. We walked back to the car. My husband Greg was gripping the steering wheel so hard, his knuckles were white. He heard everything through the open windows. We're leaving, I told him. He didn't argue, just started the car. The kids cried for the first Stour. My daughter kept asking why grandma didn't want to see them. My son asked if they'd done something wrong. I had no answers that wouldn't break their little hearts. Greg was silent, but I could see the anger radiating off him. We got home around 5 p m. I ordered pizza, put on a movie, tuck them in early, both of them still sniffling. Then I went to my office and opened my laptop. I wrote two emails. One to mom, one to Amber. Subject line. Family expectations. I didn't yell, I didn't curse. I just listed facts. Every Christmas where Amber's kids opened presents first while mine waited. Every birthday party where we were asked to come late or leave early so Amber's kids wouldn't be overwhelmed. Every family photo where we were positioned in The back or dropped out entirely. Every single time, they chose her over us. I ended with one sentence. Don't contact me unless you're ready to apologize to my children's faces. I hit send at 11:17 p m. My phone started buzzing at 11:19. Amber 1st. Are you serious right now? You're acting insane, mom. Two minutes later. This is very hurtful. We were just trying to keep the peace. My aunt at 11:32. Your mother is crying. What did you say to her? I forwarded every single defensive, angry message to our family group chat. Every excuse, every dismissal, every time they called me dramatic or sensitive. Then I posted one message. This is why we won't be attending family events anymore. Screenshot saved for when my kids are old enough to ask why. And I left the group. By morning, I had 67 messages across text, voicemail, and social media. Mom's final voicemail was what did it. You're being incredibly dramatic. We just needed some buy it. Amber's children are more delicate than yours. You should understand that. I saved that voicemail. One day, my kids will ask why we stopped seeing grandma, and I'll let them listen to her explain how they weren't worthy inconvenience.

We don't want your children disturbing them. My sister added, I hope you don't take it seriously. I packed the car silently while my children cried. I'm 34, married, with two kids ages 8 and 5. My sister Amber is 29 with three kids under 7. We've always had a complicated relationship, but I never thought it would come to this. We left our house at 11:00am. Three hour drive to Mom's Place. The kids were so excited they could barely sit still. My daughter had made grandma a card. My son kept asking if Cousin Sam would share his new race car set. We brought homemade pies, wine for the adults, and a box of games for all the kids to play together. Normal Thanksgiving stuff. Mom told us to arrive at 2 p m. Sharp. We knocked at 2:03. She opened the door with this panicked expression I'd never seen before. Oh no, you can't come in right now. I laughed, thinking she was joking. What? Amber's kids are napping. They had such a rough night, we can't risk waking them. You'll need to wait in the car. I stared at her. Wait in the car, mom, it's Thanksgiving. We drove three hours. I know, honey, but Amber's been having such a difficult time. The kids were up all night. She really needs them to sleep. That's when Amber appeared behind, her hair perfectly curled full Makeup, dressed like she was going to a photo shoot, not like someone dealing with exhausted, cranky children. Hey, sis, she said cheerfully, I hope you don't take it seriously. It's just that my kids need their routine, you know? Maybe come back in, like, two hours. I looked past them into the house. Amber's husband was all on the couch in sweatpants, watching the ball. I could smell the Turkey roasting. The dining table was visible from the doorway by the settings. Not 7, not 9 5. My daughter tugged on my sleeve. Mommy, why can't we go inside? I need to use the bathroom. Amber's kids are sleeping. Sweetheart, I said, my voice somehow steady, we need to wait. But I really need to go. Amber shrugged, not even looking at my daughter. There's a gas station about 10 minutes down the road. They have bathrooms. My five year old started crying. I want to see grandma. You said we could see Grandma. Mom looked uncomfortable, but didn't step aside. I'm

When I was 13, my family moved from Texas to this tiny town in Ontario, Canada. I was super nervous about starting over at a new school, so I came up with what I thought was the most genius plan ever. On my first day, I walked into homeroom and introduced myself with the thickest, most ridiculous fake British accent you've ever heard. I told everyone I was from Birmingham, England, even though I had never even been on a plane before that moved to Canada. The accent was absolutely terrible, like a mix of Harry Potter and some random YouTube videos I'd watched the night before, but somehow it actually worked. At first all the kids thought I was so cool and worldly. They kept asking me to say random words just to hear my accent. I got invited to birthday parties, added to group chats, and even asked to sleepovers. Teachers loved having me share my global perspective in class. I had never gotten this much attention before in my entire life, and honestly, it was addictive. But keeping up the lie was exhausting. I had to remember to use the accent everywhere. In the hallways, talking to teachers, even when neighbors saw me outside. I would literally pretend to talk to my nan on the phone just to practice in public. Every night I'd stay up googling British slang and watching videos trying to Sound more natural. Then things got really bad. Halfway through the year, this new girl named Ella joined our class. She was sweet, funny, and had the most beautiful, natural British accent I'd ever heard. She was actually from Manchester. My heart.

Last Tuesday, I pulled over this brand new black BMW weaving through traffic on I ninety five guy was doing 85 and a 55, cutting people off like he owned the road. I hit my lights and he pulled over real dramatic like he was doing me a huge favor. Before I even got to his window, he rolled it down and started yelling, do you have any idea who I am? Real loud, making sure everyone driving by could hear him. I walked up calm, said good afternoon, explained why I stopped him. He cut me off and pulled out this thick leather wallet waving around some gold business card. I'm the president of Harrington Development. I built half the condos in this city. I stayed professional, told him he was going 30 over, nearly hit a Honda when he merged without looking. Instead of cooperating, he leans back and starts talking into his Bluetooth. Yeah, some cops wasting my time. Hold the meeting. Then he turns to me and goes, write your little ticket, but you'll be out of a job before lunch. I asked for his license, registration and insurance. He threw them at me through the window, rolled his eyes. It's a demo car. They let me take it. Do you know how many Bmws I've bought? I walked back to my cruiser and ran everything. That's when things got Interesting, the plates came back registered to Bavarian Motors, not to him. Insurance didn't match either. So I called. The dealership manager picks up, and I explain, I've got someone here claiming to have permission to drive their demo vehicle. There's this long pause, then he goes, that car has been missing for two days.

Here we go. Number one, they should not allow topless sunbathing on the beach. It was very distracting for my husband, who just wanted to relax. On my holiday to India, I was disgusted to find that almost every restaurant served curry. I don't like spicy food. We went on holiday to Spain and had a problem with the taxi drivers as they were all Spanish. We booked an excursion to a water park, but no one told us we had to bring our own swimsuits and towels. We assumed it would be included in the price. The beach was too sandy. We had to clean everything. When we returned to our room, well, we found the sand was not like the sand in the brochure. Your sand show. The sand is white, but it was more yellow. It's lazy for the shopkeepers to close in the afternoon. I often needed to buy things during siesta time. This should be banned. No one told us there would be fish in the water. The children were scared. Although the brochure said there was a fully equipped kitchen, there was no egg slicer in the drawers. I think it should be explained in the brochure that the local convenience stores does not sell proper biscuits like custard creams and ginger nuts. The roads were uneven and bumpy, so we could not read the local guidebook during the bus. Ride to the resort. Because of this, we were unaware of many things that would have made our holiday more fun. It took us nine hours to fly home from Jamaica to England. It took the Americans only three hours to get home. This seems unfair. I compared the size of our one bedroom suite to our friends three bedroom and ours was significantly smaller. The brochure stated no hairdressers at the resort. We're trainee hairdressers. And we think they knew and made us wait longer for service. I don't even want to act out the next one, but I'm gonna read it. When we were in Spain, there were too many Spanish people there. The receptionist spoke Spanish, the food was Spanish. No one told us that there would be so many foreigners. Really? We had to line up outside to catch the boat. And there was no air conditioning. Come on! It is your duty as a tour operator to advise us on noisy and unruly guests before we travel. I was bitten by a mosquito. The brochure did not mention mosquitoes. Come on, people, really? Get ready for the last one, cause this one. My fiance and I requested twin beds when we booked, but instead we were placed in a room with a king bed.

Cause this week, Tennessee's quarterback Nico Ealy, had a holdout because he wanted more NIL money. And it was just reported this morning that Tennessee is gonna be moving on from the guy. So basically, here's what's happening this year. Nico was slated to make $2.4 million from Tennessee's collective. But apparently that wasn't enough for Nico. And he saw Carson Beck go from Georgia to Florida, and he's getting 4 million. So basically, stopped showing up to practice and meetings and was holding out hoping that Tennessee would give him four million dollars. Long story short, Tennessee said no. I mean, to be fair, Nico, like Tennessee's mascot, is the volunteers. He kind of knew what you signed up for. All jokes aside, though, this is kind of an insane move. And to me, the only logical explanation behind this is that Nico's camp just thinks he's not gonna succeed in the NFL, so they're trying to get him as much money as possible. Right?

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you want to know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by 4, and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is, Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of it. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man, Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string they got Trey Lance. If you remember a couple seconds ago I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush. And Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt, and although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the snaps, he'll get another 200.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you wanna know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by four, and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is, Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to Cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of him. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man, Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush. And Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt, and although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully, Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sits At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55%

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you wanna know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by four and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to Cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of him. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand.

And that viral video was even liked by Lamar Jackson. But NFL fans really didn't like this move, so they decided to ruin this guy's life. They first found his Facebook page where it listed his job. And once that happened, everyone else started chiming in with their stories about it. Like this guy saying, I knew this kid throughout high school. He's a total piece of shit. Got kicked out of three different Baltimore private schools. And a notable moment was his expulsion from Saint Paul's for putting his hmm on a kid with special needs.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you wanna know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by four and then multiply it by 7 again.

This mom is adjusting to her new normal after losing her hands and legs because of all things, a dog lick. Marie Trainer woke up from a 10 day coma to find her limbs had been amputated. She cried the hardest I ever cried in my life. The life changing tragedy had its origins during a vacation in the Caribbean with her husband. Marie says she was using her key card to access her hotel when she accidentally nicked herself on her wrist. It was a tiny little scratch, a silly accident. It hardly hurt. When Marie came home, her dog Taylor greeted her with lots of kisses. But the dog also licked Marie's scratch. Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders. It turns out that her dog's saliva carried a bacteria called capnocytophaga. It's quite common in dogs, but what happened to Marie is a very rare occurrence. Her husband Matthew is doing his best to lift her spirits. I love her to death. She's everything to me.

Judge Kevin Mullins was shot and killed by the town sheriff in front of the camera in his office. He once turned the prison in Lectora County into a brothel to satisfy his and his nauseating friends filthy fantasies. Bollen's and his friends organized such parties in the county prison and other buildings in town, selecting the female prisoners they wanted. As a reward for these women, he will shorten their sentences or alleviate any punishment they face. If these women are unwilling to participate or refuse, he will threaten them, either sentencing them to the maximum sentence or kicking them to their most painful place. On March 12th, Sheriff Marshall was invited to a party and discovered that his wife and daughter were also involved. His wife was beaten by Mullins for disobedience and Sheriff Marshall angrily questioned Mullins before taking his wife and daughter home. Two days later, his daughter ended her life due to her inability to accept reality. Furious, Marshall rushed into Mullins's office, pulled out his weapon and fired three shots in a row. He died before the police arrived. Now Marshall is accused of first degree murder. He may never see his family again. Do you think he is a hero or a criminal?

According to the surveillance footage, Corey was running wildly on the treadmill and was thrown off six times in a row, each time facing down. However, his father was watching from the side. Not only did he not stop his son, but he also forced him to keep running on it. Corey's mother said that after Corey got home, he kept reporting that he was not feeling well, but Gregor didn't care. A few days later, Corey had difficulty breathing and an epileptic seizure. The doctor took rescue measures, but ultimately failed to save Corey's life. Court documents stated that Corey's deceased was due to a blunt impact on the chest and abdomen, followed by a torn liver. It was determined that it was caused by a fall while running. In court, Gregor stated that he had not harmed his son. After the judge watched the surveillance footage, he angrily sentenced him to 25 years in prison.

Alma is a bodybuilder and figured if she kept fighting, her attacker would get tired and give up. That was my, you know, thought the entire time. Cause the more fight you put in, I do believe they would get more tired cause they see that dang, this girl is fighting, you know, and you can see at the end of the video he was tired.

This mom is adjusting to her new normal after losing her hands and legs because of all things, a dog lick. Marie Trainer woke up from a 10 day coma to find her limbs had been amputated. She cried the hardest I ever cried in my life. The life changing tragedy had its origins during a vacation in the Caribbean with her husband. Marie says she was using her key card to access her hotel when she accidentally nicked herself on her wrist. It was a tiny little scratch, a silly accident. It hardly hurt. When Marie came home, her dog Taylor greeted her with lots of kisses. But the dog also licked Marie's scratch. Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders. It turns out that her dog's saliva carried a bacteria called capnocytophaga. It's quite common in dogs, but what happened to Marie is a very rare occurrence. Her husband Matthew is doing his best to lift her spirits. I love her to death. She's everything to me.

But it might now be too late.

Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing, with many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all, many to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flicked with, even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house. And many allege the situation might be much worse than now.

Before we even got into the park, it cost me $30 just for parking. And even being a Florida resident, tickets for a family of five with one child under 10 was still $974. The rest of the family decided they want to go to dinner at Downtown Disney Springs. This place was my literal hell. Totally in. Two hundred and forty five dollars twenty seven cents. The grand total for our day was one thousand three hundred ninety one dollars. Ninety one cents. Kind of had a feeling it would go viral. It's very relatable. It's family friendly. Disney's always a hot topic and we're, we're all trying to pinch pennies. So that video was probably my therapy as I was going through the day. The kids were smiling, sometimes fighting in between the lines. Uh, my wife was having a grand old time. Meanwhile, mine was just swipe the card over and over and over. And it started with the tik get purchase and then it ran right into the parking and then it just was like a cash cow for the rest of the day.

I wanted to get home right away. Son who called her to ask why she didn't mention they were getting a new roof. She says she rushed home to see a work crew had removed almost all the shingles from her home. The roofers had the wrong address and were supposed to be doing a roofing job three doors away. Campbell says there were roofing materials everywhere. They didn't just remove the shingles. They left the mess everywhere. Um, sides of the house, backyard, debris, everything. When Campbell contacted the roofing company, they admitted they made a mistake and had the wrong house. She thought they would replace her roof and she was shocked when they said no. Campbell called the police, her insurance company and another roofing contractor who put down an emergency wrap on her house to protect the roof until it can be completed. The company that took off her roof by mistake is 5 Stars Roofing of Markham. We want to be responsible for what we did. We will do her roof for free. If she wants us to do it, we can schedule it.

A haunting viral video shows what allegedly appeared like the boy was cowering after being handed a box at a supermarket, with many parental experts saying it was not a flinch, but seemingly a brace for impact. Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing. With many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all, they may to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flicked, with even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be, but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house, and many allege the situation might be much worse now.

He died before the police arrived. Now Marshall is accused of first degree murder. He may never see his family again. Do you think he is a hero or a criminal?

A man forcibly dragged a woman behind the Monument and after a while she staggered away. This terrible scene happened to be witnessed by a person who was watching the Key West webcam. He lived 16 miles away in Boston and immediately called the Key West police. Thanks for calling from Boston, but bear with me. This is going to sound crazy, but I'm at work and I had the, you know, the southern most Red Point camp. Yeah, I could almost swear that I saw somebody get raped. The police report stated that the caller who made the long distance call to 9 1 1 happened to be watching a web cam at the time of the incident. It looked like she was fighting. She fell flat on her face. We were able to log into the cam and provide that video to the police department and the state's attorney's office. The police arrested the attacker, Carrie Calvin Gasog, 37 years old, who was an Uber driver. Justice in Key West has been upheld thanks to a sharp eyed citizen who was watching from afar in Boston. The suspect pleaded guilty to sexual assault charges and was sentenced to 10 years in prison just yesterday.

She said that she loves me. She's. She said that she wanted to date, but she couldn't let anyone know. Did Marissa make you lie about this? Yeah, plenty of times. She said, you have to lie or else I'm gonna have to go away. Chris remembers when his nanny told him she was having his baby. I was a little bit freaked. This photo shows him with his Newborn son, Bentley. For three years, Chris kept the secret. Chris finally came clean to his mother, Nadine. Mom, Bentley's really my kid. No, there's no way.

People were terrified after Tiktoker nurse Hannah and her family were allegedly ending the lives of their own young ones in front of us, with many claiming the boy has been calling us for help. But it might now be too late. A haunting viral video shows what allegedly appeared like the boy was cowering after being handed a box at a supermarket, with many parental experts saying it was not a flinch but seemingly a brace for impact. Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing, with many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all, many to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flicked with, even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house. And many allege the situation might be much worse than now.

As soon as I walked around the bar to go to the back, I noticed one employee sleeping there on that bar. Um, you know, I looked at her for a few seconds, and I thought about waking her up, but then I said, you know, this employee is probably tired. I got you, fam. I'll take care of it. So he walked to the kitchen and cooked himself a giant Texas bacon cheese steak melt. It was three a m. He gobbled the meal down and then left the Waffle House in West Columbia, South Carolina. Waffle House only became aware of what happened when he posted these photos on social media. Waffle House management was not happy suspending the sleeping employee, but adding, obviously, Alex has some cooking skills, and we'd like to talk to him about a job since we may have something for him. They haven't formally offered me a job yet. Um, the district manager reached out to me after this occurred, and he said he would like maybe for me to be a secret shopper. And do you think you'll take him up on that? Absolutely, ma'am. Waffle House for life, by the way. Alex tells us he did go back the next day, and he paid for his meal.

People were terrified after Tiktoker nurse Hannah and her family were allegedly ending the lives of their own young ones in front of us, with many claiming the boy has been calling us for help, but it might now be too late. A haunting viral video shows what allegedly appeared like the boy was cowering after being handed a box at a supermarket, with many parental experts saying it was not a flinch, but seemingly a brace for impact. Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing. With many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all, they may to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flicked, with even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be, but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house, and many allege the situation might be much worse now.

In court. She recalled the day three years ago when her stepfather cruelly killed her four year old brother James Andrew and threw him in the trash can outside their house. Stepfather often locks them in the bedroom to prevent them from entering the kitchen to eat. She often hears James crying. Once the girl sneaked into the kitchen and found four year old James lying motionless under a blue blanket. He immediately sent a message to her mother for help, but did not receive any response. Later she saw her stepfather put James in a black garbage bag and she never saw him again since then. Her 10 year old and seven year old brothers also testified in court telling the story of their stepfather not only brutally abusing James, also forcing them to live in fear, eating only once every three days and often being beaten by him. He also used children's toys such as airplane models and Spider Man dolls to beat James until he could no longer move. Whenever she and her brothers hear James crying, they feel extremely helpless and hopeless. The girl also mentioned that once James was caught stealing food by his stepfather because he was too hungry. Stepfather used the toys they usually played with as tools of violence and ultimately beat James to death. All of this has caused immense mental trauma to her and Her brothers. How many years do you think stepfather should be sentenced to for these terrible behaviors?

Campbell says there were roofing materials everywhere. They didn't just remove the shingles. They left the mess everywhere. Um, sides of the house, backyard, debris, everything. When Campbell contacted the roofing company, they admitted they made a mistake and had the wrong house. She thought they would replace her roof and she was shocked when they said no. Campbell called the police, her insurance company and another roofing contractor who put down an emergency wrap on her house to protect the roof until it can be completed.

Judge Kevin Mullins was shot and killed by the town sheriff in front of the camera in his office. He once turned the prison in Lectora County into a brothel to satisfy his and his nauseating friends filthy fantasies. Bollen's and his friends organized such parties in the county prison and other buildings in town, selecting the female prisoners they wanted. As a reward for these women, he will shorten their sentences or alleviate any punishment they face. If these women are unwilling to participate or refuse, he will threaten them, either sentencing them to the maximum sentence or kicking them to their most painful place. On March 12, Sheriff Marshall was invited to a party and discovered that his wife and daughter were also involved. His wife was beaten by Mullins for disobedience and Sheriff Marshall angrily questioned Mullins before taking his wife and daughter home. Two days later, his daughter ended her life due to her inability to accept reality. Furious, Marshall rushed into Mullins's office, pulled out his weapon and fired three shots in a row. He died before the police arrived. Now Marshall is accused of first degree murder. He may never see his family again. Do you think he is a hero or a criminal?

I slept in two years. When the police searched the residence of singer David Burke, they found bloodstains. Evidence suggests that David got Celeste Rivas pregnant before she was killed. During the search of David's residence, the authorities focused on finding bloodstains and investigating the possibility that Celeste was killed there. The police conducted a search at the home rented by David's agent and ultimately took away a computer and several items. It was reported that a figure resembling Celeste appeared in one of David's music videos. Another image showed Celeste in the backstage area with David's brother wearing her signature Hello Kitty Crocs. A Twitch live stream featuring both David and Celest was also exposed, in which David repeatedly asked the moderator to delete all clips and live stream replays. Photo also circulated online and TMZ said it had investigated the photo and found that the location in the photo was only a six minute walk from where Celeste lived before she went missing a year ago. All the evidence points to David Burke. May Celeste rest in peace.

Portland, Oregon became my destination. Clean slate where nobody knew my story. Meanwhile, she discovered reality. Landlords don't accept I'm going to be a doctor payment. When the electricity shut off three days later, she finally understood that I hadn't been dead weight. I've been the foundation. Her texts started week one, calls began week two. 27. In one day, I deleted every message, unread every call, go to voicemail. By month three, she'd hired a private investigator. I landed a construction management job, bought a house with a yard, joined a hiking group, started dating a graphic designer who had her own career and actually seemed interested in my thoughts. After a year, I proposed. Three years after that parking lot, she tracked me down through medical database records, showed up at my work, my house, even got police called for trespassing. She cornered me at Home Depot on a Saturday afternoon. Please just give me five minutes. For what? To apologize, to ask for another chance. You had eight years of chances. You use them all up in a parking lot. I was stressed. I said things I didn't mean. I've regretted it every single day. Which part do you regret? Calling me? Dead weight. Discovering that dead weight was keeping your life afloat. She tried explaining how hard residency had been, but she realized she'd given up the best thing in Her life. So when you thought you'd be wealthy and successful, you threw me away. Now that reality hit and you're struggling, suddenly I'm the best thing that ever happened to you. I love you. I've all always loved you. I'm engaged. We're getting married in September. The words hit her like a physical blow. Two weeks later, she showed up at my workplace claiming a medical emergency. I handed her two things, a restraining order and a wedding invitation. I want you to understand that I'm not just moving on from you. I've already moved on completely. Six months later, I married my fiance. My ex wife wanted a fresh start with no dead weight. I gave her exactly that.

I signed them without argument and disappeared so completely that three years later, she was still searching. Eight years of working double shifts to pay her medical school tuition, eight years of frozen dinners, canceled vacations and being told once I graduate, everything will be different. The graduation ceremony was on a Thursday in may. I took the day off work, bought a new shirt. This was supposed to be our moment, our achievement, our future finally beginning. When they called her name, I stood up and clapped harder than anyone else. The ceremony ended around noon. I waited by the car while she posed with classmates. That diploma clutched like a golden ticket. When she finally walked over, I expected a hug. Instead, she handed me a vanilla envelope. Divorce papers, she said, like she was discussing the weather. I already signed my part. This wasn't a spur of the moment decision. This was planned. Look, I don't need you anymore. I have my degree, job offers, future. You were helpful during school, but that chapter is over. No dead weight. Eight years of marriage reduced to two words, helpful and dead weight. Her colleagues were gathering around us watching. I open the envelope. Everything already filled out. Assets divided, apartment claimed. Then I did something that surprised everyone. I pulled out a pen and signed every page right there in the Parking lot. I ended our marriage with the same casualness she'd started this conversation there. Congratulations on your graduation and your divorce. Her mouth drop popped open. She'd expected drama, begging anger. You're not going to fight this. Why would I fight for someone who just called me dead weight? I walked away from the car, leaving her standing there with her diploma in one hand and our signed divorce papers in the other. Three days later, I was gone from the state. The beauty of being married to someone who never paid attention to finances. She had no idea what I controlled. The apartment she thought she was getting. Lease in my name only paid for my personal account for two years. I closed our joint.

So this is Max McGee. And in 1967, he was a 34 year old backup wide receiver for the Green Bay Packers. He only had four receptions all year, and he planned on retiring after the season. So the night before Super Bowl won in Los Angeles between the Chiefs and Packers. Max wasn't worried about getting rest before the big game. He wanted to go party. So after the final eleven PM room check, he snuck out of the hotel and went out with two flight attendants he met. Max spent the entire night drinking. He didn't sleep, and when he finally returned to the hotel at 6:30 in the morning, he was greeted by their quarterback bark star in the lobby, who was already up getting ready for the game. Max thought he wasn't going to play that day, and in the pre game meeting, he actually told their star wide receiver Boyd Dowler that he better not get hurt because Max was way too hungover to play. However, of course, his worst nightmare came true. Dowler separated his shoulder on the first drive, and coach

However, they designed it in a way for the Miami Dolphins to win more football games. The worst problem with the old stadium was how hot it would get. The Dolphins have by far the warmest stadium in football. The average home game is about 75 degrees and early in the season it could be over 100. The old stadium had no shade, so to solve that they added an open air canopy to make it cooler. But what many people don't know is that it's not shady for everyone. The stadium was made so that the opposing team sideline would be directly in the sun during day games, and the Dolphins are perfectly in the shade. This makes a massive difference. Last season the Vikings sideline when they came to Miami was 30 degrees hotter than the Dolphins. There's was 120 degrees compared to the Dolphins 90. On top of all that, the Dolphins, unlike most teams, force the opposing team to wear darker uniforms while they wear white. They do that?

So from Super Bowl 1 in 1967 all the way until the 90s, the NFL never spent more than $1,000 a year getting the field ready for the big game. And the whole process would only take about a week. But now the Super Bowl is a billion dollar event and over 100 million people are going to watch it. So that's why the NFL now spends nearly two years preparing the grass for each Super Bowl. And what's interesting is the grass being used this year may be an advantage for the Forty Niners. So for Super Bowl 57 last year in Scottsdale, Arizona, the grass was grown at a local farm for 18 months. Then a few weeks before the game, it was brought to the stadium where it would sit outside in the sun during the day and then rolled into the stadium at night to avoid the cold. The cost last year was $800,000. But if you remember, the field was actually terrible. Players on both teams were slipping everywhere. It was a disaster. They had to replace their cleats. So will it be better this?

The proper response, I seen a video online. We just gonna put a foot on the brake, the clutch, put it in neutral, drop that e brake and we ready to go hey, and now we moving in first gear wait, wait, wait, hold up my guy we can't just go on the streets in first gear. Did you learn how to break yet? Don't seem that hard. Obviously it's the same as an automatic. Why? The car just died. Oh, so you're not ready for the streets. Well, that's okay cause your boy got you when it comes to breaking in an automatic car, all you gotta do is step on the brakes and you're fine and dandy, right? Well, it doesn't always work like that in a manual car, don't get me wrong. For the most part, you can still use your brakes normally, but when you come to a full stop, car will literally shut off if you don't implement this tip. So let's say we're cruising around in third gear and then we see a stop sign, but all I'm gonna decide to do is step on the brakes and come to a full stop oh no, the car shut off. So instead, while you're coming to a full stop, you're gonna clutch in, take that Thing out of gear. And since it isn't neutral, you can remove your foot from the clutch and just step.

I hope none of you ever have to use this. But it doesn't hurt to remember if you're ever out and about, just driving around, and all of a sudden an egg gets splattered onto your windshield. Yes, you heard that correctly. An egg. 1. It's not a mistake, that egg was intended for you. 2. Whoever threw that egg is gonna try to rob you or potentially worse. Cause you never know how these situations are gonna go. Now if this ever happens to you, I know your gut instinct is telling you to use your windshield wipers. Do not, I repeat, do not hit those windshield wipers. Cause eggs, for some reason are really great at being smeared but not wiped up. Now if you were to ever hit your windshield wipers and is already covered in eggs. Hey, this area is where the egg hit, but the rest of my windshield is clear. Second you hit those windshield wipers, it's smearing it across your entire windshield. And now you just went from having partial visibility to absolutely zero visibility. And no matter how hard you try to wipe it off, it's not coming off. And I haven't even mentioned the fact that while all this is happening, the car that threw the egg at you is gonna be trailing you the entire time. Cause they're praying that you're gonna hit your windshield wipers. Cause if you do, that means You have to pull over, stop and get out of your car.

And you best believe no one else is gonna ask you afterwards to hop in their car and Rev theirs too.

Just as the police were at a loss, the second art piece appeared. The only difference this time was that the killer left behind a signature. The sheriff suddenly remembered that five years ago, a serial killer calling himself the artist had turned all his victims into sculptures. But that criminal had long since been captured. Officer Lisa, however, believed that this new murderer was merely a copycat. So why not go straight to the original artist for help? Perhaps he could provide useful clues. When Lisa arrived at the prison, the artist seemed to have expected her visit, even called out her name before she introduced herself. Lisa ignored it and immediately showed him photos of the victims turned statues. He pointed out that the killer used the exact same preservative formula as he did, which meant that this copycat must have some connection to the original artist. The artist responded with a slight smile, then agreed to assist in the investigation on one condition. He wanted all of his past art pieces to be moved into the prison. That way, he could compare them to the new works and find inconsistencies. Lisa quickly fulfilled his request, recreating his old workshop inside the prison. Analyzing the crime scene photos Lisa provided, the artist noticed something odd. He immediately instructed Lisa to check it. Sure enough, hidden within the right wing's feathers, He found a bottle of nail polish. The police took the bottle in for fingerprint analysis, but the prince had already been wiped clean. As the investigation hit another dead end, a third art piece appeared. This time, Lisa discovered that the victim's fingernails were painted in different colors. Between the fingers, she also found a compass needle. The sheriff instantly recognized it. It belonged to his old partner, Jack. But Jack had died five years ago during the artist capture. When Lisa asked about Jack's cause of death, Sheriff hesitated, mumbling that he had been hit by a car. Lisa immediately realized he was hiding something. Soon after, an even more bizarre artwork was found. Examining it closely, Lisa discovered a sundial placed beneath a candlestick. Remembering the compass needle from the previous victim, they immediately placed it on the sundial. After a few spins, the needle pointed to a puppet painting. Removing it, they found a cryptic message left behind by the killer, but no one could decipher its meaning. With no other choice, Lisa returned to the artist in prison. This time, he made another demand. If she wanted to uncover the killer's identity, she had to agree to one more condition to be his sculpture model. Determined to solve the case, Lisa reluctantly agreed. Following the artist's instructions, Lisa and the sheriff arrived at an address he provided. But the moment they stepped inside, they found the walls covered with photographs of Lisa.

So 10 years later, I abandoned them and got my revenge. I was 8 when my parents brought Steven home. He was 7, skinny, and had this way of crying that made adults panic. Within a month, I was invisible. Christmas that year, I got socks. Steven got a Nintendo 64. When I asked why, my mom said, he's been through so much. You're lucky you've always had us. I stopped asking after that. By the time I turned 13, the pattern was clear. Steven wanted pizza, we got pizza. I wanted Chinese. We already decided on pizza. My birthday parties got smaller every year until they stopped happening entirely. His got bigger. At 14, I made honor roll. Straight A's for the first time. I showed my parents the certificate, hands shaking with pride. My mom glanced at it, that's nice, sweetie, then turned to Steven, did you finish your homework? Steven was failing three classes. That same week, they bought him a four hundred dollar guitar because he said he might want to learn. It sat in the corner untouched for two years. When I asked for a twenty dollar calculator for math class, my dad said we couldn't afford it. I started stealing quarters from the couch to buy my own school supplies. The final straw came at 16. My parents planned a party at my favorite arcade. First time they've done anything for me in years. I Invited 12 friends. Spent weeks hyped. Three days before I overheard Steven on the phone. Yeah, just throw a fit the day before. They always cave. Then it'll be my part party, and he'll look like an idiot in front of his friends. He knew I was listening. He smiled at me. Day of, Steven threw his tantrum. Right on schedule. Said he wanted to go to the same arcade for his birthday next month. My parents caved. We'll celebrate you both today. Steven already cleared it with you, right? I hadn't even spoken to Steven that week. When I said no, my dad pulled me aside. Stop being selfish. He's fragile. You're not. They brought out one cake. Vanilla. Steven's favorite. I'm allergic to vanilla. I watched my friends eat my birthday cake while I sat in the corner with hives breaking out on my neck. Steven blew out the candles, made a wish, smiled at me. That night, I found out why they really adopted him. I wasn't supposed to see the letter, but it was sitting on my dad's desk.

And make sure everything is perfect this time, my husband added. I smiled and said, of course. But at 3:00am, I was at the airport instead. For five years, I've been the perfect daughter in law. I cooked elaborate holiday meals, hosted family gatherings and never complained when my husband, Hudson's mother, Vivian, turned every Celebration into a performance I was expected to orchestrate alone. This year, Vivian handed me a guest list three days before Thanksgiving, 32 people. She'd upgraded the menu, too. Three different stuffings, seven side dishes, four desserts, all from scratch. When I mentioned it seemed like a lot for one person, she waved her hand dismissively. Nonsense. You're perfectly capable. Besides, Hudson will help. Hudson's idea of help was carving the Turkey and opening wine bottles. Maybe an hour of work total while I handled 37 hours of preparation. The breaking point came when Vivian called at 3 a. M. The night before, worried I might not properly handle a guest's severe nut allergy. She'd forgotten to mention until then three of my prepared dishes contained nuts. I have to remake everything. Start cooking at 4 a. M, she instructed. Maybe 3:30 if you want everything perfect. But something had shifted inside me. I'd spent two days in preparation hell while Hudson played golf. I'd asked him for help and he told me I was so much better at cooking than He was. I'd mentioned feeling overwhelmed and he assured me I'd pull it off like always. That night, I sat at my kitchen table staring at the guest list, 32 names. Mine wasn't on it. I was cooking for 32 people and wasn't even considered a guest. That's when I noticed Hudson's cousin Ruby wasn't listed either. I called her and discovered Vivian had uninvited her after her divorce, saying she'd be more comfortable elsewhere since she was going through such a difficult time. Ruby had been family for eight years, but the moment she needed support instead of providing entertainment value, Vivian cut her loose. I saw my own future in that moment. One bad Thanksgiving away from being discarded myself. On impulse, I opened a travel website. The first result made my heart race. Last minute Thanksgiving getaway to Hawaii. Flight departs 4:15 a. M, exactly when I was supposed to start cooking. I booked it before I can change my mind. One ticket just for me. For the first time in five years, I was going somewhere Hudson hadn't approved of, somewhere Vivian hadn't vetted.

Like, actually lactose intolerant. Not the kind where people are like, oh, I just feel a little bloated. I mean, the kind where if I eat dairy, I'm gonna be stuck in the bathroom for, like, two hours straight, sweating and regretting every life choice that LED me to that moment. It's not cute, it's not fun. And I've told my boyfriend this about a million times, but every single time I make tacos for us, he does this thing where he goes on and on about how I'm disrespecting Mexican culture by not putting cheese on my tacos. He'll do this whole dramatic speech like he's some kind of food historian, talking about authenticity and tradition and whatever. And here's the kicker. He's not even Mexican. He's white. Like, his name is Tyler, and he grew up in the suburbs eating chicken nuggets and Mac and cheese from a box. Suddenly he's the taco police. I've told him so many times to knock it off. I've explained that I'm not trying to disrespect anyone. I just don't want to spend my entire evening camped out on the toilet. I've even offered to make his tacos with cheese if he wants, but he always says no and then continues making the same stupid jokes. It got old after, like, the second time, but he kept going. So last night, we're having tacos again. I made everything from scratch. Season the meat, chopped up all the toppings, laid everything out nice. I was actually pretty proud of how it all turned out. We sit down to eat, and of course, he starts up again with the cheese thing. I just rolled my eyes and ignored him because I was over it. I got up to go to the bathroom, just a normal, quick trip. And when I came back to the table, something looked off. My taco looked different, like someone had messed with it. I picked it up and started pulling back the lettuce and tomatoes, and there it was. Shredded cheese buried underneath everything, like he thought I wouldn't notice. I just stared at it for a second because I couldn't believe he actually did that. Like, what kind of person does that? Who tampered with someone's food? Especially when

So I divorced her, kept the business and our kids disowned her. Now she is begging to come back, claiming it was just a small hiccup in our relationship. Brenda and I had been together since we were 17. We built our dairy farm from nothing, raised four boys on that land, worked side by side every single day for 26 years. She knew every cow by name. She'd be up at 4:00am helping with the milk, looking covered in dirt and smiling about it. Then at 52, a friend convinced her to join this cosmetics company, some door to door sales thing. I encouraged her, told her she'd be great at it. She was always so good with people. At first it seemed harmless. She was excited, energized, made some sales, won some bonuses. Then the company bought her a brand new luxury German car for hitting some sales milestone. That's when everything started changing. Suddenly my wife, who wore t shirts and jeans her whole life, was driving to the city every week, coming back with bags from stores I'd never heard of, designer clothes, professional makeup, weekly nail appointments. The credit card bills were hitting $2,000, $3,000 a month just on her wardrobe. When I brought it up, she said this job is about image. No one's going to buy high end cosmetics from someone who looks Like she just came off the farm. The way she said it stung, but I thought maybe she had a point. She stopped helping around the farm completely. Stop asking about my day when I come in from working. She'd be on her laptop or phone barely looking up. Then in November, she told me about this big Mexico trip. The company was rewarding their top 10 sales people with an all expenses paid resort vacation in February. That's great, I said. I've never been to Mexico. When do we leave? Her face fell. Oh, it's employees only. No family allowed. I thought it was weird. But whatever. She'd worked hard. She deserved a vacation. February comes and she's gone for five days. I barely heard from her the entire time. Maybe three text messages total. No calls. I figured she was relaxing, unplugging like I told her to. When I picked her up from the airport, she wouldn't stop talking about Dom, her new sales director. Dom said this. I think that Dom is so driven. Dom really understands the business, she told me. He was 43, never been married, used to be a car salesman in Los Angeles. He's just so charming, she said, and he actually listens when I talk about my ideas. The way she lit up saying his name made my stomach turn, but I pushed it down, told myself I was being paranoid, jealous even. Two months later, I came inside for lunch and found A package on the kitchen table addressed to Brenda. The return label said Dom with a lot.

She now tried walking down the aisle at my wedding and I finally got payback. Growing up, my sister Brianna was the golden child, and I mean golden. When I was 7, I saved up birthday money for months to buy this doll I wanted. The day I brought it home, Brianna threw a tantrum saying she wanted it. My parents made me give it to her because she's more sensitive and needs extra love. I cried for hours. They grounded me for making Brianna feel bad with my crying. At 13, I got straight A's for the first time. My parents took me and Brianna how to celebrate at the restaurant Brianna picked with the cake flavour Brianna liked even though I hate chocolate. When I asked why my achievement party was all about her, my dad said I was being selfish and ungrateful. Brianna smirked at me the whole dinner. At 16, I worked after school for eight months and saved $2,000 for a used car. My parents found my savings envelope hidden in my closet and took it. They used my money to pay for Brianna's driving lessons and insurance because she needed a car more than me since she had anxiety about taking the bus. When I begged for it back, they said family helps family. I didn't get a single dollar back. Brianna got her license in a car while I took the bus. For two more years, every single time Brianna came first, I stopped expecting anything different. Fast forward 10 years, I'm engaged to the most amazing guy, Logan. I didn't want Brianna in the wedding at all, but my parents called me crying. If Brianna isn't the maid of honour, we're not coming. We'll tell the whole family you excluded your sister on purpose. I caved because I didn't want the drama. Biggest mistake of my life. During rehearsal, Brianna started her comments. White isn't really your colour. You'd look better in cream or maybe blush. This song's too slow for the bridesmaids. It'll drag and bore people. Oh, and I've been thinking I should walk down the aisle, too, right before you. It would look so elegant having both sisters make an entrance. People will love it. I shut her down hard. No changes. This is my wedding, not yours, she pouted. But I thought that was the end of it. Wedding day arrives. I'm in the bridal suite getting ready when my coordinator rushes in panic. Your sister brought a white dress, like wedding white, she says it's cream, but it's white. White. I told her to handle it and just keep Brianna away from me until the ceremony. The ceremony starts. My bridesmaids walk down perfectly. Then suddenly the music changes. Not my chosen song. I look up, confused, and Brianna standing at the.

I know, but still you don't gotta touch it. Like, dang, it's there. So boundaries.

She. Yeah. And she had. We were just hugging each other, and she was like, I killed my friend. And I was like, no, it was an accident. My friend, she lost her life. And I just kept asking if she was still alive. Even when I got to the hospital, I was still, like, asking. And I was just telling her when I was with her that I was really sorry and I love her. She takes all the blame herself. Even though it was an accident. If I could take the pain away from her, I would take it in a second. I can handle it down here. I got a picture of my friend's cross where we had wrecked that. So I got that right there. So I can wake up to it every morning and talk to her at night. Anjane's mom forgives me and still loves me. But I felt like I wasn't getting any type of punishment for it. And I felt like I needed to go away to get help. From what I know, she didn't have to come here. That just shows a lot of integrity on her part. That makes you good. Feel good about helping her, you know, cause she. She wants to pay her debt, so. Student twine is one of our exceptional students here. Um, she does have a burgundy, which didn't take her long to get. She thinks she's better. Than me. Cause she chose to come here. You still here? I wanna choose to come here. I don't like to tell people my charges. They just throw it up in my face and call me all kinds of stuff. Cause I already feel bad about it. So, like, for them to say what I already feel like kind of makes me like 10 times worse. That makes me feel really, like, bad. It really does hurt. Because that night changed my life forever.

For the past two years, I've watched her do this weird ritual at every elevator bank. She'll walk up to each one, press her ear against the door, and sometimes straight up refuse to get on. Always with some excuse about bad vibrations or something feeling off. Last month at the mall, she made us wait 20 minutes for a different elevator because the first one sounded wrong when she rejected. Worked perfectly fine all day. I started calling her the Elevator Whisperer as a joke, but honestly, it was getting embarrassing. The worst part was how she'd get this serious, almost scared look on her face when she'd reject one, like she was genuinely terrified of something the rest of us couldn't see or hear. Last Thursday, we're running late for her dream job interview at this prestigious law firm downtown. 22nd floor of this gorgeous glass building she'd been preparing for weeks. We rush into the lobby, and there's three elevators. Two have long lines of business people checking their phones. The middle one is completely empty, doors wide open, practically begging us to hop in. Christie freezes at the elevator bank, tilting her head like she's listening to something. Not that one, she whispers, pointing at the empty elevator. Her face has gone completely pale. I check my watch. We're already 15 minutes late. Christie, seriously? Today of all days? She backs Away from the middle elevator. Shaking her head. I can hear it in the motor. Something's grinding that shouldn't be grinding. The cable sound loose. The other two elevators

His domestic partner is also there. Everything is fine. And then suddenly a piece of jewelry went missing and they allegedly blamed the 16 year old. That is when the two of them tortured this girl for at least 4 days, ending her life with a billiard ball down her throat over jewelry. His name is Steven Grass. He is 35. And she is Michelle Brandis. She's 37. And most importantly, this is Miranda Corset. Miranda had been on a dating website. When she met Steve, they started talking and he invited her over to the house. Everything went fine that first day and she goes back home. She had been living with her grandmother because both of her parents have passed away and she also has an 11 month old baby. So the following day she decides to go back over to their home and she never came home. And unfortunately, because she has frequently just left and not came back, the grandma didn't report it because she assumed she just went off again, which is honestly so awful in itself. So she then goes back. She's at their home. That's when the jewelry goes missing. That's when they torture her. That's when they take her life. And then the two of them dismember her and throw her in a freaking trash can. Right now the police believe that her Body is in a landfill because of her history. This is not taken seriously. I don't understand how anyone could do this to anyone for literally any reason. As of now, they are charged and they are sitting in a jail cell. And I hope Miranda receives justice. And I am begging every teenager, learn from her mistake that she did not get the chance to learn from.

For weeks I've been packing Jake's usual Turkey sandwich, apple slices, and those expensive organic crackers. He loved, the kind that cost $6 a box that he'd beg for at the grocery store with his puppy dog eyes. But every day everything came back untouched except the sandwich. When I asked why, he just shrugged and mumbled something about not being hungry. Maybe his growth spurt was over. I thought kids go through phases. His teacher, Miss Rodriguez, said he seemed fine during lunch, sitting with the same group of boys he always did. Very social, she'd said during our parent conference. No concerns whatsoever. But then Jake started losing weight. Dark circles under his eyes, like he wasn't sleeping. He'd come home exhausted and immediately crash on the couch, skipping his usual after school Xbox time. He even stopped wearing his favorite Pokemon shirt, the one he'd worn twice a week since third grade. I started noticing other changes too. He'd flinch whenever I mentioned school events. Asked if we could skip the fall carnival this year, which was bizarre because he'd been counting down since August. Last Tuesday, I decided to surprise him with lunch at school. He'd forgotten his water bottle that morning, and I figured I'd drop it off and maybe grab a quick photo for Instagram. I signed in at the office, got my visitor badge, and headed to the cafeteria with his Forgotten Marvel water bottle. That's when I saw it. Jake was sitting alone at the end of a long table, methodically eating his plain sandwich, while four other boys sat at the opposite end laughing loudly. His usual snacks, crackers, fruit snacks, and juice box I'd packed were lined up in front of them like a buffet. I watched one kid, clearly the ring leader, with perfectly styled hair.

I specially prepared tickets to an art exhibition and museum, but they didn't seem to enjoy it much. Fine. What do you guys want to do? Ah! Pull the chute. Pull the chute. As someone who always prioritizes work, this was my first time doing something so thrilling. I'll never have sex with her again. I went to pull the parachute release. That's my cock, you idiot!

Later that night, we went to a bar, which LED to me not being sober before work the next day. Yuck. Shortly after arriving at the office, several robbers suddenly rushed in. They took me to the vault door. Well, that. That was. That was. That was an extremely lucky guess. So you know about the fingerprint bypass? Shut up! There's no. How did you. She left me roses by the stairs. Don't fuck with me. She left Me? Roses by the stairs. Surprises. Let me know she cares. Thanks for letting me out. You're welcome. They stole a million dollars from the vault. What I least expected was. Thank you for your cooperation, everyone. Especially you, Owen. You. At the police station, I calmed down and thought carefully. You deal with the security. It's 4, 0, 9, 6, 6, 8, 6, 0. It's easy. By the stair. The detective asked what impression I had of the robbers. No, no, can't. They were wearing masks. The detective suspected it was the ghost robbers. They had robbed over 100 banks and haven't been caught to this day. After returning home, my kind future in laws even gave me a car. Which made me even more uneasy.
